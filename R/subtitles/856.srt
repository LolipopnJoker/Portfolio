That's terrible.

a deer jumped out in front of me.

can get out of this shitty town?

677
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,380
- Hey, Grandma!
- EARL: Sorry, nobody's home.

678
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,380
- That asshole is married!
- Come on, Dad.

679
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,724
- TAMMY: He's married!
- EARL: Sorry, darling, the inn is closed.

680
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,500
I'm sorry, but he is an asshole.

681
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,900
I agree. He's a little bit
of an asshole. I can't...

682
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,100
(BOTH SIGH)

683
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,380
Will you do me a favor?

684
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,900
My mom is home alone and she's sick,
and I need to get back with her.

685
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,121
So do you have like a pen or
something I could borrow real quick?

686
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,967
Yeah, I think so.

687
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,340
All right. Look. If they come out
of there at a certain point...

688
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,820
just give me a call and
I'll come pick him up.

689
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,660
Here.

690
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,650
Thank you.

691
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,681
I knew you were into me.

692
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,171
I got your digits.

693
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,460
Sorry, that was stupid.
That was dumb.

694
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,940
BOBBY: All right, Tammy.

695
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,300
Thanks for holding down the fort.
I appreciate it.

696
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,406
Yeah, I'll watch him.

697
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,860
Appreciate it.

698
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,340
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

699
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,207
Thanks. Bye, Bobby.

700
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,460
Bye.

701
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,060
PEARL: Oh! Yes, Earl.

702
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,500
You know who she fucked?
Duane Allman.

703
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,940
Yeah, she fucked the
wrong Allman Brother.

704
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,100
Enjoy that.

705
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,060
- It's 119, Grandma. I said it. 119, 119.
- 119. 119.

706
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,500
Could you not do...?
Can I just have my shit back?

707
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,500
No, no. Come on. A gentleman
always carries a lady's things.

708
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,380
- Oh, bingo. 119. You're right. 119.
- Yeah, great.

709
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,540
So you wanna come in for, um...

710
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,660
- ...some color TV or sex?
- Yeah. Mm.

711
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,060
No. We had a deal.

712
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,820
Yeah. Bullshit.
Don't you dare. Don't you dare.

713
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,300
You are too old to be this strong.

714
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,980
Open this door, Grandma. Goddamn it.

715
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,660
Hey, Tammy.

716
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,460
- We need some ice, baby. Okay?
- Yeah. Fuck you, Earl.

717
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,660
- Fuck you.
- EARL: Aw. Ow.

718
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,003
- Come on.
- TAMMY: Oh. Aah!

719
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh, shit.

720
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,180
I gotta...

721
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,569
I gotta pee.

722
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,881
All right. Let's go for B2.

723
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,140
You piece of shit.

724
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,641
(BEEPS)

725
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,287
I paid for you.

726
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,766
Come on, you tasty motherfucker.

727
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,420
Yeah, now who wins?

728
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,160
Me.

729
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,925
Tammy?

730
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,801
Hey, Tammy.

731
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,611
Tammy.

732
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,243
Tammy, what are you doing out here?

733
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,700
Oh.

734
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,123
They wouldn't let me in the room.

735
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,089
You slept outside?

736
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,060
Oh, my God. Here, let me
help you up. Come here.

737
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,820
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Of course.

738
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,845
Oh. You're all dirty.

739
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,571
She took my keys...

740
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,380
and I just didn't want them driving
off and doing something stupid.

741
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,201
That's why I gave you my number.
You should have called me.

742
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,020
Oh, I didn't think you meant that.

743
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,491
I said it. I meant it. Okay?

744
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,540
All right, Dad, come on. We gotta go.

745
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,180
I'm sorry about all this.

746
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,940
Well, I mean, you didn't do it.

747
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm the one who's supposed to
be keeping him out of trouble.

748
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,540
I don't think you're very good at it.

749
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,001
- Ha, ha. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm tired.
- No, I think you might be right.

750
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,180
Oh, God.

751
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,420
Tammy, what are you doing out here?

752
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,968
All right. Let's go, boy.

753
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,567
Dad. Truck's this way.

754
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,564
Gotcha.

755
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,489
- Well...
- Well.

756
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,324
I guess this is goodbye again.

757
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,180
Yep.

758
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,967
I'll take care of that one.
You take care of that one?

759
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,524
Okay.

760
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,530
- See you, Bobby.
- See you, Tammy.

761
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,407
Thanks again.

762
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,845
Yep.

763
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,480
- SERVER: Get that out of your way. Sure.
- I am so hungry. Thank you. Mm.

764
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,780
It's been such a long time since
I've had a good servicing.

765
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,740
You know what I mean? Ha, ha.

766
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,811
Pass me the ketchup. Please.

767
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,206
You know, I didn't bring you
on this trip to babysit you.

768
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,180
You are on this trip because of me.

769
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,140
Because of my car and my money. What's
left of it. So you just watch your mouth.

770
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,780
Yeah, I'm too busy watching you screw
crusty old men in dirty hotel rooms.

771
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,180
Oh, God, here we go. You gonna
blame me for everything, like always?

772
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,380
I do. I blame you for shoving me
out of a hotel room last night...

773
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,260
and letting me sleep
outside like a dog.

774
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,420
You're on your second Bloody Mary.
It's not even 10 a.m.

775
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,260
This is vegetables.

776
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,700
I blame you for packing up your shit and making
me come home from school when I was 10...

777
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,660
and finding an empty room,
that's what I blame you for.

778
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,460
You know how shitty that was for
a little kid? You left me all alone.

779
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,180
- Your parents were there.
- TAMMY: It's not the same.

780
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,967
You were my best friend,
and you just left me.

781
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,980
I'm probably gonna need a tetanus shot
because I got nipped by a raccoon last night.

782
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,900
All right. Tammy, I know I've done
some wrong things in my life...

783
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,540
but you don't know everything.

784
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,620
I know I don't need you,
and I don't need your money.

785
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,700
- But I'm gonna take your car.
- What?

786
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,740
- Let's see how you like getting left.
- Don't you leave me here.

787
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,020
You cannot leave me here.
You come back here.

788
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,340
All right, now sit down.

789
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,491
TAMMY: Anybody wanna screw
my grandma? Just get her a drink.

791
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,900
- Hi, Mom.
- DEB (OVER PHONE): Tammy, put Grandma on.

792
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,100
Uh, she's in the bathroom right now.

793
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,180
Tammy, she left all
of her pills here.

794

High blood pressure, heart,
everything. She's diabetic.

795
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,580
She cannot go unmedicated.

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,340
Do you understand what I'm saying?

797
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,300
- I get that.
- Listen to me.

798
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,007
She thinks she can handle it,
but she can't.

799
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,740
- Tammy.
- Yeah, I know she can't.

800
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,180
- Bye, Mom.
- I don't think you do, because you...

801
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,820
Tammy. Don?

802
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,970

- I told you you can't drink in here.

- PEARL: One. Two.
- I'm calling the cops.

809
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,660
- You don't have to call the cops. I got her.
- Oh. Well.

Look who came back.

811
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,180
Yeah. I came back.

- You did it, huh?
- What?

813
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,740
Drunk by 11.

814
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,005
Mm. Ah. What do I win?

815
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,491
Car ride with me.

816
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,740
Come on. I'm pretty
sure you've had enough.

ingredient is. Try some.

819
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,580
Is it whiskey?

No. It's whiskey. Ha-ha-ha.

- PEARL: This is mine.

- I need my beer.
- TAMMY: You got beer?

824

Yeah. I got beer.

825
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,820
- They're still in the store.
- PEARL: Bye.

826
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,580
Okay, we're leaving right now.

827
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,607

- All right. Watch it.
- PEARL: Oh, hey.

- TAMMY: What?

830
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,420
Yeah, nice try.
I'm not buying you beer.

831
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,420
No, you don't have to. I already bought it
for them because these are my new friends.

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,260
This is Jesse. And the girl.

833
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,380
And we have an arrangement...

834
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,885
where I'm getting them the beer, and
they're gonna give me a ride out of here.

835
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,980
How? On their bikes?

836
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,820
The fucking old lady promised
us a beer, so give it to me.

grandma, you piece of shit.

Hey, you're being a real bitch, lady.

Don't say "lady." I'm not
that much older than you.

840
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,740
What do you care? If you don't give
us beer, we're gonna turn to drugs...

841
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,820
I hope you do drugs. I want you to do
bath salts and then eat her face off.

00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,900
- You like apple?
- TAMMY: I do like apple.

1011
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,580
But don't make me... I don't wanna
have to choose between you.

1012
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,180
Choose Larry.

1013
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,140
TAMMY: Larry, she's telling
me to take you out.

1014
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,740
It's just, you're so
much older, you know?

1015
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,380
- TAMMY: Oh, my gosh.
- I'm a veteran.

1016
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,020
- TAMMY: That's amazing.
- BECKY: Yeah.

1017
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,260
TAMMY: I'm gonna have
to put you in the cooler.

1018
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,540
Come on, let's go.
Today. Get your pies.

1019
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,900
Let's go.

1020
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,927
Larry, it's a real honor.
I wanna thank you for your service.

1021
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,500
Here.

1022
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,980
Don't know if it's a blanket or
a towel, but it'll keep you warm.

1023
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,405
I'll call the cops in 10 minutes
and let them know you're in here.

1024
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,885
Damn it.

1025
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,330
Shit. Come on.

1026
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,804
Oh...

1027
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,810
Come on.

1028
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,380
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1029
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,980
Oh.

1030
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,300

- CARTY: Name?
- PEARL: Tammy?

1034
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,850
- Where have you been?
- What?

1035
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,420
- Uh, never mind. Yeah.
- Okay.

1036
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,001
Let's go.

1037
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,700
- Well, slow down, slow down.
- Okay, I'm sorry. Okay?

1038
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,220
How did you even get out?

1039
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,500
Well, I called Earl...

1040
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,460
and he very generously had Bobby
wire the bail money to the station.

1041
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,610
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1042
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,380
What are you doing with oxy?
I mean, whose pills are those?

1043
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,580
Well, they're mine.
My foot was hurting...

1044
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,340
and my pills weren't working, so I
asked the Robinson boy if he had any.

1045
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,980
- Eugene? Eugene's a drug dealer.
- PEARL: Uh-huh.

1046
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,740
Oh, no.

1047
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,580
Yeah, he stands on the street and
sells drugs in little sandwich bags.

1048
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,020
- Did you think he was a pharmacist?
- PEARL: He's organized.

In other news, there was a robbery
at the Oaktree Topperjack's.

1053
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,620
Two employees were held at gunpoint.
Michelle Li joining us live at the scene.

1054
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,780
Oh, shit.

1055
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,940
Authorities are describing this
person as 5'2", white, female.

1056
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,540
The robber had a navy T-shirt featuring
a bear with "Mahalo" written on it.

1057
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,460
The robber was last seen driving...

1058
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,460
an older-model Cadillac,
hauling a Jet Ski.

1059
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,060
The suspect made off with $1600...

1060
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,325
- That's quite a coincidence. Huh?
- LI: ...and 13 signature pies.

1061
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,580
Yeah, and she was super bossy.

1062
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,340
But she did give us pies,
so that was cool.

1063
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,490
LI: We're certainly
glad that you're sa...

1064
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,140
What have you done?

1065
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,610
Sit down. Right now. Sit down.

1066
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,564
Well?

1067
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,340
- Well, your feet were really puffy...
- Yeah.

1068
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,060
...and they looked really messed up.

1069
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,724
I didn't know how else to
get that kind of money.

1070
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,460
And I was afraid if I didn't
get you out of there...

1071
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,726
something bad was
gonna happen to you.

1072
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,450
And I just always screw stuff up,
and I didn't wanna...

1073
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,220
- I didn't wanna screw that up.
- Oh, sweetie.

1074
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,140
My sweet, sweet, sweet girl. Oh.

1075
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,005
I'm sorry.

1076
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,620
Look at me. You have to
take that money back.

1077
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,408
If you don't take it back,
I'm gonna turn you in myself.

1078
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,321
You gotta take the money back.

1079
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,689
You gotta take the pies back.

1080
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,820
All right?

1081
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,980
I can't really take
all the pies back.

1082
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,740
Why not?

1083
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,420
Oh, okay.

1084
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,208
- I kind of got into them.
- Okay.

1085
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,008
You're more bad-ass
than I ever thought.

1086
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,580
I think you take after
your grandma after all.

1087
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,570
Hmm?

1088
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,660
All right.

1089
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,260
- We'll fix it tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1090
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,489
We'll fix it.

1091
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,140
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1092
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,220
- I'm not wearing it.
- I just made it for you.

1093
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,260
It's full of grease. Look at this.

1094
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,460
- Can you put it on before someone sees us?
- You realize how much it clogs your veins...

1095
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,780
- TAMMY: Put it on. You're killing me.
- All right.

1096
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,740
TAMMY:
You have to argue about everything.

1097
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,368
PEARL:
Oh, that's kind of calming, actually.

1098
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,940
Just throw the money through the
window and we'll get out of here.

1099
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,569
TAMMY: All right. Fine. Here we go.

1100
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,380
(SCREAMS)

1101
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,100
- TAMMY: Oh, God. No, I'm returning it.
- PEARL: She's returning the money.

1102
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,340
- TAMMY: I'm returning the money to you.
- I'm calling the police.

1103
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,060
Oh, no. We're gonna need more pies.

1104
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,820
TAMMY: I'm not robbing you.
I'm giving it back.

1105
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,740
God, stop freaking out. Stop crying.

1106
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,500
I'm returning this to you.

1107
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,561
PEARL: Listen carefully.
Keep the car running.

1108
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,620
No, just relax. It's okay.
Everything's normal. It's cool.

1109
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,180
My, uh, bandit partner, she just
accidentally robbed you last night.

1110
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,740
She didn't really mean it.

1111
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,460
And here's the money back.
No hard feelings.

1112
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,166
Are you the grandma?

1113
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,180
PEARL: Look right here.

1114
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,889
None of this happened.
None of this happened.

1115
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,980
Just relax. None of this happened.

1116
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,940
Oh. What are you doing?

1117
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,900
- TAMMY: You said "Come a-running."
- PEARL: I said "Keep the car running."

1118
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,940
- TAMMY: You need to be more articulate.
- PEARL: I have a bag on my head.

1119
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,660
And by the way, why does mine have no
expression and yours has a smiley face?

1120
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,980
TAMMY: It's not smiling.
I'm showing tiger teeth.

1121
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,340
PEARL: Oh, I thought it was
a mustache and a smile.

1122
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,140
- TAMMY: Just go. Go, go.
- PEARL: Come on, let's get out of here.

1123
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,722
TAMMY: Don't be a hero!

1124
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,340
- Hey.
- TAMMY: Hey. Where's Larry?

1125
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,900
- He has the day off. He's pretty shaken up.
- TAMMY: Oh.

1126
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,300
Just tell him hi.

1127
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,881
Okay.

1128
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,180

Watch the curb, watch the curb.

- Hey. It's been too long.

Too long. Sweetie, you look so great.

Aw. It's great to see you.

- PEARL: Come here.
- Aw. Is this little Tammy?

1143
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,220
Look at you.

1144
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:34,220
Oh. Darling, last time I saw you,
you were knee-high to a grasshopper.

1145
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,940
- Yeah, I'm taller.
- LENORE: Yes, you are.

1146
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,100
- You don't remember me, do you?
- No, I do.

1147

- You wanna see some ID? Family album?
- TAMMY: Ha, ha.

- She got a sense of humor?
- Yes. Sometimes.

1149

- Oh, darling. How's your mom?
- TAMMY: Good, I think.

1150
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,460
You know, not real thrilled
with us at the moment.

1151
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,420
Yeah, Pearly filled me in.

1152
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,380
You knocked over a Topperjack's?

1153
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,940
- Grandma.
- Lenore's cool.

1154

That the vehicle you
perpetrated your crime with?

- TAMMY: Yeah.
- LENORE: Okay.

1156
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,260
This is what we're gonna do.
Get in there and take everything out.

1157
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,980
Clean everything out of it,
all the evidence, okay?

1158
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,340
You're on the lam.

1159
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,260
You're a fugitive from justice.
Think about it that way.

1160
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,300
- Jesus.
- And we'll pull that trailer off.

1161
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,580
- And I'll pop those plates, okay?
- Okay, what do you want me to do?

1162
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,460
Oh, honey, why don't you hunker on back
down there in that RV, put your feet up?

- I got this covered.
- Okay.

- Alrighty.
- All right.

for robbing a store?

1498
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,407
I'm so sorry.

1499
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,443
I'm so sorry.

1500
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,365
Shit.

1501
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,804
Hey!

1502
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,940
- She's not breathing. She's dead.
- LENORE: What?

1503
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,540
- Oh, my God, what?
- TAMMY: She's dead.

1504
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,020
Oh, Robin, call 911.

1505
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,020
- TAMMY: She's dead. She's not breathing at all.
- You can't be serious.

1506
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,220
What's happened?

1507
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,980
She's not breathing, and I
just let her drink all night.

1508
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,860
- LENORE: No, no, honey. It's not your fault.
- TAMMY: It is my fault.

1509
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,620
Tammy, it's not your fault.
Oh, my God. What happened?

1510
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,380
(SCREAMING)

1511
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,450
Pearl! Oh, my God!

1512
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,860
Oh, God! Oh, my God, Pearl!

1513
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,964
Pearl!

1514
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,380
What the fuck?!

1515
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,460
- What the fuck?
- What happened?

1516
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,420
LENORE: Go get her.

1517
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,660
- Oh, my God.
- SUSANNE: She's not dead.

1518
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,060
- TAMMY: on, my God.
- PEARL: What?

1519
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,540
- TAMMY: Sit. Okay, okay.
- I think she passed out.

1520
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,660
- TAMMY: What were you thinking?
- What?

1521
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,700
You weren't breathing.
We all thought you were dead.

1522
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,300
You are gonna clean your shit up.
You're gonna stop all this drinking.

1523
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,380
Do you hear me? You look terrible.

1524
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,180
Well, my feet...
I don't feel so good.

1525
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,860
Goddamn it, Pearly.

1526
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,761
Nobody should die in a lawn chair.

1527
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,580
TAMMY: All right. All right,
don't shake her, don't shake her.

1528
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,100
Don't bounce her so much.

1529
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,100
Remember, she's not taking all of her
pills she's supposed to be taking.

1530
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,409
EMT: Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

1531
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,540
Did I flash my boobs last night?

1532
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,540
- TAMMY: Yeah. You did.
- Did I?

1533
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,020
Yeah. You were throwing
them around last night.

1534
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:59,260
Beep, boop. All the way. Yeah,
Earl has them all over Facebook.

1535
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,260
TAMMY: They look good. I mean...

1536
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,060
Oh, my God.

1537
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,540
Oh, my God, I was mean...

1538
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,804
Oh, I was mean to you.

1539
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,740
I called you Cheeseburger.
Oh, my God.

1540
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,860
- It's okay.
- SUSANNE: Pearly, we'll be right behind, okay?

1541
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,820
- TAMMY: It's okay. It's okay.
- PEARL: Oh, no.

1542
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,402
- SUSANNE: We'll follow, okay?
- TAMMY: Yeah.

1543
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,121
Oh, shit.

1544
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,820
Hey, officers.

1545
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,220
Ambulance got here first,
but she's gonna be okay.

1546
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,100
So don't worry about it.
Thank you, though.

1547
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,700
Ma'am, we got reports that someone was
burning a Jet Ski on the lake last night.

1548
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,620
- You see anything?
- Oh.

1549
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:43,820
Uh, it's super uncool.
I would never burn a watercraft.

1550
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,340
- Oh, no.
- No.

1551
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,620
No?

1552
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,380
We've also been tracking
a 2004 Cadillac de Ville...

1553
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,884
towing a Jet Ski that was involved
in a robbery. Anything on that?

1554
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,220
Uh...

1555
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,180
You know, uh... Ooh, wow.

1556
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,890
That's a Hawaiian bear shirt.
You don't see a lot of those around here.

1557
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,620
You probably see quite a few.

1558
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,540
You're gonna have to
come with us. Let's go.

1559
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,420
- TAMMY: Oh. Come on, man.
- Let's go, ma'am.

1560
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,820
Stand back, ladies. Right this way.

1561
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,500
TAMMY: I'm going with...

1562
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,980
- I bet you see a lot of bear shirts.
- OFFICER: No, no, ma'am.

1563
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,420
- Constant.
- OFFICER: Ma'am. Get...

1564
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,340
- Are you serious?
- TAMMY: Ow. There was a bee.

1565
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,780
- There's no bees here, ma'am.
- There was a bee.

1566
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,884
You can't run from the law.

1567
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,740
GUARD 1: Tammy Banks.

1568
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,890
GUARD 2: On the gate.

1569
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,740
See you later.

1570
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,163
I hope not.

1571
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,220
Hey, Dad.

1572
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,220
Tammy. You rehabilitated?

1573
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,441
- I guess.
- Then let's go home.

1574
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,300
Wherever that is.

1575
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,420
Yeah. I'm not too happy with Greg.

1576
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,340
Yeah, me either.

1577
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,569
Look, um...

1578
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,281
you want me to take care of that
wiggly little motherfucker for you?

1579
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,921
- What? - I'll go over there
and kill him for you right now.

1580
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:20,180
I'm old. I don't care
if I go to jail.

1581
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:22,284
They got magazines
in there, don't they?

1582
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,980
Oh.

1583
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:28,121
I thought you were serious
for a minute. Heh...

1584
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,100
You're kidding, right?

1585
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,260
Jesus, Dad.

1586
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,620
You know we're at a prison. Okay?

1587
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:39,140
I do not want you to
hurt Greg in any way.

1588
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,483
God.

1589
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,049
You know, Grandma told me
that she made a pass at you.

1590
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,321
Heh. Oh, yeah, well, she used to
hit on everybody all the time.

1591
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,340
You know the ice-cream
guy, Jerry Miller?

1592
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,810
He was the only one who went for it.

1593
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,740
Oh, God.

1594
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,820
Let's roll. Mom's waiting.

1595
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,970
TAMMY: Oh, God.

1596
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,700
You don't have to go
in there right now.

1597
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,123
Now's a good a time as any.

1598
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,740
- Hey, Tammy.
- Hey, Greg.

1599
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,980
Come on in.

1600
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,561
- TAMMY: Really?
- Yeah.

1601
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,161
Well, see you kind of made
yourself at home, huh?

1602
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,449
Bold.

1603
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,964
Uh...

1604
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:02,220
Just wanted to, you know,
let you guys know that I'm okay.

1605
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,820
You know? With me.

1606
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,460
Not so much what
you guys did that's...

1607
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,820
I mean, you know,
that's really between you...

1608
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,860
and that guy upstairs.

1609
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,900
But I think he frowns on adultery.

1610
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,085
I'd say that, so I think
you burn, actually.

1611
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,404
So I'm just gonna get my stuff.

1612
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,007
MISSI:
I, uh... I folded your clothes.

1613
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,300
- So glad you're home.
- Thanks for letting me stay here.

1614
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,290
Oh, yeah.

1615
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,060
You look good.

1616
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,340
- TAMMY: Yeah?
- Yeah.

1617
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,260
- Prison agree with me? Heh.
- Heh. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

1618
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,444
Think it kind of did.

1619
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,020
I got your room all set up so...

1620
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,460
- Yeah?
- DEB: Yeah.

1621
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,420
Oh, God. I'm not bunking
with Grandma, am I?

1622
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,660
- No. Heh. She's at Brookview.
- TAMMY: What?

1623
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,900
Did you lock her up?
That is bullshit!

1624
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,180
- Give me your car keys, Dad.
- Tammy, wait!

1625
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,650
- I'm gonna remember that when you get old.
- DEB: Tammy.

1626
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,971
Hey!

1627
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,300
- Hey, super-old guy, where's Pearl Baizen?
- What?

1628
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,370
Oh, God.

1629
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,161
Come on, man.

1630
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,460
Grandma.

1631
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,740
Tammy!

1632
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,220
I didn't know you were coming.
Come here, give me a hug.

1633
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,340
TAMMY: Look at you.
It's worse than I thought.

1634
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:50,561
PEARL: Why do you have to go so fast?
All right, everybody. I'll be back.

1635
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,340
TAMMY: I got the car. Let's go.

1636
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,100
- Goddamn it. Ooh.
- I'll get the door.

1637
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,980
You could've killed me.
What are you thinking?

1638
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,860
Just stop. Do you hear me?

1639
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,300
Oh, my God. You can still walk.

1640
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,300
Of course I can walk. I was
teaching an exercise class.

1641
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,980
Why were you sitting in a wheelchair?

1642
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,180
Because most of them
are in wheelchairs.

1643
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,540
Well, why didn't you tell
me you were in here?

1644
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,700
I didn't wanna make you jealous.

1645
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,580
I mean, you were in jail,
and I'm at this cool place.

1646
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,300
And my AA meetings are here.

1647
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,860
I made friends, and I'm seeing
this 84-year-old from Philly.

1648
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,601
He was a hockey player,
so he seems younger but...

1649
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,361
We've been going kind of slow,
and this might be the weekend.

1650
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,161
Ugh.

1651
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,580
You look good.

1652
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,620
Thanks. You look great.

1653
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:42,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1654
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,380
I was afraid to eat
the meat in jail, so...

1655
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,291
- That's a good call.
- Yeah.

1656
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:52,940
God. I am so sorry.
So sorry about everything.

1657
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,780
I'm sorry.

1658
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,660
I was a total jerk to you, and I
should've taken better care of you.

1659
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,140
No, it wasn't your job
to take care of me.

1660
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,642
Little bit, it was.

1661
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,740
No, I love you so much. I really do.

1662
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,380
Well, I'm pretty great.

1663
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,882
You are really great.

1664
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,331
I love you too.

1665
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,700
We're gonna spend tonight at
Lenore's and get up early...

1666
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,300
- ...and drive straight to Niagara Falls.
- Call me when you get to Lenore's.

1667
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,041
- All right, I will, Mom.
- Don't forget.

1668
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,291
- Mom, I've got it, okay?
- DEB: Okay, great.

1669
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:32,761
- Stay hydrated.
- All right.

1670
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,900
Ah. Okay.

1671
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,620
- Well, thanks for fixing up my car, Dad.
- Oh, not a problem.

1672
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,966
- Just don't rob anybody in it.
- I'm not gonna rob anybody in it.

1673
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,020
Let's light this candle.

1674
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,860

1675
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,660
Let's go, woman.

- PEARL: I got it.
- You're strong.

1677
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,900
Ooh.

1678
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,528
Dukes of Hazzard-style.

1679
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,220
TAMMY: Lenore stocked up the RV,
so we're all good to go.

Oh, God. It's Jerry Miller.

Ladies. Who wants a bone cone?

1683
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,362
- Go, go. Just go.
- Okay.

1684
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,764
PEARL: Ugh.

1685
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,900
So, what do you think, Grandma?
It's a good day to go to Niagara Falls?

1686
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,140
I'm ready.

1687
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:33,771
My daddy always said that Niagara Falls
is the closest thing to heaven on earth.

Oh!

1691
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,446
(MOUTHS) Sorry.

1692
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,369
What are you doing here?

1693
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,420
So how'd you know to come
here to Niagara, anyway?

1694
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,860
A little birdie told me.

1695
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,567
- Is the bird named Pearl? Ha, ha.
- Yes.

1696
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,020
So, what's going on with you,
Tammy? What's next?

1697
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,420
Thinking about getting my
own place in Louisville.

1698
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,445
- Really?
- Yeah.

1699
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,887
- Interesting.
- TAMMY: Yeah, it is. Isn't it?

1700
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,100
Get myself a sweet little place...

1701
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:22,660
and, you know, maybe you can
come over and watch a movie.

1702
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,940
Do you guys feel how the
falls are charging the ions?

1703
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,860
- It's incredible, right?
- BOBBY & TAMMY: Yes.

1704
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,380
- Romantic.
- Yeah, it is.

(TAMMY CLEARS THROAT)

1706
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,780
Oh. Well, my daddy was right.
It's beautiful here.

1707
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,362
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1708
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,780
You think I should try to rent a
barrel and try to shoot the falls?

1709
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,420
PEARL: I think we should
just look at them, maybe.

1710
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,980
- Yeah.
- TAMMY: Really?

1711
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,260
I don't know. I got a good feeling.

1712
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,660
I feel like I've been
thinking about a course...

1713
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,700
and if I just shoot out into
the middle soft spot there...

1714
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:00,260
it'll probably just pillow-carry me right
over that Canadian lagoon over there.

1715
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:04,048
I think if anyone could
do it, it would be you.

1716

TAMMY: Oh! Oh.

1717
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,700
I thought I saw the Cheetos.
It's not them.

You guys wanna get Cheetos?

1719

- Hey, man. How you doing?
- MAN: Hey. Good.

1720
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,820
- What can I get for you?
- I'm gonna have the iced tea...

1721
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,527
and then the full rack
of the pork ribs.

1722
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,220
The full rack,
that's a lot of sodium.

1723
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,980
You wanna think about going half?

1724
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,300
Oh. Uh, no, I'm gonna
get the full rack.

1725
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,700
I'm gonna say no.

1726
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,500
I'm gonna say let's, together,
make a better choice.

1727
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,780
How about salmon? Give you a little cup
of BBQ sauce on the side to spice it up.

1728
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:47,900
- Better choice, still got zip.
- I'm just gonna do the ribs.

How's your cholesterol?

01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:54,260
- It's a concern. It's up there, but...
- Oh, Jesus.

1731
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,180
- I'm gonna take away the barbecue sauce.
- MAN: Oh, man.

All right? Poom.
You're gonna thank me later.

1733
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:03,260
- I'm gonna fill that up for you.
- Can I...?

1734
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,660
I can't believe you're
leaving me for that dick.

1735

three goddamn years. What are you gonna do?
