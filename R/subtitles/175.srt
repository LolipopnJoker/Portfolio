1
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,628
Oh, this is great.

2
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,796
Wow!

3
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,964
That's incredible.

4
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,467
There's got to be
7 or 8 feet up there.

5
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,469
And 80 years of dust.

6
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,388
Look at all this height.

7
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,889
With our bedroom upstairs,

8
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,307
we'd have all this space.

9
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,600
For what?

10
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,310
Just space.

11
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,272
1 ...

12
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,940
2...

13
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,191
3!

14
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,861
And 4?

15
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,781
And 5?

16
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,702
Watch it. Watch it.

17
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,204
God, this place
is huge.

18
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,539
Wow.

19
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,333
It's beautiful.

20
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,960
God!

21
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,504
You guys, it's
absolutely incredible.

22
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,214
Incredible.

23
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,217
A little paint,
you could sell this tomorrow

24
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,677
and double your money.

25
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,013
Carl, you're obsessed.

26
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,848
A little bit.

27
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,183
Whoa, look!

28
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,812
Hey, it's
an Indian head penny.

29
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,480
1 898.

30
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,568
It's a good omen.

31
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,571
You're the good omen.

32
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,869
Oh, it's so great.

33
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,340
I had Rose
move your 3:00 to 4:00.

34
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,342
Gary Allen called
late yesterday.

35
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,843
He has to see you

36
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,346
about the final painting bids
for the loft.

37
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,848
3:00 is the only time
he can make it.

38
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,518
Sam?

39
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,105
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

40
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,108
Relax. This isn't brain surgery
you're going into.

41
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,111
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

42
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,905
Sam...

43
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
you're going
to be great, OK?

44
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,910
What am I
supposed to say?

45
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,203
I can't tell them

46
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,914
my Swedish pompom girl joke,
you know.

47
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,416
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,918
Nice, huh? Molly.

49
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,420
What do you think?
Are they me?

50
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,422
Man, look at that.
A Testarossa.

51
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,423
Whoa.

52
00:04:58,507 --> 00:04:59,424
Ouch.

53
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,176
Pay off
your Mustang first.

54
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,021
How are you feeling?

55
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,523
What did
the doctor say?

56
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,525
He said
it was contagious,

57
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,026
that it was really...

58
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,194
No.

59
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,698
He said I shouldn't
be coming in today.

60
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,241
What about the rash?

61
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,702
The rash?

62
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,870
Mm-hmm.

63
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,371
The rash is, um...

64
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,873
also incredibly
contagious.

65
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,875
He said they've
both been spreading.

66
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,209
No.

67
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,590
On your genitals
again?

68
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,757
Yeah.

69
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,759
Yeah, right on
the genitals.

70
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,386
Basically everywhere.

71
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,889
He said that I
shouldn't touch anyone.

72
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,641
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,646
You're sick.

74
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,647
I know.

75
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,648
Morning, Paul.

76
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,150
Morning,
Carl, Sam.

77
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,318
Hey, Paul.

78
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,819
Morning, Mr. Wheat.

79
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,279
Morning, Susan.
You're looking good.

80
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,447
Sam?

81
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,032
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,327
Here it is.

83
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,494
Thanks.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,915
Morning, Sam.

85
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,917
Morning. Listen,
the Kobiashi people--

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,835
They're already here.

87
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,128
They're early.

88
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,296
I know.

89
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,341
Come here. How long
have they been here?

90
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,842
About 10 minutes.

91
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,344
Andy Dillon called

92
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,847
and says he needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by 1 0:00.

93
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,973
By 1 0:00?

94
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,225
Yes.

95
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,353
Carl?

96
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,687
Yeah?

97
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,984
Dillon needs 900,000
in Albany by 1 0:00.

98
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,987
Can you transfer it
to his payroll account?

99
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,989
I'll need your Mac code.

100
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,157
OK.

101
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,997
Discretion, right?

102
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,165
Got it.

103
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,001
You bet.
I'll do it right now.

104
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,170
Bill, I'll call you back.

105
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,558
OK, OK, that's fine.
That's fine.

106
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,809
That's fine!

107
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,437
Aw, man,
it's too far out.

108
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,983
Can you
get this, man?

109
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,985
Where
are you guys from,

110
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,987
the New York City Ballet?

111
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,659
Almost.

112
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,164
Oh!

113
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,665
Saved your life!

114
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,708
You shit.

115
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,126
You scared me to death.

116
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,627
Why'd you do that?

117
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,130
It's better than seeing
this gorgeous body

118
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,631
splattered
all over the place.

119
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,966
Look out.

120
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,641
Sam? Molly?
You guys home?

121
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,143
Did you invite Carl?

122
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,144
Slave labor.

123
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,145
-Carl?
-What?

124
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,146
Hurry. Help.

125
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,647
Oh, my God.

126
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,399
Grab the bottom.

127
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,901
Want this down here?

128
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,736
Right here?

129
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,237
Watch your toes.

130
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,364
Where do you want this?

131
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,408
Uh, in the bedroom.

132
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,787
God, this place
looks great.

133
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,955
Yeah.

134
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,457
You like it, huh?

135
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,459
Like is hardly
the word.

136
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,961
I didn't know it would be
this beautiful.

137
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,463
Molly, what about her?

138
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,466
Leave her there
until we get the rest in.

139
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,967
What are these?

140
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,969
Oh, let me show you.

141
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,971
Help me
lift this up.

142
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:33,972
Here?

143
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:34,973
Voila!

144
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:35,974
Wow.

145
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,518
What do you think?

146
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,520
It's fantastic.
I love it.

147
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,232
Sam, what's
this chair doing here?

148
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,734
What do you mean?
I love that chair.

149
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,028
I know, but we
discussed this...

150
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,530
I've had it forever.

151
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,533
When I watch TV,
I sit in it.

152
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,034
This chair is ugly.

153
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,035
So?

154
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,037
And it doesn't go
with anything.

155
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,539
It goes with me.

156
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,040
You're right.
It does.

157
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,293
We'll paint it.

158
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,753
We'll what?

159
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,264
Are you OK?

160
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,766
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

161
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,522
What's the matter?

162
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,982
Nothing.

163
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,946
You worried
about the promotion?

164
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,908
No, not really.

165
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:45,669
Then what?

166
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,629
Is it moving in
together?

167
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,339
No.

168
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,970
I don't know.
It's...

169
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,847
a lot of things.

170
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,896
I just don't want
the bubble to burst.

171
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,691
Seems like, uh...

172
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,738
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

173
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,949
I'm just afraid
I'm going to lose it.

174
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,873
I love you.

175
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,917
I really love you.

176
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,713
Ditto.

177
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,092
The pilot
first reported trouble

178
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,094
when the number two
engine blew,

179
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,598
the one in the tail
of the plane...

180
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,934
Oh, Jesus,
another one?

181
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,562
Oh, don't watch that.

182
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,775
I should cancel
my L. A. trip.

183
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,945
These things always
happen in threes.

184
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,072
Sam, get serious.

185
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,574
Besides, you lead
a charmed life.

186
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,660
Oh, yeah?
So did they.

187
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,579
It's amazing.

188
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,164
Just like that.

189
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,499
Blackout.

190
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,639
Oh

191
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:07,352
My love

192
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,814
My darling

193
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,233
I've hungered for...

194
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,776
What are you doing?

195
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,821
I couldn't sleep.

196
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,824
A long

197
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,993
Lonely time

198
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,037
I must
have passed out.

199
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,289
What time is it?

200
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,790
It's 2 a.m.

201
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,419
And time

202
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,256
Goes by

203
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,676
So slowly

204
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,679
Any time

205
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,683
Can do so much

206
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,646
Are you

207
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,940
Still mine

208
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,025
Oh, no.

209
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,194
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

210
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,904
It's not now.

211
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,241
Can I help?

212
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,408
Yeah.

213
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,411
Put your hands here
and get them wet.

214
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,668
Just let the clay
slide between your fingers.

215
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,421
God speed your love

216
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:21,844
To me

217
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,435
Lonely rivers Flow

218
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,354
To the sea

219
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,606
To the sea

220
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,734
To the open arms

221
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,987
Of the sea

222
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,947
Yeah

223
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,117
Lonely rivers sigh

224
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,785
Wait for me

225
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,163
Wait for me

226
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,291
I'll be coming home

227
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,503
Wait for me

228
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,006
Oh

229
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:03,760
My love

230
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:07,389
My darling

231
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,516
I've hungered

232
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,813
Hungered for your touch

233
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,858
A long

234
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,695
Lonely time

235
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,286
And time

236
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,831
Goes by

237
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,668
So slowly

238
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,712
Any time

239
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:43,300
Can do so much

240
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,179
Are you

241
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:53,435
Still mine

242
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,398
I need

243
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:02,027
Your love

244
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,239
I

245
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:09,076
I need your love

246
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,038
God speed your love

247
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,503
To me

248
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,009
Oh, no.

249
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:09,970
What's the matter?

250
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:12,973
A glitch.
What's up?

251
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,976
The Greenberg and White accounts--
I can't get in.

252
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,311
The Mac code
isn't working.

253
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,645
Oh, I changed it.

254
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,646
Why?

255
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,357
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

256
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,859
Is something wrong?

257
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,737
Can you keep a secret?

258
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,407
Yeah, sure.

259
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,742
What's up?

260
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,244
There's too much money
in these accounts.

261
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,288
Too much money?
That's impossible.

262
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,880
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

263
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,381
Let me do this.

264
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,883
It's already
taken me hours.

265
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,384
Let me figure it out.

266
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,886
No, that's OK.

267
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,888
It's like
a vendetta now.

268
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,890
Thanks, though.
I appreciate it.

269
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,058
OK.

270
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,061
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

271
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,647
OK. Adios.

272
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,067
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

273
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,070
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

274
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,197
She likes
the guys in tights.

275
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,698
You want to go?

276
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:12,866
No, thanks.

277
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,576
I want a full
report, though.

278
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,744
Later.

279
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:16,912
Yeah.

280
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,877
Well, I loved it.

281
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,380
I was spellbound
the whole time.

282
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,881
I could tell.

283
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,383
So could
everyone else

284
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,052
with that resonating
snore of yours.

285
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,560
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

286
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,061
Yeah, about six times.

287
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,563
It wasn't six times.

288
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,065
Quit being
so blase about this.

289
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,567
This is really
important.

290
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,069
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

291
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:53,073
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

292
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,575
Molly,
The New York Times

293
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,577
is just some
frustrated little critic

294
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:00,080
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

295
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,498
Who cares what they think?

296
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,001
About eight million
readers, that's who.

297
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,921
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

298
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:09,923
Your work
is really beautiful.

299
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,425
It really is.

300
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,551
Thanks.

301
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,095
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

302
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,597
just what I think.

303
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,021
I want
to marry you, Sam.

304
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,355
What?

305
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,733
What?

306
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,401
Yep.

307
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,778
I've been
thinking about it.

308
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,281
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

309
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,576
and I think we
should just do it.

310
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,411
You're serious.

311
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,954
Yeah.

312
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,418
What's that look for?

313
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,384
You never wanted
to talk about it.

314
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,063
Do you love me, Sam?

315
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,233
Well, what do you think?

316
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,235
Why don't you
ever say it?

317
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,738
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

318
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,240
No, you say ""ditto,""

319
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,492
and that's
not the same.

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,080
People say I love you
all the time,

321
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,541
and it doesn't
mean anything.

322
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,129
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

323
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,299
I need to hear it.

324
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,052
Let's go.

325
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,020
What should we do?

326
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,522
Let me handle it.

327
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,023
What do you want?

328
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,025
Your wallet--
give it to me!

329
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,237
Sam, just give it to him.

330
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,867
OK, just take the money.
Just leave--

331
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,660
No, Sam--

332
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,662
You son of a bitch!

333
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,666
Sam, don't!

334
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,419
Somebody help us!

335
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,588
Jesus Christ, Sam!

336
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,424
Just get off him.

337
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,259
Somebody!

338
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:19,219
Somebody help us!

339
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,054
Sam, just let...

340
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,099
Sam, stop it.

341
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,601
Stop it, Sam!

342
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,080
Molly?

343
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,043
Molly, he got--

344
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,009
Sam...

345
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,766
Baby, hold on.

346
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,809
You're going
to be OK.

347
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,271
Somebody?

348
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,106
Somebody?

349
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,025
Somebody help us!

350
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,443
Oh, Sam.

351
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,863
Oh, my God.

352
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,865
Oh, Sam, come on.

353
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,450
Hold on, baby.

354
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,911
Someone's going to come.

355
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,580
You're going to be OK.

356
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,133
Somebody!

357
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,845
Somebody help me!

358
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,013
Please, anybody!

359
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,099
Help me. Please help me.

360
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,142
Take it easy, all right?

361
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,104
We'll help you, OK?

362
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,773
Molly? Molly?

363
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,024
Molly?

364
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:00,362
OK.

365
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,780
All right.
All right.

366
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:03,115
Molly?

367
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,616
What should we do?

368
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,784
Aah!

369
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,037
Aah!

370
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:12,374
Aah!

371
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,836
What's happening?

372
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,505
What's...

373
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:19,882
Is he breathing?

374
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,762
I don't know
if he's breathing.

375
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,349
Don't die, Sam.
Hold on.

376
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,518
Hold on, baby.
Hold on.

377
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,020
Oh, my God.

378
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,580
Come on, man.

379
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,040
All right.

380
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,375
Here we go.

381
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,169
1 ...

382
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,129
Come on, baby.

383
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,757
Sam, don't you leave me.

384
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,383
Sam, hold on!

385
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,761
Sam...

386
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,095
Oh, Sam...

387
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,599
Jesus...

388
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,315
Miss Jensen, if you'll just step
this way, please.

389
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,002
So, what happened
to you?

390
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,171
What?

391
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,131
You're new, huh?
I could tell.

392
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,300
Are you talking to me?

393
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:27,801
Relax. It ain't
like before.

394
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,846
It's a whole new
ball of wax.

395
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,806
Who are you?

396
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,808
I'm waiting
for my wife.

397
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,811
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

398
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,238
Shot, huh?

399
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,740
That'll do it every time.

400
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,367
Poor bastard.

401
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,037
You may as well
get used to it.

402
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,539
You could be here
for a long while.

403
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,213
Come here.
I'll tell you a secret.

404
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,756
Doors ain't so bad.

405
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,758
Zip, zap--
they ain't nothing.

406
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,760
You'll see.
You'll catch on.

407
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,221
This patient's fibrillating.
Let's move it.

408
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,681
Give me
the paddles.

409
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,683
He ain't
going to make it.

410
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,769
I've seen it
a million times.

411
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,270
He's a goner.

412
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,772
He's still
fibrillating.

413
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:22,940
Clear.

414
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:26,860
You see?

415
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,362
Here they come.

416
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,909
Lucky bastard.

417
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,912
It could have been
the other ones.

418
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,248
You never know.

419
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,602
Who are--

420
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,776
No!

421
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:14,992
Aah!

422
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,493
God help me.

423
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,872
Oh, God...

424
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,373
help me.

425
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,507
""I am sunk
in the abysmal swamp

426
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,509
where there is no foothold.

427
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:35,387
I have reached
the watery depths.

428
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:38,432
The flood overwhelms me.

429
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:41,894
I am wearied with calling.''

430
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:45,564
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam Wheat,

431
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,066
we are reminded
of his kindness...

432
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,112
his generosity,

433
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,240
his buoyancy of spirit.

434
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,909
All that we treasure--

435
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,411
our loved ones,

436
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,829
our friends,

437
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,956
our body,

438
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,751
our mind--

439
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,253
are but on loan to us.

440
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:11,381
We must
surrender them all.

441
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,384
We are all travelers
on the same road,

442
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,929
which leads
to the same end.

443
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,061
As our loved one
enters eternal life,

444
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,730
let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

445
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,984
That although
we will miss him,

446
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,111
our love
will light the void

447
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,113
and dispel the darkness.

448
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,114
I picked up
your shirts today.

449
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:20,367
I don't know why.

450
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,167
Mr. Reynolds told me
to tell you hello.

451
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,172
I broke into tears.

452
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,344
It's like I think
about you every minute.

453
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,639
It's like
I can still feel you.

454
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,526
I'm here, Moll.

455
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,995
Floyd, what's
the matter, kitty?

456
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,580
What's the matter?

457
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,625
Crazy cat.

458
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,422
Sam?

459
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,177
That's really
stupid.

460
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,898
I love this picture.

461
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,899
It's great.

462
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:37,069
Office.

463
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:47,538
Let me see that.

464
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:48,539
It's, um...

465
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,040
Sam's address book.

466
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,124
Right.

467
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,590
Dave Brubeck.
Newport, '88.

468
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,092
Should I toss
them?

469
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,093
No.

470
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:05,180
No? Molly, we hated
that concert.

471
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,181
Hey.

472
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:09,393
Oh. You wanted
to save those?

473
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:10,936
Rolaids?

474
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,689
Molly, what
are you doing?

475
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:25,117
I just miss him,
Carl.

476
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,618
Me, too.

477
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,581
Carl?

478
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,582
Yeah?

479
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,083
Wait a minute.
Wait.

480
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,084
What?

481
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,586
Not that one.

482
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,087
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

483
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:39,590
I didn't mean to put
that on there.

484
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,091
That's OK.

485
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,635
Hey, Moll,
why don't you come?

486
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,137
It's like summer
outside.

487
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,557
No, I'm really
not up for it.

488
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,517
Just for a walk.

489
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,019
I don't want to.

490
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,229
You can't stay in
all day.

491
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,564
It's not healthy.

492
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,649
Carl, I can't do it!

493
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:00,694
Molly, you're not
the one who died.

494
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,781
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,283
Don't apologize.

496
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,660
Shit.

497
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:13,999
Maybe you're right.

498
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,751
Maybe
just a short one.

499
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,836
That a girl.

500
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,215
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,509
Don't worry about it.

502
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:24,927
Molly!

503
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:27,156
What are you
doing here?

504
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,658
You bastard.

505
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:34,913
You son of a bitch!

506
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,890
What do you want?

507
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,601
-Molly?

508
00:32:56,768 --> 00:32:59,563
Molly, get out!

509
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,856
Oh, my God.

510
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,906
No, Molly! Look,
no, no, please!

511
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,075
Molly!

512
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,452
Molly,
he's got a gun!

513
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,830
Hi, kitty. Hi.

514
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:19,124
You hurt her--

515
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,067
Aah!

516
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,485
Shit!

517
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:50,656
Is somebody there?

518
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,283
Hello?

519
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,078
Hello?

520
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,446
Oh, my God!

521
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:16,074
Let go!
What are you doing?

522
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:18,911
Aah!

523
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,165
Like trains?

524
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,886
Stay out! This is mine!

525
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,798
Shit.

526
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:07,603
It's me.
I couldn't get it.

527
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,105
She came home.

528
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,608
Give me a couple
of days, man.

529
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,193
I'll go back.

530
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,944
Relax.

531
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,446
I'll get it.

532
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,407
Get what?

533
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,369
Who are you?

534
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,872
What do you
want from us?

535
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,878
No.

536
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,840
You stay away
from her.

537
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,342
Do you hear me?

538
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:41,678
Stay away from her!

539
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:06,203
And...

540
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,997
teddy bear, teddy bear,
turn around,

541
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,415
teddy bear,
teddy bear,

542
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,376
touch
the ground.

543
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,950
Rosa Santiago?

544
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,374
Please
be seated.

545
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:11,268
Our sister will be
with us soon.

546
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:16,148
Sister Oda Mae,

547
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:20,235
grant us the gift of
your all-seeing presence.

548
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,988
Appear before us
now.

549
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:30,746
Mrs. Santiago?

550
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,789
Buenos dias.

551
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,250
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

552
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,794
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

553
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:38,795
Si.

554
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,256
I believe
he'll be with us today.

555
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,508
Thank you.

556
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:43,509
Thank you.

557
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,677
But you know,
Mrs. Santiago,

558
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:48,680
there's no telling
about that other world,

559
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:51,767
so you've got to be
a believer, Mrs. Santiago.

560
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,310
Are you a believer?

561
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,813
Si. Si, I believe.
I believe.

562
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:58,315
Then let us begin.

563
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,255
I can't.

564
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,299
I can't.
It's too difficult.

565
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:27,845
I can't make contact.
I don't feel his vi--

566
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,304
No, wait!

567
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,223
I'm feeling something.

568
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:36,645
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

569
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,898
Consuelo?

570
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:42,109
Lucita?

571
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:43,485
Julietta?

572
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:45,154
Josefina? Linda?

573
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:46,196
Maria?

574
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,991
I Si! His mama!

575
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,492
She is Maria!

576
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:54,830
Yes! Praise God, I knew
he was with his mama.

577
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:56,540
Oh, my God.

578
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,755
It's too difficult.
It's two of them.

579
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,258
I'm not sure
I can do that.

580
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,718
It's so trying.

581
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,179
Oh, I pay more.
How much?

582
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,180
How much?

583
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,181
$20.

584
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,184
Way to go. Milk her
for every penny.

585
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:36,330
Huh. Yes, I...I believe
we can start again.

586
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,386
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

587
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:55,349
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you, Jesus.

588
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,157
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.

589
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:16,286
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.

590
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,454
My husband?

591
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:18,789
Have mercy!

592
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:20,332
Oh, yeah? Where?

593
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,294
Julio?

594
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,963
Yes!

595
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,841
I feel his vibration.

596
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,592
Ooh!

597
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,971
I see him!

598
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:36,932
How is he?
How does he look?

599
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,308
Oh, he's a handsome man.

600
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,395
Handsome?

601
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:44,857
Mrs. Santiago,
in Our Father's kingdom,

602
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,733
we're all handsome.

603
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,444
Oh, Julio.

604
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,071
Julio's
coming towards us.

605
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:53,907
I see him! He's coming!

606
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:55,492
He's there!

607
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:01,248
He's dressed
in a black suit.

608
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,168
Black suit?

609
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:07,629
It could be blue.

610
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:10,382
What a crock of shit.

611
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:11,884
Who is that?

612
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,802
Julio! Where are you?

613
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:14,803
Julio? Julio?

614
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,638
Did you hear it?

615
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,348
Damn!
Where are you?

616
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:19,391
Julio?

617
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:20,726
Who are you?

618
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:22,728
Whoa!

619
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,146
You can hear me?

620
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,356
Don't you hear him?

621
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,858
I don't believe this.

622
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,943
Hey, you,
my name's Sam Wheat.

623
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:33,030
Can you hear me?
Sam Wheat. Say my name.

624
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,448
Leave me alone!

625
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:35,782
Say it! Sam Wheat!

626
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:38,368
Talk to me, Oda Mae.
Say something!

627
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,745
Sam Wheat!

628
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,790
Jesus.

629
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,751
- Sam Wheat?
- Sam Wheat?

630
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,252
I swear,
no more cheating.

631
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,254
I'll do anything.
I'll do penance,

632
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,256
but make that guy
go away!

633
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,257
No way.

634
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,258
Aah!

635
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,475
It's OK.

636
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,561
It's OK.

637
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,940
All right, sister.

638
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:09,608
Thank you.

639
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,860
Yeah, you're
all right.

640
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,862
My mother
and my mother's mother

641
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:15,364
both had the gift.

642
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,867
They always said I had it,
but I never did.

643
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,369
I never had it.

644
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:22,371
They told me
all about it.

645
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:26,375
But now that I got it,
I don't think I want it.

646
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,876
Go away.
Find somebody else.

647
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,587
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

648
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,130
I'm getting there fast.

649
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,591
She hit her head
harder than we think.

650
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:37,845
She was talking to nobody
before she hit her head.

651
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:39,346
Sister can do that.

652
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:40,931
Where exactly are you?

653
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,432
Standing
right beside you.

654
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:45,352
Oh, you're standing
right beside me?

655
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:47,563
Well, honey,
we're right here.

656
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,064
Are you white?

657
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:50,107
What?

658
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,108
White?

659
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:52,609
You're white,
aren't you?

660
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,111
Know what I think?

661
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,946
I'll call the doctor
right now.

662
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:58,407
I knew it.
A white guy. Why me?

663
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:00,909
Listen, damn it.
You're going to help me.

664
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,828
There's a woman
named Molly Jensen.

665
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,329
She's in terrible danger.

666
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,040
The man who killed me
broke into our apartment,

667
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:09,042
and he's going
to go back.

668
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:10,544
You've got
to warn her.

669
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,589
What makes you think
she'll listen to me?

670
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:15,591
It's just a phone call.

671
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,552
Look...

672
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:22,764
you're all I've got.

673
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,934
Now, I'm not leaving
until you help me.

674
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:28,937
I don't care
how long it takes,

675
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:30,939
'cause I can talk
forever.

676
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:45,496
Hello?

677
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:47,498
Uh, hi. Is this
Molly Jensen?

678
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:48,499
Yes.

679
00:45:48,582 --> 00:45:50,000
My name's
Oda Mae Brown.

680
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:52,002
I'm a spiritual reader
and advisor.

681
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,214
A friend of yours gave me
a message for you.

682
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:57,716
I know this sounds crazy,
but it's not.

683
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,719
You got to believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

684
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,804
Who is this?

685
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:05,682
I got a message
from Sam.

686
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,893
What?

687
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,146
Sam Wheat?
He asked me to call.

688
00:46:12,189 --> 00:46:13,649
I told you.

689
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:14,650
Go there.

690
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,652
Forget it.
I'm not going anywhere.

691
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:19,571
I don't care
what you do.

692
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,824
Second verse
Same as the first

693
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:24,076
I'm 'En-er-y the Eighth
I am

694
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,411
'En-er-y the Eighth
I am, I am

695
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:28,997
I got married
to the widow next door

696
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:31,542
She's been married
seven times before

697
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,293
And every one
was an 'En-er-y

698
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,795
'En-er-y

699
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:35,838
Wouldn't have
a Willy or a Sam

700
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,214
No, sir

701
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:39,675
I'm her eighth old man
I'm 'En-er-y

702
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:42,469
'En-er-y the Eighth
I am, I am

703
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:44,638
'En-er-y the Eighth
I am

704
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,224
Second verse
Same as the first

705
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,810
I'm 'En-er-y the Eighth
I am

706
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:52,437
'En-er-y the Eighth
I am, I am

707
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:55,232
I got married
to the widow next door--

708
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:57,234
All right! All right!
Stop singing!

709
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,153
I'll go anywhere
you want to,

710
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,613
just don't sing anymore.

711
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,118
I can't believe this.

712
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:08,620
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

713
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:10,622
What am I doing
down here?

714
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:13,125
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.

715
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,127
She's probably
not even there.

716
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,795
Where are you?

717
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:17,880
Oh.

718
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,548
Woof.

719
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,633
Which building is it?

720
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,136
Uh, push 3.

721
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,306
See? Nobody's there.

722
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:28,807
She's there.
Just wait.

723
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:31,310
I did everything
I said I'd do.

724
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:32,811
I pressed
the button.

725
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,479
She's not there.
I'm going.

726
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:36,023
99 bottles of beer
on the wall

727
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:37,191
99 bottles of beer

728
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:38,609
Take one down
Pass it around--

729
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,444
Don't sing, all right?

730
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:41,445
Hello?

731
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:42,946
Molly--

732
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,448
Shh! She can't hear you.

733
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:45,949
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.

734
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,952
I called you about
your friend Sam Wheat?

735
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,955
I told you.

736
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,964
Hey, Molly!
Molly Jensen.

737
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,926
I know you're up there.
I know you hear me.

738
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:06,428
I'm down here.
Sam wants to talk to you.

739
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,472
This is for real.

740
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:10,474
Remember the starfish
in Montego Bay?

741
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:13,810
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

742
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:16,313
Hey, Molly, I know
about the green underwear

743
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:18,315
that you wrote
your name on.

744
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,610
I'd never get over that,
I tell you that.

745
00:48:21,652 --> 00:48:24,613
I know about
the picture in Reno.

746
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:26,198
Hey, Molly!

747
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:29,701
Ask her about the sweater
she knitted in the closet

748
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,203
that's too big.

749
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:35,707
He asked me to remind you
of the sweater in the closet

750
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,626
that you knitted
that's too big.

751
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,837
Four sizes.

752
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,674
Hey, you hear me
talking to you?

753
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:45,175
I hear you.

754
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,969
Shut up. Nobody's
talking to you.

755
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:48,470
Ever hear of a phone?

756
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,264
Want to kiss my butt?

757
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,766
I'm not staying
down here all day.

758
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,767
Thank God.

759
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:55,269
Aw, man, shut up.

760
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:57,771
Molly! I'm going
to count to 3,

761
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,232
and I'm out of here.

762
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:01,692
1 , 2, 3.

763
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:05,028
No, Oda, wait.

764
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:06,029
No.

765
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:07,406
It's Molly.

766
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:15,664
Molly?

767
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,669
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

768
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,550
I don't know you or Sam,

769
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,052
but let me tell you
what he did.

770
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,054
He kept me up all night

771
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:32,890
singing I'm Henry
The Eighth, I Am.

772
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:36,602
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

773
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:37,978
Look, I'm sorry.

774
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,980
I just--
I just don't believe

775
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:43,233
in this life
after death stuff.

776
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,735
Well, tell her
she's wrong.

777
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,237
He says
you're wrong.

778
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,239
You're talking to him
right now?

779
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:52,618
He just asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

780
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,119
So where is he?

781
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:57,706
I can't see him.
I can only hear him.

782
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:00,167
I'm right here.

783
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,503
That doesn't help,
Sam.

784
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:05,631
I'm holding
her hand.

785
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,925
He says he's
holding your hand.

786
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:19,311
What are you doing?

787
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:23,106
What do you think
you're doing to me?

788
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,568
If you think I'm here for
my health, you're crazy.

789
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:29,530
Sam's dead, OK?
He's dead.

790
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:31,532
Tell her
I love her.

791
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:33,575
He says
he loves you.

792
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,663
Sam would
never say that.

793
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:38,664
Say ditto.

794
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,165
What the hell
is ditto?

795
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:41,458
Ditto!

796
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:12,489
To tell you
the truth,

797
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,992
I don't know how
I'm doing this.

798
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,493
Confidentially,
nothing like this

799
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:18,495
has ever happened
to me before.

800
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:19,997
I mean, nothing.

801
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,999
Now I can't
turn it off.

802
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,336
Is this him?
Is this you?

803
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:27,337
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

804
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:29,173
Huh. Cute.

805
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:30,924
White,
but cute.

806
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:33,343
What I don't
understand is,

807
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:35,179
why did he come back?

808
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,680
I don't know.

809
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:38,182
Why is he
still here?

810
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,184
He's stuck,
that's what it is.

811
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:41,685
He's in between
worlds.

812
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,228
You know,
it happens sometimes

813
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,731
that the spirit gets
yanked out so quick

814
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,191
that the essence
still feels

815
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,734
it has work to do.

816
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:50,110
Would you stop rambling?

817
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,612
I'm just answering
her question.

818
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,113
He's got
an attitude now.

819
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:55,240
I don't have an attitude.

820
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:57,242
Yes, you do
have an attitude.

821
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:58,702
We're having
a little discussion.

822
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,746
If you didn't have
a attitude,

823
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:02,581
you wouldn't have
raised your voice.

824
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,082
God damn it,
Oda Mae--

825
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,584
Don't you god damn me.

826
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,961
Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.

827
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,296
Would you relax?

828
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,298
You relax.
You're the dead guy.

829
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,300
Want me to help?
You apologize.

830
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:14,301
Jesus Christ!

831
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:15,511
I'm leaving.

832
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:17,971
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

833
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:19,473
Now, you better
apologize.

834
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:20,974
I'm sorry.

835
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:21,975
I apologize.

836
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:23,519
OK?

837
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:26,396
Now, would you
sit down?

838
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,397
Please?

839
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,691
He's apologized.

840
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:33,779
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

841
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:36,782
but you have to tell her
word for word.

842
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:40,285
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

843
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,579
word for word.

844
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,836
Molly, you're in danger.

845
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:51,839
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

846
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,590
And quit moving around,
will you?

847
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,133
You're making me dizzy.

848
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,719
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

849
00:52:57,803 --> 00:53:01,431
Molly, you in danger,
girl.

850
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,433
What are you
talking about?

851
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,644
I know the man
who killed me.

852
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:07,187
He knows
who killed him.

853
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,982
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

854
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,984
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

855
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,443
He knows
where he lives.

856
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:14,444
Write it down.

857
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:15,946
You write it down.

858
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:17,447
I ain't no
damn secretary.

859
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:18,490
Just do it!

860
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:19,992
Argh!

861
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,411
He's so testy.

862
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:25,455
What is it you
want me to write?

863
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,333
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

864
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:29,835
303 Prospect Place?

865
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:30,836
Yeah.

866
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,005
That's my
neighborhood.

867
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:35,007
Molly, he's got
my wallet,

868
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,508
he's got my key,

869
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,010
and he was
in here.

870
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:41,346
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

871
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,348
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

872
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:45,851
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes--

873
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,352
All right,
all right.

874
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:49,730
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

875
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,773
he saw
everything.

876
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:54,276
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

877
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:56,320
I was murdered.

878
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:59,364
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

879
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:00,908
There's somebody
else involved--

880
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,827
I don't want no more
to do with this.

881
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:05,329
Where are you going?

882
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,332
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

883
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,501
And don't be
following me.

884
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,503
I'm finished.
I mean it.

885
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:15,005
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

886
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,089
Goodbye.

887
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:21,136
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

888
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,431
who wants this
to be true more than me,

889
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:26,850
but you got to be
rational about this.

890
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:30,062
Sam is no more
in this room than--

891
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:35,734
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

892
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:38,779
I really do,
but this is absurd.

893
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:42,908
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

894
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:44,910
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

895
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:47,037
who shows up
at your door?

896
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:50,040
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

897
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:52,251
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

898
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:54,628
What about the things
she knew?

899
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:56,255
What things?

900
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:00,259
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

901
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:02,094
Carl, we were alone.

902
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:05,556
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

903
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:11,311
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

904
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:14,731
Yeah, that he
was set up.

905
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:16,775
This is getting
deranged.

906
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:18,277
We're off
the deep end.

907
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,571
She had a name
and an address--

908
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:21,572
Willy Lopez.

909
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,116
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

910
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,910
This is sick.

911
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:28,453
Oh, Carl.

912
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,497
This is really sick.

913
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:32,624
Oh, God.

914
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,126
Molly, I don't
understand

915
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:36,128
how you could--
you could...

916
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,632
swallow this crap.
I mean...

917
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:43,135
this guy
may not even exist.

918
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:46,138
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

919
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:48,807
to set someone up.

920
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:50,893
You're right.

921
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,436
You're absolutely right.

922
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:55,439
That's what
I got to find out.

923
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:57,941
What do you mean,
find out?

924
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:01,320
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

925
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,822
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

926
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:06,658
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

927
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,161
What are you going
to tell the police?

928
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:10,662
That some
storefront psychic

929
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,165
has been communing
with the dead?

930
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,667
Do you know what
that sounds like?

931
00:56:15,751 --> 00:56:18,170
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

932
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:20,797
I'm sorry.

933
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:23,634
This stuff just really
gets to me,

934
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:24,635
you know?

935
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,137
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

936
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,639
I'm trying to, Molly.

937
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:33,811
Look...

938
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,855
if it'll make you
feel any better,

939
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:41,151
I'll go check
this out, OK?

940
00:56:41,193 --> 00:56:44,154
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

941
00:56:44,196 --> 00:56:45,155
OK?

942
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:47,074
All right.

943
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,160
I'll call you
in the morning.

944
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:51,161
OK.

945
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,482
Be careful.

946
00:57:34,246 --> 00:57:35,205
Carl.

947
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:38,208
What the hell
are you doing here?

948
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,420
Who you been
talking to, Willy?

949
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:43,922
""Talking to""?
What the hell do you mean?

950
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:46,258
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

951
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,260
Where's she
getting it from?

952
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,762
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

953
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,265
She knows your name
and where you live.

954
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:55,726
A lot of women
know where I live.

955
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:57,728
This is not a joke.

956
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,730
She knows
about the murder.

957
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:02,357
I want you
to find this bitch,

958
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,859
whoever she is,

959
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,861
and I want you to--

960
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:10,157
Just get rid
of her, OK?

961
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,661
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

962
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:17,164
If I don't get
those codes,

963
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:20,167
if that money is not
transferred soon...

964
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:24,463
I'm...

965
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:25,506
dead.

966
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:27,049
We're both dead.

967
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,510
Why not tell them
you only launder money

968
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,969
the first of the month?

969
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,846
What the hell
is wrong with you?

970
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,474
Is everything a joke?

971
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:37,226
You killed a man.

972
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:38,393
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

973
00:58:38,477 --> 00:58:40,854
-Was that a joke?
-I did you a favor.

974
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,356
That was a freebie.

975
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:46,652
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

976
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:49,196
Just don't blow this
for me.

977
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:52,115
I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

978
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:55,452
$80,000 of that money
is mine.

979
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:00,040
Look, just...

980
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:02,876
let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

981
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:05,629
I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

982
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,782
You god damn bastard!

983
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:34,908
Why?

984
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:37,536
Why? You were
my friend!

985
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:42,291
I had a life,
god damn you.

986
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,042
I had a life!

987
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:56,346
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

988
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,848
But she was real.

989
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:01,685
You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

990
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:03,896
You know,

991
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:07,357
you told me if I had
any new information

992
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:08,859
that I should come.

993
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,360
So here I am.

994
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,450
I know
how this sounds.

995
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:18,452
I hear myself
saying it,

996
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:20,454
and I want
to cringe.

997
01:00:20,496 --> 01:00:23,457
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

998
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,959
Things Sam
only said to me.

999
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:29,129
OK, according to this
psychic lady,

1000
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:33,634
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place

1001
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,636
watching us
all the time?

1002
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:36,637
Huh?

1003
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:42,309
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

1004
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:43,310
Excuse me.

1005
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:46,313
I got more
important things to do.

1006
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:59,493
The guy's name
is Willy Lopez.

1007
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:02,996
All I'm asking you to do
is check it out.

1008
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,498
OK. Wait here.

1009
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:08,293
Let me see if the guy's
got a record, all right?

1010
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:10,087
Great.

1011
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:14,484
What are you doing?

1012
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,653
Where's the file
on Willy Lopez?

1013
01:02:16,736 --> 01:02:18,154
There isn't one.

1014
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,156
He was probably
some old boyfriend

1015
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,659
she was trying
to get even with.

1016
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:24,661
This psychic woman's
got a record

1017
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:27,163
that goes back
a long way.

1018
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:28,164
1967,

1019
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:29,874
Shreveport,

1020
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,042
forgery...

1021
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:33,628
selling false I.D.

1022
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,339
Served one year, 1971 .

1023
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:39,259
Baton Rouge,
arrested for fraud.

1024
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:43,513
Numbers racketeering,
served 10 months, 1974.

1025
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:45,098
Look,
this is impossible.

1026
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:47,434
It goes on and on.

1027
01:02:47,517 --> 01:02:49,436
She knew things,
private things.

1028
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:52,063
Now, how could she
have known all that?

1029
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:54,566
A lot of times
they read the obits.

1030
01:02:54,607 --> 01:02:57,944
She just had to see
the word ""banker""--boom.

1031
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:00,447
Hell, they even go
through your...garbage

1032
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,657
to find things
they can use--

1033
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:04,159
letters, old papers.

1034
01:03:04,242 --> 01:03:05,660
It doesn't take much.

1035
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:07,662
No.

1036
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,291
It was real.

1037
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,129
She knew about a...

1038
01:03:16,212 --> 01:03:17,630
a sweater I knitted.

1039
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:21,134
And songs we sang.

1040
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:28,266
Our trip
to Montego Bay.

1041
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:31,936
I'm sorry.

1042
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,481
I know this is hard.

1043
01:03:34,522 --> 01:03:36,983
People want so much
to believe.

1044
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:37,984
They're grieving,

1045
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,319
they're vulnerable...

1046
01:03:40,695 --> 01:03:42,906
and they will
give anything

1047
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:44,407
for one last moment.

1048
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:45,909
Believe me.

1049
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:48,787
These people know
what they're doing.

1050
01:03:48,828 --> 01:03:51,289
I know
how you must feel,

1051
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:54,292
but you know
you can press charges.

1052
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,089
No.

1053
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:04,010
Thank you.
