1
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,129
I start with a question,
as a filmmaker and a storyteller,

2
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,007
how should this story tell itself?

3
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,429
Because there's different strategies
that are available.

4
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,553
And what attracted me
to Stuart Beattie's screenplay

5
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,557
was the notion that it all happens
in a very short time frame,

6
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,890
meaning that it's like the third act
of a traditional drama

7
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,234
and you're making a whole
motion picture about only the third act.

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,066
One of the big reasons
I wanted to make the film

9
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,523
was that we're seeing fractions,
or fractals...

10
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,325
We're seeing a fraction
that represents the whole,

11
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,782
and only what you need to know
is what you're seeing.

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,913
And it doesn't go backward in time

13
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,211
or give you exposition
about other parts of their lives.

14
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,756
They don't really talk
about themselves that much.

15
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:35,051
So in the beginning,
I wanted to enter this scene,

16
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,004
or enter these activities,
with kind of a torn edge.

17
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,931
So we just see Vincent in LAX.

18
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,977
We hear a plane land, Vincent's in LAX.
He meets somebody who's foreign

19
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,770
and that's all you need to know
is that he's foreign.

20
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,519
He's got a South London,
working-class accent.

21
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,944
This accidental bumping
into each other, you realise,

22
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,693
if I've done my job correctly,
is not really accidental.

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,901
It's premeditated,
and a briefcase has been exchanged,

24
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,032
so that whatever it is
that Vincent's here to do,

25
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,614
you know only the few things
you need to know,

26
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,666
which is that there was
a premeditated plan to it,

27
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,243
it's secretive,

28
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,750
and it involves people
from foreign places.

29
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,877
And then we enter the domain of Max,
but we don't know what it is.

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,803
First, there's abstract pieces
of things, and then we realise

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,382
those abstract pieces of things
are, in fact, cars

32
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,435
and that the cars are cabs and that
there's drivers waiting to go on a shift.

33
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,310
And what I'm trying to direct
the attention to is that Max

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,520
IS very obsessive
about making this environment

35
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,527
of the interior of his cab
clean and perfect

36
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,951
and that he has a picture
that has some significance to him,

37
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,449
'cause he very carefully
mounts it on his visor,

38
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,077
and that he closes out chaos,
makes chaos go away.

39
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,500
This mural that we put outside the cab

40
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,256
comes from Estrada Courts,
which is in East LA,

41
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:05,342
and there's a spectacular tradition
in Los Angeles of mural painting

42
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,143
that's Hispanic, derives from Mexico.

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,188
And this is... It was painted in '74.
The painter's anonymous,

44
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,356
and he never finished it.
The vaquero doesn't have a head,

45
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,480
and for some reason
that I can't put my finger on,

46
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,858
it just really felt like it fit
into the vision of here's Max

47
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,408
launching out of the cab depot
onto the streets of Los Angeles

48
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:25,532
in late afternoon, on a shift
that probably began about 4:00.

49
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,291
Cab driver described to me as
folks who get in the back seat

50
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,791
are kind of like a radio
with a random wonder bar.

51
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,623
You never know what station
you're gonna land on,

52
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,927
and so you never know
who's gonna wind up in the back seat.

53
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,384
There's a lot of aerial shots
in the picture,

54
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:48,718
and they're shot with a Wescam
mount, which is amazingly steady.

55
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,555
This is a gas station just off
the Santa Monica Freeway

56
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:59,021
after the sun has set, and the light
in LA has this amazing red quality,

57
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,855
red-yellow quality to it.

58
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,533
And the mural of the products for sale

59
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,704
in the tienda is taken off
a tienda in East LA.

60
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,828
The fractions of LA
and how diverse LA is,

61
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,535
and diverse not in...
I grew up in Chicago.

62
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,212
Not in a Chicago or East Coast
or New York way,

63
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,759
but diverse in a Pac-Rim, Hispanic,
Los Angeles way

64
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,258
are part of the intent of,
again, the opening of the film,

65
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,760
Max's world,
and the world of Los Angeles.

66
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,344
Now, this guy here, his real name,
the actor's name is Manny Urrego,

67
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,853
and he was a limo driver.
In working out every detail,

68
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,605
the most important details
of Max's life as a cab driver

69
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,062
and the work we did
in preproduction with Jamie,

70
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,945
one of the key things we did
was make complete

71
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,994
Max's business plan
for having a limo company,

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,041
and consequently,
Manny provided spreadsheets,

73
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:59,793
a whole business plan, complete
with depreciation, overhead, salaries.

74
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,588
Annie is played by Jada Pinkett Smith,
who I worked with in Al

75
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,843
When Jada gets in the cab...

76
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,517
This is one of the first sequences
we shot,

77
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:16,564
and we were using the Sony F900
high-definition video camera.

78
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,859
If we were shooting film,
you wouldn't see any definition

79
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:24,860
of the images behind them.
And you wouldn't have this feeling

80
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:30,036
of the low light levels that make me
feel that we're actually in a cab.

81
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,383
The picture was originally written
for New York City.

82
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,804
And my interest in shooting
a motion picture that took place at night

83
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,761
in Los Angeles
in a compressed period of time

84
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,394
predates my getting my hands
on the Collateral script,

85
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,084
which was given to me
by Walter Parkes at DreamWorks.

86
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,110
And it's written by Stuart Beattie.
It's an excellent script,

87
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,909
but it was written about
the Russian Mafia and New York City.

88
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:15,206
And my interest was immediately
to transpose all of that

89
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:21,459
into not just LA as a location, but LA
with its unique, diverse population.

90
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,459
And the way it seems to be organized,

91
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,633
where there are almost, like,
sites or domains

92
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,678
that you travel to. The ethnic richness

93
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,056
and the sense of place in LA

94
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,104
is not immediately apparent
off the freeways.

95
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,976
You have to go to it.

96
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:52,285
And then in putting together the film,
again, as the storyteller,

97
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,034
the first thing I'm looking for is,
who are these people?

98
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,957
Who is Max? Who is Vincent?
Who are these characters?

99
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,705
What's their history?
Where did Vincent come from?

100
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:09,544
How did Vincent get made into
the Vincent who shows up in LA,

101
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,174
late afternoon

102
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,056
on this one day?

103
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,846
Where did Max come from?

104
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,931
Some of the answers to this
that, as the director,

105
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,857
that I build in building the characters

106
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,353
and in working with the actors
in preproduction

107
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,315
and in forming the character
of Vincent with Tom

108
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,868
and Max with Jamie had to do with

109
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,541
their histories, where they came from.

110
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,836
In fact, the back-story
of Tom and the film

111
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:49,042
was that in the offshore world
of narco-trafficking cartels,

112
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,758
they have the budgets
to buy the best, and they do.

113
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,805
Particularly since the end
of the Cold War went on,

114
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,224
that labour market has become available.

115
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,932
People who are ex-KGB, ex-Stasi,
as well as Brits and Americans

116
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,938
from special forces, Israelis.

117
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,109
And these cartels also have
the best of computer technicians,

118
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,113
signal-intercept capabilities
to run sophisticated counter-intel,

119
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,491
as well as attorneys
and private investigators to discover

120
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,202
if there's any operations
against them or whether or not

121
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:24,785
there's a Department of Justice
investigation or a DEA investigation

122
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,500
or any indictments pending
against them in the United States.

123
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,706
And that's exactly what's happened here.

124
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,925
The group that's hired Vincent
has found out

125
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,887
that there are pending indictments
and that an assistant U.S. attorney,

126
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:43,596
played by Jada, is, in fact, about
to indict, in a grand-jury hearing

127
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,728
that's supposed to begin
tomorrow morning, certain figures.

128
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,355
And they have had
private investigators working,

129
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,859
and they've discovered the identities
of five key witnesses

130
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,195
and have spent the last three
or four months working up

131
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,027
an operation to kill these witnesses.

132
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,782
And tonight's the night.

133
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,911
Max and Annie, who have just met
in this cab, Max doesn't even know

134
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,709
she's a prosecutor yet,
are completely unaware of this.

135
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,048
I wanted to form characters who were
absolute strangers to each other

136
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:16,755
and constituted opposites to each other
in every conceivable way that I could,

137
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,591
because they're about to be
thrown together into this cab.

138
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,891
One of the big things
that appealed to me about this film

139
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:30,442
is to tell a story the way
this story tells itself,

140
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,941
which is that since we're only
in these 10 hours,

141
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,525
we're only seeing
a small fraction of a whole life.

142
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,112
And since we're only in the 10 hours,
the challenge is,

143
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:45,791
"Can I design those fractions
so that they become glimpses,

144
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,164
“ "that you kind of sense the person?"

145
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,086
To do that, one has to invent

146
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,256
the history of Vincent,
the history of Max,

147
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:58,008
and then choose those details
to put into the 10 hours of tonight.

148
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,717
The way Max dresses or the kind of
self-deceptive attitude he has

149
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,018
when he talks about a limo company.

150
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,470
The film doesn't do

151
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:11,604
what a life experience of these 10 hours
also would not do,

152
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,313
which is to have exposition
or to travel backwards in time

153
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,115
via flashbacks or any of those
other devices,

154
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,285
but instead just to keep us
immediate into this present,

155
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,161
and yet to have a greater degree
of knowingness about their lives.

156
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:38,135
Max is averse to impulsive action.
He has planned to perfection

157
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,842
this business plan, in which
he's gonna set up a limo company.

158
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,764
He's been doing it for 12 years.

159
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,389
Now, one of the hardest things
for an actor to play is indecision.

160
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:52,020
That in-between state means that...
That's exactly what Max is.

161
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,648
He's a man who has big dreams
and has realised none of them.

162
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,733
So for Jamie to play this,

163
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:01,943
it means that he must generate
the object of Max's desire,

164
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,530
really experience it and feel it,
and then invent what impedes him

165
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:11,164
from actualising it so that he exists
in that kind of twilight zone

166
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,121
of potential and frustration.

167
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:18,254
And in this case,
it all becomes personified by Annie,

168
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,676
with whom he has this stunning rapport,

169
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,051
as played out by Jada
and Jamie right here.

170
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,547
But he can't bring himself
to actually ask her out,

171
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,137
and the way Jamie plays it
and the way Jada plays I,

172
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,516
I, for one, feel Jamie melt
when Jada's eyes look up

173
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,392
at the moment that just passed.

174
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:21,693
There's this kind of instant regret
at his having failed himself.

175
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,029
And as she's leaving,

176
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,162
she realizes she has no way
to ever have contact with this guy again.

177
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,540
She could take cabs in LA
for the next 15 years

178
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,794
and might not run into him.
So she responds to her impulse

179
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,843
and she gives him her card,
and then the contact is made.

180
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,897
Feeling that she's just been
in this cab with this man

181
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,570
who has other plans in life
beyond driving a cab

182
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,615
but just understood her
and was so generous

183
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,445
about giving up something that's his
because he recognised she needed it.

184
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,780
And it's kind of the rapport and intimacy

185
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,241
that can be struck up
only between strangers,

186
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,872
because you believe
there's no consequence,

187
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,458
"cause you're never gonna
see each other again.

188
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,333
So you can be open.

189
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,290
So you can be open.

190
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:29,925
Vincent is somebody who is decisive
and who's embraced force

191
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,929
as a way of controlling

192
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,307
his environment, as a way of...

193
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,105
And I don't think Vincent is
actually actively aware of this,

194
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,229
but as a way of
controlling the environment

195
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,153
so that bad things don't happen to him.

196
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:47,324
He, consequently, is somebody
who can be improvisational.

197
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,402
He's highly trained, he takes action,
he has opinions.

198
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,533
Max is exactly the opposite.

199
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,955
Vincent chooses public transportation,
and the thought behind that

200
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,916
is the same thought
that's behind Vincent's suit.

201
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,547
It serves two purposes.

202
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,301
One is to be indistinguishable,
to be anonymous,

203
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,974
so that if somebody witnesses Vincent

204
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,262
do an illegal act and are later
questioned by the police

205
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,644
and they're trying to describe him,
it's a guy with grey hair,

206
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,648
kind of average-sized, grey suit,
white shirt, there's nothing there.

207
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,150
So that choice is,

208
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,198
in the first instance,
simply really good tradecraft,

209
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,198
to be inconspicuous by being anonymous.

210
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,660
And that's one of the reasons that
he also picks public transportation.

211
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,868
In his mind,
and according to his plan for tonight,

212
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,543
the cab driver who's driving him around

213
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,045
will not, in fact, know what he's doing
at each of the stops he has to make.

214
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,381
This is an interesting shot.
I'm gonna digress here because, again,

215
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:52,840
this is something only possible
with high-definition video.

216
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,676
It became a whole strategy
about how to see the world

217
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,308
that Vincent and Max
are gonna traverse this night.

218
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,394
I viewed the first scene between Max
and Vincent in the cab as casting.

219
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,733
Vincent is being
provocative intentionally,

220
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,237
saying things about Los Angeles,
"Nobody knows each other,"

221
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,364
to see what Max's reaction is gonna be.

222
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,698
And if Max was aggressively defensive,
Vincent might just have changed cabs.

223
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,877
And when Tom and I
were working in preproduction,

224
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:26,378
I thought that it was likely
that Vincent, in fact, had a cab

225
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,628
that took him from the airport,

226
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,086
and he didn't like that cab driver
for whatever reason,

227
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,386
and so he switched out

228
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,215
when he went to reconnoitre
Annie's building,

229
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,427
and that Max is, in fact,
his second cab of the night.

230
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,730
Vincent would've been one of these
guys who would've been recruited

231
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,274
in the private sector.
He probably lives offshore.

232
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,070
He has a domicile that's maybe
in Uttahorn Province in Thailand

233
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,489
or Songkhla in Thailand,
some place where...

234
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,614
A Buddhist country where people
leave everybody else alone a lot.

235
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,446
Max comes from a middle-class family,

236
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,876
Ladera Heights in Los Angeles,
and he has a plan, a business plan

237
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,580
to set up a limo company,
so that driving a cab is only temporary.

238
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,756
It's only a means to an end.
We're about to find out

239
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,505
that temporary's been about 12 years.

240
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,021
The other aspect
about Vincent's appearance is,

241
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,398
again, in building the character

242
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,106
and how to make these two characters
be oppositional,

243
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,942
what Vincent's chosen to wear,
it tells us things.

244
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,994
I believe that audiences
are much brighter

245
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,200
than they are aware of.

246
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,999
There's a lot of information they take in
on a feeling level.

247
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:48,706
There's a cut to his suit that says
perhaps it was custom-tailored,

248
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,292
but not in Milan or London or New York.

249
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,344
In my mind, it was in Kowloon.

250
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,550
The thing about his hair, the scars
on his hands, scars on his face...

251
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,728
In effect, he's kind of rough trade
in a good suit,

252
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,648
prematurely grey,
kind of a steely aspect to him.

253
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,820
Those are design issues
that are designed to tell us,

254
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,820
tell the audience, tell you things
about who he is on a feeling level,

255
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,869
not on anything
that is didactic or spoken to you.

256
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,993
It was tricky to arrive
to some of these looks

257
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,700
and some of these issues because...

258
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,330
And this was also
the challenge of the film

259
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,254
that made it very exciting for me
to do it and want to do it,

260
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:34,175
which is that when you compress
the time frame of a narrative,

261
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,424
and it's down to under two hours,

262
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:40,007
and you're just in one locale
for one night,

263
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,389
it also means there's gonna be one suit
and one wardrobe change,

264
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,349
so everything becomes
inordinately important.

265
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,146
It's kind of like driving a race car,

266
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,477
where a small input in steering
has a very radical effect.

267
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,064
So the slightest change,
because it's cumulative,

268
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:55,859
So the slightest change,
because it's cumulative,

269
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,486
becomes a big deal.

270
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:05,366
Now, this location is an alley off of...
In Pico Union.

271
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,160
That's downtown Los Angeles
in the background.

272
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,335
It's about two miles away.

273
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,461
You couldn't see this, again,
without using digital video.

274
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:19,137
The building Vincent's walking up in
is at 1839 South Union.

275
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,679
When you're working on a film
during preproduction,

276
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,884
you find yourself moving through
different neighborhoods

277
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,844
as you're looking for your locations,

278
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,306
and you often times get glimpses
into lives and people's residences,

279
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,442
and you see fragments
of working folks and their conditions,

280
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,693
and sometimes these fragments
can speak about

281
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,118
a whole life or a whole existence
that's not really part of the story,

282
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,946
yet it is really part of the environment.

283
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,999
And I find that very powerful,
and sometimes

284
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,077
I'll try to build that
into the environment

285
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,084
as something that maybe
is glimpsed in passing

286
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,211
and maybe something that we don't take in

287
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,884
except on kind of a sensory level.

288
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,884
And so it's a small detail, but the
idea of these two guys in this room,

289
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,761
with a line that they run across the room

290
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,638
where they hang their six
or seven good shirts

291
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,560
that they brought up from Mexico,

292
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,017
that was a particularly unique facet
of something we saw,

293
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,643
and so I reproduced it here.

294
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,566
The local gang,
which is the 18th Street gang,

295
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,403
provided the graffiti
which is on the walls here.

296
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,750
Vincent did not expect Ramone
to fall out the window.

297
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,298
That's an accident.

298
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,342
His first instinct is to look around him

299
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,340
to see if he's picked up
any surveillance.

300
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,014
Has anybody... Are there neighbours
looking out the window?

301
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:49,311
Has somebody dialled 9117?
Are there police coming in?

302
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,064
And this is ironic here.

303
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:08,747
And Tom's ironic timing,
I think, is both subtle and masterful.

304
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,167
And in analyzing I, how irony is achieved

305
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:17,669
is by Tom playing it
as if he's as oblivious

306
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,671
to what's self-evident as Max is.

307
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,504
Max says, "You killed him."
Tom's response is,

308
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,636
"No, I shot him.
The bullets and the fall killed him."

309
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,345
And I'm an admirer of Billy Wilder,
who used irony a lot,

310
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,522
kind of a Berliner wit from Weimar.

311
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:39,478
And so I spent a lot of time studying
Cary Grant's work in Front Page

312
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,941
in preparation for Vincent's
use of irony, his droll wit

313
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,241
and his facile nihilism.

314
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,117
And so there's a kind of homage
to Billy Wilder

315
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:55,202
way back in the preparation
I did for these aspects

316
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:59,585
of Tom's character,
and then Tom just nails it.

317
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,048
Jamie's comedic timing is spectacular
just as it was in the last scene.

318
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,049
He doesn't need any help from anybody.

319
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,762
But I think underlying that is actually
his native talent as an actor.

320
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,416
Jamie trained not as a comedian,
he trained as a musician.

321
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,414
And then when he wasn't getting work
as a musician,

322
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,711
he saw people getting work
doing stand-up comedy,

323
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,665
so he acted like a stand-up comic.

324
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,172
Whatever the origins were,
his timing and gestures

325
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,426
and attitude and hesitation
and stuttering...

326
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,099
Just experiencing it, it's great,

327
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:55,725
and if you look at it analytically,
it all hits in a certain perfect rhythm.

328
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:03,687
Here's Mark Ruffalo,
the fine, fine actor, playing Fanning

329
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,695
to a piece of score by Tom Rothrock
called Rollin' Crumblin',

330
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:10,277
kind of a blues concert thing.

331
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,955
I had Ruffalo spend a lot of time
with a guy named Q,

332
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,377
who's an undercover narc in LA.

333
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,253
And we borrowed liberally
from Q's appearance,

334
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,962
in the way he holsters his gun
and the way he has these little clips

335
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,138
that hold the magazines on his belt,
designed to be...

336
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,092
If you just look at him,
you don't realise he's carrying.

337
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,097
And if you saw Q,

338
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:41,433
you would never guess
that he was, in fact, a detective

339
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,518
by both his carriage and attitude,

340
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,775
as well as by his appearance.

341
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,426
This apartment is in, really,
the same building,

342
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,475
and the decor in this apartment is,
in fact, what's there in real life.

343
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,145
It was one of those places
where you happen upon it

344
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,893
and it's so evocative of a mood,

345
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:28,321
of a kind of working-class
Hispanic apartment

346
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,527
in this section of the city.

347
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:34,362
It's so representative of that, that other
than putting in a big-screen television,

348
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,537
we changed nothing. So the fish tank,

349
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,537
and on the opposite wall
that we're looking at right now,

350
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:45,043
this backlit, strange
aqua art object of a ship

351
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,463
is also...

352
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,798
Belongs to the guys, two guys,
who actually live here.

353
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:58,093
What this launches is the sub-story
of a quest by Fanning,

354
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,896
who has very solid procedure,
an unorthodox appearance

355
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,601
belying a very orthodox
and sound procedure.

356
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:10,563
And it's gonna lead Fanning to be
the only man who's gonna realise that

357
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,649
A, witnesses are being killed

358
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:17,658
and B, that Vincent is not in fact Max,
but in fact is Vincent.

359
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,457
He'll be the sole person who has
what happened here correctly

360
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:21,702
as the events of the night unfold.

361
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,667
As the events of the night unfold.

362
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:31,752
We're now entering a long scene,
and what's interesting to...

363
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:36,305
What may or may not be interesting
to people who aspire to direct

364
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,430
or want to know
how films are made is that,

365
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,681
for myself, I have to know
exactly what a scene is trying to do,

366
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:47,608
and I believe that
I should be able to distill that

367
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:52,189
into one simple set of words,
called "the action."

368
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:56,697
And in this case, it's, "What is Vincent
doing? What does Vincent want?"

369
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:00,451
And it usually has to be expressed in
the infinitive, and it is that Vincent...

370
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,830
It is "to manage."
Vincent needs to manage Max.

371
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,628
Now, there's many other layers

372
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,508
and many other things
that are happening here.

373
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,339
Max has just experienced a dead body.

374
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,222
He's never seen
this kind of violence before.

375
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:25,430
If there was an adrenaline rush
that kept him functioning in the alley,

376
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,436
now that he's driving,
the adrenaline's worn off.

377
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:32,236
He's on the precipice of falling into
shock or going into a fugue state.

378
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,459
So one of the things he's doing

379
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,288
is throwing out
some really provocative thoughts

380
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,498
that are also part of Vincent's themes,

381
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,335
but nevertheless,
they're being used to provoke Max.

382
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,386
And that's keeping Max sharp.

383
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,386
Vincent's saying that, "What difference
does it make if one fat guy falls?

384
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:04,226
"There's six billion people on the planet,
Max, what are you worried about?"

385
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:27,166
He's giving him justifications using
everything from social Darwinism

386
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,961
to the I Ching to advise Max
in a therapeutic way,

387
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,881
how Max ought to think about
the events that have just happened.

388
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,583
And Max is confounded.

389
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,793
By being confounded,
he's also preoccupied.

390
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,925
And, in fact, he is still driving

391
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,053
'cause Vincent, from his point of view,
has a number of jobs to do.

392
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,851
He's got to watch out for...
See if they picked up surveillance.

393
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,771
You'll see him throw looks from
time to time out the side of the car.

394
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,565
Secondly, he's working on his PC,

395
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,735
because he has to go
to target number two.

396
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,322
And number three,
he's got to keep Max functioning.

397
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,382
And what he does next is
put Max into this impossible situation,

398
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,255
that Max has to
talk his way out of a ticket,

399
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,426
or Vincent is gonna Kill
both of these two cops.

400
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,779
Or Vincent is gonna Kill
both of these two cops.

401
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,355
The officer on the left
is played by Jamie McBride,

402
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:43,443
who is, in fact, an actual LAPD officer.

403
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,620
He's ex-CRASH unit.

404
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,078
I've used him as an actor before
in Robbery Homicide Division.

405
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,455
And the actor on the right
is an extremely fine actor

406
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,958
named Richard T. Jones
who's a regular on Judging Amy,

407
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,086
which stars Amy Brenneman,
who I worked with in Heat.

408
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,633
But getting back to Jamie McBride,

409
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,429
it's really interesting
for a director to work with people

410
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,598
who have some native ability to act.

411
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,599
The most difficult thing
for them to do, by the way,

412
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,525
is to play a character
that's close to them in life.

413
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,523
It's much more easy,
for example, for Jamie McBride

414
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,480
to be playing a villain
than for him to be playing a cop.

415
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,986
But in working with them,
it would be a mistake for me

416
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,114
to expect them to have
the kind of technique

417
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,354
that comes from years
and years of training.

418
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,744
As a director, I have to find the means,

419
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,417
maybe through subtle suggestion
or whatever,

420
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:37,588
to help Jamie McBride lose himself
in the moment of what he's doing,

421
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:42,214
because it will be really good
and spontaneous only the one time.

422
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:48,220
And what Jamie McBride is doing here
is not playing, he's doing.

423
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,644
And even though it's something
as routine as a traffic stop,

424
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:56,019
nevertheless, there's a 120-man
film crew all around Jamie McBride,

425
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:02,947
and for him to be unselfconscious
about that process is the objective.

426
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:07,448
And to just do what he, in fact,
does at a normal traffic stop.

427
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,370
You can see how good
Richard T. Jones is there.

428
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,751
I've had people ask me if both these
guys were, in fact, real LAPD.

429
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:52,955
There's a certain fatalistic attitude that
Jamie has as he sits back in the cab,

430
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:57,126
as if he's just been condemned

431
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:57,163
as if he's just been condemned

432
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:00,542
to get back behind the wheel
and be in his seat and ride this cab.

433
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:08,880
This is an alley right off of Wilshire
Boulevard on the edge of Koreatown.

434
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:21,226
And Max is... A lot of Max's character
is built around this inability to confront

435
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,316
and the evasion and avoidance of
doing what, in fact, he wants to do.

436
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:34,076
And that's when there's the... We have
the impulses to do things in life.

437
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,330
We want to do things,
we enact them or chart a course

438
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,459
that takes us to
a certain outcome, a certain goal.

439
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,838
And Max has these things, and he has
a lot of latent power as an individual,

440
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:52,139
but it all exists behind a wall of
repression that he can't break through.

441
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,149
And one of the interesting constructions
of the picture,

442
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,317
viewed as the big picture,

443
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:09,820
is the collision of these two guys
in this situation

444
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,033
in which, at the end,

445
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:23,997
Vincent actually becomes an agent
for the liberation, in a way, of Max

446
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:30,303
and enables Max to manifest
his individuality and, in fact, act.

447
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,234
And reciprocally, Max,
towards the end of the film,

448
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,942
provides us and Vincent
with an illumination into Vincent.

449
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,448
There's a moment in time,
later in the film,

450
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,406
when Max sees beyond
the end of Vincent's gun

451
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,118
and sees Vincent for who Vincent is,
which is damaged goods.

452
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,421
And at that point in the film,
Max's judgment

453
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:10,468
to Vincent is devastating to Vincent,
and he's truly impacted upon.

454
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:14,297
The Teflon coating, the impervious Armour

455
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:18,100
that Vincent,
in this part of the film has, is gone.

456
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:23,556
And one of the designs
in the evolution of his character,

457
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,857
of Vincent's character,
through the film that I hoped to get

458
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:30,029
was the glimpse of fractures
in Vincent's Armour,

459
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:34,154
the realization that
he's not this machine-like presence,

460
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,952
that, in fact, there's something wrong
with Vincent tonight.

461
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,076
And it begins in the scene
that happens later,

462
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,079
with the paroxysm of remorse

463
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,628
that Vincent does after he shoots
somebody named Daniel.

464
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,955
And some other small subtleties

465
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,292
that I designed into our understanding
of Vincent's character,

466
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,880
hoping to try and communicate those
to an audience almost subliminally,

467
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,719
almost things that you sense about him

468
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,554
without even being aware
that you're sensing them.

469
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:05,435
And that sensing lays a foundation
for actual overt reactions

470
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,563
when Vincent has them
much, much later in the film.

471
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,064
That's all working backwards
from the end about the necessity,

472
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,149
I believe, to know the man,

473
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,235
to have characters
that are three-dimensional,

474
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,039
meaning that he can commit heinous acts

475
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,459
and is responsible for his actions,

476
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,290
and there should be
consequence to those actions.

477
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,918
At the same time,
you glimpse something wounded

478
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,795
behind those actions

479
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:36,595
and come to whatever conclusion
you would like to come to.

480
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,344
One of those conclusions might be
that, given different circumstances,

481
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,552
Vincent might have been
somebody else in life.

482
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,980
Understanding Vincent
doesn't let him off the hook.

483
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,478
Even having positive emotional feelings
for him

484
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,649
does not let Vincent off the hook

485
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,734
does not let Vincent off the hook

486
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,314
for the judgment
that we render upon his actions,

487
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,321
because I believe that
you're responsible for what you do,

488
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,370
and your intent is something that
we all maybe sympathize with,

489
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,950
but that's got nothing to do
with responsibility for your actions.

490
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,661
But it's dimensional to have
both be there.

491
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,373
That's what makes characters
fascinating to me,

492
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,548
and I wanted to try and fuel that.

493
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:18,300
So to do that, I built backwards
towards the front of the film

494
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,224
the sense that there's something
going on with Vincent that we...

495
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,096
That he's not just machine-like.

496
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:28,681
Tom trained for about three months
with live ammunition

497
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:32,143
under extremely rigorous, safe conditions

498
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,025
on the LA County Sheriff's
combat shooting ranges.

499
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,904
And Tom had not fired live rounds
through a handgun before,

500
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,782
so for him it was a new experience,
and it's a whole different deal

501
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,871
when you're doing it for real
than when you're firing blanks.

502
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,747
And the true lethal potential
of a firearm is...

503
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:52,796
And your managing of it becomes a
very strong dynamic in a performance,

504
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,419
particularly when your skills...

505
00:34:54,509 --> 00:35:00,050
And Tom is extraordinarily skilled
at everything athletic that he tries.

506
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,928
Particularly when the skills
become so schooled in him

507
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,134
that they become truly second nature.

508
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:22,238
But the real sign of how
integrated Tom was able to become

509
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,071
with the skills that Vincent,
in fact, would have,

510
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,953
is the expression
that's on Vincent's face

511
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,911
after he shoots these guys
and when he's holstering his gun.

512
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,343
He's not thinking about holstering
the gun. He can do that in his sleep.

513
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,012
And immediately after
he's fired that last round,

514
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,011
his attention gets focused
on Wilshire Boulevard,

515
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,263
down at the end of the alley.

516
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:51,189
"Is anybody coming at us from there?
Did anybody hear these gunshots?

517
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,309
"What's Max doing?"

518
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,937
He immediately switches over
to the next task,

519
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:57,770
and that's absolutely perfect craft.

520
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,982
And it's exactly what somebody
who had a lot of trigger time,

521
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:04,159
who had been in the kinds of conflicts
in various places in the world

522
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,328
that we imagine Vincent had been in,
that's exactly what he'd be doing.

523
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,786
He wouldn't be worrying
about how he holsters his gun.

524
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,663
So that is a beautiful little movement,

525
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:16,338
and it's a testament
to the commitment of Tom

526
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,133
to the work of
turning himself into Vincent

527
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,840
and having deeper
and deeper understandings,

528
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,137
as well as acquiring
all the physical skills.

529
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:30,061
There's no cutting in it, and Tom draws
and fires five rounds in 1.4 seconds.

530
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,978
And we did that on the range.

531
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,023
And we did that with dummies
and with plates and stuff

532
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,647
and with live ammunition. And it's hard.

533
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,354
As well as a lot of close-quarter combat,

534
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,610
a lot of hand-to-hand combat,

535
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,695
of a very brutal, short, efficient nature.

536
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,495
Not martial arts.

537
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,911
And all the other tradecraft
that Vincent would have,

538
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,459
a lot of which doesn't even appear
in the text of the film.

539
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,662
But it's a whole package

540
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,465
and it had to do with
reconnoitring each of these people.

541
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:05,718
But the deeper work that goes into
this kind of thing is, in fact,

542
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,008
But the deeper work that goes into
this kind of thing is, in fact,

543
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,885
how did Vincent become Vincent?

544
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:12,265
And Tom and I did a lot of work
in trying to understand

545
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,346
where this guy came from.

546
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,273
If he was in a foster home
for part of his time,

547
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,726
if he had an institutionalized childhood,

548
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,778
and he was back in
the public school system at age 11,

549
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,027
that would have been
sometime in the '70s.

550
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,324
He would have been dressed
very awkwardly.

551
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,324
He would've probably been ostracized
"cause he'd have looked odd,

552
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,874
and the kind of brutality of, you know,
preteens and early adolescence.

553
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,380
Probably which... We postulated
an alcoholic, abusive father

554
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:42,709
who was culturally very progressive.

555
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,887
He was probably part of Ed Sadlowski's
Steelworkers Local in Gary.

556
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,884
He was a Vietnam veteran.

557
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,762
He had friends who were African-American,

558
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,847
the south side of Chicago,
the Checkerboard Lounge

559
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,019
is 30 minutes away on the Calumet Skyway.

560
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,723
So the father,
probably in the '60s and early '70s,

561
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,229
was probably an aficionado of jazz.

562
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,402
There was a great jazz scene
on the south side of Chicago,

563
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,820
Modern Jazz Quartet.

564
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:07,275
But it's almost as if
the father blamed the son, i.e. Vincent,

565
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,449
for what happened to the mother,

566
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,746
and the father drank
as Gary was being reduced into...

567
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,370
You know, looked like Dresden
at the end of the Second World War.

568
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,952
The father never tutored the boy in jazz,

569
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,333
but the boy extolled the virtue
of knowing about jazz

570
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,882
'cause he heard his father talk about
jazz, not to him, but to other people.

571
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,426
And that's why he knew about jazz.

572
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,424
And that's why he learned about jazz.

573
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,769
His father, Vincent's father,
never tutored Vincent about jazz

574
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:40,099
because he had rejected
his son and ignored him.

575
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,776
It was something
that got constructed as back-story

576
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,570
in the work I did with Tom
during preproduction

577
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,778
and understanding every aspect
of the character, of who Vincent was,

578
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,114
much more than appears
in the text of the film.

579
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:56,324
So that the fractions of Vincent-ness
that we have in the text of the film,

580
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:00,206
within these 10 hours, could
resonate with the totality of a life

581
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,958
the same as they would
with anybody you met, you know.

582
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,499
We all bring our whole history with us
into any moment of the present.

583
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:23,275
This is my pal, Pete Berg,
who's an extremely talented director,

584
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,069
as well as being a fine actor,
playing Weidner,

585
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,022
who's Fanning's careerist partner
on this crime scene.

586
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,196
Who's Fanning's careerist partner
on this crime scene.

587
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,779
And we segue to a jazz club.

588
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,410
And this is Barry Shabaka Henley,

589
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,209
who also played Herbert Muhammad in Ali.

590
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,838
Max doesn't like jazz,

591
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,966
and I got the idea
that Max didn't like jazz

592
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,343
because Muhammad Ali doesn't like jazz,

593
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,684
and Muhammad Ali doesn't like blues.
Muhammad Ali only likes soul.

594
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,411
But Vincent knows all about jazz
and has just explained it.

595
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,741
And in a way, that's kind of related.

596
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,582
And that is not a direct metaphor
for what's happening in the film,

597
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,084
but it's very closely associated.

598
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,920
It's almost an analogue, rather than
a metaphor, about improvisation,

599
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,342
about having a theme, having a structure,

600
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,295
but then being able to improvise.

601
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:58,829
And so Vincent here is starting
to verbalize the themes that are...

602
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,449
He sees into Max, he really reads Max.

603
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,956
That's part of Vincent's job,
that's part of his craft, is to read Max.

604
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:08,414
So Vincent already knows
all that we know about Max,

605
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,296
which is that Max is not improvisational.

606
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,423
And he also knows that Max
is along on a ride

607
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,470
in which Max has no idea
what's gonna happen to him

608
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,591
10 minutes from now.

609
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:21,428
So it's really the first articulation
of two of the central themes

610
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,771
each of these guys personify.
They're in opposition to each other.

611
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,522
The music that we just heard
is Spanish Key by Miles Davis.

612
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,105
We cut down the 17-minute length,
which is on Bitches Brew,

613
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,282
to a little over three-and-a-half minutes.

614
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,377
And Shabaka,
playing the character of Daniel,

615
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,750
relates an incident in which Miles Davis

616
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:53,880
came to South Central
after recording at Columbia

617
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,053
and sat in on a session

618
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,555
in one of the great jazz clubs
that came out of South Central.

619
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,601
This is after the flowering
of West Coast bebop,

620
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,274
which, in part, came out of graduates

621
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,898
of Jefferson High School in Los Angeles.

622
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,151
Dexter Gordon, Lester Young.

623
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,074
Just a whole slew of jazz musicians
came out of it, and then they were

624
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,528
very much part of that scene in the '50s,

625
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,953
along with other West Coast
jazz regulars,

626
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,830
which would have included, say,
Charlie Mingus, Wardell Gray,

627
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,286
Thelonious Monk, Chet Baker, like that.

628
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,471
The anecdote that Daniel's relating
here is an actual event

629
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:44,142
from Miles Davis' life.
Miles Davis played a guest-starring role

630
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,560
in two episodes I did
on two television series.

631
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,389
He played a character for me
in Miami Vice

632
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:53,478
and a more profound role
in one episode of Crime Story,

633
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,985
in which we were telling the story
as a two-parter of the Moulin Rouge,

634
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:01,660
which was an African-American casino
in segregated Las Vegas.

635
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:06,661
He played in that one as well.
And so I had some contact with him.

636
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,999
The anecdote that's related here
is interesting,

637
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,831
because it talks about

638
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:18,502
the violent reaction that you will have

639
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,430
if you're somebody whose concentration
is so totally focused.

640
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:27,014
Daniel talks about Miles' head
IS in a musical head space, you know,

641
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,847
his reaction to being pulled out of it
was fierce.

642
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,558
And that is what you feel
when you are concentrated,

643
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,770
if you're an actor
concentrating on a scene,

644
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,776
while they're resetting lights
and somebody disturbs you.

645
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,198
It's a violence. And it's not personal,

646
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,620
but it comes from high, high order
of focus and concentration,

647
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,414
and the irritation sometimes
almost is in direct proportion

648
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,742
to your ability to focus.

649
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,082
And there's nothing I can imagine
requiring focus more

650
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,415
than doing the art
that Miles Davis did, so...

651
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,811
There's a stillness to the depth

652
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,893
of which Tom is into the moment

653
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:23,109
in this particular scene right now
that always I admire.

654
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,990
He is so economically,
completely in the moment.

655
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,888
He knows what he's gonna do.

656
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,804
He just has that sideways glance
to see if the waitress,

657
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:57,393
who he heard leave, has, in fact, left.
And she has.

658
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,820
This is where, I think,
great acting resides.

659
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,696
There's a pure economy of motion.

660
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,867
There's immobility
when there should be immobility.

661
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:11,448
You don't program this kind of work.
It's there or it's not there.

662
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,536
And there's a paroxysm of regret.

663
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,765
That's the first anomaly to the perfect,
machine-like presentation

664
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:15,095
we've had from Vincent.
And it's designed to be an anomaly.

665
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,684
It's designed to be a deviation

666
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,357
from the way we have seen him
up to this moment.

667
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,561
And Max can't take it
and wanders off on this broken course

668
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,441
without much navigation.

669
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,277
And the way he walks across the sidewalk,

670
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,237
he heads towards the parking meter,
then to the left.

671
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:34,164
And Vincent, who has repressed regret
and is right back in business,

672
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,288
back on the case,
reminds Max he's not playing.

673
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:40,120
Max provokes a theme,
"If you were playing him,

674
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,752
"what would you have done
if he'd gotten the answer right?"

675
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,300
And I wanted that question
to remain unanswered.

676
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:50,256
I want it posed, but not answered.
So I then interrupt it with

677
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,137
Lenny the dispatcher, who returns.

678
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,640
Now, the voice of Lenny
is the voice of Michael Waxman,

679
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,563
who was my first assistant director.

680
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,437
He's a dear friend, and we've done
many movies together, so...

681
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,940
He just was reading these lines
so that we could shoot them,

682
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,489
'cause Lenny was always to be off camera.

683
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:11,193
He was always to be off-screen.
So we were gonna find a voice later on.

684
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,871
We tried to cast some other voices,
but we couldn't find a voice

685
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,245
that was as wonderfully kind of annoying

686
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,873
as Michael's voice, in fact, can be.

687
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,134
Now, this is another use
of high-definition video.

688
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,633
I wanted to see the world
that they're moving through,

689
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:34,682
and this is nothing you would see
in normal motion picture film.

690
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,511
You can see the clouds in the sky
behind Vincent,

691
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:42,065
and you also are able to see
the colonnade of trees behind Max

692
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,357
disappearing in the distance.

693
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:46,152
You normally wouldn't be able to see
any of that.

694
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,923
Now, Vincent is about to deliver
a second anomaly.

695
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,798
The first was the regret that he felt.

696
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,925
It became kind of a paroxysm
and then he repressed,

697
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,177
and the second one is gonna be right now.

698
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,056
When he says to Max,

699
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,559
"She carried you in her womb
for nine months,"

700
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,392
as if there's a special consciousness

701
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:30,105
of the significance of mothers
that Vincent possesses.

702
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:43,201
This sentiment will continue
in the scene with Ida

703
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:49,041
and provoke almost a sibling rivalry
for the affections of Ida

704
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:54,130
between Vincent and Ida's son Max,
which Vincent wins.

705
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:57,306
We're gonna find out later on
that Vincent never had a mother.

706
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,390
It's an accumulation of small anomalies

707
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:08,193
to indicate that something
subterranean is going on with Vincent.

708
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,155
That something is fracturing
with this man.

709
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,481
And the coincidence,

710
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,659
which is part of the wonderful structure
of the piece.

711
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,784
Stuart Beattie's narrative construction
is unchanged.

712
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:26,457
It's as if you take a screenplay
and throw it in an X-ray or an MR,

713
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,459
and you see
the underlying engineering of it.

714
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:31,549
And that's what's so brilliant
about what Stuart Beattie did.

715
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:36,172
These two vectors
of Fanning going some place...

716
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:39,178
We don't know where it is. We're gonna
find out later he's going to the morgue.

717
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,305
So it's as if
the hospital is Martin Luther King,

718
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,432
which would also have the morgue in it.

719
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:50,443
And Max and Vincent
going to visit Max's mother,

720
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,236
"cause Max does this nightly.

721
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,584
He has a complex relationship
with his mother.

722
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,883
One can almost imagine
that there's three older brothers

723
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,257
whose wives have made them
move out of Los Angeles,

724
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,931
to Houston, some place,
to get away from the mother.

725
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,898
Now, she says to Vincent,
"They're beautiful."

726
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,444
And Vincent's struck by that.

727
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:43,072
And Jamie's playing in this scene

728
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:49,954
of betrayal is, I think, profound.

729
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:55,125
And then Vincent is charmed
and gets seductive.

730
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,024
But the hurt in Jamie's eyes,

731
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:15,524
I just thought he just did
a wonderful job right here.

732
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,072
And then the picture...
Another thing I liked about this picture,

733
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,241
one of the reasons I did it,
is that it had a multiplicity of forms,

734
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:25,037
of different kinds of narrative
all contained in the same picture.

735
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:28,583
And this becomes ordinary sitcom.

736
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:50,389
Irma Hall started as a schoolteacher
in rural Texas,

737
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,816
from a town that's next door
to the town of 8,000 people

738
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,392
that Jamie Foxx grew up in.

739
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,776
And so they were comparing notes
when we were shooting here this day,

740
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:03,406
and they both knew some of
the same officials in the school system.

741
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:07,409
And Jamie went to graduate
from his high school after studying...

742
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,787
Being both on the football team
and studying piano,

743
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,916
and got a scholarship into university
in classical piano.

744
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:22,633
This is the first time Max is
gonna manifest an impulsive act

745
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,717
that is completely irrational,
which is to steal Vincent's briefcase,

746
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:33,056
and run where? Do what with it?
It's an illogical, irrational act.

747
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,029
But it's provoked by Vincent winning
the affection of Max's mother.

748
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:49,660
And this puts us out of the hospital
and across a footbridge

749
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:54,916
Over the 5 Freeway in a
neighbourhood known as City Terrace.

750
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,630
It's just east of downtown,
and what we're looking at right now

751
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,760
is westbound on the 5 towards
downtown LA in the distance.

752
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:12,353
This is a very hotly-contested turf
between two gangs

753
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,272
on opposite sides of the freeway,
and so this night

754
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,226
we had elaborate security precautions.

755
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,121
The question that gets asked
later in the film,

756
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,375
in the scene after the shootout at Fever,

757
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,336
actually relates to this moment in time.

758
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:44,044
It's when Max says to Vincent,
"And why haven't you killed me yet?"

759
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,550
Because by everything we know
about Vincent,

760
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,007
that's exactly what should happen
right now.

761
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,736
And we start to wonder...

762
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:09,490
And it's a question whose origin
is in this moment,

763
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:13,532
and in the continuing relationship
that starts to become

764
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:19,587
almost the relationship of two brothers
who are violently quarreling,

765
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,085
but nevertheless two brothers.

766
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,714
Although Vincent will,
in a kind of schizoid way,

767
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,091
have those relations with Max,

768
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:31,641
but then he'll go back
to being on the job.

769
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,055
The question is,

770
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,644
what is Vincent seeking from Max?
What does Vincent want from Max?

771
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:44,696
Why, as they get closer
and strike a rapport

772
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:49,618
and begin to talk about things familiar
and then from familiar to intimate,

773
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,994
what's going on? And it's something
that I hoped, and do hope,

774
00:54:56,084 --> 00:55:02,797
is occurring subtly within the audience,
almost subconsciously.

775
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,672
I'd prefer it to be they're not actually
aware that this question's being asked,

776
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:09,925
but that it produces a state of openness

777
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,140
to wondering what's gonna happen
with these two men.

778
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:16,845
Because the wondering
what's gonna happen is actually not

779
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:20,978
whether or not Max is gonna live or die
or Vincent's gonna live or die.

780
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,605
It's about, "What is this relationship?"

781
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:02,686
Fanning has linked the victims together,

782
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,610
SO we have a situation
in which Fanning, that is, the LAPD,

783
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,439
knows there's linkage among victims.

784
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,996
Meanwhile, we cut back
to Max and Vincent.

785
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:24,125
And this is the first time Vincent
will digress with Max into familiarity,

786
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,296
as if these are two guys in a bar

787
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,545
who've known each other
for a couple of months.

788
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,592
And they're talking about their father.

789
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,229
And Max talks about his mother.

790
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:49,855
This is a design by which this subtext
of the two men impacting on each other

791
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,236
actually begins to take over
and start to drive the story.

792
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,739
And for it to do that,
it has to begin early on,

793
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,866
where you start to see
there's certain anomalies

794
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,992
in Vincent's behaviour.

795
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,828
Where he's not
the machine-like presence he was

796
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:01,954
at the beginning of the film,

797
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,126
but that there's deviations
that are happening.

798
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:07,662
So you get the sense something else
is going on with this guy tonight.

799
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:23,061
Now, this is the truth,
but Vincent doesn't play it for truth.

800
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,912
And, again, this is a moment that I think,

801
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:49,168
I believe, that Tom just absolutely hits
a very difficult thing to nail,

802
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,967
which is that Vincent is brilliant

803
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:58,673
and he knows how easily shocked
is petit bourgeois Max

804
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:05,514
and that he says things
to absolutely horrify and appall Max.

805
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,520
And when Max delivers the reaction,
Vincent laughs it off

806
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,476
and says he's kidding.

807
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,990
And now they're talking
about Island Limos

808
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:19,526
and the rationalizations Max has
about why it hasn't been started yet.

809
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:38,383
So Max has evolved
and refined this ideation

810
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:43,343
of this exalted, ephemeral state
of riding in a limo, in Island Limos,

811
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:46,680
to such an elevated experience

812
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,481
that it's not only impractical,
it's never gonna happen.

813
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:53,653
And all this was shot
in the refineries of Wilmington,

814
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,231
which is near the Port of Los Angeles.

815
00:58:56,324 --> 00:59:00,283
In Wilmington, there are clubs like this.

816
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,110
Why anybody would want to locate
a club there, I don't know.

817
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:02,157
Why anybody would want to locate
a club there, I don't know.

818
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:05,660
The El Rodeo disco
that the following scene is shot in

819
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,288
is not in, actually, Wilmington.

820
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,584
It's in Pico Rivera,
and we did nothing to this place.

821
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,215
And the difficulty
in scenes like this sometimes,

822
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:28,271
and in which Jamie does a wonderful job,

823
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,471
Is to maintain,

824
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,059
sometimes three months after
the beginning of principal photography,

825
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:36,487
that pure line of exactly his character,

826
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:40,191
of what
the character's circumstances are.

827
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,074
Because the night, in fiction,
is only two hours old,

828
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:48,533
and the circumstances are
that he's being asked to do

829
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:52,291
some preposterously outrageous,
difficult task,

830
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,793
which is to go into this club
and pretend that he's Vincent

831
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,339
and impersonate Vincent.

832
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,556
And the perplexed confusion, as Jamie...

833
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:17,612
As Max has to try and process a task
of which he's completely incapable.

834
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,781
Those circumstances, keeping those alive

835
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,406
and keeping those present
after you've been playing Max,

836
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,658
and we shoot all the scenes
out of order anyway,

837
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,830
so it may be, you know, two months later,

838
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,828
not two hours into the evening,

839
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:35,163
is what Jamie's achieving here
and what he's able to do.

840
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:39,592
And it's an innocent look in his eyes
as he turns and looks at Vincent.

841
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,890
We're about to see Klea Scott,

842
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:58,228
who was a regular
on Robbery Homicide Division.

843
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,111
She's a fine actress who trained

844
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,110
at the North Carolina School
of Performing Arts.

845
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,488
And Bruce McGill,
who I've worked with a couple of times.

846
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:08,162
He was terrific playing the attorney,
Ron Motley, in The Insider

847
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:11,161
and did a well-remembered episode
of Miami Vice

848
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,242
called
"Out Where the Buses Don't Run."

849
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,673
What you're seeing
is exactly what appears,

850
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,424
including the security guards
in the front,

851
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,927
who are the real security guards
at the real El Rodeo,

852
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,009
and really nice performances.

853
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,186
Particularly by this guy, Cosme,
who's gonna be the guy

854
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,729
on the left with the bald head.

855
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,023
And most everybody in the place
are regulars.

856
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,523
It's a Nortefo disco,
the people are from northern Mexico,

857
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:44,027
the music has got
a heavy polka influence.

858
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,950
And we substituted Calexico
and a couple of other bands.

859
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,625
And Max doesn't know
what he's getting into.

860
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,803
One of the things that intrigued me
about Stuart Beattie's script

861
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:15,479
was the way the storylines intersect.

862
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,683
They're held in a very disciplined way.

863
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,189
Discrete, each in its own channel.

864
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,115
And we're about to see
two of them collide,

865
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:31,241
as the shadowy,
silhouetted figures we established

866
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,073
coming into the FBI surveillance

867
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,331
are, in fact,
revealed to be Fanning and Weidner,

868
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,164
who have information
that is specifically, is and only is,

869
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,216
that there's a linkage between victims.

870
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,511
Not who the victims are
or how they network together,

871
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,055
or who's responsible for killing them.

872
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:06,113
And somebody told Pedrosa,
played by Bruce McGill,

873
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,281
to cooperate with these guys
and talk to them,

874
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:11,611
and he's totally reluctant to
and is stiffing them.

875
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,399
But Fanning spotted the cab
and noticed it was the cab

876
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,398
described in the alley behind Ramone's

877
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,357
and launches them
on a voyage of discovery

878
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:53,490
that's gonna result in the convergence
of these two vectors.

879
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,992
And what's nice about Beattie's script
is the way,

880
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,541
once we know the vectors
are going to converge, he leaps ahead,

881
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:04,121
and the next time we go back
to the surveillance location,

882
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:08,129
Beattie leaps ahead
to the convergence already happened

883
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,337
and just takes us
right into the important part of it,

884
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,422
which is the conclusion.

885
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:18,727
And there's a great poster
for LA's famous Que Buena Radio.

886
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,978
And El Rodeo on the interior is black-lit,

887
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:30,110
and these are the actual murals
on their walls.

888
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,864
And these are some
of the actual security guards there.

889
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:37,162
A couple other of these guys
playing security guards

890
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,831
are some folks we got
on a work-release programme

891
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:42,376
from LA County Jail.

892
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:49,175
Here's Javier Bardem playing Felix,
and it's a case of a brilliant actor

893
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:53,341
who invests himself totally in a role
even though it was two days' shooting.

894
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,513
Javier is Spanish,
and he spent two or three weeks

895
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,056
learning how to speak English
with a Mexican,

896
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,850
as opposed to a Spanish, accent.

897
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,449
And the two story tracks
between the LAPD and the FBI

898
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,369
have converged, and now their information

899
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,450
is actually revealed to us,

900
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,535
'cause we have not known,
up to this point,

901
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,582
who these people are
who are being killed,

902
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,036
which is very unusual
when you think about it.

903
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,588
We're engaged in a picture
in which Vincent is killing people,

904
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:32,544
and he's taken captive Max,
who's compelled to go along with him.

905
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:39,266
And we don't know

906
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,639
why the people who are being killed
are being killed.

907
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:46,223
They're obviously crimes of dispassion.
Vincent is indifferent.

908
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:50,561
And we're gonna discover later
that Vincent isn't even sure

909
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,113
why they're being killed.

910
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,317
So the way the information is marshalled,

911
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,153
the way it's moved around,
and where it's revealed

912
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:03,957
is fascinating to me, and it enhances,
for me, the sense of immediacy,

913
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,375
because when you are immediately
in the moment of something,

914
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,084
you don't know the back-story.
You don't know the context.

915
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:12,633
You don't know everything
about where people came from.

916
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,589
You're just occupied
with the "right now" of it.

917
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:23,302
And that's what appealed to me
about doing this film was that,

918
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:26,434
"Could I make a motion picture
in which I can engage the audience

919
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,812
"in the 'right now' of it
without a lot of history,

920
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:32,315
"without a lot of exposition,
so that it kind of, in a way,

921
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,443
"almost simulates our experience
of the present

922
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,615
"when we're put in a context
we don't know?"

923
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,198
We don't know the circumstance,
we don't know exactly where we are.

924
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:43,201
The landscape may be
somewhat foreign to us.

925
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,326
And so we have less answers
than we have answers.

926
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,206
And as that...

927
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:53,916
The impressions impact upon us,
one after the other, in sequence,

928
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:58,846
some of that experience,
that's what I wanted to...

929
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:02,846
That's what attracted me
to tell this story, because it did that.

930
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,928
It had that immediacy to it.
I found that very exciting.

931
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,982
The degree of difficulty of this scene
for an actor is rather high,

932
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:22,570
because what Jamie has to do is
he has to pull off that he is Max

933
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,826
and he, playing Max,

934
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,578
has to have Max play that Max is Vincent,

935
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,535
and with believability,

936
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:34,248
so that you believe that it's
credible enough for Felix to buy.

937
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:37,175
And that's hard to do.

938
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:42,428
Behind all that, and why this is pivotal
in the realization of Max's character,

939
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,758
it has to do
with this massive compression

940
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:50,313
of Max's life to this single point,
this single fine point in time

941
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,684
in which Max believes he's gonna die.

942
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,451
And there's the moment of truth for Max.

943
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:39,568
And faced with mortality,
what emerges is,

944
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:45,243
in fact, the power, the skill,
the improvisational ability

945
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,617
to speak his mind, to take action.

946
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:51,826
It's okay that it manifests itself
in mimicry. He's imitating Vincent.

947
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,290
And that's okay, 'cause that's actually
how our learning process...

948
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,836
As human beings, that's how we learn.

949
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,273
We mimic something,
and then we make it our own.

950
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:16,187
And that's exactly what the idea
of this was.

951
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:19,019
But he had to have that experience

952
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:23,573
as his jumping-off point,
as a catalyst of, "He's gonna die."

953
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:28,950
And it comes from Felix
telling this anecdote

954
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,453
he probably just made up
about Black Peter.

955
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:07,735
Felix is surrounded by a ring
of security people around him,

956
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:12,369
and he is also surrounded
by sharply-pointed plants,

957
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:16,167
and it was... I wasn't happy with the set,

958
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,291
and we couldn't really change anything
on the walls,

959
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,090
and so we just improvised
and brought in a bunch of plants.

960
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,479
This is an interesting scene to me,
in terms of audience reactions,

961
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:41,481
because for some reason,
some audiences get

962
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:45,986
that Max is offering Felix a big discount

963
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,859
on Vincent's fees.

964
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:52,491
That he's giving away
a whole bunch of Vincent's money.

965
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:56,416
And some audiences think
this is actually hilarious.

966
01:10:56,502 --> 01:11:00,587
And for some reason, other audiences,
it just goes right past them

967
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:05,167
and it doesn't get any kind of a reaction.

968
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:12,637
The colour right here
is just something that happened.

969
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:16,516
Just the composition, the light.
This is actually shot on film, this piece.

970
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,348
And we just managed to preserve it.

971
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,772
What's happened here
was very challenging for me

972
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:32,953
from a storytelling point of view,
or actually the plot point of view.

973
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:40,085
Because the information deficit
that each discrete track had,

974
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,334
i.e. the FBI knew nothing,

975
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,381
the LAPD knew that bodies were dropping

976
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:46,504
and they were linked,

977
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:50,053
and then, also, we're about to generate
Paco and Rubio,

978
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:55,259
have all come together
in the FBI surveillance scene.

979
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:59,062
And the FBI and the LAPD now know

980
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,981
that the bodies are dropping,
are all linked together,

981
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,313
and that, in fact,
they're the FBI's witnesses

982
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:07,646
who were about to come forward
in a federal grand jury

983
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,790
that's supposed to be convening tomorrow.

984
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:23,166
This was an abandoned Kmart,
and it was the largest...

985
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:26,169
I think it was the largest Kmart
in America,

986
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:30,298
and it was transformed into this set
by a very talented art director.

987
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:31,632
It was a very long night.

988
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:35,181
And we wound up working very fast,
and it was very late in the night.

989
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:39,762
And sometimes when you do that,
there's a real tremendous intensity.

990
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:43,315
And if you could keep that on a roll,
you get some of the best work because,

991
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,814
as an actor and also as a director,
it's just happening so fast,

992
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,154
there's a certain spontaneous intensity
to it.

993
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,197
And Mark Ruffalo, particularly,

994
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,700
I believe, really shined in this.

995
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:21,929
What's happening is that Klea Scott
is identifying for us

996
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,934
the origins of Vincent.

997
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,727
The FBI are poised
as kind of unguided missiles

998
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,857
or misguided missiles,

999
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,656
because they now have identified,
because of Vincent's ploy,

1000
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,610
that they believe Max to be Vincent.

1001
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,827
Fanning is skeptical.

1002
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,683
This is Tom Rothrock's cue.

1003
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:15,073
Most of the composing
is done by James Newton Howard,

1004
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,445
who did excellent work,

1005
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:20,403
particularly a very, very difficult piece
towards the end of the film,

1006
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:23,490
which is alternately orchestral
and percussion.

1007
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,955
But this particular piece
is composed by Rothrock,

1008
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:30,630
whose strength
is this kind of blues mode,

1009
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:31,797
which you're hearing right here.

1010
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,502
He also did the cue that opens the movie.

1011
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:38,839
And I view music
as telling different parts of the story,

1012
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,720
so sometimes
just as you have multiple characters,

1013
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,054
you should have different,

1014
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,603
slightly different perspectives
on the music all fitting into a plan

1015
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:48,478
about how the story ought to tell itself.

1016
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:56,315
There's four story tracks
all heading to a disco named Fever.

1017
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:58,070
Max and Vincent are heading there.

1018
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,654
And there's kind of a sense of
destiny's gonna get worked out

1019
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,115
in this confrontation,
and there's a prelude,

1020
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:08,952
in which something
I found fascinating was to happen.

1021
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,844
Vincent changes registers again,

1022
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:31,775
and I wanted Vincent to just elevate
without any transition

1023
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:35,861
into a state of mind
in which he was speaking to Max

1024
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:38,485
as if they were brothers
or if they were pals

1025
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,988
who've known each other for 15 years,
and they're in a bar

1026
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,949
and Vincent's just saying
this most casual thing,

1027
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,406
"Hey, why aren't you gonna ask
that girl out?"

1028
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:02,426
With a familiarity that's schizophrenic,

1029
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:06,054
that has no basis at all
in the circumstances

1030
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:09,433
that Vincent has, in fact,
imposed upon Max.

1031
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:12,891
It's a step aside from reality
into a parallel reality,

1032
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,897
the reality that's going on
in Vincent's mind,

1033
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,820
which is also the subtext of the film.

1034
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:18,692
That Vincent's, in fact, cracking up.

1035
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,736
That Vincent's, in fact, cracking up.

1036
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,194
That subtext is gonna wind up
hijacking the whole of the story

1037
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,949
and drive us to the end.

1038
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,874
And after he asks this question,
each man kind of retreats

1039
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,578
into the solitude
of his own self-awareness.

1040
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:39,426
And what they see is something
that I witnessed a couple of times in LA.

1041
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,761
I was driving a babysitter home
and saw three coyotes

1042
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,386
who were just walking diagonally
across the intersection

1043
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,592
of Fairfax and Sunset Boulevard.

1044
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,807
They seemed to have an attitude
like they still owned it,

1045
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,604
this was still their real estate.

1046
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,682
And this civilized layer
called the City of Los Angeles,

1047
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,610
which has only been here for 80 years
was, in fact, something temporary.

1048
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,687
Maybe here, maybe gone tomorrow.

1049
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:04,734
And each man thinking his own thoughts

1050
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:08,288
as he's heading into
what may be mortal combat.

1051
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,635
When I heard this song by Audioslave

1052
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:31,094
and the Chris Cornell vocal,
Shadow On The Sun,

1053
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,771
I knew I wanted it
for this moment in the film.

1054
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:38,648
As they travel through
the neon shopping malls of Koreatown,

1055
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,525
the advantage of the video,

1056
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:44,612
shooting in high-def, is the ability
to see these distant landscapes

1057
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,613
and trees against the sky,

1058
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,992
almost as if we're in
some kind of a dark afternoon.

1059
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,695
The club is a club...
The real name of the club is Bliss.

1060
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:25,739
It's on Sixth in Wilshire Central
in Koreatown.

1061
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,612
We renamed it Fever.

1062
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:32,580
And we actually enter the real location,

1063
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:36,284
and we duplicated the decor
on a set that we built

1064
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,415
that had to be seven times as large.

1065
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:40,087
Seven or eight times
as large as the actual club

1066
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,210
Seven or eight times
as large as the actual club

1067
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:45,259
to fit the 800 or 900 Korean extras
we brought in.

1068
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:55,687
What's happening
is that all the discrete storylines

1069
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:59,892
are heading towards a collision,
and we, the audience, are aware of it.

1070
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,319
Vincent, the hunter, is not aware
that he's, in fact, being hunted.

1071
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,989
The challenge of shooting I,
and the excitement about shooting it,

1072
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:10,990
was to set up each character

1073
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,745
moving through this field of 800 dancers

1074
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:19,122
in a way so that we were with each group

1075
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:20,374
as they're moving through it

1076
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,376
and knowing where we are at the same time

1077
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,003
and keeping all three stories alive.

1078
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:30,638
The music is Ready Steady Go
by Paul Oakenfold.

1079
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:34,262
It's a great piece.
It was perfect for this scene.

1080
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:36,060
But to make it be less familiar,

1081
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,888
we translated Ready Steady Go
into Korean,

1082
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,226
soO, what they're saying in Korean
IS, "Ready, steady, go."

1083
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,402
Koreatown has the largest population
of Koreans outside of Seoul.

1084
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:50,279
And as a community,
it's particularly vibrant and unified

1085
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,451
and has a great depth of culture,

1086
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:57,624
which is kind of typical of Los Angeles
and ethnic communities in Los Angeles,

1087
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,747
where there seems to be
a lot less assimilation.

1088
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,124
So that in going to a Korean club,

1089
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,706
you're gonna see music videos from Seoul.

1090
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,259
You're not gonna see music videos
from MTV.

1091
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,596
The way I thought about this whole scene,

1092
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:16,847
in terms of scene analysis, like,
"How does the scene work internally?"

1093
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:21,647
Is that, it's a conflict between
our characters, Max and Vincent,

1094
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:25,443
and then also Pedrosa,
when we're tracking with Pedrosa.

1095
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:29,523
And what he's in conflict with is,
in fact, chaos.

1096
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:34,861
And it's the chaos
that Vincent has to work against

1097
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,946
to achieve his objective.

1098
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,498
Which is, of course,
completely pathological,

1099
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,751
which is to murder a Korean gangster
named Peter Lim.

1100
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:04,311
A lot of the close-quarter combat
that Vincent is doing, again,

1101
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,188
took three to four months of training.

1102
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:10,442
And we did a much broader variety of it

1103
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,902
than what we're seeing here.

1104
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:17,908
But Tom was very fast and very strong,
very skilled with this.

1105
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:21,332
And the instructor I used is Mick Gould,

1106
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,206
who was one of the two instructors I had

1107
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:27,630
for all the close-quarter combat
that we did.

1108
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,211
And the other guy was Andy McNab,

1109
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:34,341
who was also the author
of a book called Bravo Two Zero,

1110
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,014
which is highly recommended reading
on the first Iraq war,

1111
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:40,093
that he was in
and was captured by the Iraqis.

1112
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:46,058
Lim has an outer ring of protection,

1113
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,189
which is exactly
the way security would behave.

1114
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,777
And then he's got
some closer people around him.

1115
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,450
There were two classes of security,

1116
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:58,532
one with bodyguards, trained bodyguards,

1117
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,740
and then some Korean gangsters
who didn't speak English.

1118
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,953
And why they don't speak English
is something that's gonna be

1119
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:07,662
seen in a moment.

1120
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:15,257
The Korean gangsters behind Lim
now mistake the FBI,

1121
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,760
who are, in fact,
coming to bring Lim to safety.

1122
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,013
They mistake it as an assault on Lim.

1123
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,012
They don't speak English.

1124
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,390
Pedrosa gets shot.

1125
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:36,817
That instantly initiates panic and chaos,

1126
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:40,904
and now Vincent is not just having
to move through a field of dancers

1127
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,456
to get closer to Lim,

1128
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:47,957
he now has to move through, in fact,
a gunfight and the chaos and the panic

1129
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,458
and a mob stampeding to get away.

1130
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:56,461
We had an admirable group
of Korean extras

1131
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:59,138
recruited from Koreatown, from UCLA,

1132
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,595
from all kinds of places,
who managed to work themselves up

1133
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:05,428
into a state of panic
for about 12 to 14 hours a day

1134
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,729
for about five days straight.

1135
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:12,814
Vincent, in reality,
would be really focused

1136
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,818
on what's happening.
Almost like a fugue state.

1137
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:19,151
And then it's gonna get interrupted
by a threat to Max,

1138
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,281
and as Vincent deals with it,

1139
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,783
I wanted Tom to have,
and he absolutely has,

1140
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:28,539
a kind of look on his face,
almost as if he's irritated

1141
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:31,121
because Max has been so inconsiderate

1142
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,460
to allow himself
to have his life jeopardised,

1143
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,383
and Vincent's had to intervene
to save him.

1144
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,638
The only guy who is headed right,

1145
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:44,513
because he, in fact,
has really proper procedure

1146
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:48,062
as a detective and investigator,
is Fanning.

1147
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:52,316
And he's finally able to rescue Max.

1148
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:59,444
He sets up the unexpected.

1149
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,988
Vincent, right here in this scene,
is disarmed,

1150
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:08,871
and it's actually his weakest moment
in the film.

1151
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:14,081
He rises to the occasion
and continues doing what he does.

1152
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:32,144
But the point was that Vincent had
a moment of confusion.

1153
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:36,189
And it's one of the other subtle glimpses

1154
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,239
into what's going on
below the surface of Vincent's activity.

1155
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:44,569
And in my mind, and this is strictly
from the director's perspective,

1156
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,620
meaning that the audience
didn't necessarily

1157
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,698
get impacted upon these things.

1158
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,204
In my mind, it was that...

1159
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,832
It's almost as if Vincent's 11 years old
for an instant,

1160
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,788
for a fraction of a second,

1161
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:59,876
and he's confused by bad things
that are happening to him.

1162
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:05,261
And he responds by reassembling
his perspective in reacting

1163
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,808
and acting out with violent aggression.

1164
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:12,104
Now, the audience may or may not only
get a moment of weakness from him,

1165
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,479
but it was fundamental to me
in my understanding of Vincent's history

1166
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:21,440
and his character that this, in fact, is
something that's repeated into his life.

1167
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:28,529
Now, what Jamie was supposed to do was...

1168
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,537
His door was open,
and he was supposed to be

1169
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,127
so distracted by the seemingly eternal

1170
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,167
so distracted by the seemingly eternal

1171
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,791
situation he finds himself in,

1172
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,798
meaning that regardless of what happens,

1173
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,176
he winds up back behind the wheel
on the seat of that cab,

1174
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:49,258
that he just accelerated forward
without closing the door,

1175
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:52,471
and the door is to bang
into the parked car.

1176
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:56,398
That didn't happen. The door closed,
and Jamie just headed for the car.

1177
01:25:56,485 --> 01:26:00,399
We're into something called "Scene 86"

1178
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:06,784
and it's the big, pivotal scene
in the construction of the story.

1179
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,328
Max has been changed
by a number of things that happen,

1180
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:13,624
starting with the compression of his life,

1181
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:16,168
facing death in the form of Felix.

1182
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,337
My direction to Jamie
for that scene was that,

1183
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,588
"You have to feel like you're gonna die.
You're gonna die right now."

1184
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,636
And Max manifested individual action
for the first time,

1185
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,965
which was always there.
It had been latent instead of manifest.

1186
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,053
And in the scene with Felix,

1187
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:33,181
it took the form
of actually mimicking Vincent's style

1188
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:35,683
when he talks about / Ching, Darwin.

1189
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:40,735
But between then, with Felix,
and right now, Max is changed.

1190
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:45,190
And right now, Max sees
beyond the end of Vincent's gun

1191
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,695
to the man who is there.

1192
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:49,281
Vincent's repeating a pattern,

1193
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:52,739
and he again delivers
the kind of facile nihilism

1194
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,665
about the purposelessness of the cosmos.

1195
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,122
"Nothing means anything,
so what difference does it make

1196
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,082
"how many bodies are dropped tonight?"

1197
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,335
This is the third time
we've heard this from Vincent,

1198
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:05,043
and so there's almost
a kind of a self-directed cynicism.

1199
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,377
He calls it "crap."”

1200
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:18,981
But this time, Max doesn't buy it.
And Max sees through it.

1201
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:47,381
Every film seems to have
its pivotal scenes,

1202
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:52,216
and this is the pivotal scene
of this motion picture.

1203
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:56,644
Max, for the first time,
is seeing beyond the end of the gun

1204
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,722
and is seeing Vincent for who Vincent is,

1205
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,682
which is damaged goods.

1206
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:05,857
He experiences a feeling
of an understanding for Vincent,

1207
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,564
and he struggles to put it into words.

1208
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:15,450
And that struggle is something

1209
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:20,535
I very much wanted Jamie to live through,

1210
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,711
and that is Vincent's sociopathy,

1211
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,293
that even if you put a gun
to his head and told Vincent,

1212
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,753
"Il have to shoot you
unless you can tell me

1213
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:27,879
"what somebody over there is feeling,"

1214
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:30,586
Vincent can't do it.
He isn't capable of empathy.

1215
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,298
He's literally incapable of it,
as if he were handicapped.

1216
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:47,444
So Max renders a negative judgment
on Vincent.

1217
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,818
He says,
"You are low, my brother. Way low."

1218
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,610
Vincent is actually not impervious,

1219
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:57,162
he's not the Teflon man
we saw landing at LAX.

1220
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,081
He's injured by this.

1221
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:05,504
And he assaults Max reactively.

1222
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:10,960
And it's very personal,
and his intent is to devastate Max

1223
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:14,467
with a prediction of the purposelessness

1224
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,515
of what Max's life will be,

1225
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,434
almost as if Vincent
is the Ghost of Christmas Future,

1226
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:24,482
and telling him
that Max's evasion is chronic,

1227
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:28,027
and he'll never achieve
any of his dreams.

1228
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:03,896
In this scene right here, I can't fail

1229
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:08,977
but to have a director's appreciation
for actors,

1230
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,777
"cause fine acting is fine acting,

1231
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:14,528
and it's not something
directors really do,

1232
01:30:14,618 --> 01:30:16,575
except notable exceptions
like John Huston.

1233
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:21,371
But we have the highest, at least,
I have the highest regard for it,

1234
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:25,668
because it is that projection
out onto the end of the limb.

1235
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,165
Or on the wire without a net.

1236
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:31,874
It's, you know,
going through that ineffable place

1237
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:37,880
where you're simultaneously in control
and completely uncontrolled,

1238
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,511
living, breathing
and being in the moment.

1239
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,936
And I think that's what Jamie Foxx
and Tom Cruise are doing right here.

1240
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:50,314
And it never ceases
to be marvelous to me.

1241
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:07,830
Max has taken what Vincent said earlier
and stood it on its head,

1242
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:11,915
which is to say that
if existence has no inherent meaning,

1243
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:16,297
and it's meaningless,
then, in fact, the individual is free

1244
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:18,383
to put meaning into his life
by his actions.

1245
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,259
And Max takes action.

1246
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:37,277
Max rebels,
and he's about to destroy what, in fact,

1247
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,449
has imprisoned him for the last 12 years.

1248
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:04,759
In flipping the cab, I designed the shot

1249
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:08,141
and how many times I wanted the cab
to flip and how I wanted it to end up.

1250
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:12,976
And the physics of it
are pretty interesting.

1251
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,439
You weight the cab in certain parts,

1252
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,362
and you lift the back of the cab
with kind of an air mortar.

1253
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:22,319
And you just actually run the left front
of the cab into a piece of concrete,

1254
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:25,655
and physics do the rest.

1255
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:31,206
Joel Kramer, the stunt coordinator,
and the stuntmen who worked on this

1256
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,004
are pretty much able to dump the cab
exactly where we want,

1257
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:37,082
and we went out to an abandoned airstrip

1258
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:41,717
and set up this course
with exactly the right distances.

1259
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:45,390
And the cab dropped
where it was supposed to that day,

1260
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,219
and it also dropped
where it was supposed to this day.

1261
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:52,728
There were about nine cameras there,
but the key camera is the last one,

1262
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:57,353
the camera in which the cab
actually comes to a stop,

1263
01:32:57,447 --> 01:33:00,405
after it lifts the front
end of this Pontiac.

1264
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:04,030
And this is take one.
They just hit it, and they nailed it.

1265
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,737
I've reviewed it on the monitors,

1266
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,119
and because of the higher contrast
on the monitors,

1267
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:13,373
it made it seem as if the crash
was actually more kinetic than it was.

1268
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,921
And I thought it was too violent.

1269
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:19,750
So we re-shot it, I think, two more times.

1270
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,256
Didn't need any of it. The first take,

1271
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,679
with the multiple cameras,
is the one we used.

1272
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:33,435
This is Bob Deamer.
Bob Deamer is an officer in the LAPD.

1273
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:37,268
And I've gone on a number
of ride-alongs with him,

1274
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:39,399
in which we've had various adventures.

1275
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:43,198
And contrary to his appearance here,
he's a very tough cop.

1276
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,715
Jamie's so weary of life with Vincent

1277
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,715
that being taken to LA County Jail
sounds like a good idea.

1278
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:11,310
This begins a music cue
by James Newton Howard

1279
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:16,186
that's going to alternate
between orchestral,

1280
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:19,064
with the horns and low strings,

1281
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:23,739
meaning cellos, violas,

1282
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:25,941
double bass

1283
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:30,495
and a horn section and percussion.

1284
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:33,244
And it begins here,
and it's an extremely long cue.

1285
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:36,747
Goes for almost 16 or 17 minutes,
taken in total.

1286
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:39,956
It was written and composed
as a unified cue.

1287
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:43,792
And that was
some of the fascinating dynamics

1288
01:34:43,887 --> 01:34:46,595
of the construction of this narrative
for those of us who made the film.

1289
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,635
Of the construction of this narrative
for those of us who made the film.

1290
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:52,013
Because it's immediate
and because it takes place in 10 hours,

1291
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:55,221
that means you examine
smaller pieces of time

1292
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:58,774
under a very powerful microscope,
which means that events

1293
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:02,694
which normally, in a normal film,
might occupy two and a half minutes,

1294
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,737
in this film occupy five minutes,

1295
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:08,362
because we examine them
much more closely.

1296
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:11,199
And so, consequently, music cues
that would be two or three minutes,

1297
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:13,827
which are more conventional,
become five and six minute cues

1298
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:17,376
or, in this case, a long cue
becomes a hugely long cue.

1299
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:51,785
The visualization that you're seeing
in some of these shots of Jamie

1300
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:55,409
on the rooftop are interesting,
because they would not be possible

1301
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,959
with motion-picture film.
Those buildings are not lit.

1302
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:02,880
There's, I think,
one parking-structure light

1303
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:05,549
that's on Jamie, and that's about it.

1304
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,314
If I had shot
on 35 mm motion-picture film,

1305
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:24,894
I would have had to use
a lot of very powerful lights,

1306
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,025
and then it wouldn't have had
a realistic look.

1307
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:28,902
It would have looked like
it was, in fact, lit.

1308
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:31,950
So it was... Cityscapes like this

1309
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:36,371
are one of the key reasons
I wanted to shoot in high-def video,

1310
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:40,826
because it revealed the whole world
of the city at night.

1311
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:06,269
That's also apparent in the scene
when Vincent kicks in the door,

1312
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:10,856
and you're seeing the detail
of the exterior and the depth of field,

1313
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:13,112
meaning things in the foreground
are in focus

1314
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:16,786
and things in the deep background
are also in focus,

1315
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:18,739
including the distant lights.

1316
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:14,211
Here's more of the lights
that we're seeing

1317
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:18,344
only as a courtesy
of high-definition video.

1318
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:38,952
This shot would also have been
impossible in motion-picture film.

1319
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,905
Max would either be not exposed at all,

1320
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:44,832
and/or he would not be able
to carry the focus.

1321
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:51,624
This rooftop that Max is on
was a very, very difficult...

1322
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:56,302
Probably the most difficult location
for us to get permission to shoot on

1323
01:38:56,389 --> 01:39:00,758
in the city, because it's controlled
by the Secret Service.

1324
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:04,595
And they use it to park vehicles on
from time to time,

1325
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:08,728
and they don't want anybody
even remotely near the rooftop.

1326
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:11,560
And it took a lot of convincing

1327
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:14,066
and us willing to work
under mass restrictions,

1328
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:18,526
meaning we shot all of Max's work
in about two hours.

1329
01:39:20,246 --> 01:39:23,455
That's the only way we were able
to get permission to be on this rooftop.

1330
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:25,953
It's the only exposed
rooftop quite like it

1331
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:29,456
in downtown Los Angeles,
which was why I needed it.

1332
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:13,455
The drums were originally heard
in Mozambique.

1333
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,711
In Maputo, Mozambique on AIL.

1334
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:18,919
When I heard them in Maputo,
I recorded them,

1335
01:40:19,013 --> 01:40:23,849
and then we got Ghanaian drummers,
who happened to be in Los Angeles,

1336
01:40:23,935 --> 01:40:27,803
to go into the third level
of my parking garage.

1337
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:30,184
It's got a lot of echo in it.

1338
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:35,485
And we repeated the drumming pattern
I had heard in East Africa

1339
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:37,528
with drummers
who were mostly from West Africa.

1340
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:38,985
We call them Ghanaian drums.

1341
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:42,693
In fact, they're Mozambican drums,
if you like.

1342
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:44,277
And we sampled those.

1343
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:47,285
We also repeated it
and did them mostly live.

1344
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,866
This scene,
without being able to use digital video,

1345
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:34,919
would not even have been able
to have been written, much less shot,

1346
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,714
because you wouldn't even conceive

1347
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,418
of a scene in which characters
are moving around with no lights

1348
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:44,634
and, in fact, it's only their silhouettes
against the city lights

1349
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:48,433
and a little bit of bounce that's coming
from the city lights themselves

1350
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:49,639
that enables you to see them.

1351
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:52,767
It just would've been
physically impossible to capture it.

1352
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,769
The cameras are seeing more
than the naked eye.

1353
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:58,227
When we finished some of these shots,
and I said, "Cut,"

1354
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:00,779
everybody had to stay where they were
until the lights were turned on

1355
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:04,358
so that people didn't trip and fall
and hurt themselves.

1356
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:06,822
Max grew up in Ladera Heights,

1357
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:09,574
Which is a very middle-class section
of Los Angeles.

1358
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:13,124
And he's never been exposed
to street violence, really, in his life,

1359
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:16,293
except what he might have seen
as a cab driver.

1360
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:21,007
So he doesn't know how to shoot
an H&K .45.

1361
01:42:52,875 --> 01:42:56,038
In doing some of the research
about what Vincent would've done

1362
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:57,835
if he walked in a strange building,

1363
01:42:57,922 --> 01:42:59,788
he would have, first of all,

1364
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:03,045
acclimated himself
to the ambient noise of the building.

1365
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:06,173
Buildings heat up during the day
when the sun's out.

1366
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:08,971
At night, they cool off and they contract,

1367
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:13,518
and thousands of contractions
throughout the entire structure

1368
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:15,595
give the building noise.

1369
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:22,982
And if you're quiet in a building,
and you listen, you could listen to it.

1370
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:25,404
And the point is
that what Vincent would've been doing

1371
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:28,734
and what he does here
is that he stops, and he listens.

1372
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,574
And he gets the ambient noise
that's supposed to be there.

1373
01:43:31,664 --> 01:43:32,908
Because what he's really listening for,

1374
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:34,243
once he understands
what the ambient noise

1375
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,370
that's supposed to be there is,
are the anomalous noises.

1376
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:41,421
And the anomalous noises
are the sounds of his prey

1377
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:43,214
and that's Annie.

1378
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:53,721
And all he's doing when he's static here
is, in fact, listening.

1379
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:58,271
And he's just almost kind of like a bat,
and he's listening for the sound.

1380
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:01,475
What he hears are her stockings

1381
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:03,773
scraping against the carpet

1382
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:06,696
and her palms
scraping against the carpet,

1383
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:08,989
and that's how he locates her.

1384
01:45:02,254 --> 01:45:05,497
It wasn't planned
that Vincent fall over the chair,

1385
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:06,672
but when he did,
it's one of those accidents that I love.

1386
01:45:06,675 --> 01:45:11,966
But when he did,
it's one of those accidents that I love.

1387
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:14,552
I love it when something happens
that's unexpected.

1388
01:45:14,642 --> 01:45:15,848
It's kind of an anomaly.

1389
01:45:19,772 --> 01:45:20,766
I sometimes ask myself,

1390
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:24,474
"What are the characteristics
of an event or an activity

1391
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,900
"that are gonna make it simulate
something real

1392
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,819
"or feel to me as if it's real?"

1393
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:32,615
And it's the things
that don't go exactly according to plan.

1394
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,576
I tend to be attracted to them.

1395
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:55,721
I was attracted to this location

1396
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:59,972
among all the different
MTA subway stations in Los Angeles,

1397
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:03,475
particularly because of the amount
of steel.

1398
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:07,605
I like the sense that they're running
into some place metallic,

1399
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:09,811
almost like a metallic tube.

1400
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:16,242
LA's got a pretty beautiful subway
and public-transportation system.

1401
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:20,367
And when it travels on the surface
and hits some of the train stops,

1402
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:24,200
many of them are one-offs.
They're individually architected.

1403
01:46:46,525 --> 01:46:50,109
Vincent is enraged.
He's impossibly formidable.

1404
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:57,155
Max surprised Vincent
and actually pulled the trigger,

1405
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:00,862
something that Vincent
thought Max incapable of doing.

1406
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:07,335
In his clumsy way,
Max has been improvisational,

1407
01:47:07,421 --> 01:47:10,084
which brings it back to a theme
that's actually defined

1408
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,461
in Stuart Beattie's script.

1409
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:17,507
In the jazz club,
when Vincent talks about improvisation

1410
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:20,009
and Max is acquiring

1411
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:23,760
certain characteristics
through the agency now,

1412
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:28,940
not of the advice of Vincent
but via his conflict with him.

1413
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:55,333
I didn't desire to ameliorate in any way
Vincent's intent.

1414
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,384
Vincent intends to kill Annie.

1415
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:01,260
And it was something
that I questioned one or two times

1416
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,345
and came to the conclusion
it has to be what happens.

1417
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:08,601
This is a spectacular MTA station
right above...

1418
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:11,308
Right amongst a conjunction
of three freeways.

1419
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:13,359
It's the Harbor Station.

1420
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:52,102
This is not a visual effect.
This is shot practically,

1421
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:56,231
as is all these other shots
of pulling out of the Harbor Station.

1422
01:48:56,321 --> 01:48:58,904
There are some shots
that are gonna be coming up

1423
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:02,200
in which I chose to shoot green screen,

1424
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:07,326
meaning that I wanted to be able
to customize the backgrounds

1425
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:09,623
that were outside the windows.

1426
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:12,618
Like right here.

1427
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:15,709
And the reason for it was because
I wanted the graphic pattern

1428
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:20,714
of particularly those rectangles of light,
which are from parking structures,

1429
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:23,262
and I wanted them to occur
right at this moment.

1430
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:31,767
Max has closed his eyes
and simply pulled the trigger,

1431
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,066
expecting to die
after he's forced himself,

1432
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:37,940
impelled himself to confront Vincent.

1433
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:50,907
There was a direction here,
the particular attitude

1434
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,417
for Vincent to have as he sat down.

1435
01:49:53,504 --> 01:49:55,745
And the direction was to be irritated.

1436
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:59,503
As if it was being irritated
at something pedestrian.

1437
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:04,178
And he's irritated
at the absurd outcome of this gunfight,

1438
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,222
at the whole of this night.

1439
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:10,767
Particularly about the gunfight.

1440
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:15,473
If Max hadn't closed his eyes
and just fired chaotically, he'd be dead.

1441
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:26,135
Vincent's ironically repeated
the same line,

1442
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,259
an anecdote about,
"A guy gets on the MTA, dies,

1443
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:30,555
"think anybody will notice?"

1444
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:33,134
But it's not a rhetorical question.

1445
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,020
Vincent is asking,

1446
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:40,725
"Will anybody note
that once upon a time I was here?"

1447
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:42,730
And he's sincere.

1448
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:48,863
All of Vincent's life, who he's been,
and all of Max's life,

1449
01:51:48,952 --> 01:51:51,694
it's all been collapsed
into this one moment.

1450
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:54,997
Into the events of this one night.

1451
01:51:55,083 --> 01:51:56,869
And the night's over.
