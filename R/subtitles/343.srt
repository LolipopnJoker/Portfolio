1
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,593
My name is
Captain James Tiberius Kirk

2
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,875
of the United Federation of Planets.

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,431
I am appearing before you
as a neutral representative

4
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,192
of the Fibonan Republic.

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,836
I bring you a message of goodwill

6
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,032
and present to you esteemed members
of the Teenaxi Delegation,

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,037
a gift from the Fibonan High Council
with the highest regard.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,713
What's wrong with it?

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Uh, excuse me?

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,351
Why don't they want it anymore?

11
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,591
Uh, well, this was once
a piece of an ancient weapon,

12
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,676
and now they offer it as a symbol of...

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,628
Of peace.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,314
In the Fibonan culture,

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,709
to surrender a weapon
is an offer of truce.

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,153
How did they come by it?

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,674
They told me
they acquired it a long time ago.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,194
So they stole it, then.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,271
No, they, um... Well, I don't know.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
You don't know the Fibonans like we do!

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,456
Yeah, that's very true.
Your Excellency, this gift...

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,074
They're a crowd of untrustworthy thieves

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,628
who want to see us murdered
in our own beds!

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,959
This beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace.

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,318
They want to chop us into pieces
and roast us over a fire!

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
No, no... I don't think that's true.

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,753
And eat us!

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
What?

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,915
Scotty! Get me out of here!

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,718
- That was quick.
- Scotty!

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,948
There's quite a bit
of surface interference, sir.

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,159
Scotty!

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Get it off of me!

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,316
I ripped my shirt again.

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,628
How'd it go?

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,959
Captain, did you manage
to broker a treaty with the Teenaxi?

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,315
Uh... Let's just say I came up short.

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,916
Will you, uh, log that and put it
in the vault, Spock? Thank you.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,672
Jim, you look like crap.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you, Bones.

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,918
You got that little vein popping out
of your temple again. You okay?

42
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,600
Never better!
Just another day in the fleet.

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,194
Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2.

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,592
Today is our 966th day in deep space,

45
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,831
a little under three years
into our five-year mission.

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,313
The more time we spend out here,

47
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,237
the harder it is to tell
where one day ends

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,872
and the next one begins.

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,035
It can be a challenge to feel grounded
when even gravity is artificial.

50
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,112
But, well, we do what we can
to make it feel like home.

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,114
The crew, as always,
continues to act admirably

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,829
despite the rigors of our extended stay
here in outer space.

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,912
And the personal sacrifices
they have made.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,296
We continue to search
for new life forms

55
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,471
in order to establish firm diplomatic ties.

56
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,918
Our extended time in uncharted territory

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,275
has stretched the ship's
mechanical capacities.

58
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,675
But fortunately
our engineering department,

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,832
led by Mr. Scott,
is more than up to the job.

60
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,789
The ship aside,
prolonged cohabitation has

61
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,236
definitely had effects
on interpersonal dynamics.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,549
Some experiences for the better,

63
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,835
and some for the worse.

64
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,796
As for me, things have started to feel
a little episodic.

65
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,238
The farther out we go,
the more I find myself wondering

66
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,436
what it is we're trying to accomplish.

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,753
If the universe is truly endless,

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,078
then are we not striving
for something forever out of reach?

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,675
The Enterprise is scheduled
for a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown,

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,911
the Federation's newest
and most advanced starbase.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,356
Perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,113
from the mysteries of the unknown.

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,359
Sorry I'm late.

74
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,557
Keenser's leaking
some kind of highly acidic green goo,

75
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,108
and Scotty's terrified
he's gonna sneeze on the warp core

76
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
and kill us all.

77
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,711
What the hell are you drinking?

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,560
Uh, I'm pretty sure
it's the rest of that Saurian brandy

79
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,789
we picked up on Thasus.

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,350
My God, man, are you trying to go blind?

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,632
That stuff's illegal.

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,996
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
- Wow.
- Right?

84
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,159
I mean, I always assumed he'd be

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,998
- a vodka man.
- A vodka guy, exactly.

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,113
I wanted to have
something appropriate for your birthday.

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,352
Uh, that's in a couple days.
You know I don't care about that.

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,079
I know. I know you don't like
celebrating it on the day

89
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,674
because it's also the day
your pa bit the dust.

90
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,795
I was being sensitive.

91
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,799
Did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school?

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,670
It's just your southern charm.

93
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,792
- Oh, yeah. That's good.
- Ooh.

94
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Lordy!

95
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,517
Are you gonna call your mom?

96
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,070
Yeah, of course. I'll call her on the day.

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,999
I'm one year older.

98
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,754
Yep, that's usually how it works.

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,468
A year older than he ever got to be.

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,395
He joined Starfleet because he...

101
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,193
He believed in it.

102
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
I joined on a dare.

103
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,155
You joined to see
if you could live up to him.

104
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,554
Uh, you spent all this time
trying to be George Kirk

105
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,913
and now you're wondering
just what it means to be Jim.

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,072
Why you're out here.

107
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,515
To perfect eyesight
and a full head of hair.

108
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Kirk here.

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,231
Captain,
approaching Yorktown base.

110
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,197
I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

111
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,513
Let's keep this birthday thing
under wraps, huh?

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,239
Yeah, you know me. Mr. Sensitive.

113
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,197
Wow. That is impressive.

114
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,830
Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she?

115
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,918
What a damn monstrosity!

116
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,437
Couldn't we just rent
some space on a planet?

117
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,951
Showing geographical favoritism
among inducted Federation worlds

118
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,560
could cause diplomatic tension.

119
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
Oh, you don't think that looks tense?

120
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,193
Looks like a damn snow globe
in space just waiting to break!

121
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,591
Oh, that's the spirit, Bones.

122
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,039
Spock!

123
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,359
Do you have a moment?

124
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,155
Of course, Nyota.

125
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,634
I think you should have this back.

126
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
After all, it belonged to your mother.

127
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,635
It's not in the Vulcan custom

128
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,757
to receive again
that which was given as a gift.

129
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
You guys break up?

130
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
What'd you do?

131
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,710
A typically reductive inquiry, Doctor.

132
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,075
You know, Spock, if an Earth girl says,
uh, "It's me, not you,"

133
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,992
it's definitely you.

134
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,197
Excuse me. Commander Spock?

135
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,151
May we have a moment of your time?

136
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,592
This is wonderful!
You know I've never been here?

137
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,592
What I hear is that
the bars here are excellent.

138
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,595
I'm so glad you guys could come.

139
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,795
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

140
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,952
Live long and prosper.

141
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,471
Live long and prosper.

142
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,110
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

143
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,750
Unidentified. Non-Federation.

144
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,276
Attention, unidentified vessel.
You are not authorized for approach.

145
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,271
Power down and await instructions.

146
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,430
Unidentified vessel, please comply.

147
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,039
Speak normally.

148
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,456
Language analysis complete.

149
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,959
Is this working?

150
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,951
We were on a science mission
inside the nebula.

151
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,552
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

152
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,470
I took an escape pod

153
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,155
before the ship crash landed
on a nearby planet.

154
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,835
We need a ship
capable of navigating the nebula.

155
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,432
You must have someone

156
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,473
who can help us.

157
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,594
We tracked her stranded ship
to a sector of uncharted nebula,

158
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,672
here at 2-1-0 mark 14.

159
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,594
- Uh, long-range scan?
- No data.

160
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,713
The nebula is too dense.
It's uncharted space.

161
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,515
Well, the Enterprise does have
the best navigational system in the fleet.

162
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
She could handle it.

163
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,114
The only ship here
with more advanced technology

164
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,397
is still under construction.

165
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,515
But it's not just the
ship that I'm sending.

166
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,556
- I'll gather the crew.
- Captain.

167
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,753
Starfleet command
sent me your application

168
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,752
for the Vice Admiral position
here at this installation.

169
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,839
Yes, ma'am. Um...

170
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,713
If I may, I would

171
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,075
recommend Commander Spock
replace me as Captain of the Enterprise.

172
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,713
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer.
He'd make a great captain.

173
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,709
It isn't uncommon, you know,

174
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,673
even for a captain,

175
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,071
to want to leave.

176
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,993
There is no relative direction
in the vastness of space.

177
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,311
There is only yourself,

178
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,473
your ship, your crew.

179
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,074
It's easier than you think, to get lost.

180
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,240
- It's not about...
- I'll bring it up with the General Council.

181
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,753
We'll discuss it when you return.

182
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,395
Ma'am.

183
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,989
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

184
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,680
- I was thinking...
- Perhaps there...

185
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,196
- No, please.
- Captain, after you.

186
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,635
I insist.

187
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,199
After this mission,
we should, uh, sit down.

188
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,176
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

189
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,918
I as well have something to share.

190
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,391
We make a good team. Right?

191
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,754
I believe we do.

192
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I insist.

193
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,556
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a ship-wide channel.

194
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,993
Yes, Captain.

195
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,553
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

196
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,200
Our mission is straightforward.

197
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,753
Rescue a crew stranded on a planet
in uncharted space.

198
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,760
Our trajectory will take us
through an unstable nebula,

199
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,829
one which will disable
all communications with Starfleet.

200
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,589
We're gonna be on our own.

201
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,469
The Enterprise has something
no other ship in the fleet has,

202
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
you.

203
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,359
And as we've come to understand,

204
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,954
there is no such thing as the unknown,

205
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,079
only the temporarily hidden.

206
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Kirk out.

207
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,349
Mmm. Readings indicate
cloud density diminishing, sir.

208
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,194
This is Altamid.
My ship is stranded here.

209
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,309
Approaching Altamid. Class-M planet.

210
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,478
Massive subterranean development.

211
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,516
But limited to no life forms
on the surface.

212
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Proximity alert, sir!

213
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
We have an unknown ship
heading right for us.

214
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
- Lieutenant Uhura, hail them.
- Yes, Captain.

215
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,637
No response.
I am picking up some kind of signal.

216
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,959
They're jamming us.

217
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,112
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

218
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,793
What is this?

219
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,760
Shields up! Red alert!

220
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,479
Fire at will.

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,230
Sir, our phasers
are having minimal effect

222
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,470
and our torpedos
can't track their movements!

223
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,879
Fire everything we've got.

224
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
Captain, we are not equipped
for this manner of engagement.

225
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,416
Shield frequencies have no effect, sir!

226
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,318
They took out the dish!
Shields are inoperable!

227
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,037
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,496
Why the hell aren't we moving?

229
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,431
I can't engage the warp drive, sir!

230
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,595
Scotty, I need warp now!

231
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,556
I cannae, sir! The nacelles, they've...

232
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,109
They've gone!

233
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,152
Security, engage
all emergency procedures.

234
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,276
Active protocol 28 Code One Alpha Zero.

235
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
All personnel to alert stations.

236
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,993
Sir, I have hull breaches
in levels 12 to 15,

237
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,072
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

238
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,656
Captain! There's a chance
I can reroute the energy reserves

239
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,319
from the warp core
to the impulse engines.

240
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
If we can get back into the nebula,
maybe we could lose them.

241
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,398
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

242
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,471
Wee man! Let's go.

243
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,916
Fit the plasma conduits
and stand by to reroute on my mark!

244
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,200
- Captain.
- Go, Spock.

245
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,560
I have identified the individual

246
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,318
who appears to be
leading the attack party.

247
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,416
He infiltrated the archive vault

248
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,670
and removed the artifact
from our mission on Teenax.

249
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,239
Hold your distance until...

250
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Spock!

251
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Spock!

252
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,936
You two, with me.
Sulu, you have the conn.

253
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Yes, sir.

254
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,473
My God.

255
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
What the hell?

256
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Doctor?

257
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,639
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

258
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,678
Captain

259
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,039
Kirk.

260
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,756
Yes! We are at 100% impulse.

261
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,239
Great work, Mr. Scott!

262
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,072
Maximum impulse towards the nebula.

263
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,469
Aye.

264
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,789
Kirk to Bridge.

265
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,074
We are losing
the inertial dampeners!

266
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,160
Systems are failing ship-wide, Captain.

267
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,233
Emergency bulkheads are sealing,

268
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,790
but structural integrity
is at 18% and falling, sir!

269
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,676
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

270
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,398
Sound the alarm.

271
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,950
Abandon ship. All personnel.

272
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,040
We need to give those pods
a chance to escape.

273
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,673
Can you lead those ships away?

274
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
Impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve.

275
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,957
We cannot move
until the saucer is separated.

276
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,349
I'll handle it.

277
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,074
Aye-aye, sir.

278
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,679
Abandon ship.
All personnel evacuate immediately.

279
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,995
You okay? Oh, my God.
Get him up. Help him up.

280
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Got you.

281
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,080
We've got to get you guys
to an escape pod. Go.

282
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,549
Go! Ensign Syl.

283
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,115
I need your help.

284
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,515
Yes, sir.

285
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,193
My God.

286
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,470
Spock, they're taking the crew!

287
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,275
Abandon ship.
All personnel evacuate immediately.

288
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Are you okay?

289
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,616
The saucer should be free by now!

290
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,234
I know, Mr. Sulu.
The Captain should be there!

291
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,552
All personnel evacuate immediately.

292
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,473
Impulse engines drawing power
from auxiliary generators.

293
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,914
Captain!

294
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,190
How many of the crew
are still aboard the saucer?

295
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,469
None.

296
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,876
But if I'm reading this correctly,

297
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,439
the intruders are taking them.

298
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,150
Captain,
we are caught in the planet's gravity.

299
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,591
We cannot pull away.

300
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,079
Get to your Kelvin Pods.

301
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,352
- Yes, sir.
- Aye, Captain.

302
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,998
Come on, let's go!

303
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Let's go.

304
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Come on.

305
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Chekov!

306
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,152
You knew. You knew we'd be attacked.

307
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,680
You don't understand.

308
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,234
Captain! Captain Kirk!

309
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,515
Yes. I lied.

310
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,280
Our ship was attacked.

311
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,275
Chekov, check the comms for survivors.

312
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,759
- Aye, Captain.
- Who is he?

313
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,398
His name is Krall.

314
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,353
He took my crew. Like he took yours.

315
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,037
How did he know so much
about the Enterprise?

316
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,792
All I know is that if I did this,

317
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,553
he would set them free.

318
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,518
Chekov, are you picking
anything up on those scanners?

319
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,039
Nothing, sir.

320
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,950
- What if they...
- No, no.

321
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,789
He was taking them.

322
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,679
We have to find that saucer.

323
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,070
Even minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder.

324
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,559
Aye, Captain, it's possible.

325
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,199
Captain.

326
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,995
I was protecting my crew.

327
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,269
What is your name?

328
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,357
How do you know our language?

329
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,875
I know your kind.

330
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,598
I am Lieutenant Nyota Uhura
of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

331
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,910
And you have committed
an act of war against the...

332
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,475
Federation!

333
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,957
Federation is an act of war.

334
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,913
You attacked us.

335
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880
Your captain...

336
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,396
Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?

337
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,712
He would have done the same.

338
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,557
And if he made it off of that ship,
he will come for us.

339
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,636
I am counting on it, Lieutenant Uhura.

340
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,432
I can't believe it.

341
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
My God, Spock.

342
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
God...

343
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,872
Sit down over here.

344
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,318
Okay. Okay, sit. Easy.

345
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,155
Okay.

346
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,708
Now, just try and relax.
You're gonna be okay.

347
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,037
The forced optimism
in your voice suggests

348
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,336
that you are trying
to elicit a sense of calm in order to...

349
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
I'll cut the horseshit.

350
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,830
Doctor, I fail to see
how excrement of any kind

351
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,515
bears relevance on our current situation.

352
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,776
Whoa, whoa,
what the hell are you doing?

353
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
We must keep moving, Doctor.

354
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,880
Spock, this thing's punctured
your iliac region!

355
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
Time is a critical factor.

356
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,720
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.

357
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,756
Look, if I can't take this out,
you're gonna die.

358
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,560
Okay? If I take it out and can't stop
the bleeding, you're gonna die.

359
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,838
I can see no appeal in either option.

360
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,753
Believe it or not, neither can I.

361
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,757
So, if I remember correctly,

362
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,230
the Vulcans have their hearts
where humans have their livers.

363
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,992
That is correct, Doctor.

364
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,397
That explains a thing or two.

365
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,599
You know, you're lucky.
An inch to the left...

366
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,351
And you'd be dead already.

367
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,318
I just don't get it, Spock.

368
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,915
I mean, what did they attack us for?

369
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,312
I mean, they do all this for some

370
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,556
doodad that the tiny critters didn't want?

371
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,039
It is unwise to trivialize

372
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,868
that which one
simply does not understand, Doctor.

373
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,554
We can safely assume
it is more important than a doodad.

374
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,713
I think you just managed
to insult me twice, Spock.

375
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Okay.

376
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,435
All right, Spock, I just got one question.

377
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,840
- What's your favorite color?
- I fail to see the relevance.

378
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,273
Ow!

379
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,079
Yeah. They say it hurts less
if it's a surprise.

380
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,515
If I may adopt a parlance
with which you are familiar,

381
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,910
I can confirm your theory
to be horseshit.

382
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,272
We got to get out of here.

383
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Come on.

384
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,120
You're kidding me, aren't you?

385
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,468
Hello there.

386
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,037
My name is Montgomery Scott.
And, uh, who might you be?

387
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,909
Watch it, sonny.

388
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,877
I'm pretty handy
when I want to be, all right?

389
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,191
Don't come back!

390
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,751
We certainly showed them, eh, lassie?

391
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,155
That's Starfleet property, okay.
You cannae just take it.

392
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,835
Uh, but I'm feeling generous today,
so have at it.

393
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,032
Where you get that?

394
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,920
- Is that English?
- I learn it from my house.

395
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
- Where you get that?
- It's my Starfleet insignia.

396
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,280
What does it mean?

397
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,272
Means that I'm an officer of Starfleet.
Uh, engineering division.

398
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,196
- Engineering?
- That's right. I fix things.

399
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
I know what is engineering.

400
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,560
You're not with those bastards
that killed my ship, are you?

401
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,918
I'll take that as a no.

402
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,513
He is Krall. Him and his

403
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,349
bees.

404
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,076
They search the stars
for a death machine.

405
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,470
They're the reason why you here.
Why we are all here.

406
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,239
Even those three scunners?

407
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,672
They have fallen from the sky,
like me and you.

408
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,916
Come with me. Now!

409
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,241
Wait, no... Hang on a minute, lassie.
I'm having a difficult day here.

410
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,273
I've got to find my crewmates.

411
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,950
I will help you find your mates.

412
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,758
And then you will help me.

413
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
With what?

414
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,588
You want me to fix something?

415
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,274
Yes. You help me, and I help you.

416
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,176
All right, well, things being as they are,

417
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,668
I doubt I'll get a better offer today,
so, lead the way.

418
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,069
Good.

419
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,752
I am Jaylah.

420
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,274
- And you are Montgomery Scott.
- Aye, Scotty.

421
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,432
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

422
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,109
All right, hold up.

423
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,718
The Enterprise.

424
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,713
She may not even have power
to the Bridge, Captain.

425
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,354
She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.

426
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,839
I'd bet on it.

427
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,358
McCoy to Enterprise. Come in.

428
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,871
McCoy to Enterprise.

429
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,874
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.

430
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,837
That was just
a temporary fix back there.

431
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,115
I understand, Doctor.

432
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,194
Fascinating.

433
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,589
Ominous. Dark. Dangerous.

434
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,114
We're going in.

435
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,999
Intriguing.
These symbols are the same as those

436
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,316
depicted on the artifact
taken in the attack.

437
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,311
You think it came from here?

438
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,872
It would seem so.

439
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,349
Damn it, Spock.

440
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,633
Easy. Easy.

441
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,193
Hurry.

442
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,800
- Are we there yet?
- Stop asking that.

443
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,549
- Sorry.
- This is the way. Come.

444
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,717
And watch your steps.
You do not want to set off my traps.

445
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,589
Oh.

446
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,113
That's clever.

447
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,438
What is this place?

448
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,952
- This is my house.
- Your house?

449
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,634
Hold on a minute. Is this a ship?

450
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,430
I help you find your friends
and you help me fix it.

451
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,710
So I can leave this planet forever.

452
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,956
Wait a minute. Is this your ship?

453
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,992
No, Montgomery Scotty.

454
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,959
It's yours.

455
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,719
Oh, my good Lord.

456
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,308
Captain,
it looks like there is power.

457
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,354
All right,
let's get to the Bridge and find the crew.

458
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,478
The console is intact, Captain.

459
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,358
I will try to reroute power to it.

460
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
Work fast.

461
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,040
Once we get this place lit up,
we're gonna draw a lot of attention.

462
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,296
What do you think,
can you find them?

463
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,469
Aye, Captain.

464
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,109
I am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crew's signals.

465
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,078
You're with me.
I left something behind.

466
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,120
That is one heck of a cold.

467
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,758
Nice job, Keenser.

468
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,160
All right, we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation. Come on.

469
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,359
Let's go. Come on.

470
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,948
Come on.

471
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,391
This is the Magellan Probe.

472
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,997
The Federation was using these
to find a way through the nebula.

473
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,316
What's he using it for?

474
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
What do you see?

475
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,149
He's been piggybacking
the subspace links between the probes.

476
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,674
Can we use it to send a distress signal?

477
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,475
I can try.

478
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,995
It's sent.

479
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,230
He's accessed the Yorktown database.

480
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
What?

481
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,190
He's got Starfleet data files, ship logs,

482
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,318
including the Enterprise.

483
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,995
He's been watching us this whole time.

484
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,714
Captain,

485
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,039
the artifact was on the ship
the whole time?

486
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,916
I couldn't afford to get caught with it,
so I hid it in here.

487
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,311
Tell Krall I have the Abronath.

488
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,509
Do you believe
every sad story you hear?

489
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,431
Not every.

490
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,718
Put the phaser down.

491
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Please.

492
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,313
You get it, Chekov?

493
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,352
Aye, Captain, I have traced
the location of her call.

494
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,120
What does Krall want with this thing?

495
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,520
To save you

496
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,194
from yourselves.

497
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,629
Captain!

498
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,679
- You all right?
- Aye, Captain,

499
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,552
but we are trapped!

500
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,680
Can you get this thing started?

501
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,075
Are you intimating
that we should engage the thrusters?

502
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,839
I am open to other suggestions.

503
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,878
Okay.

504
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,277
- There is a problem.
- What?

505
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,828
The fuel is primed,
but I cannot get it to combust.

506
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,155
Oy, Captain, we are basically
standing on a very large bomb.

507
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,616
If you miss
the combustion compressor...

508
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,696
I'm not gonna miss, come on.

509
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,896
Do you even know what
the combustion compressor looks like?

510
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,273
It's square, right?

511
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,068
No, sir, it's round.

512
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,919
That's what I said.

513
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,835
Run!

514
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,234
Go!

515
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,833
Chekov!

516
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,519
Chekov! Move!

517
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,356
You think you know

518
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,911
what sacrifice really means?

519
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,278
Federation has taught you
that conflict should not exist.

520
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,474
Ha!

521
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,433
But without struggle,

522
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,435
you would never know who you truly are.

523
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,594
You have no idea who we are.

524
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,634
But you'll soon find out.

525
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,112
You mean the distress signal
you thought you sent?

526
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,072
The coordinates were altered.

527
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,517
Your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula

528
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,114
and your base left vulnerable.

529
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,791
You're going to attack Yorktown.

530
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,315
Millions of souls from every
Federation world holding hands.

531
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,632
It's a perfect target.

532
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,312
You're wrong. There is strength in unity.

533
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,835
The strength of others, Lieutenant,

534
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,548
is what has kept me alive.

535
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,069
No!

536
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,429
Spock.

537
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,351
Spock, wake up, damn it!

538
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,556
I am entirely conscious, Doctor.

539
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,352
I'm simply contemplating
the nature of mortality.

540
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,679
Feeling philosophical, huh?

541
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,191
Massive blood loss will do that to you.

542
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,315
You asked me why
Lieutenant Uhura and I parted ways.

543
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,679
I became concerned,
in the light of Vulcan's demise,

544
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,876
that I owed a debt of duty to my species.

545
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,071
You thought you should be off
making little Vulcans, huh?

546
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,915
Yeah, I can see
how that would upset her.

547
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,071
I intended to discuss it with her further,

548
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,277
but I received some news
which affected me unexpectedly.

549
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,239
What news?

550
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,434
Ambassador Spock has died.

551
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,755
Oh.

552
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,671
Spock, I'm so sorry.

553
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,752
I can't imagine what that must feel like.

554
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,273
When you've lived as many lives as he,

555
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,035
fear of death is illogical.

556
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,112
Fear of death

557
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,790
is what keeps us alive.

558
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,951
I want to live as he did.

559
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,311
That is why I decided

560
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,237
to redirect my efforts
and continue his work

561
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,280
on New Vulcan.

562
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,071
You're leaving Starfleet?

563
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,396
What did Jim have to say about that?

564
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,635
I could not find the time to tell him.

565
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,310
Well, I can tell you
he's not gonna like that.

566
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,594
Hell, I don't know
what he'd do without you.

567
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,234
I mean, me on the other hand,
I'd throw a party, but...

568
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,836
My God, you're getting delirious.

569
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,270
How far are we
from the coordinates of that call?

570
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,274
Still a ways, sir.

571
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,960
- Captain?
- Yeah.

572
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,195
When did you begin to suspect her?

573
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,678
Not soon enough.

574
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,795
How did you know?

575
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,240
Well...

576
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,919
I guess you could say
I've got a good nose for danger.

577
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,989
Run!

578
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,433
Is that music?

579
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,272
Where on earth is that coming from?

580
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
There.

581
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,991
I plugged the little box in the power cell

582
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,116
and the little mouths make it sing.

583
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,792
That's very clever.

584
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,998
Music's a bit old-fashioned for my taste,

585
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,720
not to mention very loud and distracting,

586
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,398
but, aye, well played.

587
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,793
I like the beats and shouting.

588
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,509
Oh, you do?

589
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,439
- Switch it off.
- Ach, you're okay.

590
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,238
Switch it off!

591
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,230
Someone set off one of my traps.

592
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,031
Shh.

593
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,989
Captain?

594
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,637
- You know these men?
- Aye, lassie.

595
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,035
- That wee man there is Pavel Chekov.
- Hello.

596
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,475
And that handsome bastard
is James T. Kirk.

597
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,828
They're my mates.

598
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,035
It's good to see you, sir.

599
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,479
What is she doing, Scotty?

600
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,148
Don't hurt them. No, don't!

601
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,755
Hit her!

602
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,953
- You're free, James T.
- There we go.

603
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
Mr. Scott.

604
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,352
Who's your new friend here?

605
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,776
She sure knows
how to throw out a welcome mat.

606
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,320
- This is Jaylah.
- I do not know what is a welcome mat.

607
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,640
- You find anybody else?
- No, sir.

608
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,959
I'm sorry, you're the only ones.

609
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,336
What the hell happened up there, Jim?
Why were we attacked?

610
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,641
They were after the artifact
we brought back from T eenax.

611
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
- Did they get it?
- No.

612
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,080
- Have you got it?
- No.

613
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,360
I had to get it off the Enterprise,
put it on a shuttle.

614
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,391
- You hid it in a shuttle.
- Yes.

615
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,109
And no.

616
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,430
This is the U. S. S. Franklin, sir.
Can you believe it?

617
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,750
First Earth ship capable of warp 4.

618
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,877
Went missing in the Gagarin
Radiation Belt in the early 2160s.

619
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,456
I remember that
from the Academy.

620
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,038
Captain Balthazar Edison.

621
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,038
One of the first heroes of Starfleet.

622
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,917
How the hell did his ship end up here?

623
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,319
There's a lot of theories, sir.

624
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,676
Surrendered to the Romulans.
Captured by a giant green space hand.

625
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,990
This far out,
it's got to be a wormhole displacement.

626
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,229
Can she fly?

627
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,799
She's missing a few driver coils

628
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,279
and the EPS conduits are fried,

629
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,351
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job

630
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,391
of getting the ship's systems
back online.

631
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,835
- Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.
- Pardon me.

632
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,150
Mr. Chekov,
can you plug in the coordinates.

633
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,840
See if you can track the crew's location
from the ship's sensors.

634
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,074
Aye, Captain.

635
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,096
- He likes that seat.
- Mr. Scott.

636
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,758
- Tour.
- Yes, the mess hall.

637
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,876
- Jaylah, if you will.
- Yes.

638
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,316
No clue
what happened to the crew, huh?

639
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,149
No, sir. They'd be dead
a hundred years by now.

640
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,549
Is that a...

641
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,037
That's a PX70!

642
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,908
Wow.

643
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,074
My dad used to have one
when he was a kid.

644
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,429
My mom said he'd put her
on the back of it, drive her nuts.

645
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Sir.

646
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Um...

647
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,394
So you're telling me
this thing's been here this whole time

648
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,640
and no one's ever noticed it?

649
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,594
She's rigged up
image refractors.

650
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
Here.

651
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,358
So, like some sort of
holographic camouflage.

652
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,868
Aye, sir.

653
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,029
Captain!

654
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,317
I have intercepted a weak
communications transmission, sir.

655
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,753
It's a Starfleet frequency.

656
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,791
Can you lock on to the signal?

657
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,996
Yes, but how do we get to them?

658
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,069
I have an idea, sir.

659
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
But I'm gonna need your permission.

660
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,016
Why would you need my permission?

661
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,713
Because if I mess it up,
I don't want it to be just my fault.

662
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,272
McCoy and Spock to Enterprise crew.
Come in, Enterprise crew.

663
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,195
Anyone.

664
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,359
Come on, Spock.

665
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,996
Come on, you can make it.

666
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,109
Leaving me behind
will significantly increase

667
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,872
your chances of survival, Doctor.

668
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,336
Well, that's damn chivalrous of you,

669
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,576
but completely out of the question.

670
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,751
It is imperative that
you locate any surviving crew.

671
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,518
And here I was thinking you cared.

672
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,153
Of course I care, Leonard.

673
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,592
I always assumed
my respect for you was clear.

674
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,554
The dialogue we have had
across the years has always...

675
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,868
It's okay, Spock.

676
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,392
You don't have to say it.

677
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,799
Well, at least I won't die alone.

678
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,558
Well, that's just typical.

679
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,596
Come on, you bastards!

680
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,189
Oh.

681
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,016
Good to see you in one piece, Doctor.

682
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,189
Oh, am I?

683
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,680
I feel like my innards
have been to a barn dance!

684
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,336
Aye, well, these old transporters
were only ever used for cargo,

685
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,120
but a few modifications
seem to do the trick.

686
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,200
I thought it best
to beam you one at a time, though.

687
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,555
- You know, in case you got spliced.
- Oh.

688
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,200
I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

689
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,376
Good to have you back. You all right?

690
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,674
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

691
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,637
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

692
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,835
In a pig's eye, you are!

693
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,956
Captain, we discovered
that the stolen artifact

694
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,240
appears to have
come from this planet.

695
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Damn it, Spock.

696
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,216
Are there any medical supplies
on this thing?

697
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
This way.

698
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,355
All right. Lie down. Come on.

699
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,396
There you go.

700
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,336
How are we gonna get out
of this one, Spock?

701
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,670
We've got no ship, no crew.
Not the best odds.

702
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,360
We will do
what we have always done, Jim.

703
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,755
We will find hope in the impossible.

704
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,296
Let's get you patched up first, okay?

705
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
No, Captain.

706
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,600
You must focus your efforts
on helping the crew.

707
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,756
Well, that's why
I need you around, Spock.

708
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,680
These things are from the dark ages.

709
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,474
Bones.

710
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,473
I'm pretty sure this is a protoplaser.

711
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,552
Should stop the internal hemorrhaging.

712
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,995
At least that's my hope.

713
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,835
"The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope."

714
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,633
Death's door
and he's quoting Shakespeare.

715
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,510
Captain's Log, Stardate 2262.18.

716
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,357
The mission, routine investigation...

717
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,656
If the universe is truly endless...

718
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,558
What seemed so clear to me
two years ago now seems,

719
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,471
well, far away.

720
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,833
You will tell me where it is!

721
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,160
Now!

722
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,520
Stop! Stop!

723
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,360
Let him go
and I will give you what you want!

724
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,839
No! Syl, don't!

725
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:33,110
Lieutenant, unity is not your strength.

726
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,433
It is your weakness.

727
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,913
We should wait
until we're absolutely sure.

728
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,434
No, we have to get the crew back now.

729
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,881
Chekov has the coordinates that can
lead us to Krall's base, so we go!

730
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,416
With respect, sir, how do we know
that Krall was at the base

731
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,509
when she called him?

732
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,576
Even if he was, we don't know
that the crew is even with him.

733
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,616
Or if they're even still alive.

734
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,756
Mr. Chekov, can you reconfigure
the search parameters

735
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,149
in order to compensate for this formula?

736
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,915
Aye, Commander,
but what is this formula?

737
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,435
It is Vokaya, Mr. Chekov.

738
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,480
A mineral unique to Vulcan
which emits low-level radiation.

739
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,434
I will have to filter out
all other energy emissions.

740
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,456
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan
mineral be doing way out here?

741
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,799
Where are you going with this?

742
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,677
Lieutenant Uhura
wears a Vokaya amulet

743
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,354
which I presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect.

744
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,316
You gave your girlfriend
radioactive jewelry?

745
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,776
The emission
is harmless, Doctor.

746
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,109
But its unique signature
makes it very easy to identify.

747
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,359
You gave your girlfriend
a tracking device.

748
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,709
That was not my intention.

749
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,510
I'm glad he doesn't respect me.

750
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,239
Huh.

751
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,710
I am detecting
a very trace amount of Vokaya.

752
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,696
Does the location match the coordinates

753
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,200
you acquired from Kalara, Mr. Chekov?

754
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,233
It is a match, sir.

755
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,096
Its presence suggests that Lieutenant
Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew

756
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,076
are being held
at Krall's base of operation.

757
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,635
Can you beam them out?

758
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,874
No, sir. There is some
geological interference

759
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,269
that is blocking the transporter signal.

760
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,776
Well, I guess we're gonna have to go in

761
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,376
and break them out
the old-fashioned way.

762
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,914
You cannot go to this place.

763
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,876
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

764
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,796
You've...
You've been there? You've seen it?

765
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,976
Well, why didn't you
say something, lassie?

766
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,560
Because I know you will
ask me to take you there.

767
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,397
If your friends are there,
then they will die, just like my family.

768
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,315
And I will not go back
to that death place!

769
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,720
Aye, but if you've escaped,

770
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,576
then you can show us
the way in and the way out.

771
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,478
No! This is not the deal we made,
Montgomery Scotty.

772
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,035
If you choose to do this,
you are on your own.

773
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,040
Wait.

774
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,189
Let her go.

775
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,430
She's lost people, too, Captain.

776
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,590
Look, that's our friends out there,
lassie. Right?

777
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,432
We cannae just leave them behind.

778
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,873
Now, we could really use your help.

779
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,958
We just need you to be brave, is all.

780
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,629
When we were in that place,

781
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,950
Krall would come and take someone.

782
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,278
There were screams.

783
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,438
I can still hear them.

784
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,677
And we would not see
that person again.

785
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,069
We did not know who would be next.

786
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,796
My father planned an escape.

787
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,996
But we were seen
by the one they call Manas.

788
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,150
My father fought him so I could get out.

789
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,278
He was brave and Manas killed him.

790
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,796
What you want is impossible.

791
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,512
Look, maybe it's not.

792
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,989
Right. My wee granny used to say,
"Ya cannae break a stick in a bundle."

793
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,835
You're part of
something bigger now, lassie.

794
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,878
Right? Dinnae give up on that.

795
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,916
'Cause we'll sure as hell
never give up on you.

796
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,956
That is what being part of a crew
is all about.

797
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,156
Is that what you believe in, James T.?

798
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,991
All I know is we stand
a better chance with you.

799
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,833
The digging machines uncovered
a tunnel that goes into the crater.

800
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,069
That's how I got out.

801
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,832
So that'll be our way in.

802
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,016
An away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel,

803
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,189
follow it to Krall's base,

804
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,191
get inside the building
and break out the crew.

805
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,593
Uh, Captain, we cannot lock
onto anyone inside the crater

806
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,829
in order to beam them out.

807
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,070
Oh, I could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers.

808
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,336
That'd get the signal out of the crater.

809
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,416
- All right.
- How many people can

810
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,760
the Franklin transport at a time?

811
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,030
Uh, with a wee bit
of modification, 20 max,

812
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,951
but I'm not sure
how long it would hold out.

813
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,268
Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah,

814
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,496
you're with me on the away team.

815
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,351
Mr. Scott, modify that transporter

816
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,616
and then do everything you can
to get this ship operational.

817
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,358
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

818
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,193
makes him more valuable
aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

819
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,120
It is thereby logical
that I would replace him.

820
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,868
Why is that logical, Spock?

821
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,200
You just got back on your feet.

822
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,910
Lieutenant Uhura is in that facility, Jim.

823
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,753
I'll keep an eye on him.

824
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,755
Understood.

825
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,833
But his soldiers are everywhere.

826
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,353
We won't pass unseen.

827
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,039
What we require is a diversion.

828
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,715
I think I have an idea.

829
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,233
This is Abronath.

830
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,914
It was used by the Ancient Ones
as a weapon.

831
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,477
But when they could not
control its deadly power,

832
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,790
they split it into two

833
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,275
and ejected the halves into space,

834
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,990
hoping it would be lost forever.

835
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,395
But I am grateful.

836
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,158
I have spent lifetimes searching for it,

837
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,151
only to have you

838
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,631
find it for me.

839
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,076
The poetry of fate.

840
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,478
The world that I was born into

841
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,076
is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

842
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,833
We knew pain. We knew terror.

843
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,037
Struggle made us strong.

844
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,078
Not peace. Not unity.

845
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,073
These are myths
the Federation would have you believe.

846
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,829
Those are strong words.

847
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,029
You might even believe them,

848
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,350
but there's something else
going on with you.

849
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,953
Something underneath.

850
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,200
Uhura!

851
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,995
Wait.

852
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,028
What are you doing with her?

853
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,520
You already got what you wanted!
Let her go!

854
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,554
Syl!

855
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,114
No, please!

856
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,479
Let her go!

857
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,715
Manas, it's time.

858
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,277
The Federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries.

859
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,432
But no longer.

860
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,149
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

861
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,831
This is where the frontier pushes back.

862
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,875
This way.

863
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,394
Where is she?

864
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,196
I've got to admit,
that's a hell of a distraction.

865
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,520
Your friends are over there.

866
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,234
Come on.

867
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,275
Go!

868
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,789
Commander. Uhura, they took her.

869
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,320
Get the remainder of the crew to safety.

870
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,839
Come on, let's go! Move!

871
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,272
- Stay in the circle.
- Come on! Hurry!

872
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,696
I've got them, Mr. Scott!

873
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,312
Okay, Mr. Chekov, increase the signal.

874
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,913
We're gonna grab them 20 at a time.

875
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,797
- Aye.
- Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

876
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,393
Energize!

877
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,995
Spock.

878
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,951
What are you doing here?

879
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,397
Clearly, I am here to rescue you.

880
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,869
Let's go.

881
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,795
Good to see you, wee man.

882
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,016
Ten seconds until
the transporter's recharged, Doctor.

883
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,996
- Wait for my signal.
- Doctor!

884
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,071
Damn it, man,
we're not leaving without them!

885
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,353
Come on. Let's go. Move!

886
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,955
Let's go! Come on!

887
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,496
We're ready for you next,
Captain. Just turn on your beacon.

888
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,919
Scotty, do you have everybody?

889
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,616
Aye, sir. Everyone
except you and Jaylah.

890
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,000
Hit the beacon and we'll grab you.

891
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,120
Captain, your beacon!

892
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,188
- There it is!
- Energize.

893
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,519
Jaylah, now!

894
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,160
Okay...

895
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,391
Let's never do that again.

896
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,239
I agree, James T.

897
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,440
You all right?

898
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,950
Captain! This thing he has...

899
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,635
Yorktown. He's gonna destroy Yorktown.

900
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,998
You take my house

901
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,952
and you make it fly.

902
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,716
Scotty, can you get this thing started?

903
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,896
Started, yes.
Flying, sir, that's a different thing.

904
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,536
These old vessels,
they were built in space.

905
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,949
They were never supposed
to take off from atmosphere.

906
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,155
Make it happen.

907
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,136
They're called starships
for a reason, Captain.

908
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,718
You're telling me this now?

909
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,176
Because I didn't want
to disappoint you, you know,

910
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,156
in case you didn't make it back.

911
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,470
- How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.
- Captain.

912
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,628
He's launching.

913
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,433
The attack on Yorktown
may be just the beginning.

914
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,432
Armed with this bio-weapon,
he could rid it of all life

915
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,296
and use the base's advanced technology

916
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,240
to attack an untold number
of Federation planets.

917
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,416
Then we're just gonna have to
get this thing flying.

918
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,158
We cannae just jumpstart it, sir!

919
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,870
Okay! All systems online.

920
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,550
Dilithium chambers
at 70% and climbing.

921
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,399
Primary support engines standing by.

922
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,033
Mr. Sulu.

923
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,795
You can, you know, fly this thing, right?

924
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,429
You kidding me, sir?

925
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,268
Fantastic.

926
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,712
Scotty, how we looking?

927
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,354
Ready as she'll ever be, sir.

928
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,960
That's what I like to hear. All right.

929
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,799
Bones, where are we with the crew?

930
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,536
I could use a functioning med-bay,

931
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,073
but otherwise we're secure down here.

932
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:10,996
Mr. Sulu, we have to achieve
terminal velocity

933
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,514
in order for the stabilizers
to provide lift.

934
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,478
Are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that?

935
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,239
We'll find out.

936
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,757
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

937
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,468
Aye-aye, Captain.

938
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,797
Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit
the forward stabilizers full on my mark.

939
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,108
- One quarter impulse.
- Aye.

940
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,271
One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.

941
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,635
Aye.

942
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,752
We should belt up. Go on. Go!

943
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,669
Easy, Mr. Sulu.
Let's not break her in half.

944
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,678
Any time, Mr. Sulu.

945
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,599
Now, Mr. Chekov!

946
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,919
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

947
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,039
No reply to all-frequency I.D. request.

948
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,155
Visual.

949
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,074
Red alert! Red alert!

950
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,872
Look how far they've come.

951
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,160
Please proceed

952
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,031
to designated safety zones immediately.

953
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,560
Please proceed to designated
safety zones immediately.

954
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,656
I'm picking up distress signals

955
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,114
from every frequency
coming from Yorktown.

956
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,391
Krall's already started his attack.

957
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,391
Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons
do we have?

958
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,474
Uh, we have pulsed phase cannons
and spatial torpedoes.

959
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,560
Great. Lock and load.

960
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,234
It does not matter.
You cannot defeat the bees.

961
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,550
Maybe, uh, maybe we lure them away.

962
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,995
How do we get Yorktown time
to get people to safety?

963
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,176
No, we are a horse and buggy
compared to those things.

964
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,080
We're barely holding together
as it is, Captain.

965
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:32,074
Captain, the flight patterns of bees
are determined by individual decisions.

966
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,549
Krall's swarm formations
are too complex not to rely

967
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,229
on some form of unified
cyberpathic coordination.

968
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,595
- I surmise that if we...
- Spock! Skip to the end.

969
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,976
What he's saying is that
if we disorient the swarm

970
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,672
we can kick its ass!

971
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,513
Precisely.

972
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,656
Scotty, can you beam me
onto one of those swarm ships?

973
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,840
Have you gone completely mad?

974
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
- Yes or no?
- No!

975
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,395
Yes!

976
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,680
Maybe.

977
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,550
Captain, my familiarity
of the interior of those ships,

978
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,040
however brief, makes me more qualified
for this away mission.

979
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,038
Spock, you're still hurt.

980
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,033
She's right, Spock.

981
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,072
I acknowledge
and respect your concerns.

982
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,201
Perhaps you would feel more confident
if I were accompanied by someone

983
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,435
with familiarity of both
the ship and my injury.

984
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,112
He's gonna love this.

985
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,914
You want me to do what?

986
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,835
- Come along, Doctor.
- Whoa! Wait a minute.

987
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,592
Why, you green-blooded ingrate.

988
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,874
This was your idea!

989
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,480
It's a good idea, Bones.

990
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,520
You know, next time
you have a piece of pipe

991
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,869
stuck in your transverse, call a plumber.

992
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,856
Just make sure you find a way
to break those things.

993
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,680
If it gets hairy,
I'll beam you straight back.

994
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,920
Energize.

995
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,360
You're gonna do great!

996
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,832
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a...

997
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,719
You do realize the last time
I flew one of these things we crashed.

998
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,076
So don't blame me if we...

999
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,800
Hit something.

1000
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,480
Spock to Franklin.

1001
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:03,989
Spock, we read you.

1002
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,416
Captain, from what I can ascertain,

1003
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,192
the ships do indeed share
a cyberpathic link

1004
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,600
which coordinates their actions.

1005
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,868
Patching it through now.

1006
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,751
That's what that signal was.

1007
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,229
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.

1008
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,515
Well, how do we get them
to stop talking?

1009
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,352
What about electromagnetic focusing?

1010
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,136
We could use the transporters,
disrupt their network.

1011
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,832
The focus might be too specific.

1012
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,096
If we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm,

1013
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,256
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate.

1014
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,840
It would have to be
at a frequency they will not anticipate.

1015
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,096
We could cause a chain reaction

1016
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,560
that would wipe out the whole swarm.

1017
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,919
Sir, a closed network like that

1018
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,594
might be susceptible
to very high frequency.

1019
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,279
VHF.

1020
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,076
Radio. We can broadcast something
from the ship to drown out their link.

1021
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,752
Something loud and distracting.

1022
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,432
Loud and distracting?

1023
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,914
I've got just the thing!

1024
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,959
Do not break my music.

1025
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,800
Break it? You're getting an upgrade.

1026
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,596
Swarm ships are 60 seconds
from breaking through!

1027
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,398
I've just got to reconfigure
the VHF output

1028
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,038
into a multiphasic sweep.

1029
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,269
Let me do it.

1030
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,760
Let her do it.

1031
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,434
You do it.

1032
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,391
There, see? Simple.

1033
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,670
All right. Captain,
we're ready to broadcast.

1034
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,839
But the signal won't travel far.
We have to get closer.

1035
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,751
- How close?
- Very.

1036
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,151
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

1037
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,696
Put us right in the middle of that thing.

1038
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,869
Yes, sir.

1039
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,037
My old friend.

1040
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,638
The swarm ships are doubling back!

1041
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,438
They are forming an attack wave, sir.

1042
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,959
I think we got their attention.

1043
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,040
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.
Brace yourselves, everybody.

1044
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,872
Spock, stand by
to drop out of formation.

1045
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,110
- Scotty, you all cued up back there?
- Aye, sir!

1046
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,668
Ready to broadcast at 577 megahertz.

1047
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,795
Made your choice, lassie?

1048
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,598
I have the beat and shouting.

1049
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,353
Let's make some noise.

1050
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,155
That's a good choice.

1051
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,833
Faster, Doctor. We risk being
consumed by their trajectorial decay.

1052
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,280
Damn backseat driver.

1053
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,270
- Evade, Doctor!
- I see it, I see it!

1054
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,797
Is that classical music?

1055
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,797
Yes, Doctor, it would seem to be.

1056
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,598
Lieutenant Uhura, make sure Yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast.

1057
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,910
Sir, we now have
the disruption frequency.

1058
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,155
Broadcast.

1059
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,589
- You two all right, Spock?
- We are fine, Captain,

1060
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,040
but there are still three ships
heading into Yorktown.

1061
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,960
That's got to be Krall.
Keep on him, Spock.

1062
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,157
Do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon.

1063
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,958
My house is breaking!

1064
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,829
We've lost the polarization
of the hull plating!

1065
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:45,070
I can reroute the power
from the dilithium chambers.

1066
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,195
I need you.

1067
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,669
And I need you, Jaylah. Let's go!

1068
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,993
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1069
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,320
You're more than welcome
to switch places with me, Spock.

1070
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,672
Captain, intercepting
all three ships is an impossibility.

1071
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,316
Get me a schematic of Yorktown!

1072
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,350
There! Yorktown headquarters!

1073
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,193
Mr. Chekov, can you do
a bioscan of Central Plaza?

1074
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,315
Aye.

1075
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,038
They are clearing civilians.

1076
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,997
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1077
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,190
You gotta make sure Krall heads for it.

1078
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,315
- Why?
- Just do it!

1079
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,033
Sulu, get us up there.

1080
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,633
Hold onto something!

1081
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,350
- Great work, Bones.
- Thanks, Jim.

1082
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,557
Now I've just got to
figure out how to land.

1083
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,439
Captain, I have three hull breaches
from the impact.

1084
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,034
Deck 3, the cargo bay,
and the engine room.

1085
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,593
All right, Sulu, Chekov,
check the cargo bay and Deck 3.

1086
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,816
We need confirmation
that the weapon has been neutralized

1087
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,909
and Krall is dead!

1088
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:58,800
Captain!

1089
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,760
It's Krall.

1090
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,513
We've seen him do this.

1091
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:12,036
It's some kind of energy transference.
It physically changes him.

1092
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,874
He must still be onboard.
We would have seen him leave.

1093
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,392
Sulu, contact Yorktown security
and lock down the ship.

1094
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,829
Let's go.

1095
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,318
Push the frontier.

1096
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,269
It's about damn time.

1097
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,029
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1098
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,111
All right, baby, let's go.

1099
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,031
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1100
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,794
Captain!

1101
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,680
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1102
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,840
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1103
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,232
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1104
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,957
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1105
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,999
...frontier.

1106
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,993
...frontier.

1107
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,115
It's him.

1108
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,471
Scotty, I need you to link
into the Franklin database.

1109
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,869
Find out what you can
about Balthazar Edison.

1110
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,760
- The captai n of the Franklin?
- Yeah.

1111
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,480
- Sir, he'll be long dead.
- No. He's not.

1112
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,678
I don't know how, but Edison is Krall.

1113
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,880
What'd you find?

1114
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,188
His record goes back

1115
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,880
way before the Federation even existed.

1116
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,496
He was a major in
the United Earth Military Assault

1117
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,670
Command Operation.
A lot of off-world combat.

1118
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,760
He was a soldier.

1119
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,016
Aye, sir.
And a pretty good one.

1120
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,508
His military service came to an end
when MACO was disbanded.

1121
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,296
- Why, what happened?
- The Federation, sir. Starfleet.

1122
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,440
We're not a military agency.

1123
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,456
They made him a captain
and gave him the Franklin.

1124
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,675
- Scotty, bring up his logs.
- Aye, sir.

1125
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,110
- Captain's Log...
- Last entry.

1126
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,194
Captain's Log...
I don't remember the stardate.

1127
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,030
All distress calls unanswered.

1128
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,755
Of the crew,

1129
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,959
only three remain.

1130
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,471
I won't allow it!

1131
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,030
The indigenous race
abandoned this planet long ago.

1132
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,552
They left behind sophisticated
mining equipment

1133
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,553
and a drone workforce.

1134
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,233
They have some sort of technology

1135
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,312
that prolongs life.

1136
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,112
I will do whatever it takes
for me and my crew.

1137
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,751
The Federation do not care about us.

1138
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:01,439
You'll probably never see me again.

1139
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,913
But if you do,

1140
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,919
be ready.

1141
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,198
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1142
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,040
'Cause he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage.

1143
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:13,759
He needs a distribution system.

1144
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,816
They have to circulate air here, right?

1145
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:19,354
Aye, sir. There's an atmospheric
regulator at the core.

1146
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:21,696
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown.
Make sure they shut it down

1147
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,120
- until we find Krall.
- Yes.

1148
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,600
How would he access the core?

1149
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,837
Uh, well, there's a maintenance tower

1150
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,201
at the station's gravitational nexus.
That's the only way.

1151
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,914
Scotty, you get over there.
Make sure it gets shut down!

1152
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,115
Lassie, you're with me.

1153
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,755
Look, this thing
is impossible to shut down.

1154
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,114
Aye, well,

1155
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,313
we'll see about that.

1156
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,798
Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?

1157
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,160
We're working on it, sir,

1158
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,416
but as you can imagine
there's a lot of safety protocols

1159
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,920
surrounding the thing that, you know,

1160
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,916
- keeps everybody alive.
- Figure something out.

1161
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,120
Be careful, Captain.

1162
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,838
Gravity's gonna get a bit screwy

1163
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,518
the closer you get to the center.

1164
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,496
Maybe we should scan
the operational schematics,

1165
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,296
- see if there's a back door.
- Right.

1166
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,640
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1167
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,149
Stop!

1168
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,951
What happened to you
out there, Edison?

1169
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,228
Edison.

1170
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,869
I have to say, Kirk,

1171
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,839
I've missed being me.

1172
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:58,192
We lost ourselves but gained a purpose!

1173
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,508
A means to bring the galaxy

1174
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,309
back to the struggle
that made humanity strong.

1175
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,713
I think you underestimate humanity.

1176
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,071
I fought for humanity!

1177
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,872
Lost millions to the Xindi
and Romulan Wars.

1178
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,508
And for what?

1179
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,190
For the Federation
to sit me in a captain's chair

1180
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,393
and break bread with the enemy.

1181
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,876
We change. We have to.

1182
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,397
Or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.

1183
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,834
You lost!

1184
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,955
There's no way
you can make it back there.

1185
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,119
Give up.

1186
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,792
What, like you did?

1187
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,110
I read your ship's log,

1188
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,436
Captain James T. Kirk.

1189
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,234
At least I know what I am.

1190
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,479
I am a soldier.

1191
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,830
You won the war, Edison.

1192
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,751
You gave us peace.

1193
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,274
Peace

1194
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,431
is not what I was born into.

1195
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,160
Scotty.

1196
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,456
Captain, he's using
the gravitational slipstream

1197
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,072
to carry him back to the center.

1198
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,600
Nah.

1199
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,719
No! No!

1200
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,776
- What's that?
- The weapon's in the chamber.

1201
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,472
Captain, we have to stop
the processor now

1202
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,279
or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead!

1203
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,668
You can't stop it.

1204
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,713
You will die.

1205
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,876
Better to die saving lives

1206
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,556
than to live with taking them.

1207
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,591
That's what I was born into.

1208
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:12,240
Scotty!

1209
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,016
Captain,
I think we can redirect it.

1210
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,792
There's a sealed construction hatch

1211
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,616
that will let you vent the weapon
into space.

1212
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,056
Now, we can override
the locks from up here,

1213
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,536
but you will have to activate the hatch.

1214
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:21,788
So I just hit a button.

1215
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,395
It's not a button, sir.
It's a silver lever under a white panel.

1216
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,196
- Got it!
- And there's four of them.

1217
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,000
Once you've primed the hatch,

1218
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,800
you'll have to exit
the chamber immediately.

1219
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,800
If the hatch is open
when the processor cycles

1220
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,040
and you're in it,
you're gonna get sucked into space.

1221
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,911
What happens if the hatch isn't open?

1222
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,560
You're gonna get sucked into a big fan.

1223
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,036
With the weapon, and we all die.

1224
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,280
Damn it, Jim, you won't
make it out in time!

1225
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,840
The vent!

1226
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,112
Get out of there, James T.!

1227
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,554
Scotty, the last hatch won't open!

1228
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:10,680
Scotty!

1229
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,876
Work fast, Captain, time's running out!

1230
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,075
He's not gonna make it.

1231
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,800
No! No!

1232
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,070
Manual override engaged.

1233
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:23,360
Whoo-hoo!

1234
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,555
What would I do without you, Spock?

1235
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,076
For decades
the Federation taught that he was a hero.

1236
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,675
I guess time will judge us all.

1237
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,078
He just got lost.

1238
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,118
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1239
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,519
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1240
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,992
It wasn't just me. It never is.

1241
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,393
Needless to say, the position
of Vice Admiral is yours.

1242
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,593
No one deserves it more.

1243
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,431
Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?

1244
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,070
No. They don't.

1245
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,511
Well, no offense, ma'am,

1246
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,433
but where's the fun in that?

1247
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:50,040
You didn't even
try to get our time out here reduced?

1248
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:51,256
Why would I get it reduced?

1249
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,669
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.

1250
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,513
Can you imagine what we'll find!

1251
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,989
Alien despots hell-bent on killing us?

1252
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,196
Deadly space-borne
viruses and bacteria?

1253
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:03,990
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant!

1254
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:05,994
It's gonna be so much fun.

1255
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,240
By the way, where are we going?

1256
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,760
I thought we were gonna get a drink.

1257
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,190
I know you told me to keep it
under wraps, but, uh...

1258
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,039
Happy Birthday!

1259
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,478
Mr. Sensitive?

1260
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,032
- There you go, laddie.
- Thanks, Scotty.

1261
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,796
Everybody, raise a glass
to Captain James T. Kirk.

1262
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,677
- Captain Kirk!
- Thanks, everybody.

1263
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,474
- To the Enterprise.
- To the Enterprise.

1264
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:34,959
And

1265
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:37,278
to absent friends.

1266
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,673
- Here's to that.
- Cheers.

1267
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,475
All right,
let's get this party started.

1268
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,629
Whose round is it?

1269
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:48,395
Can I get three, uh,
Romulan ales for me?

1270
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,554
I thought you had to
finish your mission report.

1271
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:53,468
I do.

1272
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:56,916
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socially.

1273
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,274
You old romantic.

1274
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,679
Do you know that scotch
was actually invented

1275
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,591
by a little old lady in Russia?

1276
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,595
- Huh? Not many people know.
- Excuse me.

1277
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:21,396
Uh, did you drink all those yourself?
I'm impressed.

1278
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,910
Someone said it will take my edge off.

1279
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,192
My edge is still not off.

1280
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,598
All right, well, maybe this will help.

1281
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,751
Captain pulled a few strings.

1282
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,112
That is acceptance
into Starfleet Academy, if you want it.

1283
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,560
They have a lot of rules.
Don't listen to them all.

1284
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:40,951
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1285
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:43,439
Afraid so.

1286
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:46,880
Hey, Keenser.

1287
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,754
Kevin. Still not wearing pants, I see.

1288
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,430
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1289
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:03,237
Is that what you wanted
to mention that time in the turbolift?

1290
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,674
More or less.

1291
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,152
I trust your meeting with
Commodore Paris went well.

1292
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:17,873
More or less.

1293
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,909
You really want
to head back out there, huh?

1294
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,832
Space, the final frontier.

1295
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,190
These are
the voyages of the Starship...

1296
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,431
...Enterprise.
Its continuing mission...

1297
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,875
To explore strange new worlds.

1298
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,678
To seek out new life.

1299
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,711
And new civilizations.

1300
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,509
To boldly go
where no one has gone before.
