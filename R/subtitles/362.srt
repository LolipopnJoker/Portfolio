00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,636
<i>Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed.
I am speed.</i>

3
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:59,643
<i>One winner, 42 losers.
I eat losers for breakfast.</i>

4
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,314
<i>Did I used to say that?</i>

5
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,399
Yes, sir, you did.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,278
- You used to say that all the time.
- Mater, what are you doing in here?

7
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,447
Well, I didn't want you to be lonely.

8
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,952
Thank you. But I'm kind of preparing
for a race. I need a little quiet.

9
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,996
Right. You got it, buddy.

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,458
Hey, everybody, listen up.

11
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:27,087
My best friend, lightning McQueen,
needs quiet. Perfect quiet!

12
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,549
Okay. Where was I?

13
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,054
Racing. Real racing.

14
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:41,226
That ain't racing. That wasn't even
a Sunday drive. That was one lap.

15
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,563
Racing is 500 of those.
Everybody fighting to move up.

16
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,692
Lap after lap. Inside, outside,
inches apart. Never touching.

17
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:54,448
- Now that's racing.
- Well, I can't argue with the doc Hudson.

18
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,950
How true, how true.

19
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,954
Hey, lightning, you ready?

20
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,457
Yeah. Lightning's ready.

21
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,420
This one's for you, doc.

22
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:28,889
Come on, stickers.

23
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:32,309
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Best friend coming through. Go, McQueen!

24
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:36,856
- Pass him now, 24!
- Lightning McQueen!

25
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,444
Go, 95!

26
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,569
Hey, Cal, your blinker's on.

27
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:49,531
What? No, it's not.
Hey! Your blinker's on.

28
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:50,824
Good comeback, Cal.

29
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:54,912
<i>Because I want to run that race</i>

30
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:58,624
<i>I want to run that race</i>

31
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:02,294
<i>I do it at my pace</i>

32
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,343
<i>into the pit goes lightning McQueen,
Bobby swift and Cal weathers.</i>

33
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,637
These three are fun to watch,
aren't they, Darrell?

34
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:14,556
You know, Bob, I can't tell
if they have more fun on or off the track.

35
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,101
<i>Finito! Via, via, via, via.</i>

36
00:03:19,102 --> 00:03:21,063
You getting a car wash too, Cal?

37
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,857
No, you're getting a car wash, McQueen.

38
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,150
Good comeback, Cal.

39
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,278
<i>We gotta run that race</i>

40
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:31,657
<i>we gotta run that race</i>

41
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:35,160
<i>we do it at our pace</i>

42
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:39,581
<i>long as we get to run that race
hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

43
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:43,242
lightning, how do you keep your focus
racing against Bobby and Cal?

44
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,371
I think the key is we respect each other.
These guys are real class acts--

45
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,457
congratulations, cupcake.

46
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,168
They are gonna pay.

47
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,886
Go, dinoco!

48
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,263
Great win today, Cal.

49
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:10,476
Thank you, Shannon. It was
a great boost and I was-- hey! Guido!

50
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:13,855
- Pit stop.
- Ha, ha. Laugh it up. Real funny.

51
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:22,030
<i>Andiamo! Andiamo!</i>

52
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,573
Keep it going, buddy!

53
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,738
We're gonna have to load them
for the next town. Don't you let--

54
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,658
hey! Are my sponsors happy today?

55
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:39,120
Stop winning for crying out loud.
We're running out of bumper cream to sell.

56
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,164
Lightning McQueen!

57
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,791
Hey, big Tex.
How's my favorite competitor?

58
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,084
Just say the word and...

59
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,962
I'll boot Cal off the dinoco team
and replace him with you.

60
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,715
You know I can hear you, right?
I'm right here.

61
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:54,302
Bye, Cal. See you next week. Or not.

62
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:56,804
Come on now. I'm joking.

63
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:01,262
Go, little buddy! And big buddy too!

64
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:09,103
<i>Another great finish in the making.
McQueen and swift nose to nose.</i>

65
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,105
How's the view back there, Bobby?

66
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:13,649
Well, you better not blink.
I'll blow right past you.

67
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:17,445
<i>The flag is out. It's the final stretch.
McQueen in the lead.</i>

68
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,740
Okay, let's see what you got.

69
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,250
<i>Holy cow!</i>

70
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,962
<i>It's Jackson storm for the win.
A huge upset!</i>

71
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,048
<i>Neither lightning nor Bobby
ever saw him coming.</i>

72
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:41,260
<i>It's one thing to start fast, but we
haven't seen anyone cross the line...</i>

73
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:44,388
<i>With that kind of speed and power
since a young...</i>

74
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:46,641
<i>Lightning McQueen first arrived
on the scene.</i>

75
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:51,312
- Hey, Bobby? Who is that?
- That's Jackson storm.

76
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,980
Yeah. He's one of the rookies.

77
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:59,695
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
No, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

78
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:04,659
Hey. Jackson storm, right?
Great race today.

79
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,452
Thank you, Mr. McQueen.

80
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:10,039
You have no idea what a pleasure it is
for me to finally beat you.

81
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:15,002
Thanks. Wait. Hang on.
Did you say "meet" or "beat"?

82
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,798
- I think you heard me.
- What?

83
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,258
Storm, can we get some pictures?

84
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:22,009
Yeah, yeah. Come on. Let's get a picture.
You know what?

85
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:25,763
Get a ton of pictures because champ here
has been a role model of mine...

86
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,102
For years now. And I mean a lot of years.
Right? I love this guy.

87
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:35,439
Storm, give us a quote.
What's your top speed?

88
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,316
I think I touched a nerve.

89
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:49,617
Welcome back to chick's picks
with chick Hicks.

90
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:54,038
I'm your host, former and forever,
piston cup champion, chick Hicks.

91
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:55,998
This just in:

92
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:00,127
Rookie Jackson storm slams
the proverbial door on lightning McQueen.

93
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,632
I couldn't have enjoyed it more
if I'd beaten McQueen myself.

94
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:08,636
Wait, I have. But enough about me.

95
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,305
Here to tell you how it happened
is professional number...

96
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,349
Cruncher miss Natalie certain.

97
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:14,934
It's a pleasure to be here, chick.

98
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,187
And actually,
i prefer the term "statistical analyst".

99
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,483
Right. So, who is this mysterious
newcomer, Jackson storm?

100
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,235
And why is he so darn fast?

101
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,904
It's no mystery
if you study the data, Mr. Hicks.

102
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,033
Jackson storm is part of
the next generation of high-tech racers.

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,077
Unlike the veterans of yesterday--

104
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,120
what? Old-timers like this guy?

105
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,460
Right. Storm achieves his top speeds
by exploiting the numbers.

106
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,712
I refer, of course, to racing data.

107
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,299
Tire pressure, downforce, weight
distribution, aerodynamics, and...

108
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,177
Next-gens like storm
are taking advantage.

109
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:52,552
The racing world is changing.

110
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,055
And for the better if it means my old pal,
lightning, is down for the count.

111
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:57,140
Am I right, certain?

112
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,600
Well, if I'm certain of anything, chick...

113
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:03,229
It's that this season
is about to get even more interesting.

114
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:08,067
<i>I'll tell you what, Darrell, Jackson
storm has certainly made an impact.</i>

115
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:11,529
<i>We've got six more next-generation
rookies in the field.</i>

116
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:13,781
<i>With six veterans fired to clear the way.</i>

117
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:16,409
Morning, champ.
How's our living legend today?

118
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,413
Still very much alive, thank you.
And I would appreciate--

119
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,332
you know, I can't believe I get to race
the lightning McQueen.

120
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,710
- In his farewell season.
- What are you talking about?

121
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:30,214
Green flag. Good luck out there, champ.
You're gonna need it.

122
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,308
<i>One reason storm and the next-gens
are more efficient:</i>

123
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,052
Their ability to hold the optimum
racing line every single lap.

124
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:46,471
<i>Win number three
for the rookie sensation.</i>

125
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:49,682
<i>Storm's in a class of his own.
And a big reason for that:</i>

126
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:53,645
<i>Training on the newest cutting-edge
simulators. These machines create a...</i>

127
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:57,607
<i>Virtual racing experience so real
racers never even have to go outside.</i>

128
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,527
<i>Storm's ability to hold that line
is like nothing we've ever seen.</i>

129
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,901
<i>Four in a row? Are you kidding me?</i>

130
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:06,070
<i>2% lower drag coefficient.</i>

131
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,114
<i>- What a finish!
-5% increase downforce.</i>

132
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,827
<i>- Lucky number seven.
-1.2% higher top speed.</i>

133
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:14,703
<i>Amazing! Nine!</i>

134
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:18,999
<i>Piston cup winner, chick Hicks here
with the racer taking the circuit...</i>

135
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,001
<i>By storm. Jackson storm.</i>

136
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:25,047
<i>Another easy win over old "ka-chow".
Or should I say, "caboose"?</i>

137
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,299
<i>Because he's always in the back.
Am I right?</i>

138
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,344
<i>No, no, no, chick.
McQueen is a crafty veteran champ.</i>

139
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:32,680
<i>He's the elder statesman of the sport.
You know?</i>

140
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,266
<i>Takes everything I got to beat him.</i>

141
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,143
You got to be kidding me.

142
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,439
What changes are you gonna make
to get McQueen back on top?

143
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:45,025
- Will McQueen try new training methods?
-Ls he prepared to retire?

144
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:48,404
Come on, guys. Let's not overreact.
It's just a slump.

145
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:52,116
We'll get 'em next week.
Okay, that's enough. No comment.

146
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,785
- Not even about weathers retiring?
- Wait. What?

147
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,996
Cal weathers.
He's hanging up his lightyears.

148
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:01,542
No. No comment on that either.

149
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,502
Wait a minute. Please, come on.
You got to give us something.

150
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:12,177
Hey, Cal! Hey.
Retirement? What's going on?

151
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:17,766
You know, I asked my uncle once
how I'd know when it was time to stop.

152
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:22,479
You know what he said?
The youngsters will tell you.

153
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,698
We had some good times together.
I'm gonna miss that the most I think.

154
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:35,576
Yeah.

155
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,001
<i>More changes ahead, chick.</i>

156
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:47,212
Every week we've seen
veteran racers either retire...

157
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,175
Like Cal weathers tonight,
or fired to make room for these younger...

158
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:54,511
Faster racers. And, it's not over yet.

159
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:59,308
<i>Hello racing fans.
Welcome to the Los Angeles 500.</i>

160
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:03,938
<i>The final race of the piston cup season.
It's been a year of surprises--</i>

161
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,857
they can't do this.
I've raced for you guys almost 10 years.

162
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:11,153
Sorry, brick. My mind's made up.
I'm giving your number to someone new.

163
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,863
Hey, I had two wins last year!

164
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,449
The whole sport's changing.
I'm just doing what I got to do.

165
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:22,373
Do you know what's happening with brick--
wait, you're not Bobby.

166
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,209
The name's Danny, bro.

167
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,974
Hey, champ, where'd all your friends go?

168
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,854
<i>A final check of his tires
as storm settles into the pole position.</i>

169
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,817
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity.
Let's end this season with a great race.</i>

170
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,875
That's it, buddy!

171
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,054
<i>Forty laps to go
and race leader, Jackson storm...</i>

172
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,349
<i>Is making his way onto pit road
with McQueen on his tail.</i>

173
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:26,228
<i>A good stop here could mean
the difference between victory and defeat.</i>

174
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,106
Come on, come on. Come on!
Faster, guido, come on.

175
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:32,276
I got to get back out there before
he does. Guido, hurry up!

176
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:33,736
<i>Fatto, fatto.</i>

177
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:39,241
<i>What a pit stop by McQueen!
Man, he just got the lead!</i>

178
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,035
<i>But can he hold on to it?</i>

179
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,377
Hey, McQueen, are you all right?
Listen, don't you worry, pal.

180
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,422
You had a good run. Enjoy your retirement!

181
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,132
<i>Storm takes back the lead!</i>

182
00:12:55,299 --> 00:13:00,554
<i>Unbelievable! McQueen is fading!
McQueen is fading! Fading fast!</i>

183
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,892
No.No!No!No!

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,394
No!

185
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:03,441
<i>W-h-l-z</i>

186
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,067
<i>welcome back to piston cup talk.</i>

187
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:09,071
<i>Around the clock where we do nothing
but talk racing. Let's get to it.</i>

188
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:11,324
<i>Starting of course with lightning McQueen.</i>

189
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:15,620
<i>With the season just two weeks away,
there's still no official announcement.</i>

190
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:18,956
<i>But with number 95 coming off
his worst year on record--</i>

191
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:21,584
<i>don't shoot the messenger here, folks.
I think it's safe to assume...</i>

192
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:25,080
<i>That lightning McQueen's
racing days are over.</i>

193
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,375
<i>Meanwhile, Jackson storm
is looking even faster--</i>

194
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,133
<i>for the checkered flag.</i>

195
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:39,637
<i>As they enter the final lap,
the number 6 and number 12 cars...</i>

196
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:43,766
<i>Are still fighting it out for the lead.
But wait! Here he comes!</i>

197
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,936
<i>It's the fabulous Hudson hornet
knocking at their door.</i>

198
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:51,315
<i>What's he got up his sleeve today?
And there it is!</i>

199
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:56,153
<i>With one move, he's past them.
The hornet takes a decisive lead.</i>

200
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:02,284
<i>He's left the pack behind.
His crew chief, smokey, is loving it!</i>

201
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,829
<i>It's unbelievable! No! He's in trouble!</i>

202
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:11,126
<i>The Hudson hornet has lost control!</i>

203
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:18,008
<i>What should have been a scene
of jubilation has turned tragic, folks.</i>

204
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:20,678
<i>As we await news
on the Hudson hornet's condition.</i>

205
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:22,930
<i>After such a devastating crash...</i>

206
00:15:23,097 --> 00:15:26,517
<i>We can only hope that
this race today wasn't his last.</i>

207
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:35,854
<i>When I finally got put together,
i went back expecting a big welcome.</i>

208
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,482
You know what they said? You're history.

209
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,527
Moved right on to the next rookie
standing in line.

210
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,825
There was a lot left in me
i never got a chance to show.

211
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,136
Hey, stickers.

212
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:10,013
Hey, sal.

213
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,056
How you feeling?

214
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:17,270
Yeah, great. Really, really great.

215
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:19,856
Been thinking about doc again?

216
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,029
Yeah. You know they told him
when he was done.

217
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,406
He didn't decide.

218
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:33,161
I don't want what happened to doc
to happen to me.

219
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:34,829
But that hasn't happened.

220
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,460
No, but I can't go out on the track
and do the same old thing. It won't work.

221
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,754
Then change it up! Try something new.

222
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:46,508
- I don't know, Sally. I--
- don't fear failure.

223
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:51,095
Be afraid of not having the chance.
You have the chance. Doc didn't.

224
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:55,600
And you can either take it or you can
do what you been doing. Sitting.

225
00:16:55,767 --> 00:17:00,688
In here. For months. And by the way,
i love what you've done with the place.

226
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:04,526
I mean the monster movie lighting
and the musky air freshener.

227
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,530
Don't let anyone tell you
you're not working that primer because...

228
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,573
I have never found you more attractive.

229
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,785
And now that I've been in here
for a couple minutes, the stench...

230
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:17,455
-I'm getting kind of used to it.
- Okay, sal. I get it. I get it.

231
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,543
I miss you, lightning. We all do.

232
00:17:26,965 --> 00:17:28,633
Try something new, huh?

233
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:32,011
Hey, did it work, miss Sally?

234
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:35,473
Did you set him straight
with your lawyerly powers of persuasion?

235
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,350
Is he ready to start training?

236
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,519
Well, stinky--
stickers?

237
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:43,648
Yes, mater, I am.

238
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,569
I decide when I'm done.

239
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:51,197
- I was hoping you'd say that.
- Okay, but I got an idea.

240
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:53,324
And I'm gonna need to talk to rusty
and dusty, all right?

241
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,995
I'll get them on the horn.
Get it? On the horn?

242
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,374
Oops. Hold on. Got to sneeze.

243
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:09,173
Dadgum, I lost it.
Hey, I'll see you at flo's.

244
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,510
I found it.

245
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:14,137
Hey, watch your step.

246
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,840
<i>What about the car from Everett?
Remember him?</i>

247
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:22,010
<i>He was stuck in reverse! I said, you
need a house with a circular driveway!</i>

248
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:27,349
You need to get your rusty tails down
here. I created a drink in your honor.

249
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:30,352
Yeah! The rust-eze medicated
bumper bomb.

250
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,355
It goes down faster than an elevator
full of winnebagos.

251
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:36,358
- Rusty and dusty!
- Well, look who's here.

252
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:38,986
<i>There he is! Good to see you, lightning!</i>

253
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:41,989
Thanks, guys. You're all here.

254
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:44,658
Sorry, buddy,
did you want this call to be private?

255
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:49,705
No, mater. This is perfect. Listen,
thanks, everyone, for sticking by me.

256
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:53,083
It took me a while to figure it out,
but I know now that it's time...

257
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,127
For me to make some changes.

258
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:59,882
- Changes? What kind of changes?
-Lt's futile to resist change, man.

259
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,050
- You're right, Fillmore.
- Really?

260
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:04,678
Which is why
i have an announcement to make.

261
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,681
I've thought long and hard about it.

262
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:11,518
Done a lot of soul-searching
and considered all of the options.

263
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,730
And I've finally decided...

264
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:17,774
You do want to keep racing?

265
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:20,193
Are you kidding?
Of course I want to keep racing!

266
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,571
- Thank goodness!
- Glad to hear it. All right.

267
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:26,491
Man, for a second i--
wait a minute. I knew that the whole time.

268
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,119
Guys! I'm talking about
making this my best season yet!

269
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,913
<i>We were hoping you'd say that.</i>

270
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,708
The thing is, if I'm gonna be faster than
storm, I need to train like him.

271
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,084
<i>We're way ahead of you, buddy!</i>

272
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:38,921
<i>Lightning, we want you on the road
first thing in the morning...</i>

273
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:41,715
<i>So you can come out
and see the brand-new...</i>

274
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,384
<i>Rust-eze racing center!</i>

275
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,930
<i>- It's wicked awesome.
- What? Rust-eze racing center?</i>

276
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,267
<i>It's got all the fancy bells and whistles
that kids are training on these days.</i>

277
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:55,938
<i>We'll send macky boy all the directions.
Now get moving, all right?</i>

278
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,482
Qkay! Yes!

279
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:01,276
- Fancy new training center?
- That sounds nice!

280
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:03,612
Guido, come! We have to pack the tires!

281
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,783
Hey, McQueen! You can't race
in primer, man. Come on! Let's go.

282
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:14,081
Ramone, you have done it again.

283
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:17,834
It's like the sistine chapel on wheels.

284
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,462
I'm coming for you, storm.

285
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:25,133
Morning, McQueen! Hey, look at you.

286
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,760
He looks so good!

287
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,348
Welcome back. You look different.

288
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:34,184
- Obviously.
- You look ready.

289
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:36,812
<i>Guido, come! Scusi, scusi.
Tires coming through.</i>

290
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,648
Go kick those rookies in the trunk.

291
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,274
All right, bye.

292
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,944
- Catch you on the flipside.
- I'll see you guys in Florida.

293
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:46,363
- See you, McQueen.
- Don't forget to call me.

294
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:47,864
Good luck in college.

295
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:53,453
- Hey, sal. Thanks.
- Anytime.

296
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,615
- Love you!
- Love you more.

297
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,329
Rust-eze racing center, here we come!
Good times ahead.

298
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,171
<i>When the time gets right</i>

299
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,633
<i>I'm gonna pick you up</i>

300
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,261
<i>and take you far away from</i>

301
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,556
<i>from trouble, my love</i>

302
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,018
<i>under a big old sky</i>

303
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,813
<i>out in a field of green</i>

304
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,151
<i>there's got to be something</i>

305
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:36,321
<i>left for us to believe</i>

306
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:40,659
<i>oh, I await the day</i>

307
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:44,371
<i>good fortune comes our way</i>

308
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,832
<i>and we'll ride down the king's highway</i>

309
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,378
<i>yeah, yeah
yeah</i>

310
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,856
- McQueen, over here!
- McQueen, how you feeling?

311
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,567
Have you seen the latest records
storm's been setting?

312
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,235
Have you given any thought to retirement?

313
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:19,072
Okay, that's enough. No questions!
Scusi. Out of the way!

314
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,741
Coming through! Okay, back up. Back up!
No pictures. No, no, no.

315
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:25,908
Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

316
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:30,079
- Guido, can you believe them?
- Paparazzi.

317
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:45,302
Looks good, doesn't it?

318
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:47,304
- Hey, guys.
- What do you think?

319
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:49,765
What do I think? It's unbelievable.

320
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:53,769
Yeah, you know, it's kind of a cozy,
humble, little place.

321
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,938
Guys, how did you ever do this?

322
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,565
- You want to tell him or should I?
- No, you start. Go ahead.

323
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:01,318
We sold rust-eze.

324
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:03,570
What?

325
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,824
What? You think a couple ofjabronis
like us could do this on our own?

326
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:09,243
- Wait. You sold rust-eze?
-Lt's all good news.

327
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,122
We just realized that you needed
something that we couldn't give you.

328
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:15,624
It felt like
the time was right for us too.

329
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,459
I mean, we're not as young and handsome
as we look.

330
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:19,128
That's true.

331
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:23,382
Besides, this Sterling fellow? He's got
every high-tech thing you'll ever need.

332
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:25,968
Everything we wanted to give you,
but couldn't.

333
00:23:26,802 --> 00:23:28,637
Sterling? Who's Sterling?

334
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:32,307
Lightning McQueen!
You made some serious time, partner.

335
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:37,229
Your new sponsor. He's the
mudflap king of the eastern seaboard.

336
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,982
Welcome to
the rust-eze racing center!

337
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:43,986
You have no idea how much
I've been looking forward to this.

338
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:47,781
- Thanks, Mr.--
- please. No "mister". Just Sterling.

339
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,826
I have been a fan of yours forever.
And to be your sponsor?

340
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:53,996
How great is that?
I can't thank rusty and dusty here enough.

341
00:23:54,163 --> 00:23:55,664
Tough negotiators by the way.

342
00:23:55,831 --> 00:23:57,833
You flatter us, but don't stop!

343
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:02,838
Anyway, just wanted to say a quick hello.
Take as much time as you need.

344
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,256
Door's always open, guys.

345
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,177
See?

346
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:21,104
I sure am gonna miss racing for you guys.

347
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:26,526
You know, you gave us
a lot of great memories, lightning.

348
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:29,028
Memories we'll remember.

349
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,322
That's good.

350
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:36,286
- Hey, lightning, whatever you do--
- don't drive like my brother!

351
00:24:36,453 --> 00:24:39,497
- Don't drive like my brother.
- Please no pictures.

352
00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:41,791
Okay, maybe one.
Get my good side though, will you?

353
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:07,901
So? You like it?

354
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:13,740
Hey, Mr. Sterling.
My career on a wall.

355
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:16,743
Nice that you included doc.

356
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,329
Of course. He was your mentor.

357
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:22,707
Losing him left a giant hole in the sport.

358
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:27,921
Yeah. Jars of dirt?

359
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:29,547
Sacred dirt.

360
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,259
Each of those jars contains dirt
from all the old tracks that doc raced on.

361
00:25:33,426 --> 00:25:37,055
Florida international, thunder hollow,
just down the road and...

362
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:40,016
Our very own fireball beach,
right outside.

363
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,184
Hey, is that--

364
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:44,936
a bit of asphalt from Glen Ellen.

365
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:49,357
My first win! You really are a fan.

366
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:54,571
I am. And a fan of your future.
You ready for it?

367
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,574
Definitely.

368
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:01,286
First, let's get you into a more...
Contemporary look.

369
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:13,465
<i>It's an electronic suit.</i>

370
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:16,593
<i>With it we'll be able to track your speed
and your vital signs.</i>

371
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,719
Does it have a phone?

372
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,764
<i>Don't be crazy.
Racecars don't have phones.</i>

373
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,061
- Not bad, huh?
- This is really impressive.

374
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:29,272
This center has quickly become
the most coveted destination...

375
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,399
For young racers training
to make our team someday.

376
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:34,402
And it's where you'll train
until you leave for Florida.

377
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:38,156
Treadmills, wind tunnels, virtual reality.

378
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:41,117
Still working on that.

379
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:44,662
And the best fitness regimen
anyone could possibly imagine.

380
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:48,875
Wait. Wait.
Ls that the simulator?

381
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,168
Yes.

382
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:53,505
Lightning, I'd like to introduce you
to the multi-million dollar...

383
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:56,174
Flagship of interactive race simulation.

384
00:26:56,841 --> 00:27:01,012
The xdl 24-gts mark z.

385
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:06,017
The xdl... etcetera.

386
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,812
Jackson storm wishes he had this model.

387
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,071
- That was amazing.
- Awesome. Yeah!

388
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:20,865
It's just like being on a real track,
so put your hours in.

389
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:24,369
Okay, let's hit the treadmills.
Come on. Show me what you got!

390
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:29,541
- Pretty fast. Who's the racer?
- No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.

391
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:32,961
Cruz Ramirez.
The best trainer in the business.

392
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:35,130
Ready to meet it, greet it and defeat it?

393
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,174
All right. Now bring up those rpms!

394
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:40,051
Like the attitude.

395
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:42,554
Yeah, we call her
our maestro of motivation.

396
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,556
You're driving
a little tense again, Ronald.

397
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:48,268
- No, no. I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Do your exercise.

398
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:54,357
I am a fluffy cloud! I am a fluffy cloud!
I am a fluffy cloud.

399
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:55,567
There you go!

400
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,485
- You're a cloud.
- Shut up, Kurt!

401
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:59,112
Here come the bugs, Kurt. You ready?

402
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,909
Hey, I kept my eyes open this time!

403
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:08,997
Got to see that track.
No. Homesick again, Gabriel?

404
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,165
<i>Si.</i>

405
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:15,753
<i>Santa Cecilia! Mi pueblo!</i>

406
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:17,046
Win for them!

407
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:20,341
She trains young racers
to push through their own obstacles.

408
00:28:20,592 --> 00:28:24,345
Tailor-made for each one.
Now, she's gonna work with you.

409
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:27,599
Let's go! Let's go!
You guys got to work through this stuff...

410
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:29,767
So when your big chance comes along
you can take it.

411
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:32,604
- Hey, Cruz.
- Hey, Mr. Sterling!

412
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,440
I'd like to introduce you
to lightning McQueen.

413
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:36,941
I hear you're the maestro.

414
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:40,195
Mr. Sterling, did you say lightning
McQueen was here because...

415
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,113
I don't see him anywhere.

416
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:45,617
But he's right here.
Do you not see him?

417
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:47,076
Nope, still don't see him.

418
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:50,580
He's right in front of you!
It's lightning McQueen!

419
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:55,752
He's obviously an imposter. He looks
old and broken down with flabby tires.

420
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,462
- Hey! I do not!
- Use that!

421
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:00,548
Yeah, I see.

422
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,509
I can use that energy
for motivation, right?

423
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:06,429
It's all about motivation, Mr. McQueen.

424
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:10,308
You can use anything negative as fuel
to push through to the positive.

425
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:13,645
I've been pretty positive
ever since I was a rookie.

426
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:17,982
I am so excited that I get to train you.
I grew up watching you on TV.

427
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:20,109
Is that right?

428
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,029
These young guys are great and all,
but I like a challenge.

429
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:28,493
- L'm not that much older, but--
- in fact, I call you my senior project.

430
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:35,500
We need to loosen those ancient joints.
First the wheels.

431
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,295
And forward, and rest,
and forward, and rest.

432
00:29:39,462 --> 00:29:41,714
Join me! Rest. And rest.

433
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,383
Is all this resting necessary?

434
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:46,344
We're working you in slowly.
And reach for your lunch.

435
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:51,432
Reach for your lunch.
Now reach, to the front.

436
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,019
What is there? It's your lunch.

437
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:58,856
Now backwards. Ls lunch there?

438
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:00,149
When do we go on the simulator?

439
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,569
Good morning, Mr. McQueen. Looking good.

440
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:06,364
Why?

441
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:10,368
This'll get oil to places it hasn't been
in a long time.

442
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,997
- Is that a drip pan?
- Just in case.

443
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:15,581
How old do you think I am?

444
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:20,003
Visualize yourself driving fast down
a steep hill. I'll be back in a few.

445
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,009
Visualize... wait. Cruz! A few what?
I just want to go on the simulator.

446
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,428
How's it hanging, drip pan?

447
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:39,188
-'Sup.
- Okay, day three:

448
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:43,109
Treadmill. I've set a maximum speed
to conserve your energy.

449
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,863
What I want you to do is
visualize beating this guy.

450
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,741
- Storm!
- That's right.

451
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:51,159
Get him! Get him, Mr. McQueen!

452
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,287
Get him? This thing's only going
like 5 miles an hour!

453
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:57,206
We'll work up to the higher speeds
right after you take your nap.

454
00:30:57,498 --> 00:30:59,334
Nap? I don't need a nap!

455
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:04,589
- Hit him with the bugs!
- I am not taking a nap!

456
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:07,425
<i>All cars in the test bay simulator--</i>

457
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,094
how was your nap, Mr. McQueen?

458
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,930
It was kind of refreshing actually.

459
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:15,099
Okay, what are you-- hey!

460
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,393
You've been driving on tires a long time.

461
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,479
Have you ever stopped to get to know them?

462
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:20,688
I'm sorry, what?

463
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:23,775
Tires are individuals.
You should give each a name.

464
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,861
Name them? I won't be doing that.

465
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,822
Mine are named Maria, juanita, Ronaldo,
and Debbie Richardson.

466
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:31,449
- What?
- Long story.

467
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:34,035
May I have my tires back
so I can go on the simulator please?

468
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:34,911
Name them!

469
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,914
Lefty, righty, backy, backy junior. Okay?

470
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,749
- Does this make you mad?
- Yes, it does!

471
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:44,295
Use that! And merge, and yield,
and merge, and yield.

472
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,383
Beep,beep,beep,beep.
Now you got some tire damage.

473
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:52,011
Speed bump, speed bump.
Now clean up your messy garage.

474
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:57,100
- Bug in your windshield.
- Thank you, Cruz, I'm done.

475
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,019
Mr. McQueen, where are you going?

476
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,354
To the future.

477
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:08,486
Okay. Here we go.
How do I do this? Come on, baby.

478
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:09,320
Mr. McQueen--

479
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:12,865
Cruz, thank you for the old-man training,
as crazy as it was, but I'm...

480
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,451
Warmed up enough
and now I need you to launch this thing.

481
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:18,996
Wait until you can handle it. Please?
There are no shortcuts.

482
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:20,832
Okay. We'll just see about that.

483
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:23,918
All right.
My star racer is on the simulator!

484
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:25,461
Why, yes, I am!

485
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,797
Well, let's see you take it out
for a spin.

486
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:31,634
Right away, Mr. Sterling,
owner of the company.

487
00:32:34,303 --> 00:32:35,972
Okay. Have fun.

488
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:41,644
This is what I'm talking about.
Didn't know about those.

489
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:45,648
<i>Prepare to race. The green flag is out.</i>

490
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,442
I don't see the flag. What do I do?

491
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:48,609
- Go.
- Go?

492
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:53,072
That's sensitive.

493
00:32:54,198 --> 00:32:55,491
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

494
00:32:55,658 --> 00:32:56,993
It shouldn't be this hard, should it?

495
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,077
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

496
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,122
You're fighting the simulator.
Just race like you always do.

497
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,291
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

498
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,792
There can't be this many walls
on a regular track!

499
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,665
<i>You have been passed by Jackson storm.</i>

500
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:10,251
- Wait, storm's in here?
- For motivation.

501
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:13,630
Storm races at 207.
Pick it up, Mr. McQueen!

502
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,964
L'm trying!

503
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,678
<i>You have hit a wall.</i>

504
00:33:20,845 --> 00:33:23,598
Mr. McQueen, come down from there
and we'll work you up to this.

505
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,309
I am fine, Cruz. I can do it, okay?

506
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:30,688
<i>You have jumped a barrier.</i>

507
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:33,525
Sorry!

508
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:37,028
<i>You have maimed two vehicles.
You have destroyed a drinking fountain.</i>

509
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:42,033
<i>You have disabled an ambulance.</i>

510
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:45,703
<i>You are on fire. Danger. Danger.</i>

511
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:48,039
<i>You are going the wrong way.</i>

512
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:49,916
Look out! Turn it off!

513
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,043
Get these things off of me!

514
00:33:55,797 --> 00:33:58,174
<i>You have crashed. You have crashed.</i>

515
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,708
<i>- Are you all right?
- You have crashed.</i>

516
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:02,668
I have crashed.

517
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:10,551
- It's not easy for him.
- Cruz, just relax.

518
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,178
- Give him another chance.
- I will talk to him.

519
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:15,389
- I can still work with him.
- I know he's your project.

520
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,849
- Are you sure?
- Cruz.

521
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,267
- Well, can't you just--
- Cruz.

522
00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:20,978
- It's not easy for him.
- Look, I'm trying to help you.

523
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:24,106
You're all warshed up, McQueen.

524
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,900
I'm sorry. What?

525
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,653
I said,
the floor's all washed up and clean.

526
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,363
Right.

527
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,199
Thank you very much.

528
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:35,993
Good luck.

529
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:41,290
Hey, lightning. Come on in.
Got something to show you. You ready?

530
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,000
For what?

531
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:51,708
You are about to become
the biggest brand in racing.

532
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:56,004
We are talking saturation on all
continents for every demographic.

533
00:34:56,171 --> 00:34:59,299
Movie deals, infomercials,
product endorsements.

534
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,844
Mudflaps?
- Of course.

535
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:05,055
We'll be rich beyond belief.
You think you're famous now?

536
00:35:06,723 --> 00:35:08,976
I thought you'd be mad
about the simulator.

537
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:12,354
I mean, this is all great, Mr. Sterling,
i guess, but I don't know.

538
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:14,648
I've never really thought of myself
as a brand.

539
00:35:15,148 --> 00:35:20,821
Nor do I. I'm a fan. Maybe your most avid.
I think of this as your legacy!

540
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,660
It sounds like something that happens
after you're done racing.

541
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,540
Mr. Sterling, what is this about?

542
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:35,168
Look, lightning. I'm not gonna race you.

543
00:35:35,502 --> 00:35:37,588
What? What do you mean not race me?

544
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,007
- Hold on. Hold on.
-L'm not going to Florida?

545
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:45,387
You have no idea how excited I was
to get you here because...

546
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,851
I knew you'd be back. It was gonna be
the comeback story of the year!

547
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:55,439
But your speed and performance
just aren't where they need to be.

548
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,065
I'm sorry.

549
00:35:57,357 --> 00:36:00,903
We're talking about speed on a simulator.

550
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:03,405
- Listen to how crazy that sounds.
- Look, I'm trying to help you.

551
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:06,783
As your sponsor, yes,
but also as your friend.

552
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,037
Your racing days are coming to an end.

553
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:12,956
Every time you lose, you damage yourself.

554
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:15,334
Damage the brand, you mean?

555
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,795
Lightning, come on. You've done the work.

556
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:22,049
Now move on to the next phase
and reap the reward.

557
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:27,638
The racing is the reward. Not the stuff.
I don't want to cash in.

558
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:30,057
I want to feel the rush
of moving 200 miles an hour...

559
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:33,393
Inches from the other guys, pushing myself
faster than I thought I could go!

560
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,979
That's the reward, Mr. Sterling!

561
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:38,023
Lightning, come on.

562
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:44,738
Look, loan do this. Loan, I promise!
I'll train like I did with doc.

563
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:48,116
I'll get my tires dirty
on every dirt track from here to Florida.

564
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,237
I can start on fireball beach
where all the old greats used to race.

565
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:56,574
Get your tires dirty. That's how
you're gonna get faster than storm?

566
00:36:56,741 --> 00:37:00,411
Yes! Exactly! I mean, sacred dirt, right?

567
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:05,416
Mr. Sterling, if you care about
my legacy, the one that doc started,

568
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,962
you'll let me do this.
I promise you, I will win.

569
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:12,465
I don't know.
What you're asking, it's too risky.

570
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:15,635
Come on. You like it, I can tell.

571
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,848
It's got that little "comeback story
of the year" feel to it, doesn't it?

572
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,186
One race?

573
00:37:27,939 --> 00:37:30,066
If you don't win at Florida,
you'll retire?

574
00:37:30,441 --> 00:37:33,361
Look, if I don't win
I'll sell all the mudflaps you got.

575
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:38,283
But if I do win,
i decide when I'm done. Deal?

576
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:41,161
Deal.

577
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:44,539
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
You won't be sorry.

578
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:47,834
Just one thing and this is only because
i don't like taking chances.

579
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,836
You're taking someone with you.

580
00:37:57,385 --> 00:38:00,471
You talked him into it!
Way to go, Mr. McQueen!

581
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,140
Cruz.

582
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:05,143
You could talk a snowmobile
into an air conditioner.

583
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,645
You're going with me? With that thing?

584
00:38:07,854 --> 00:38:12,317
Yeah. You still need my help.
You're brittle like a fossil.

585
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:20,700
- We got the cable.
- I don't need a trainer out here, Cruz.

586
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:24,329
You're old! What if you fall on this beach
and can't get up?

587
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:27,832
Well, life's a beach and then you drive.

588
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:31,878
- McQueen.
- Thank you.

589
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,841
This is beautiful. I can see why Mr.
Sterling said you wanted to train here.

590
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:39,886
As soon as this thing's booted up,
we'll get you on the treadmill...

591
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:42,347
-And I'll track your speed.
- What? No!

592
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:46,351
The whole idea is getting my tires dirty.
Real racing.

593
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:50,021
I'm not driving on that thing when
I've got the sand and the whole earth.

594
00:38:52,148 --> 00:38:54,859
- Okay.
- Luigi, let's do this.

595
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,862
Welcome, racers, to fireball beach!

596
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:01,741
Historic home
for today's great test of speed.

597
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:05,870
Our finish line will be
the abandoned pier in the distance.

598
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:11,251
All right. Quicker than quick,
faster than fast, I am speed--

599
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:14,879
that is great self-motivation.
Did you come up with that?

600
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:19,384
- Yeah, I did.
- On your mark. Get set. Go!

601
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:37,402
There you go! Felt good!
Hey, what was my speed?

602
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,904
I don't know.
I can only track you on the treadmill.

603
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:41,364
No treadmills!

604
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,409
- What about Hamilton?
- Hamilton here.

605
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,412
- Who's Hamilton?
- My electronic personal assistant.

606
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:51,082
You know, like on your phone.
You do have a phone, don't you?

607
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,751
Racecars don't have phones, Cruz.

608
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:56,421
Hamilton, track Mr. McQueen's speed
and report it.

609
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:58,965
- Tracking.
- I'll stay as close as I can.

610
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:01,092
Your suit will transmit your speeds
to Hamilton.

611
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:03,553
Fine. Whatever. Let's do this.

612
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:08,141
Quicker than quick, faster than fast,
i am speed. Come on, Luigi.

613
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:10,810
On your mark, get set, and go!

614
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,983
<i>46 miles per hour. 63 miles. Out of range.</i>

615
00:40:19,193 --> 00:40:21,612
That's odd. I didn't go!

616
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,285
On sand you got to ease into your start
so your tires can grab, okay?

617
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:30,330
- Okay.
- You do work with racecars, don't you?

618
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:33,458
- Yeah, but never outside.
- All right. Let's go again.

619
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:34,500
Go!

620
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:41,758
<i>54 miles per hour. 75 miles per hour.
Out of range.</i>

621
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:46,763
Sorry! Got stuck!

622
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:49,307
- G<> again!
- Al'1d go!

623
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:51,768
- Sorryq
- 60!

624
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:53,811
Go!

625
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:58,608
The beach ate me.

626
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:01,778
All right, Cruz,
pick a line on the compacted sand.

627
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:05,323
You got to have traction or you're
gonna spin out. Let's do this thing!

628
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:07,158
On your mark, get set, go!

629
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:13,915
<i>122 miles per hour. 134 miles--
out of range.</i>

630
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:17,126
- Now what?
- I didn't want to hit a crab!

631
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:20,171
- You got to be kidding me.
- What? It was cute!

632
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:26,469
All right, one last chance to try this
before it gets dark.

633
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:29,680
Now, you're going to take off slow
to let your tires grab.

634
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:33,184
And pick a straight line on hard sand
so you don't spin out.

635
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:36,854
And all of the crabbies
have gone night-night.

636
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,690
- Mr. McQueen.
- All right. Let's go again.

637
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:41,192
And go!

638
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:48,658
<i>150 miles per hour. 175 miles per hour.</i>

639
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:51,369
<i>196 miles per hour.</i>

640
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,668
All right! Finally! You made it!
Congratulations! How'd I do?

641
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:00,211
You topped out at 198.

642
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,046
198? That's it?

643
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,631
Still slower than storm.

644
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:07,135
Wasted my whole day.

645
00:42:07,301 --> 00:42:08,386
I wouldn't say that.

646
00:42:08,553 --> 00:42:11,806
It did feel great to be out here
doing real racing.

647
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:14,559
This isn't real racing. We're on a beach!

648
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:17,311
All you do is go straight.
How am I gonna get faster if I don't--

649
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:25,987
thunder hollow. Thunder hollow!
There's a dirt track there!

650
00:42:26,154 --> 00:42:29,574
That's what I need!
To race against actual racers.

651
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:35,705
No! Too public! If the press find you,
they will be like many bugs on you.

652
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:38,416
- Paparazzi!
- Guys, I really need this!

653
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:43,212
Just leave it to me, boss.
I am a master of disguise.

654
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:56,055
All right! Next!

655
00:43:05,356 --> 00:43:09,235
You, sir, are officially incognito.
Nobody's bothering you.

656
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,695
The great lightning McQueen.

657
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:15,866
I can feel it, guys.
Tonight is the night I find my speed!

658
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:19,829
<i>Racers, get on over
to the startin' line. Pronto!</i>

659
00:43:21,622 --> 00:43:25,584
All right! No more straight lines.
Just a good old-fashioned oval.

660
00:43:25,955 --> 00:43:27,623
Hey, now! You that out-of-towner?

661
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:30,918
Yes. That's me! Chester whipplefilter.

662
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:33,880
And I'm Frances beltline.

663
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:35,965
- Cruz, what are you doing?
-L'm your trainer.

664
00:43:36,132 --> 00:43:38,968
I'm gonna track your speed
from the infield, whipplefilter.

665
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:41,179
Fine. Just stay out of the way.

666
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:44,057
Excuse me, sir?
Where are the other racers?

667
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:50,063
They'll be along. We always
let our guests start right up front.

668
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:56,110
<i>Welcome, y'all,
to thunder hollow speedway...</i>

669
00:43:56,861 --> 00:44:02,158
<i>For tonight's edition of crazy eight!</i>

670
00:44:12,043 --> 00:44:13,503
Did he say crazy eight?

671
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:15,963
<i>Race fans!</i>

672
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:19,884
<i>It's time to meet tonight's challengers!</i>

673
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:25,014
Have a nice trip!

674
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:27,725
Protect and swerve!

675
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:38,194
Cruz! This isn't what I thought it was.
Come on, follow me and we'll slip out.

676
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:43,357
Rule number one:
The gate closes, you race.

677
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,026
Wait! No, no, no. I'm not a racer.

678
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,987
Rule number two:
Last car standing wins.

679
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:52,866
And rule number three:
No cursing! It's family night.

680
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,245
- Excuse me, sir?
- Wait. No, I'm just a trainer!

681
00:44:59,036 --> 00:45:02,248
<i>And make way for the undefeated
crazy eight champion...</i>

682
00:45:02,623 --> 00:45:07,628
<i>The diva of demolition, miss fritter!</i>

683
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:11,924
Boo!

684
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:16,429
Lookie here, boys.
We got us a couple of rookies.

685
00:45:16,596 --> 00:45:21,434
I'm gonna call you muddy britches
and you lemonade.

686
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:24,145
Hey, neither one of them
has a single dent.

687
00:45:24,312 --> 00:45:26,189
I'm gonna fix that!

688
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:32,862
<i>All right, everybody! Let's go racing!</i>

689
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:41,120
I'm about to commit a moving violation.

690
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:43,080
<i>Boo!</i>

691
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:54,550
Cruz!

692
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:55,927
Watch out.

693
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:58,804
What are you doing? Got to keep moving!

694
00:45:58,971 --> 00:45:59,931
I shouldn't be out here!

695
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,433
Move, Cruz! Move!

696
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:04,393
What do I do? I can't steer!

697
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,686
Turn right to go left!
Turn right to go left!

698
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:08,606
- That doesn't make any sense!
- Turn right to go left!

699
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:17,406
Hey, Patty.
- Hey, bill!

700
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:30,795
Look, ma, I can drive--
oh, man!

701
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:34,507
Nice day for a drive, huh?

702
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:36,634
Hey, buddy! Get the...Out of my way!

703
00:46:40,012 --> 00:46:41,556
Hey! I'm driving--

704
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:49,480
look at my new hat!

705
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,988
I'm flying! No! I'm not flying!

706
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,365
Get it. Get it.

707
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:01,158
' Qot it!

708
00:47:03,828 --> 00:47:05,079
Cruz!

709
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:15,548
Hey, buddy! Move it!

710
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:18,467
Turn right to go left.
Turn right to go left.

711
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:26,058
- Here I come, boy!
- No, no, no!

712
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:31,856
No.

713
00:47:32,815 --> 00:47:34,108
<i>Buckle up, everybody!</i>

714
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:37,144
<i>It's fritter time!</i>

715
00:47:38,646 --> 00:47:41,399
Fritter! Fritter!

716
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,443
Fritter! Fritter! Fritter!

717
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,820
We love you, miss fritter.

718
00:47:46,612 --> 00:47:52,201
Yeah! Your license plate's gonna look
real nice in my collection.

719
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:54,245
- Oh, boy.
- Run!

720
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:56,705
No.

721
00:47:57,123 --> 00:47:59,834
Remember,
obey all appropriate street signs.

722
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,835
Cruz!

723
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:09,385
H ey__

724
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:15,015
<i>oh, my gracious! Miss fritter's down!</i>

725
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:25,818
Nobody touches him. He is mine!

726
00:48:27,778 --> 00:48:29,738
You gonna get it now, whipplefilter!

727
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:34,869
Come on, McQueen. You can do it.
Come on, lightning, keep going.

728
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:39,540
<i>Miss fritter is looking to get upright,
folks. And she is not pleased.</i>

729
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:42,418
- Get up. Get up!
- Fritter! Fritter!

730
00:48:43,002 --> 00:48:46,088
You about to feel the wrath of the...

731
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:48,883
Lower belleville county
unified school district!

732
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:55,764
What the-- wait--

733
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:59,310
no, no, no! No! No!

734
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:06,275
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!
Frances beltline!</i>

735
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:09,778
Ls that me? That's me! I won! I won!

736
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:11,822
- Cruz! Cruz! No!
- Watch out!

737
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:32,760
Whipplefilter?

738
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,558
It's lightning McQueen!

739
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:43,812
McQueen!

740
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:49,318
<i>Fans here at thunder hollow
still buzzing over tonight's...</i>

741
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:51,654
<i>Unexpected appearance
of lightning McQueen.</i>

742
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,405
<i>He has always been my favorite!</i>

743
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:56,700
<i>My garage is covered from head to toe
with 95 posters.</i>

744
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:59,537
<i>Tell our listeners at home you weren't
really trying to wreck him, were you?</i>

745
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:01,956
So trophy's kind of nice.
Don't you think?

746
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:06,835
I mean, I know you got like a billion
of them, so you would know.

747
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:13,509
I still can't believe I won. It's pretty
shiny. I have never seen one up close.

748
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:17,221
Looks like they spent a lot of money
on it. I mean, I think it's real metal.

749
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:20,015
Stop. Just stop, okay, Cruz?
You don't even know.

750
00:50:20,182 --> 00:50:23,269
- You don't even have one clue--
- hey! I was just trying--

751
00:50:23,435 --> 00:50:25,813
do you know what happens
if I lose this race?

752
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:31,193
Every mile of this trip was to get me
faster than Jackson storm. Faster!

753
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,488
I started off getting nowhere for a week
on a simulator!

754
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:36,861
I lose a whole day with you
on fireball beach.

755
00:50:37,028 --> 00:50:40,364
And then I waste tonight
in the crosshairs of miss fritter!

756
00:50:40,698 --> 00:50:43,117
I'm stuck in the same speed I was
a month ago!

757
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:47,497
I can't get any faster because I'm
too busy taking care of my trainer!

758
00:50:48,873 --> 00:50:53,211
<i>This is my last chance, Cruz.
Last! Final! Finito!</i>

759
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:57,715
If I lose, I never get to do this again.
If you were a racer...

760
00:50:57,882 --> 00:51:02,053
You'd know what I'm talking about
but you're not! So you don't.

761
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:11,103
- Mack! Pull over!
- What? Now?

762
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:15,024
- Now!
- Okay! Pulling over!

763
00:51:21,072 --> 00:51:23,908
Ask me if I dreamed of being a trainer,
Mr. McQueen. Go ahead.

764
00:51:25,243 --> 00:51:30,289
Ask me if I got up in the dark
to run laps before school every day.

765
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:33,626
Ask me if I saved every penny
to buy a ticket to the races

766
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:35,503
when they came to town.

767
00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:39,757
Ask me if I did that so I could
be a trainer someday. Ask me.

768
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:42,426
- No!

769
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:48,015
I've wanted to become a racer forever!
Because of you!

770
00:51:53,604 --> 00:51:57,024
I used to watch you on TV,
flying through the air.

771
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:01,821
You seemed so... fearless.

772
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:08,786
"Dream small, Cruz,"
that's what my family used to say.

773
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:11,539
"Dream small or not at all."

774
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:15,960
They were just trying to protect me.

775
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:22,258
But I was the fastest kid in town
and I was gonna prove them wrong.

776
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,636
What happened?

777
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:30,600
When I got to my first race,
i figured it out.

778
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,060
What?

779
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:40,227
That I didn't belong.
The other racers looked nothing like me.

780
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,192
They were bigger and stronger
and so... confident.

781
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:53,782
And when they started their engines,
that was it...

782
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:56,285
I knew I'd never be a racer.

783
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:05,836
L just left. It was my one shot
and I didn't take it.

784
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:16,013
Yeah, so, I'm gonna head back
to the training center.

785
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,849
I think we both know it's for the best.

786
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:24,146
But can I ask you something?

787
00:53:26,815 --> 00:53:30,819
What was it like for you?
When you showed up to your first race?

788
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:33,780
How did you know you could do it?

789
00:53:35,823 --> 00:53:39,077
I don't know.
I just never thought I couldn't.

790
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,083
I wish I knew what that felt like.

791
00:53:47,752 --> 00:53:49,420
Good luck, Mr. McQueen.

792
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:53,800
Cruz. Cruz, wait.

793
00:53:57,762 --> 00:54:00,807
<i>And earn your physics degree
from the comfort of your own home--</i>

794
00:54:00,973 --> 00:54:04,227
<i>you'll get that and a $200 gift,
for $29.95.</i>

795
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:06,729
<i>- Now look here, warden...
- No! He's got a Jack!</i>

796
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,022
<i>Autos over 100,000 miles
also reported trouble sleeping.</i>

797
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:13,650
<i>You could have 12 worn-out wrenches
or you could have one atomic wrench.</i>

798
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,402
<i>Throw the old ones out.
This covers--</i>

799
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:18,739
<i>"champion for the ages" chick Hicks here.
Coming to you live from...</i>

800
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,116
<i>Chick Hicks studios,
where I'm joined once again by...</i>

801
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:23,243
<i>Next-gen racing expert, Natalie certain.</i>

802
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,956
<i>Thanks, chick. Piston cup champion
Jackson storm set a new record...</i>

803
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:30,751
<i>Today when he pulled off
the fastest lap ever recorded.</i>

804
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:34,671
<i>An unprecedented 213 miles an hour.</i>

805
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,382
<i>So what do you think, certain?</i>

806
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:40,052
Stormy boy gonna start the season
with another win?

807
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:43,722
Highly likely, chick. Based on his
recent run times and forecasted...

808
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:46,391
Track temperatures on race day,
storm's chances of winning...

809
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:48,894
-Are 95.2%.
- That low, huh?

810
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,347
And in case you missed it, talk of the
track tonight is lightning McQueen...

811
00:54:54,514 --> 00:54:59,060
Finding yet another way to embarrass
himself at a demolition derby.

812
00:55:00,145 --> 00:55:02,606
Almost makes me feel sorry for the guy.
Not really.

813
00:55:03,273 --> 00:55:04,524
Here's what his new sponsor had to say.

814
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:07,277
Everyone, relax. The 95's gonna race.

815
00:55:07,444 --> 00:55:11,156
Lightning's just taking a somewhat
unconventional approach to this race.

816
00:55:11,323 --> 00:55:12,699
It's one of the things
his fans love about him.

817
00:55:13,985 --> 00:55:17,279
<i>Yeah, right! Talk about humiliating.
If I were old ka-chow...</i>

818
00:55:17,446 --> 00:55:19,407
<i>I wouldn't even bother to show up
in Florida.</i>

819
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:21,909
<i>That could be for the best, chick.
Even if he does race...</i>

820
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:26,706
<i>McQueen's probability of winning is 1.2%.</i>

821
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:29,709
<i>Numbers never lie.</i>

822
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,503
<i>I'm willing to predict tonight
that lightning McQueen's racing...</i>

823
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,550
<i>Career will be over within the week.
It might even be over now.</i>

824
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:39,593
<i>I mean, I knew his career
was stuck in the mud--</i>

825
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:46,517
<i>first you find a can from a rusty Van
bump-bump</i>

826
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:49,353
<i>quicker than a dart, make it into art
bump-bump</i>

827
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,105
<i>that's the way it's done
it's a lot of fun</i>

828
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:52,106
<i>bump-bump</i>

829
00:55:52,273 --> 00:55:54,608
<i>liftin' my funk
makin' sculpture outta junk</i>

830
00:55:56,694 --> 00:55:59,905
what's that? There we go!
Somebody's interrupting genius!

831
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:04,782
- Well, hey, there, buddy!
- Mater!

832
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:08,327
You know, I was just thinking of you
and here you are lookin' right at me!

833
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:12,290
<i>You see me okay? Hang on a second
there. Hold on. Let me see here.</i>

834
00:56:13,624 --> 00:56:14,417
<i>That better?</i>

835
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:20,047
Looking you straight in the eye there,
pal. Hey, sorry about calling so late.

836
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,795
Shoot, not for me it's not.
I'm always burning that midnight oil.

837
00:56:23,961 --> 00:56:26,088
So get me caught up on everything.

838
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:29,675
Well, actually kind of hoping I might
hear what's going on back home.

839
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:34,430
Not much. If you don't count sarge
and Fillmore tryin' to run the tire shop.

840
00:56:34,597 --> 00:56:37,934
But tell Luigi not to worry,
sarge is gonna track down...

841
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,520
Every last tire
that Fillmore done gived away.

842
00:56:41,312 --> 00:56:43,272
<i>Other than that, everything's good.</i>

843
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:45,024
- How's Sally?
- She's fine.

844
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:47,860
<i>Keeping busy at the cone.
She misses you.</i>

845
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:50,738
<i>Well, shoot!
We all do when you're on the road.</i>

846
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:56,244
Yeah. You know,
I've been kind of thinking about that.

847
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,705
You know, what we should do
when I'm not on the road anymore.

848
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:01,791
<i>What do you mean not on the road?</i>

849
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:07,588
Well, you know.
Mater, I can't do this forever.

850
00:57:10,716 --> 00:57:13,553
I'm just not getting anywhere
with the training.

851
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:15,930
If anything,
I've gotten slower not faster.

852
00:57:16,597 --> 00:57:19,809
<i>Shoot, buddy, it'll work out.
Just tell me what the problem is...</i>

853
00:57:19,976 --> 00:57:22,186
<i>And I'll stay right here with you
until we fix it.</i>

854
00:57:22,812 --> 00:57:27,733
That's just it, mater. I don't know.
And I feel like I'm all out of ideas.

855
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:32,864
<i>All right, let me think.
You know what I'd do?</i>

856
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,576
<i>- What?
- I don't know.</i>

857
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:40,162
<i>I got nothin'. I guess I ain't doc
when it comes to that.</i>

858
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:44,500
I would give anything
to talk to him right now.

859
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,295
<i>Yep, there was nobody smarter
than old doc.</i>

860
00:57:47,461 --> 00:57:49,171
<i>Well, except for maybe
whoever taught him.</i>

861
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,632
Yeah. Wait. What?

862
00:57:52,216 --> 00:57:55,386
<i>Everybody was taught by somebody,
right? Take my cousin Doyle.</i>

863
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:58,097
<i>He taught me how to sing and whistle
at the same time.</i>

864
00:57:58,264 --> 00:57:59,682
<i>He was very musical that way.</i>

865
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:02,852
Smokey. Mater, you're brilliant.

866
00:58:03,102 --> 00:58:06,397
<i>Well...
It's all about the shape of your teeth.</i>

867
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:07,899
I got to go to thomasville.

868
00:58:08,065 --> 00:58:11,861
Oh, well, good. You know me, buddy,
I'm always happy to help.

869
00:58:12,028 --> 00:58:15,781
Think I am better at that than most folks.
You know, talkin' and stuff.

870
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:32,548
Hey, Cruz.

871
00:58:33,215 --> 00:58:34,967
You won't talk me out of this,
Mr. McQueen.

872
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:37,595
I'm going back. I resign as your trainer.

873
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:42,141
All right. I accept your resignation. Bye.

874
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:44,727
Okay.

875
00:58:45,561 --> 00:58:49,315
But since you cleared your calendar,
why don't you come with us?

876
00:58:49,482 --> 00:58:51,525
I'm looking for someone named smokey.

877
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:55,029
Hoping he can help me.
Maybe he can help you too.

878
00:58:55,696 --> 00:58:56,530
Nah.

879
00:58:56,697 --> 00:58:59,867
Come on. I fixed it.

880
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:03,412
No. Thanks anyway. But I'm done.

881
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:08,125
Okay. But maybe this will change
your mind. Hit it.

882
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:12,380
First I'm going to loosen up
these ancient joints--

883
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:15,633
- no, please don't.
-L'm sorry. I'm sorry.

884
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,097
I'm sorry that I yelled. It wasn't
your fault that I almost got killed.

885
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,433
But now you're leaving
and you won't get on the ramp.

886
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,143
- All right, I'll go.
- You won't get on the ramp.

887
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:26,894
All right, I'll go! Just stop!

888
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:34,276
How do you know smokey's going to be here?

889
00:59:34,443 --> 00:59:35,778
I don't.

890
00:59:37,363 --> 00:59:39,031
Do you know if he's even alive?

891
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:40,700
Nope.

892
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:42,410
Okay.

893
00:59:43,744 --> 00:59:46,497
So tell me this: How do you know
if it's smokey? Ls there such--

894
00:59:46,664 --> 00:59:50,334
wait. Mack, pull over!
Back it up! Back it up.

895
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,270
Good to see you, doc.

896
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,523
Hey, isn't that your old crew chief?

897
01:00:13,357 --> 01:00:18,487
Hey, Cruz? You want to check out the
home track of the greatest racer ever?

898
01:00:21,073 --> 01:00:26,036
Aren't we supposed to be looking
for smokey? That's right, he's dead.

899
01:00:26,203 --> 01:00:27,997
We don't know that.

900
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:38,090
Are you sure you have time for this?

901
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:41,635
For this, I do.

902
01:01:02,155 --> 01:01:03,907
If this track could talk.

903
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:10,914
Cruz, what do you say? Let's take a lap.

904
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,126
Yeah!

905
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:38,608
Yes! You nailed it!

906
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:41,528
Way easier without the school bus of death
trying to kill us!

907
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:42,988
Yeah, no kidding!

908
01:01:59,835 --> 01:02:02,254
Was starting to think
i might never meet you.

909
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:04,131
Smokey?

910
01:02:08,177 --> 01:02:09,971
He is alive.

911
01:02:10,638 --> 01:02:14,934
I know why you're here. You're thirsty.

912
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:23,234
I'll tell you what, these folks are gonna
get a kick out of meeting hud's boy.

913
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:27,989
Who's hud? Doc Hudson! Right.

914
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:34,704
Hey! Act civilized. We got company.

915
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:37,790
Hey, les.
How's that back axle treating you?

916
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:39,458
Hey, sugar, welcome to thomasville.

917
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:43,921
- Would you look at that?
- What?

918
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:46,340
Three of the biggest racing legends ever!

919
01:02:46,757 --> 01:02:49,719
Junior "midnight" moon.
River Scott. Louise--

920
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:52,221
Louise "barnstormer" Nash?
She had 38 wins!

921
01:02:52,722 --> 01:02:55,891
Well, as I live and breathe.
If it ain't lightning McQueen.

922
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,102
Ms. Nash, it's a pleasure to meet you--

923
01:02:58,352 --> 01:02:59,395
you've had a tough year, haven't you?

924
01:03:00,771 --> 01:03:03,566
Shouldn't you be running practice laps
in Florida by now?

925
01:03:03,983 --> 01:03:06,318
- Yeah, sure, but--
- they're here to steal our secrets.

926
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:08,112
Looking for your lost mojo?

927
01:03:09,488 --> 01:03:11,073
You don't mince words around here, do you?

928
01:03:12,533 --> 01:03:14,326
Truth is always quicker, kid.

929
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:24,837
<i>But all he kept talking about was
glory days</i>

930
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,216
<i>they'll pass you by
glory days</i>

931
01:03:29,383 --> 01:03:33,054
<i>in the wink of a young girl's eye
glory days</i>

932
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,973
<i>glory days</i>

933
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,600
guido, she's an angel.

934
01:03:38,934 --> 01:03:43,981
Lou won't admit this,
but she used to have serious eyes for hud.

935
01:03:44,732 --> 01:03:45,649
Really?

936
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:47,526
Even if I did, it wouldn't have mattered.

937
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:50,529
Hud didn't like fast women.
And that left me out.

938
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:54,241
Old Lou wasn't just fast,
she was fearless.

939
01:03:54,492 --> 01:03:57,578
The second I saw my first race,
i just knew I had to get in there.

940
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:02,166
Of course, the fellas in charge didn't
like a lady racer showin' them up.

941
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,876
So they wouldn't let me have a number.

942
01:04:04,126 --> 01:04:05,294
What did you do?

943
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:06,796
I stole one!

944
01:04:07,046 --> 01:04:07,880
What?

945
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:11,258
Life's too short to take no for an answer.
Right, river?

946
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:14,303
If we had waited for an invitation,
we might've never raced.

947
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:16,889
And once we got on the track,
we didn't want to leave.

948
01:04:17,098 --> 01:04:18,682
I think that's how doc felt too.

949
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:22,853
You should've seen him when
he first came to town. Shiny blue paint.

950
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,315
Notjust the Hudson hornet.
He was already calling himself...

951
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:28,776
The fabulous Hudson hornet.

952
01:04:30,194 --> 01:04:32,071
Did we ever ride him on that.

953
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:33,155
Not for long.

954
01:04:33,322 --> 01:04:36,200
Hud was the fastest racer
this side of the Mississippi.

955
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:37,827
Until he wasn't.

956
01:04:38,494 --> 01:04:39,328
What?

957
01:04:40,496 --> 01:04:42,832
Everything changed
when the rookie showed up.

958
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:52,424
<i>Took hud all of no time
to work his way through the best racers...</i>

959
01:04:52,508 --> 01:04:54,093
<i>In both carolinas.</i>

960
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:58,848
<i>Past river. Past Lou. Even junior.</i>

961
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,060
<i>But there was still the rookie
to deal with.</i>

962
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,940
<i>Tried slamming him into the wall.</i>

963
01:05:09,859 --> 01:05:13,863
<i>But hud never touched any wall,
unless he wanted to.</i>

964
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:27,918
That rookie never saw anything
like that before.

965
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:30,296
- Doc did that?
- Are you kidding?

966
01:05:30,546 --> 01:05:33,632
Couldn't wipe the smile off his face
for a week after that.

967
01:05:35,634 --> 01:05:37,720
Iwish I could've seen him like that.

968
01:05:38,888 --> 01:05:41,765
- Like what?
- So happy.

969
01:05:48,939 --> 01:05:51,901
You didn't come all this way
for a quart of oil, did you?

970
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:55,112
I need your help, smokey.

971
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:58,282
Yeah? What kind of help?

972
01:05:59,617 --> 01:06:04,830
That's just it, I'm not sure.
All I know is if I lose in Florida...

973
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:10,085
It's over for me.
What happened to doc will happen to me.

974
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,922
What did happen to him?

975
01:06:14,256 --> 01:06:18,302
You know,
racing was the best part of his life.

976
01:06:18,469 --> 01:06:20,179
And when it ended, he--

977
01:06:21,513 --> 01:06:23,974
well, we both know
he was never the same after that.

978
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:27,603
Is that what you think?

979
01:06:29,605 --> 01:06:32,274
Come on. I want to show you something.

980
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,199
You got the first part right.

981
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:45,287
The crash broke hud's body
and the "no more racing" broke his heart.

982
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:49,375
He cut himself off.
Disappeared to radiator Springs.

983
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:52,628
Son of a gun didn't talk to me
for 50 years.

984
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:57,049
But then one day,
the letters started coming in.

985
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:12,305
And every last one of them
was about you.

986
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:20,480
Yeah, hud loved racing.
But coaching you?

987
01:07:21,814 --> 01:07:24,317
I had never seen the old grump so happy.

988
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:31,324
Racing wasn't the best part of hud's life.

989
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:34,202
You were.

990
01:07:38,456 --> 01:07:40,041
You ready to blow out
a little carbon there, boy?

991
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,000
Yes, I am!

992
01:07:44,337 --> 01:07:47,006
You give it too much throttle,
you're in the tulips.

993
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:51,052
Hey, lightning.
You might want to take notes on this one.

994
01:08:03,684 --> 01:08:05,686
<i>You got a lot of stuff, kid.</i>

995
01:08:21,785 --> 01:08:25,873
Hud saw something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.

996
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:29,585
Are you ready to go find it?

997
01:08:30,544 --> 01:08:31,920
Yes, sir.

998
01:08:41,134 --> 01:08:42,719
All right, all right. Bring it back.

999
01:08:45,597 --> 01:08:48,725
Lesson one:
You're old. Accept it.

1000
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:51,394
- I told him that.
- He's probably losing his hearing.

1001
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:54,147
- He said you're old and losing--
- I heard him.

1002
01:08:54,314 --> 01:08:58,151
You'll never be as fast as storm,
but you can be smarter than him.

1003
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,653
Okay, what do I do?

1004
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,114
They said you were in a demolition derby.

1005
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:04,824
Yeah, it was terrible and I almost--

1006
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,410
are you sure?
Because there's not a scratch on you.

1007
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:13,406
Funny what a racer can do
when he's not over-thinking things.

1008
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:18,995
<i>Shannon spokes here at Florida
international, where Jackson storm...</i>

1009
01:09:19,162 --> 01:09:22,248
<i>Clocked 214 miles per hour today.</i>

1010
01:09:27,161 --> 01:09:30,247
You want to beat storm,
you need someone to stand in for him.

1011
01:09:30,414 --> 01:09:31,915
Like a sparring partner.

1012
01:09:32,082 --> 01:09:35,919
I'm not so sure.
Not a racer. Just a trainer!

1013
01:09:36,086 --> 01:09:37,004
Go ahead and gun it.

1014
01:09:42,426 --> 01:09:43,469
Yeah!

1015
01:09:43,677 --> 01:09:46,013
With no muffler you even sound like storm.

1016
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:48,932
You're going down, McQueen!

1017
01:09:49,099 --> 01:09:52,269
Get that arthritis-riddled keister onto
the track so I can put you into...

1018
01:09:52,436 --> 01:09:54,271
The old folks' home against your will!

1019
01:09:55,939 --> 01:09:56,815
How was that?

1020
01:09:57,608 --> 01:09:59,151
- That'll work.
- Worked for me.

1021
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:00,861
- L'm good.
- Yep. That'll do.

1022
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:01,695
Did you hear what she said?

1023
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:06,992
You didn't show up in Florida for
qualifying so you'll be starting last.

1024
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:09,411
I'll give you three laps to catch her.

1025
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:12,206
Go through
the entire field in three laps?

1026
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:13,957
You want to beat storm or not?

1027
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:17,669
- Yes! Of course I do.
- Well, then, go!

1028
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:20,464
Come on, kid.

1029
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,345
All right.
Looks like we got some work to do.

1030
01:10:35,012 --> 01:10:38,349
Look alive.
The reflexes are the first thing to go.

1031
01:10:44,397 --> 01:10:45,648
Why are we in a field?

1032
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:48,151
Sneak through that window!

1033
01:10:48,234 --> 01:10:49,902
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

1034
01:10:50,027 --> 01:10:50,736
Go!

1035
01:11:00,198 --> 01:11:02,492
Not cool, man. Not cool!

1036
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:07,998
Let's run it back.

1037
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:12,335
Do you even want to be out here?

1038
01:11:15,213 --> 01:11:18,174
Only two days left, kid.
You got to work harder.

1039
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:23,885
Wait, wait, who was that?

1040
01:11:24,052 --> 01:11:26,846
I put McQueen in there.
Give you some real competition.

1041
01:11:30,684 --> 01:11:34,187
Hud was a master of letting the other cars
do the work for him.

1042
01:11:34,354 --> 01:11:36,940
He used to say
cling to 'em like you was two June bugs...

1043
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:38,358
On a summer night.

1044
01:11:38,525 --> 01:11:39,776
He stole that from me.

1045
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:42,696
Drafting? I've never had to do that.

1046
01:11:42,862 --> 01:11:46,866
Yeah, that's when you were fast.
Now you're slow.

1047
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:48,535
- And old.
- And rickety.

1048
01:11:48,702 --> 01:11:50,412
- And dilapidated.
- Okay! Okay, I get it.

1049
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:52,872
The new you
has to look for opportunities...

1050
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:54,708
You never knew were there.

1051
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:59,045
Sneak through the window!

1052
01:12:01,589 --> 01:12:03,883
- Sneak through the window.
- What?

1053
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:06,303
When a window opens, take it!

1054
01:12:15,727 --> 01:12:16,478
Yes.

1055
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:20,148
- I made it!
- All right!

1056
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:23,068
Let's go! Let's move!

1057
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:25,362
Reflexes!

1058
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:28,907
All right, guido, turn up the heat.

1059
01:12:29,115 --> 01:12:30,075
Okay.

1060
01:12:36,997 --> 01:12:39,500
All right, look who finally showed up.

1061
01:12:42,753 --> 01:12:44,839
This is where we cut our racing teeth.

1062
01:12:45,089 --> 01:12:46,465
In the woods?

1063
01:12:46,632 --> 01:12:50,761
Let's just say
the moon was always shining on us.

1064
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:55,474
If the moon didn't shine,
we didn't have to-- never mind.

1065
01:12:55,641 --> 01:12:57,435
We ran moonshine, dummy!

1066
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:01,772
By the way, no lights. Instinct only.

1067
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:04,942
Yeah!

1068
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,448
Yeah!

1069
01:13:22,626 --> 01:13:23,794
Yeah!

1070
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:37,886
All right!

1071
01:13:50,316 --> 01:13:53,152
McQueen's still not here? Didn't he
pull this when he was a rookie?

1072
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:55,195
At least that's what
my grandfather told me.

1073
01:13:55,696 --> 01:13:57,823
All right, we got time for one last race.

1074
01:13:58,824 --> 01:14:01,493
Hurry this along, boss,
we got to get you to Florida.

1075
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,786
Go!

1076
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:10,669
Maybe it's best that he doesn't show up,
after how last season ended.

1077
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:16,258
Let me put it this way.

1078
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:19,553
I'm not losing any sleep
wondering where lightning McQueen is.

1079
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:26,343
Come on, boy. Come on!

1080
01:14:34,434 --> 01:14:37,771
All right, McQueen. There you go, boy!
There you go.

1081
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:53,620
<i>McQueen is fading.
McQueen is fading. Fading fast.</i>

1082
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:00,877
Yes!

1083
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:06,383
Did you see that? That was--

1084
01:15:14,766 --> 01:15:16,726
sorry. I didn't mean to--

1085
01:15:20,563 --> 01:15:24,651
hey, boss, it's time to hit the road.

1086
01:15:26,236 --> 01:15:27,904
Yeah.

1087
01:15:30,824 --> 01:15:33,743
I want to thank everyone for the training.

1088
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:37,747
We better get going to Florida.

1089
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,342
<i>Welcome to racing's greatest day!</i>

1090
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:53,429
<i>We're beach-side at
the Florida international speedway...</i>

1091
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:57,808
<i>To kick off a new season of
piston cup racing. It's the Florida 500.</i>

1092
01:15:57,975 --> 01:16:01,437
<i>Forty-three cars and a quarter million
fans await today's intense contest of...</i>

1093
01:16:01,604 --> 01:16:03,606
<i>Strategy, skill, but most of all, speed.</i>

1094
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:05,941
<i>This crowd is in
for one great day of racing.</i>

1095
01:16:06,275 --> 01:16:09,111
<i>I 'm Bob cutlass, joined as always
by my broadcasting partner. ..</i>

1096
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:12,982
Darrell cartrip
and stat sensation Natalie certain.

1097
01:16:13,149 --> 01:16:15,777
I've never seen the numbers line up
for storm like they do today, Bob.

1098
01:16:15,944 --> 01:16:19,823
Storm should be 96.8% unstoppable.

1099
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:21,241
<i>Well, don't overlook lightning McQueen.</i>

1100
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:24,035
Whipplefilter! Yeah-hoo!

1101
01:16:24,285 --> 01:16:27,455
<i>We've heard stories of the unusual way
McQueen trained to get here.</i>

1102
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:30,542
<i>Now the question is did it work?</i>

1103
01:16:39,006 --> 01:16:44,553
Speed. I am... speed?

1104
01:16:49,725 --> 01:16:53,479
Hey, boss, they're calling the racers
to the track.

1105
01:16:56,732 --> 01:16:58,901
Jeff gorvette,
how does today's talent stack up?

1106
01:16:59,067 --> 01:17:01,487
I think we're in for a treat today.
These racers are--

1107
01:17:01,653 --> 01:17:04,323
hey, McQueen, win one for us old guys.

1108
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,158
Will do, Jeff.

1109
01:17:06,325 --> 01:17:08,202
- Hey, there, buddy!
- Hey, guys.

1110
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:11,371
- Stickers.
- Hey, sal.

1111
01:17:12,331 --> 01:17:15,000
- You okay?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

1112
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:20,172
Listen, you're gonna do great today.
And no matter what happens...

1113
01:17:20,339 --> 01:17:23,217
I'm going to move onto the next rookie
and forget I ever knew you.

1114
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:26,345
I'm glad you're here.

1115
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:31,225
Nice costume.
Come here, let's get a picture.

1116
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:33,519
It's so great to meet my number-one fan.

1117
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:35,312
What a jerk.

1118
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:38,357
- She's not a fan, storm.
- Hey there, champ.

1119
01:17:38,524 --> 01:17:40,901
I heard you're selling mudflaps
after today.

1120
01:17:41,068 --> 01:17:44,238
Is that true? Hey, you put me down
for the first case, okay?

1121
01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:59,545
Lightning! Lightning McQueen!

1122
01:18:00,587 --> 01:18:03,590
<i>- Hey, lightning!
- Hey, Mr. Sterling.</i>

1123
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:05,801
<i>To the future, eh, champ?</i>

1124
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:08,387
Yeah. To the future.

1125
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:12,641
<i>Hey, just focus on
what you're here to do, kid.</i>

1126
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:14,434
Thanks, smokey.

1127
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:16,770
<i>Now, go make hud proud.</i>

1128
01:18:16,937 --> 01:18:18,146
You got it.

1129
01:18:18,564 --> 01:18:20,232
<i>Boogity, boogity, boogity,
let's go racing!</i>

1130
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:32,735
<i>McQueen is making steady progress
in the early parts of this race.</i>

1131
01:18:33,277 --> 01:18:35,237
<i>Well, it won't be enough
to catch storm.</i>

1132
01:18:35,404 --> 01:18:36,405
<i>Considering he started dead last...</i>

1133
01:18:36,906 --> 01:18:38,741
<i>I don't think
he's doing half-bad out there.</i>

1134
01:18:47,572 --> 01:18:51,576
Not too shabby! You keep this up,
you'll finish in the top 10!

1135
01:18:51,743 --> 01:18:54,997
Top 10's not gonna cut it, smokey.
I got to go all the way.

1136
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:57,749
So dig in! Remember your training.

1137
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,793
Find storm and chase him down!

1138
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,712
Tell him he has three laps to catch me!

1139
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,256
Cruz says you've got
three laps to catch her.

1140
01:19:04,423 --> 01:19:06,133
Yeah, okay! Tell her, thanks.

1141
01:19:12,757 --> 01:19:16,219
- Cruz, what are you doing here?
- Mr. Sterling, I was just--

1142
01:19:16,386 --> 01:19:17,929
I'd like you to head back
to the training center right away.

1143
01:19:18,471 --> 01:19:19,472
But why?

1144
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:21,933
I need you to get Kurt up to speed
for the race next weekend.

1145
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,937
Wait, not Kurt. He's the bug guy, right?
The other one-- Ronald. Yes!

1146
01:19:26,221 --> 01:19:27,681
But I want to stay and watch.

1147
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:29,474
That's not gonna happen, Cruz.

1148
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:30,767
<i>Now go.</i>

1149
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,894
But Mr. McQueen still has a chance--

1150
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:34,396
just go do your job!

1151
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:35,939
Yes, sir.

1152
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:39,734
And take off that spoiler and those
racing tires. You look ridiculous!

1153
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:43,530
You are a trainer, remember?
Not a racer!

1154
01:19:45,282 --> 01:19:48,952
If you were a racer, you'd know what
I'm talking about but you're not!

1155
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:50,287
So you don't!

1156
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,710
<i>No. She's not a racer. She's a trainer.</i>

1157
01:20:05,336 --> 01:20:11,092
<i>I've wanted to become a racer forever!
Because of you!</i>

1158
01:20:12,802 --> 01:20:16,389
It was my one shot and I didn't take it.

1159
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:20,310
<i>It was my one shot and I didn't take it.</i>

1160
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,733
<i>Wreck in two. Wreck in turn two.
Go low. Go low.</i>

1161
01:20:40,914 --> 01:20:42,123
Kid, you okay?

1162
01:20:42,332 --> 01:20:43,792
Smokey, I need Cruz!

1163
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:47,837
<i>- Never mind that now.
- No! I need her back here. Now!</i>

1164
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,918
<i>The yellow flag still out, folks.</i>

1165
01:20:50,085 --> 01:20:52,170
<i>Wrecked cars everywhere.
We're still trying to figure--</i>

1166
01:20:52,337 --> 01:20:54,506
<i>Hamilton here.
Call from Chester whipplefilter.</i>

1167
01:20:54,673 --> 01:20:57,092
Chester-- Mr. McQueen?

1168
01:20:57,425 --> 01:21:00,428
The green light's on, pit road is open,
and everybody's coming in.

1169
01:21:01,513 --> 01:21:04,808
Get ready, guys. Luigi, guido, tires!
Fillmore, fuel!

1170
01:21:04,974 --> 01:21:06,768
Okay, I'm here. What's going on?

1171
01:21:07,852 --> 01:21:09,938
No! Not me! Her.

1172
01:21:11,106 --> 01:21:11,773
What?

1173
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,692
- What is she doing back here?
- Come on, guys! Get her set up!

1174
01:21:13,858 --> 01:21:16,194
- Okay! Hot tires!
- Wait! What's happening?

1175
01:21:16,444 --> 01:21:17,987
<i>Hey, Ramona you got your pants'?</i>

1176
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:21,533
- You know I do!
- Guys! What are you doing?

1177
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:24,536
Man, I don't understand it!
McQueen's just sitting there.

1178
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:25,745
Something's got to be wrong.

1179
01:21:25,995 --> 01:21:26,830
Mr. McQueen?

1180
01:21:27,038 --> 01:21:28,873
Today's the day, Cruz.
You're getting your shot.

1181
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:29,666
What?

1182
01:21:29,874 --> 01:21:32,293
I started this race
and you're gonna finish it.

1183
01:21:32,794 --> 01:21:36,589
What? She'll damage the brand!
She's just a trainer!

1184
01:21:36,798 --> 01:21:39,718
No, she's a racer.
Just took me awhile to see it.

1185
01:21:40,135 --> 01:21:41,052
That can't be legal!

1186
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,388
The rules only say
the number has to be out there.

1187
01:21:43,555 --> 01:21:45,014
Doesn't say who has to wear it.

1188
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:49,310
- No! You can't do that--
- did I tell you I love your mudflaps?

1189
01:21:49,519 --> 01:21:50,645
Out of my way, bumpkin!

1190
01:21:50,937 --> 01:21:54,774
Got my fishing flaps, got my church
flaps, my going out and eating flaps.

1191
01:21:56,985 --> 01:21:59,529
Come on, guys!
We got to get her out there! Let's go!

1192
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:00,905
- Tires, check!
- Fuel, check!

1193
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,698
Ramone?

1194
01:22:01,948 --> 01:22:04,534
Best I could do in the time frame, boss.

1195
01:22:05,034 --> 01:22:07,954
Yeah. That'll work.

1196
01:22:08,246 --> 01:22:09,622
Why are you doing this?

1197
01:22:09,789 --> 01:22:12,459
You said it yourself,
this might be your last chance.

1198
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:16,921
Which makes it my last chance
to give you your first chance, Cruz.

1199
01:22:17,922 --> 01:22:19,674
And this time I want you to take it.

1200
01:22:21,801 --> 01:22:23,845
She's got to beat that pace car out.

1201
01:22:25,555 --> 01:22:27,599
- No! You can't do that!
- Now or never.

1202
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:29,851
What do you say?

1203
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:34,731
Hey! 35-mile-per-hour pit speed!

1204
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:35,982
I knew that!

1205
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:47,577
McQueen's team has entered
a different car sporting the 95.

1206
01:22:47,744 --> 01:22:48,953
I don't believe what I'm seeing!

1207
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,413
You're watching this, right?

1208
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:54,501
What, the girl in the costume?
You're kidding me. He put her in the race?

1209
01:23:04,918 --> 01:23:07,378
The green flag is out
and we're back to racing.

1210
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:13,343
Cruz? What are you doing?

1211
01:23:13,593 --> 01:23:15,637
<i>Come on. Pick it up!
You got to go faster.</i>

1212
01:23:15,929 --> 01:23:20,517
Call her Frances beltline and tell her
the school bus of death is after her.

1213
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,519
- What? No.
- Trust me.

1214
01:23:24,687 --> 01:23:27,982
Frances beltline,
the school bus of death is after you.

1215
01:23:29,275 --> 01:23:32,111
What? Right.

1216
01:23:32,987 --> 01:23:34,739
Okay, that was different.

1217
01:23:36,407 --> 01:23:39,619
Cruz, you're looking too tight now.
Come on. Loosen up.

1218
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:42,163
- Tell her she's a fluffy cloud.
- What? No.

1219
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:43,204
Smokey, tell her.

1220
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:48,752
Cruz, you are a fluffy cloud.

1221
01:23:49,919 --> 01:23:54,299
Right. Too tight.
I'm a fluffy cloud. I'm a fluffy cloud.

1222
01:23:58,344 --> 01:24:01,389
Anticipate your turns.
Cruz! Get your head in the race.

1223
01:24:02,015 --> 01:24:06,561
Tell her she's on a beach and all the
little crabbies have gone night-night.

1224
01:24:08,104 --> 01:24:10,440
No! I ain't saying that. You tell her.

1225
01:24:12,442 --> 01:24:15,278
<i>All right, Cruz. The beach.
I need you to think of the beach.</i>

1226
01:24:15,445 --> 01:24:17,906
<i>- Mr. McQueen?
- Yeah. It's me. Remember the beach.</i>

1227
01:24:18,573 --> 01:24:20,784
Pick a line, stick to it. Got it.

1228
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,163
All right. Not too bad.

1229
01:24:25,622 --> 01:24:27,248
This is nothing like the simulator.

1230
01:24:27,832 --> 01:24:31,044
You got every tool you need.
Now remember thomasville.

1231
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:33,254
- Thomasville?
- Yeah. Sneak through the window.

1232
01:24:33,546 --> 01:24:35,173
Now that I understand.

1233
01:24:35,423 --> 01:24:36,883
Sneak through the window.

1234
01:24:54,692 --> 01:24:59,155
We're just learning that the racer
replacing McQueen is Cruz Ramirez.

1235
01:24:59,322 --> 01:25:00,907
This is her very first race!

1236
01:25:01,074 --> 01:25:04,702
Actually, Darrell, it says here
she does have one win under her belt.

1237
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:06,996
At a place called thunder hollow?

1238
01:25:07,497 --> 01:25:10,208
Thunder hollow! She said thunder hollow!

1239
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,379
Try moving half a Lane. Half a Lane.

1240
01:25:14,587 --> 01:25:16,297
<i>- Got it.
- All right, watch that lap car.</i>

1241
01:25:16,422 --> 01:25:20,468
<i>He's gonna go high.
Go low! Go low! Nice job.</i>

1242
01:25:20,718 --> 01:25:22,178
You are smoking these guys.

1243
01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:25,932
<i>Now watch the tire marbles along
turn three. Keep your tires clean.</i>

1244
01:25:26,015 --> 01:25:27,684
- Okay.
- Bump coming up on the inside.

1245
01:25:27,767 --> 01:25:29,144
Careful you don't go airborne.

1246
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:30,478
<i>- Now'?
- Yes. Now!</i>

1247
01:25:30,645 --> 01:25:33,815
<i>Watch out by the wall, it's a little slick
there. Watch it, watch it, watch it.</i>

1248
01:25:35,859 --> 01:25:38,945
You have hit a wall. You have hit a wall.

1249
01:25:39,112 --> 01:25:41,406
Ha-ha. Just being aggressive.

1250
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,829
<i>Okay, I want you to pit. Watch your rpm.</i>

1251
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:50,415
Get out of the gas.
On the brake. On the brake.

1252
01:25:50,582 --> 01:25:52,709
- Too fast!
- We're back here.

1253
01:25:52,876 --> 01:25:53,710
Sorry.

1254
01:25:54,586 --> 01:25:57,172
All right. Pick 'em off one at a time.
Go, go, go!

1255
01:25:59,883 --> 01:26:01,843
<i>That's it. Nice and straight.</i>

1256
01:26:04,888 --> 01:26:07,640
Go, go, go, go! Smokey, you watching?

1257
01:26:12,604 --> 01:26:15,273
Just wanted to let you know
Ramirez is moving up toward you.

1258
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:17,150
Why should I care?

1259
01:26:17,317 --> 01:26:18,735
<i>Because now she's in the top 10!</i>

1260
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:24,490
Okay. Now you're coming up on the leaders.

1261
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:34,459
<i>- Ramirez up to fourth.
- In fourth?</i>

1262
01:26:38,087 --> 01:26:38,922
Get 'er done!

1263
01:26:41,799 --> 01:26:43,676
<i>Ramirez is in third.</i>

1264
01:26:51,559 --> 01:26:53,186
What are you doing, storm?

1265
01:26:54,187 --> 01:26:58,149
Hey! Costume girl. You know,
at first I thought you were out here...

1266
01:26:58,233 --> 01:26:59,734
Because your GPS was broken.

1267
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:01,110
Don't listen to him, Cruz!

1268
01:27:01,194 --> 01:27:02,237
You look good!

1269
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,696
It's important to look the part.

1270
01:27:03,863 --> 01:27:06,991
You can't have everyone thinking
that you don't deserve to be here.

1271
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:08,201
He's trying to get in your head!

1272
01:27:08,701 --> 01:27:10,703
They don't need to know
what you and I already do.

1273
01:27:11,454 --> 01:27:16,793
That you can play dress-up all you want,
but you'll never be one of us.

1274
01:27:24,342 --> 01:27:25,969
Cruz, did you see what happened there?

1275
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:28,638
Yeah. He's in my head.

1276
01:27:28,888 --> 01:27:33,518
No! Listen to me. You got into his head.
Don't you understand?

1277
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:37,313
He would never have done that
if you didn't scare him.

1278
01:27:37,397 --> 01:27:38,314
What?

1279
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:41,359
<i>He sees something in you
that you don't even see in yourself.</i>

1280
01:27:42,026 --> 01:27:45,863
You made me believe it,
now you got to believe it too.

1281
01:27:47,282 --> 01:27:49,367
<i>You are a racer.</i>

1282
01:27:50,201 --> 01:27:51,494
Use that.

1283
01:28:02,005 --> 01:28:05,425
<i>- And how far back is she now?
- Look behind you.</i>

1284
01:28:05,591 --> 01:28:06,259
What?

1285
01:28:06,342 --> 01:28:08,094
- Good evening, storm!
- Wait, how did you--

1286
01:28:08,261 --> 01:28:09,762
just back here drafting on your butt.

1287
01:28:09,929 --> 01:28:11,180
Nothing to be concerned about.

1288
01:28:11,597 --> 01:28:13,933
<i>Like two June bugs on a summer night.</i>

1289
01:28:17,854 --> 01:28:18,980
Hey, Hamilton.

1290
01:28:19,147 --> 01:28:21,107
<i>- Hamilton here.
- Call out our speed.</i>

1291
01:28:21,274 --> 01:28:24,360
<i>208 miles per hour, 207 miles--</i>

1292
01:28:24,444 --> 01:28:26,529
would you stop that?
You're taking me off my line!

1293
01:28:26,738 --> 01:28:28,698
- Last lap!
- Come on, Cruz!

1294
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:35,284
My GPS is saying
i have slow traffic in my way.

1295
01:28:35,451 --> 01:28:38,287
- No, you are not winning this!
- You're angry.

1296
01:28:38,537 --> 01:28:40,247
I am not angry!

1297
01:28:40,664 --> 01:28:42,875
You know, you can use that anger
to push through.

1298
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:44,168
I said I'm not angry!

1299
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,422
I don't think so! No!

1300
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:53,677
Cruz, get out of there!

1301
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:56,514
You don't belong on this track!

1302
01:28:57,848 --> 01:29:00,142
Yes, I do!

1303
01:29:12,446 --> 01:29:15,491
<i>I don't believe it.
It's Cruz Ramirez for the win!</i>

1304
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:16,992
<i>I am speechless!</i>

1305
01:29:18,784 --> 01:29:21,454
Nice finish, Cruz! You done it!

1306
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,706
Cruz Ramirez!

1307
01:29:23,956 --> 01:29:26,042
- Yeah, there you go!
- Way to go, Cruz!

1308
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:27,752
Yes!

1309
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:36,552
Man, heck of a win!

1310
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:40,848
Yeah. Heck of a win.

1311
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:47,887
- Hey, Cruz! You were flying!
- Thanks.

1312
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:49,723
- You really had it rolling today.
- That was cool.

1313
01:29:49,889 --> 01:29:50,557
Thank you!

1314
01:29:50,724 --> 01:29:56,021
- Hey, Cruz, your blinker's on.
- It is? You got me! Very funny!

1315
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,031
Ramirez!

1316
01:30:07,365 --> 01:30:08,992
Way to go, Cruz!

1317
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:12,579
Go ahead. Give them some smoke.

1318
01:30:13,288 --> 01:30:15,665
Cruz! Cruz! Cruz!

1319
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:28,461
You'll get used to that.

1320
01:30:28,628 --> 01:30:30,713
Out of my way! Come on! Move it! Move!

1321
01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:34,467
Cruz! I knew you had something.

1322
01:30:34,634 --> 01:30:36,928
And now look at you... a winner.

1323
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:40,723
I could use you as a racer on our team.
We could make--

1324
01:30:41,223 --> 01:30:43,851
sorry, Mr. Sterling.
I would never race for you.

1325
01:30:44,518 --> 01:30:45,561
I quit.

1326
01:30:46,437 --> 01:30:48,898
- Well, then race for me!
- Tex!

1327
01:30:49,315 --> 01:30:53,069
Miss Cruz, I would be tickled pink
to have you race for team dinoco.

1328
01:30:53,235 --> 01:30:57,406
As you know, we have a long history
of great racers, except for Cal.

1329
01:30:57,573 --> 01:30:59,700
Guys, I'm still right here.

1330
01:30:59,909 --> 01:31:01,702
Team dinoco, Cruz!

1331
01:31:01,911 --> 01:31:03,204
Hire her. I don't care.

1332
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:05,081
Lightning, now that you're retired...

1333
01:31:05,247 --> 01:31:08,042
I need you first thing Monday morning
for a photo shoot.

1334
01:31:08,584 --> 01:31:12,088
- Yeah, all right, Mr. Sterling.
- Hang on now.

1335
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:17,551
What? Why is my name up there?

1336
01:31:17,843 --> 01:31:20,179
You started the race. That's how it works.

1337
01:31:20,387 --> 01:31:21,680
Wait, wait, now-- wait a minute. No!

1338
01:31:21,847 --> 01:31:25,559
Lightning wins, he decides when
he's done racing. That was the deal.

1339
01:31:25,726 --> 01:31:27,019
Hi, I'm his lawyer.

1340
01:31:27,186 --> 01:31:28,771
That was the deal.

1341
01:31:28,938 --> 01:31:30,314
You are not a nice guy.

1342
01:31:30,481 --> 01:31:34,443
Although, I got to say, you do make
a quality mudflap at an affordable price.

1343
01:31:35,069 --> 01:31:38,739
Hey, Sterling.
Why don't you and I take a drive and talk?

1344
01:31:38,906 --> 01:31:40,658
Billionaire to billionaire.

1345
01:31:40,824 --> 01:31:44,036
Cruz, over here. Just one picture.
How does it feel to beat Jackson storm?

1346
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:45,287
Take us through it, lap by lap.

1347
01:31:46,121 --> 01:31:49,375
It was great! Didn't expect this.

1348
01:31:53,414 --> 01:31:56,041
Kid's got a lot of stuff, eh, doc?

1349
01:31:58,293 --> 01:32:00,421
Well, she had a great teacher.

1350
01:32:02,005 --> 01:32:04,925
And now you get to decide
when you're done racing.

1351
01:32:05,551 --> 01:32:08,178
So what's it gonna be, stinky? Stickers.

1352
01:32:10,806 --> 01:32:15,769
I'm gonna keep racing. But before that,
i got something I want to do.

1353
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:29,074
Welcome all to historic Willy's butte
for today's great exhibition of speed!

1354
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:33,370
There she is! Cruz!
I love it. I love it. I love it.

1355
01:32:33,537 --> 01:32:34,329
Thanks, guys!

1356
01:32:34,538 --> 01:32:36,290
Nice paint, kiddo.

1357
01:32:36,457 --> 01:32:40,961
Pardon me. Big hat, coming through.
Get 'er done, 51!

1358
01:32:41,128 --> 01:32:43,672
Great number. It was McQueen's idea.

1359
01:32:43,839 --> 01:32:45,758
He felt hud would've
wanted you to have it.

1360
01:32:46,258 --> 01:32:47,676
I love it.

1361
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:49,970
It's perfect. It's very old-school.

1362
01:32:50,137 --> 01:32:52,389
Did someone just say old-school?

1363
01:32:53,432 --> 01:32:55,309
Yeah!

1364
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:58,437
Yeah! I like that.
It's bright, but I like it.

1365
01:33:00,397 --> 01:33:03,025
- Looking fabulous.
- Favoloso.

1366
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:06,195
Trying something new. I like it.

1367
01:33:07,613 --> 01:33:08,655
Subtle.

1368
01:33:08,822 --> 01:33:12,534
Figured if I'm gonna be your crew chief,
i better do it in style.

1369
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:14,661
What's Mr. Sterling gonna say?

1370
01:33:14,828 --> 01:33:18,165
I'm actually more worried about
what Tex is gonna say, considering he...

1371
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:21,293
Bought rust-eze. Thanks, Tex!

1372
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:25,714
I made that Sterling fella
a Texas-sized offer!

1373
01:33:26,215 --> 01:33:28,008
So, you ready to start training?

1374
01:33:28,175 --> 01:33:30,093
I don't know. You ready to lose again?

1375
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:32,596
Hope you've got your fluffy cloud.

1376
01:33:32,763 --> 01:33:34,014
I hope you got your drip pan.

1377
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:37,059
Got my drip pan and I've taken my nap.

1378
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:38,143
Bring it on, old man.

1379
01:33:38,227 --> 01:33:39,686
- Luigi.
- Go!

1380
01:33:41,396 --> 01:33:44,066

1391
01:34:20,428 --> 01:34:24,140

1392
01:34:26,434 --> 01:34:28,769
