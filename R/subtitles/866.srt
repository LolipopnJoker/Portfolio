1
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,411
(wind howls)

2
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,545
(screech)

3
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,627
(heavy breathing)

4
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,421
(snarling)

5
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,968
(ferocious screeching)

6
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,563
(screeching stops)

7
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,133
(screeching)

8
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,891
(screaming and howling)

9
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,882
(grunting)

10
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,761
(roaring)

11
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,231
Hey, Stevie, you okay?

12
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,235
I got... (coughing)

13
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,825
I got the wind knocked out of me.

14
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,786
Looks like a cave.

15
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,049
Stevie, what's goin' on?

16
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,639
It's a human skull!

17
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,975
- Toss it up here!
- No way! It's mine.

18
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,813
Anyway, there's bones
all over the place, man!

19
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,578
What the...

20
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,520
Stevie?

21
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,856
- Hey, Stevie!
- You okay?

22
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,696
Hey, man... let's get outta here!

23
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,844
(sirens)

24
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,114
Give me a 14-footer!

25
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,287
This is Captain Miles Cooles.
Rescue situation in progress.

26
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:21,958
Rope's in the hole.
Let's go. Two down.

27
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,717
What ya got, TC? Talk to me.

28
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,971
Do you see the boy?

29
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,933
(static on radio)

30
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,978
Come back, TC. You see the kid?

31
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,772
(static)

32
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,607
Danny, check TC's radio.

33
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,193
TC?

34
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,445
Glenn, Sal, in the hole!

35
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,689
- Get those people outta here!
- Move 'em back!

36
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,274
Move back, folks!

37
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:34,864
I sent four men down there for the boy.
Report is, his eyes had turned black.

38
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,326
Now we've lost communication with my men.

39
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,385
What about my men?

40
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,183
What about my men!

41
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,817
(truck horn)

42
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,657
What the hell is this?

43
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,063
It's Bronschweig.

44
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:53,109
Sir, the impossible scenario
that we never planned for?

45
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,111
We'd better come up with a plan.

46
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,356
We've evacuated the building.

47
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:37,070
- There's no trace of an explosive device.
- You sent the dogs through?

48
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,113
Yes, sir.

49
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,115
Send 'em through again.

50
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,161
All right, guys.

51
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,414
Let's do it again!

52
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,526
Mulder, it's me.

53
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,028
- Where are you, Scully?
- On the roof.

54
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,990
- Find anything?
- No, I haven't.

55
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,033
What's wrong?

56
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,704
I just climbed up 12 floors,
I'm hot, I'm thirsty,...

57
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,707
.. and I'm wondering what I'm doing.

58
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,709
You're looking for a bomb.

59
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,129
But the threat was made
on the Federal Building.

60
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,381
They have that covered.

61
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:45,138
When a bomb threat is called in, the rational
purpose of it is to allow us to find the bomb.

62
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,684
The rational object of terrorism
is to promote terror.

63
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:56,608
There's a model behavioural pattern for every
case where a threat has turned up a bomb.

64
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,487
And if we ignore that data, as we have done,...

65
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,283
.. the chances are great that,
if there is a bomb, we might not find it.

66
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,619
Lives could be lost.

67
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,164
Mulder?

68
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,081
Boom!

69
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,500
Jesus, Mulder!

70
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,127
Whatever happened to hunches?

71
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,295
(sighs)

72
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,423
Random acts of unpredictability.

73
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:26,095
If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen
in a universe of infinite possibilities,...

74
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:32,060
.. we may find ourselves at the mercy
of anything that cannot be categorised.

75
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,566
What are we doin' up here, Scully?
It's hotter than hell.

76
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:48,201
I know you're bored, but unconventional
thinking will only get you into trouble now.

77
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,872
- Why do you think I'm bored?
- Quit looking for what isn't there.

78
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,251
They've closed the X-Files.
We follow procedure now.

79
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:02,257
Let's make a bomb threat to Houston.
It's free-beer night at the Astrodome.

80
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,011
(tries door)

81
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,096
Now what?

82
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,722
It's locked?

83
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,934
So much for anticipating the unforeseen!

84
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,273
- I had you.
- No, you didn't.

85
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,859
- I had you big time.
- You had nothing.

86
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,694
I saw you jiggle the handle.

87
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,324
I saw your face.
There was a definite moment of panic.

88
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,537
You've never seen me panic.
When I panic, I make this face.

89
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,705
That was it.

90
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,001
- You didn't see that face.
- I saw that face. You're buying.

91
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,005
Coke? Pepsi? Saline IV?

92
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,257
Somethin' sweet.

93
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,089
- (phone rings)
- Scully.

94
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,924
I've found the bomb.

95
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,260
You're funny. Where are you, Mulder?

96
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,638
I'm in the vending room.

97
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,017
- (banging)
- Is that you pounding?

98
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,354
Yeah. Get somebody to open that door.

99
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,733
- Nice try, Mulder.
- It's in the soda machine.

100
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,152
You got 14 minutes to evacuate.

101
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,614
Come on, Mulder.

102
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,199
13.56...

103
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,410
13.54...

104
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,829
13.52...

105
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,288
13.50...

106
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,584
You see a pattern emerging here, Scully?

107
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,468
I'll get you outta there!

108
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,102
I need this building evacuated in ten minutes!

109
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:05,523
Have the fire department block off
a one-mile radius around the building!

110
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,193
- Ten minutes?
- Don't think! Just make it happen!

111
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,863
This is Security...

112
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,368
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.
I need to speak with SAC Michaud.

113
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,495
He's got the wrong building.

114
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,539
(sirens)

115
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,264
- Where is it?
- Vending machine.

116
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,349
He's locked in with it.

117
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,160
(phone)

118
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:05,792
You know that face I just showed you?
I'm making it again.

119
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,046
Move away from the door.
We're coming through.

120
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,143
Clear!

121
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,695
Tell me that's just soda pop
in those canisters.

122
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,704
It's just what it looks like. A big IED.

123
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,542
Ten gallons of Astrolite.

124
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,713
Okay. Get everybody outta here.
Clear the area.

125
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:58,928
- Someone's gotta stay here with you.
- I gave you an order to evacuate.

126
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,180
Can you defuse it?

127
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,349
Yes, I can.

128
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,603
- We got four minutes to find out.
- Did you hear what I said?

129
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,022
Get out!

130
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,653
Come on, Mulder.

131
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,656
Mulder, what are you doing!

132
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,618
- Something's wrong!
- Mulder!

133
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,830
- Something's not right.
- Get in the car! There's no time!

134
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,291
Let's go!

135
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,137
Come on, come on!

136
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,334
(sirens)

137
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,372
Next time, you're buying.

138
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,264
(woman) In light of Waco and Ruby Ridge,...

139
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,936
.. there is a need at the Attorney General's
office to place responsibility...

140
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:59,358
.. for the catastrophic destruction of public
property and loss of life due to terrorism.

141
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,988
Details are unclear, but we're under
pressure from the Attorney General...

142
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,784
.. to give a true account of what happened,
so she can issue a public statement.

143
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:13,372
We know now that five people
died in the explosion:

144
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,665
Special...

145
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:23,466
Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud
who was trying to defuse the bomb,...

146
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,177
.. three firemen from Dallas, and a young boy.

147
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:32,475
Excuse me? The firemen and the young boy
were found in the building?

148
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:38,147
Agent Mulder, since you weren't on time
for this hearing, please step outside...

149
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:42,860
.. so that we can hear
Agent Scully's version of the facts.

150
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:49,658
- We were told the building was clear.
- You'll get your turn. Please step outside.

151
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,470
(door opens)

152
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,890
They're still talking to Agent Scully.

153
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,725
About what?

154
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:19,063
They want to know why
she was in the wrong building.

155
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,273
She was with me.

156
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:29,698
You don't get it, do you? There's $45 million
worth of damage to the city of Dallas.

157
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,868
Lives have been lost.
No suspects have been named.

158
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,580
The story is that
this could've been prevented.

159
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,833
They wanna blame us?

160
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:45,214
We both know that if it looks bad,
it's bad for the FBI.

161
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,050
Blame has to be assigned somewhere.

162
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:55,182
- But Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
- She's saying the same about you.

163
00:23:55,308 --> 00:24:01,188
I breached protocol. I broke contact with
the SAC. I left him alone with the device.

164
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,442
Agent Scully says you wanted to go back.

165
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,776
No.

166
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,778
(door opens)

167
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,120
They're asking for you, sir.

168
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,706
Thank you.

169
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,922
- You don't have to protect me.
- I told them the truth.

170
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,633
They're trying to divide us.

171
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,013
They have divided us. They're splitting us up.

172
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,432
What are you talking about?

173
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,269
I meet with OPR in two days
for reassignment.

174
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,687
They put us together!

175
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:46,275
So I could invalidate your investigations
into the paranormal. But...

176
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,611
.. I think this goes deeper than that now.

177
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,907
- They're doing this to me.
- They're not doing this.

178
00:24:56,703 --> 00:25:02,541
I left behind a career in medicine because
I thought I could make a difference at the FBI.

179
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,419
But it hasn't turned out that way.

180
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:11,425
And now if they transfer me to Omaha
or Cleveland or some field office,...

181
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:18,724
.. it doesn't hold the interest for me that it
once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

182
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,436
You're quitting.

183
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,734
Maybe you should ask yourself
if your heart's still in it, too.

184
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,280
(door opens)

185
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,492
Agent Mulder, you're up.

186
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,661
I'm sorry.

187
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,706
Mulder...

188
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,462
Good luck.

189
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:16,532
I'd say this about exceeds
your minimum daily requirement.

190
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,998
Whoa! You've gotta train
for that kind of heavy lifting.

191
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,126
Poopy day?

192
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,799
So,...

193
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,759
.. what do you do?

194
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,846
- What do I do?
- Mm-hm.

195
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:48,814
I'm the key figure in a government plot
to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.

196
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,236
It's a global conspiracy with key players
in the highest levels of power.

197
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:59,199
And it reaches down into the lives of every
man, woman and child on this planet.

198
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,079
So, of course, no-one believes me.

199
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:08,584
I'm an annoyance to my superiors,
a joke to my peers. They call me Spooky.

200
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,962
Spooky Mulder,
whose sister was abducted by aliens,...

201
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,674
.. who chases after little green men
with a badge and a gun,...

202
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,927
.. shouting to the heavens
to anyone who will listen...

203
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,180
.. that the sky is falling.

204
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,976
And when it hits,
it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.

205
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,564
Well...

206
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,111
- I would say that about does it, Spooky.
- Does what?

207
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,989
Looks like 86 is your lucky number.

208
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:52,252
You know, one is the loneliest number.

209
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,745
Hello?

210
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,956
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

211
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,216
(urinating)

212
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,476
That official FBI business?

213
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,812
What?

214
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,524
Bet the Bureau's accusing you
of the same thing in Dallas.

215
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,070
Standing around holding your yank
while bombs are exploding.

216
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,243
Do I know you?

217
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,997
No, but I've been watching your career
for a good while.

218
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,834
Back when you were
a promising young agent. Before that.

219
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,088
- You come out here for a reason?
- Yeah...

220
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,424
- I did.
- (zip)

221
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,011
My name is Kurtzweil.

222
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,180
Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

223
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:30,893
- Am I supposed to know that name?
- Old friend of your father's.

224
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,772
At the State Department
we were fellow travellers.

225
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,942
But his disenchantment outlasted mine.

226
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,445
(zip)

227
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,704
How'd you find me?

228
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:55,250
I heard you come in here.
I figured you'd need a drink tonight.

229
00:29:55,376 --> 00:30:00,088
- You a reporter?
- A doctor, which I mentioned. OB-GYN.

230
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,549
You got something to tell me, say it.

231
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,053
There's something you don't know
about the bombing in Dallas.

232
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,513
What's that?

233
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,850
SAC Darius Michaud never tried
or intended to defuse that bomb.

234
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,770
He just let it explode in his face, huh?

235
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,899
What is no-one asking? Why that building?
Why not the Federal Building?

236
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,151
It was too well guarded.

237
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,654
They bombed the other building...

238
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,782
.. because it did have Federal officers there.

239
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,660
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency...

240
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,330
.. had a quarantine office there,
where the bodies were found.

241
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,334
That's the thing you didn't know.
The thing you'd never think to check.

242
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,087
Those people were already dead.

243
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,049
Before the bomb went off?

244
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,051
That's what I'm saying.

245
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,639
Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran...

246
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:55,644
Michaud was a patriot. The people he was
loyal to know their way around Dallas.

247
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:00,190
They blew that building to hide something.
Something they couldn't predict.

248
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,236
They blew up a building
just to hide the bodies of those firemen?

249
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,321
And one little boy.

250
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,616
I think you're full of shit.

251
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,120
Do you?

252
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,127
Arlington, please.

253
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,311
Actually, no, let's go to Georgetown.

254
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,939
Let's go to Georgetown.

255
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,948
(thunder)

256
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,419
(banging)

257
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,720
- I woke you. Did I wake you?
- No.

258
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,722
Why not? It's 3am.

259
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,933
Are you drunk?

260
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,145
I- I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah.

261
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,565
Was that before or after
you decided to come here?

262
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,484
What are you implying?

263
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,363
- Go home, Mulder.
- No, get dressed.

264
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,907
- It's late.
- Get dressed.

265
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,368
- What are you doing?
- I'll explain on the way.

266
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,106
Got something to show me?

267
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:39,826
We brought the atmosphere back down
to freezing, to control the development,...

268
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,954
.. which is like nothing we've ever seen.

269
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,166
- Brought on by what?
- Heat, I think.

270
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,877
The coincident invasion of a host,...

271
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,129
.. the fireman,...

272
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:56,843
.. and an environment that raised
his body temperature above 98.6.

273
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,813
This man's still alive.

274
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,607
Technically... and biologically.

275
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,151
But... he'll never recover.

276
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,406
How can this be?

277
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:24,704
The developing organism is using
his life energy, digesting bone and tissue.

278
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,375
We've just... slowed the process.

279
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,339
Shall we destroy this one, too?
Before it gestates?

280
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,175
Uh, no. No.

281
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,554
We need to try our vaccine on it.

282
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,098
And if it's unsuccessful?

283
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,560
Burn it. Like the others.

284
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,420
- ID and floor you're visiting.
- The morgue.

285
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,132
That area's currently off limits.

286
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,676
- On whose orders?
- General McAddie.

287
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,972
We were woken at 3am and told
to get down here immediately.

288
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,016
I don't know about that.

289
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,977
- Call General McAddie.
- I don't have the number.

290
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,520
Call the switchboard.

291
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,150
You don't know their number?

292
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:40,238
- I'll call my CO.
- We don't have time for you to dick around.

293
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,033
Our order came from McAddie. Call him.

294
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,829
We'll conduct our business
while you confirm authorisation.

295
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:53,376
Why don't you head on down,
and I'll confirm authorisation.

296
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,253
Thank you.

297
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,758
Why is the morgue suddenly off limits
on the orders of the general?

298
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,678
(Scully) This is one of the firemen
who died in Dallas?

299
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,680
According to the toe tag.

300
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:09,434
- And you're looking for...?
- Cause of death.

301
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,188
I can tell you that
without even looking at him.

302
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:18,485
"Concussive organ failure due to
exposure to source and flying debris. "

303
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,988
Mulder, this man's already been autopsied.

304
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,704
Does this fit the description
you just read me?

305
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:38,046
- Oh, my God! This man's tissue...
- It's like jelly.

306
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:45,136
(Scully) There's been some kind
of cellular breakdown.

307
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,935
God, it's completely oedematous!

308
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:58,108
There's been no autopsy performed.
No Y-incision,...

309
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,735
.. no internal exam.

310
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,406
So the cause of death on that report is false?

311
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,409
This man didn't die from an explosion?

312
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:13,039
I can't tell you what killed this man.
I'm not sure anybody else could, either.

313
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:23,300
Mulder, you knew this man
didn't die at the bomb site.

314
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,178
- I'd been told as much.
- You're saying this is a cover-up?

315
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,722
Of what?

316
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:33,435
I don't know. But I've a hunch it won't be
anything that can be categorised.

317
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:40,108
Mulder, this is gonna take time. Somebody
is gonna figure out we shouldn't be here.

318
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:45,613
We are being blamed for this man's death.
I want to know what he died of. Don't you?

319
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,674
That's it, up here.

320
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:29,449
- Excuse me? Can I help you?
- Is this Dr Kurtzweil's residence?

321
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,789
- You have business with him?
- Yeah, I'm looking for him.

322
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,041
Looking for him for what?

323
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:44,339
The Feds are lookin' for him, too.
Nice business he's got, huh?

324
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,424
What's that?

325
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,720
Selling naked pictures of little kids
on his computer.

326
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:59,187
(cop) You looking for him
for some other reason?

327
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,441
Yeah. I had an appointment
for a pelvic examination.

328
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,369
- You want a call if we find this Kurtzweil?
- Don't bother.

329
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,228
(Kurtzweil) See this crap?
Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

330
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,605
Not according to the men in blue.

331
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,067
Is it kiddie porn again?
Sexual battery of a patient?

332
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:50,822
- They wanna discredit you. Why?
- Because I know too much about the truth.

333
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,950
That end-of-the-world garbage you write?

334
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,952
You know my work?

335
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,457
- I was right about Dallas.
- How?

336
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,209
Do you know of the Hanta virus?

337
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:09,215
Yeah. A deadly virus spread by field mice
several years ago.

338
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:13,803
The newspaper says FEMA was called out
to manage an outbreak.

339
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:19,476
Do you know what the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's real power is?

340
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:25,148
It can suspend constitutional government
upon declaration of a national emergency.

341
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,275
Think about that.

342
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:34,073
What is such a powerful agency doing
managing a small viral outbreak in Texas?

343
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:39,954
- You saying it wasn't a small outbreak?
- No. I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

344
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,831
Well, what was it?

345
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,249
(siren)

346
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,756
What was it?

347
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:57,764
Years ago, your father and I were recruited
for a project. Biological warfare. A virus.

348
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,766
What killed those men?

349
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:04,896
Something I won't even write about.
We have no context for what it is.

350
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,025
Or any appreciation of the scale
at which it will be unleashed.

351
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,236
A plague?

352
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,739
The plague to end all plagues.

353
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,575
A silent weapon for a quiet war.

354
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:23,498
The systematic release of an indiscriminate
organism for which there is no cure.

355
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,793
They've been working on this for 50 years.

356
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:33,132
While the rest of the world fought Commies,
these men were negotiating an Armageddon.

357
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,510
Negotiating with whom?

358
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,720
I think you know.

359
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:43,851
The timetable has been set. It'll happen
on a holiday when people are travelling.

360
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:49,315
A state of emergency will be declared.
Government will come under the power...

361
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,735
.. of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

362
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,156
FEMA. The secret government.

363
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,577
They call me paranoid!

364
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,455
Go back to Dallas, Agent Mulder, and dig.

365
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:10,253
Or we'll find out along with the rest
of the country... when it's too late.

366
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,860
(footsteps)

367
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,760
(phone)

368
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,766
(Mulder) Scully, it's me.

369
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,977
- (whispers) Yeah.
- Why are you whispering?

370
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,937
I can't talk right now.

371
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,442
- What did you find?
- Evidence of a massive infection.

372
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:18,029
- What kind of infection?
- I don't know.

373
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,533
I'm gonna book a flight to Dallas.

374
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,452
I'll get you a ticket, too.

375
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,954
- Mulder...
- I need your expertise.

376
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,917
- It's my hearing tomorrow.
- I'll get you back in time.

377
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,127
Maybe with new evidence.

378
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,547
I can't!
I'm past the point of common sense here.

379
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,760
- It's not common sense. It's...
- (footsteps)

380
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,764
- Are you there? Scul...
- (phone off)

381
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,933
Scully?

382
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,718
(agent) You're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

383
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,680
There was so much devastation,
we haven't put much together yet.

384
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:30,309
I'm looking for anything unusual.
Maybe something from the FEMA offices...

385
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:35,022
- .. where the bodies were found.
- We sent those remains off to Washington.

386
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,776
Anything that you haven't sent off yet?

387
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:45,283
Some bone fragments FEMA recovered
from an archaeological site outta town.

388
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,745
- Have you examined them?
- No. They're just fossils.

389
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,501
I'd like you to let this person
take a look at them.

390
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,923
Just let me get them.

391
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,097
- You said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't planning to.

392
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:13,728
But I got a better look at the samples
I took from the fireman.

393
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,563
And what did you find?

394
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:20,610
Something I couldn't show to anybody else
without causing attention.

395
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:29,202
But what those men were infected with
contains a protein coat I've never seen before.

396
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,037
What it did to them, it did very fast.

397
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,248
- How was it contracted?
- I don't know.

398
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:38,586
But it could be a serious health threat.

399
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,426
These fossils weren't near the blast centre
so they won't tell you much.

400
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,679
Right. Why don't you check this out?

401
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:13,538
- Where were these found?
- I'll show you right on the map.

402
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,034
I want all of these settings checked.

403
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,665
I want a steady minus two degrees Celsius
throughout the transfer of the body...

404
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,334
.. after I've administered the vaccine.

405
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,641
(beeping)

406
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,122
- It's gone!
- It's what?

407
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,667
It's left the body. I think it's gestated.

408
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,881
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

409
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,092
I can see it.

410
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,012
(squelching)

411
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,727
Oh...

412
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,146
Jesus, Lord...

413
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,567
- You see it?
- Yeah.

414
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,278
So much for little green men!

415
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,784
(Bronschweig) I need you down here.

416
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,742
(snarling and screeching)

417
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,246
(Bronschweig screaming)

418
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,127
(creature screams)

419
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,254
(screaming stops)

420
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,387
(groans)

421
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,141
Help... I need help.

422
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,649
What are you doing?

423
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,652
What are you doing!

424
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,739
(gasps)

425
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,912
(panting) Oh, my God!

426
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,795
(screech)

427
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,109
Sir, you have a call.

428
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,664
Yes?

429
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:29,168
(man) We have a situation.
The members are assembling.

430
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,461
Is it an emergency?

431
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:35,633
Yes. A meeting has been set,
tonight in London.

432
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,551
Who called it?

433
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:41,806
Strughold. He just got on a plane in Tunis.

434
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,267
(boy shouting)

435
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,696
(boy crying)

436
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,217
- Has Strughold arrived?
- Yes. They're in the library, sir.

437
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:35,359
We were worried. Some of us have travelled
so far, and you are the last to arrive.

438
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,946
I'm sorry. My grandson broke his leg.

439
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:46,412
While we've been waiting, we've seen
surveillance tapes that raise more concerns.

440
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,831
More concerns than what?

441
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:53,294
We have been forced to reassess
our role in colonisation...

442
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,840
.. by recently presented facts of biology.

443
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,758
The virus has mutated.

444
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,886
Into what?

445
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,015
A new extraterrestrial biological entity.

446
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,351
My God...

447
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:14,815
The geometry of mass infection means
we must re-evaluate their colonisation.

448
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:20,487
This isn't colonisation.
This is spontaneous repopulation.

449
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,657
All our work...

450
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:28,913
If it's true, they've been using us all along.
We've been labouring under a lie.

451
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,125
- It could be an isolated case.
- How can we know?

452
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:37,171
We're going to tell them
what we've learned...

453
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:41,675
.. by turning over a body
infected with the gestating organism.

454
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,721
In hope of what?
Learning that it's true?

455
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:50,643
That we are nothing but digestives
for the creation of a new race of aliens?

456
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,854
By co-operating
we hasten our own demise.

457
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,316
It's the only chance of saving ourselves.

458
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,569
They still need us to make their preparations.

459
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:06,116
We'll continue to use them as they do us,
if only to get more time to work...

460
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,952
.. on our vaccine.

461
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:14,208
My lateness might as well have been
absence. A course has already been taken.

462
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,543
There are complications.

463
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:20,965
Mulder saw one of the infected bodies
we destroyed in Dallas.

464
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,550
He's there now. Someone tipped him.

465
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,760
Who?

466
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:31,725
- Kurtzweil, we think.
- No-one believes Kurtzweil. Or his books.

467
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,769
He's a crank.

468
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,562
Mulder believes him.

469
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:40,401
- Then Kurtzweil must be removed.
- As must Mulder.

470
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:46,448
Kill Mulder... we take the risk
of turning one man's quest into a crusade.

471
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,702
Then take away
what he holds most valuable.

472
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,996
That with which he can't live without.

473
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:02,840
I don't see any evidence of an archaeological
or any other kind of a dig site.

474
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,759
This is where he marked on the map.

475
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:11,098
You're sure those fossils were infected
with the same virus you saw at the morgue?

476
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:16,562
(Scully) Both sets of bones were porous.
As if the virus were decomposing it.

477
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,481
- And you've never seen that virus before?
- No.

478
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,695
Look at that.

479
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:42,504
- (Mulder) That look like new grass to you?
- (Scully) Pretty green for this climate.

480
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,846
Ground's dry about an inch down.
This was laid recently.

481
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,973
The equipment's brand-new, too.

482
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:57,227
No irrigation system.
Somebody's covering their tracks.

483
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,113
Hey!

484
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,658
(Scully) You boys live around here?

485
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,785
Yeah.

486
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,079
Seen anybody digging over there?

487
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,456
We're not supposed to say.

488
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,459
- (Scully) Who told you that?
- Nobody.

489
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,879
(Mulder)
Same nobody that built that playground?

490
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,883
(Mulder) Nobody buy you
those new bikes, too?

491
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:31,345
- You'd better tell us.
- We don't even know you.

492
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,846
We're FBI agents.

493
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,723
You're not FBI agents.

494
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:39,311
- How do you know?
- Cos y'all look like door-to-door salesmen.

495
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,651
Hey, you wanna buy a badge?

496
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,612
They left an hour ago.

497
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,031
Going that way.

498
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,713
(Mulder) Unmarked tanker trucks.

499
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,050
What do archaeologists
haul out in tanker trucks?

500
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,928
- I don't know.
- Where are they going with it?

501
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:16,682
That's the first question to answer
if we're gonna find them.

502
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,860
What are my choices?

503
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:32,698
- 100 miles of nothing in both directions.
- Which way do you think they went?

504
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,033
You got two choices. One's wrong.

505
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,166
- I think they went left.
- I think they went right.

506
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:04,229
Five years together.
How many times have I been wrong?

507
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,440
Never.

508
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,817
Not driving, anyway.

509
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,200
- I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
- This is great. This is fitting.

510
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,744
What?

511
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:07,918
I have to be in Washington DC in 11 hours
for a hearing concerning my career.

512
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:13,006
And I'm in the middle of nowhere,
chasing phantom tanker trucks.

513
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,175
We're chasing evidence.

514
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,426
Of what?

515
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:21,557
That bomb went off to hide something:
bodies infected with a virus you detected.

516
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:27,020
They haul oil in tanker trucks. They haul gas
in tanker trucks. They do not haul viruses.

517
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:31,024
Well, they may be hauling a virus
in these tanker trucks.

518
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,151
What do you mean? Mulder?

519
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,821
What are you not telling me?

520
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,366
- (clears throat)
- Mulder!

521
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,787
The virus may be extraterrestrial.

522
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,502
I don't...

523
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,088
- Mulder, I don't...
- (bell clanging)

524
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,843
(train approaching)

525
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,429
- What do you think they are?
- I have no idea.

526
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,390
This is weird, Mulder.

527
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,350
Very weird.

528
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:14,438
Why would anyone grow corn
in the middle of the desert?

529
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,941
Those could be giant Jiffy Pop poppers.

530
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,362
(hissing sound)

531
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,373
(sudden hissing)

532
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:19,211
(hissing stops)

533
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,556
(Scully) It's cool in here.

534
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,601
The temperature's being regulated.

535
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,728
For the purpose of what?

536
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:41,650
I think we're on top of a larger structure.
This is some kind of a venting system.

537
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,902
Do you hear something?

538
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,737
(low humming)

539
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,911
I hear a humming. Like electricity.

540
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,622
High voltage, maybe.

541
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,749
Maybe.

542
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,340
Maybe not.

543
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,307
Scully...

544
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,935
- Yeah?
- Run!

545
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:22,732
(buzzing)

546
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:31,950
Scully!

547
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,536
I can't see!

548
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,416
Give me your hand!

549
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,387
- Did you get stung?
- I don't think so.

550
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,213
Talk to me, Scully!

551
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,007
(shouts) Scully!

552
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,677
Damn it! Scully!

553
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,893
Scully!

554
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:23,728
(shouts) Scully!

555
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,231
Talk to me, Scully!

556
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,857
Mulder!

557
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,363
Scully!

558
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,699
Mulder!

559
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,450
(Mulder) Can you hear me?

560
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,326
Mulder...

561
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:58,596
Scully!

562
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,099
Mulder!

563
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:02,142
Scully!

564
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,144
Scully, talk to me!

565
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,437
Mulder...

566
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,111
Where'd they go?

567
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,950
Come on!

568
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,644
She's coming in.

569
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,322
Special Agent Scully.

570
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,574
I apologise for making you wait.

571
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,035
I have new evidence.

572
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,828
Evidence of what?

573
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:09,542
These are fossilised bone fragments...

574
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:14,506
.. that were gathered
at the bomb site in Dallas.

575
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:17,884
- You've been back to Dallas?
- Yes.

576
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:31,272
- You found something.
- In Texas, some kind of experiment.

577
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,900
Tankers carrying something they excavated.

578
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:38,404
- What?
- I'm not sure. A virus, I think.

579
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:44,786
I also have reason to believe that there may
have been involvement by SAC Michaud.

580
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:49,666
Those are very serious allegations,
Agent Scully.

581
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,043
Yes, I know.

582
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:55,088
- You saw this experiment?
- Yeah. We were chased off.

583
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:59,259
- What did it look like?
- There were bees, corn crops.

584
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:04,722
And you have conclusive evidence
to tie your claim to the crime?

585
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:14,232
Not completely conclusive. We're working
towards gathering that evidence.

586
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:15,900
Working with?

587
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,196
With Agent Mulder.

588
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:24,284
- What are they?
- What do you think?

589
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:29,747
Transportation system. Transgenic crops.
The pollen altered to carry a virus.

590
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,332
That's my guess.

591
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,086
Guess?

592
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:38,923
What do you mean?
Hey! You told me you had answers.

593
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,301
Yeah, but I don't have 'em all.

594
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:45,471
- You didn't know my father.
- He and I were old friends.

595
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:49,392
You've used me
to gather information for your books!

596
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,477
Lower your voice!

597
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,524
Kurtzweil!

598
01:09:56,650 --> 01:10:02,989
You'd be shit out of luck if it wasn't for me.
I put my ass on the line for you.

599
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:06,534
I just got chased
by two black helicopters!

600
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,996
And why do you think
you're here talking to me?

601
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,415
These people don't make mistakes.

602
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,964
(fire escape creaks)

603
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,009
(knocking)

604
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,890
What's wrong?

605
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:16,187
Salt Lake City, Utah.
Transfer effective immediately.

606
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,692
I already gave Skinner
my letter of resignation.

607
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,694
You can't quit now.

608
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,573
I can, Mulder. I debated
whether to tell you in person...

609
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,159
We're on the verge here!

610
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:34,163
You're on the verge.
Please don't do this to me.

611
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:38,042
After all you've seen,
you can just walk away?

612
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:40,753
I have. I did. It's done.

613
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,632
- I need you on this...
- You don't need me.

614
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,052
You never have.
I've just held you back.

615
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,434
I gotta go.

616
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:02,775
If you wanna tell yourself that, you can.
But you're wrong.

617
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:05,486
Why did they assign me to you?

618
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:08,239
To debunk your work.
To shut you down.

619
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:10,074
But you saved me!

620
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,953
As frustrating as it's been sometimes,...

621
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:19,125
.. your strict rationalism and science
have saved me a thousand times over.

622
01:12:19,251 --> 01:12:21,336
You kept me honest.

623
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:27,592
You made me a whole person.
I owe you everything.

624
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:31,679
Scully, you owe me nothing.

625
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,354
I don't know if I wanna do this alone.

626
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,192
I don't even know if I can.

627
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,947
And if I quit now, they win.

628
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,961
(Scully sighs)

629
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,714
Ow! Jesus!

630
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:49,799
I'm sorry.

631
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,343
No... Something stung me.

632
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,852
Must've gotten in your shirt.

633
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,728
Mulder,...

634
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,940
.. something's wrong.

635
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,525
What?

636
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:13,030
- I'm having lancinating pain in my chest.
- What?

637
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,740
Scully!

638
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:21,330
My motor functions are being affected.
My... pulse is thready.

639
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,751
I have a funny taste in the back of my throat.

640
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,797
- It must be anaphylactic shock.
- I have no allergy...

641
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,092
(laboured breathing)

642
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:42,143
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.
I have an agent down!

643
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,147
(medic) Can you hear me?
Can you say your name?

644
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:52,612
(medic) She has constriction in the throat.
Let's get her in the van right away!

645
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:58,117
She said she had a funny taste in her throat.
But she has no allergy to bee stings.

646
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:00,953
The bee that stung her
might have been carrying a virus.

647
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:05,958
- Get on the radio. Tell them...
- Tell them it may have been carrying a virus!

648
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:09,003
(Mulder) I wanna go with her.
What hospital? I...

649
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,756
What hospital are you taking her to?

650
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,440
(approaching siren)

651
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,948
- What are you doing?
- Reading his chart.

652
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:03,743
- Put it down.
- When I'm ready.

653
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:07,288
- I think he's coming out of it.
- He's coming to.

654
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,499
Hey, Mulder.

655
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,293
Mulder?

656
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:15,921
Oh, my God...

657
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:22,720
Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, Toto.

658
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,517
What am I doin' here?

659
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:33,105
- A bullet grazed your temporal plate.
- 3cms left and we'd be playing harps.

660
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:35,733
You've been unconscious since you got here.

661
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,401
Where's Scully?

662
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,988
Your 911 call must have been intercepted.

663
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:45,660
Scully had a reaction
to a honeybee we found in your hall.

664
01:17:45,786 --> 01:17:49,538
- I gotta get to her.
- You're staying right here.

665
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,666
This goes back to Dallas.

666
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:55,294
- Where is she? I'll find her.
- I don't know where she is.

667
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:01,467
You leave here unprotected, how far
will you get? How far will they let you get?

668
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:03,678
What can we do?

669
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,598
You can strip Byers naked.

670
01:18:07,724 --> 01:18:08,849
What?

671
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,769
I need your clothes.

672
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,925
It's Mulder.

673
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,712
Dr Kurtzweil? Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

674
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:13,516
Mr Mulder.

675
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,395
What happened to Kurtzweil?

676
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,273
He's come and gone.

677
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:23,150
Where's Scully?

678
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:28,322
The location of Agent Scully
and the means to save her life.

679
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:30,199
Please.

680
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:11,737
What is it?

681
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:15,365
A weak vaccine against the virus
Agent Scully has been infected with.

682
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:18,660
It must be administered
within 96 hours.

683
01:21:18,745 --> 01:21:21,705
That leaves you little time
to reach those coordinates.

684
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:26,168
- You're lying.
- No.

685
01:21:26,252 --> 01:21:28,837
Though I have no means
to prove otherwise.

686
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:31,465
The virus is extraterrestrial.

687
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:36,303
We know very little about it except that it was
the original inhabitant of this planet.

688
01:21:36,387 --> 01:21:38,305
A virus.

689
01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:41,850
What is a virus
but a colonizing force...

690
01:21:41,934 --> 01:21:43,935
that cannot be defeated...

691
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:48,565
living in a cave underground
until it mutates and attacks?

692
01:21:49,901 --> 01:21:52,819
This is what you've been
conspiring to conceal?

693
01:21:52,904 --> 01:21:56,698
- A disease?
- No, for God's sake. You've got it all backwards.

694
01:21:56,783 --> 01:21:59,451
Al DS, the Ebola virus

695
01:21:59,535 --> 01:22:01,953
on an evolutionary scale
they are newborns.

696
01:22:02,038 --> 01:22:05,916
This virus walked the planet
long before the dinosaurs.

697
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,543
What do you mean "walked"?

698
01:22:08,628 --> 01:22:12,130
Your aliens, Agent Mulder,
your little green men...

699
01:22:12,215 --> 01:22:14,299
arrived here millions ofyears ago.

700
01:22:14,383 --> 01:22:17,302
Those that didn't leave
have been lying dormant underground...

701
01:22:17,386 --> 01:22:19,304
since the last ice age...

702
01:22:19,388 --> 01:22:21,807
in the form
ofan evolved pathogen...

703
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:26,186
waiting to be reconstituted
by the alien race...

704
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:28,814
when it comes
to colonize the planet...

705
01:22:28,898 --> 01:22:30,899
using us as hosts.

706
01:22:30,983 --> 01:22:33,318
Against this we have no defense.

707
01:22:33,402 --> 01:22:35,403
Nothing but a weak vaccine.

708
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:38,573
Do you see why it was kept secret...

709
01:22:38,658 --> 01:22:43,662
why even the best men, men like your father,
could not let the truth be known?

710
01:22:43,746 --> 01:22:47,165
Until Dallas, we believed the virus
would simply control us...

711
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:50,752
that mass infection
would make us a slave race.

712
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:55,382
Imagine our surprise
when they began to gestate.

713
01:22:56,926 --> 01:23:00,512
My group has been working
cooperatively with the alien colonists...

714
01:23:00,596 --> 01:23:03,682
facilitating programs
like the one you saw...

715
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:05,684
to give us access to the virus...

716
01:23:05,768 --> 01:23:09,104
in hope that we might be able
secretly to develop a cure.

717
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:13,108
To save your own asses.

718
01:23:13,192 --> 01:23:15,360
Survival is the ultimate ideology.

719
01:23:15,444 --> 01:23:17,362
Your father wisely
refused to believe this.

720
01:23:17,446 --> 01:23:20,657
But he sacrificed my sister.
He let them take Samantha.

721
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:25,036
Without a vaccination,
the only true survivors ofthe viral holocaust...

722
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:28,623
will be those immune to it
human-alien clones.

723
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:31,126
He allowedyour sister
to be abducted...

724
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:34,045
to be taken to a cloning program
for one reason.

725
01:23:36,632 --> 01:23:39,050
So she would survive...

726
01:23:40,803 --> 01:23:42,762
as a genetic hybrid.

727
01:23:42,847 --> 01:23:46,725
Your father chose hope
over selfishness.

728
01:23:46,809 --> 01:23:49,561
Hope in the only future he had
his children.

729
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:53,690
His hope for you was that you
would uncover the truth about the project.

730
01:23:53,774 --> 01:23:57,360
That you would stop it.
That you would fight the future.

731
01:24:02,116 --> 01:24:04,659
Why are you telling me this?

732
01:24:04,744 --> 01:24:07,454
For the sake of my own children.

733
01:24:07,538 --> 01:24:11,666
Once it's learned what I've told you,
my life will be over.

734
01:24:20,468 --> 01:24:22,510
Where's Dr. Kurtzweil?

735
01:24:26,849 --> 01:24:29,226
I'd like to get out of the car now.

736
01:24:30,811 --> 01:24:33,104
Stop the car!

737
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:35,482
Driver.

738
01:24:56,042 --> 01:25:02,131
The men I work with will strongly protect
their stake in the inevitable future.

739
01:25:03,633 --> 01:25:09,138
I was ordered to kill Dr Kurtzweil.
As I was ordered to kill you.

740
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:16,312
Trust no-one, Mr Mulder.

741
01:25:21,109 --> 01:25:22,484
Get out of the car.

742
01:25:25,447 --> 01:25:28,115
Why? The upholstery's already ruined.

743
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:29,825
Get out of the car!

744
01:25:40,128 --> 01:25:42,671
You have precious little time.

745
01:25:42,797 --> 01:25:48,302
What I've given you,
the alien colonists don't yet know exists.

746
01:25:48,428 --> 01:25:51,847
That vaccine is the only defence
against the virus.

747
01:25:52,057 --> 01:25:55,142
Introducing it into an alien environment...

748
01:25:55,268 --> 01:26:00,856
.. may destroy the plans we have so
assiduously protected for the last 50 years.

749
01:26:00,982 --> 01:26:03,525
What do you mean, may?

750
01:26:03,651 --> 01:26:09,406
Find Agent Scully. Only then
will you realise the scope of the project.

751
01:26:10,575 --> 01:26:11,408
Go!

752
01:26:13,244 --> 01:26:15,371
Go now!

753
01:28:01,561 --> 01:28:03,103
(engine splutters)

754
01:34:50,803 --> 01:34:51,845
Shit!

755
01:34:54,432 --> 01:34:56,224
(yelling)

756
01:37:15,322 --> 01:37:19,159
Secure the station!
I want everyone else below.

757
01:37:19,285 --> 01:37:22,037
Arm yourselves.
We may have a breach.

758
01:37:37,136 --> 01:37:38,845
Let's go! Let's go!

759
01:38:20,763 --> 01:38:21,930
Scully?

760
01:38:34,944 --> 01:38:36,152
(bleeping)

761
01:38:36,445 --> 01:38:38,947
There's a contaminant in the system.

762
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:43,326
Mulder has the vaccine.

763
01:38:43,452 --> 01:38:45,954
(cracking and hissing)

764
01:38:55,506 --> 01:38:58,299
(Scully gags)

765
01:39:03,806 --> 01:39:05,598
Breathe!

766
01:39:05,724 --> 01:39:07,142
Scully, can you breathe?

767
01:39:07,268 --> 01:39:09,352
(coughing)

768
01:39:14,608 --> 01:39:16,192
Cold...

769
01:39:16,318 --> 01:39:18,903
- I'm cold...
- I'll get you out.

770
01:39:21,490 --> 01:39:23,700
(confused shouting)

771
01:39:24,118 --> 01:39:27,662
Abandon your posts! Evacuate!

772
01:39:28,998 --> 01:39:30,665
(buzzing)

773
01:39:36,463 --> 01:39:40,091
- What's happened?
- It's all going to hell!

774
01:39:40,217 --> 01:39:42,218
- What about Mulder?
- He won't make it.

775
01:39:42,344 --> 01:39:44,512
(clanging and creaking)

776
01:40:05,201 --> 01:40:07,285
(rumbling)

777
01:40:19,215 --> 01:40:21,299
(alarm)

778
01:40:26,597 --> 01:40:28,681
(men shouting)

779
01:41:15,521 --> 01:41:18,314
(Scully and Mulder panting)

780
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,275
(Scully coughing)

781
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:28,074
We gotta keep movin'.

782
01:41:28,492 --> 01:41:29,450
Come on!

783
01:41:29,576 --> 01:41:31,953
(breathless) I can't.

784
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:34,163
Yeah, you can.

785
01:41:51,974 --> 01:41:54,809
Scully, grab that vent.

786
01:41:57,229 --> 01:41:59,981
(shouts) Scully, grab the vent!

787
01:42:01,233 --> 01:42:03,526
Scully...

788
01:42:14,788 --> 01:42:16,914
(screeching)

789
01:42:30,304 --> 01:42:31,387
Jeez, breathe!

790
01:42:35,934 --> 01:42:37,727
(growling)

791
01:42:37,853 --> 01:42:40,396
Breathe! Come on!

792
01:42:40,522 --> 01:42:41,481
(gasps)

793
01:42:41,607 --> 01:42:43,983
(coughing)

794
01:42:45,569 --> 01:42:47,695
Breathe in.

795
01:42:47,905 --> 01:42:50,823
Breathe in... Breathe!

796
01:42:52,242 --> 01:42:54,535
I had you big time.

797
01:43:10,886 --> 01:43:12,136
(shouts) Pull!

798
01:43:12,262 --> 01:43:14,806
Come on, Scully! Pull!

799
01:43:17,393 --> 01:43:19,519
Mulder...

800
01:43:28,737 --> 01:43:30,113
Keep movin'!

801
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:35,243
(Scully gasping)

802
01:43:35,911 --> 01:43:37,912
(Mulder) Go! Come on!

803
01:43:43,419 --> 01:43:46,045
(Mulder) Almost there. Keep going.

804
01:43:46,422 --> 01:43:48,089
(hissing screech)

805
01:43:51,802 --> 01:43:54,595
(screeching)

806
01:43:56,974 --> 01:43:58,850
(explosion)

807
01:44:33,385 --> 01:44:36,679
(rumbling)

808
01:46:15,988 --> 01:46:17,947
You gotta see this.

809
01:46:18,073 --> 01:46:20,157
Scully!

810
01:48:01,176 --> 01:48:07,598
In light of your report and narrative,
my official report is incomplete,...

811
01:48:07,849 --> 01:48:10,935
.. pending these new facts
I'm being asked to reconcile.

812
01:48:11,061 --> 01:48:17,233
Though it seems that a federal agent
may have been involved in the bombing,...

813
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:21,904
.. the other events you've laid down
are too incredible on their own...

814
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:26,909
- .. and, quite frankly, implausible.
- What is it you find incredible?

815
01:48:27,035 --> 01:48:28,786
Where should I start?

816
01:48:28,912 --> 01:48:33,958
So many of the events
described in your report defy belief.

817
01:48:34,084 --> 01:48:37,169
Antarctica is a long way from Dallas.

818
01:48:37,295 --> 01:48:42,967
I can't give the Attorney General a report
that alleges the links you've made here.

819
01:48:43,218 --> 01:48:48,639
Bees and corn crops
don't come under domestic terrorism.

820
01:48:49,182 --> 01:48:51,308
No, they don't.

821
01:48:52,602 --> 01:48:59,692
(Cassidy) Your report doesn't show
any organisation with an attributable motive.

822
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:05,156
I realise your ordeal affected you,
but the holes in your account...

823
01:49:05,282 --> 01:49:09,952
.. leave us with no choice
but to delete these references...

824
01:49:10,078 --> 01:49:17,918
.. until hard evidence becomes available that
could cause us to pursue an investigation.

825
01:49:39,733 --> 01:49:47,239
I don't believe the FBI has an investigative
unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.

826
01:50:28,365 --> 01:50:32,618
There's an interesting work of fiction
on page 24.

827
01:50:32,744 --> 01:50:35,913
Mysteriously,
our names have been omitted.

828
01:50:36,706 --> 01:50:41,919
They're burying it. They're gonna
dig a new hole and cover it up.

829
01:50:42,045 --> 01:50:45,172
I told OPR everything I know.

830
01:50:45,298 --> 01:50:52,012
What I experienced, the virus, how it's spread
by the bees and transgenic crops.

831
01:50:52,138 --> 01:50:53,681
They won't believe you.

832
01:50:53,932 --> 01:50:57,726
Not unless your story can be categorised
or easily referenced.

833
01:50:57,853 --> 01:51:00,271
- We'll go over their heads.
- No. No.

834
01:51:00,397 --> 01:51:03,274
How many times
have we been here before?

835
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,110
Right here?
So close to the truth.

836
01:51:06,236 --> 01:51:09,780
And now,
to be back at the beginning with nothing!

837
01:51:09,906 --> 01:51:11,740
This is different.

838
01:51:11,867 --> 01:51:18,289
No, it isn't. You're right to want to quit. You
should get as far away from me as you can.

839
01:51:18,415 --> 01:51:21,667
You won't die
because of a hollow cause of mine!

840
01:51:21,793 --> 01:51:24,587
Go be a doctor.

841
01:51:24,713 --> 01:51:27,631
Go be a doctor while you still can.

842
01:51:30,677 --> 01:51:32,845
I can't. I won't.

843
01:51:32,971 --> 01:51:37,641
I'll be a doctor,
but my work is here with you now.

844
01:51:37,767 --> 01:51:40,436
That virus that I was exposed to,...

845
01:51:40,562 --> 01:51:46,567
.. whatever it is, it has a cure.
You held it in your hand.

846
01:51:49,321 --> 01:51:52,031
How many other lives can we save?

847
01:51:55,076 --> 01:51:56,952
Look,...

848
01:52:01,249 --> 01:52:04,919
.. if I quit now, they win.

849
01:52:48,213 --> 01:52:50,297
(man shouting)

850
01:52:59,224 --> 01:53:02,851
You look hot.
Why have you travelled all this way?

851
01:53:02,978 --> 01:53:04,853
We have business to discuss.

852
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:09,858
- You have regular channels.
- This involves Mulder.

853
01:53:09,985 --> 01:53:14,238
- That name! Again and again.
- He's seen more than he should.

854
01:53:14,364 --> 01:53:18,033
Of the whole, he has seen but pieces.

855
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:22,246
He's determined now. Reinvested.

856
01:53:25,792 --> 01:53:27,835
He's but one man.

857
01:53:28,586 --> 01:53:31,755
One man alone cannot fight the future.

858
01:53:32,507 --> 01:53:34,550
Yesterday...

859
01:53:34,801 --> 01:53:36,844
.. I received this.
