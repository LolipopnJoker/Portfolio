1
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,446
Check. Head count.
Head count. Two. Three.

2
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,989
Four. Five.

3
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,490
Six.

4
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,118
Demo set.

5
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,494
Let's move.

6
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,218
Clear.

7
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,363
Low Boy, this is Black Cat.

8
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,199
ETA Romeo, L-Z-one-niner.

9
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,825
We are hot. Copy.

10
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,581
Come on. Get out there!
Go, go!

11
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,543
Come on.

12
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,465
Get in!

13
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,637
Cover! I'm on the roof!

14
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:09,893
Go!

15
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,864
This is Low Boy.
Package is wrapped.

16
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,673
Ladies and gentlemen...

17
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,678
three weeks ago,
Russian and American special forces...

18
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,764
apprehended the self-proclaimed leader
of Kazakhstan...

19
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,184
General Ivan Radek.

20
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,900
The forces of Radek were directed
toward the suppression of democracy.

21
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,570
His nuclear arsenal
could have brought the world...

22
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,280
into a new cold war.

23
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:08,118
But thanks to the support of one
of the world's greatest leaders...

24
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,455
Radek is now in prison.

25
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,670
Today we are honoring this brave man.

26
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,466
Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend...

27
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,969
the president of the
United States of America.

28
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,613
The dead remember our indifference.

29
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,032
The dead remember our silence.

30
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,493
I came here tonight
to be congratulated.

31
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,038
But today when I visited
the Red Cross camps...

32
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,458
overwhelmed by the flood of refugees...

33
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,961
fleeing from the horror
of Kazakhstan...

34
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,674
I realized I don't deserve
to be congratulated, none of us do.

35
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,134
- What's he doing?
- That's not the speech.

36
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,594
The truth is...

37
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,055
we acted too late.

38
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,643
Only when our own national security
was threatened did we act.

39
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:20,774
Radek's regime murdered over 200,000
men, women and children...

40
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,776
and we watched it on TV.

41
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,988
We let it happen.
People were being slaughtered...

42
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,365
for over a year.

43
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:33,245
We issued economic sanctions and hid
behind the rhetoric of diplomacy.

44
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,705
How dare we?

45
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,040
The dead remember.

46
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,542
Real peace...

47
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:43,505
is not just the absence of conflict,
it's the presence of justice.

48
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,093
Tonight I come to you with a pledge
to change America's policy.

49
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,387
Never again...

50
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:54,099
will I allow
our political self-interest...

51
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,394
to deter us from doing what we know
to be morally right.

52
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,898
Atrocity and terror
are not political weapons.

53
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,941
And to those who would use them...

54
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,653
your day is over.

55
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,199
We will never negotiate.

56
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,954
We will no longer tolerate
and we will no longer be afraid.

57
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,084
It's your turn to be afraid.

58
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,580
The Russian was a nice touch.

59
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,041
Tell my mother.
She wanted me to study French.

60
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,963
- Do you know what you committed us to?
- I know exactly what I committed us to.

61
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,596
Gentlemen,
welcome to "Air Force One. "

62
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,266
Please present your equipment
for inspection.

63
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,726
We were just inspected at the gate.

64
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,271
This plane carries the president
of the United States.

65
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,273
I understand. I'm terribly sorry.

66
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,819
Please place your thumb
on the I.D. pad.

67
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,329
Access cleared.

68
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,682
Hello. I'm Melanie Mitchell,
deputy press secretary.

69
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,143
- I'll be taking you in from here.
- Oh, Miss Mitchell.

70
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,478
It is so nice to finally meet you
in person.

71
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,856
The president and I were delighted
we could accommodate your news crew.

72
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,233
So, if you boys are all cleared?

73
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:12,696
The president's on a very tight schedule
so this is how it works.

74
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,698
During the flight,
two members of your crew...

75
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,909
will be allowed outside the press area
for filming.

76
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,162
You'll get exactly 10 minutes
with the president, 20 with the crew.

77
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,338
Gary, the president is ready
to take Congress on.

78
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,131
He's not gonna kiss their ass
for each vote.

79
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,551
Let them vote us down
and stand on their record.

80
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,929
Yeah, I'm with him now.
I'll call you from the plane.

81
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,432
- What did they say about the speech?
- Your speech is leading the news.

82
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,434
They're calling it
the "Be Afraid" speech.

83
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,894
Good.

84
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,021
With all due respect,
next time you want to make...

85
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,148
a major policy departure,
you might want to discuss it...

86
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,025
with your national security advisor
first.

87
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,862
- We did discuss it, Jack.
- We discussed it...

88
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,365
in private, which is where I thought
it would remain.

89
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,368
Now it's public.
Now it's policy.

90
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,120
Get behind it.

91
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,957
The allies are going to be very upset
they weren't consulted about this.

92
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,292
It might come back and bite us
in the ass in November.

93
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,753
It's the right thing to do.

94
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,296
You know it.

95
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,050
There goes the neighborhood.

96
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,887
If you'd like,
we have time for a quick tour.

97
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,931
- We'd be delighted.
- Good.

98
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,599
Andrei, Boris.

99
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,351
Follow me.

100
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,771
Ahead of this staff cabin
is Secret Service. Right here.

101
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,483
Never try to go past them without
an escort or you'll be very sorry.

102
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,735
- Hello.
- Hi.

103
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,405
Thanks for the warning.

104
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,699
Here we have
our in-flight offices.

105
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,852
A lot of the plane's features
are classified.

106
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,313
But I can tell you
it's bullet-resistant...

107
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,983
and it's even protected against
the pulse of a nuclear blast.

108
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,194
I'm not sure that's very comforting.

109
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,532
Upstairs is the cockpit along with the
most advanced communications center...

110
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,243
on or above the face of the earth.

111
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,162
We could run the whole country
from here.

112
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,289
Or even a war if we had to.

113
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,375
Just last week, the president called
the shuttle astronauts from there.

114
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,629
The president's arriving.
They should take their seats.

115
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,172
Right away.

116
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,841
I'll get out of here and let you all
get some sleep.

117
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,734
- Mr. President, welcome aboard.
- Hey, Danny. How are you?

118
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,319
Mr. President!

119
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,032
Change in plan, Danny.
Let's go to Barbados.

120
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,034
Anything you want.
You're the president.

121
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,661
Boy, I wish.

122
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,038
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Gibbs, where's my bunch?

123
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,374
Ballet ran late.
They'll be here in five minutes.

124
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,502
- Lewis, you tape the game?
- It was a real squeaker, sir.

125
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,880
Don't brief me on it.
I wanted to watch it, for Christ's sake.

126
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,716
We'll be underway
in about 30 minutes, sir.

127
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
Mr. President.

128
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,346
Could you put the game on now?
Yeah, Jack?

129
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,473
The Iraqis have mobilized
two armored brigades toward...

130
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,018
Just got it. Give me 15 minutes.
Get the guys together.

131
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,397
"Repel them.
Make them relinquish the ball. "

132
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,316
- Did you hear about Notre Dame?
- Don't. Don't tell me the score.

133
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,235
- Great game.
- Mr. President.

134
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,737
We need to strategize,
smooth some things out politically.

135
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,739
- What was that?
- It's not so important.

136
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,284
- Damage control. What if...
- Give me a minute alone.

137
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,786
What if a "high-ranking
White House official"...

138
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,788
Just give me a few moments alone.

139
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,791
A "high-ranking official" were
to qualify what you said last night?

140
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,294
Drop it. Do yourself a favor.

141
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,003
It's policy.
Drop it.

142
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,214
- Or find another ride home. Yeah?
- The Russian news crew's with us.

143
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,676
I told them you'd give them a sound bite
about life in the White House.

144
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,511
There is no life in the White House.

145
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,890
You said it.
The president needs some time alone.

146
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,602
14-13 Michigan!

147
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:14,021
All right, Mr. President!

148
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,651
That wasn't you napping
during the performance, was it, Tom?

149
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,237
No, ma'am. It was very enjoyable.

150
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,532
Alice, you can finish it on the plane.
Let's not keep your father waiting.

151
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,827
Try and smile, sweetheart. Okay?

152
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,414
- Alice, one picture, please!
- Thank you very much.

153
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,926
Great, something from Tom.

154
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,969
Shh. Daddy's asleep.

155
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,600
How was the ballet?

156
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,019
It was great!

157
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,066
You trying to kill me?
Wait it really good? Did you enjoy it?

158
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,985
Did you love it? Men in tights?
Did you hear my speech?

159
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

160
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,533
- You're gonna get yourself reelected.
- That's what I keep telling them.

161
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,208
This is the aircraft commander.
We'll take to the runway in a moment.

162
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,294
- Are you guys comfortable?
- Yes, very.

163
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,422
- I brought you V.I.P. press kits.
- Thank you.

164
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,924
You're welcome.

165
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,022
Pass interference.
That's cheating.

166
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,067
- Only if they get caught.
- Dad!

167
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,111
The way of the world, kiddo.

168
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:52,536
Why didn't you take me with you
when you went to the refugee camp today?

169
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,458
For one thing,
it's not 100 percent secure.

170
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,757
You've got your whole life to live.
You don't need to see that stuff.

171
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,761
Come on, Dad. It's not like
I don't see it on the news.

172
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,805
It's different on the news.

173
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,642
All I'm saying is I'm ready for things
you don't think I'm ready for.

174
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,811
Maybe I'm not ready.

175
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,981
I'm 12 years old, Dad!
In the caveman days...

176
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,358
I'd be having children of my own.

177
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,404
That's what we call progress. You're
missing the best part of the game.

178
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,115
God!

179
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,454
We're so looking forward to seeing you.

180
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,709
- She is so anxious to grow up.
- I know. She's...

181
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,920
Yes, the both of us.

182
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,088
Okay. Bye, bye.

183
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,385
Well, she couldn't stay
your little girl forever, Jim.

184
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:53,931
I was hoping it would last
till she was 14 or 15.

185
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,725
Or 50.

186
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,230
They hated your speech, didn't they?

187
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,815
They're afraid we won't have the guts
to back it up.

188
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,818
And, then, if we do,
it'll be political suicide.

189
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,488
Remember our first campaign?

190
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,532
- In the House?
- Yeah.

191
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,993
- Downstate, driving around with...
- Who was that kid, our volunteer?

192
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,538
- Henry.
- Henry with the convertible.

193
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,207
- With the broken top.
- And the snow coming in.

194
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:23,418
We were the only three people
who thought you could win that.

195
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:27,089
You didn't give a damn. You knew
what needed to be done and you did it.

196
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,301
And you spoke from your heart.
That's what I heard tonight.

197
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,139
Well, it felt good.

198
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,560
I'll bet it did.

199
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,487
Sorry to interrupt.
Everybody's assembled, sir.

200
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,828
United States "Air Force One. "

201
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,207
It is an honor to clear you
for immediate takeoff on runway 2-5.

202
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,418
"Air Force One" cleared for takeoff.

203
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,545
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow.

204
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,018
In Moscow tonight,
President Marshall defended...

205
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,437
the military action
against the Radek regime...

206
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:08,941
an act the administration had
been calling a one-time intervention.

207
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,943
But in a rare display of emotion...

208
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,780
the president alluded to a change
in U.S. foreign policy when he stated...

209
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,248
that America will no longer tolerate
any terrorist government.

210
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,287
Meanwhile in Kazakhstan, Radek's ouster
stalled the neo-communist revolution.

211
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,290
These are two of Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guard brigades...

212
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,084
that have been moved north.

213
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,378
He knows we're watching,
knows we'll retaliate.

214
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,713
Why the hell is he sending tanks
to the border?

215
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,550
Could be a response to your speech,
Mr. President.

216
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,677
- Maybe he's got a son-in-law up there.
- Very funny.

217
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,388
I think there's one or two
he hasn't shot yet.

218
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,431
What does State have to say?

219
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,684
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming
it's just an exercise.

220
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,479
Let's not waste more time.
Send the "Nimitz" back in.

221
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,528
- Gibbs.
- Guys.

222
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:05,914
- Sleeping on the job?
- No, sir.

223
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,521
Hey, guys...

224
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:26,560
these are the advance team reports
from the Miami field agent.

225
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,979
- Take a look at them.
- Thank you.

226
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,158
Smoke.
There's smoke!

227
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,540
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin.

228
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,585
Everybody move to the back of the plane.
Now! Please!

229
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,296
Smoke! Notify the cockpit!

230
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,311
Mr. President, stay back.

231
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,234
Everybody down!

232
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:11,582
Code red! We have a code red!
I repeat. Shots fired on board.

233
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,585
Code red acknowledged.
Lock that door now.

234
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,920
Flight control, this is "Air Force One"
declaring emergency.

235
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,215
Cover us!

236
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,758
Stay back.

237
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,263
Move up!
I'll cover you.

238
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,390
Go! Go!

239
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,310
- What's going on?
- Shots fired, sir.

240
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,104
- What about my family?
- We're handling it, sir.

241
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,523
Boy Scout coming out!
Cover!

242
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,358
- Give us cover!
- Daddy?

243
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,902
Alice, get back!

244
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,947
Alice, get down!

245
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,575
- Take him around here.
- Get down.

246
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,118
This is "Air Force One. "

247
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,787
We are code red.
Shots fired on board.

248
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,707
Request emergency assistance.
ETA 15 minutes.

249
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,544
Acknowledged. We are scrambling
our fighters. Emergency equipment...

250
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,630
will be standing by.

251
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,433
Get him to the escape pod!

252
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,310
Boy Scout is headed to the vault.

253
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,230
The football!
The football!

254
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,527
Get him around here.

255
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,363
Get him down to the pod!

256
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,990
Don't move!

257
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:28,891
Get the president!

258
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,498
- They're on us.
- Where's my family?

259
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,042
- Get in the pod, sir. Get in!
- What about my family?

260
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:48,262
"Air Force One," landing runway 0-9.
I repeat, runway 0-9.

261
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,807
Roger. Turning to heading 1-8-5.
Descending to 5,000 feet.

262
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,508
Hurry, he's in the escape pod.

263
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:25,424
Ramstein, this is "Air Force One. "

264
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:29,219
Emergency pod has been deployed.
I repeat.

265
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,972
- The emergency pod has been deployed.
- Ramstein tower, acknowledge.

266
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,725
We are picking up the homing beacon
and deploying search and rescue.

267
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,984
- Is the locking ready to look at?
- Just about, sir.

268
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,486
- Has General Northwood arrived?
- Yes, he has.

269
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,283
- Give me an update.
- Madam Vice President, this way.

270
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,744
- We'll avoid the press.
- Is the president secure?

271
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,871
Not yet. The recovery team
will have him very soon.

272
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,761
"Air Force One"...

273
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,263
this is Halo Flight Lead,:
you are under escort.

274
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:16,683
All airspace has been cleared.
Alert force has been mobilized.

275
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,727
- Is everyone here?
- We're working on it.

276
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,605
How did this happen?
How did they get "Air Force One"?

277
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,024
Gentlemen. Mr. Secretary.

278
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,028
Ramstein tower, we are at ten mile...

279
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:30,405
Final coming in red hot.

280
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,910
Roger, "Air Force One. " Wind is
0- niner-0 at 1-2. You are clear to land.

281
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,811
They're landing.

282
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,508
Get down! Now!

283
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,640
Open the door!

284
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,445
Open!
Open the door!

285
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,824
No matter what happens, we land
this aircraft. Is that understood?

286
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,620
Come on. Flaps 30.

287
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:20,497
Flaps 30.

288
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:31,898
If we land, we're finished.

289
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,947
- No!
- Get the fuck in the air!

290
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,163
Now!
Take this plane up!

291
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,625
Up! Up!

292
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,130
- Get us back in the air now!
- Artie!

293
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,217
Take it up!

294
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:16,220
Get this plane back in the air now
or you die.

295
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,057
Get up now!

296
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,838
No! Jesus!

297
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:59,114
Contact those F-15s.

298
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:02,284
I want them to keep "Air Force One"
in visual contact.

299
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,412
- What are our airborne scenarios?
- There are no airborne scenarios.

300
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:09,166
Then we'd better start generating them.
They better be good and better work.

301
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,210
How long can they stay up there
with the fuel they have?

302
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,754
- That's a question of airspeed, wind.
- Altitude.

303
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:17,466
We need an "Air Force One" pilot. Any
educated guesses where they might go?

304
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,719
- Iraq, Libya, Algeria.
- Those are guesses, but not educated.

305
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,096
Notify our allies.
We'll need secure airspace.

306
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,098
- Can we keep that under wraps?
- We'll do our best.

307
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,852
Try and relax, Kathryn.
I'm in charge here.

308
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,605
I don't know.
It seems to me they're in charge.

309
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,906
We're heading home.

310
00:29:45,307 --> 00:29:46,507
Let's get him.

311
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,999
- Don't hurt me.
- Go.

312
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,501
Go.

313
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,202
The president.

314
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:00,903
The president is no longer on board.

315
00:30:01,004 --> 00:30:03,004
He made it to the pod and escaped.

316
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:23,115
Moscow police found six members
of a Russian TV news crew murdered.

317
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,118
The same crew that was cleared
to fly on "Air Force One. "

318
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:28,954
Tell me it's not that easy.

319
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,748
No. You would have to generate
fake I.D., photos.

320
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:34,084
- Fingerprints.
- Could be with help from Moscow.

321
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,919
How would they get weapons on board?

322
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,755
There's no way to get weapons on board
"Air Force One. " It's impossible.

323
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,259
There are enough weapons on board to
take Panama, but who has access to them?

324
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,094
You think someone on the plane
helped them?

325
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,847
What if somebody did
and they're still on the plane?

326
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,975
Who do they trust up there?
Who do we trust?

327
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:55,189
Madam Vice President,
Mr. Secretary.

328
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,608
All compromised nuclear launch codes
have been cancelled.

329
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,651
New codes are active.

330
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:04,114
Ramstein, the president's escape pod
has been located.

331
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:06,700
We're honing in at 2-8-5 degrees.

332
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:14,082
There it is.
Ramstein, we have a strong signal.

333
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,669
ETA, two minutes.

334
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,889
Where is the wife and daughter?

335
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,570
Where is my husband?

336
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:49,785
He had fled.
The coward chose to save himself.

337
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:55,999
But one can always
strike a bargain.

338
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,628
You listen to me.

339
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,090
I don't know who you are
or what you want...

340
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,717
but you will never get it.

341
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:09,137
He will not negotiate.

342
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,349
Really?

343
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:16,186
His wife. His daughter.

344
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:20,607
A man could not live with himself.

345
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,778
And it would be such bad politics.

346
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,620
I think he'll negotiate.

347
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,718
The escape pod is visually acquired.

348
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,888
Location of Ramstein is 2-8-4 degrees.

349
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:52,973
Twelve miles out.

350
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:48,174
All the weapons have been collected.

351
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:50,675
Nevsky, check the plane again.

352
00:33:50,776 --> 00:33:51,776
You have the first watch.

353
00:34:07,077 --> 00:34:09,777
I'll check downstairs.

354
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:23,178
Ready.

355
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:53,260
It's "Air Force One. "
They want to talk to the vice president.

356
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,398
Hello. Can you hear me?

357
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,695
This is the vice president
of the United States.

358
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,781
To whom am I speaking?

359
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:17,868
This is the person who controls
"Air Force One. "

360
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,538
The world's most secure aircraft.

361
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,042
What is it that you want?

362
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,794
We'll get to that.

363
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,633
- I want to speak to the First Lady.
- No.

364
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:36,428
- No. Why?
- I need to know they're safe.

365
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,223
The president is safe.

366
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,391
But then you must know that.

367
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:45,103
He ran from here like a whipped dog.

368
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:48,398
I'm sure you can't wait for him
to get back to making the decisions...

369
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,403
so you can stop sweating
through that silk blouse of yours.

370
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:00,410
What is the condition
of the people on board?

371
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,162
Some are dead.

372
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,749
What are your intentions?

373
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:10,838
What arrogance to think
you could ever understand my intentions.

374
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:14,383
I want to understand
what it is that you want.

375
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,426
What do I want?

376
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:22,140
When Mother Russia becomes
one great nation again...

377
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:26,770
when the capitalists are dragged
from the Kremlin...

378
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,773
and shot in the street...

379
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,821
when our enemies run and hide in fear
at the mention of our name...

380
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:40,534
and America begs our forgiveness...

381
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:45,038
on that great day of deliverance...

382
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,541
you will know what I want.

383
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,712
We can give you a forum
for your grievances.

384
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:54,131
We can contact the Russian government.

385
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,842
But you must understand
that it will take some time.

386
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,970
Really?
When you talk to the president...

387
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:04,224
you might remind him that I am holding
his wife, his daughter...

388
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,935
his chief of staff,
his national security advisor...

389
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:10,772
his classified papers
and his baseball glove.

390
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:17,237
If he wants them back, he will prevail
upon the puppet regime in Moscow...

391
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:20,407
to release General Radek.

392
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:22,451
Fifty for one.

393
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:25,162
It's a good deal.

394
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:26,663
How's your blouse?

395
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:33,462
What assurances do I have
that you'll keep your word?

396
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:37,174
I'll wait for confirmation that
General Radek has been released.

397
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:39,968
Until then...

398
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,015
I will execute a hostage
every half an hour.

399
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,770
You have my word.

400
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:55,776
You must understand that we...
Hello?

401
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,319
They're off!

402
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,825
Damn it!
Nobody does this...

403
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:04,827
to the United States.

404
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:08,413
The president will get back his glove
and play catch with this guy's balls.

405
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,333
We can't do anything in half an hour.
We need more time.

406
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,837
He's a zealot. Tough to negotiate with.
All you can do is wear them down.

407
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,338
Mr. Secretary!

408
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,516
We found the escape pod.

409
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,101
It's empty.

410
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,274
So where's the president?

411
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:42,072
I think we have to acknowledge
the possibility...

412
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:45,826
that the president
may be dead.

413
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,205
Why wouldn't they tell us?

414
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:56,044
Diversion.
Try to buy some time.

415
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,755
It could have happened in a cross fire,
and they're afraid we'll retaliate.

416
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:02,259
Damn right, we'll retaliate.
We'll release Radek into the atmosphere.

417
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:06,388
It doesn't add up. That terrorist knew
we'd recover the pod in short order.

418
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:08,557
He expected that we'd be talking
to Marshall.

419
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,186
Let's not bury him yet.
He could still be alive in that plane.

420
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,938
Let's not forget this president
is a Medal of Honor winner.

421
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:18,775
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter
missions than any man in my command.

422
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,777
He knows how to fight.

423
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,280
Then he's taking a terrible chance
with his life.

424
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:27,034
The element of surprise
is a formidable advantage in combat.

425
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:30,037
If he's up there,
he's the best chance that we have.

426
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,623
That pod was designed
for a reason, General.

427
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:35,626
He has no right to take chances
with his life.

428
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:53,227
Everything is all right.

429
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:42,419
What does the psych profile say?
How far will he go?

430
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:46,423
He's a Radek loyalist. That tells us
all we need to know, doesn't it?

431
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,551
He'll see this thing through
to the last hostage or his own death.

432
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:52,429
Release this bastard
and Central Asia will go up in flames!

433
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,722
I'm aware of that.

434
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:57,184
Bring back the old Soviet empire
under a flag of genocide?

435
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,353
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

436
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,564
I hate to say this,
but 50 people...

437
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:05,400
is a small price to pay
to stop that from happening.

438
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,110
Even if one of them is the president?

439
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,572
The presidency is bigger than any man.
Didn't they teach you that at Yale?

440
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:14,076
Can't we release him today
and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

441
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,786
We caught him before,
we'll catch him again.

442
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:18,330
If Petrov releases Radek,
his government will fall.

443
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,667
I promise you that.
Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

444
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,002
You go to catch him again,
you'll find him in Moscow.

445
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:28,924
With respect, Mr. Secretary, we don't
need more dramatics, we need options.

446
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:30,926
- It's not an option.
- We need a decision.

447
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:32,845
It's not her decision.

448
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,514
This is a military situation.
I'm the secretary of defense.

449
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,434
Check your regs. In the absence
of the president, the buck stops here.

450
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:41,603
Get the attorney general
with a copy of the Constitution.

451
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:44,940
We have... Oh, my God!
Nineteen minutes.

452
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:49,027
I'm going to consult
with President Petrov.

453
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:08,954
Madam Vice President, I'm sorry.
I cannot release him.

454
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,497
We would train...

455
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:13,542
all our military might
against this one target.

456
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,669
- He wouldn't stay at large for long.
- Maybe so.

457
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,088
But millions of lives
are hanging in the balance.

458
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,090
I am trying to save a nation!

459
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:21,592
As am I.

460
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:25,596
No nation can survive the loss,
nor soon replace, a great leader.

461
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:28,599
Let us be pragmatic.
Fifty lives means nothing...

462
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,100
in the grand scheme.

463
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,894
Let me be equally pragmatic.

464
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,563
Our president took a great risk
to come to your aid...

465
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:37,399
against strong opposition
in both parties and among our allies.

466
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,776
It would be politically impossible
to do so again.

467
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,905
If it meant saving his life,
I would gladly do it.

468
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,948
But I would have to know for sure.

469
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:47,367
And you cannot tell me he's alive,
can you?

470
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:50,454
No, Mr. President, I cannot.

471
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:54,791
Then there is nothing I can do.
I am truly sorry. Good-bye.

472
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:00,380
Okay, Walter,
you and your generals get to work.

473
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:24,309
He was in Afghanistan with me
for five years.

474
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,110
Find out who killed him
or you lie down next to him.

475
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,180
Okay, they can't keep the plane
in the air indefinitely.

476
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:52,683
There are only four possible
landing sites in Kazakhstan...

477
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:54,685
that are still controlled
by Radek's forces.

478
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:57,813
We have to go in and take all of them.
Can we do it?

479
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,898
I'd rather take my chances in the air.

480
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,442
I just looked at the airborne scenarios.
They're no good.

481
00:49:02,526 --> 00:49:06,446
- Can we do this?
- In the time we have? Messy.

482
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,074
Three more minutes
before they execute the first hostage.

483
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,118
You'll have to buy us more time.

484
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,619
All right.

485
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,020
It's time.

486
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:24,421
Transfer the phone
to the conference room.

487
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:52,409
You both, come here.

488
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:57,706
Now!

489
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,599
They will transfer the call here.

490
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,228
So...

491
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:22,064
let's just wait.

492
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,196
Excuse me.

493
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:35,077
Sir, if you will permit me,
I am the national security advisor.

494
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,079
I'm the man the president
would be listening to.

495
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,374
I believe you are negotiating right now
with the vice president.

496
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:44,127
In our system, the vice president
is like the queen of England.

497
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,421
She can't even get airline tickets
without talking...

498
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:50,384
to somebody like me; therefore,
let me speak to the White House.

499
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:54,638
I promise you, I'm the one person
who can make this all work out.

500
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:02,688
Has he been released?

501
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:06,984
I've contacted the Russian government.
We've set things in motion.

502
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,153
But at this point,
we have to be realistic.

503
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,196
It's going to take more time.

504
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:13,657
More time?

505
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:23,250
Your national security advisor
has just been executed.

506
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,836
He's a very good negotiator.

507
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:29,339
He bought you another half hour.

508
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,185
Mrs. Marshall.

509
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:44,062
Alice.

510
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:47,274
If you please, come with me.

511
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:28,398
That's the first time
you ever seen a man killed, huh?

512
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,400
Leave her alone.

513
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,696
You think I'm a monster?

514
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,824
That I would kill this man?

515
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:39,368
Somebody's son?

516
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,871
Somebody's father?

517
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,708
I am somebody's son, too.

518
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,546
I have three small children.

519
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,924
Does that surprise you?

520
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,930
- Tell her to answer.
- Leave her alone!

521
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:01,223
Shut up!

522
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,772
Why did you kill him?

523
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,817
Because I believe.

524
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:17,739
And when I shoot this man,
I know in that instant...

525
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:20,951
how deep was my belief.

526
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:24,163
That I would turn my back
on God Himself...

527
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,375
for Mother Russia.

528
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:31,336
My doubts, my fears.

529
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,131
My own private morality.

530
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:38,844
It dissolve in this moment...

531
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,430
for this love.

532
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:47,269
You know, your father,
he has also killed.

533
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:51,607
- Is he a bad man?
- That's not true.

534
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,609
Why?

535
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:58,989
Because he does it in a tuxedo
with a telephone call and a smart bomb?

536
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:03,118
You are a monster.

537
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:05,662
And my father is a great man.

538
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,416
You're nothing like my father.

539
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,238
What's the goddamn number?

540
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:48,413
- What city please?
- Washington D.C., the White House.

541
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,042
- Just a moment. Here's the number.
- Can you connect me to that number?

542
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,670
- There's a connect fee of one dollar.
- Fine.

543
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:12,146
White House switchboard.
How may I direct your call?

544
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,691
All right, listen.
Listen carefully.

545
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:19,027
This is an emergency call from
"Air Force One. " This is the president.

546
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,946
Connect me to the vice president.

547
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:22,865
Who did you say is calling?

548
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:29,496
- This is the president!
- Right, and I'm the First Lady.

549
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,540
Don't cut me off.
This is an emergency.

550
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:35,752
The president doesn't call this
particular number, so whoever you are...

551
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:38,005
Trace the call.

552
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,049
Follow your standard security procedure.

553
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,511
Trace the goddamn call!

554
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:48,682
Okay, sir. You want to make
a federal case out of this, fine by me!

555
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:59,902
Hello. Anyone there?

556
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:01,403
Don't move.

557
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,865
- I traced the call, sir.
- Give me the gun.

558
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:07,618
- Are you there?
- Slowly.

559
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,536
Oh, my God!

560
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,705
I'll put you right through,
Mr. President.

561
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:20,088
The switchboard has a call from someone
claiming to be the president.

562
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:23,217
She traced it back to
the White House satellite account.

563
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,385
The caller's gone,
but the line is still active.

564
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,429
Put it through.

565
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:30,098
Listen to me.

566
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:33,101
Listen to me.
You know who I am.

567
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:36,355
I'm the president of the United States.

568
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,065
- Yes!
- Quiet!

569
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:40,108
Don't think that means
I don't shoot you.

570
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:42,110
Put your hands behind your head
and move.

571
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,747
This is your lucky day.

572
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:56,792
What more can my people do?
Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

573
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,336
Even if they tried, we're equipped
with tactical countermeasures.

574
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:02,297
- He's talking to us.
- What do you mean?

575
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:05,801
I just want you to feel secure.
That way no one will get hurt.

576
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:08,512
The computer will fly circles
around any missile they fire at us.

577
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:11,557
- And no hit, just a shock wave.
- He's telling us what to do.

578
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,810
Believe me, all that would happen
is that we'd get knocked off our feet.

579
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:16,562
- That's all!
- Shut up!

580
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:21,066
My God! Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

581
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:23,318
- If we're going to act, we must act now.
- It's too risky.

582
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,487
The president is up there
with a gun to his head.

583
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,240
He's asking us to do that
to "Air Force One"?

584
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:29,908
He's not asking.

585
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:33,829
Your commander in chief has issued
a direct order. Do it!

586
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:41,211
Are you sure that's what
you want me to do?

587
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:44,923
You heard me. Let's pray it works
the way it's supposed to.

588
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:46,967
Boys, give me room.

589
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,512
I've been ordered to fire
on "Air Force One. "

590
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:06,570
I'm in position.
Missiles are armed.

591
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:12,993
The target is acquired.
I have a good lock.

592
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:17,080
God, I hope this works.
Fox Three.

593
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:42,481
What's going on?

594
00:58:43,382 --> 00:58:46,382
The Americans fired at us.
I have no control.

595
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,483
The computer is flying.

596
00:59:07,284 --> 00:59:09,784
Are they crazy?

597
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,158
This is Marshall.

598
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:19,495
- Anyone there?
- We're here, Mr. President.

599
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,371
Where's my family?
Are they safe?

600
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:23,957
The terrorists claim they're
holding them. We can't confirm.

601
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,417
Who are they?

602
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:27,753
What do they want?

603
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,297
They're Russian ultranationalist
radicals. They want General Radek...

604
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,466
...released from prison.
- Radek?

605
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,595
- What are our tactical options?
- We're working on that, Mr. President

606
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,682
- But the bastards have us in a corner.
- There is no rescue attempt?

607
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:44,186
I ruled out a midair rescue. We can
do nothing while the plane's in the air.

608
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:47,689
We gotta get this plane on the ground.
Take me off the speakerphone.

609
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:50,651
- Where's Bennett?
- Mr. President.

610
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,778
We cannot release Radek.

611
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:56,365
They're gonna shoot a hostage
every half hour until we do.

612
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,575
I don't want a plane
full of dead people.

613
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:02,329
Jim, they shot Jack Doherty.

614
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:05,666
Oh Christ!

615
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,711
We can't give in to their demands.
It won't end there.

616
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,297
If you die in the plane,
does it end there?

617
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:15,676
Kathryn, we've got a job to do...
whatever the cost.

618
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:17,719
- Mr. President, I-
- Kathryn...

619
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:23,433
...if you give a mouse a cookie-

620
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,311
He'll want a glass of milk.

621
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,357
We gotta get this plane
on the ground.

622
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,258
- Has Bazylev returned?
- No.

623
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,628
Get the plane on the ground.

624
01:02:52,529 --> 01:02:55,729
This man down there evades us.

625
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,830
My patience is running out.

626
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:57,629
I thought I'd ask you
to come and join us.

627
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:01,175
It is starting to feel
a little empty up here.

628
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:05,429
Sit down. Please.

629
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:13,896
Come.

630
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:31,705
Tell me your name again...

631
01:04:31,788 --> 01:04:34,249
for the record.

632
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,001
Melanie.

633
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,712
Melanie Mitchell.

634
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:42,174
You travel often...

635
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,676
with the President?

636
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,969
Yes.

637
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:50,140
So you know everyone on the plane?

638
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:53,393
Yes.

639
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,272
I bet they like you, huh?

640
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:00,651
You're a nice person, yes?

641
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,206
I guess so.

642
01:05:24,441 --> 01:05:27,444
You are trembling.

643
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:29,805
Why are you afraid?

644
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:34,810
Because I don't wanna die.

645
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:40,232
Tell me...

646
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:43,694
what am I doing at this moment?

647
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,698
You're pointing a gun at me.

648
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,284
Thank you, Melanie.

649
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:54,913
This is to the secret service agent
in the baggage deck.

650
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,417
I will count to ten.

651
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,379
And if you do not surrender,
this nice woman will die.

652
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:05,883
One.

653
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,051
- Please don't.
- Two.

654
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:11,305
- Don't do this!
- Three.

655
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,099
- Let me talk to him!
- Four.

656
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:15,809
- I beg you, please.
- Five.

657
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,061
Let me talk to the agent.

658
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:20,397
- Six.
- He might listen to me.

659
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:22,691
Seven.

660
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:24,985
- I beg you, don't do this.
- Eight.

661
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,614
- Don't do this, please!
- Nine!

662
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:43,295
Oh, God.

663
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:52,387
Let's think about that one
for a moment.

664
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:56,183
And then we'll start again.

665
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:58,352
Next time...

666
01:06:58,477 --> 01:07:01,063
I'll choose someone
more important.

667
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:24,169
I know what you are thinking,
First Lady.

668
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:26,964
You want me dead.

669
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:30,634
It may come to that.
In a war, people die.

670
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,719
This isn't war!

671
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,515
You just murdered
an unarmed woman.

672
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:40,978
You, who murdered 100,000 Iraqis
to save a nickel on a gallon of gas...

673
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:44,231
are going to lecture me
about the rules of war?

674
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:45,524
Don't!

675
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,279
Mr. President,
how can I help you?

676
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,574
Chief, you can help me
dump some fuel.

677
01:07:53,657 --> 01:07:56,034
Who's down there in the baggage deck?

678
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:59,037
- It's a secret service agent. Who?
- We have no idea.

679
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,748
Melanie was shot because one of your men
wouldn't show himself.

680
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:04,084
- I want to know who he is.
- We'd like to know ourselves.

681
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:07,171
Sir, it's someone
smart enough to know...

682
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:09,673
if you're hunting with one bullet,
you wait for a clean shot.

683
01:08:09,756 --> 01:08:11,925
What are you saying?

684
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:15,637
Whoever that is down there,
he may be our only hope.

685
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:19,933
Our only hope is that Washington
complies with this bastard.

686
01:08:19,975 --> 01:08:22,811
Because any minute now
another one of us is dead.

687
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,023
And you know what?

688
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:29,860
I'm afraid it might be me.

689
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,658
- Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?
- I see it.

690
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,953
Pop it open. There should be
a red switch. Toggle it up.

691
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:42,247
Hang on.

692
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:46,335
We got some indicator lights here.

693
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,421
To dump the fuel, you have to close
the circuit for the pump.

694
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:52,633
There's no switch,
so you'll have to cross the wires.

695
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:55,969
- Open the fuel control door.
- Hang on.

696
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:00,098
There should be five of them.

697
01:09:00,224 --> 01:09:02,851
- Do you see them, sir?
- I see them. Yeah.

698
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:06,730
Jesus. There's a lot of goddamn wires.
All right, wait a second.

699
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:08,273
We got five.

700
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,485
Green, yellow, red, white and blue.

701
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:13,028
Let me double-check.

702
01:09:13,195 --> 01:09:15,197
Come on. For Christ's sake, hurry up.

703
01:09:15,322 --> 01:09:18,033
Get the wrong wire, you'll cut
the engine feeds. The plane will crash.

704
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,286
Then we don't want to get
the wrong wire, do we?

705
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:22,996
Cut the green wire.

706
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:28,752
Cut.

707
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:34,049
- Then, cross the... With the...
- With the what?

708
01:09:34,216 --> 01:09:37,553
Hello? Cross it with the what?
Say again.

709
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:40,806
Cross the green wire with the...

710
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:46,353
For Christ's sake!

711
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:49,148
Wait, green...

712
01:09:49,273 --> 01:09:50,732
yellow...

713
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,902
red, white and blue.

714
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:58,073
I'm counting on you,
red, white and blue.

715
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,512
Sirs, it looks like "Air Force One"
is losing fuel.

716
01:10:23,913 --> 01:10:26,313
We're losing fuel.

717
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:29,714
Somebody is pumping it out of avionics.

718
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:39,015
I'm going downstairs.

719
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,416
Take Sergei.

720
01:10:50,317 --> 01:10:52,817
If it isn't us coming out, shoot.

721
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,918
A magazine, quickly.

722
01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:38,519
Are you okay?

723
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,220
Sergei? Kolchak?
What's happening?

724
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:52,621
He's dead. Give us a hand.

725
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:08,787
Madam Vice President, the time has come
for you to demonstrate your good faith.

726
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:11,248
I've been reading through
your press kit.

727
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:16,628
I understand "Air Force One"
is able to refuel in midair.

728
01:12:17,838 --> 01:12:20,549
We need fuel.
And we need it now.

729
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,678
I'm sure we can come
to some sort of arrangement.

730
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:28,265
If you'll land the plane,
we'll trade fuel for hostages.

731
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,392
This is bullshit!

732
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:34,980
It's simple physics. Without fuel,
the plane crashes. Everybody dies.

733
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,316
We're trying to do everything
that we can.

734
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:41,695
Tell me what I want to hear, or I will
execute a member of the senior staff...

735
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:45,741
and continue killing one hostage
every minute...

736
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:49,745
until the plane crash
or refueling plane arrive!

737
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:56,043
What do you say?

738
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,963
Fuel's on its way.

739
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:01,548
Thank you.

740
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:07,449
They'll refuel us.

741
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:12,850
Ready.

742
01:13:24,951 --> 01:13:26,851
Everything all right?

743
01:13:26,852 --> 01:13:28,452
Yes.

744
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,709
Move.

745
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,147
- Jim, what are you doing here?
- I never left.

746
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:06,238
Watch the door.

747
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:07,865
Where's my family?

748
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,159
Another part of the plane.
We haven't seen them.

749
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:12,411
We got weapons now.
We should try to retake the plane.

750
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:14,746
Not while they've got Grace and Alice.
I can't take that chance.

751
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,958
What about trying to disable the plane
and force them to land?

752
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:21,795
I tried. I dumped some fuel.
Now they're gonna refuel us in midair.

753
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,841
A refueling tanker?
Jesus! Sir?

754
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:30,345
- There may be a way to get people off.
- What do you mean?

755
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:33,640
We have emergency parachutes
in the tail cone, but we're too high.

756
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:36,685
If we could get a message
to the refueling tanker...

757
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:38,896
get him to drop to 15,000 feet,
we could jump.

758
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:41,982
They've disabled the phones.
They control the radios.

759
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:47,362
- Mr. President? Sir? The fax machines.
- The phone lines are out.

760
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:51,658
No. Voice lines and faxes are on
two different systems of encryption.

761
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:54,286
If you disable one,
it'd be easy to overlook the other.

762
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:01,376
If this works, you get to be
postmaster general. Come with me.

763
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,420
- Get these people ready.
- Yes. Remember.

764
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:07,633
15,000 feet and 200 knots.
Otherwise it's suicide.

765
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:09,843
You'll need this.

766
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:13,347
Good luck, people.

767
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,610
- Where are we sending it?
- Situation Room.

768
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:30,072
It makes me so proud
that you stuck with us.

769
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:34,201
- Thanks.
- Whatever happens.

770
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,815
Yes!

771
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:26,253
Madam Vice President,
the attorney general is here.

772
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:34,094
- Thank you for coming, Andrew.
- Good that you're here.

773
01:16:34,178 --> 01:16:38,307
You want my interpretation of what the
Constitution says about the situation?

774
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:40,893
Yes. Andrew,
my understanding is...

775
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:44,104
that if the president is out of contact
in a military situation...

776
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:46,940
the secretary of defense
is in charge as second in command.

777
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:49,568
- Yes, of course.
- Good. Then that settles it.

778
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:51,653
It doesn't settle it at all.

779
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:55,991
The president is not merely out
of contact. He is also under duress.

780
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:59,620
His family is held hostage,
possibly himself a hostage.

781
01:16:59,745 --> 01:17:04,583
It creates an incapacity to discharge
the office under the 25th amendment.

782
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,919
Surely just as if he'd had a stroke.

783
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:10,005
I think the president would dispute
that any incapacity exists.

784
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:15,093
It exists if a majority of the cabinet,
including yourself, says it exists.

785
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:19,139
The president may be alive,
but he may not be the president.

786
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,517
Madam Vice President?
I think you need to see this.

787
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:24,144
This is CNN breaking news.

788
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:29,900
We interrupt programming to bring you
this breaking news bulletin.

789
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:33,153
CNN has received
unconfirmed reports...

790
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:35,781
that "Air Force One" has crashed.

791
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,408
- Oh, my God! How did they get that?
- I don't know.

792
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:41,954
The aircraft was en route from Moscow
when it began its Mayday hail.

793
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,331
I repeat.
We have unconfirmed reports...

794
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:46,375
Call the press room.
We have to issue a statement.

795
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:49,294
that the president's plane
has crashed in Eastern Europe.

796
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:24,246
- Has "Air Force One" crashed?
- That is a rumor.

797
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:27,916
- Where'd the story come from?
- I don't know where it came from.

798
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,044
Listen.
I cannot confirm anything...

799
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,130
at this point.

800
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:41,430
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a statement.

801
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:48,520
The president's plane,
"Air Force One," has been hijacked.

802
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:52,983
Please.

803
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:56,069
Ladies and gentlemen,
please let me finish.

804
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:58,697
For security reasons,
I cannot divulge...

805
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:02,284
the identity of the hijackers
or who was on board the plane.

806
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:05,871
But I'm here to assure
the American people...

807
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:09,166
that we are doing everything we can
to resolve the situation.

808
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:13,837
For the safety of all the people
on the plane...

809
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:17,216
I cannot tell you any more than I have,
and I'm sure you understand that.

810
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:19,092
Is James Marshall still the president?

811
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:22,679
I'm coordinating with
the National Security Council...

812
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:24,890
pending the president's return.

813
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:26,975
And, yes, James Marshall
is still the president.

814
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:31,605
At this time...

815
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:36,151
At this time,
I would like to ask all Americans...

816
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:43,659
to pray for the safety of everyone
on board "Air Force One. "

817
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,744
Thank you.

818
01:19:48,831 --> 01:19:50,290
The president.

819
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:00,968
Where is the president?

820
01:20:08,769 --> 01:20:11,069
Everything all right down there?

821
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:15,570
Yes.

822
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:47,181
Folks, listen up.
This is your main rip cord.

823
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:49,391
As soon as you clear the plane,
give it a yank.

824
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:52,478
If your chute doesn't open,
this is your reserve chute.

825
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:54,188
Pull it down. Clear?

826
01:21:16,919 --> 01:21:20,130
"Air Force One," do you read?

827
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:23,217
Yes, we read. Go ahead.

828
01:21:23,258 --> 01:21:26,136
"Air Force One,"
this is "Extender 1-0."

829
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,556
- We have been instructed to refuel you.
- Go ahead.

830
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:34,061
Drop to 15,000 feet
and slow to 200 knots.

831
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,772
Acknowledged. Two hundred.

832
01:21:40,526 --> 01:21:43,612
- They got it!
- They got the fax.

833
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:46,156
Sir, your chute.

834
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,992
- Please, sir.
- I'm not leaving without my family.

835
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:53,831
Okay, "Air Force One,"
you need to open your receptacle door.

836
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:56,875
Pull the yellow lever
on the upper control panel.

837
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:58,961
Done.

838
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,755
Go ahead and close distance
nice and easy.

839
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,969
Almost there.

840
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:12,474
- Where are your chutes?
- We stay with the president, sir.

841
01:22:14,685 --> 01:22:15,811
Thank you.

842
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:25,696
All right, that's close enough.
Here we go!

843
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,163
Go! Go!

844
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:36,832
Go! Come on!

845
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:39,433
Go check. Do it!

846
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:42,838
Go! You, come on!

847
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:53,539
The hostages are gone!

848
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,209
We got...

849
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:23,795
so far 25 chutes.

850
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:48,946
- I can't hold her.
- What are you doing?

851
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,573
Break away! Break away!

852
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:00,624
Sir, take my hand!

853
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:16,223
Everybody, break now!

854
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:33,448
- Don't move!
- Let me save him!

855
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:36,869
He's the president,
for God's sake!

856
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:39,163
Go get him!

857
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:49,006
Grab my hand!

858
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:52,509
Major!

859
01:24:56,638 --> 01:24:58,599
I got you.

860
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,120
We have the president.

861
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:14,448
We've lost the tanker?
What else?

862
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:17,784
- They're counting 32 survivors.
- That means they still have hostages.

863
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,162
- What about the first family?
- No word yet.

864
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:22,414
Losing hostages will make
the terrorists more desperate.

865
01:25:22,498 --> 01:25:25,959
Madam Vice President,
we've got "Air Force One" on the line.

866
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:29,838
This is Vice President Bennett.
We're listening.

867
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:31,882
I now hold hostage...

868
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:35,344
the president of the United States
of America.

869
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:40,474
Soon we shall enter
the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan.

870
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:45,813
You will cease your military escort
at the border.

871
01:25:46,814 --> 01:25:48,982
If you violate our airspace...

872
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:52,569
I will execute a member
of the first family.

873
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:55,989
Tell our fighters to back off.

874
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,327
Get me Ops.

875
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:06,959
You said a presidential incapacity
could be declared by a cabinet majority.

876
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:10,003
- Would you sign it?
- Under the circumstances.

877
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,131
See who else would.

878
01:26:21,056 --> 01:26:23,475
Move! Come on, move!

879
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:29,773
Fast! Move! Quick! Right here.

880
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:38,365
- It'll be all right.
- I know.

881
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:02,973
You've been very busy downstairs.

882
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:05,809
Haven't you?

883
01:27:06,894 --> 01:27:09,062
Killing my men.

884
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:31,627
You don't wanna do that.

885
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:36,173
I'm what you came for.
Don't forget that.

886
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:38,926
Then I kill them.

887
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:40,761
Or just one.

888
01:27:40,844 --> 01:27:42,930
You pick.

889
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:46,809
That's what you do in the White House.
You play God.

890
01:27:53,816 --> 01:27:56,151
Go ahead.

891
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:58,195
Which one lives?

892
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,032
Go ahead.

893
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:14,586
You're not here for this.
You want something.

894
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:18,715
- What is it?
- Radek.

895
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:22,761
- How can I do that? I can't.
- Then you die, the three of you.

896
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,430
I'll do anything to save my family.
Don't ask something I can't give!

897
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:29,643
The most powerful man on the earth.
Suddenly, there are things you can't do.

898
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:33,856
This is very curious.
Stop with your fucking lies!

899
01:28:44,575 --> 01:28:48,662
- Petrov will never give up Radek.
- Petrov is a dog.

900
01:28:48,787 --> 01:28:51,540
He does what you tell him.

901
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:57,212
Tell him to do this.

902
01:28:57,379 --> 01:29:02,468
Petrov used me.
I just wanted to stop the bloodshed.

903
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:05,721
He wanted a personal victory.
Petrov hates Radek.

904
01:29:05,846 --> 01:29:09,683
Of course he hates Radek.
Radek is everything he is not.

905
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:12,227
A great man, a strong man.

906
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:15,063
Are you saying...

907
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:17,191
he would refuse you?

908
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:21,945
You'd be playing right into his hands.
Are you an idiot?

909
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:26,867
You'd make him into a hero.
The man who stopped the terrorists.

910
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:29,786
Or better yet,
the man who stopped me.

911
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:33,832
You talk as if you have nothing
to do with this.

912
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:39,713
This is all your doing.

913
01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:42,591
This infection you call freedom.

914
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:45,010
Without meaning, without purpose.

915
01:29:45,928 --> 01:29:48,138
You have given my country...

916
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:50,724
to gangsters and prostitutes.

917
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:55,938
You have taken everything from us.

918
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:01,860
There is nothing left.

919
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:11,453
Call him.

920
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:19,419
No!

921
01:30:21,130 --> 01:30:22,631
No!

922
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:31,682
Sit!

923
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:33,976
- No.
- I have no choice.

924
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:39,022
- You have the choice.
- Leave her alone. It's between us.

925
01:30:39,148 --> 01:30:41,942
You lose a child,
it hollows you out.

926
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:43,986
We're soldiers.

927
01:30:44,987 --> 01:30:47,406
You take my life.

928
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:50,409
Have you no honor?

929
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:53,287
- I'll count to five.
- No!

930
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:55,539
- It's gonna be all right, honey.
- One.

931
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:57,916
- It's gonna be all right.
- Two.

932
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,669
I'll do it.

933
01:31:00,794 --> 01:31:02,212
Yes.

934
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:04,256
I'll do it.

935
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:10,679
You just leave my family alone.

936
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:20,063
Leave 'em alone.

937
01:31:38,586 --> 01:31:41,786
Sir, the president of the United States.

938
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:44,963
Mr. President!

939
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:49,551
We just got an intercept.

940
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,095
The president called Petrov
and asked him to release Radek.

941
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:55,808
- He can't do that!
- He must have no choice.

942
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:58,185
We have a choice.

943
01:31:58,268 --> 01:32:02,731
I have the signatures of the cabinet
attesting to the president's incapacity.

944
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:06,235
- Sign it and you can overrule him.
- No. I won't do that.

945
01:32:06,318 --> 01:32:09,947
The United States does not negotiate
with terrorists.

946
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:11,990
It's been our principle
for 25 years.

947
01:32:12,074 --> 01:32:14,243
You can't give in to them now.

948
01:32:14,368 --> 01:32:17,162
It'll be open season on
the United States. Many more will die.

949
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:24,336
Jim isn't making this decision as
president, but as a husband and father.

950
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,342
History will judge you
by what you do right now.

951
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:32,469
For God's sake, sign it.

952
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:08,899
You are released.

953
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:15,888
I can now confirm that General Radek
is in the process of being released.

954
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:19,391
I repeat. General Radek
is now being released.

955
01:33:40,996 --> 01:33:45,042
Yes, yes.
General Radek has been released.

956
01:33:49,713 --> 01:33:51,590
It is confirmed.

957
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,887
They are releasing the general.

958
01:33:57,846 --> 01:33:59,264
Now what?

959
01:33:59,348 --> 01:34:02,309
Now we return to our homeland...

960
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:05,312
where Radek will decide
how best to use you...

961
01:34:05,354 --> 01:34:07,439
now that we know you are willing...

962
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:09,191
to negotiate.

963
01:34:10,526 --> 01:34:12,986
Our nation needs so many things.

964
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:17,115
- You said you were gonna release us.
- Forgive me. I lied.

965
01:34:59,992 --> 01:35:01,410
Listen.

966
01:36:37,965 --> 01:36:40,259
- Sir, are you hit?
- Stay with the major, honey.

967
01:36:40,342 --> 01:36:43,137
- Alice, get in the cockpit.
- Lie down.

968
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:16,795
- Let her go!
- Not until Radek is safely away.

969
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,716
Call it off.
Don't give up Radek.

970
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:24,928
If anything happens to the general,
your wife will die!

971
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:33,549
Comrades.

972
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,850
Our forces have arrived
for the general.

973
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:38,051
They'll pick him up any minute.

974
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,070
You hear that?
It's almost over, Mr. President.

975
01:38:16,271 --> 01:38:17,689
Drop the gun!

976
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:34,498
You made one mistake when
you killed my pilot, Mr. President.

977
01:38:34,623 --> 01:38:37,709
No one left to fly the plane.

978
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:43,590
And no parachute.

979
01:38:45,384 --> 01:38:47,845
Whatever happens...

980
01:38:49,263 --> 01:38:51,890
you lose and I win.

981
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,238
Get off my plane!

982
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:11,218
- You all right?
- They're leading the general to the courtyard.

983
01:40:12,888 --> 01:40:14,264
Go.

984
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:16,975
Go! Call Petrov!

985
01:40:57,012 --> 01:41:00,012
Stop! Don't move.

986
01:41:19,413 --> 01:41:21,290
They killed him.

987
01:41:21,415 --> 01:41:22,958
Mr. President.

988
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:35,637
He almost got away.
Did you hear me? Radek is dead.

989
01:41:35,762 --> 01:41:39,016
Yes! It's the president.
We have retaken the plane!

990
01:41:48,901 --> 01:41:51,904
- How's he doing?
- Not good, sir.

991
01:41:52,988 --> 01:41:55,616
- I don't suppose you know how to fly.
- No, sir.

992
01:41:55,699 --> 01:41:58,243
- Come along. I'll need a copilot.
- Yes, sir.

993
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:02,122
How long since you've flown, sir?

994
01:42:02,247 --> 01:42:07,044
Twenty-five years.
Little planes. Never jets.

995
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:09,797
Nothing like this.

996
01:42:09,922 --> 01:42:12,049
- Anybody there?
- Yes, we're here, sir.

997
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:14,218
You got somebody
that can help me fly this?

998
01:42:14,343 --> 01:42:18,138
Sir, this is Colonel Jackson. We need
to get you out of hostile territory.

999
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:21,975
- Good idea, Bob.
- Look above the central video screen.

1000
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:26,355
There's a series of L.E.D. numbers.
One of them should read 1-1-0.

1001
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,857
- Got it.
- That's your course heading.

1002
01:42:28,982 --> 01:42:32,402
Just below, there's a knob
surrounded by hash marks.

1003
01:42:32,528 --> 01:42:36,114
Turn that knob counterclockwise
to 290.

1004
01:42:37,866 --> 01:42:39,576
- We're turning, Bob.
- Good.

1005
01:42:43,413 --> 01:42:45,624
- This will take you out of Kazakhstan.
- We're gonna be okay.

1006
01:42:46,625 --> 01:42:50,671
Now, we can't land this plane on autopilot,
so we'll need to go over a few things.

1007
01:42:52,381 --> 01:42:54,883
Where's the nearest safe landing site?

1008
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:57,678
Incirlik, Turkey.

1009
01:42:57,803 --> 01:42:59,680
- General Northwood.
- Madam?

1010
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:02,307
What's that?

1011
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:05,686
Madam Vice President,
that red dot represents MiGs.

1012
01:43:05,769 --> 01:43:07,479
On course to intercept "Air Force One".

1013
01:43:07,563 --> 01:43:09,898
Christ! They took off from Aktubinsk.

1014
01:43:09,982 --> 01:43:12,860
The base commander there
is loyal to Radek.

1015
01:43:12,943 --> 01:43:16,864
General, send our fighters
into Kazakhstan.

1016
01:43:16,947 --> 01:43:20,284
Order them to use any and all means
to protect the president.

1017
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:23,620
When you're on final approach,
keep the throttles mid-range.

1018
01:43:23,745 --> 01:43:25,914
- Mr. President, can you hear me?
- Yes, Kathryn.

1019
01:43:25,998 --> 01:43:29,042
We're tracking six MiGs closing
on your position. I'm sending in...

1020
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:31,086
our F-15s to protect you.

1021
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,380
- Shit!
- Did she say MiGs?

1022
01:43:33,464 --> 01:43:35,924
Yes, she said MiGs.

1023
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:38,969
Get in that seat and put a seat belt on.
We're having trouble.

1024
01:43:41,638 --> 01:43:45,476
These MiGs get closer,
I'm gonna have to maneuver this thing.

1025
01:43:45,601 --> 01:43:47,561
How do I get it off autopilot?

1026
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:50,814
Push the button on the yoke
by your left thumb.

1027
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:53,317
I'll try a little right turn.

1028
01:43:53,442 --> 01:43:55,944
Keep your moves smooth and steady.
It's all flying.

1029
01:43:56,028 --> 01:43:59,281
Just step on the ball.

1030
01:43:59,406 --> 01:44:01,533
That's right.
Just like riding a bike.

1031
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:05,829
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit,
bearing 0-9-0.

1032
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:07,998
Jettison tanks and push it up.

1033
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,798
These MiGs, how far away are they?

1034
01:44:18,634 --> 01:44:20,010
Never mind.

1035
01:44:38,612 --> 01:44:42,658
- One coming. Countermeasures activated.
- Left turn.

1036
01:44:46,912 --> 01:44:48,413
Jesus Christ!

1037
01:44:48,497 --> 01:44:51,583
- We need some help.
- U.S. fighters, this is "Air Force One. "

1038
01:44:51,667 --> 01:44:53,377
We are under attack.
Where are you?

1039
01:44:53,502 --> 01:44:57,923
This is Halo Flight closing
on your position. E. T.A. two minutes.

1040
01:44:58,006 --> 01:44:59,675
We may not be here!

1041
01:45:07,683 --> 01:45:08,600
We're hit!

1042
01:45:10,185 --> 01:45:13,772
Christ. We're on fire.
We've got an engine on fire.

1043
01:45:13,856 --> 01:45:16,942
- Number four engine is on fire.
- Pull the fire handle overhead.

1044
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:18,986
I got it.

1045
01:45:21,864 --> 01:45:25,492
- We're rolling right.
- Left rudder. You have to compensate.

1046
01:45:25,576 --> 01:45:28,370
- Do I pull back on number one engine?
- Negative. You'll slow down.

1047
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:30,546
- Trim it out.
- How do I do that?

1048
01:45:30,581 --> 01:45:33,792
- Knob. Aft pedestal.
- Jesus Christ!

1049
01:45:33,876 --> 01:45:38,297
We got a red light.
Looks like we're losing fuel.

1050
01:45:40,048 --> 01:45:41,258
Halo Flight.

1051
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:43,552
Everybody lock a bandit.

1052
01:45:43,677 --> 01:45:45,846
Stand by for max range.

1053
01:45:45,929 --> 01:45:47,973
And Fox Three!

1054
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:06,575
Kill one!

1055
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:15,876
Kill two! Four more bandits
bearing 0-9-0. Halo Flight engage!

1056
01:46:18,962 --> 01:46:21,131
Ha, ha! Good guys are here.

1057
01:46:23,926 --> 01:46:27,137
- Bug out west. We'll cover you.
- You got it.

1058
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,601
- Sir, pull up! You got one on your tail.
- Get him off my tail!

1059
01:46:34,728 --> 01:46:35,896
Missile away.

1060
01:46:35,979 --> 01:46:40,192
- Break left and climb!
- Shit! Sir, we've lost countermeasures.

1061
01:46:41,652 --> 01:46:44,822
This is "Halo 2." They've lost
countermeasures. I'm going in.

1062
01:46:53,497 --> 01:46:55,707
Two's down! "Halo 2"is down!

1063
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:58,001
"Air Force One,"
are you still with us?

1064
01:46:58,127 --> 01:47:00,295
Yes! We're still here.

1065
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:08,470
Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

1066
01:47:17,146 --> 01:47:18,939
The last three MiGs
are bugging out, sir.

1067
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:21,942
- We're clear!
- Yes!

1068
01:47:23,986 --> 01:47:25,654
- Bob, are you still there?
- Yes, sir.

1069
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:29,366
Got a little problem here.
My rudder is sluggish.

1070
01:47:29,491 --> 01:47:30,993
Let me look.

1071
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,915
Oh, man!

1072
01:47:36,999 --> 01:47:39,209
Sir, you're torn up pretty bad.

1073
01:47:39,334 --> 01:47:41,962
Do you have any elevator control?

1074
01:47:42,004 --> 01:47:45,174
It's sluggish, too.
And we're still losing fuel.

1075
01:47:48,177 --> 01:47:52,347
We got a problem up here.
Sirs, "Air Force One" is badly hit.

1076
01:47:53,515 --> 01:47:57,352
With the damage,
there's no way they can land.

1077
01:48:00,814 --> 01:48:02,232
I'm sorry, sir.

1078
01:48:04,318 --> 01:48:07,696
- Thanks for your help.
- I'll stay on your wing, sir.

1079
01:48:07,821 --> 01:48:10,449
Take it straight and steady
until we figure out what to do.

1080
01:48:11,575 --> 01:48:12,784
Sir.

1081
01:48:15,037 --> 01:48:17,456
You did great.

1082
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:40,687
They can't control the plane. Engines
are failing and they're losing fuel.

1083
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:42,856
There must be something
we can do to help them.

1084
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:47,402
- Is that our airstrip strike team?
- Yeah. Why?

1085
01:48:47,486 --> 01:48:49,696
I just had a wild idea.

1086
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:52,616
Time is critical.
Start turning north.

1087
01:48:52,741 --> 01:48:55,828
- You'll get more details en route.
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:48:55,911 --> 01:48:58,205
Change of orders acknowledged.

1089
01:49:03,168 --> 01:49:08,966
Try to hold your heading, sir.
They'll rejoin in about 25 minutes.

1090
01:49:09,091 --> 01:49:10,259
All right.

1091
01:49:10,384 --> 01:49:12,386
- We know it's risky.
- Understood.

1092
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:15,013
But we are all out of options.

1093
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:18,892
Yeah, baby?

1094
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:22,312
It'll be okay.
Everything's gonna work.

1095
01:49:37,828 --> 01:49:40,205
Concerned Americans have gathered
at the White House...

1096
01:49:40,289 --> 01:49:42,708
to await word on the president
and his family.

1097
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:44,918
But CNN has learned
that "Air Force One"...

1098
01:49:45,002 --> 01:49:48,422
is severely crippled
and virtually unlandable.

1099
01:49:48,505 --> 01:49:51,758
Sources report that the first family
is still trapped on board.

1100
01:49:51,842 --> 01:49:55,888
And a daring midair rescue operation
is said to be underway.

1101
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,059
"Air Force One," this is "Liberty 2-4"
approaching on your left side.

1102
01:50:01,143 --> 01:50:03,645
- Do you read?
- "Air Force One. " Loud and clear.

1103
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:07,441
Gibbs, they're here.
Get the door.

1104
01:50:07,566 --> 01:50:11,236
- We'll need 10,000 feet and 200 knots.
- We've got to get her slowed down.

1105
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:16,909
"Air Force One" and "Liberty 2-4,"
this is "AWACS Blue Star. "

1106
01:50:16,992 --> 01:50:19,578
We have you in radar contact.

1107
01:50:31,799 --> 01:50:34,551
"Liberty 2-4,"
they're almost out of fuel.

1108
01:50:34,676 --> 01:50:36,094
Roger.

1109
01:50:36,178 --> 01:50:38,347
"Air Force One," keep the wings level.

1110
01:50:38,472 --> 01:50:42,267
If the engines fail, sacrifice altitude
to maintain airspeed.

1111
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:49,607
Ready!

1112
01:50:49,608 --> 01:50:52,820
"Liberty 2-4," ramp leader.
First man is on his way.

1113
01:50:52,861 --> 01:50:55,405
Back up. Easy.

1114
01:50:55,531 --> 01:50:58,784
"Air Force One," come left, six.

1115
01:51:02,496 --> 01:51:06,333
- How's my speed?
- It's good. See if you can hold it.

1116
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:10,087
A little more left, sir.
Three, two, stop.

1117
01:51:20,222 --> 01:51:22,432
Take my arm! Pull me in!

1118
01:51:24,393 --> 01:51:26,770
Come on! Come on!

1119
01:51:30,274 --> 01:51:33,235
- Unhook me.
- I got it.

1120
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,862
Good.

1121
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:40,409
"Liberty," locked in.
Where's the president?

1122
01:51:40,534 --> 01:51:42,703
Up in the cockpit.

1123
01:51:53,922 --> 01:51:57,634
- We lost another engine.
- "Liberty," we lost another engine.

1124
01:51:57,759 --> 01:51:59,178
"Liberty 2-4." Acknowledged.

1125
01:52:00,846 --> 01:52:02,347
Sir, time to go.

1126
01:52:02,431 --> 01:52:07,060
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- I'll take care of that, sir. Got it.

1127
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:08,729
Go!

1128
01:52:08,854 --> 01:52:11,482
Ramp to pilot.
Second P.J.'s on the way.

1129
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:24,912
- Mr. President, this way!
- My family first.

1130
01:52:24,995 --> 01:52:28,540
- Sir, I have orders to take you off.
- Them first.

1131
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:34,379
"Blue Star," the third parajumper
is boarding "Air Force One. "

1132
01:52:34,463 --> 01:52:37,925
- Standing by for recovery.
- Roger. Moving into receiver position.

1133
01:52:42,137 --> 01:52:45,140
- Dad?
- You'll be all right, honey.

1134
01:52:45,224 --> 01:52:47,559
- Promise?
- Promise.

1135
01:52:47,643 --> 01:52:49,478
Close your eyes.

1136
01:52:49,603 --> 01:52:52,064
You can do it.
Just hold on tight.

1137
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:55,943
It's okay. Don't worry.

1138
01:53:00,155 --> 01:53:01,365
She's okay.

1139
01:53:06,829 --> 01:53:10,124
- Hang on!
- Ramp to pilot. We got her!

1140
01:53:16,338 --> 01:53:18,340
I'm right behind you.

1141
01:53:30,310 --> 01:53:31,812
Come on there!

1142
01:53:32,187 --> 01:53:34,106
Hang on. Good.

1143
01:53:34,189 --> 01:53:37,860
- You're next, sir.
- Him next. He's wounded.

1144
01:53:37,985 --> 01:53:41,155
- You go.
- Come on, Shep. Come on, pal.

1145
01:53:47,202 --> 01:53:48,871
We've lost another engine.

1146
01:53:54,543 --> 01:53:58,964
You're sinking too fast. We only
have time for one more retrieval.

1147
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:04,261
We're passing 3,000 feet.
Impact in less than two minutes.

1148
01:54:04,386 --> 01:54:07,264
Get the president out of there!

1149
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:09,183
Right here.

1150
01:54:09,266 --> 01:54:11,810
Easy there.

1151
01:54:11,935 --> 01:54:13,729
He's on.

1152
01:54:13,896 --> 01:54:17,774
- Get your arms ready. It's time to go.
- What about the other team?

1153
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:21,570
There's no time.
I can only take one more.

1154
01:54:21,695 --> 01:54:23,572
No! We're all going!

1155
01:54:23,697 --> 01:54:27,534
That's impossible, sir.
I have to take you.

1156
01:54:27,659 --> 01:54:31,121
It's time to get you off this plane.
Go, sir.

1157
01:54:31,246 --> 01:54:32,790
Go!

1158
01:54:34,416 --> 01:54:36,210
Please go!

1159
01:54:45,677 --> 01:54:47,137
It was you?

1160
01:55:01,485 --> 01:55:04,655
- Give me the strap!
- I trusted you with my life.

1161
01:55:04,863 --> 01:55:07,866
So will the next president.
Now, give it to me.

1162
01:55:11,578 --> 01:55:14,706
We have to release the cable.
We're descending from 1200 feet.

1163
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:19,378
I'm getting off this plane!

1164
01:55:33,642 --> 01:55:34,977
Seven hundred!

1165
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:39,273
Five hundred!

1166
01:55:39,398 --> 01:55:41,358
We have to pull up!

1167
01:56:10,095 --> 01:56:12,890
"Blue Star. "
"Air Force One" is down.

1168
01:56:13,015 --> 01:56:15,601
I repeat.
"Air Force One" is down.

1169
01:56:15,684 --> 01:56:18,312
"Liberty 2-4,"
do you have the president?

1170
01:56:22,024 --> 01:56:24,067
Right. You can do it.

1171
01:56:27,696 --> 01:56:31,241
- "Liberty," do you have the president?
- Stand by.

1172
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:49,551
Hang on!

1173
01:56:49,676 --> 01:56:51,345
We got him!

1174
01:56:54,807 --> 01:56:58,685
"Liberty 2-4"is changing call signs.
"Liberty 2-4"is now...

1175
01:56:58,727 --> 01:57:00,479
"Air Force One"!

1176
01:57:09,738 --> 01:57:13,450
Mr. President, welcome aboard, sir.
