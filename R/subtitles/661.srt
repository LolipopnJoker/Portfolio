00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,944
Brad.

3
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,245
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

4
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,480
Bye-bye, guys.
I'll pick you up on Monday.

5
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,748
- Brad.
- What's up?

6
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,117
Hey, Brad.

7
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,222
Hey, Brad.
Looking good, buddy.

8
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,992
- Dylan, where's your retainer?
- I left it at Dad's.

9
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:34,492
Hey, where's your
math workbook?

10
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,528
At Mom's house.

11
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,796
- Where are all your undies?
- I don't know.

12
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,632
How do we got so many undies?

13
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,570
Happy birthday, buddy!

14
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,738
Brad already got me one.

15
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,676
It was my idea! It was my idea!

16
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,611
Hey, look at that.

17
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,878
Guys.

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,115
Daddy.

19
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,587
Oh!

20
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,791
Megan, hold up!

21
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,627
Whoa!

22
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,227
Ah!

23
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,564
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

24
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,538
Right here!
Don't leave without it.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,343
Come on!
Keep it moving!

26
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,544
Inside the cones!

27
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:28,583
Inside the cones like an ice cream.
Let's go!

28
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,216
Braddie!

29
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,918
Here you go, buddy.

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,585
Oh. Thanks, Braddie.

31
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,653
- Hot cocoa?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,420
Nice. Little marshmallows
floating around there

33
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,590
all in formation.
You are the greatest.

34
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,425
I put a little licorice root
in there, too.

35
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,693
- Oh!
- Tell me what you think.

36
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,995
- Hey, guys.
- Daddy!

37
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,532
- Hey. Hi, how was your day?
- Good.

38
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:47,932
All right,
guys, hop in.

39
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,801
I'll get them ready and I'll
meet you at Tae Kwon Do.

40
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,936
- See you in 30.
- Great. Looking forward to it.

41
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,405
- Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

42
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,274
Oh!

43
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,608
- Dusty.
- Yeah?

44
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,509
Sorry. You made treats for
tonight, right?

45
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,479
No, I got the gift card. I thought
you were on treats tonight.

46
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:04,182
No. I did gift card and the treats
for the Halloween Spooktacular.

47
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,717
Okay. Well,
I guess I'll hit the bakery

48
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,186
- on the way to the pageant.
- Bakery?

49
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,486
Unless you don't want me
to go to the bakery.

50
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,587
- No...
- Usually, when you repeat what I said

51
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,823
and you shake your head
up and down,

52
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,123
it really means
you don't want me to do it.

53
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,525
- I'm just thinking...
- What?

54
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,894
Maybe homemade?

55
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:17,530
Yeah. Hey! Honk at him again,
you better count your teeth!

56
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,397
No problem, Braddie.
Homemade snickerdoodles

57
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,799
coming right up.
One for you, too.

58
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,467
Should we fist bump again
or would it be awkward?

59
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,071
I don't mind a second bump.
All right.

60
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,339
Thanks, buddy.
See you tonight.

61
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,774
Bye, mate. Thanks so
much for the cocoa.

62
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:29,941
Bye, Daddy.

63
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,347
Sorry.

64
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,048
- Bye.
- Bye.

65
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,752
These look great.
Thank you.

66
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,551
- Look at that.
- Oh...

67
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,520
- Daddy! Karen!
- Hey! Hey, guys.

68
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,758
Wow, look how sexy
Karen looks.

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,325
Leather pants and side boob.

70
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,926
That's perfect
for a school function.

71
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,730
- Honey, let's expect good things, okay?
- I know, you're right. Right.

72
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,699
- Hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

73
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,702
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,069
Wow, look at you guys.

75
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,104
You and Mommy are
so sassy all the time.

76
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,272
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,309
Oh, hey. I got your novel.

78
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,645
- It's amazing.
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

79
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:08,281
I don't know how you write
such powerful dialogue.

80
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:10,147
- I mean, it must just come naturally, right?
- Aw.

81
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,018
- Like everything else.
- You're so sweet.

82
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,300
- Are you guys ready?
- Let's go.

83
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,920
I want my shirt
like Adrianna's.

84
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,489
Uh, no. No, no, no, honey.
We're not doing that, okay?

85
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,792
Put that back in.
Look like a nice kid.

86
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,063
<i>Welcome to

00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,034

and dressing up my dog
like a reindeer.

101
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,503
That's what
Christmas means to me.

102
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,705
Thank you.

103
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,743
And now we have Megan Mayron.

104
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,347
My name is Megan Mayron, and I
like Christmas presents a lot.

105
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,085
But I don't really
like Christmas.

106
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,287
My daddy was at my first
Christmases,

107
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:23,722
but I don't remember those ones.

108
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,260
Then we had some
with no daddy at all.

109
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,826
Then Brad came,

110
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,595
but he was always
trying way too hard

111
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,332
and making everyone feel
uncomfortable.

112
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,498
Then Daddy came back,

113
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,900
and Brad did a pretend Christmas

114
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,369
to show Daddy that Brad
was better than him.

115
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:42,340
So now we have to go to different
houses to have different Christmases.

116
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,075
Me and my brother wish
we were like other families

117
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,611
and we had normal Christmases.

118
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,580
But we still like
our Christmas presents.

119
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,982
I want to be very clear
about that.

120
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,183
Thank you very much.

121
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,388
Enjoy paying for therapy, boys!

122
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,989
You better shut your mouth,
Jerry!

123
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,224
Absolutely, Dusty.

124
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,929
We're messing up our kids,
Brad, and it's on you.

125
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,164
On me? Why is it on me?

126
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,034
Because before you came around
we only had one Christmas.

127
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,503
So it's on you.

128
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,470
Hold on, hold on. We don't
have to circle the wagons

129
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,039
every time one of the kids
expresses a negative emotion.

130
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,142
They're fine.

131
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:17,510
Kids that get up in front of
whole schools

132
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,477
and say they don't like
Christmas aren't fine, Sara.

133
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,914
Well, she said she didn't like
having two Christmases.

134
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,948
Which is on you.

135
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,150
So what if we all spend
a Christmas together?

136
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,219
A Together Christmas.
That's good.

137
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,722
Now you fixed it. See, that...

138
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,256
Now it's off of you.

139
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,890
Let's invite Adrianna's dad,
too.

140
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,924
- What?
- Yes.

141
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,126
- Are you being serious right now? No.
- Yeah.

142
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,061
Put that hand down.

143
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,431
I've been nothing but nice to that guy,
and he treats me like I abducted his kid.

144
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,666
I'm not doing that.

145
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,267
Why are you messing up
the mood now, all right?

146
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,635
We wanna go tell the kids my great
idea about the Together Christmas.

147
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,003
Wait, how did it become
your idea?

148
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,006
It was your idea, but I named
it Together Christmas.

149
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,345
<i>People of Bikini Bottom...</i>

150
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,811
Hey, guys?

151
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,450
Guys. Listen up,
I got a surprise.

152
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,085
Hello?

153
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,621
- Guys. We got a big surprise!
- A surprise?

154
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,289
- Another pony?
- A trampoline?

155
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,392
You leaving?

156
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:07,592
Not quite, okay?

157
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,893
But, no, we got something better
than that, okay?

158
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,496
So much better.
It's gonna be great.

159
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,162
Guys, this year, no more back
and forth at Christmas.

160
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,797
- We're not doing the back and forth.
- Nope. I just said that.

161
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,467
- No more back and forth at Christmas.
- No back and forth.

162
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,570
This year, we're gonna spend one
Christmas all together, all of us!

163
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,005
- Yay!
- All of us. A Together Christmas!

164
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,939
- A Together Christmas!
- Can you be quiet?

165
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,674
A Together Christmas
like a normal family!

166
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,943
Yay!

167
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:25,946
I'll get it.

168
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,380
Hello?

169
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,917
Grandpa Kurt?

170
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,719
Daddy, Grandpa Kurt wants
to talk to you.

171
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,486
No, no, no. Dusty,
I'll just tell him...

172
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,955
No. It's okay, Sara.

173
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,460
Thank you.

174
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,496
Thanks, buddy.

175
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,933
What, Dad?

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,566
Yeah, long time.

177
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,436
No, I'm fine. Tomorrow?

178
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:51,803
- Tomorrow.
- No.

179
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,138
I could probably pick you up,
I guess, but...

180
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,174
- Hey! Psst! Guess what? My folks are coming tomorrow.
- I don't care.

181
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,544
- We can go together.
- You shut up.

182
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:03,017
Dad, do you want to just text...
Hello?

183
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,987
Dusty, listen to me,

184
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,590
I think you're approaching this
with way too much negative energy.

185
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,094
Brad, you don't know what you're
talking about, so shut your fat hole!

186
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,828
Dusty.

187
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,398
I'm sorry, Braddie.
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,034
You see what he does to me?

189
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,869
I mean, he's not even here yet, and
he's already ruining Christmas.

190
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,472
- Okay, okay, relax. Relax.
- I can't!

191
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:29,708
Look, your father hasn't met
the new evolved Dusty.

192
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,443
You're a progressive,
sensitive, child-first parent.

193
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,079
That's exactly the stuff he's gonna
make fun of us for. You'll see.

194
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,848
He's gonna scoff at everything
we do. He's a scoffer, Brad.

195
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,751
Pepe, you have a grown son,
right?

196
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,053
<i>Si.</i>

197
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:43,520
Why don't you tell Dusty here
how much your son means to you

198
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,557
in this season of good cheer?

199
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,530
- You see?
- He didn't say nice things

200
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,730
like you think he did, Brad.

201
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,031
Dusty, you're being silly.

202
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,201
I mean, who wouldn't be
impressed with you?

203
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,102
Come on.

204
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,105
Dear God!

205
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,580
He looks as if he's been
chiseled from Gibraltar itself.

206
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,121
This is gonna come off weird,
Dusty, but he's beautiful.

207
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,527
I want to be his friend so bad.

208
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,704
- Dusty.
- Hey, Pop.

209
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,035
- How was your flight?
- Not bad.

210
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:34,173
Took 20 minutes to get
to the gate though.

211
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:36,375
What's with that bottleneck
you got out there?

212
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:40,812
I'm sorry our local airport tarmac's
not up to your standards, huh?

213
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,682
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you designed this airport,

214
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,116
or I'd have been
more sensitive.

215
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,251
Oh, I guess I'll move to a new
town with a better airport

216
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,655
that way you won't be inconvenienced
when you show up every five years or so.

217
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,958
Same old
Mr. Touchy. I love it.

218
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,425
Here you go, Pancho.

219
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,094
Why don't you bring the car around,
we'll meet you at the curb.

220
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,127
Right away, sir.

221
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,366
I mean, no, I'm sorry,
I'm not the driver.

222
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,567
No, I'm Brad.

223
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:02,867
The stepdad.

224
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,903
- This is Sara's husband.
- Why is he with you?

225
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:07,338
Dad!

226
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,713
That sweater. He wears a red sweater,
so I can see him in a crowd.

227
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,183
Dad!

228
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,921
That's him, that's Dad.

229
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,695
Dad. Dad.

230
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,839
- I made a sign.
- There's my big man.

231
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,709
And this guy's raising
your kids half the time?

232
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,045
He hasn't seen his dad
in a really long time.

233
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,182
It's only been since Thanksgiving,
but it feels like forever.

234
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,717
- It does!
- Oh!

235
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,121
Four weeks? It's been
a few years for us.

236
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,890
What should we do? You want
me to take my pants off?

237
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,259
Hey, where's Mom?

238
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,794
You didn't get her text?

239
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:04,730
Uncle Arny came down with
a bad case of the shingles.

240
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,964
- No.
- So Mom's staying back

241
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,500
- to take care of him.
- Okay.

242
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,534
But, hey, you still got me.

243
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,570
I sure do. I sure do!

244
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,773
Oh!

245
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,676
We're gonna
have the best time.

246
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,776
Oh! Dusty!

247
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,011
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Muscles, come here.

248
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,850
I've got a cold.
Stay away. Don, Don!

249
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,150
Say, Dusty,

250
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,953
Brad told me about this
Together Christmas we're doing.

251
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:33,158
You two are such wonderful,
progressive co-dads.

252
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,358
Co-dads?

253
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,895
I'm so sorry. Mr. Mayron,
this is my father, Don Whitaker.

254
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,863
The pleasure is all mine,
Captain!

255
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,235
You piloted the Space Shuttle
Atlantis in 1992

256
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,505
and commanded the Endeavour
on three missions in 1994!

257
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,175
All right, come on,
we're out this way.

258
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,342
Thanks, Dusty.

259
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,812
Say, Kurt, did you meet any
interesting folks on your flight?

260
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,613
I met a Scotch and a pillow.

261
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,817
You know, actually,
I always pick the flights

262
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,053
that have the most connections
so that

263
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:05,156
I get to chat with as many
new people as possible.

264
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,238
- Oh, so you're a lunatic. Good to know.
- That's me!

265
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,740
Looks like one of your neighbors
is getting an oversized parcel.

266
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,908
Hello!

267
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,209
Don Whitaker,
United States Postal Service!

268
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,246
Retired, but never too old to
lend a hand to a fellow carrier.

269
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,549
Brad, I gotta tell you, this baby
sure gives you a smooth ride.

270
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,618
Oh, thank you, Kurt.

271
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,853
Yeah, it is surprisingly
responsive.

272
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,255
Brad, he's not...

273
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,756
So do they take your balls
right there at the dealership,

274
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,291
or do you send them in
with the registration?

275
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,525
How does it work exactly?

276
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,895
No, no, they didn't take my balls.
Just $2,000 down.

277
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,396
This your place, Dusty?

278
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,899
- I pictured it nicer.
- Yeah, Dusty's house is nicer.

279
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,233
This is my house.

280
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,202
Just thought you'd like to
step in and see the kids.

281
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,838
Only if it's okay. Look, we don't
want to infringe on your days.

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,007
Of course, don't be silly.
Come on, guys.

283
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,578
You got to ask another man's
permission to see your own kids?

284
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,248
Unbelievable.

285
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,350
We're back! With more daddies!

286
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,285
Hey! Look how big you two got!

287
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,621
Come on. Don't I get a hug?
Come on!

288
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,625
And who's this barroom brawler?

289
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,025
He's our brother,
Griffy, silly.

290
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,029
Hey, come here, pardner.
Dusty, you never told me.

291
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,832
- Why, he looks just like you.
- Yeah, not my kid.

292
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,668
Oh, no, no, no.
I fathered that one.

293
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,403
Oh. Ah, then how does he
relate to me then?

294
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,771
Well, he is the brother
of your grandkids, Kurt.

295
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,439
- Oh. Here, here.
- Oh. Okay.

296
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,376
Hey, looking good, Buttercup.

297
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,847
Good to see you.

298
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:36,179
- Look who's here!
- Pop-Pop!

299
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,817
- Tell us a Pop-Pop joke!
- Ooh, ooh.

300
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,118
What's a good one?
Why does a duck have feathers?

301
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,153
Why?

302
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,359
To cover up his butt quack.

303
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,193
Hey, kids,
I got a good one for you.

304
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,596
- Two dead hookers wash up on the shore...
- Hey, hey!

305
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,563
- Whoa, whoa, shut up.
- No way. No way.

306
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,503
- Sara. How's my girl?
- Hi!

307
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,001
What, Ginny couldn't make it?

308
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,236
Oh, she feels terrible.

309
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,039
But she sent a batch of
her special cookies!

310
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,375
- Is there milk in that kitchen?
- Yay!

311
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,310
I want the first one.

312
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,313
I get the first one!

313
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,916
So he gets to be Pop-Pop
and I'm just Grandpa Kurt?

314
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,885
What? I'm in charge of the
cutesy grandpa names now?

315
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,453
Look, if you want a better name, maybe
try showing up a little more often.

316
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,793
Tell the kids, from now on,
it's El Padre.

317
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,097
No more hooker jokes.

318
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,299
These don't taste like La-La's cookies.
They taste like Chips Ahoys.

319
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,834
No, no. I sat right there
in the kitchen

320
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,038
and watched Grandma
bake them just yesterday.

321
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,271
I like them.

322
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,708
So, this co-dads thing,
is that what you call it?

323
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,477
Yeah, that's what we call it.

324
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,813
So, on his watch,
he disciplines your kids,

325
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,714
gives them advice, tucks
them in, so forth

326
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,150
and that bothers
you not a bit?

327
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,250
Doesn't bother me at all.

328
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,185
And his total lack of
masculinity...

329
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:52,122
I mean, his weak chin and soft
underbelly influencing your son,

330
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,824
you're good there,
too? Yeah?

331
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,594
You know what? I'm just feeling like
maybe you guys want a little privacy.

332
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,195
Stay right there,
Brad, all right?

333
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,798
He's just trying
to stir the turd.

334
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,499
You can scoff all you want.

335
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,334
Everything is rock solid
between me and Brad here.

336
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:07,371
- In fact, best friends.
- Really?

337
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,040
- Thank you.
- Brad. Stop it. Now.

338
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,043
- I'm good.
- He gets really emotional.

339
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,078
- Brad. Hey. Brother.
- Did you call me "brother"?

340
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
B-Dawg.
Chill out, man. Relax.

341
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,352
All right? Cut it out.

342
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,385
- Brad, don't.
- I know.

343
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,020
Stop. All right, look. Hey.
Brad, stop!

344
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,158
Looks like you two guys
have a real solid arrangement.

345
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,293
You're spending Christmas
together and everything.

346
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,594
Speaking of which, whose place
are we doing that at?

347
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,630
We're totally happy to host
if it makes it easier.

348
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,432
Yeah, we could do it at my place.
I got more room.

349
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,534
We can do presents at our place,
dinner at yours.

350
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,669
Nah, all that back and forth,
who needs that?

351
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,005
This place, that place.

352
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:43,274
Why don't I book us
a great vacation spot

353
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,076
for all of us,
and we can all spend

354
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,611
the holiday week together?

355
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,879
- Yay! Cool!
- Thanks, El Padre.

356
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,213
I love this idea!

357
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,150
It's something extra Christmasy,

358
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,319
with lots of snow and family
activities for all of us.

359
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,054
Dad, I'm just worried about
finding a place,

360
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,390
you know, this close
to the holiday.

361
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,858
Booked it! Airbnb. All done.

362
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,361
Yay, El Padre!

363
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:07,600
It's gonna be so fun, since we're
all such great friends, huh?

364
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,236
Off to the mountains.
Here we go, Griffy.

365
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,838
- Here we go.
- Big fun trip!

366
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,274
Let me get
that for you, Sara.

367
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

368
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,678
You know, Dusty,
I think you and Kurt

369
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,947
spending some time
around me and my dad

370
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,280
might do you both some good.

371
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,749
Hey, don't you see
what he's up to here?

372
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,052
He thinks you and me are harboring
bad feelings for one another

373
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:30,054
and sticking us together in some cabin is
gonna bring out whatever we're harboring.

374
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,688
But you're not,
are you, Brad?

375
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,957
- I'm not what?
- Harboring!

376
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,291
No, I'm not harboring anything.

377
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,693
Good, 'cause I'm not
harboring anything either.

378
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:36,961
Okay, well, let's use
this as an opportunity

379
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:37,929
to show him
that we're not harboring.

380
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,197
'Cause we're not harboring.

381
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,365
You're looking at
one safe harbor right here.

382
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,900
All right, good.

383
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,534
You sure you want to pack it like that?
Is that how you're gonna do it?

384
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,004
Look, me and Brad got everything
under control as a team, okay?

385
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,472
- Right, Brad?
- That's right.

386
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,973
Yeah, what would I know
about travel?

387
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,341
I've only been
to frickin' space.

388
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,043
What, did you pack
the space shuttle yourself?

389
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,212
You pop the trunk, arrange all the bags
for you and your little space friends?

390
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,483
I did, as a matter of fact.
Yes, I packed the shuttle.

391
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,951
That's so cool!

392
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:01,953
I love how you're always
jotting down ideas

393
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,054
for your book
in your little notepad.

394
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,322
People ever get crazy and think

395
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,193
you might be writing
something bad about them?

396
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:14,665
Say, Brad, would you mind doing some
"Yes, And" drills with me on the way?

397
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,268
"Yes, And" thank you
for asking me.

398
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,204
I recently joined
an improv comedy workshop.

399
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,138
Brad's been pushing me to do it
for years.

400
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,575
Because you're so funny.

401
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,076
Yeah, I really enjoy it.

402
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,376
You should look into it, too,
Kurt.

403
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,413
I'd rather look into
a loaded gun.

404
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,147
- Did you hear that?
- Did you just make that up?

405
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,148
- Zinger!
- That's provocative, too.

406
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,684
You ready to let me do that,
Mr. Stubborn?

407
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,853
- I got it.
- It's never gonna fit.

408
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,288
Hey, kids, no, no, no, no,

409
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,957
why don't you jump into my car
with Adrianna, all right?

410
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:44,395
So Grandpa Kurt here can enjoy Pop-Pop's
company on the way up.

411
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,232
Already warmed up a spot
in the capsule for you, Captain!

412
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,336
Still never gonna fit. Ever.

413
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,739
No, I got it. It's fitting fine.

414
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,609
I just had to put it wheels-in.

415
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,446
Perfect fit!
All right, let's go.

416
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,383
Hey, Adrianna, you know,
when we're up there,

417
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,952
I can teach you
how to snowboard.

418
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,118
You're not my dad.

419
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,490
All right.
It's gonna be a fun trip.

420
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,561
It's time for
One-Word Story.

421
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,030
Anyone can join in, doesn't have
to be just Dad and I.

422
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,634
You always give us
the best start.

423
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,801
- Uncle...
- ...Thomas...

424
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,404
- ...went...
- ...tiptoeing...

425
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,606
...into the...

426
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,074
...Empire State Building.

427
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,042
Where were you going
with that one?

428
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,445
This all took place
at the pancake breakfast!

429
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,214
<i>♪ Fifty-six bottles of beer
on the wall</i>

430
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,017
<i>♪ Fifty-six bottles of beer ♪</i>

431
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:41,152
"G." Georgia,
Georgia license plate!

432
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,089
Ready, and... Quiet Game.

433
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,424
- I'm terrible at this game!
- I can't do it!

434
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,292
- I just can't do it.
- I hate the Quiet Game!

435
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,446
We always
liked the Shimpahs.

436
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,951
The movers thought the Shimpahs' house
was our house and almost moved us in there!

437
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,921
The wrong family! We would've
been living with the Shimpahs!

438
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,489
Which I wouldn't
have minded,

439
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,358
'cause I had a huge crush
on Vicky Shimpah.

440
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,029
Dad, thank you.

441
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,130
You make a five-hour trip
go by like that!

442
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,831
I just wanted everybody
to have a good time.

443
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,800
Nothing like a nice,
relaxing road trip, huh, Dad?

444
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,035
It was nothing.

445
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,671
I've been in a confined
space with a chimp.

446
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,290
Dylan's got a girlfriend!

447
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,460
No, I don't! Be quiet!

448
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,760
Yeah, you love her.

449
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,995
You want to buy her flowers
and kiss her on the lips.

450
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,530
Stop it! It's not funny!

451
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,733
Megan! What did I say about
teasing your brother about girls?

452
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,802
She's still doing it.

453
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,671
And she drilled him in the head
with a snowball too.

454
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,739
Well, I'm not her mother.

455
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,408
Now, go take your brother
inside, please. Go on, sweetie.

456
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,576
Come on, Griffy.

457
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,312
So Dylan's started
noticing the girls?

458
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,482
You know, I think it's gonna
be time to give him the talk.

459
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,351
The talk? You mean the talk
about the nitty-gritty?

460
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,221
- The "nitty-gritty"?
- I'm on it, Sar-Bear.

461
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,755
I've been looking forward to
this for a long time.

462
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,290
I got a whole speech prepared,
all right?

463
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,692
It's all heartwarming stuff.

464
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,263
I'm sure you and Brad will do
a bang-up job with that.

465
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,630
Unless this isn't
a co-dadding moment?

466
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,000
- No.
- No.

467
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,667
- I mean, no, of course it is.
- It is.

468
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,135
- Yeah, it is. It's gonna be.
- Okay, yeah.

469
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,672
Yeah, we're gonna
talk to him together.

470
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:43,477
Oh, Dusty! I read about some
gender-neutral flashcards.

471
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,376
Flashcards.

472
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,478
He's got flashcards
to teach your son how to score.

473
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,812
No, of course not.

474
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,482
They cover human reproduction,
puberty, and hygiene.

475
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,885
Okay, great. You tee it
up with the flashcards,

476
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,720
and I'll knock it home
with the heartwarming speech.

477
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,689
- All right? We got this.
- You're all set.

478
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:02,425
I'll never forget when Brad first
started asking questions about girls.

479
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,396
I took him out for "the talk."

480
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,598
He was so inquisitive and
attentive.

481
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,568
Then I dropped him back off
at his dorm.

482
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,572
Yeah...

483
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:14,541
Well, come on in.

484
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,744
Hey, look, there's a game room!

485
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,914
- Wow. Adrianna, look.
- And a pool table!

486
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,214
This is what I'm talking about.

487
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,250
Look at that view!

488
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,619
Look at all the mortise and
tenon joinery!

489
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,788
Sittin' fat.

490
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,557
Your old man sure pulled the
right rein getting this place.

491
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,724
Oh, wow. I know. Better throw
you a parade, huh?

492
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,395
Oh, I am really
looking forward to that.

493
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,263
Well, you want the thank yous
printed on the bass drums

494
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,463
or the sousaphone covers?

495
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,802
Hey, did anyone bring my bag in?

496
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,005
My supervisor Clyde Unix...

497
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,274
He took over after
Kirby Keller retired in '86.

498
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,145
Horse farm,
upper peninsula of Michigan.

499
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,416
Gorgeous country,
if you ever get the chance.

500
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,421
Wow.

501
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,423
Nice shower.

502
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,493
That's weird.

503
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,895
No controls.

504
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,163
Hey, honey,
how do you turn the shower on?

505
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,098
<i>Shower on.</i>

506
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,633
Off! Shower off!

507
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,734
<i>Shower off.</i>

508
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,538
Gosh! Ooh!

509
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,740
Voice-activated water. Cool.

510
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:24,642
<i>Water cool.</i>

511
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,310
- Off! Shower off!
<i>- Shower off.</i>

512
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,180
- Water... Cool...
- <i>Water. Shower cool.</i>

513
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,916
- Cool the water.
- <i>Water cool.</i>

514
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,887
Water off! Turn off!

515
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,355
Off.

516
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,088
Oh, my God.

517
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,325
Oh, my God!

518
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,594
You scored on yourself.
Friendly fire.

519
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:44,295
Eight ball,
corner pocket.

520
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:45,695
- Ooh! No slashing.
- Yeah.

521
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,734
- Good job, babe.
- Thank you, babe.

522
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,202
Come on, Sara!

523
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,806
No, that is holding.

524
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,276
It's too loud, Dylan!
Turn it down!

525
00:22:58,278 --> 00:22:59,376
I don't know how!

526
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,346
Hey, hey, hey, turn that down!

527
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:03,015
Griffy's asleep.

528
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,285
Why are you dressed like
a woman, Brad?

529
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,520
I can't find my stuff.

530
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,254
Are you sure you got my bag
to fit in the car?

531
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,623
Yeah, of course. It fit perfect.

532
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,791
Look, can we skip this one?
I can't stand this song.

533
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:18,229
- Skip it. Skip it, guys.
- Oh, no, no, no! No, Sara.

534
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,864
This is a great song.

535
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,266
This is my real dad's
favorite Christmas song.

536
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,434
Yeah, well, I'm glad it makes
him happy.

537
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,869
You think I don't want to like
this song?

538
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,272
Of course I want to,
it's a super uplifting song.

539
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,474
- Yeah.
- But he ruined it for me.

540
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,943
What are you talking about?

541
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,546
All right, so I'm 12 years old,
and I join the Glee Club.

542
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,013
Glee Club.

543
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,182
All my buddies in the neighborhood,
they gave me crap over it,

544
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,718
but I don't care,
because for the holiday pageant

545
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,351
we're doing
<i>Do They Know It's Christmas?,</i>

546
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,887
and I was determined
to land that Bono part.

547
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:48,626
<i>♪ There's a world outside
your window</i>

548
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:52,762
<i>♪ And it's a world of dread
and fear</i>

549
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:56,366
<i>♪ Where the only water
flowing is...</i>

550
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,337
<i>So my buddy Derrick Lindmeyer
is laying into the Sting part,</i>

551
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,606
<i>when out in the audience,
what do I see?</i>

552
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,209
<i>My dad giving Scotty
Kimball's mom a foot rub,</i>

553
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:06,580
<i>not even paying attention!</i>

554
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:14,751
<i>I totally missed the Bono part,
and everybody made fun of me.</i>

555
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,791
<i>♪ And there won't be

556
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,395
<i>♪ this Christmastime... ♪</i>

557
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:26,129
I got no recollection of that.

558
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,432
Yeah, well, I do, all right?

559
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:28,866
And I got a lot of other
stories just like it.

560
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,135
Science Fair, you left
with Brian Higby's mom.

561
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:34,538
Little League regionals, you left with
Mark Fitzgerald's mom and his aunt!

562
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,007
Oh, yeah,
now that I remember.

563
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:37,541
Yeah, yeah.
That went into extra innings.

564
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,010
Know what I mean, kid?

565
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:40,414
- No.
- Ah.

566
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:41,915
Nice.

567
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,984
Dusty! Dusty! Come on.

568
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,587
He's gonna ruin Christmas, Brad,
I'm telling you.

569
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,824
Look, I hate to hit you
with the tough love,

570
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,725
but the only person
who can ruin your Christmas

571
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,664
is looking back at you
from that mirror.

572
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,199
- All I see is you, Brad.
- Oh.

573
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,070
Okay. Well, sorry. Here. Here.

574
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:06,572
There. There we go.

575
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,505
- Still you, Brad.
- Is it?

576
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,874
Yeah, it's still you.

577
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,710
Okay, well, look, I'm looking
at you, so I meant you.

578
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,444
Well, I'm looking at you,
so I see you.

579
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,678
Forget the mirror.

580
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,414
You're the only one
who can ruin your Christmas.

581
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,648
Don't look at the mirror!

582
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,884
I'm still looking at you
if I look in the mirror.

583
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,453
Don't worry about the mirror.
That was bad.

584
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,122
- Forget the mirror exists.
- Okay.

585
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,655
Let's just focus on those kids

586
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,828
and giving them
a better childhood than you had.

587
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:30,928
- You're right.
- Yeah?

588
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,895
It's about them.

589
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,164
It's about giving them
a better Christmas.

590
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,498
There you go.

591
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,299
Yeah, and then we jam that amazing
Christmas right in his butthole!

592
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,434
Yes, we do.
Wait! Whoa, whoa! No.

593
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,971
Yes!

594
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,039
You know, Dusty, I'm just gonna
take the mirror down.

595
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,974
Then we don't have to worry
about it.

596
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,779
Yeah!

597
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:49,814
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

598
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,852
Hey, where's your glove?

599
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,488
No! Griffy!

600
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,222
Excuse me.

601
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:01,893
Griffy!

602
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,631
Griffy! Hey!

603
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:07,130
Griffy!

604
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,232
Griffy!

605
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,168
Watch out, honey!

606
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,178
Is that Brad?

607
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,749
- That's Brad!
- That's Brad.

608
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,851
That boy never...

609
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,623
Hey, come here. Look at this.

610
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,031
Mmm. Honey.

611
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,266
- Oh.
- Ow!

612
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,003
Dusty, you like that?

613
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,808
Let me capture
this for posterity.

614
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,712
The Nativity is a big deal
in Terra Haute.

615
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,781
This is the Redeemer,
this is Abundant Life.

616
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,849
Dad.

617
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,621
Let's go, Pop-Pop.

618
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:09,460
- It's real pretty.
- We'll take the pretty gun.

619
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,928
No. No, no, no, no.

620
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,066
We're not gonna take that today
'cause we are a gun-free family.

621
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:18,672
Good Lord.
What has he turned you into?

622
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,580
- Ahh!
- Ha-ha!

623
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,980
All right, throw it down!

624
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,218
All right, here it comes,
Braddie!

625
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,193
Brad!

626
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,932
Hey, honey!

627
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,567
Brad! Brad!

628
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:52,203
You need a hat.
You're gonna freeze, babe.

629
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:53,404
Thanks, sweetie.

630
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,872
You look cute.

631
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:58,274
Hey, I want to talk to you.
I'm worried about your dad.

632
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,412
Don't you think he seems slightly
less chatty than normal?

633
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:02,782
You got to be shitting me.

634
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,582
I mean, he shows up here without
your mom?

635
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,085
Don't you think that's weird?
There might be a problem?

636
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,953
With my mom and dad's
relationship?

637
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:10,855
Yeah!

638
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:13,359
What? They love each other
more than we do!

639
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:14,857
Yeah.

640
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,559
I brought you your hat!

641
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,529
No, honey,
I didn't mean it that way.

642
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,597
It's a huge compliment. Come on.

643
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,764
You got to understand.

644
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,669
Brad! The Christmas lights!

645
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,904
No, no, no, no.

646
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,039
All the light strands
are connected.

647
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,275
A terrible idea!

648
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,782
None of these switches work!

649
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,084
Heads up.

650
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:42,453
Dad! What are these levers for?

651
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:43,721
Ow!

652
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,355
- Sara!
- Stand clear!

653
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,426
Brad!

654
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,630
Brad, let it go!

655
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,132
I don't want it to hit your car.

656
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,270
Let it go!

657
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,405
- Tell him to let it go.
- Let it go!

658
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:12,786
Are you all right?

659
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,055
Look what you did
to the side of my car, man.

660
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,660
Dusty, I'm so sorry.

661
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,395
Honey!

662
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,435
I'm not putting that Santa Claus
back up there.

663
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,705
I don't want to put it back
on the roof, either.

664
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,808
Why didn't he let go?

665
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,445
Because he's an idiot!

666
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,127
Son of a...

667
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:02,502
Don.

668
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,468
Don.

669
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,239
Don, wake up. Don!

670
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,440
Don, wake up! Don! Don!

671
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,780
Kurt, are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

672
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:16,946
Do you need to talk?

673
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,517
Yeah, I need to be held.
My heart hurts. No!

674
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,252
Did you touch the thermostat?
Did you turn it up?

675
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,721
Well, of course not.

676
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:25,489
Did somebody fiddle
with the thermostat?

677
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,656
Yes! It's 85 degrees.

678
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,992
85! Do you have
any idea how much

679
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,162
even a few degrees
can impact the gas bill?

680
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,030
Of course I do!
It's unthinkable.

681
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:36,232
Dad? Kurt?
What's going on in here?

682
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,099
Why is it so hot?

683
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,002
Someone fiddled
with the thermostat!

684
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,273
What? Who would do that?

685
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,547
What do you think you're doing?

686
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,982
It's roasting in here!

687
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,251
I like to sleep
with my window open.

688
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,551
Hey, kid.

689
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,356
Are you allowed to touch the
thermostat at your mom's house?

690
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,359
Duh.

691
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,928
What is going on?

692
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,097
Adrianna! She turned
up the thermostat!

693
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,165
Said she fiddles with
the thermostat at your place

694
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,902
any time she damn well pleases.

695
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,695
Dusty, is that true?
Tell me that's not true.

696
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,740
Oh, criminy, Dusty!

697
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,209
You might as well give her your wallet
and your 401 while you're at it!

698
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,344
Brad, do you let the kids touch
the thermostat at your house?

699
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:25,049
What? No! The thermostat
is a sacred covenant.

700
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,617
I can't believe
we're even talking about this!

701
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,086
This is madness!

702
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,020
Oh, God, even Brad's got
his house in order.

703
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,356
Hey, you got no right to talk,
all right?

704
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,991
It wasn't hard to keep me away
from the thermostat

705
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,591
once you shipped me off
to military school.

706
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,760
Kurt, you didn't.

707
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:37,895
He was out of control.
He was a bedwetter.

708
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,730
I was a bedwetter.
Were you a bedwetter?

709
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,064
I was four years old!

710
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,133
Okay,
everyone take it easy.

711
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:46,235
It's not Dusty's fault that he
lets Adrianna walk all over him.

712
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,870
She does not walk all over me!

713
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,705
I can see how being a stepdad,

714
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,510
you might not feel empowered to
discipline someone else's child.

715
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,980
Hey, quit your scoffing, all right?

716
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:57,147
And you two quit helping me.

717
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:01,551
Look, Karen and Roger spoil her
to no end.

718
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,420
It's crazy!

719
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,289
And there's nothing you can do.
I get it!

720
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,825
You're the stepdad.
You're screwed.

721
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:09,693
That kid's never
gonna respect you

722
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,231
unless you bring
the hammer down.

723
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,906
What the hell was that, Brad?

724
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,809
I know.
He's old school.

725
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:26,644
I think you handled this
really well, Brad.

726
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,882
I'm so proud of the way
you express yourself.

727
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,884
Come here.

728
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,218
Again? Really?

729
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,253
Good night, Dusty!

730
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,423
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, Brad.

731
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:00,110
- Jump! Jump!
- Come on, Griff.

732
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,647
Jumpy, jumpy, jumpy!

733
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,382
Casey's here!

734
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,118
Hey, guys.

735
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:06,584
Hey.

736
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,652
Hey, Dylan, look.
Casey's here.

737
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,053
You want to come French her?

738
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,856
Yeah, you want to go do French
on your girlfriend, Dylan?

739
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,157
Megan! Leave him alone.

740
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,560
And where did you learn
"do French"?

741
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,563
I'll go talk to him.

742
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,270
Dylan? You okay, buddy?

743
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,141
I just... I don't get
the whole girls thing.

744
00:33:30,143 --> 00:33:31,308
Oh.

745
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,943
Girls, yeah.
Yeah, that can be tricky.

746
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,079
But you know who'd be really good
in explaining that department?

747
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,415
Your dad. Let me go grab him.

748
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,850
No, Brad! I just want to
talk to you about this.

749
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,118
Just you, Brad, please?

750
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,122
Me? You sure you don't want to
talk to your dad?

751
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:47,557
Oh, well, girls. Okay.

752
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,826
Huh. Um...

753
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,030
All right, the girl talk.

754
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,764
You know, boys have a...

755
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,667
A dingle, right? And girls have
a hoo-hoo or a whim-wham.

756
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,203
- Brad, I already know about that stuff.
- You do?

757
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,306
- Yes. From school, and it's gross.
- Perfect!

758
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:05,041
I just want to know what to do
if I, you know,

759
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,476
I like somebody.

760
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:07,479
Right, well...

761
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,212
You want to become
her friend first.

762
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,448
You want to be that one
that she confides in,

763
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,318
that she tells you
about all of her problems

764
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,019
with the guys
she's actually dating.

765
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,120
Got it.

766
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,354
It's called the Friend Zone.

767
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:22,158
And it's where
we Whitaker men thrive.

768
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,194
We're the best in the biz.
Yeah.

769
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:29,198
Here we are in a wild frontier,
full of majestic pines,

770
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,035
and you two numb nuts are
sorting through

771
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:33,537
a bunch of dried twigs
on a Rite Aid parking lot.

772
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,671
You just can't go out on public
land and cut down a tree, Dad.

773
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,741
Dusty, we are the public.
We own those trees.

774
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,580
Oh, I get it. You need to
ask co-dad for permission.

775
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,682
Oh, shut up. I know what you're
trying to do.

776
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,151
What am I doing?

777
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:49,252
Make it look like I can't make a move
without checking in with Brad first.

778
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,089
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
Am I right about that?

779
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,426
Oh, God.

780
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,497
And we own the paint
in the Friend Zone.

781
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,765
And sure we're gonna lose some.
Doesn't matter.

782
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,834
We're gonna lose a lot,
I'll be frank with you.

783
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,202
Well, what do you know?

784
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,372
Brad's having that
nitty-gritty talk for you.

785
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:12,508
Must be nice to have someone
to handle the tough stuff, huh?

786
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,511
And eventually
you'll keep in touch.

787
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,180
You might even be invited to
their wedding!

788
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,348
And their dad's like,
"Brad, what are you doing here?

789
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,852
"Teresa never talks about you!"

790
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,486
And you're like, "I'm invited."

791
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:25,923
And he's, "I wonder about that."

792
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:27,524
And you show them the proof!

793
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,493
Always bring the wedding invite
with you.

794
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,627
- Then they can't kick you out.
- Okay.

795
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,098
But you'll be sad ultimately
knowing that she's not with you,

796
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,667
and you want to prepare yourself
with, like, a mixtape of sad songs.

797
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,171
Anything from Chicago
is usually pretty good.

798
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,908
<i>♪ If you leave me now</i>

799
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,113

800
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:51,013
I don't really know that song.

801
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,820
<i>♪ Ooh-wee, no, baby, please
don't go ♪</i>

802
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,455
Wait! No, no, no! Dylan,

803
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,691
that is the worst advice
anyone could give you.

804
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:01,825
Listen to your dad, please.

805
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,993
It's okay, Dad.
We don't have to talk about it.

806
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,995
No, no, buddy, buddy, wait,
wait, look!

807
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,897
Hey, this stuff is all about
confidence.

808
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,334
You just got to believe you're
the best she's ever gonna find.

809
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,236
You believe that to your core, and
she will, too, I promise you.

810
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,403
But what if she doesn't?

811
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,872
Buddy, you can't be afraid
of rejection.

812
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,107
You'll never find love

813
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,975
if you're too scared to
put yourself out there.

814
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,243
Hey, Goggles?

815
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,578
Mistletoe is your ticket.

816
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,149
You walk right up to her,
you dangle this over her head,

817
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:27,551
and then you slap your spaghetti
suckers right on her.

818
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:28,984
I don't know if that's
appropriate.

819
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,254
It's a time-honored holiday
tradition, Mr. War-On-Christmas.

820
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,191
Then you give her a nice smack
on the caboose

821
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,825
and tell her what a lucky girl
she is.

822
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,894
- Don't listen to that part, all right?
- Yeah, don't listen to that part.

823
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,296
Look at me. Look at me.

824
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,696
You want to be like Brad
and be in the Friend Zone,

825
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,265
or you wanna be Dad
and get in the end zone?

826
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,999
This worked for me when I was
your age.

827
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,337
You want to go for it, buddy?

828
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,504
Come on, you can do this.

829
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:53,713
<i>♪ A love like ours
is love that's hard to find</i>

830
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,249
<i>♪ How could we let it
slip away? ♪</i>

831
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,319
No! I like Brad's way more.

832
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:05,258
I just want to be her friend
and listen to her problems!

833
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,198
My tree, my tree,
my tree, my tree.

834
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,366
My tree, my tree.

835
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,435
Can I yell "Timber"?

836
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,604
- Sure can, sweetheart.
- Yay!

837
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,705
Is this okay?

838
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,274
Are any of these trees
even gonna fit in the cabin?

839
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,042
We're gonna cut off
the top 25 feet

840
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,144
and chop the rest up for
firewood, Don.

841
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,312
Oh.

842
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,281
Now, this is the Duster Buster
I remember.

843
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:35,218
A certified badass
that makes his own rules!

844
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,423
Go find a good tree, would you?

845
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,756
Boy, I don't know about this,
Kurt.

846
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,493
Isn't it illegal to harvest
a tree from public lands?

847
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,595
Oh, hell, yeah.
It's a federal crime.

848
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,798
I tried to talk him out of it, but you
know how stubborn that kid can be.

849
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,466
Okay.

850
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,803
Dusty, look, I know you're upset
about Dylan, but I just...

851
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,939
I told you, Brad, I'm not upset,
all right? We're co-dads!

852
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,743
If he prefers your terrible
advice, fine, I'm cool with that.

853
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,011
I just want to find the perfect
Together Christmas tree.

854
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,914
Well, I just don't know if
it's the best choice, you know?

855
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:07,883
Well, maybe we're not always gonna
do everything your way every time.

856
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,086
Trouble in paradise, fellas?

857
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:11,624
- No, we're picking a tree.
- Just having a conversation.

858
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:14,359
El Padre!

859
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:15,758
Lookit!

860
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,394
Hey, what, kids?
What, you find a dead squirrel?

861
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,097
We don't have to
do things my way.

862
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,164
- Really?
- Yeah.

863
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,765
What about baseball snack?

864
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,501
I just wanted to give out Fruit
Roll-Ups, and what's the big deal?

865
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:27,104
No, I just feel like organic
fruit is much more nutritious

866
00:38:27,106 --> 00:38:28,439
than its rolled-up counterpart.

867
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:30,140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

868
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,142
And what about Megan's diorama? You
didn't want to use any of my ideas.

869
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,542
Your only idea was
the Bay of Pigs!

870
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,278
But it's an important event
in our nation's history!

871
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,914
It was bloody.

872
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,048
You wanted her to do green energy
so you could look Mr. Perfect Dad.

873
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,517
- I'm not Mr. Perfect Dad.
- You act like Mr. Perfect Dad.

874
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,718
I'm not Mr. Perfect Dad.

875
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,153
And we don't have to do things
my way.

876
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,858
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

877
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,959
Okay. You don't think I can
operate a chainsaw, do you?

878
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:53,796
Guess who got his woodlands
management badge in Webelos.

879
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:56,332
I did! Brad Whitaker.

880
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,935
Ah!

881
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:02,875
Dusty, look at this one.
Perfectly symmetrical.

882
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,510
Okay.

883
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,111
Oh, yeah.

884
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,981
Keep an eye out for rangers!

885
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:15,218
I've got to pinpoint
a 60 degree angle top cut.

886
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,723
That's what I'm gonna do first.

887
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,026
Oh, yeah!
She's cutting like butter!

888
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,430
Hey, Brad, isn't that a...

889
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,374
Hold it, hold it!

890
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,910
Timber!

891
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,379
Wow!

892
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,781
Brad, you cut down
a cell phone tower.

893
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,783
Why'd you cut down
a cell phone tower?

894
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:48,885
No bars? No bars?

895
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,089
- That was excellent!
- Get up.

896
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,223
- You really stuck that landing, man.
- Would you get up?

897
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:56,993
I'd give you a 9.2 on my card.

898
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,462
- Brad, get up.
- I think Brad's dead again.

899
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,564
Man, you killed
the poor bastard!

900
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,999
Brad, don't go into the light!

901
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:05,568
It's okay, sweetheart.
El Padre will bring him back.

902
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,236
- Stand clear.
- I got it, all right?

903
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,837
It's your fault
we're even out here.

904
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,941
You're getting in our heads and
starting static between me and Brad.

905
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:13,609
There's plenty of static
between you and Brad already.

906
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,379
And you know what? Deep down,
you want him dead, don't you?

907
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:17,714
You can say it.

908
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,783
We all want him dead. I want him dead.
Everybody does.

909
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,251
- What?
- Come on, admit it.

910
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,752
Why don't you admit why you
invited yourself to Christmas?

911
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,287
Well, why don't you tell me,
smart guy?

912
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,823
'Cause you knew I was back here
trying to be a good dad,

913
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,957
be around for my kids
the way you never were for me.

914
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,961
That's why you want to crap all
over it.

915
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,365
Get up, Brad!

916
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,231
Oh, my God, what happened?

917
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,066
You cut down
a cell phone tower, Brad.

918
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,502
You know, you're right.

919
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:40,005
I did invite myself
to Christmas.

920
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,575
But that's because you never do.

921
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,510
I feel like I died again.
Did I die again?

922
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:48,948
A little bit. Come on.

923
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,551
Okay. Our report's
all squared away.

924
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,285
Yimmy, Bill,
thank you guys so much

925
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,787
for the understanding.
We really appreciate it.

926
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,256
I'm so sorry.
I'm truly embarrassed.

927
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,392
No, hey.
It was an honest mistake.

928
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:03,892
Okay, you're all set.

929
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,597
Okay, We'd better get back
to the site and lock it down.

930
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,399
Hold on one second.

931
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:12,435
Is there any way
we could do better than $20,000?

932
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:15,004
Can't you reuse some
of the antenna equipment?

933
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,607
Sorry, no. These old 4G units
are obsolete already.

934
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,577
That's why you're getting
this one so cheap!

935
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,479
- It looks really nice, though.
- It sure does.

936
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,214
Hey, guys, keep it up, it looks
great. Happy Holidays.

937
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,749
Happy Christmas, guys. Thanks.

938
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:30,086
Please tell me you did not just
spend $20,000 on a Christmas tree?

939
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:32,825
Twenty thousand dollars.
"Can you hear me now?"

940
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,194
You want some eggnog?

941
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,162
- Mmm. Yummy.
- Hey!

942
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,698
- I want some!
- Me, too!

943
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,499
Now, girls,
that's a grown-up drink.

944
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,468
Yes. Thank you, Karen.

945
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,236
So we're only gonna have one.

946
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,504
What? No, no, no!

947
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,509
There's rum in there,
so not any.

948
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:51,877
Aw!

949
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,345
Are you writing about me?

950
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,847
All right. Somebody want
to plug her in?

951
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,050
Yeah, I got it.

952
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,086
Cool!

953
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,756
That's weird.

954
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,660
Wow!

955
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,676
What do you think?

956
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,343
It's so pretty.

957
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,879
Well, it ought to be
at 1,200 bucks a foot.

958
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,180
Dad, we're lighting the tree!

959
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,216
Where's my dad?

960
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,318
Yeah, I thought it was
a little quiet around here.

961
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,886
- Pop-Pop?
- Don?

962
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,923
Pop-Pop?

963
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,526
Is he still outside?

964
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,563
Dad!

965
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,800
Dad?

966
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:49,902
Dad?

967
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,102
Brad!

968
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:53,870
Dad! Where are you?

969
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:56,339
- I found him! Where are you?
- I don't know.

970
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,240
- Are you hurt?
- Oh, no, no!

971
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,144
No, I just can't quite get up.

972
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:02,577
Oh!

973
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,214
Dad, don't move.

974
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:06,048
There's a pack of wolves on you.

975
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,950
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

976
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,218
I can feel something
tugging at my trousers.

977
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,990
- What color are they, Brad?
- They're gray wolves.

978
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:15,191
That'll be <i>Canis lupus.</i>
They're dangerous.

979
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,760
Really? They look like you
could just reach out and pet them.

980
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,162
I kind of want to pet them, Dad.

981
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,932
Now, Brad. Don't make eye
contact with the alpha wolf.

982
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:24,399
I already did!
Right in the eyes.

983
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,901
Don't show any fear.

984
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,004
I don't want to watch the wolves
eat you!

985
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:30,207
Breathe deep
and pull yourself together.

986
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:31,741
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

987
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:32,745
Hut!

988
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,745
Hut! Hurt!

989
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,515
Are you saying "hut" or "hurt"?

990
00:43:38,517 --> 00:43:40,015
Dad, what happened?

991
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:43,319
You know, I saw the nicest tree
a ways off,

992
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,421
and I got a little off course.

993
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:48,524
I tried to call you, but all of
a sudden my signal dropped!

994
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,591
Really?

995
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:50,827
I tried to find my way back,

996
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,796
but at some point I lost
consciousness.

997
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,267
That's about when the wolves
must have come across me.

998
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,501
It's all right, fellas.

999
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,638
You didn't have to go to any
trouble. It's all good.

1000
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,544
I'm sorry for all the hugs.

1001
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,013
I kind of don't want to let go.

1002
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,216
I almost thought I'd lost you
out there to those nasty wolves.

1003
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,185
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

1004
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:19,756
Well, of course I do.
You tweet about it every day.

1005
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:22,426
You know how much I love you,
too, don't you?

1006
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:25,030
Your answer is right in here.

1007
00:44:25,698 --> 00:44:27,229
I can see it!

1008
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,801
Okay, now that everyone is
accounted for,

1009
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:34,537
can we please talk about who is
paying for that monstrosity?

1010
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,406
Well, you know, it was Dusty's
idea to cut down the tree.

1011
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,075
Yeah, and it was your idea to cut
down the cell phone tower, Brad.

1012
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,410
Great, so as per usual
we get stuck paying.

1013
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:44,781
- Wait, what does that mean?
- I think it's a nice tree.

1014
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,749
I don't know. Dylan's retainer?
Megan's flute?

1015
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,785
What about Tae Kwon Do
that you signed them up for

1016
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,118
and didn't even ask us about?

1017
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,689
Yes, and who paid for the trip
to the aquarium last week?

1018
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:53,923
It's a really nice tree.

1019
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55,658
So now we're keeping score, huh?

1020
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,727
Well, who paid for the parking and
bought each one of them a blowup orca?

1021
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,863
After we told them they
couldn't have a blowup orca!

1022
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,064
Yeah, because you were too cheap
to buy them a blowup orca!

1023
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,466
Who crushed my car with a snow
blower? You did, Brad.

1024
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:05,767
Who crushed my car
with a motorcycle?

1025
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,102
Hello! You again!

1026
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:07,970
Hey!

1027
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,437
It's a beautiful tree!

1028
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:11,941
It's beautiful, all right?

1029
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,213
Okay, yeah. Dad's right.

1030
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,814
It's a beautiful tree.

1031
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,450
Whoa!

1032
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:23,419
Don, I'm sorry, I don't think I'm
gonna be able to save the foot.

1033
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:24,620
Yeah, that baby's coming off.

1034
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,522
I'll need some morphine
and a bread knife.

1035
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,890
Brad, hold him down.

1036
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,026
Oh, no.
That's just my feet.

1037
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:32,093
It's the mail carrier's curse.

1038
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:34,430
Back when I used to
sleep with your mom,

1039
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:38,935
I once scratched her leg so bad
with a piece of rogue heel skin,

1040
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:40,604
it actually drew blood.

1041
00:45:40,606 --> 00:45:43,008
What do you mean,
used to sleep with Ginny?

1042
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,006
What?

1043
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,077
Oh. We sleep
in separate bedrooms.

1044
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,214
You know how badly I snore,
Brad.

1045
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:53,182
Boy, that is inspiring!

1046
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:57,255
You know? The way you're always so
considerate to the other person.

1047
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,655
Ugh.

1048
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,859
I really want to take
this foot off.

1049
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:12,368
Hey, sweetie.

1050
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,903
You know, you might want to
close your window.

1051
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,372
You know, since it's winter?

1052
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:16,740
You're not my dad.

1053
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:19,075
You know, I appreciate you reminding
me of that every few hours.

1054
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:20,376
But, you know,
we're not the only people here,

1055
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,212
so maybe we set the thermostat
to like 75?

1056
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,415
I mean, that's still really
toasty, right?

1057
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:26,448
85.

1058
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,651
Okay, well, what if I counter
you at like 78?

1059
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,187
And then you negotiate with me,
you come back at like 83,

1060
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,856
and then maybe we settle
at like 80.

1061
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,557
- What do you say to that?
- 81.

1062
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,026
Deal!

1063
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,428
Look at that. The two of us
are starting to see eye to eye.

1064
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,064
Thank you, sweetie.

1065
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:42,332
Thank God.

1066
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:45,301
There's Brad with some makeup
cocoa for being such a jerk.

1067
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,870
Thank you.

1068
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:49,506
- Brad! What are you doing?
- Oh, God.

1069
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:52,642
- Why would you do that?
- Look what you made me do!

1070
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,077
- I didn't do anything.
- I didn't make you do it!

1071
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,377
I thought you were bringing me
hot makeup cocoa

1072
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,845
and you just, like,
threw it all over yourself.

1073
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,147
You almost burned me, Brad!

1074
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,383
- I wasn't bringing you makeup cocoa.
- Why not?

1075
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:02,118
I would've said, "Here, bud,
here's some makeup cocoa."

1076
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,287
- I've been waiting for my makeup cocoa.
- I didn't know that!

1077
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,859
If I knew you wanted makeup
cocoa, I would've...

1078
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,325
81!

1079
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,258
No, no, don't touch that!

1080
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,426
I talked her down
from the high 80s.

1081
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:12,194
I'm making progress with her.
This is good.

1082
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,629
I thought you had
your house in order.

1083
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:14,865
Look, don't you see?

1084
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,265
We're doing exactly
what he wants.

1085
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:17,566
We're letting things
out of the harbor!

1086
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:18,868
- So you are harboring.
- Of course I'm harboring!

1087
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,202
And so are you.

1088
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,305
Harboring was working just fine
before he showed up.

1089
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:23,906
Let's get everything
back in the harbor

1090
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,475
and let's harbor it all back
in and close up the harbor.

1091
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,644
I don't know if I can!

1092
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:29,511
Remember you said let's put the
focus back on the kids?

1093
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,182
That was a great idea!

1094
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,383
- Fine. Harbor's closed.
- Good.

1095
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,453
But we're going halfsies
on the cell tower.

1096
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,256
Fine, halfsies
on the cell tower.

1097
00:47:39,258 --> 00:47:40,926
Brad, are you okay?

1098
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:43,359
Yeah.

1099
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,928
- Did you make tee-tee in bed?
- No, it's cocoa.

1100
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,897
Did your cocoa make you tee-tee
in bed?

1101
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:49,464
You're sleepwalking.
Go back to sleep.

1102
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,236
The big boy doesn't
have to be embarrassed.

1103
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,809
How would I pee upwards?

1104
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,580
7 and a half. 13.

1105
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,022
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

1106
00:48:12,024 --> 00:48:13,189
Better than before.

1107
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:14,893
Yeah, the skip was really cool.

1108
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:19,129
Hey. Do you mind?
Bowler's etiquette.

1109
00:48:19,131 --> 00:48:21,162
- What do you mean?
- It means you're crowding me.

1110
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,067
What? You can't bowl
with me here?

1111
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,039
That sounded like a strike.

1112
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:35,948
How's your hearing?

1113
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:39,149
- Dylan, come on, buddy, you're up!
- All right.

1114
00:48:39,151 --> 00:48:41,984
Let's go. Hey, come on.
You can do this, okay?

1115
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:44,653
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's with the kiddie stuff?

1116
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:45,955
- What? The rails?
- Yeah.

1117
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,756
It's how the kids
learn how to bowl, Dad.

1118
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,626
You learn by fearing the gutter.

1119
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:51,327
Like in life, Dusty.

1120
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:54,997
Now, Kurt. The rails help a young
bowler build a positive self-image.

1121
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,966
Dylan, come here.

1122
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,901
Do you want to bowl
with those sissy rails up,

1123
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,306
or do you want to stand
and bowl like a man?

1124
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:04,874
I don't need the rails,
I guess.

1125
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:06,174
Attaboy! I'm proud of you, kid.

1126
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,077
Hey, I'm proud of you too,
big guy, all right?

1127
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,013
Dylan's going
without the rails.

1128
00:49:10,015 --> 00:49:12,481
No rails?
Whoo! All right, Dylan!

1129
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,816
Don't be afraid
to release it high.

1130
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,087
Here we go.

1131
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,655
Good try.

1132
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:21,156
When he's up there with the tears and
"I suck at everything" business,

1133
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,991
that's on you, Mr. School of
Hard Knocks.

1134
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,593
Hey, better than him
living in your basement

1135
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,164
in 20 years, Mr. Sissy Rails.

1136
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:31,600
Come on, buddy.
Give it another shot.

1137
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,638
Okay. New start, new beginning.
Here we go.

1138
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,144
Yay!

1139
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:42,981
Oh, yeah.

1140
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,392
Are we certain he understands
the game?

1141
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,995
He seems to almost be
trying to put it in the gutter.

1142
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,877
I know. He needs to get
more height on the ball.

1143
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:19,350
I hate this frickin' game!
It's so frickin' stupid!

1144
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,484
Hey, everybody, check it out!

1145
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,519
This kid's about to bowl
a perfect zero.

1146
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,523
Hey, mind your business!

1147
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,924
Hey, how do you think this is gonna
make him feel about himself?

1148
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,794
Well, this is character
building.

1149
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:33,796
Even the ridicule.

1150
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:35,432
- Come on, bud.
- Come on, Dylan!

1151
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:37,732
It's okay.

1152
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,602
I suck at everything!

1153
00:50:39,604 --> 00:50:41,673
I quit, I quit!

1154
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:45,077
Hey. Hey, kid, listen.

1155
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:50,013
We Mayron men might not always
show up.

1156
00:50:50,015 --> 00:50:52,080
I mean, we want to show up,
we intend to,

1157
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,082
but sometimes,
we get trashed the night before,

1158
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,551
or we wreck a speedboat,

1159
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,287
or hook up with
some Emirates flight attendants

1160
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,292
and somehow end up on a redeye
to Dubai.

1161
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,359
You know what I mean.

1162
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:05,394
The point is, we may not always
show up,

1163
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:08,430
but when we do, we finish what
we start.

1164
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,701
Now you get up there and grab
those balls.

1165
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,542
Come on, you got this.

1166
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,816
Go, bro!

1167
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,687
I'll take that.

1168
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,555
I'll cover that.

1169
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:35,560
Come on, honey!

1170
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:38,629
- Come on, buddy.
- You can do it, kid.

1171
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:53,044
Please. Please.

1172
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,295
Whoo! I did it!

1173
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,997
Thanks for believing in me,
El Padre!

1174
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,836
You bet, buddy! I knew you had
it in you!

1175
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,407
You're a winner!
You're a winner!

1176
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:25,410
I did it!

1177
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,417
Hey, where were you guys?

1178
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:35,785
We're almost at
the front of the line here.

1179
00:52:35,787 --> 00:52:38,486
We were at the Starbucks
checking out the local talent.

1180
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,990
Cute little number at the next
table was giving this one the eye.

1181
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,926
And El Padre got a phone number
from the lady who made the coffees.

1182
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:45,627
We got free ones!

1183
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,566
- I drink coffee now.
- What? Get in here.

1184
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:51,568
Big jump!

1185
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,069
Welcome to the North Pole!

1186
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,642
Hey, honey, are you sure you don't
want to go see Santa with the boys?

1187
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,245
You were so excited.

1188
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:05,283
Mom, Santa is so lame.

1189
00:53:06,151 --> 00:53:08,419
- Come on.
- He can hear you, you know!

1190
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,587
You know, I'm sorry...

1191
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:16,059
My daughter thinks that
your daughter is amazing.

1192
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:17,829
Oh, that's sweet.

1193
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,164
Which is cute, you're right,

1194
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,665
but sometimes when Adrianna
does certain things,

1195
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,704
then Megan thinks that it's okay
to do it because you said that...

1196
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,642
Oh, my God.

1197
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,410
Are you really stealing
right now?

1198
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,211
Sometimes I shoplift
a little bit.

1199
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,515
It's exciting!

1200
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:42,318
No! I mean... Okay, yeah,
it's a little exciting.

1201
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,218
My heart's really beating
out of my chest.

1202
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,354
What if we get caught?
You got to put it back!

1203
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,589
You're so obedient.

1204
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,491
You're always following
the rules, you know.

1205
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:50,392
Come on, Sara.

1206
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,861
Have a little fun with me.
Relax.

1207
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:53,897
I mean, I would love
to have a little fun with you,

1208
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:56,531
but I just want you to know,
I am not obedient, okay?

1209
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,167
- Then put this in your pants.
- No. No, thank you.

1210
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,437
And don't touch my boobs.
It's weird.

1211
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:04,040
Stop it!
I'm not going to shoplift!

1212
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:06,008
- Why not?
- Because...

1213
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,077
Because you're about to see why.

1214
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,678
- Pardon me, miss?
- Yes?

1215
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,847
- Is this woman bothering you?
- What?

1216
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:15,718
She's a little judgmental,
but she's fine. Thank you.

1217
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,254
No worries.

1218
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:26,495
Welcome to the North Pole!

1219
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:28,664
And what do you want for
Christmas?

1220
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,372
Oh, I didn't miss it. Hi!

1221
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:38,640
Right there.
This is a great shot.

1222
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,176
- Are you getting it, honey?
- Yeah, I got a good one.

1223
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,547
That's a great shot.

1224
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,212
Thank you, Santa.

1225
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,548
- You're welcome!
- Hi, honey.

1226
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,048
What about you, big brother?

1227
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,785
I'm sure you've been good.
What's on your list?

1228
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,821
I kind of want

1229
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:53,222
a 20-gauge shotgun,

1230
00:54:53,224 --> 00:54:54,957
so I can go turkey hunting
with my El Padre!

1231
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,624
What the heck?
Where'd he come up with that?

1232
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,859
Did he just ask for a firearm?

1233
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,028
Sure did! 20-gauge. Kid knows
his guns.

1234
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,863
Kurt, we've already been through
this. Dusty and I...

1235
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,865
Yeah, it is final. That's it.
It's not happening.

1236
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,035
Really? Because I don't remember
being part of that discussion.

1237
00:55:06,037 --> 00:55:09,705
Or am I just some little obedient wife
who does whatever the men folk say?

1238
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,807
Yeah, that doesn't seem quite
fair to me.

1239
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,674
Oh, piss off, Kurt.

1240
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,676
Honey, he's talking about a gun.

1241
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,379
If I may, can I just

1242
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:20,783
have a word with my grandson?

1243
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:24,486
I just want you to fully
understand what you're asking for.

1244
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:27,990
To take a gun into the
wilderness,

1245
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,559
find an animal living free,

1246
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,761
and take away its life.

1247
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,865
So that it can never
breathe or run

1248
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,633
or play ever again.

1249
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,736
Now, is that
what you really want?

1250
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,470
Yes.

1251
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,973
- No. I don't want to do that.
- Ah.

1252
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,109
You have a good heart, Dylan.

1253
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:48,977
I'll do it! I'll kill a turkey!

1254
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:50,714
Can I shoot one? Please?

1255
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:54,015
I'll have one shotgun, please,
Santa.

1256
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,818
And gobs and gobs of bullets.

1257
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,986
No, no, no, cupcake.
No, I'm sorry.

1258
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:01,926
No, the men do the hunting.
You ladies cook what we kill.

1259
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,495
Excuse me?

1260
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:07,062
Yeah, excuse you?

1261
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:09,064
Here, turkey, turkey, turkey!

1262
00:56:09,066 --> 00:56:10,298
Be patient, sweetheart.

1263
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,533
The decoys are right
around the corner.

1264
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:12,834
This is nice, huh, Dust?

1265
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,604
You and me, the fresh air.
Just like old times.

1266
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,071
What do you mean
"just like old times"?

1267
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,374
You only took me once, Dad.

1268
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,542
Jeez, I don't know.

1269
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:21,577
Are you sure this is a good
idea, Sara?

1270
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,511
Megan is a strong
independent woman.

1271
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,615
If she wants to help thin
the wild turkey population

1272
00:56:25,617 --> 00:56:27,816
so that they don't starve to
death in the winter,

1273
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,519
that is her right
by the Second Amendment.

1274
00:56:29,521 --> 00:56:31,519
Boy, you bought into
that real quick.

1275
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,055
I mean, I think for Megan,

1276
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,557
this is less about wildlife
conservation and more about bloodlust.

1277
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,593
Looks like somebody picked
the wrong day to be a turkey.

1278
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:41,263
Keep your elbow down
and cradle the stock, okay.

1279
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:42,330
Yeah, I get it.

1280
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,999
Can I shoot the damn thing
or not?

1281
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,600
Yeah, that's the spirit.

1282
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,202
Take a deep breath,

1283
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:50,675
and then squeeze that trigger
as you're letting it out.

1284
00:56:51,943 --> 00:56:53,908
Megan, are you sure
this is what you want to do?

1285
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,711
Let's name it.

1286
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,446
She's not gonna kill it if it
has a name.

1287
00:56:57,448 --> 00:57:00,182
- Yes! Gertrude.
- Sam? Tom?

1288
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:01,515
Billie Holiday! No.

1289
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:02,917
- Elijah.
- Elijah!

1290
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,854
- Elijah, run home!
- Stand your ground, kid.

1291
00:57:04,856 --> 00:57:05,720
Save yourself, Elijah!

1292
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,022
Take the shot, kid.
Take the shot.

1293
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,223
No, Elijah has feelings!

1294
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:09,491
Take the shot!

1295
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:12,597
Oh, God!

1296
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,028
Dad!

1297
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,332
Oh, my God. Honey, are you okay?

1298
00:57:16,334 --> 00:57:17,399
- Kurt!
- Dad, Dad, are you all right?

1299
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,767
I'm okay. She just winged me.

1300
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,336
I'm sorry, El Padre! I'm sorry.

1301
00:57:20,338 --> 00:57:22,937
That's okay, kid. I've been shot
worse than this plenty of times.

1302
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,707
Make your scarf
into a tourniquet.

1303
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:26,475
Wrap it around his shoulder.

1304
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:27,975
Lift his legs!

1305
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,147
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.
- I'm gonna bleed out.

1306
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,087
Wow.

1307
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,321
Two for two.

1308
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,591
Makes getting shot worth it.

1309
00:57:41,593 --> 00:57:43,292
Get the birds, Brad.

1310
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,493
God! I don't know
who this child is.

1311
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:46,964
You get that one.

1312
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,406
What? I know, okay?

1313
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:59,542
It's on me.
I'm the worst mom in the world.

1314
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:03,511
I put a gun in my daughter's hand,
and then she nearly killed somebody.

1315
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,816
She's gonna be scarred for life.

1316
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,482
Hi!

1317
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,484
I just shot a turkey and a man.

1318
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,189
Guess which one's dead.

1319
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,993
Okay, fine, maybe
she's a little too unscarred.

1320
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,030
Jeez.

1321
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,401
- You all right?
- Yeah, good.

1322
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:29,037
All right. So, listen, the doctor said
everything is gonna be all right.

1323
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,040
He just wants to keep you
for a couple of hours

1324
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:32,207
to watch your blood pressure.

1325
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,776
I'm fine. Where's my pants?

1326
00:58:33,778 --> 00:58:35,711
Hey. I forgot. Nothing ever
hurts you.

1327
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,278
Why don't we just round up all
the nurses?

1328
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,381
We can bring them in here.

1329
00:58:38,383 --> 00:58:39,582
You could do some
pushups for them,

1330
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:40,749
maybe bench press the couch
a little bit,

1331
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:41,984
prove you're still a tough guy.

1332
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,319
Still tough enough to lick you, Junior.

1333
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:45,586
- Was that a scoff?
- I didn't scoff.

1334
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:46,854
Yeah, I heard you scoff just
then.

1335
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,089
All right, I scoffed. So what?

1336
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,792
Why, because you think
you can lick me, right?

1337
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:51,593
I never said I could lick you,
but I could whoop you for sure.

1338
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:52,761
Now we're talking!

1339
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,196
Come on. Best out of three
falls, come on.

1340
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,763
Hey, cut it out, okay? I'm not
gonna wrestle an old man

1341
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:57,600
whose ass is hanging out
of his hospital gown.

1342
00:58:57,602 --> 00:58:58,934
Greco-Roman style. Best way.
Come on.

1343
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,269
Hey, Great Santini, I'm not
gonna do this, all right?

1344
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,039
- Cut it out. Get some rest.
- All right.

1345
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,640
Hey!

1346
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,674
That's one, candy-ass.

1347
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,444
Now you're gonna get whipped,
old man.

1348
00:59:08,446 --> 00:59:09,714
Come on. Bring it on.

1349
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:17,285
- Tap out!
- Nah. I can keep going all night, kid.

1350
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,622
You hear that heart rate?
You can set your watch to it.

1351
00:59:19,624 --> 00:59:21,524
Yeah. 'Cause ice water
only flows at one speed, huh?

1352
00:59:21,526 --> 00:59:23,292
That's right, pal.
Now go to sleep.

1353
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:25,974
You know I came in to say something
nice, but now you can forget it.

1354
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,897
What nice thing?

1355
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:29,031
No. Forget it.

1356
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:31,332
You know,
when that gun went off,

1357
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,501
I thought you were a goner.

1358
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:33,702
There's something that we never
say that

1359
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,344
one of us should say before it's
too late.

1360
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:39,508
Yeah? Like... Like what?

1361
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,044
No, I'm not gonna say it now, but
maybe you want to say something.

1362
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,145
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, yeah?

1363
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,714
Seems like you might want to
get something off your chest.

1364
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,783
No. Nothing comes to mind.

1365
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,017
But if you want to say
something,

1366
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,486
I'm not gonna stop you or
anything.

1367
00:59:50,488 --> 00:59:51,553
No, I'm good.

1368
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:52,720
But you might wanna
unburden yourself

1369
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,089
before you bust
that frickin' machine.

1370
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,559
Yeah. Well, if I was gonna say
something, and I'm not...

1371
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:58,761
What are you gonna say?

1372
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:00,328
But if I was, I might want to
tell you that I...

1373
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,830
Hello?

1374
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:02,631
Wait, it's Brad! Don't...
Don't say it! Don't say it.

1375
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:03,765
Knock, knock!

1376
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,033
Time out on three, okay?
One, two, three.

1377
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:06,037
Hey, Brad.

1378
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:07,836
What's going on?

1379
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,638
Hey. Am I interrupting
something?

1380
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,307
- What? No, nothing.
- No, we're fine.

1381
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:12,506
Why are you being so weird,
Brad?

1382
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,142
Just seems
a little awkward in here.

1383
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,211
Oh, gosh.
It smells like a bullfight.

1384
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,814
So, look, guys,

1385
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:20,982
I'm not here to tell you I told
you so,

1386
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,019
even though I did.

1387
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,319
I've just been thinking that

1388
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,687
we've had a lot of tensions
as of late, and I thought

1389
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,124
maybe we could use
a Dads' Night Out. Right?

1390
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,660
Yeah. So what are we thinking,
Brad?

1391
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,160
Strip club?

1392
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,531
Even better.

1393
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:39,334
Look, it's a cute tiny monkey
on your back.

1394
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:46,143
Give us all the money in the
drawers and all the lollipops.

1395
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,849
Guys, I can't keep up.

1396
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:02,557
I'm gonna hit the head.

1397
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,359
- I'll get us a couple more drinks.
- Sure.

1398
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:06,961
Hey, am I crazy or are you guys
having a good time?

1399
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,564
I don't know.
I think we kind of are.

1400
01:01:08,566 --> 01:01:11,533
- That's wonderful, Dusty!
- Thanks, Don.

1401
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:13,468
I told you we'd rub off
on you two.

1402
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,236
In this room right now,

1403
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,506
there's a man who,
despite his advancing years,

1404
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,845
is apparently an improv ninja.

1405
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:23,011
Brad, you didn't.

1406
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,781
I did. I so did!

1407
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:28,182
Don Whitaker, ladies and
gentlemen!

1408
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,651
All right. All right.

1409
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,658
You are the greatest.

1410
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:39,261
Don!
Let's hear it for Don!

1411
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:40,828
We're gonna play
a little "Arms Akimbo."

1412
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,997
Do you know that one?

1413
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:43,332
- Of course I do!
- Awesome.

1414
01:01:43,334 --> 01:01:44,665
They're gonna love this.

1415
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,602
- Can somebody do my Velcro?
- Yes.

1416
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:49,604
He's got tiny little girl arms!

1417
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,809
Okay. We're gonna do a scene,
and we need some suggestions.

1418
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,511
Can you suggest an animal?

1419
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:57,912
- Raccoon!
- A panda!

1420
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,781
Raccoon, good! All right.

1421
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:01,783
And, sir, what is your
profession?

1422
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:03,184
I'm a dermatologist.

1423
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,388
And finally we need
a human relationship.

1424
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:07,522
Oh! Father and son!

1425
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,357
A healthy father and son
relationship.

1426
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,961
Or how about a divorce?

1427
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,129
Now you're getting in the
spirit, Dusty.

1428
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,464
Yes. Okay. We're taking
"divorce."

1429
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:16,731
That's all we need. Give it up!

1430
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,436
That's really dark.

1431
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,135
Oh, come on, babe.

1432
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:21,903
Just a little fun before
he gets here.

1433
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,138
No. Stop it. I told you, okay?

1434
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,841
No canoodling until
the divorce is finalized.

1435
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:27,712
- It's not right.
- Come on.

1436
01:02:28,146 --> 01:02:29,245
Knock, knock.

1437
01:02:29,247 --> 01:02:32,316
He has no idea what
he's walking into!

1438
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:35,116
You're home!

1439
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,254
Yes.

1440
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,423
Where were you?

1441
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:43,057
I took our raccoon to the
dermatologist.

1442
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,626
He got two
of the suggestions already.

1443
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,127
He's on fire!

1444
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,397
Aren't you even gonna address
the strange man in your home?

1445
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:51,667
Yeah, bro, don't you even
want to know who I am?

1446
01:02:51,669 --> 01:02:53,401
I know who you are.

1447
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:55,136
Don, if you'll excuse me,

1448
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,140
I think I'm gonna start
giving it to your wife.

1449
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,673
Shut up!

1450
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:01,410
Just shut up with
that kind of talk!

1451
01:03:01,412 --> 01:03:04,412
When we met on that flight,
I was really nice to you.

1452
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:08,816
I listened to you tell your
stupid story over and over again,

1453
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,187
and I complimented your hat!

1454
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,792
- Brad, we have to stop this.
- He's killing!

1455
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,026
Don't you see what's happening?

1456
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:20,028
I do. I see a room of people
laughing at my father.

1457
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,162
- It's amazing.
- Okay.

1458
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:24,301
- Have some water.
- No, I don't want water.

1459
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,636
Oh!

1460
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,772
I don't want water!

1461
01:03:29,774 --> 01:03:31,540
I want my wife back.

1462
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:35,676
And I want our Sunday brunches
at the Cracker Barrel.

1463
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:38,080
Braddie, we've got to get him
off the stage.

1464
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:40,952
All you needed was
somebody to listen to you,

1465
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,752
and all I do is talk.

1466
01:03:43,754 --> 01:03:45,086
On and on and on.

1467
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:48,993
When am I ever gonna learn
to shut my big fat mouth?

1468
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:50,528
Ooh.

1469
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:52,163
Ginny.

1470
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,966
Ginny.

1471
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,198
My sweet Ginny.

1472
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,870
Why is he using
my mom's real name?

1473
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,940
Hey, Dad?

1474
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:06,277
Is this true?

1475
01:04:07,778 --> 01:04:09,781
Are you and Mom divorced?

1476
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,850
I wanted to tell you, Brad.

1477
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:20,424
Son, you're home
from summer camp!

1478
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,128
I don't go to summer camp,
I'm a grown man. Okay?

1479
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,832
Why are you laughing?
I'm not part of this! Okay?

1480
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:35,370
You are a part of this family, and
you will respect your parents.

1481
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,504
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

1482
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:37,604
- Brad.
- Just shut up.

1483
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:38,973
Let me out of this bit!

1484
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,975
What about him?
Is he still around?

1485
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,877
Do I have a stepdad?

1486
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:47,918
Stop doing that to me!
I'm a paying customer!

1487
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,053
Brad, let's go.

1488
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:52,824
Come on.

1489
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,332
Will you please just go out
there and talk to him?

1490
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:08,102
He won't talk to me,
and I don't blame him.

1491
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,440
You know, it's not really all
your fault.

1492
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,441
You can't blame Dusty.

1493
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:17,080
He couldn't have known about Ginny and
me when he made that improv suggestion.

1494
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,850
- You did know!
- It was pretty obvious, Don.

1495
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,618
A guy your age either joins
an improv group

1496
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,019
because his wife left him,

1497
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,754
or his wife left him because he
joined an improv group.

1498
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,790
- So you did it on purpose?
- No! Well...

1499
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,459
Well, yeah. All right? I did.

1500
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,794
You and Brad are all lovey-dovey
and smug about your relationship.

1501
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,196
I mean, you make out every
chance you get.

1502
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,897
Meanwhile, my dad's ditching out
on me.

1503
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,432
Maybe I got a little jealous,
all right?

1504
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,002
Look, I didn't think
you were gonna freak out

1505
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:42,336
and spill your guts to a room
full of drunken skiers!

1506
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,305
- Hey. What is wrong with you?
- What? I didn't...

1507
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,140
Go out there
and fix this right now.

1508
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,445
- Go!
- All right.

1509
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:53,749
Are you serious?

1510
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:55,051
I'm keeping this.

1511
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:18,575
Are you okay?

1512
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:21,245
Uh...

1513
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,912
My parents are divorced.

1514
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:25,316
Oh. Mine, too.

1515
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:27,082
Sucks.

1516
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:29,850
- Yeah.
- I think it was my fault.

1517
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:33,522
- Was yours your fault, too?
- I don't know. I hope not.

1518
01:06:33,524 --> 01:06:35,923
I just found out last night.
When did you find out?

1519
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:38,660
- I was a baby.
- When you were a baby?

1520
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:41,432
Maybe it was your fault.
Were you a difficult baby?

1521
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,665
I don't know.

1522
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,535
You know what? Your lack of specifics
leads me to believe it was your fault.

1523
01:06:46,537 --> 01:06:49,236
No, no, no! You were not
a difficult baby, sweetheart.

1524
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,939
Brad, dude, what are you
telling the kid?

1525
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:53,274
Come on, man. I know
you're upset about last night.

1526
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:54,943
All right? I'm sorry
about what happened, okay?

1527
01:06:54,945 --> 01:06:56,410
I didn't mean to give
that improv suggestion.

1528
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,345
It just... It just kind of
slipped out.

1529
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:01,917
- Know what, Dusty? It's okay.
- Really?

1530
01:07:01,919 --> 01:07:03,584
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Brad.

1531
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,921
Look, why don't you come in and talk
to Don? He's feeling a little...

1532
01:07:05,923 --> 01:07:08,125
Oh, my gosh.
I wonder who that could be?

1533
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:10,428
What a nice truck!

1534
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,468
Daddy!

1535
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:23,303
- What are you doing here?
- Come on. What am I doing?

1536
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,640
I want to celebrate Christmas
with my perfect little girl.

1537
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:29,077
Don't you want to spend the holidays
with your one true real dad?

1538
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,444
Yeah, come on!

1539
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,381
- Let's come see the cabin.
- Hey, Roger.

1540
01:07:32,383 --> 01:07:33,684
It's so cool!

1541
01:07:35,986 --> 01:07:37,118
Come on, hurry.
You're going too slow.

1542
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,486
I'm coming, sweetheart.

1543
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:40,955
You invite him all the way up
here just to get back at me?

1544
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,258
Yeah, I did.

1545
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:47,428
- Bye, Kurt! Call me!
- Yeah, next time I'm in.

1546
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,062
That's her dad, yeah?

1547
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:51,299
Uh-huh.

1548
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:52,834
And you invited him,
too, didn't you?

1549
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:54,368
I sure did, yep.

1550
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:59,339
I don't know what I missed,
but this is getting good, boys.

1551
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,575
- I like your style, Brad.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1552
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,948
You're opening up the harbor,
Brad.

1553
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:08,482
The harbor is wide open,
and it's Fleet Week!

1554
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,885
All right, good. 'Cause I got a
few boats that want to set sail.

1555
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:11,986
Yeah, good. So do I.

1556
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,655
You favor little Griffy
over my kids.

1557
01:08:13,657 --> 01:08:14,957
What? I do not!

1558
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:16,290
He gets to sleep in your bed
all the time.

1559
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,424
Megan and Dylan never get to.

1560
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,127
You want them to sleep
in my bed with me?

1561
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,029
God, no! Don't you ever think
about it!

1562
01:08:21,031 --> 01:08:22,297
I'm not thinking about it!

1563
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,464
- You brought it up.
- Good! You better not.

1564
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:24,866
- Shut up!
- Hey, you shut up.

1565
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:26,668
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

1566
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,270
Okay. Well, he's not gonna be part of that
special thing we got planned tonight,

1567
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,570
if that's what you're thinking.

1568
01:08:30,572 --> 01:08:32,074
Oh, yeah?
So you're gonna tell Adrianna

1569
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:33,607
that everyone's invited
to that "special thing"

1570
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,612
we have planned for tonight,
except her dad.

1571
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:16,450
Hey. Five more minutes
and I get to be Joseph.

1572
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:19,320
You're not the right type
to play Jesus' dad, Brad.

1573
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:22,323
He wasn't Jesus' dad,
he was Jesus' stepdad.

1574
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,260
And I'm exactly the right type.

1575
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:26,261
You'd better stop hitting me

1576
01:09:26,263 --> 01:09:27,628
with that shepherd stick, Brad.
I'm warning you.

1577
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:29,631
Brad's right.
Let him be Joseph.

1578
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:31,065
Thank you, Roger, I appreciate
that.

1579
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:32,499
It's Brad's turn, Dusty.

1580
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,302
Dad, don't break character.

1581
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:35,637
And stop trying to butter me up.

1582
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,440
- Can we show some decorum?
- I'm showing decorum.

1583
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:40,743
You guys, zip it!
You're gonna wake up Baby Jesus.

1584
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,445
That's it. Give me the beard.

1585
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,114
Don't touch my Joseph beard,
Brad!

1586
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,449
- Give him the beard!
- Dad, stay out of it!

1587
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,084
Can we have some respect for the
Nativity?

1588
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:51,453
Cut it out!

1589
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:54,422
This is stupid.
I don't even get it.

1590
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:57,292
Why go on a trip when
Mary's about to have a baby?

1591
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,659
What's so damn important

1592
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,962
you got to go to Bethlehem
in the middle of the night?

1593
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:03,163
There was a census, okay? We
covered that in Sunday School.

1594
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,335
Megan, what is going...

1595
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:07,968
Did you get into the eggnog?

1596
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,271
Hey. Who's up for some IHOP?

1597
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:10,771
Yeah, that kid's pickled all
right.

1598
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,143
Mom, you're pretty.
Can we go to IHOP?

1599
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:14,976
I'm sorry, folks.

1600
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:16,611
Having some technical
difficulties.

1601
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:19,980
Great, Dad. Now you've broken
the fourth wall!

1602
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,848
None of it's real, folks.

1603
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,251
I want to go wait in the car.

1604
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,153
Give me the keys, Brad!

1605
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:27,355
No, I am not giving you
the keys to the car,

1606
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:29,557
because you're drunk
and you're a child.

1607
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:34,229
Nobody likes your dumb,
stupid Brad voice.

1608
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:36,097
And you smell like pumpkins!

1609
01:10:36,099 --> 01:10:38,565
- And you're a mean drunk.
- Kid's got an arm.

1610
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,269
Drunk nine-year-old.
Real nice parenting.

1611
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,840
You better watch it, Roger.

1612
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,007
Adrianna! Are you okay,
sweetheart?

1613
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,449
Is she okay? Is she...
What is she...

1614
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,181
Oh. What a shock. Now we
know where Megan got the eggnog.

1615
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,949
You always assume
she's the bad influence.

1616
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,485
Maybe your daughter plied
my daughter with alcohol.

1617
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:00,588
Maybe your daughter's that way
because her mother is a shoplifter.

1618
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,656
Shoplifter.

1619
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,726
Sara, we've been working on
the shoplifting thing, okay?

1620
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:06,328
But that has nothing
to do with Adrianna

1621
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,529
being such a little nightmare
all the time.

1622
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:08,963
My daughter is not a nightmare!

1623
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:10,097
Come on, Adrianna.

1624
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,333
No, sweetheart,
I didn't mean that.

1625
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:13,066
- Honey!
- Hey.

1626
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,736
- What'd you call my daughter?
- He called her a nightmare.

1627
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,939
Hey. I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a heathen.

1628
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,040
Let's take this outside.

1629
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,408
Yeah, let's step
outside the manger.

1630
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,609
He called her a nightmare.

1631
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,744
- Here we go.
- Now, now, boys,

1632
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:25,413
we can't just leave!

1633
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:28,281
Joseph and the Innkeeper
rumble outside the manger!

1634
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:29,818
Make the first move, Innkeeper.

1635
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:30,985
Kick his ass, Joseph!

1636
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:33,154
We are not going to do this
in front of the children!

1637
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:35,623
Now, what kind of fathers are
you, anyway?

1638
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,792
That's rich!

1639
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:39,793
Coming from a guy who lies to
his son for six months.

1640
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,931
Maybe that's why everyone thinks
your stories are so "delightful,"

1641
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:44,799
because they're all lies!

1642
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:46,467
Sara, get the kids out of here,
okay?

1643
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:49,637
Happily. I don't want them
watching this anyway.

1644
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,539
Have fun, morons!

1645
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:54,476
- Pancakes, bitches!
- Do not say "bitches."

1646
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:55,677
Kids are gone. Let's go.

1647
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,913
I'm not hitting a guy dressed
like Joseph.

1648
01:11:57,915 --> 01:11:59,247
The beard's off, Roger.

1649
01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:00,914
How many excuses
you want to pull out, man?

1650
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:01,982
Now it's on.

1651
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,584
- You know what, Brad?
- Don!

1652
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:04,785
Yes, I lied!

1653
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,989
Because whenever there's
anything wrong in your life,

1654
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,024
if it isn't roses and rainbows,

1655
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,592
you completely fall apart.

1656
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:13,660
I thought we had an honest
relationship!

1657
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,262
Oh, yeah? Brad,
I bet you never told him

1658
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,265
about that procedure
you had last year, did you?

1659
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:18,533
Oh, my God. What procedure?

1660
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,936
It was nothing,
just some benign tissue.

1661
01:12:20,938 --> 01:12:24,070
How about that? You're both a
couple of lying sacks.

1662
01:12:24,072 --> 01:12:25,239
And, you!

1663
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:26,473
From the minute you got here,

1664
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,944
you've been nothing but
mean and sarcastic.

1665
01:12:28,946 --> 01:12:30,278
Well, you know what, Kurt?

1666
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,012
- F you!
- Dad!

1667
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,614
That's right. Forget you!

1668
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:35,949
Attaboy, swami.
Throwing down F words.

1669
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,918
Not the F word, but an F word,
and that's a good start.

1670
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,055
Now, come on, give me the
finger, big boy. Come on.

1671
01:12:40,057 --> 01:12:41,556
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey!

1672
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,491
Are we gonna still fight
or what?

1673
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,760
Roger brings up a good point.
Let's get the momentum back.

1674
01:12:45,762 --> 01:12:48,329
Come on, Roger. Get some!
Let's get in there!

1675
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:50,765
- Come on!
- No, no, no, no, no!

1676
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:54,636
If you lay one hand on each other,
whether the kids are here or not,

1677
01:12:54,638 --> 01:12:57,437
it will negatively impact them.

1678
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,910
All right.
I'm not gonna lay a hand on him.

1679
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:03,244
What are you doing?

1680
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,846
Oh. Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.
Snowball fight.

1681
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,917
I've got some Nerf guns
in the back of my car.

1682
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:10,150
Want me to get them?

1683
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,320
I pitched triple-A for the Red
Sox in their farm system, Roger.

1684
01:13:12,322 --> 01:13:13,387
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1685
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,591
Take your best shot.

1686
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,061
Dad!

1687
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,598
Don, I'm sorry!

1688
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,466
That sucks.

1689
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,537
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it was all right.

1690
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,074
Hey, no fair.
That's an ice ball.

1691
01:13:32,076 --> 01:13:33,374
You bet it is.

1692
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:35,275
You know, you throw that
and we are no longer co-dads.

1693
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:36,544
I'm way ahead of you, dickhead.

1694
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:37,712
You know, from now on,

1695
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:39,213
we'll just act like
a normal blended family

1696
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:40,280
with me hating your guts.

1697
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,982
The kids will never know,

1698
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,151
because I'm too good of a dad to ever
throw their stepfather under the bus.

1699
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,187
But that's right where
you're gonna be, Brad.

1700
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:47,855
Under my bus.

1701
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:50,857
Well, guess what, I'm gonna celebrate
you morning, noon and night

1702
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:53,394
because it's the right thing to
do in front of the kids.

1703
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:55,396
But just know the way
I really feel about you

1704
01:13:55,398 --> 01:13:57,598
is you can suck a fart, Dusty.

1705
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,504
A wet, greasy fart.

1706
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,940
You gonna keep pump-faking that thing
or you gonna take a shot, Brad?

1707
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,275
Huh?

1708
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:10,544
What? What? Huh?

1709
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,213
He's never played sports ever.

1710
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:14,047
Maybe it's stuck to his hand.

1711
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,051
Oh! Oh!

1712
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,388
Huh? Huh?

1713
01:14:25,262 --> 01:14:26,660
That's what I thought.

1714
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,262
You know what, Dusty,
you're not worth it.

1715
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:29,864
Come on, Dad.

1716
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:30,765
Good.

1717
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,169
Psych. You're totally worth it!

1718
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,069
Dad!

1719
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:39,306
- That was an ice ball.
- Treating your dad like that!

1720
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,641
Dad.

1721
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,545
Look, it was an accident.

1722
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:47,347
Go ahead, Roger.

1723
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,951
Brad was right the first time.

1724
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:51,522
You're not worth it.

1725
01:14:53,357 --> 01:14:55,457
Dang! Right down my neck!

1726
01:14:55,459 --> 01:14:56,894
Don! Sorry! Sorry!

1727
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:00,593
That guy's like a snowball
magnet.

1728
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,765
You were right about everything.
You happy now?

1729
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,365
Dusty,

1730
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:07,437
I do like being right.

1731
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,173
Hey, is that
your baby in there?

1732
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,240
Griffy!

1733
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:18,346
I know. I know, sweetie.
It's okay, it's okay.

1734
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:19,946
I know, I know.

1735
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:23,019
This was Dusty's idea.
I never wanted to do this.

1736
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,859
Hey, Brad. That one's mine.

1737
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,862
- Oh, is this bag yours?
- Yeah.

1738
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,704
Sara? Sara!

1739
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:37,124
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ew.

1740
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:38,961
What is going on here?

1741
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,565
What's happening, Officer?

1742
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,834
Avalanche hit the highway
up ahead.

1743
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,637
It's gonna take a few hours to
clear it,

1744
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:51,105
so follow the traffic back
into town, all right?

1745
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,740
What caused the avalanche?
Was it all the snow?

1746
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:54,876
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

1747
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:57,345
snow had something to do
with the avalanche.

1748
01:16:57,347 --> 01:16:59,049
Keep it moving!

1749
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:06,654
Well, I guess we could stop
and have lunch to kill time.

1750
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,721
On Christmas Day?

1751
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:10,525
What's gonna be open?

1752
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,762
I don't know.

1753
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:20,135
Oh, look at that!

1754
01:17:20,137 --> 01:17:22,104
Looks like everyone
had the same idea.

1755
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,584
Oh, no.
Everything's sold out.

1756
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:38,852
Well, I guess we could see
<i>Missile Tow.</i>

1757
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,154
What's that about?

1758
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,422
It's Liam Neeson.

1759
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:43,958
He's a tow truck driver who's on
his way home for Christmas

1760
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,694
with his kids and
happens along some terrorists

1761
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:48,529
who've hijacked a mobile ICBM.

1762
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,797
So he hooks it to his rig

1763
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:51,699
and has to get it to NORAD
before Christmas morning.

1764
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:53,334
I hear it's really good!

1765
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:55,836
I don't know, Brad, it's PG-13.

1766
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,839
I don't really care
for the salty language.

1767
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,274
Well, it has cute
little kids in it.

1768
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:01,374
I mean, how dirty can it be?

1769
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,610
Besides, you love Liam Neeson.

1770
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:03,677
I do.

1771
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,413
- Let's just give it a shot.
- Yes!

1772
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:06,713
Looks very heroic.

1773
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:09,218
- I'll say that much.
- I mean, really. Man!

1774
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:13,687
The front row? I don't know,
Brad.

1775
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,288
- What about the...
- Dad, please stop!

1776
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,457
It's gonna strain your eyes.

1777
01:18:16,459 --> 01:18:17,961
We don't have a choice,
all right?

1778
01:18:19,629 --> 01:18:21,365
Look, it's Mom and Brad!

1779
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,939
<i>Santa's got
a present for you bastards.</i>

1780
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,912
<i>You're impounded, asshole.</i>

1781
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:40,213
<i>- You did it, Daddy!
- You killed them all.</i>

1782
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,583
<i>No, kids.
We did it. We killed them all.</i>

1783
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:44,785
<i>Together.</i>

1784
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:46,686
<i>We love you, Daddy.</i>

1785
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,588
<i>I love you, too.</i>

1786
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:51,762
<i>The only thing that matters
to me in this crazy world</i>

1787
01:18:52,195 --> 01:18:54,162
<i>is you kids.</i>

1788
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:56,497
<i>And I'm sorry that your
holiday was ruined</i>

1789
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:58,665
<i>by those godless mother...</i>

1790
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:06,339
Sorry, folks.

1791
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,074
Looks like we're having
a bit of a power outage.

1792
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,311
We don't know when
the power's gonna come back on,

1793
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,047
so you guys are all welcome
to stay in here or in the lobby.

1794
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:15,716
The DOT wants everybody to stay
inside and off the roads,

1795
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:17,287
so we might be in here
for a while.

1796
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:22,256
You know, I bet this is
because of the snow, too.

1797
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,393
Gee, Dad, you think so?

1798
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,718
I need to use the gent's.

1799
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,186
Brad, do you need to go tee-tee?

1800
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,855
Dad, don't say that in public!

1801
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:56,125
- Just go.
- All right.

1802
01:19:58,495 --> 01:19:59,729
Is he still looking at me?

1803
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,629
Yes.

1804
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,901
Is he doing that one look that
he does? You know, like...

1805
01:20:06,836 --> 01:20:08,936
- Is he doing that look?
- Yeah.

1806
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:11,208
Where he doesn't blink? Yeah.

1807
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:13,777
Yep.

1808
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:15,810
You know,

1809
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:17,211
when I said that

1810
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:19,680
Brad was turning you into
something that you're not?

1811
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:22,615
Maybe, you know,
what I really meant to say

1812
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,418
was that

1813
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:27,156
Brad's turning you
into something that I'm not,

1814
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:29,022
a good dad.

1815
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:32,126
No? No, that didn't
do it for you?

1816
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:33,327
Come on.
I thought it was pretty good.

1817
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,229
That whole speech
was in the movie we just saw.

1818
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:36,663
- Was it?
- Yeah. Word for word.

1819
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:37,964
Dramatic pauses and all.

1820
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:39,132
Liam Neeson just said that.

1821
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,802
It must've been in my
subconscious.

1822
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:43,169
I'm gonna go drain the lizard.

1823
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,174
Yeah. Yeah.

1824
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,779
Whoa!
That is a very impressive

1825
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:54,317
watch. Is that a Rolex?
Mine's a Casio.

1826
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:06,293
You know what, Kurt?

1827
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:07,227
When we first met,

1828
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,097
I was so excited about
our being co-grandpas.

1829
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:13,436
And now everybody's miserable!
And my son won't forgive me.

1830
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:16,305
You know what you and Brad
really need?

1831
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,772
Oh, no.

1832
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:21,574
I'm not taking any advice
from the likes of you.

1833
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:22,845
No, thank you.

1834
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:27,917
Okay, what do we need?

1835
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:33,253
- Hey! Adrianna's here!
- Megan!

1836
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,387
Hi!

1837
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:37,057
- I can't shake this guy.
- I can't shake this guy.

1838
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,559
- You guys got stuck here, too?
- Yeah.

1839
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:42,262
And, Dylan, look who else
got stuck. Your girlfriend!

1840
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:43,698
We should put her under
the mistletoe.

1841
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,765
Yeah!

1842
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,937
- Come on, stay under.
- Stay.

1843
01:21:49,839 --> 01:21:52,042
You like that girl, don't you?

1844
01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:53,844
Hmm.

1845
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,176
Well,

1846
01:21:55,178 --> 01:21:58,579
who knocked down a pin
all by himself?

1847
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,713
- I did?
- Damn right, you did.

1848
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,784
Now go in there
and pick up that spare.

1849
01:22:02,786 --> 01:22:04,621
Here she is, Dylan!

1850
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:07,557
It just doesn't seem right.

1851
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,223
Brad?

1852
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:12,629
Dad, I really don't want to...

1853
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:14,529
Jeez.

1854
01:22:14,531 --> 01:22:17,498
We're gonna settle this
physically, like men!

1855
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,967
And when it's all over, we're
gonna feel a whole lot better.

1856
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:22,102
At least somebody's
taking my advice today.

1857
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,803
Cut it out! This is child abuse!
Honey, help me!

1858
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:25,405
Don't be such a snowflake.
Fight back!

1859
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:26,673
Hey, guys, come on,
knock it off.

1860
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:27,740
You're making a scene,
all right?

1861
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,042
Yeah, Don, lean on him!

1862
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,581
Engage me, son,
for the sake of our male bond.

1863
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,517
No, wait, wait, look. Look!

1864
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:41,992
What's he doing?

1865
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,797
Oh, my God. He's going in
for his first kiss.

1866
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:51,397
Look, she's standing
under the mistletoe.

1867
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,066
Oh, my God. Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?

1868
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,735
Oh, my God, where's your phone?

1869
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:56,037
Brad, where's your phone!

1870
01:22:56,039 --> 01:22:59,172
Okay, it's right here.
Right here. Yeah. Yeah.

1871
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,610
Look how brave he is.
She's all yours, buddy.

1872
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:04,012
Unless she's
got a boyfriend.

1873
01:23:04,014 --> 01:23:05,312
In that case,
there's always the Friend Zone.

1874
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,547
No, there's nothing wrong
with the Friend Zone.

1875
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:07,714
Guys, he's not going
in the Friend Zone, okay?

1876
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:08,781
Look at that smile.
She likes him.

1877
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,487
Yeah, she wants a kiss.

1878
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,012
My God, he kissed his sister!

1879
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,716
Congratulations, you lucky gal.

1880
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,818
I did it, El Padre!
I kissed the girl I like!

1881
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:47,888
Yeah! Attaboy!

1882
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:51,292
Did you just kiss your sister?
You sick kid!

1883
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,360
Stepsister.

1884
01:23:52,362 --> 01:23:54,128
I mean, still not okay,
I know that.

1885
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,163
What? No, no, wait, he's just
a little confused, all right?

1886
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:57,864
It's no surprise
when you look at who raised him.

1887
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,632
Adrianna, come on.
We're going home.

1888
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:01,601
Wait, wait, Roger,
you can't go out in that storm.

1889
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:04,672
I was an alternate for Season 3
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

1890
01:24:04,674 --> 01:24:05,675
I'll be fine.

1891
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:08,578
That was their best season.

1892
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,945
I got this.

1893
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:12,445
Wait a minute.
Roger, hold up, man.

1894
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:15,182
No. From now on, I don't want
you anywhere near my daughter.

1895
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:16,917
I don't want anything to do
with any of you people!

1896
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:19,052
Look, I never wanted to be
family with you, either, Roger.

1897
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,821
Just like Brad never wanted to be
family with me, did you, Brad?

1898
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,557
No. Not at all. I hated your
guts.

1899
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,726
In fact, I still kind of do
right now.

1900
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,060
Yeah. Me, too, Brad.

1901
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,796
But we're all connected
by these kids.

1902
01:24:28,798 --> 01:24:30,230
No one's going anywhere.

1903
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,165
- You gonna stop me?
- If I have to, yes.

1904
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,437
Yeah, right. You couldn't stop
a clock, you weak tit.

1905
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,039
The hammer.

1906
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:41,674
You know what, Adrianna?

1907
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:45,081
You're not gonna like this, young
lady, but this is long overdue.

1908
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:49,486
I love you.

1909
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:53,119
- That got me.
- Got me, too. Right here.

1910
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:54,355
What the hell did you just say?

1911
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:55,855
You heard me.
I said, I love my stepdaughter!

1912
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,159
And I meant it. I should've said
it a long time ago,

1913
01:24:58,161 --> 01:25:02,165
but I was afraid to put myself out
there and risk getting rejected.

1914
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:03,631
Sweet.

1915
01:25:03,633 --> 01:25:05,466
You know what?

1916
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:08,171
Adrianna, you're gonna spend
Christmas with your mom, okay?

1917
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:12,306
You're not leaving us, Roger.

1918
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:14,044
'Cause I love you, too.

1919
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:18,279
- You take that back!
- Nope. I can't.

1920
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:19,413
Can't take it back now.

1921
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:21,381
Everybody heard it.
It's out there.

1922
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:24,252
- Everybody hear it?
- Yeah.

1923
01:25:24,254 --> 01:25:25,919
You're her dad,
you made her who she is,

1924
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:29,089
and despite her currently harboring a
fair amount of resentment towards me,

1925
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:31,324
I love her, so that means
I love you, too.

1926
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,293
And I've never been too good
about saying it,

1927
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:34,995
but I'm gonna follow Brad's
example,

1928
01:25:34,997 --> 01:25:36,263
who I also love.

1929
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:38,498
Now you're just saying things
to choke me up.

1930
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,600
Brad! Cut it out.

1931
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:41,735
- I'm trying.
- I'm a hot mess here.

1932
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:43,503
- Don, please!
- You've got to understand,

1933
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,539
when it comes out of nowhere
like that,

1934
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:46,440
what do you expect?

1935
01:25:46,442 --> 01:25:47,708
- Stop!
- I'm stopping.

1936
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,209
- I'm currently stopping.
- We're...

1937
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:51,544
Yeah, guys. Cut it out,
you're embarrassing me.

1938
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:52,913
I love you, Brad.

1939
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,716
And I love Karen, I love Sara,

1940
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:56,718
and I love my kids.

1941
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:01,524
I...

1942
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,760
I might need a little more
time with that one.

1943
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:07,928
Sure, understood.

1944
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:09,863
But we're making progress.
Maybe for your birthday.

1945
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:11,030
Yeah.

1946
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:12,866
You know. Unless you
want to say anything?

1947
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:14,502
- Anything at all?
- Say it, Kurt.

1948
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:16,503
- Now's the time.
- Just say it, Kurt.

1949
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:17,637
You want to say anything?

1950
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:19,440
It's not that bad.
Just say it.

1951
01:26:19,442 --> 01:26:22,110
- You can do it.
- Do it.

1952
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:25,012
Nah, the birthday's a good
target. Good target.

1953
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,913
All right, Roger,

1954
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,719

2022
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,021
We're not gonna see them again
till Easter,

2023
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:03,757
so everybody say good-bye
to El Padre and Pop-Pop.

2024
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:05,659
- Bye, Dylan.
- Good-bye, El Padre!

2025
01:31:05,661 --> 01:31:07,026
Hey, next time you want
to shoot a guy,

2026
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:10,029
don't just wing him,
go for center mass, okay?

2027
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,066
Good-bye, Adrianna.

2028
01:31:13,335 --> 01:31:15,368
I don't want you to go, Pop-Pop!

2029
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:16,602
- Really?
- Yeah, really?

2030
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:17,971
Sure. Of course, he gets a hug.

2031
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:21,074
Maybe you can call me and tell
me more Pop-Pop stories.

2032
01:31:21,076 --> 01:31:22,609
I would love to!

2033
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:25,012
Oh. And I also signed you up
for SeniorMatch.com.

2034
01:31:25,014 --> 01:31:27,413
It's a dating website
for old people like you.

2035
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:29,017
Thank you, sweetie.

2036
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:31,619
Honey, it's your mom texting.

2037
01:31:31,621 --> 01:31:33,387
They're just getting
off the plane.

2038
01:31:33,389 --> 01:31:34,820
I'd better go
before they get here.

2039
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,856
I don't want to make anything
awkward.

2040
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:39,193
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, big man.

2041
01:31:39,195 --> 01:31:41,798
- Love you.
- I love you, too, Brad.

2042
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,034
Hey, well, yeah,
you have a good flight.

2043
01:31:58,447 --> 01:32:00,413
Yeah, let's not get that going.

2044
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:01,647
I agree. You've got to start
that younger.

2045
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:02,848
We missed that window.

2046
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,116
I really appreciate the gesture.

2047
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:05,252
You do? Then okay.

2048
01:32:05,254 --> 01:32:07,454
- Hey. I'll see you, kid.
- See you soon, yeah.

2049
01:32:07,456 --> 01:32:08,855
Yeah, bye, kid.

2050
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:11,527
- Are you coming, Pop-Pop?
- Come on, Captain!

2051
01:32:12,059 --> 01:32:13,827
Bye, Dad.

2052
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:15,829
You know, Don,
I've been thinking.

2053
01:32:15,831 --> 01:32:17,431
You don't need a dating app.

2054
01:32:17,433 --> 01:32:19,731
What you need is a wingman.

2055
01:32:19,733 --> 01:32:21,368
I switched our flights to Vegas.

2056
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,470
New Year's at Caesar's,
fix you right up.

2057
01:32:23,472 --> 01:32:25,605
That sounds wonderful!

2058
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:27,607
Where are we connecting through?

2059
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:29,677
Don't start with me, Pop-Pop.

2060
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:31,878
Hey, Braddie.
Don't be nervous now.

2061
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,815
You are the kindest, most gentle
and honest guy I know.

2062
01:32:35,817 --> 01:32:38,485
And whoever your mother
brings down that escalator,

2063
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:40,087
he's gonna love you,
you hear me?

2064
01:32:40,089 --> 01:32:41,224
Grandma!

2065
01:32:45,361 --> 01:32:46,963
Is that Sully?

2066
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,062
Wait, wait, who?

2067
01:32:49,064 --> 01:32:50,296
Sully Sullenberger.

2068
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:53,132
The guy who saved 155 passengers
on the miracle on the Hudson!

2069
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:54,935
Clint Eastwood made
a frickin' movie about it.

2070
01:32:54,937 --> 01:32:56,802
Wait. We watched it at your
house, it was awesome!

2071
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,271
Right. Tom Hanks
and Aaron Eckhart.

2072
01:32:58,273 --> 01:32:59,772
I really enjoyed it.

2073
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,545
That guy is a national hero,
and he's gonna be your stepdad.

2074
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:03,843
Wow. Amazing.

2075
01:33:03,845 --> 01:33:05,846
I bet you he gets free flight
vouchers.

2076
01:33:05,848 --> 01:33:07,847
And maybe get us some vouchers!

2077
01:33:07,849 --> 01:33:08,882
Maybe.

2078
01:33:08,884 --> 01:33:11,551
Well, don't make him wait.
Go say hi. Go! Go!

2079
01:33:11,553 --> 01:33:12,755
Grandma!

2080
01:33:14,223 --> 01:33:16,355
You must be Brad.

2081
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,423
Nope.

2082
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,359
- No, Brad.
- You're not my dad!

2083
01:33:19,361 --> 01:33:20,592
Brad, no, that's a mistake!

2084
01:33:20,594 --> 01:33:22,529
I don't care how
many lives you saved!

2085
01:33:22,531 --> 01:33:25,033
You'll never replace him,
do you hear me?

2086
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:29,136
Brad, he's so nice! Come back!

2087
01:33:29,138 --> 01:33:33,142
You only have one good story,
my father has a million!

You know. Last year, the folks

01:38:55,363 --> 01:38:56,963
They had a... A modern-dress
Nativity.

2143
01:38:56,965 --> 01:39:00,667
Everybody hated it at first, but you
know the folks at St. Benedict's,

01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:02,235
they got back at 'em, all right.

2145

last year.
