1
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,965
<i>Your altitude</i>

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>Is only viewed</i>

3
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,267
<i>As an indication of your attitude</i>

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,561
<i>For you're only as small</i>

5
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,559
<i>As your dreams</i>

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>You may be small not big and tall</i>

7
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,612
<i>But a giant's what you 'twill be called</i>

8
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:11,494
<i>For you're only as small as your dreams</i>

9
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,157
<i>I know that I...</i>

10
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,367
Sorry!

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,827
<i>Yeah, sorry about that.</i>

12
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,829
<i>That's not the story we're telling.</i>

13
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,043
<i>No. We're here for Peter Rabbit.</i>

14
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,344
<i>The hero of our tale.</i>

15
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,557
<i>A young rabbit in a blue coat and no pants.</i>

16
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,181
Hey! Pick on someone your own size.

17
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,265
My pleasure.

18
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,475
I didn't mean me.

19
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,742
Going into his garden again, I see.

20
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,745
There are safer ways to get a meal, you know!

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,077
Yeah, but they're not as fun.

22
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,340
What did I tell you about
sneakin' into McGregor's?

23
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,420
Make sure to get you some cauliflower?

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,093
That's a good boy. Now, off you get.

25
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,757
All right, talk to me, Benjamin.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,841
He's mowed half the lawn,

27
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,597
which maybe gives us just enough time.

28
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,511
Look at him.

29
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,596
Pure evil.

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,598
Even cuts grass angry.

31
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,270
Hey, here's a crazy thought.

32
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,813
What if we don't go in,

33
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,645
because last time, you almost got caught.

34
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,108
You're so adorable.

35
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,276
I could just eat you up.

36
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,609
That's exactly what he wants to do to you.

37
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,031
Higher. Higher.

38
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,826
Why are you always on top?

39
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,119
Because I'm the oldest.

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,787
We're triplets!

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,369
I'm still the oldest.

42
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,792
By 16 seconds.

43
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,879
When's the last time you brushed your tail?

44
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,256
All right, rest time's over. Come on.

45
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,337
- Yeah.
- Race you.

46
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,047
Not if I race you first.

47
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,465
No fair.

48
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,434
Take it all in,

49
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,237
because we're about to take it all in.

50
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,445
Sorry. I don't know why I'm so out of shape.

51
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,617
I only eat salad.

52
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,778
It's the dressing. Get it on the side.

53
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,280
Or just have a drizzle of lemon.

54
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,706
It'll change your life, trust me.

55
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,578
Right. You all know the drill.

56
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,538
I'm not gonna pretend
that what we're about to do

57
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,871
isn't reckless, foolhardy, even dangerous.

58
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,373
But we will succeed,

59
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,674
because each of us plays a vital role

60
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,753
specifically tailored
to our individual talents.

61
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,970
Lookout. Lookout. Lookout. Lookout.

62
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,172
Hero.

63
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,341
Now let's do this.

64
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,760
Right behind ya.

65
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,056
- Not a chance.
- Why?

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,224
Are you afraid I'm gonna get
my foot caught in a trap

67
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,352
and I'll have to gnaw it off,
and then you'll call me "Stumpy"

68
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,854
for the rest of my life,
and I'll have a horrifying scar,

69
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,653
but all the real scars will be on the inside?

70
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,773
Sorry you had to hear that.

71
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,700
It's okay. We're family.
This is a safe space.

72
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,444
All right, bring it in.

73
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,282
- We all ready?
- Yep.

74
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,739
- Absolutely.
- Always.

75
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,369
- I guess.
- Love you guys.

76
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,284
Now, let's do this.

77
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,336
It's gonna be a fun one.

78
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,104
Lettuce, radishes, radicchio.

79
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,272
I'll tell you what's "radicchio."

80
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,771
How easy it is to steal
this man's vegetables.

81
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,112
Because "radicchio" sounds like "ridiculous."

82
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,739
Don't explain the joke.

83
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,947
- Flopsy!
- Yeah!

84
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,449
Mopsy!

85
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,867
Cotton-Tail!

86
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,747
I'm good!

87
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,963
Tomayto, tomahto.

88
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,923
Potayto, potahto.

89
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,554
No one actually says "potahto,"
have you noticed that?

90
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,972
Stop messing around.

91
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,140
I can mess around all I want.

92
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,268
He can't hear us over the lawn...

93
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,974
Mower.

94
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,525
Rabbits.

95
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,457
No, no, stop.

96
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,143
- Leave.
- Scram.

97
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,228
Get out of there.

98
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,410
Peter, no.

99
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,120
- I'm gonna put this in there.
- Don't do that.

100
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,626
- You think this is a bad idea?
- Yes, it's a bad idea.

101
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,544
I'm getting mixed signals. Yes or no?

102
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,751
It's a definite no.

103
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,381
I can't see your mouth through the gate.

104
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,630
No. No. No. No.

105
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,884
- I think you said yes.
- No.

106
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,137
- I'm going with "yes."
- No, no, Peter.

107
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,976
- What?
- Oh, God.

108
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,136
Oh, no.

109
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,679
No.

110
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,978
Peter. No!

111
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,733
Get out of there.

112
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,617
Rabbit, I'm gonna put you in a pie.

113
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,076
Leave the jacket.

114
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,829
Like I did your dad.

115
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,753
Morning, Mr. McGregor.

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,004
Oh, it's you.

117
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,836
Beautiful day, isn't it?

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,007
Give me that rabbit.

119
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,805
You got a little something in your...

120
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,760
You're okay.

121
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
Are you okay?

122
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,812
Did he just wink?

123
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,976
I didn't even know we could do that.

124
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,436
You look very well.

125
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,025
That vein that's usually bulging
out of your head's really calmed down.

126
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,106
Have you been meditating?

127
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,404
This is my garden.

128
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,235
Let me pass that along.

129
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,081
This is his garden.

130
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,783
There we are.

131
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,118
I think we're all on the same page.

132
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,338
So these rabbits will now surrender
their natural instinct to feed themselves.

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,504
Next time will be their last.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,128
I'll be sure to pass that along, too.

135
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,048
Come on, sweeties.

136
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,226
<i>This is Bea.</i>

137
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,847
<i>She's next-door neighbor
to Mr. McGregor and the rabbits.</i>

138
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,476
<i>Guess which one she likes better?</i>

139
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,399
Inside. Come on.
I'll get you something to drink.

140
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,853
You must stop going in there.

141
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,483
You almost got caught this time.

142
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,280
Come here, little one.

143
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,691
Dry you off.

144
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,359
<i>She's an artist.</i>

145
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,241
<i>She moved out to the country
to work on her paintings.</i>

146
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,492
<i>Don't feel bad if you don't
understand them, like them,</i>

147
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,413
<i>even know which way to look at them.</i>

148
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,167
<i>They are terrible and she knows it.</i>

149
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,337
<i>So for fun, she's been painting
portraits of the locals.</i>

150
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,501
<i>Beautiful.</i>

151
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,423
<i>But a constant reminder</i>

152
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,847
<i>of what Peter and his family
had gone through.</i>

153
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,742
I promise I'll always be here for you.

154
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>And she has,</i>

155
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,329
<i>ever since their mother died.</i>

156
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,010
The rain stopped.

157
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,509
Sorry about Dad's jacket.

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,341
I'm sorry you lost Dad's jacket.

159
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,804
I just said that.

160
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,386
Yeah, but coming from the oldest,

161
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,937
it just kind of means more.

162
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,931
Just a jacket.

163
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,691
Dad and Mum are still in here.

164
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,062
And here. And here. And here. And here.

165
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,150
But less so with you,
since you're just a cousin,

166
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,948
you know. You're a nephew, and by marriage.

167
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,525
I'm not taking anything away, I'm just...

168
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,780
You know, I want to be accurate.

169
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,367
Okay, just promise me
you'll stay out of the garden.

170
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,033
Got it back, Dad.

171
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,579
Got you, rabbit.

172
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,411
I knew you'd come.

173
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,875
The lady's not here to protect you now.

174
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,676
I've got a hankering for pie tonight.

175
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,436
Rabbit pie.

176
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,524
What?

177
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,865
What?

178
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,620
Is he...

179
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,089
That's pretty conclusive.

180
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,293
Very conclusive.

181
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,007
That means that... That I...

182
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,713
That I...

183
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,468
That I did it. I did it.

184
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
- What?
- I did it.

185
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,182
Got rid of him. Who's hungry?
Bite into those guys.

186
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,141
You went into his garden?

187
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,098
No. I went into our garden.

188
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,182
Without lookouts?

189
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,312
That's the sort of thing
that will get someone killed.

190
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,860
And it did.

191
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,732
McGregor's gone?

192
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,109
He's in a better place now.

193
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,407
- Really?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,073
That ice cream truck
with the flashing lights.

195
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,572
<i>In actuality, Peter couldn't even claim</i>

196
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,908
<i>that he gave the old man's heart a fright.</i>

197
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,243
<i>Credit for that goes to 78 years</i>

198
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,829
<i>of terrible lifestyle choices.</i>

199
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,297
- Wow.
- No way.

200
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,174
All right, this is our land now,

201
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,884
so let's not go crazy straightaway.

202
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,264
It's our job to nurture it, to sustain it,

203
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,846
prepare for the future.

204
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,603
With privilege, comes responsibility...

205
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,318
I'm sorry. I almost got through
that with a straight face.

206
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,560
Knock yourself out.

207
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,767
Wait for me! I wasn't designed for running!

208
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,653
Sorry about that.

209
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,407
Help yourself to anything. Try the tomatoes.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,412
Look at you, big fella.

211
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,248
Wait, didn't you... Did you try to eat me?

212
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,251
Show me your teeth. Do like a, go like...

213
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,336
It was you! I knew it.

214
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,759
How are you? So good to see you.

215
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,794
Hey, little rabbit.

216
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,546
Got your land back, I see.

217
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,927
All hail the prodigal son.

218
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,510
- It's no big deal.
- No, no, a very big deal.

219
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,515
You vanquished McGregor.

220
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,723
Well, if vanquished means I said to him,

221
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,352
"I've had enough of your tyranny."

222
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,521
And he said, "I will put you in a pie."

223
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,440
And I said, "No, sir.
I will put you in a pie, sir."

224
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,318
It doesn't, but thank you for the party.

225
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,195
Was Pigling eating celery?

226
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,698
It's a shame when you don't know who you are

227
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,405
or where you belong, you know?

228
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,494
Want some?

229
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,333
I'll just take one.

230
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,502
Thanks, Tommy. You're one of the good ones.

231
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,585
Hey! This garden comes with a free house!

232
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,238
Yeah, that's right!

233
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,250
Mr. McGregor will torment us no more!

234
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,453
- No more!
- No more!

235
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,045
<i>Meet Thomas McGregor.</i>

236
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,631
<i>Or, as he is known
in the store where he works,</i>

237
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,504
<i>Mr. McGregor.</i>

238
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,260
<i>You're seeing him at his happiest.</i>

239
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,468
<i>Preparing his troops for battle.</i>

240
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,015
<i>People who say you can't control everything</i>

241
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,142
<i>haven't met this Mr. McGregor.</i>

242
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,101
72.043 degrees.

243
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,610
The angle at which Apollo 13 was launched.

244
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,610
I know, Carlos, you think I'm crazy.

245
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,153
But the little girl
who wants to be an astronaut

246
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,827
is going to know, and you've
just blown up her dreams.

247
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,446
This is a nightmare.

248
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,782
You've got to toss and fluff, toss and fluff.

249
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,162
It's the small things.

250
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,997
You mustn't be afraid
to really get in there, gang.

251
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,580
Our toilets should be clean
as a drinking fountain.

252
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,874
Mr. McGregor.

253
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,959
The general manager has asked to see you.

254
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,258
This is it. My promotion.

255
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,634
They said it could be this week.

256
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,632
How do I look?

257
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,719
Like a man about to drink
toilet water from a straw?

258
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,136
Perfect.

259
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,222
I have some bad news, Thomas.

260
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,019
- No.
- Your great-uncle passed away.

261
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,601
I just received word.

262
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,894
I'm very sorry.

263
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,030
I didn't even know I had a great-uncle.

264
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,569
What about the promotion?

265
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,651
- Excuse me?
- The associate general manager.

266
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,031
The post I've been working
towards for the last 10 years.

267
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,076
You're in shock, I understand.
In times of grief...

268
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,658
No, there's no grief. I just want to know.

269
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,579
Did I get the promotion or not?

270
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,037
- No. It went to Bannerman.
- Bannerman?

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,459
But he is an imbecile.
I mean, he's not even that.

272
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,338
To be rightfully called an imbecile, would
be aspirational for Nigel Bannerman.

273
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,172
But he also happens to be
the managing director's nephew.

274
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,927
So you're promoting a
flagrantly unqualified half-wit

275
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,180
to a position of immense importance
based purely on nepotism.

276
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,769
This is Great Britain.

277
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,347
It's practically written in our charter.

278
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,353
You think I want our best man passed over?

279
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,982
Well, then, don't pass me over.

280
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,653
This is not the time to be
thinking about work, Thomas.

281
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,278
Take some time.

282
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,155
Take as much time as you like.

283
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,238
No, I don't want time! I'm sorry.

284
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,197
I don't want... I'm sorry.

285
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,620
I want the promotion, is the thing,
and I deserve the promotion.

286
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,418
Give me the promotion, June,
I won't tell anyone.

287
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,870
Please.

288
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,207
Give me the promotion.

289
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,086
Sorry.

290
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,757
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's all right.

291
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,055
- Sorry, sir.
- Maybe next time.

292
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,764
What up, McG...

293
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,555
Bannerman.

294
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,181
Congratulations.

295
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,436
I didn't even want it.

296
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,018
I was in Ibiza last night.

297
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,320
Heavy lies the crown, yeah?

298
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,905
I'm taking a break. I'll be in my big office.

299
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
Come here!

300
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,838
I gave my life to you!

301
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,836
I gave you everything!

302
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,554
Why did you treat me...

303
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,812
This might actually be
a blessing in disguise.

305
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,766
Get some perspective. Get a hobby.

306
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,273
Get some dirt underneath your fingernails.

307
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,731
You sound like every employer,
teacher, family member,

308
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,941
friend, and vague acquaintance I've ever had.

309
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,485
I'm going to take your name tag now, Thomas.

310
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:31,569
No, not...

311
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,405
Welcome to Harrods.

312
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,083
I hope you enjoy drinking dirty toilet water.

313
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,377
Might I suggest some time in the country?

314
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,832
It's calming.

315
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,913
Serene!

316
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,374
Yeah!

317
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,462
One hundred and eighty!

318
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,547
Joust! Joust! Joust! Joust!

319
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
Yeah!

320
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,394
Streaker!

321
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,978
Oh, yeah, now it's a party.

322
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,311
- Hors d'oeuvres?
- I'll just take one.

323
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,611
No, it's hitch kick, then boogaloo.

324
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,319
When am I going to get to choreograph?

325
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,870
When you're the oldest.

326
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,614
I can't wait that long.

327
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,415
Hey, let's go get Mum and Dad.

328
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,037
Where do you want it, Peter?

329
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,244
Anywhere's fine.

330
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,497
I mean, maybe a... Maybe a little higher?

331
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,839
A lit... No, too much. A little lower.

332
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,338
To the left. No, to the right.

333
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,928
More. Too far. Lower.

334
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,717
To the right. Up.

335
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,093
Lower. Down.

336
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,265
Right. Right.

337
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,805
Lower. Lower. Lower.

338
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,512
Up. Middle. Left.

339
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,434
Right. Lower. Up.

340
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,266
Your right. My left.

341
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,976
Your down. My up.

342
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,151
Left. Right.

343
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,436
Perfect.

344
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,023
He's gone now, guys.

345
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,238
I just wish you were here to enjoy it.

346
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,580
I'm never letting anyone
take it from us again.

347
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,672
Thomas McGregor?

348
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,881
Sign here, please.

349
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,843
From Windermere? Fancy place, that.

350
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,514
I don't know anyone from Windermere.

351
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,937
Well, it's from Unclaimed Property.

352
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,727
Usually means you've inherited something.

353
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,229
<i>Inherited something, he did.</i>

354
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,687
<i>From that great-uncle
he knew nothing about.</i>

355
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,192
<i>Turns out, intimacy issues run in the family.</i>

356
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,616
Windermere? That's in the country.

357
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,734
Well, fancy country.

358
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,615
The houses there go for a king's ransom.

359
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,909
Ransom enough to buy my own toy shop?

360
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:40,990
I'd imagine so.

361
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,074
And fill it with the finest merchandise?

362
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,159
Should do, yeah.

363
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,619
Ransom enough to have tempered glass
shelving and seasonal window decorations?

364
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,956
That I might have to do
some research on, sir.

365
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,045
Can I get back to you mail-time tomorrow?

366
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,178
Round trip to Windermere, please.

367
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,350
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

368
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,276
Good evening. Are you aware of this location?

369
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,483
- The McGregor manor?
- Yes.

370
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,279
- Is that where you're staying?
- It's just temporary.

371
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,698
I am merely appraising the manor's condition

372
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,491
before putting it on the market to sell.

373
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,539
But you do want me to take you there?

374
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:23,911
Yes.

375
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,992
- Well, hop in.
- Thank you.

376
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,702
I think you're really going
to love living there.

377
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,204
Please don't talk to me on the drive.

378
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,589
- Give it to me.
- Here.

379
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,551
I can fly!

380
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,599
I think I cracked a rib.

381
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,934
How many ribs do we have?

382
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,764
- Thirteen.
- No way.

383
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,971
Sweet.

384
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,517
Oh, no, but don't...

385
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,815
I can fly...

386
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,898
It's nothing against the country.
I just find it disgusting.

387
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,322
Yes, you've made that quite clear
on the journey, sir.

388
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,861
I would just like the record to reflect that.

389
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,865
Well, I shall create a record
and make sure that it reflects it.

390
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,071
A human.

391
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,161
Oh, dear. Everybody out! Out!

392
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,620
Get out! Humans are coming! Human! Human!

393
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,000
You know, it's like, who am I?

394
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,291
Who are you? Yeah?

395
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,843
You know, like, we're all connected,

396
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,678
but with what rope?

397
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,095
A human! Humans are coming!

398
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,638
- What should we do?
- What?

399
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,099
Everybody hide!

400
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,856
Your quills are stabbing me.

401
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,154
I wasn't designed for hiding.

402
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,245
Who lives like this?

403
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,373
Hit the lights!

404
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,417
Oh, no. Tommy!

405
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,673
Tommy, hide!

406
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,091
No, just because you can't see him,

407
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,424
doesn't mean he can't see you. Understand?

408
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,426
Now hide!

409
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,303
What? No, Tommy.

410
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,730
Now you're just posing as a candelabra.

411
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,773
Now you're just a tablecloth.

412
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,100
Now you're just a...

413
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,518
What are you?

414
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:16,854
I'm a lazy Susan.

415
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,938
What?

416
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,360
Tommy! Tommy!

417
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,116
Get... Get out!

418
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,533
Get...

419
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,365
Get out!

420
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,961
Every single one of you! Out, you vermin!

421
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,464
Stay out of my house!

422
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,131
He had the key.

423
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,884
He must be a McGregor.

424
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,013
Headlights.

425
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,308
Felix, blink. Blink, blink, blink, blink.

426
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,723
Come on, big guy. Blink, blink, blink.

427
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,353
Headlights.

428
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,060
Come on, deer.

429
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,947
The sun came up again?

430
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,324
I can't believe it!

431
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,784
I thought when I closed my eyes last night,

432
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,036
that that was it!

433
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,748
But we have another day of this!

434
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,348
It wasn't a nightmare.

435
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,515
It's a nightmare.

436
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,291
What is that music?

437
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,668
I don't know.

438
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,502
But it sounds very dramatic
and life-changing.

439
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,685
Hello, sweeties.

440
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,275
You checking on the new neighbor?

441
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,402
Don't worry. He can't be any worse

442
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,567
than the old crab bucket, rest his soul.

443
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,033
Never know, maybe he'll be
a nice, normal man.

444
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,447
He looks nice.

445
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,070
Looks very normal.

446
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,536
That's not very normal, is it?

447
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,617
That's normal.

448
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,289
Anyway, it's gonna be exciting.

449
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,791
We'll have somebody new around here.

450
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,419
They're not all bad, I promise.

451
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,754
I'll explain it to him.

452
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,839
We all share our land around here.

453
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,844
I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt.

454
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,640
Oh, no.

455
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,151
It's not over.
We can always go in the back...

456
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,311
Or through the...

457
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,395
Or use the...

458
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:46,939
Or behind the...

459
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,774
I didn't even know that was a way in.

460
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,617
I see the gates are back up.

461
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,946
I guess you weren't
the prodigal son after all.

462
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,532
That'll do, pig. That'll do.

463
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,037
It was a fun night, though.

464
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,539
I haven't eaten that much in a long time.

465
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,496
The diet starts now.

466
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,082
Now.

467
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,630
- Now.
- Hey, look.

468
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,715
Hello. Sorry.

469
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,344
I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Bea.

470
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,676
I just live over here.

471
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,931
Hello. I'm Thomas.

472
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,060
I live way over there in London.

473
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,100
That way.

474
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,440
Yes. I'm just here temporarily.

475
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,192
I'm fixing up this place to sell,

476
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:29,945
using the proceeds to open my own toy store,

477
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,572
preferably near Harrods so they
can witness their own downfall.

478
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,076
Oh, my. That's a lot
of information right there.

479
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,197
- Sorry.
- Good for you

480
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,282
for not being afraid to open up.

481
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,413
- What are they saying?
- I can read lips.

482
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,164
I'm just a little out of my element.

483
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,750
I think you'll find the elements
here are pretty fabulous.

484
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,424
"I think you'll find
the elephants around here

485
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,418
"are really flatulent."

486
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:50,878
What?

487
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,259
In my opinion, it's just the
most beautiful place on Earth.

488
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,683
Well, it just got a lot more beautiful.

489
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,226
You didn't just say that.

490
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,732
And clean, sturdy, functional.

491
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,984
Oh, the gate.

492
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,816
- Yes.
- I thought you were saying

493
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,359
- I was beautiful.
- Did you...

494
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,567
No, no, no. No, I wouldn't say that.

495
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,650
I wouldn't say that.

496
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,240
- I would say that. I'm not...
- No, hey, I'm not fishing.

497
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,447
- It's fine.
- You are beautiful.

498
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,164
And you're different to the gate.

499
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,539
I can't read lips, but I know her,

500
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,541
and she's telling him
to take down those gates,

501
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,873
and let us into the garden.

502
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,878
Well, enjoy your brief stay.

503
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,922
Just, please, don't be like the nasty old man

504
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,799
who used to live here. He was a real twit.

505
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,592
- He was my uncle.
- You didn't let me finish.

506
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,015
He was a real...

507
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,636
Sorry, I can't...

508
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,641
No. There's no saving that one.
He was a real twit.

509
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,936
- No offense.
- None taken.

510
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,440
- I never knew him.
- You seem much more reasonable.

511
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,728
Do I?

512
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,860
Although, I must say, these
gates are incredibly sturdy.

513
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,987
Are you expecting an alien invasion?

514
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,741
I just need to keep the wildlife
out where they belong.

515
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,247
Well, they actually belong everywhere.

516
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,449
It was kind of their place first.
We're the latecomers.

517
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,912
How long does it take to say, "Leave
the gate open, and let in the rabbits"?

518
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,539
Leave the gate open, and let in the rabbits.

519
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,460
I certainly will, madam.

520
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,793
And might I say, those rabbits
are incredibly cute.

521
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,463
Especially the one
with the blue coat. He's my favorite.

522
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,925
And oh, here's a present.

523
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,349
Wait. Why is she bringing him a present?

524
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,428
How nice of you.

525
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,808
It's for bird-watching.

526
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,139
Thank you.

527
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,480
There's one. It has wings.

528
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,482
Yes, that's a pretty defining feature

529
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,109
of the bird, I think you'll find.

530
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,825
You spotted your first bird.
Make sure to mark it down later.

531
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,235
Mark it down?

532
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,952
So there's a way of organizing
and documenting the chaos of the sky?

533
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,240
Yes.

534
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,451
Well, it was nice to meet you, Thomas.

535
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,415
Yes, you, too.

536
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,248
And let's keep this gate open, shall we,

537
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,334
so the wildlife can run free?

538
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,130
- Absolutely.
- She did it.

539
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,803
We're in. Come on.

540
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,302
Maybe it's not so bad here, after all.

541
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,232
- No.
- I don't care.

542
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,150
- I'm going in.
- Right behind you.

543
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,482
No. Not a chance.

544
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,358
You remember what happened to Dad, right?

545
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,655
But you go in all the time.

546
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,073
That's my character flaw.

547
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,699
You get your own character flaw.

548
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,868
- Come on, Benjamin.
- Why does he get to go?

549
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,700
Yeah, why do I have to go in?

550
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,413
Because that's his character flaw.

551
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,917
He goes along with everything I say,
no matter how stupid and reckless it is.

552
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,294
No, I don't! You're not the boss of me!

553
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,963
- Benjamin.
- Coming!

554
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,637
I can't let him go in by himself.
He's being stupid and reckless.

555
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,135
I hope they're going to be okay.

556
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,888
They'll be fine, and if not,

557
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,225
I guess I'll just be
the new head of the family.

558
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,186
Peter, please be okay!

559
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,650
I'm still so out of shape.

560
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,944
How's it working with the putting
the dressing on the side?

561
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,369
Good. But I don't understand why
it's healthier to drink it all at once.

562
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,863
Disgusting.

563
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,448
Come on.

564
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,818
What'd I tell ya? Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

565
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,983
- Rats.
- Run!

566
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,416
Hello.

567
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,803
This guy is so much faster than the old one.

568
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,142
I think we have a problem.

569
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,273
- What is it?
- Everything's upside down.

570
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,566
Where are you?

571
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,857
We never should have come in the garden.

572
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,362
No guts, no glory.

573
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,364
Are you ever scared of anything?

574
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,866
Yeah. Dying alone.

575
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:28,622
That's why I brought you here.

576
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,205
Do you know what we do with rats in the city?

577
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:37,381
We find them, and we exterminate them.

578
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,419
Benjamin.

579
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,489
- Follow me.
- I can't see anything.

580
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,072
- Follow my voice.
- I can't hear anything!

581
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,156
Follow your heart?

582
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,240
What?

583
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,534
That way, that way, that way.

584
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,542
Play dead.

585
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,057
This is what happens

586
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,517
when you make a McGregor look foolish

587
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,690
playing carnival games in the shed.

588
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,026
You see this, everyone?

589
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,825
This is what happens!

590
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,781
Why am I talking to wildlife?

591
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,784
I am losing my mind.

592
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,999
I do... They're not going to respond.

593
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,873
Come on, come on!

594
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,838
Jump!

595
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,246
Okay, okay. Flopsy, take the bag,

596
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,293
go to the window
and you put it over his head.

597
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,374
Okay.

598
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,754
Mopsy, you take the bag,

599
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,759
go over to the window, put it over his head.

600
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:51,840
Got it.

601
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,472
Cotton-Tail, take the bag...

602
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,227
- Just give him a wet willy.
- Got it.

603
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,839
No!

604
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,303
You okay, big guy?

605
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,730
Close one, huh?

606
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,938
I could've been killed.

607
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,358
And not just me. What if he got the girls?

608
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,736
This isn't a joke, Peter.

609
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,270
I know.

610
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,064
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,242
You're all right though, right?

612
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,903
I got your jacket back.

613
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,699
It's not as symbolic as mine.

614
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,409
You know, not being your dad's and all.

615
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,037
And it's brown, too, which is
a mistake because you're brown.

616
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,580
I mean, brown on brown, who wears that?

617
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,248
It's a bit matchy-matchy.

618
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,168
Yeah, it's actually a bit confusing.

619
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,091
Half the time we think you're naked.

620
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,755
I just look for the buttons.

621
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,088
But then one time, it was your nipples.

622
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,138
Anyway, you got it back, and you're okay.

623
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,391
No thanks to him. Look at him.

624
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,309
Skinny bag of wet.

625
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,601
Now, turn around and drive us home, Eugene.

626
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,231
Here's good.

627
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,106
New to the area.
Probably taking the next turn.

628
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,152
Just using more fuel. Not a surprise

629
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,071
that he's not environmentally friendly.

630
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,822
Hey, we don't inherit the Earth,

631
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,246
we borrow it from our children.

632
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,037
I read that on a plastic cup.

633
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,325
If you do a U-turn...

634
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,787
It's actually a safe place for a U-turn here.

635
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,871
I think that's the...

636
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,002
- Where...
- Where is he taking us?

637
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,550
He's taking us into town.

638
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,630
- So this is London.
- Wow.

639
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,551
Big Ben! Wow!

640
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,883
It's gigantic.

641
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,764
I hope you appreciate this, Flopsy.

642
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,016
I never got to travel when I was your age.

643
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,316
What? You were my age,
like, three streets ago.

644
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,276
It goes so fast.

645
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,613
This must be Harrods.

646
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,070
Wow. Classy.

647
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,489
What can I do for you?

648
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,949
I have a vermin problem.

649
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,074
Rabbits, I'm guessing.

650
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,372
- How do you know that?
- You're the new McGregor.

651
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,204
- Bea's neighbor.
- How do you know that?

652
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,039
- She mentioned you.
- She did?

653
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,582
What did she say?

654
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,338
That you want to sell your house in a hurry

655
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,712
and use the profits
to open your own toy store,

656
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,427
preferably near Harrods, so they
can witness their own downfall.

657
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,352
That's incredibly specifically accurate,
and a little disappointing.

658
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,098
Who do you think these guys are?

659
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,558
They're wearing aprons,

660
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,476
so that could mean only one thing.

661
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,774
- They're hedgehogs.
- They're hedgehogs.

662
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,189
Just make sure she doesn't find out
you're launching them rabbits.

663
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,862
She loves 'em. Like family.

664
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,777
Read their lips, Mopsy.

665
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,111
If I was a learned fellow,

666
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,319
I'd say she anthropomorphizes 'em

667
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,696
in lieu of any genuine human interaction.

668
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,159
But he's not a learned fellow.

669
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,287
Which is why I think she's just got
a thing for those rabbits.

670
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,419
"Which is why I think she's just got
a thing for most man butts."

671
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,579
What would you suggest?

672
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,415
An electric fence will keep 'em out.

673
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,041
To launch 'em,

674
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,252
you'll need some firepower.

675
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,171
Firepower seems like... I don't want to...

676
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,297
Get down.

677
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,391
That's them! I knew it.

678
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,765
Where are you? I know you're in there.

679
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,229
Come out! I saw you!

680
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,813
Launch them. I want to launch them.

681
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,440
Right. Follow me.

682
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,244
It's okay. I've got 11 more ribs.

683
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,113
You actually have 13 on each side.

684
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,197
What?

685
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,783
Which is technically 26 because they go...

686
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,454
Now you're down to 19.

687
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,206
Again, you push this button.

688
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,539
The signal will travel
through the air to this.

689
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,249
This'll start the spark,

690
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,208
and anything near it will explode.

691
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,052
I do understand the fundamental
concepts of basic things.

692
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,267
It's tricky. A little bit.

693
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,599
Thank you.

694
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,936
Thank you!

695
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,062
Drive safe!

696
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,860
Just match its speed.

697
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,568
Our natural rabbits' pace
should be able to keep up.

698
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,790
Do you know what?
That would never have worked.

699
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,298
Watch it, boxhead!

700
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,839
Leave him alone, babe.
He's just a country bumpkin.

701
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:24,923
Morons.

702
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,428
"Country bumpkin"? I'm not a country bumpkin.

703
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,848
I'm from London,
which is where I'd like to...

704
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,350
- Thomas?
- Bea.

705
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,565
- Hello.
- Hello.

706
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,188
- How are you?
- I'm very well. You...

707
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,269
What are you doing here?

708
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,152
Just... Just picking up some,

709
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,191
hardware.

710
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,487
- It's lovely to see you.
- What?

711
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,444
- Can I offer you a lift?
- Why is she here?

712
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,700
Oh, no. He's stealing her bike.

713
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,158
That's all right. It's more difficult
than I thought it was.

714
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,538
Oh, no. He's stealing her.

715
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,911
Oh, no.

716
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,998
She's going willingly and seems
to be enjoying his company.

717
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,082
Come on, come on.

718
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,630
Come on.

719
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,264
That's a lot of smiling.

720
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,269
More than before, even.

721
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,851
She is showing more teeth.

722
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,231
Must mean she likes him.

723
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,855
Not "aw."

724
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,532
She doesn't like him. She's just really nice.

725
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,617
She smiles at us all the time.

726
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,277
Not like that.

727
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,496
Come in.

728
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,543
Would you like something to drink?

729
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,168
Yes, please.

730
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,427
Are these your paintings?

731
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,051
That's just a work in progress.

732
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:53,228
No, no, this is, this is beautiful.

733
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,887
Thank you.

734
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,106
What a majestic mountain range.

735
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,978
It's an old woman in a hat.

736
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,980
Right. Yeah. There's... There's the hat.

737
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,649
- That's her eyes.
- Yes.

738
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,150
- And that's her chin.
- It's her foot.

739
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,231
That's her foot.

740
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,527
I'm allergic to blackberries.

741
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,783
I'm sorry. My throat closes up.

742
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,082
Allergic to blackberries?

743
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,242
Is that even a thing?
Is that where we've got to?

744
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,917
I mean, everyone's suddenly
allergic to everything.

745
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,631
Stop using it as a crutch!

746
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,462
You know, some people do have
legitimate medical conditions.

747
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,794
Of course, of course. It's a real
struggle and my heart goes out to them.

748
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,881
It's very tough, very sad.
I don't want to get any letters.

749
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,557
But this guy, come on!

750
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,800
What about these?

751
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,181
That's just something I do for fun,

752
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,559
when I'm not focusing on my real work.

753
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:38,806
These are beautiful.

754
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,517
You don't have to say that.

755
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,438
I mean, they must be good if I like them,

756
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,895
given how much I hate rabbits.

757
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,615
I mean, somehow, you managed to make
them look not like the vermin they are.

758
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,109
Vermin? Vermin?

759
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,320
- What does "vermin" mean?
- Like a rodent.

760
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,331
Rodent? Rodent?

761
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,783
What does "rodent" mean?

762
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,243
Like a rat or a mouse.

763
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,455
You think rabbits are vermin?
You're joking, right?

764
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,757
Yes. I'm joking.

765
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,673
'Cause I'm hilarious and whimsical.

766
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,173
Rabbits are actually perfect creatures.

767
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,552
They're generous,

768
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,592
honest, pure.

769
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,556
You should see the way
they talk to each other.

770
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,891
They do this incredible thing
when they're apologizing.

771
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,189
Rabbits apologize?

772
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,851
They put their heads together, like this.

773
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,857
No. No, no, no, don't apologize to him.

774
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,817
Why is she apologizing to him?

775
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:34,571
Wow, that's taking a long time.

776
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,490
She's apologizing the heck out of that guy.

777
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,206
<i>And this was only the beginning.</i>

778
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,420
<i>It didn't get any easier for Peter
and the others to stomach.</i>

779
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,467
<i>Or understand.</i>

780
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,709
Anyway.

781
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,711
You'll see.

782
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,383
You'll grow to love them.

783
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,342
<i>But romance is a powerful thing.</i>

784
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,469
<i>It can sneak up on any two people.</i>

785
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,099
<i>Even if one is amazing,</i>

786
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,352
<i>and the other is a McGregor.</i>

787
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,307
And after my parents died,
I was put in a group home.

788
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,388
Peel.

789
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,519
That must have been awfully
traumatic for you.

790
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,017
Did you deal with it okay? Peel.

791
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,143
Didn't affect me in the slightest. Peel.

792
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,196
Yes, I can see that.

793
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,774
Maybe I have some tendencies.

794
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,527
Yeah, to commit rabbit-cide.

795
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,028
- Is that a word?
- No.

796
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,331
Well, I think we all have our tendencies.

797
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,449
Peel.

798
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,533
What are yours?

799
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,369
I guess I don't like people

800
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,250
who aren't who they say they are.

801
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,496
It's more about me.

802
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,501
I keep saying I'm a real painter,
yet I can't seem to finish anything real.

803
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,295
But she paints us.

804
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,670
We're real.

805
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:15,801
Aren't we real?

806
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,140
Yep, definitely real.

807
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,510
What do you miss most about the store?

808
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,187
And don't say,
"Having everything in its proper place."

809
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,305
I get it.

810
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,015
You have control issues.

811
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,146
I miss being helpful.

812
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,357
A parent or grandparent comes into the shop

813
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,485
looking for a gift for the child they love.

814
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,987
I ask a few simple questions,
and know exactly what they need.

815
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,287
I love helping people get what they want.

816
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:44,871
You know?

817
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,170
Especially when they don't
even know that they want it.

818
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,205
Those are the best.

819
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,461
Also, neatly arranged displays.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

820
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,552
Yes! Bananas! I win!

821
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,679
Wait, "taradiddle" isn't a word.

822
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,183
Yes, it is. It means "fib,"
"pretentious nonsense."

823
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,308
That is exactly the sort of definition
you'd make up for a made-up word.

824
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:12,403
Mr. McGregor, are you accusing
me of taradiddling?

825
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,036
Oh, no. Damn it.

826
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,663
Come here, come here.

827
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,456
I'll protect you.

828
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,802
Come in. Come in, quick.

829
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,193
- Closed.
- Pull up a chair.

830
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,525
We're wearing fur.

831
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,525
- Thank you.
- You're drenched. Sit down.

832
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,982
Let me help you dry off.

833
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,275
Thank you very much.

834
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,964
I could stay here forever.

835
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,007
Hello.

836
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,597
Haven't seen you in the longest time.

837
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,641
Meet my new friend, Thomas.

838
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,603
- Would you like to have a hold?
- Among other things.

839
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,485
Oh, look.

840
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,148
My two boys getting along perfectly.

841
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,319
Nothing could make me happier.

842
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,151
Do you mind if I paint this?

843
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,070
Nothing would make me happier.

844
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,413
You're mine now, rabbit.

845
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,515
Thomas, are your eyes emerald
or sea-foam green?

846
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,060
Sea-foam green with a hint
of battleship gray.

847
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,310
I thought so.

848
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:24,819
Thomas?

849
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,535
And that's what separates us from the French.

850
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,575
Yup. Kiwi green.

851
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,993
You're the professional.

852
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,225
No, no, no, it's an old woman
in a hat, you see?

853
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,567
I just assumed she would've
reentered at that exact moment.

854
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,991
You need to stop.

855
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,417
It's not going to end well.

856
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,412
I think I found it.

857
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,038
The perfect ma...

858
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,257
My painting!

859
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,425
It's ruined.

860
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,136
You know how uncontrollable
wildlife can be. I just...

861
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,096
- Bad rabbit. Bad rabbit!
- Yes, bad rabbit.

862
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,351
- Naughty.
- Bad rabbit!

863
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,683
- Out, get out.
- Out.

864
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:38,894
I said, shoo. Shoo!

865
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,060
Get out of here!

866
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,489
I'm so sorry. He just went mad.

867
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:44,899
Are you all right?

868
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,826
He's gotta go.

869
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,949
No way!

870
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,126
The sun came up again!

871
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,288
If I knew this was gonna keep happening,

872
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,668
certainly wouldn't have
fertilized all those eggs!

873
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,376
Now I have to stick around till they hatch!

874
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,388
And be present and involved!

875
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,634
<i>And so,</i>

876
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:15,017
<i>Peter prepared his troops
for full-on battle.</i>

877
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,397
Why you kids walking so slow?

878
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,191
And that is how you sneak up on someone.

879
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,400
<i>Come on, they're ten percent pluck
twenty percent blur</i>

880
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,949
<i>Fifteen percent concentrated power of fur</i>

881
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,198
<i>Five percent muscle fifty percent brains</i>

882
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,749
<i>A hundred percent reason
To remember the names</i>

883
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,539
<i>No, they don't need their name known forever</i>

884
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,333
<i>They just want to be rid
of young Mr. McGregor</i>

885
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,460
<i>They're feelin' the pressure</i>

886
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,587
<i>Tired of runnin' around feelin' frightened</i>

887
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,260
<i>Despite the fact that Bea somehow thinks</i>

888
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,674
<i>That she likes him but they know the code</i>

889
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,050
<i>It's not about the salary</i>

890
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,803
<i>It's all about the celery
and maybe some radishes</i>

891
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,222
<i>Maybe some cabbages,
gotta let the animals know</i>

892
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,556
<i>That means when they get ready,
gotta go, go, go</i>

893
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,519
You can do this, Flops.

894
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,563
Take a deep breath, pull it back,

895
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,818
and picture the one face
you'd most like to see get hit.

896
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,232
Got someone.

897
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,777
Sorry!

898
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,199
Stop it.

899
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:08,676
He's got to go.

900
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,298
He's got to go.

901
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,263
His face was so classic. He was like...

902
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,345
All of the rakes. I mean,

903
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,138
I didn't even think it would work that well.

904
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,683
It was right on the edge of believability.

905
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:21,764
You guys.

906
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,271
How did you even get that
wheelbarrow up there?

907
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,274
It was a perfectly crafted sequence.

908
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,355
Now listen.

909
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,156
We've got him just where we want him.

910
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,071
It's on to the next phase.

911
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,202
That might not be possible.

912
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,165
That's a serious electric fence.

913
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,584
Why is he feeding it peanut butter?

914
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,669
Yummy.

915
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,629
He's trying to bait us into touching it.

916
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,723
What happens if we touch it?

917
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,634
We're about to find out.

918
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,055
No, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle! Stop! No.

919
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,727
I'm four and a half years old.

920
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,317
I need some excitement before I check out.

921
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,523
- Don't do it!
- No, Tiggy-Winkle, stop!

922
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,276
Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, it's not worth it!

923
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,075
Look away.

924
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,961
Guys, I have an idea.

925
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,000
You remember what Dad used to say to us?

926
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,129
"Never go into McGregor's garden."

927
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,840
Yeah, but what else did he say to us?

928
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,634
Don't electrify a lady hedgehog.

929
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,968
Maybe we should rethink
some of the other stuff Dad said to us.

930
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:43,767
Yeah, like, "You can't
put lipstick on a pig."

931
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,060
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is lip balm.

932
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,021
It's cherry flavor, so it
might appear to be lipstick,

933
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,694
but this is lip balm.

934
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,650
Yes, yes, yes. Okay, he also used to say,

935
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,576
"You can't out-clever a fox,

936
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,787
"so use his cleverness against him."

937
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,490
Come on, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle! That's enough!

938
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,508
Two-winged

939
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,843
flying

940
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,424
bird.

941
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,519
And here we go.

942
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,316
And zap.

943
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:34,605
And zap.

944
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,118
And zap?

945
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,326
And zap.

946
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:48,745
Zap. Zap.

947
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,666
Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap!

948
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,018
What is happening?

949
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,913
Wow, another McGregor down.

950
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,906
Looks like you did it again, Peter.

951
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,165
Let me just check.

952
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,870
Yeah, I felt brain.

953
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,331
Now, if history is any indication,

954
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,004
that ice cream truck with
the lights'll take him away.

955
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,501
Sorry.

956
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,377
Explosives. Explosives.

957
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,623
Hide. Quick.

958
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,374
Follow me.

959
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,799
You push this, signal goes
through the air, towards this,

960
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,428
and everything in there goes...

961
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,721
Good-bye, rabbits.

962
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,223
Rabbits?

963
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,771
Hello? Rabbits?

964
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,270
- Rabbits?
- Thomas?

965
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:20,903
Yeah?

966
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,982
What are you doing out in the garden so late?

967
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,528
I'm picking wildflowers.

968
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,865
It's for you.

969
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,993
He's come back to life.

970
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,460
With a light on his head.

971
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,829
He's evolving.

972
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,131
What were you doing out in the garden?

973
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,000
Doing?

974
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,217
Yeah. By the tree.

975
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,174
"Doing" can mean so many things, can't it?

976
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,177
- I mean, I was, I was...
- Would you mind?

977
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,263
- It's just awfully bright.
- I was do... ls it?

978
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,929
Is it distracting you from what
you were asking me just then?

979
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,012
Is it better down?

980
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,973
Up. Up. It's quite bright.

981
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,897
And so we advance to endgame.

982
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,770
You sure you know what you're doing?

983
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,272
What? We're tryin' to get our garden back.

984
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,899
Is that really what this is all about?

985
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,153
Of course, that's what it's about.

986
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:08,611
You think I've got some kind
of ulterior motive,

987
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,239
that I'm harboring some kind
of emotional connection to her,

988
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,244
because of losing my own mother and father

989
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,201
and I think if she goes, what have I got?

990
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,497
It's only about the garden,

991
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,545
and I don't know what's
happened to my voice. It...

992
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,165
It shouldn't be this high.

993
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,002
It should be lower.

994
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,753
I love her like a mother.

995
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,133
Yes, that was very convincing.

996
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,885
It's only about the garden.

997
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:30,966
Yes, it is.

998
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,387
I'm stuck. My voice is stuck.

999
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,468
- Cotton-Tail, can you just...
- Yeah.

1000
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,021
Thank you. Let's do this.

1001
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,231
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

1002
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,479
I'm not sure I want to be
part of this anymore.

1003
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,110
Of course, you do.

1004
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,153
Just do what I say. It will all work out.

1005
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,485
"Like always, huh?"

1006
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,075
Said the rabbit who almost
got thrown into a river.

1007
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,321
Trust me.

1008
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,117
I got this.

1009
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,272
Cotton-Tail, go.

1010
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,315
Hello?

1011
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,695
Ready. Aim. Hold it.

1012
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:34,155
Hold it.

1013
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,914
- Thomas.
- Fire!

1014
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,293
- Morning.
- You fancy a spot of lunch later?

1015
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,914
Yes. That... Lunch would be lovely.

1016
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,249
I was thinking of making a salad.

1017
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,833
Yeah.

1018
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,464
Or maybe a soup. What would you prefer?

1019
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,009
Let me think. Soup. Soup.

1020
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,467
Would you like water,
or sparkling water, or...

1021
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,768
Would you just pick one, please?

1022
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,440
Look at you, you're doing
your relaxation pose.

1023
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,608
- Arms up.
- Yeah. What?

1024
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,902
- Arms up.
- Really? Up?

1025
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,316
- Yep, up they go.
- You know where to aim.

1026
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,397
All right.

1027
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,492
- You look really relaxed.
- So relaxed.

1028
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,910
Just going to do some painting.

1029
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,203
Blackberries. Blackberries!

1030
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,410
No, but he's allergic to...

1031
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,537
Clever.

1032
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:24,913
Shoot for the mouth.

1033
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,626
I might put some music on.
I hope it's not too loud.

1034
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,172
Get in there and create!

1035
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:31,253
I'm out.

1036
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,505
- Flopsy.
- Visualize the face.

1037
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,636
Look at my face. Turn his face into my face.

1038
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,634
Now stop looking at my face
and look at his face,

1039
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,310
but see my face, and fire!

1040
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,222
- Yes!
- Flopsy!

1041
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,186
Blackberries.

1042
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,200
That should do it.

1043
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:04,828
What?

1044
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,584
This guy's like some kind of sorcerer.

1045
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:07,706
That's it.

1046
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:26,061
This is starting to get out of control.

1047
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,359
No, no, this is perfect.

1048
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,647
Remember your training.

1049
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,229
Wait, did we train for this?

1050
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,329
How is this perfect?

1051
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,036
She should've heard us by now.

1052
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,341
I'm hit.

1053
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,176
- I'm hit.
- Mopsy!

1054
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,302
No!

1055
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,105
Flopsy, I need you to know something.

1056
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,353
I'm not the oldest.

1057
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:13,650
- What?
- You were always so cute and lovable.

1058
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,448
And Cotton-Tail, well, she's...

1059
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,321
Cotton-Tail,

1060
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,327
so Mum and Dad told us I was the oldest,

1061
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,875
so I had something.

1062
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,037
But, really, you're the oldest,

1063
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,963
and I'm nothing.

1064
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,541
No! Mopsy, don't go.

1065
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,125
Mopsy?

1066
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,847
It was just a tomato. I'm fine.

1067
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,595
Guys, I'm fine!

1068
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,726
It's just a tomato!

1069
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,145
Hey, you never heard
any of that stuff, got me?

1070
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,644
Dink.

1071
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,959
Gotcha! You listen to me.

1072
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,007
I am not a bad guy.

1073
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,339
You turned me into this.

1074
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,049
I am a nice person.

1075
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,308
I've chilled out, man.

1076
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:25,803
I'm cool now.

1077
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:29,314
I've evolved, but you, you're still the same.

1078
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:30,933
Still full of mischief.

1079
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,312
And that's why things are not
going to end well for you.

1080
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:39,361
Because you poked at me and you poked at me,

1081
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:42,570
until all that's left
for me to do is wring your...

1082
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,653
What's going on here?

1083
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,909
You've got to chew your food!

1084
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:46,990
I saved him.

1085
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,951
What happened? ls he okay?

1086
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,035
Yeah, I... He...

1087
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:52,582
The poor little guy,
he was choking on some radish.

1088
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,665
So I just... I've checked his pulse,

1089
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,125
and everything's gonna be okay.

1090
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,251
You're going to be okay!

1091
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,714
So off you go. Off you go. There we are.

1092
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:04,883
It's a miracle.

1093
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,384
Yeah.

1094
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,516
I thought I heard some loud noises.

1095
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:09,808
It was a bit of a ruckus.

1096
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:12,060
I was painting, so I can't
be sure, but did you...

1097
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,143
No, I don't think so... I was weeding.

1098
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,982
I do make grunting noises
when I weed sometimes.

1099
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:20,777
It's just people have used explosives
before to keep the rabbits out.

1100
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,858
Explosives?

1101
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:22,942
But you wouldn't do that.

1102
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,027
I wouldn't do something like that.

1103
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,362
- No, of course not.
- They're angels.

1104
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:26,572
This is their place as much as ours.

1105
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,247
- Yeah, exactly.
- Learned that from you.

1106
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,618
I just thought I heard something.

1107
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,331
Is that a two-winged flying bird up there?

1108
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,624
- I must mark it down.
- Where?

1109
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,251
- Up there.
- She believes him.

1110
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,833
We'll never get rid of him now.

1111
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,587
I don't think so.

1112
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,512
Up there. Just in that...
In the faraway tree.

1113
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,177
You are using explosives.

1114
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,392
You lied to me.

1115
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,856
Well, yes, but...

1116
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,170
My house.

1117
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,005
My paintings.

1118
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:29,676
Their burrow.

1119
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,188
This is going to be difficult
for you to hear,

1120
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:36,558
but he did it.

1121
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,317
He detonated it.

1122
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:40,937
He's a rabbit.

1123
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,522
I know.

1124
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,107
But somehow,

1125
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,860
he found the detonator,
and he took his paw...

1126
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,201
And he did all that to come between us.

1127
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,998
He's a rabbit!

1128
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,742
All right. Okay. Let's be reasonable.

1129
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,623
For a start, you know
they rob from the garden.

1130
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,334
Did you know they set traps in my bed?

1131
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,166
So when I woke up, I hurt my little fingers!

1132
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,088
And then they used electricity against me,

1133
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,464
which we invented,

1134
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:07,172
but they modified for
their own nefarious purposes!

1135
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,885
And they saw the Bananagrams,

1136
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,468
they saw the bicycle ride,
they saw the walk in the park.

1137
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,723
And where did they get
the jackets? We don't know!

1138
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,350
But they've been there all along.

1139
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,644
You're a crazy person.

1140
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,688
I can't believe I thought I liked you.

1141
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:21,686
You do like me.

1142
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,611
And I like you. That's...

1143
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,402
Are you okay, sweeties?

1144
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,819
I'm sorry.

1145
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:33,573
Come on.

1146
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,167
Let's get away from this evil man.

1147
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,834
I'm sorry.

1148
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,216
Yes, so am I.

1149
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,232
Another day? I can't believe it!

1150
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:06,397
This is so exciting!

1151
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,608
I know, right?

1152
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:09,325
Can you believe it?

1153
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,365
Although, things aren't going so great now,

1154
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,664
so maybe last night should've been it!

1155
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,893
This wasn't part of the plan, huh?

1156
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,527
Hello, sweetie.

1157
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:45,937
Come in.

1158
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,532
I'm so sorry about your home.

1159
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,619
It's all my fault. I should never
have invited him into our lives.

1160
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,366
He's such an idiot,
and going after you like that

1161
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,785
when you've done
absolutely nothing to goad him.

1162
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,538
You're just going about your business,

1163
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,369
a complete innocent.

1164
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:09,052
Sad truth is, though,
I actually kind of fell for him.

1165
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,134
I could have loved him, even.

1166
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,892
I should see about a train ticket.

1167
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,870
I messed up, guys.

1168
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:39,616
Really bad.

1169
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,336
<i>If this were based on a different
kind of storybook,</i>

1170
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,873
<i>Peter's parents would say something like...</i>

1171
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,461
You haven't really been trying
to protect Bea.

1172
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,544
You're just scared of losing her.

1173
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,387
But sharing love is not losing love.

1174
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,927
Love is infinite.

1175
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:58,052
You think we loved you any less
after we had the girls?

1176
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,812
Be honest with yourself, Peter,
and go with your heart.

1177
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,772
You've got a good one.

1178
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,726
<i>But it's not based on that kind of storybook,</i>

1179
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,981
<i>so this is what they said.</i>

1180
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:36,464
Thomas!

1181
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,140
I thought it was you.

1182
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,642
I've been trying to call you.

1183
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,012
I'm sorry, there's
no reception in Windermere.

1184
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:43,187
How barbaric.

1185
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,974
On the contrary,
it's one of its many beauties.

1186
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,225
I have some good news.

1187
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,276
Bannerman's no longer with us.

1188
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:53,072
- He died.
- Earring infection in both ears.

1189
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,572
Said it was the stress
of working here for one day.

1190
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,532
Quit, moved to France, of course.

1191
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,701
- I'm sorry, is he dead?
- No.

1192
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,000
I thought maybe "moving
to France" was a euphemism.

1193
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,289
The job's yours if you want it,

1194
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:08,291
pending a psychological evaluation,

1195
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,214
but you seem much better.

1196
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,374
Interested?

1197
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,546
Where would I find men's scarves?

1198
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,714
- Lower ground.
- Lower ground.

1199
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,797
Just take the escalator down.
Right, right, left.

1200
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,882
With your hip-to-waist ratio,
I'd suggest a green check.

1201
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:20,508
You work here?

1202
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:21,926
Do you?

1203
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:23,970
Do you?

1204
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,471
I'm thinking.

1205
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,518
- Do you?
- I...

1206
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,195
I'm gonna go make this right.

1207
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,239
I've wrecked our home.

1208
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:40,954
I've wrecked Bea's home.

1209
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,788
I'm a real home-wrecker.

1210
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,124
Think I'm using that expression properly.

1211
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,785
I got us into this,

1212
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:48,628
and I let you all down.

1213
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,083
I'm really sorry.

1214
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,041
I prepared a speech.

1215
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,380
"I got us into this,

1216
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,007
"and I let you all down.

1217
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,129
"I'm really sorry."

1218
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,348
I guess that was the whole thing.

1219
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,221
Kind of crushed it the first time.

1220
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,600
I should've listened to you, Benjamin.

1221
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,485
Not just about this, about everything.

1222
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,654
You're so much wiser than me.

1223
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,405
It wasn't about the garden.

1224
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,028
I don't know where I'd be without you.

1225
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,326
In a pie, probably.

1226
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,236
Probably.

1227
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,531
And I should've been a better big brother.

1228
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:27,912
Truth is,

1229
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,710
I'm a little lost without Mum and Dad.

1230
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,084
I miss them so much.

1231
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:33,874
- So do we.
- Yeah.

1232
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,166
Me, too.

1233
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:47,849
So, are we good?

1234
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,522
This was pretty bad,

1235
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,315
even for you.

1236
01:11:57,939 --> 01:11:59,282
I'm scared, Peter.

1237
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,239
Don't be. I'm gonna fix this.

1238
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:03,862
- What should we do?
- Just make sure

1239
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,616
she doesn't leave until I get back.

1240
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,869
Should we break both ankles or just one?

1241
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,498
I'm sorry, that was weird.

1242
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:13,330
- Both.
- What?

1243
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,665
Just stall her. I won't let you down.

1244
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,625
- I promise.
- You can count on us.

1245
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,382
Also, I didn't kill old McGregor.

1246
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,134
He died of a heart attack.

1247
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:24,807
- We know.
- The whole time.

1248
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:27,097
- We thought you needed a victory.
- Okay, then.

1249
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,681
<i>Laser-focused</i>

1250
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,933
<i>with a half thought-out plan,</i>

1251
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,607
<i>this is what a hero looks like.</i>

1252
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,643
<i>Or a lunatic.</i>

1253
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,525
<i>The line between the two is very blurry.</i>

1254
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,487
Okay, listen up.
Here's what we're going to do.

1255
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,863
Wait, why do you get to be in charge?

1256
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,990
Because I'm the oldest.

1257
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,988
By 16 seconds.

1258
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,453
Mopsy. Sweet, sweet Mopsy.

1259
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,378
Wait, you both know
that I'm the oldest, right?

1260
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,797
Here we go, just gotta... Sorry.

1261
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:04,006
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1262
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,764
Sorry. Sorry. Oh, no, it's leaving.

1263
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,055
Wait for me!

1264
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,431
Benjamin!

1265
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:14,936
You're coming with me?

1266
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:18,111
Yes, it's my character flaw.

1267
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,858
But there's no other character

1268
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:24,067
I'd rather have a flaw for than you...

1269
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,028
I'm so glad you came.

1270
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,992
I feel terrible that I hurt you.

1271
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,493
I prepared a speech.

1272
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,075
"I feel terrible that..."

1273
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,242
Benjamin!

1274
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,329
No! Benjamin, I'm sorry!

1275
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,664
Run! Run, jump! You can do it!

1276
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:38,793
You can... Yes!

1277
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,967
Peter, you're a terrible apologizer.

1278
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:55,641
Excuse me, town mouse,
do you know how to get to Harrods?

1279
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,724
Absolutely.

1280
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,768
Are you boys from the country?

1281
01:13:58,851 --> 01:13:59,852
How can you tell?

1282
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,234
Brown on brown. It's a bit matchy-matchy.

1283
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,111
Come with me, I'll give you the grand tour.

1284
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,779
Thanks. We're kind of in a hurry.

1285
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,202
Plenty to see along the way.

1286
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:09,779
Tower Bridge.

1287
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,414
Buckingham Palace.

1288
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,033
Guards wearing beavers.

1289
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,370
Big Ben.

1290
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,622
Much larger than I thought.

1291
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,456
View of the skyline.

1292
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,709
It's just stunning, but, Johnny,

1293
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,712
we're on a time-sensitive mission,

1294
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,877
and it seems like you're drawing it out a bit

1295
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,712
because of pride for your hometown.

1296
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:29,137
London's one of the most culturally
significant cities in the world.

1297
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:31,929
What kind of host would I be
if I didn't share it with you?

1298
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:35,184
You're right, if we're actually here,
we should see everything.

1299
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,520
Thanks, Johnny, we owe you one.

1300
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,820
My pleasure. Always happy
to help out a fellow rodent.

1301
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,606
Rodent?

1302
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:50,695
It's a shame.

1303
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,703
But don't worry, I'll get you
to the train on time.

1304
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,297
- Yes!
- Yes!

1305
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,431
Who would do such a thing?

1306
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,683
I have many enemies.

1307
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,107
Okay, he's got to be here.

1308
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,897
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

1309
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,655
A talking bunny doll?

1310
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:32,404
I am a rabbit.

1311
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,284
I like carrots.

1312
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,626
This isn't happening. He's just an illusion.

1313
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:49,212
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

1314
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,925
Mr. McGregor.

1315
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,177
Remember me from before?

1316
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,268
No, no, no, no! I just want to talk.

1317
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,932
I just want to talk.

1318
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:01,061
Rabbits don't talk! I knew you could talk!

1319
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:04,651
Wait, are you talking
or am I just hallucinating?

1320
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,651
Call Security. He's gone crackers again.

1321
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:10,608
You ruined my life!

1322
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:14,987
McGregor!

1323
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,539
You got to come back with us.

1324
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,996
Back to Bea. She's about to leave.

1325
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,039
She's gonna give up painting and go home.

1326
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,541
She wants nothing to do with me.

1327
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,835
That's because she thinks
this is all your fault.

1328
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:29,090
But we both know that I had
a little tiny something to do with it.

1329
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,461
"Little"?

1330
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,550
- "Tiny"?
- Okay, a lot.

1331
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,382
I'm not good at owning up to my mistakes.

1332
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:35,717
I'm working on it.

1333
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,598
- McGregor!
- I just hope it's not too late.

1334
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,805
I let her down.

1335
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:41,931
It's over.

1336
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,224
It's not.

1337
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,770
I just wanted you gone.

1338
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,522
I didn't think of anyone but myself.

1339
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,229
I'm sorry I electrocuted you.

1340
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,814
I'm sorry I put traps on your head.

1341
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,736
I'm sorry I rubbed my butt on your hairbrush.

1342
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,443
Wait. Wait. What?

1343
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,119
Nothing. Stay focused.

1344
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,243
Please come back. Not for me.

1345
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,833
- For Bea.
- How do I know this isn't a trick?

1346
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,661
You don't.

1347
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,166
You just have to trust me.

1348
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,339
Trust us.

1349
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,088
So you really are talking?

1350
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,712
No. Like you said,

1351
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,548
you chilled out, man. You're cool now.

1352
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,428
And you're listening to your heart.

1353
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:18,596
That's what you're hearing.

1354
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,553
McGregor! Unlock this door!

1355
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,637
Now listen to your heart.

1356
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,518
It's telling you to turn left, run six
paces to that window, break it open,

1357
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,350
and let's get the heck out of here!

1358
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,987
McGregor! Open up!

1359
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,652
McGregor!

1360
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,248
<i>And so, the two former enemies</i>

1361
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,253
<i>and one of their cousins
set out across the country,</i>

1362
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,631
<i>a ticking clock their common adversary.</i>

1363
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,258
<i>It was dangerous, gutsy, convoluted,</i>

1364
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,840
<i>and, in a story like this,</i>

1365
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,888
<i>pretty much a journey guaranteed to succeed.</i>

1366
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,720
<i>So let's just hit the highlights.</i>

1367
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,688
Everybody, hang on!

1368
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,740
Now!

1369
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,004
Headlights.

1370
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,372
What?

1371
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:31,875
They're not even on.

1372
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,960
Come on! This is ridiculous.

1373
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,505
Okay. Come on. Get out of here. Go.

1374
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,806
I'm fine! I'm fine!

1375
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:48,974
Thomas?

1376
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,943
What are you doing?

1377
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:52,853
You once said

1378
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:55,025
that everyone has a place in this world.

1379
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,902
Well, this is your place,

1380
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,280
and you shouldn't have to leave
because of something I did.

1381
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,411
Were they with you?

1382
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,038
Yes. They came to London.

1383
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,748
- "They came to London"?
- Yes.

1384
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:05,950
To talk me into coming back.

1385
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,127
Well, they probably didn't talk.
It was probably all in my head.

1386
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,666
Well... No. But that's not the point.

1387
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,498
You shouldn't have to leave.

1388
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,254
I'm sorry for everything that I did.

1389
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:17,928
And I love you, Bea.

1390
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,886
You tried to kill them.

1391
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:23,593
You blew up their home.

1392
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,014
You blew up my home.

1393
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,471
'Cause I got caught up
in everything, you know?

1394
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,972
I got caught up in our fight.

1395
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,351
"Our" fight?

1396
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,434
You're still going on about this. Pathetic.

1397
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:32,856
Come on, Betty, let's go.

1398
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,274
It was my fault.

1399
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,152
I take full responsibility.

1400
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:38,569
My hero.

1401
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,368
Finally admitting that he blew up the burrow.

1402
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,404
Not, as you previously claimed,

1403
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:47,117
the button on the detonator
being pushed by a rabbit!

1404
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,224
Hello, sweetie.

1405
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:04,633
Are you okay?

1406
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,231
You were a part of this?

1407
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,566
I told you!

1408
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,317
I did tell you.

1409
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,344
I can't believe this.

1410
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:49,765
It's a lot to process.

1411
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,438
- It really is.
- Yes.

1412
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,186
Please forgive us.

1413
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,911
You mind moving all this out the way?

1414
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,496
I mean, this is our house and all.

1415
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:16,792
Perfect country gem.

1416
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,000
My stupid sister's going to be so jealous.

1417
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,001
I'm sorry. The manor's no longer for sale.

1418
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,179
Yeah, 'cause it's already
been sold. We bought it.

1419
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,298
- Sorry, who are you?
- I'm the man who sold it.

1420
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,009
And also the man who is canceling the sale.

1421
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,594
No. Sale's final.

1422
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,845
You sold it already?

1423
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,266
- Yes, but I...
- You and your husband

1424
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,393
- need to move off now.
- I'm not her husband.

1425
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,850
I just... We're... Although...

1426
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:39,186
- Get up.
- Bea...

1427
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,359
Come on. There's only one way out of this.

1428
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,440
- You with me?
- Yep.

1429
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:44,525
- Absolutely.
- Always.

1430
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:45,905
- Of course.
- Love you guys.

1431
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:48,533
Shall we? It's so cute.

1432
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:51,123
It's like a 3D version of
a storybook, really.

1433
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,496
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

1434
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,126
What is that?

1435
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:03,756
A gross little goblin or something.

1436
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:05,838
Clear off!

1437
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,465
We'll get pest control.

1438
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,265
- Darling.
- Darling.

1439
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,690
No. No, no.

1440
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,067
Absolutely not.

1441
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,571
- Nah, you can have it.
- We'll keep the deposit.

1442
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,865
- Bye!
- Bye! Lovely couple.

1443
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:12,120
So down-to-earth.

1444
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,993
What a mess you made.

1445
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,410
Well done.

1446
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,046
Did you just wink at him?

1447
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,668
I didn't know you could do that.

1448
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,959
There's a lot of things they can do
that you don't know about.

1449
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,043
A lot of things.

1450
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,636
<i>Life's tough when you're scared and small</i>

1451
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,346
<i>Still tough when you're big and tall</i>

1452
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,643
<i>Or wrong side of McGregor's wall</i>

1453
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,896
<i>And suddenly your heart is like a tennis ball</i>

1454
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,235
<i>Up and down, side to side</i>

1455
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,355
<i>Served so hard you'd think you'd died</i>

1456
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,318
<i>No love for you</i>

1457
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:50,241
Help yourselves, sweeties.

1458
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:51,527
Within reason.

1459
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:55,330
<i>No wall could ever split us up</i>

1460
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,326
<i>Ourlove's forever</i>

1461
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,834
<i>No hate</i>

1462
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,418
Streaker!

1463
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:07,505
I'm so sorry this keeps happening.

1464
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:08,969
Mind if I give it a go?

1465
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,006
<i>Life's rough when you feel confused</i>

1466
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,052
<i>Still rough when you hear the news</i>

1467
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,346
<i>That each day got to pick and choose</i>

1468
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,645
<i>The same old sides the mes and yous</i>

1469
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,890
<i>But don't be sad, you're welcome here</i>

1470
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,226
<i>Even certain carnivores are in the clear</i>

1471
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:24,855
<i>I promise you</i>

1472
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,068
<i>Wind blows and heaven knows</i>

1473
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:32,025
<i>That sun can turn to rain</i>

1474
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:36,948
<i>There's nothing much to fear though</i>

1475
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,203
<i>Doors close and we all know</i>

1476
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,081
That love can turn to pain

1477
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:46,170
<i>So let's be each other's heroes</i>

1478
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:49,001
<i>No gate</i>

1479
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:52,588
<i>No wall could ever split us up</i>

1480
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:55,641
<i>Ourlove's forever</i>

1481
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,227
<i>No hate</i>

1482
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,764
<i>No fear could ever keep us down</i>

1483
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,851
<i>We'll stick together</i>

1484
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,028
<i>Life's nice on a sunny day</i>

1485
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,190
<i>French press and a plate of hay</i>

1486
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,526
<i>But some days can't escape the fray</i>

1487
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:15,911
<i>Crazily careening like a bird of prey</i>

1488
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,117
<i>This old house is never locked</i>

1489
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,331
<i>Even Tiggy-Winkles needn't need to knock</i>

1490
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,042
<i>I promise you</i>

1491
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,624
<i>No gate</i>

1492
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:29,127
<i>No wall could ever split us up</i>

1493
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,881
<i>Ourlove's forever</i>

1494
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,758
<i>No hate</i>

1495
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:38,217
<i>No fear could ever keep us down</i>

1496
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,099
<i>We'll stick together</i>

1497
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,981
<i>Did everyone live happily ever after?</i>

1498
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:47,936
<i>Well, of course.
It's the law in these storybooks.</i>

1499
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,732
All you have to do is toss and fluff.

1500
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,281
Toss and fluff. Very simple.
You give it a go.

1501
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:55,734
How's it going? Yes?

1502
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,194
It's good. Going really well.

1503
01:25:57,277 --> 01:25:58,323
How do I know all this?

1504
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,655
I lived through it.

1505
01:25:59,738 --> 01:26:01,741
Grew up a little, lost my lisp,

1506
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,991
and found my voice.

1507
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,914
Wake up, Rooster! I'm telling a story here!

1508
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:09,123
Sorry, I've been up since the
crack of dawn with these kids!

1509
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:13,545
And they're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1510
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,426
That was a great story, Flopsy.
What are you gonna call it?

1511
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:20,183
I'm calling it, "The Tale of Peter Rabbit."

1512
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,931
I love it. But how about

1513
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,058
"The Tale of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy,

1514
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:28,267
"Cotton-Tail, and Benjamin: A Loving Family"?

1515
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,273
Or maybe you had it right the first time.

1516
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:32,605
"Peter Rabbit."

1517
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,943
<i>No gate</i>

1518
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,490
<i>No wall could ever split us up</i>

1519
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,494
<i>Ourlove's forever</i>

1520
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,043
<i>No hate</i>

1521
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:49,625
<i>No fear could ever keep us down</i>

1522
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:53,130
<i>We'll stick together</i>
