00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Greetings from Martin's Movies.

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,800
RUSH HOUR 2

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Thank you.

4
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,867
Someone better call the police.

5
00:02:31,665 --> 00:02:36,669
I wish they all could be
California girls.

6
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:43,300
- The Beach Boys are dope.
- I love Beach Boys.

7
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:47,637
Hey, ladies, how you doin'?
Wait a minute.

8
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,353
Where you goin'?
Let's get some sushi!

9
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,231
Hey! Hey, cutie!

10
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,859
I wish they all could...

11
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:05,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That was my CD!

12
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:08,615
Don't you ever touch
a Chinese man's CD.

13
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,409
You see the way those girls drove off?
They was laughing at us.

14
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,202
Those girls drove off
because of you.

15
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:16,204
All I did was invite them
to have a drink.

16
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,456
You invited them to get naked...

17
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,875
and sacrifice a small goat.

18
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,378
Which word was "goat"?

19
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,005
You owe me a copy of
The Beach Boys' Greatest Hits.

20
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,967
Don't get no attitude with me, Lee.
I've worked your cases for three days.

21
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:33,803
Reason I'm here in Hong Kong is 'cause
you said you'd show me a good time.

22
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:36,640
I'm on vacation, man,
and I want some mu sh...

23
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:39,851
- Mu shu? You hungry?
- No, Lee, not mu sh...

24
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:42,853
Some mu shu.
I wanna see some women, man.

25
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,188
Now stop playin' dumb
and show me to the sh...

26
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,611
There was a bombing at the
U.S. Embassy.

27
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,614
Two American translators
were killed.

28
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:56,198
Any leads?

29
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,285
We think it's Ricky Tan.

30
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,037
His entire gang of Triads
is at the club tonight.

31
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:07,584
If you don't want to take
the case, I'll understand.

32
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:09,418
No, it's okay.

33
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,465
What was that?

34
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:18,927
Did you just take another
damn case on my vacation, man?

35
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:22,513
Of course not. My superintendent
invited us to a club.

36
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,850
- Big party tonight.
- Don't be messin' with me, Lee.

37
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,727
I will slap you so hard,
you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.

38
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,522
I mean it. I'll bitch-slap you
back to Bangkok.

39
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,190
- Big party?
- Big one.

40
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,735
Okay, well,
let's go party then.

41
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,157
Hey, this is nice.
Hey, cutie.

42
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,910
They don't like tourists in here,
so try to blend in.

43
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:50,329
What do you mean, blend in?
I'm two feet taller than everybody here.

44
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,960
- Wait here.
- Where you goin'?

45
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:59,671
- Bathroom.
- Hurry back, 'cause we gonna party.

46
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,435
How you doin'?

47
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:19,189
Come here a lot?
It's a nice place.

48
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:22,692
Take us through the hours

49
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:24,193
I won't make you, baby.

50
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,988
What in the world
is goin' on up in here?

51
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,783
Am I the only one
listenin' to this?

52
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:32,868
The man destroyin' a classic!

53
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:35,953
With the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough.

54
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,372
Keep on with the force
Don't stop.

55
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:41,917
- Don't stop till you get enough.
- Boo!

56
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:46,004
With the force, don't stop
Don't stop till you get enough

57
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,757
I can't take
no more of this, man.

58
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:18,199
Get closer Oh, get closer

59
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,577
I'm burnin' now.

60
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,497
Just love me.

61
00:06:25,623 --> 00:06:27,541
Till you.

62
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,753
Don't know how.

63
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:33,421
Keep on till
the force starts up.

64
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:35,506
Don't stop till you get enough
Keep on.

65
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:39,135
Till the force starts up
Ah, don't stop till you get enough.

66
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:41,220
Keep on
till the force starts up.

67
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:43,388
Come on, girls!

68
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,807
Come on
till the force starts up.

69
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,226
Ah, don't stop
till you get enough.

70
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,316
Come on! Come on!

71
00:06:56,692 --> 00:07:00,111
Come here, girls
Don't stop till you...

72
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,780
Come on, girls
I can't believe it.

73
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,245
Come on, don't stop.
You know you feel the force!

74
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,874
Don't stop till you get enough.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,335
- I feel the force!
- Carter!

76
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,545
Come on! Come on!

77
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,506
- Carter!
- Come on, Lee!

78
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,299
- Carter!
- Come on!

79
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:30,973
I'll be right back
I'll be right back

80
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:33,016
I'll be right back

81
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,518
Lee, these people love me.
Come on out here.

82
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,687
- Get off the stage.
- Are you crazy, man?

83
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,689
I'm a star, a god to these people.
Check this out.

84
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,067
This is a gangster bar.
We are here undercover.

85
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,030
I knew you was lyin'.
I knew you was lyin', man.

86
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,199
- I'm sorry, Carter.
- You a liar!

87
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:54,326
We are here to find Ricky Tan.
We must tread softly.

88
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:57,538
Tread softly?
What in the world you talkin' about?

89
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:00,290
Who taught you how to roust a bar?
"Tread softly."

90
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:04,044
These men are Triads,
the most deadly gang in China.

91
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,754
You think that scare me? I'm from
Los Angeles. We invented gangs.

92
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,965
- Give me that badge.
- No! You are civilian!

93
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,092
In Hong Kong, I am Michael Jackson!
You are Toto!

94
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:15,178
You mean Tito! Toto is what
we ate last night for dinner.

95
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:17,180
- Now give me that badge.
- No!

96
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:24,020
Listen up!

97
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,070
Right now!

98
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:44,954
What did I just say?

99
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,916
You just asked everybody
to pick up their samurai swords...

100
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,419
and shave your butt.

101
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,796
- I said that?
- Yes.

102
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:58,383
Come out here and translate
this for me. Come on.

103
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,385
All right, listen up!

104
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,263
All the Triads
and the ugly women on this side...

105
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:06,515
and all the fine women
on this side right now!

106
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:08,017
Translate it.

107
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:11,603
He wants the men on the right.
And the women on the left.

108
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:16,941
Y'all gonna act like
y'all don't hear what I'm sayin'.

109
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:20,236
Who in here know Ricky Tan?
Raise your hand.

110
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:22,654
Translate.

111
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:26,617
I apologize. My friend is very drunk.

112
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,832
I see what's goin' on here. Okay.

113
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,917
I ain't got time
to be playin' no games now.

114
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,836
Hu Li!

115
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,213
Hey, Lee!

116
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:56,393
Out of the way!
L.A.P. D!

117
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,420
Lee! Hold up!

118
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,343
Hell no.

119
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,098
Lee, I'm takin' the stairs!

120
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:28,808
Move aside, Kobe.

121
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:29,934
Sorry.

122
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:48,576
Sorry for interrupting your meal, sir.

123
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,151
Carter!

124
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,820
Over here!

125
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,615
- Lee!
- Help me!

126
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,702
- How you get down there?
- Hurry up!

127
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:38,954
Hold on!
Don't let go, man.

128
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:42,207
- Here.
- Watch out behind you!

129
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,043
- Behind you!
- What?

130
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,884
Who the hell was that?

131
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:57,346
Lord Jesus, I don't wanna die!

132
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,639
Lee, help me, man!

133
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:03,309
Don't worry.
Chinese bamboo is very strong.

134
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,063
- You sure, man?
- I'm sure.

135
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,037
Let go! Let go!

136
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:28,665
I can't believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit!

137
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,803
I can't believe
you lied to me, man.

138
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,306
- I'm sorry.
- You sorry?

139
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:50,601
I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck up
my ass, and all you say is you sorry?

140
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,854
- There was an explosion.
- I don't give a damn!

141
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:57,273
At the American embassy.
Two Americans were killed.

142
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:01,236
So you think this guy Ricky Tan
blew up the embassy?

143
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:04,613
- I don't know.
- Then why the hell you lookin' for him?

144
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:07,616
- We're gonna find out.
- No, you gonna find out.

145
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:10,911
There's two billion Chinese people here.
Let one of them be your partner.

146
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,751
Where the hell we at now?

147
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,837
Massage parlor.
Heaven on Earth.

148
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,421
This is more like it.

149
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:26,342
I'm about to go in here and get
a massage and a hot tea bath right now.

150
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,469
Just follow my lead.
Act like a tourist.

151
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,470
I am a tourist, fool.

152
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,018
Slow down, Chen!
Hell is wrong with you?

153
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:50,655
My American friend is on vacation.
I want to show him a good time.

154
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,489
Oh, you American.

155
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:55,200
- Yeah.
- You bring American money?

156
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,453
- I got it, Lee.
- You sure?

157
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,372
I'm sure.

158
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:01,664
Thank you.

159
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,750
- You're welcome.
- Right this way.

160
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:15,010
Are you ready?

161
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:18,221
You ready? I'm ready.

162
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:25,268
Oh, my goodness!

163
00:15:25,394 --> 00:15:28,354
This place is off the hook!
I love Hong Kong.

164
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,690
You get massage
from Chinese girl before?

165
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:33,026
No, but I heard
it was the bomb.

166
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:35,194
Come with me.

167
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,697
You pick any girl
for you and your friend.

168
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,740
- Any girl?
- Any girl.

169
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:45,953
I don't know where to start.

170
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:51,625
- I'll take that one. She got to come.
- Yes, she's very nice.

171
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,504
She is nice, but I hurt my back and my
neck, and I need a little more massage.

172
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,839
So I'm gonna take her
in the pink too.

173
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,383
- Oh, yes.
- And let me get her.

174
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:03,136
And let me have her.
Can I get her too?

175
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,346
And her right there.
She good with feet?

176
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:07,597
- Oh, yes.
- What are you doing?

177
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:11,601
- She said I could have any girl I want.
- Well, hurry up!

178
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:15,271
What's wrong with you? Don't jump in
front of a black man in a buffet line.

179
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:16,773
Calm down!

180
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:19,608
Your friend has big appetite.

181
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:24,196
Please, follow her upstairs
into the quiet room.

182
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,656
It ain't gonna be
no quiet room no more.

183
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:34,705
Y'all don't know
how good this feels.

184
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:37,249
I got in a big fight last night
with the Triads.

185
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,044
Y'all ever heard of the Triads?
I beat down like 20 of 'em.

186
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,212
Y'all should've seen me.
It was on.

187
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,634
This is what I'm talkin' about, man.
Now I'm on vacation.

188
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,096
I knew you'd come through.
I just knew it.

189
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,764
America?

190
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,059
Wanna come to America with me?
Ever been to America?

191
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,561
How's your girl?

192
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,230
- Lee, what's wrong?
- That's Ricky Tan.

193
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,692
That's Ricky Tan?
That's a midget in a bathrobe!

194
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,819
I will call for backup.

195
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,029
He's four feet tall.
Let's bust him now.

196
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,616
- He's a very dangerous man.
- I'm a very dangerous man.

197
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,785
Look, let's go over there
and bust him.

198
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,121
You're not about to mess up
my massage, I'm telling you.

199
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:21,288
Stay here.

200
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,332
You don't need backup.
I got your back...

201
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:29,712
Excuse me for a minute.
Just for a minute.

202
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:35,093
I'll be back. Don't...

203
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,135
I'll be back.

204
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:41,556
Ricky? Ricky Tan?

205
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,892
Get up, dog. I've been
lookin' for you everywhere.

206
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,352
I'm busy at the moment.

207
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,521
You hear what I said? I'm busy too.
Now get on your feet.

208
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:51,982
- Get on your feet!
- I know you.

209
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,317
You are Lee's
American friend, right?

210
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:57,237
I'm Lee's new muscle.
Don't let this robe fool you.

211
00:17:57,404 --> 00:18:00,239
This is the only color they had.
Now I said, get up.

212
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,241
I ain't gonna say it again.

213
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,161
You American are so funny.

214
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:08,539
And you Asians
don't hear that well.

215
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,209
Little Ricky!

216
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:15,712
Get your little punk ass up...

217
00:18:15,837 --> 00:18:18,130
outta that chair right now!

218
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:23,302
You're messin' up my vacation.
I told you to get up, didn't I?

219
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:25,095
Now I gotta go off on you.

220
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,014
Let me bust his ass.
Come on!

221
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,807
What?
Let me take care of this.

222
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:30,850
Hello, my friend, how are you?

223
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:32,518
I need to talk to you.

224
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,978
What about?

225
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:36,355
The two Americans that were killed.

226
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:37,940
Come to the police station.

227
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:40,484
The police station?

228
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:44,320
If you have any questions, ask me
here.

229
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:49,032
Look, little man.
You comin' with...

230
00:18:49,158 --> 00:18:51,076
Oh, my Lord.

231
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,495
I would like to pay you
for that laptop.

232
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:55,581
- I think I should do that.
- No problem.

233
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:57,999
I seen it on the Internet,
with a DVD player.

234
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,627
- That's an old model.
- Now, I must excuse myself.

235
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:02,503
Inspector.

236
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:04,380
Have a good day.

237
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:09,134
I was...

238
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:15,265
Lee, why didn't you tell me
this man rolls like this?

239
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,183
- I told you already!
- No, you didn't!

240
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:18,892
- What you said?
- I did this.

241
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:20,852
What do this mean?
Speak English to me!

242
00:19:20,978 --> 00:19:23,480
That means I go this way
and you go this way.

243
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:25,983
- I go that way, you go this way?
- Yes.

244
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:43,915
- Sorry.
- Carter!

245
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,792
Y'all look alike!
Watch out!

246
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:17,194
No wonder you mad.

247
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:32,291
Don't worry. It's okay.

248
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:37,546
You better get
the hell outta here.

249
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,555
- Flip me!
- What?

250
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:49,056
Flip me!

251
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:50,975
Damn!

252
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,852
Lee!

253
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:06,738
No, no, no!

254
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:32,678
Lee!

255
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:46,190
YAU MA TEI POLICE STATION

256
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:50,277
Look, you've been ordered
by the Ministry of Public Security...

257
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:54,281
to assist the F.B.I. And Secret Service
in our investigation...

258
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:56,699
to provide us
with whatever we need.

259
00:21:56,825 --> 00:22:00,369
You have information,
it belongs to us.

260
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:02,371
This is still Hong Kong.

261
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:07,042
Two Americans have been killed
on United States government property.

262
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:09,044
Give me two copies of that.

263
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,462
This is our investigation.

264
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:14,632
Chief Inspector Lee
will supervise your people.

265
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:16,968
No, he will report to me.

266
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:19,345
Do we understand each other?

267
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,059
What the hell is that?

268
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,645
That is, uh...

269
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:31,439
Chief Inspector Lee.

270
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:34,024
I ain't never been humiliated
and embarrassed like that...

271
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,026
in my whole entire life.

272
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:39,655
Got me runnin' around Hong Kong
butt-naked, thanks to you.

273
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,656
- Thanks to me?
- Yeah, thanks to you.

274
00:22:41,782 --> 00:22:43,867
You needed backup,
so I gave you backup.

275
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:47,286
I was about to kick Ricky Tan's ass, and
his bodyguards', till you messed it up.

276
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:50,372
- Stop. I'm sick of your bullshit.
- I'm sick of you!

277
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:52,916
I'm not the one runnin' up
in karaoke bars full of gangsters.

278
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:56,086
And I'm not the one runnin' up in
massage parlors lookin' for crime lords.

279
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:58,337
- It's my job.
- It's your job.

280
00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:01,006
You pitiful, man.
When are you gonna have some fun?

281
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:04,051
When are you gonna take a day off?
When are you gonna go on a date?

282
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:07,054
- I have plenty of dates.
- When's the last time you had a date?

283
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,014
When's the last time you played
"hide the rainbow roll"?

284
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,226
Huh? Let's hear it, Lee.
The Year of the Rat?

285
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,311
You will never understand me.

286
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:18,648
You right, 'cause I didn't even
understand what you just said to me.

287
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,447
They got my passport
back at that massage parlor.

288
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,201
Good afternoon, sir.

289
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,870
- Lee?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:37,873
This is Special Agent Sterling
from the United States Secret Service.

291
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,874
Secret Service? Why?

292
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,876
Have a seat, please.

293
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,214
What I'm about to tell you
cannot leave this room.

294
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:50,217
The men who were killed yesterday
were not American translators.

295
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,845
They were undercover
United States Customs agents...

296
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,013
trying to break
a Triad smuggling ring.

297
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:57,015
- Smuggling what?
- We don't know.

298
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,183
But whatever it is,
it got the agents killed.

299
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:03,271
How can we help you?

300
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:05,648
You can stay the hell
out of our way.

301
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:11,611
- Thank you.
- I can get you Ricky Tan.

302
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:14,071
No. We know all about Tan.

303
00:24:14,197 --> 00:24:16,407
That's why we're leaving
him out there as bait.

304
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:19,285
This is a lot bigger
than Ricky Tan...

305
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,953
and the Fu Cang Long Triads.

306
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:28,835
Hey, cutie.

307
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:52,314
Thank you, Lee.

308
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,717
Carter! Carter!

309
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:28,012
Heaven on Earth massage parlor?

310
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:31,724
Heaven on Earth?

311
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,976
Hello. Cheap suits.

312
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:38,188
Hello. Cheap suits.
Cheap suits.

313
00:25:38,314 --> 00:25:40,524
- Cheap suits. Cheap suits.
- How cheap?

314
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:43,359
- Cheap suits.
- Cheap as hell?

315
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,792
Excuse me.

316
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:05,212
Can you direct me to Heaven on Earth
massage parlor, please?

317
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:08,090
- Hello. How are you?
- Okay.

318
00:26:09,842 --> 00:26:11,843
No, no.
Wait a minute.

319
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:13,886
I don't want no chicken.

320
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:20,350
I don't want no chicken!
What am I gonna do with a chicken?

321
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:23,395
I don't like
my chickens live, okay?

322
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,855
I like 'em dead and deep-fried.
You ever heard of Popeye's?

323
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:31,527
No, no! No!
Don't kill chicken.

324
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:34,071
Yes.

325
00:26:34,197 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm warning you.
I'm a police officer.

326
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:38,742
Put the blade down
and let the bird go right now!

327
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,917
You okay, Lee?

328
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:54,256
All he wanted was some mu sh...

329
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:10,437
Damn.

330
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,357
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

331
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:19,570
Follow that car.

332
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:24,657
Follow that limo. This is a chase.
Wherever he goes, you go.

333
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:28,286
You're not movin'!
This is the opposite of chasin'!

334
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:32,582
What? I will slap you
if you don't move this car.

335
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:35,501
I'm gonna slap you.
I'm gonna slap you.

336
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:38,420
All right.
Okay, look. Here.

337
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,463
You understand that?

338
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,719
- Now you're speaking my language.
- Get the hell on then.

339
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:48,929
Come on, let's go!

340
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:42,102
We just heard Ricky Tan is throwing
a party on his boat tonight.

341
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:44,479
Did you tell Sterling?

342
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:48,649
Let him find out on his own. I want
the Hong Kong Police handling this.

343
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,760
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

344
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,845
- You understand?
- Yes, I understand!

345
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,139
And don't eat my chicken, okay?

346
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,101
Jesus!

347
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,676
How you doin', baby?

348
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:56,179
Carter, James Carter.
Baldwin Hills.

349
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:58,389
Isabella Molina.
From San Juan.

350
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:00,725
San Juan?
I know San Juan.

351
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,852
I've traveled there many times
on my private plane.

352
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:09,024
You must know my friend Pedro Morales
Magonzales Marato Molaso Mondustos.

353
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:11,401
- I don't think so.
- You sure?

354
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:14,236
Well, I'm sorry. I thought
you rode in the best circles.

355
00:31:14,362 --> 00:31:16,572
But listen.
Make yourself feel at home.

356
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:20,783
You need anything... champagne,
caviar... my yacht is your yacht.

357
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:23,578
This is your yacht?

358
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:25,747
That's right.
I'm the owner.

359
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:28,582
The captain.
El capitan.

360
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,794
- El capitan?
- Yes. Listen.

361
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,588
I'm not gonna play games with you.
I want you right now.

362
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:38,591
I see me and you downstairs
in one of those bathrooms...

363
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,593
in about five minutes.

364
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:44,055
Well, I'm very tempted.
It's such a beautiful yacht.

365
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:47,474
What's it called?

366
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:50,728
- What's it called?
- Mm-hmm. Your yacht.

367
00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:54,898
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson.
- The S.S. Minnow Johnson?

368
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:57,692
Funny. The name on the back
was The Red Dragon.

369
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,610
The Red Dragon?
Are you sure?

370
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:03,029
Oh, I'm sure.
Because this is my friend's yacht.

371
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:05,282
- Your friend's yacht?
- And this is his party.

372
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:09,118
I must've got on the wrong yacht.
All these yachts look alike these days.

373
00:32:09,286 --> 00:32:12,205
I knew somethin' was wrong
when my key didn't work.

374
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,500
- Who's your friend?
- Somebody on the wrong yacht.

375
00:32:16,626 --> 00:32:19,461
Wait a second. I know you.
Steven Reign, right?

376
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:22,756
You own half of Los Angeles.
What you doin' here in Hong Kong?

377
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:25,091
I'm here for the weekend,
taking in the sights.

378
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:28,303
You must have your own plane too.
It's fun, ain't it?

379
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:31,013
- Shall we?
- Yes.

380
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:34,724
Well, enjoy the party,
Mr. Carter.

381
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,726
I plan to, Ms. Isabella.

382
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:40,313
See you later, Stevie.
Be cool.

383
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:56,828
- Ricky Tan. Where is he?
- I don't know!

384
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:59,913
He killed a detective today.
Where is he?

385
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,748
Who got killed, man?

386
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,752
- Carter!
- Who died, Lee?

387
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:06,837
- You!
- Detective Yu?

388
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,838
- Not Yu, you!
- Who?

389
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:10,340
- You!
- Who?

390
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:14,301
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

391
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,971
Don't nobody understand the words
that are comin' out of your mouth, man.

392
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:20,640
Ricky Tan is waiting for you.

393
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:28,439
What the hell
is going on here, Lee?

394
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:31,108
Remember I told you
my father was a policeman?

395
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:33,360
- Ricky Tan was his partner.
- What?

396
00:33:33,736 --> 00:33:35,821
Hu Li, you disappoint me.

397
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:38,906
Have you forgotten where you're
from?

398
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,035
Don't forget who you work for.

399
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:45,704
You think you could ever be a
leader?

400
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,589
Lee, I've been expecting you.

401
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:58,716
Please ask your partner
to wait inside.

402
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:01,384
- I ain't goin' nowhere.
- It's okay.

403
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,138
- I'm not leavin' you alone.
- I'll be fine.

404
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:06,264
- You sure?
- Yes.

405
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:09,893
I'll be right upstairs.

406
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:14,814
I know what everybody's saying.

407
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:17,858
I did not blow up
the American embassy.

408
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:19,901
I'm not that stupid.

409
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:24,030
But I believe
some of my people did.

410
00:34:24,156 --> 00:34:27,742
My enemies
are trying to frame me.

411
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:31,245
There is a war going on
right now within the Triads.

412
00:34:32,621 --> 00:34:34,539
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose this time.

413
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:39,043
If your father were still alive,
I would turn to him for advice.

414
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:41,462
Please don't.

415
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:44,799
Lee, I really need your help.
I cannot trust anybody else.

416
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:47,551
Tell me why they killed
the customs agents.

417
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,512
I'll give you all
the information you need...

418
00:34:50,637 --> 00:34:54,557
but you've gotta get me
out of Hong Kong right away.

419
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,430
Lady, what are you doin'?

420
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,932
Get down.
I'm L.A.P.D.

421
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:46,354
You just kick me?
You must be outta your mind!

422
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,815
You want some of me? I'm gonna
give you an L.A.P.D. Ass-kickin'!

423
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:18,048
- You okay?
- Yeah.

424
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:20,884
I slipped and I fell. Hey.

425
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,969
- What?
- Am I bleedin'?

426
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,900
Quite a night, Inspector.

427
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:42,236
Ricky Tan was our only bait.
Now he's gone.

428
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:46,740
So you got your revenge, at the expense
of a U.S. Government investigation.

429
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:48,742
What are you talkin'
about, revenge?

430
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:51,662
Now, I don't know if the Triads
paid you to get rid of Tan...

431
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,122
or if it was a pure
vendetta killing...

432
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:57,666
or if you're involved in the smuggling
yourself, but you're off this case.

433
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,169
I don't ever wanna see you again.
Is that clear?

434
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:03,129
- What's goin' on here?
- Carter, you're in enough trouble.

435
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,007
Just shut up.
Stay out of it.

436
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,176
You're goin' back to L.A.
Right now.

437
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:12,012
That's fine with me, man.
I ain't had fun since I been out here.

438
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,851
Sorry, Lee.

439
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:21,355
Escort Detective Carter
to the airport.

440
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,150
I'll take him.

441
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:26,692
Get your hands off!

442
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:38,453
- Carter, you don't understand.
- I understand, all right.

443
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,955
I got knocked off a building,
I got beat on...

444
00:37:41,081 --> 00:37:44,750
I got stripped butt-naked,
and you held out on me, man.

445
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:47,044
I'm outta here.

446
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,386
Carter, Ricky Tan
set up my father.

447
00:37:57,929 --> 00:37:59,180
What?

448
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:08,271
Five years ago, my father was working
a big international smuggling case.

449
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:11,315
He found out his partner, Tan,
was working for the Triads.

450
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,569
But before he could prove it,
he was killed.

451
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,655
All the evidence disappeared...

452
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,240
Tan resigned,
and the case was never solved.

453
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:24,827
I get it now. This is all about
your daddy's last case.

454
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,209
You gettin' on the plane
with me or not?

455
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,501
What?

456
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:36,379
You know my daddy
died on the job too.

457
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:39,340
If I had a chance to square his death,
I'd do whatever it took.

458
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:42,885
I'd do anything.
So you comin' or what?

459
00:38:48,974 --> 00:38:50,141
Why L. A?

460
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:56,897
Lee, let me introduce you to Carter's
theory of criminal investigation:

461
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:58,899
Follow the rich white man.

462
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:02,861
- Follow the rich white man?
- Exactly. Now you're learning.

463
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:06,447
Every big crime has a rich white man
behind it waitin' for his cut.

464
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:08,950
Now in our case,
we know who the rich white man is.

465
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:10,951
- Steven Reign.
- Who?

466
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,829
Steven Reign, the hotel billionaire.
I saw him on Ricky Tan's boat.

467
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,331
When the shootin' started,
he was way too cool.

468
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:18,959
When people start shootin',
white people ain't that cool.

469
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,377
They either runnin' around,
hidin' behind tables...

470
00:39:21,503 --> 00:39:24,547
or screamin' like, "aah!"

471
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:26,257
You sound like that
all the time.

472
00:39:26,382 --> 00:39:28,342
Let me tell you somethin'
about black people.

473
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:30,845
When stuff goes down,
we keep our cool.

474
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:34,181
Maybe, but not like Asians.
We never panic.

475
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,933
Right. When Godzilla's comin',
y'all be trippin'.

476
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:39,686
I seen the movie.
You be, "Gaica, gaica!"

477
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,645
Yellin' everywhere.
I seen Chinamen...

478
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,272
Mr. Carter, excuse me.

479
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:45,650
Thank you so much.
It's the kosher meal?

480
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:48,902
- Yes, that is our kosher meal.
- Shalom.

481
00:39:54,532 --> 00:39:56,867
REIGN TOWERS Los Angeles.

482
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:05,083
There he is, right there,
Mr. Steven Reign...

483
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:07,836
livin' large in one
of his penthouse suites.

484
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,549
Oh, guess who this is.
Yep, that's her.

485
00:40:13,674 --> 00:40:16,676
That's the woman that was
on Ricky Tan's boat, right there.

486
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:18,386
We got 'em.

487
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:21,222
Told you it'd work out.
Know what I'm talkin' about.

488
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,308
All we gotta do now is wait.

489
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:26,101
They still talkin'?

490
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:28,979
He's leaving.

491
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:31,065
- He'll be back.
- How do you know?

492
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,316
I know. You see how fine
that woman is?

493
00:40:33,442 --> 00:40:35,527
He'll definitely be back.

494
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,659
What's she doing?

495
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:48,413
What's she doin', man?

496
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:51,416
She's just standing around,
not doing much.

497
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:55,794
Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later,
something's gonna happen.

498
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,673
Okay, I just try to stay awake.
It's just so boring.

499
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,513
Oh. Slow down, baby.

500
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:07,805
What?

501
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:11,851
- Nothing. I said nothing.
- You said somethin'.

502
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:13,810
- I said nothing.
- I heard you.

503
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:16,188
No. Nothing.

504
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,367
Lee, what's goin' on?
What you talkin' about?

505
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:33,287
- She's getting undressed.
- What?

506
00:41:33,412 --> 00:41:35,622
- She's just getting undressed.
- Give me that!

507
00:41:35,747 --> 00:41:38,833
No! It's not right!

508
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:41,502
- Lord, have mercy!
- What?

509
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:44,171
- She took her skirt off.
- I cannot hear this.

510
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:46,674
Black panties, black bra...

511
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:50,885
Victoria's Secret,
spring catalogue, page 27.

512
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:52,512
Girl got class.

513
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:55,472
Let me look a little closer.
Oh, look at that.

514
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:57,599
Got a little tattoo.
That's cute.

515
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,851
Looks like Snoopy.

516
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,395
- Snoopy?
- Yeah.

517
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,689
- I love Snoopy.
- I love Snoopy too. Let me look.

518
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,733
Hold up.
Wait a minute.

519
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,527
She's goin' to the door.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

520
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,571
She's openin' the door.

521
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,575
Look like somebody
droppin' off a package.

522
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,702
Wait a minute.

523
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,455
Look like the same girl who dropped
off the package at your office.

524
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:23,998
It's a bomb!

525
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,751
Watch out!

526
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:34,423
It's this one right here.
Lady, you got a bomb in there!

527
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:36,384
Open that door!

528
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:38,385
Kick the door.

529
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:43,557
- Damn, you fine.
- Carter!

530
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:47,394
- Come on, Lee!
- Where?

531
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,730
- Don't drop it! This way!
- Where should we go?

532
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,985
Roof! Roof!

533
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:59,071
Don't trip! Be careful!

534
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:04,409
- Throw it, Lee!
- Where?

535
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:07,329
Lee, throw it!
Throw the bomb over the edge!

536
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:08,830
Throw it! Throw it!

537
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:11,165
- Throw it over the edge!
- There's people down there!

538
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,960
- Lee, throw it!
- Carter!

539
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:16,337
- Lee! Throw it!
- No!

540
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:18,338
We about to die!

541
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,429
Okay, get on your feet.

542
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:29,681
- Enough, all right?
- Put that down!

543
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,683
- It's a bomb!
- Put that down!

544
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,728
Guys, no bomb.
Nothing.

545
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:38,522
Now stay away before I throw you
both in jail for obstruction.

546
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,649
Throw us in jail?

547
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:43,485
You must be outta your mind.
I'm about to bust you right now.

548
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:46,571
I'm an undercover agent for
the United States Secret Service.

549
00:43:46,697 --> 00:43:49,407
How do we know that?
Show me a badge right now.

550
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:51,493
Here you go.

551
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:56,205
Let me see that again.
I didn't get a good look at that.

552
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:59,041
We can help you.
I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

553
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:01,709
I know who you are,
Inspector Lee. I know.

554
00:44:01,835 --> 00:44:05,171
We need to go out of sight,
so come down to my suite.

555
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:10,676
- Why did you say it was a bomb?
- No, you said that.

556
00:44:10,802 --> 00:44:13,012
- No, you said it.
- You said that in the hotel room.

557
00:44:13,137 --> 00:44:15,097
I said she was the bomb.

558
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:18,641
She was the bomb?

559
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:21,561
Look, I've been working
this case for months now...

560
00:44:21,686 --> 00:44:23,687
so if I seem a little
aggravated, I apologize.

561
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:25,689
You need to tell us
what's goin' on.

562
00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:28,442
The Triads and Reign think
I'm a crooked customs agent.

563
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:31,778
- Is that a payoff?
- No. That's a sample.

564
00:44:31,904 --> 00:44:33,905
You guys ever heard
of the Superbill?

565
00:44:34,031 --> 00:44:36,408
I heard of it. It's a myth.
Some kind of counterfeit.

566
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:39,994
Honey, it's much more
than a counterfeit.

567
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,288
Fourteen out of fifteen world banks
can't even tell the difference.

568
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,998
The paper is Crane linen blend...

569
00:44:45,124 --> 00:44:48,001
and the bills are printed
on U.S. Intaglio presses.

570
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:51,004
You wanna tell us how they get into
the U.S. Mint to use the presses?

571
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:54,673
In 1959, the United States was
very friendly with the Shah of Iran.

572
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:57,176
Why? Because we wanted his oil.

573
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,177
Our government
gave him a gift...

574
00:44:59,303 --> 00:45:01,263
a U.S. Treasury
intaglio printing press.

575
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,556
Now, it's the only one
to ever leave the country.

576
00:45:03,682 --> 00:45:06,267
Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought
the press on the black market.

577
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:08,102
Five years ago?

578
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:10,188
That's right before
he left the force.

579
00:45:10,313 --> 00:45:13,899
Ricky Tan got hold of one-of-a-kind
Swiss-made hundred-dollar plates...

580
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:15,901
and he started printing
Superbills.

581
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:18,695
That's why Hu Li killed him...
for the plates.

582
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,865
And they've printed and shipped
one hundred million dollars.

583
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,662
There's only one way
to spot a fake.

584
00:45:28,788 --> 00:45:31,748
They use an optical transfer ink
from India that burns red.

585
00:45:31,874 --> 00:45:35,627
You see? Now, the real ink,
it burns black.

586
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:42,883
You know, Carter, I believe
you're asking the wrong question.

587
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,636
The real question is,
where are the plates?

588
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:50,140
Because if we can find the plates,
we can stop the whole operation.

589
00:45:50,265 --> 00:45:53,017
- Right?
- Yeah, you're right.

590
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,936
Maybe this is where
you can help us, guys.

591
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:59,356
Yeah. Carter,
this is your city, right?

592
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,651
Yeah, this is my titty.
I mean, this is my city.

593
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:06,779
Great. And Lee, you know
Hu Li and the Triads, correct?

594
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:08,906
- Yes.
- Great.

595
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,993
Can you do me a favor? Can you find out
where Hu Li's keeping the plates?

596
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,287
- That ain't no problem.
- Thank you.

597
00:46:15,412 --> 00:46:17,372
So welcome aboard, gentlemen.

598
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:21,418
From now on, you're officially working
for the United States Secret Service.

599
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:26,880
Secret Service agent
James Carter.

600
00:46:27,006 --> 00:46:30,258
That sounds good.
It's got a nice ring to it, don't it?

601
00:46:30,384 --> 00:46:32,260
I'm tellin' you, Lee,
give me six months.

602
00:46:32,386 --> 00:46:35,889
Six months and I'll be in Washington,
D.C., protectin' the president.

603
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:38,641
We both know you would never
take a bullet for someone else.

604
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:40,642
Yeah, but they don't know that.

605
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:43,311
I'm gonna talk to Isabella,
see if she can hook somethin' up.

606
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:47,315
- Seein' how she stared at a brother.
- She never even look at you.

607
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:49,901
Just jealous, Lee,
'cause the girl chose me...

608
00:46:50,026 --> 00:46:53,404
'cause I'm tall, dark and handsome,
and you Third-World ugly.

609
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,740
I'm not Third-World ugly.
Women like me.

610
00:46:55,865 --> 00:46:58,992
They think I'm cute,
like Snoopy.

611
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:01,953
Lee, Snoopy is six inches
taller than you.

612
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:09,168
Lee and Carter are officially
out of the Secret Service's way.

613
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,169
Correct.

614
00:47:29,854 --> 00:47:33,357
This is my informant's place.
They got pretty good ribs here too.

615
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:35,358
I like kosher.

616
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:45,992
Hey. Hey, wait.

617
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:56,919
Oh, I know I don't think I see
what I see what I'm thinkin'!

618
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:59,421
I know good and well
y'all ain't gamblin' back here!

619
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:02,424
- This is supposed to be a restaurant!
- What you doin' here, James?

620
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:05,051
You about to go to jail,
and all your little friends.

621
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:07,679
Everybody pack up your stuff
and let's get outta here.

622
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,264
- All right, let's talk outside.
- You wanna talk outside?

623
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,265
Yes.

624
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,476
Let's go if you wanna talk.
As long as you wanna talk.

625
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:20,064
Where you get that from?
I like that.

626
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,316
That's good.
What's up, Kenny?

627
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,277
- James Carter.
- What's up?

628
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:29,156
I heard you was gettin' your ass kicked
out there in Hong Kong, brother.

629
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,157
- What?
- That's right.

630
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,493
- Who told you that?
- I got my sources.

631
00:48:33,618 --> 00:48:36,203
- Don't you worry about that.
- They tellin' you lies.

632
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:38,956
Look, I'm about to bust you
if you don't give me some information.

633
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,251
How you gonna come up here
and jam me up like this, James?

634
00:48:42,376 --> 00:48:46,462
You embarrass me in front
of my wife, my kids out there.

635
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:48,464
Kenny, you embarrassin' yourself.

636
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,133
You a black man with
a Chinese restaurant on Crenshaw.

637
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:54,386
You come up in here,
you ain't show me no badge.

638
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:56,472
You ain't even
flashed a warrant.

639
00:48:56,597 --> 00:49:00,809
Know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna whup your ass.

640
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:02,810
And then I'm gonna
whup your ass.

641
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:05,229
Kenny, we'd love to see that.
We would.

642
00:49:05,355 --> 00:49:07,148
- Come on, Kenny!
- Come on!

643
00:49:07,273 --> 00:49:08,357
- Come on!
- Do it!

644
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,942
I'll shoot you and say
you fell in the kitchen.

645
00:49:10,068 --> 00:49:11,736
- Come on!
- You better chill out.

646
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:15,196
- Kenny, calm down, Kenny!
- What...

647
00:49:25,748 --> 00:49:27,124
Twisting Tiger.

648
00:49:30,502 --> 00:49:31,836
Where did you learn that?

649
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:33,671
Master Ching taught me.

650
00:49:34,214 --> 00:49:35,131
Master Ching from Beijing?

651
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:37,258
No... Freddy Ching's in Crenshaw.

652
00:49:38,134 --> 00:49:40,260
Oh. They're brothers.

653
00:49:40,386 --> 00:49:42,638
Oh, all right, all right.

654
00:49:43,055 --> 00:49:45,015
Why are you hanging out with 7-11?

655
00:49:45,224 --> 00:49:46,391
7-11?

656
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,310
Because his mouth never closes.

657
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:55,691
Hey! I heard that.
I heard that.

658
00:49:55,817 --> 00:49:57,860
Don't be talkin' about me, man.

659
00:49:57,985 --> 00:50:00,737
- You're here about some funny money?
- How you know?

660
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:03,156
- C-notes, right?
- Yeah.

661
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:05,324
Any of 'em came through here?

662
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:08,827
One of my regulars
came in a few days ago...

663
00:50:08,953 --> 00:50:11,788
dropped about 50 large
on the tables in there.

664
00:50:11,914 --> 00:50:14,666
I was about to go down there
with my boys and tune his ass up...

665
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,835
but he comes in the next day
with the whole thing.

666
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,754
Brand-new one hundred dollar
bills, sequential.

667
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,715
I figure they're fake, 'cause
this guy's got a regular day job.

668
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:25,218
So I test 'em,
and they checked out.

669
00:50:25,343 --> 00:50:27,511
You still have the bills?

670
00:50:27,636 --> 00:50:29,929
Still got my lunch money
from the third grade.

671
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,306
Let me see 'em.

672
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:57,163
Hold it.
What are you doin'?

673
00:51:03,502 --> 00:51:04,419
It's fake.

674
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:07,504
He got you.
Who you say gave that to you?

675
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,590
Cat named Zing.
Work down at Reign Plaza.

676
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:13,343
You better hope
you find him before I do.

677
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:40,450
Excuse me. L.A.P.D.

678
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:42,744
We're lookin' for
a guy named Zing.

679
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:47,415
Come here!
Come back here!

680
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:50,334
Hey! Hey!
You little rascal!

681
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:54,213
Get back here!
Get back here right now!

682
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:07,391
The great Chief Inspector Lee.

683
00:52:09,936 --> 00:52:12,855
I'll be remembered for
getting rid of you.

684
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:15,440
Know what? I don't even know
why the hell I'm here.

685
00:52:15,607 --> 00:52:17,733
I ain't even Chinese.

686
00:52:17,859 --> 00:52:19,735
All right, I'm sorry.

687
00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:24,781
I think there's someone who
would like to talk to them first.

688
00:52:34,249 --> 00:52:36,459
What'd you do that for?
That was unnecessary!

689
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:44,800
You knocked out my filling, girl.
That's gonna cost you.

690
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:51,805
I ain't never hit a woman in my life,
but your ass is pushin' it!

691
00:52:55,226 --> 00:52:57,978
Okay, all right.
I'll go.

692
00:53:01,398 --> 00:53:03,274
Better watch your back.

693
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,267
What happened?

694
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:45,812
That lady Isabella knock you out.
She played you.

695
00:53:45,938 --> 00:53:47,314
- No.
- Yes, she did.

696
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:49,315
- She save our life.
- What?

697
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:51,818
- Hu Li could have killed us.
- Are you crazy, man?

698
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:54,362
Look at us.
We good as dead!

699
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:57,489
- Stop your whining!
- What you gonna do if I don't stop?

700
00:53:57,615 --> 00:53:59,867
I will slap the hell
outta you right now, Lee.

701
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:04,287
- I'll bitch-slap you back to Africa!
- You will?

702
00:54:04,412 --> 00:54:07,331
Let me see that.
I wanna see you do that!

703
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:10,126
You don't know
who you're messin' with, man!

704
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:12,127
You don't know
who you're messin' with, do you?

705
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:15,213
- I'll bite your damn nose off.
- You bite... Come on!

706
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:28,183
I don't trust her.

707
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:30,268
It's a mistake having her here.

708
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:33,396
Our orders are to leave her alone.

709
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,195
I want to slice those pretty lips
right off her face

710
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:46,366
and bury her in the desert
with those two cops.

711
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,953
Some apple?

712
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,250
I'd put that knife away, bitch,
before you have an accident.

713
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:08,427
Ain't no use, man.

714
00:55:08,553 --> 00:55:11,055
Just tell me how the Triads
are gonna kill us.

715
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,015
They will torture us
for three days.

716
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:18,394
- I can handle that.
- Then they'll cut off our egg rolls.

717
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,730
Cut off our egg rolls?
Hell, no!

718
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:24,233
Let's get the hell outta here!
Come on, don't give up!

719
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:34,492
- I don't wanna die!
- Be quiet.

720
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,662
- Okay, give me your left leg.
- What for?

721
00:55:38,788 --> 00:55:39,830
Left leg!

722
00:55:39,956 --> 00:55:41,332
Like this.

723
00:55:43,751 --> 00:55:45,627
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

724
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:58,972
That's it.
Bite that thing.

725
00:55:59,098 --> 00:56:01,099
Bite it like a little monkey!

726
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:03,225
Bite it! There you go.

727
00:56:03,351 --> 00:56:05,686
Yank it!
Use them tiger teeth!

728
00:56:05,812 --> 00:56:08,147
Yeah! Grab it!
Pull on it!

729
00:56:08,272 --> 00:56:10,607
You almost got it.
That's it.

730
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:12,609
Oh, shit!

731
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:15,153
- What the hell?
- Wow!

732
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:17,614
Lee, untie me.
Hurry up, man!

733
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:21,492
All these statues full of money.

734
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,376
Hello, Benjamin!

735
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,965
- What are you doing?
- I'm takin' this for evidence.

736
00:56:42,594 --> 00:56:43,803
You feel that?

737
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:46,181
Yeah. We slowin' down, man.

738
00:57:01,194 --> 00:57:03,571
- What happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

739
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:07,992
Come on, Lee!

740
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:14,164
Carter, go up.

741
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:46,817
- What happened?
- You left me.

742
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:49,236
I didn't leave you.
I was waitin' up there for you.

743
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,377
Whoa, man!
I ain't goin' in there!

744
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:08,378
- Come on!
- There's rats in there!

745
00:58:08,504 --> 00:58:10,589
- There's no rats!
- Look at that rat!

746
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:33,776
Las Vegas?

747
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,656
What the hell we doin' in Vegas?

748
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,199
Look.
Red Dragon.

749
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:43,994
That's the name
of Ricky Tan's boat.

750
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,079
Lee.

751
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:52,042
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

752
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:53,627
- Sorry.
- Damn!

753
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:56,296
One at a time.
What the hell is wrong with you?

754
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:02,552
- Wait a second, man.
- What?

755
00:59:02,677 --> 00:59:04,553
- We can't go in there like this.
- Why?

756
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:06,889
- We got to look fly.
- What you mean, "fly"?

757
00:59:07,014 --> 00:59:08,890
We got to mack out.
We can't go in like this.

758
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:10,392
What does it mean, "mack out"?

759
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:12,895
Follow me, my Asian brother.
I'll show you.

760
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,980
Come on.

761
00:59:22,695 --> 00:59:24,321
That's where we're going.

762
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:26,615
When we get in there,
you stay a couple steps behind me.

763
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,784
You smell a little funky.
I think you stepped in rat shit.

764
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,205
It was a cowboy hat,
and now it's a pith helmet.

765
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,582
Hold on.
Talk to you in a bit.

766
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,208
Hi.
Can I help you?

767
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:41,128
Yeah, I'm gonna need
black, 42 long...

768
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:43,546
and nothing touches this body
but pure silk.

769
00:59:43,672 --> 00:59:46,257
And get my partner something
from the kids' department.

770
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:48,301
Would your partner like to be
wrapped in silk as well?

771
00:59:48,426 --> 00:59:51,804
Some people think it's tacky,
but I enjoy it when couples dress alike.

772
00:59:51,929 --> 00:59:54,139
No, this ain't no
couple thing, man.

773
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:56,850
We're police officers on
a dangerous case, and we need clothes.

774
00:59:56,975 --> 00:59:58,851
Yes.
There are a lot of men chasing us.

775
00:59:58,977 --> 01:00:01,979
As well they should be.
You have nothing to worry about, okay?

776
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:04,023
Because I'm gonna turn you two
into the belle of the ball.

777
01:00:04,149 --> 01:00:06,984
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Let's start with you.

778
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:10,737
You've got a mochaccino face, wonderful
skin, and the big, broad shoulders.

779
01:00:10,863 --> 01:00:13,573
Let's put a dead animal
on you. Croc skin.

780
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:15,575
Butter cream, croc skin,
butter cream...

781
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,618
What size is the waist?
Let's go in.

782
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:19,996
Hey!
Watch it, sweetness!

783
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:22,539
- He's got some fire to him.
- Honey cups!

784
01:00:22,665 --> 01:00:24,791
- I like that.
- Go get the clothes! Hurry up!

785
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:28,712
I'll pull some items.
Oh, Jesus. Li'l Kim, I'll be back.

786
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:32,465
- You see that?
- He likes you.

787
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,008
I'm not shopping
with you no more.

788
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,811
- Act like you're rich.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

789
01:00:46,937 --> 01:00:48,980
Steven Reign...

790
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:53,442
owner and founder
of the Red Dragon Casino.

791
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,152
Thank you.

792
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,657
Thank you.
Good evening.

793
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:05,328
A thousand years ago, a small,
wealthy village in China...

794
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,914
hired a young dragon
to guard their treasures in a cave.

795
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,834
The people of the village
started sneaking him extra food...

796
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:14,961
hoping to make him stronger.

797
01:01:15,128 --> 01:01:17,463
The dragon grew so big
he got stuck...

798
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,841
and the treasure
was trapped behind him...

799
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:22,842
for all eternity.

800
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:27,388
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have found that lost treasure.

801
01:01:27,556 --> 01:01:32,810
It is here, inside
the greatest casino in the world!

802
01:01:32,977 --> 01:01:35,020
Welcome to the Red Dragon...

803
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:37,440
where everybody is a winner!

804
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,668
Black, 29.

805
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:09,385
Look at this place, Lee.
It's the biggest front in the world.

806
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:11,095
Yeah, right...

807
01:02:12,971 --> 01:02:15,181
- Would you like a drink?
- Cigarettes?

808
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:21,270
- Put your arms around me.
- What?

809
01:02:21,395 --> 01:02:23,438
Hold me close.
There are cameras everywhere.

810
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:27,901
- What's going on?
- I think I may be in trouble, Lee.

811
01:02:28,068 --> 01:02:30,028
I really need your help.

812
01:02:30,153 --> 01:02:33,155
Last time you needed my help,
I woke up in a truck.

813
01:02:33,323 --> 01:02:37,076
I'm undercover, Lee. I had no choice.
You have to trust me.

814
01:02:37,243 --> 01:02:40,412
Look over my right shoulder.
That's the soft count room.

815
01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:42,956
We think the plates are in there.

816
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:46,083
- I need you to go and get them.
- Why don't you go get them?

817
01:02:46,209 --> 01:02:50,045
Because if I'm wrong, then my entire
cover is blown. You understand?

818
01:02:52,006 --> 01:02:54,299
How do I know I can trust you?

819
01:02:54,425 --> 01:02:55,884
Dip me.

820
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,805
I'm asking for real now.

821
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:03,098
Will you help the Secret Service?

822
01:03:14,109 --> 01:03:17,862
What are you doing?
Thank you, man. Take this.

823
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,198
- Dancing.
- Dancing?

824
01:03:21,324 --> 01:03:23,617
Man, I'm up here working,
putting my life on the line...

825
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:26,702
and you're up here,
dancing with some bimbo?

826
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:29,372
- Does she have a friend?
- That was Isabella.

827
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,082
She says the plates are
in the soft count room.

828
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,960
I know you didn't just say Isabella.
Are you crazy, man?

829
01:03:35,086 --> 01:03:38,005
- That girl is setting you up again.
- No. I'm gonna find out.

830
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,048
No, wait, man.

831
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,802
There's security all over. If you're
gonna do this, you need a distraction.

832
01:03:44,928 --> 01:03:48,347
So keep your eye on me, and you'll
know when to make your move.

833
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:49,557
- Good.
- Cool.

834
01:03:57,272 --> 01:04:00,316
- Come on, big eight!
- Come on, Tex!

835
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,820
Hey, hey, hey!
Good roll, man!

836
01:04:04,946 --> 01:04:08,574
This table's hot! I want some
of this money. Get me in this game.

837
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:16,581
Let me have a Diet Pepsi
and some hot wings.

838
01:04:16,706 --> 01:04:19,416
- 100,000. Give him the chips.
- Let's play! I'm gonna get some!

839
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:22,127
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

840
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:29,508
No, sir. I did not.
I just assumed that...

841
01:04:33,012 --> 01:04:36,264
- Is that it?
- No, I didn't think that at all, sir.

842
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,308
- You a racist?
- No, I'm not, sir.

843
01:04:42,896 --> 01:04:45,148
- How did that happen?
- It just happened. I'm sorry.

844
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:49,485
This is crazy. You think my people
suffered 362 years of slavery...

845
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:54,656
Do I look like Chicken George to you?

846
01:04:54,782 --> 01:04:56,742
- You do not.
- What the hell is that?

847
01:04:56,867 --> 01:05:00,370
- I think you should calm down.
- I think you should go count something.

848
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:05,499
Hurry up. I just want to be treated
fairly. Is that too much to ask?

849
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:08,877
- No.
- Is that too much to ask?

850
01:05:09,003 --> 01:05:10,546
I got a problem on table nine.

851
01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:22,681
Why are no black people performing
in this hotel? We ain't good enough?

852
01:05:22,807 --> 01:05:24,850
We got Lionel Richie
performing here tonight.

853
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:27,143
Lionel Richie ain't been black
since the Commodores, man.

854
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:29,938
What about Peaches and Herb?
Gladys Knight and the Pips?

855
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:33,732
Ike and Tina? They can get
back together. This is crazy.

856
01:05:33,858 --> 01:05:36,610
Sir, why don't you calm down,
win some money and have some fun?

857
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:39,571
I ain't calmin' down no more!
I'm sick of you tryin' to calm me down.

858
01:05:39,697 --> 01:05:42,491
We got a problem.
Go.

859
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,090
I have a dream...

860
01:06:01,216 --> 01:06:04,260
that white people
and black people...

861
01:06:04,385 --> 01:06:07,429
and even Chinese people
can gamble together...

862
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:09,431
without gettin' different chips!

863
01:06:09,556 --> 01:06:11,349
Hallelujah!

864
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:19,398
Hold it. In the spirit of brotherhood,
let's just play craps, man.

865
01:06:19,524 --> 01:06:21,400
Come on. Let's go.
Come on!

866
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:44,212
Oh, shit.

867
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,336
Get him! Stop!

868
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,997
Inspector Lee, this is a
ying-tao grenade.

869
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:12,874
Please follow me.

870
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,835
Or I'll push this detonator,

871
01:08:16,169 --> 01:08:18,879
and blow your 32 teeth
into your brain.

872
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:23,133
Winner.

873
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:26,303
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

874
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:29,514
I feel good.
Who put their hand on my butt?

875
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:31,807
Do it again. Give me that.
How much I win?

876
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:33,809
200,000, sir.

877
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,688
All right.

878
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:41,274
This seven I'm about to roll...

879
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,569
is for the 27 years Mandela spent in
that prison and couldn't get justice...

880
01:08:44,694 --> 01:08:45,945
and took all that crap.

881
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:50,490
That's why I ain't gonna crap out.
This one is for Mandela!

882
01:08:52,743 --> 01:08:53,952
A winner. Seven.

883
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:14,554
Out.

884
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:22,477
Imagine a business
where people hand you money...

885
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:27,065
and you hand them back
absolutely nothing.

886
01:09:28,942 --> 01:09:32,778
Now, that's
the real American dream.

887
01:09:32,904 --> 01:09:34,947
Thanks to a few pieces of metal...

888
01:09:35,072 --> 01:09:39,117
and a most beautiful
U.S. Customs agent...

889
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:41,536
I'm back in business.

890
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,418
Look at you, Lee.

891
01:09:49,543 --> 01:09:51,419
You look ridiculous.

892
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:57,509
You know it didn't have
to be like this.

893
01:09:57,634 --> 01:09:59,886
It's too bad.

894
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:02,805
Like father, like son.

895
01:10:04,599 --> 01:10:06,475
He's headed for the penthouse.

896
01:10:09,478 --> 01:10:11,604
Look at this old fool.

897
01:10:13,565 --> 01:10:16,275
What does he think he's doing?

898
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:19,278
I tell you, it's almost impossible
to find a partner...

899
01:10:19,403 --> 01:10:22,155
that is trustworthy and loyal.

900
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:25,575
Don't you agree, Lee?

901
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:28,995
Everything stays on the table.
Don't nobody touch it. You understand?

902
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:34,291
Winner, four high.

903
01:10:41,256 --> 01:10:43,216
- Yes!
- Come on, sir.

904
01:10:44,717 --> 01:10:48,887
Tell them to get rid of Lee's friend.

905
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,473
- Cash me out.
- Sir, get off the table.

906
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,183
Thank you very much.

907
01:10:56,478 --> 01:11:00,356
The trouble
with partners is, they die.

908
01:11:01,316 --> 01:11:02,775
As will you.

909
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:10,907
Have fun.

910
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:23,502
After I'm through with you you'll be
begging me to push this button.

911
01:11:27,255 --> 01:11:31,008
Don't move! U.S. Secret Service!
You're under arrest.

912
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:50,359
These gentlemen will escort you
to the cashier.

913
01:11:50,484 --> 01:11:53,820
Good, 'cause I don't want to get jumped
by these rich white folks. Let's go.

914
01:12:16,924 --> 01:12:20,093
I appreciate this, fellas.
You never can be too safe.

915
01:12:31,062 --> 01:12:32,229
What the...

916
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:35,691
I'm sorry, man.
Did that hurt?

917
01:12:35,816 --> 01:12:37,067
Hey, you! Hold it!

918
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,236
You okay?

919
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:01,464
Black man get on a roll,
y'all start trippin'.

920
01:13:01,589 --> 01:13:03,507
- Y'all get back!
- Calm down!

921
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:08,345
Get back! Get back!
Get back!

922
01:13:12,182 --> 01:13:16,185
- Hey, get down.
- Drop the stick.

923
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:25,401
Where you been, Lee?
I been on a roll, man!

924
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:40,082
What happened to you, man?

925
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,750
What's that light in your mouth?

926
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,669
Oh, man, this can't be good.

927
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:01,976
Move!
Would you get out of my way?

928
01:14:15,113 --> 01:14:16,322
What's wrong with you?

929
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,157
What happened to you, man?

930
01:14:42,762 --> 01:14:44,847
Why the hell you didn't
tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?

931
01:14:44,973 --> 01:14:46,307
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

932
01:14:46,432 --> 01:14:49,184
- I said "Mmm!"
- What the hell is "Mmm"?

933
01:14:52,604 --> 01:14:56,148
Ricky Tan's still alive.
We have to get to the penthouse.

934
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:57,900
Ricky Tan dead.

935
01:14:58,026 --> 01:14:59,902
What you talking about?

936
01:15:06,825 --> 01:15:09,368
Lee. Go after Ricky, man.
I got this.

937
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:12,371
- Carter...
- Just go, man. I got this.

938
01:15:16,876 --> 01:15:19,294
I'm not gonna hold back on you
this time just because you're a woman.

939
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:23,089
I'm gonna pretend you're a man.

940
01:15:23,215 --> 01:15:25,967
A very beautiful man
with a perfect body...

941
01:15:26,092 --> 01:15:28,052
who I'd like to take
to the movies.

942
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:39,729
You don't know nothing about this,
do you? Egyptian style, girl.

943
01:15:39,855 --> 01:15:43,316
You want some of this?
Come on.

944
01:15:43,441 --> 01:15:44,900
Bring it on!

945
01:15:56,578 --> 01:15:58,246
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

946
01:15:58,371 --> 01:15:59,330
You need help.

947
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,334
I didn't know
which side you were on.

948
01:16:05,836 --> 01:16:07,629
Well, now you know.

949
01:16:07,754 --> 01:16:08,963
What's wrong with you, woman?

950
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,637
Mmm, you smell good.

951
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:16,857
Thank you, Benjamin.
Thank you.

952
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:25,072
We could have been a good couple.
We could have had something special.

953
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,075
But you one crazy-ass bitch!

954
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,963
Americans love to gamble,
don't they, Mr. Reign?

955
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:44,214
I never gamble.

956
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,883
Oh, I'm cutting our deal short.

957
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,222
And my plates?

958
01:17:52,347 --> 01:17:55,182
The plates stay with me. I'm sure
you won't have a problem with that.

959
01:17:57,769 --> 01:17:59,854
I enjoyed that little
story you told...

960
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:02,439
about the dragon
and the treasure.

961
01:18:02,565 --> 01:18:05,192
My mother used to tell it
to me all the time.

962
01:18:06,902 --> 01:18:09,320
Do you know the moral
of that story?

963
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:11,781
Greed will imprison us all.

964
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:18,620
I hate that fortune-cookie shit.

965
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:34,592
Just like your father.

966
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:39,013
I really did try
to help him, you know.

967
01:18:39,139 --> 01:18:41,057
To share with him.

968
01:18:41,182 --> 01:18:43,684
To make your life better.

969
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,978
But he was too weak.

970
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:49,898
- Too afraid of change.
- Give me the plates.

971
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:53,527
- It's over.
- I don't think it's over.

972
01:18:53,652 --> 01:18:57,447
There are casinos
all over this country.

973
01:18:57,572 --> 01:19:00,491
I can make you
a very rich man, Lee.

974
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:03,034
Don't make the same mistake
your father did.

975
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,538
If you reach for that gun,
I'll kill you.

976
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:10,916
Don't you remember?
I'm already dead.

977
01:19:16,672 --> 01:19:18,256
Hey, Ricky.
How you doin'?

978
01:19:18,382 --> 01:19:20,634
Lee, I see you got
everything under control.

979
01:19:20,759 --> 01:19:23,761
I'm gonna go downstairs and...
Goddamn!

980
01:19:23,887 --> 01:19:27,515
- What happened to Reign?
- Shall I tell you how your father died?

981
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,392
Hey, hey.
Wait one second, Lee.

982
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:32,436
It ain't worth it, man.
He tryin' to trick you.

983
01:19:32,561 --> 01:19:35,188
- Don't go too far, now.
- He never begged for his life...

984
01:19:35,314 --> 01:19:37,566
- or tried to make a deal.
- Put the gun down.

985
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:41,235
All he asked me, just seconds
before I pulled the trigger...

986
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:44,155
was that I promise
not to kill you.

987
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,449
Oh, he was so pathetic.

988
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:51,203
Oh, hell, no. He went too far.
Shoot his ass right now, Lee!

989
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:52,537
What are you gonna do?

990
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:55,248
All you got to do is pull
that trigger back and bam!

991
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:58,375
Are you going to spend the rest
of your life hiding like your father?

992
01:19:58,501 --> 01:20:01,086
Man, don't let him talk about
your daddy like that. Shoot him, Lee.

993
01:20:01,212 --> 01:20:03,547
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, hell, you can, Lee.

994
01:20:03,672 --> 01:20:06,299
- Ain't nobody up here but us.
- Just as I thought.

995
01:20:06,425 --> 01:20:08,051
He tryin' to punk you.
Shoot him!

996
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:11,178
If you ain't gonna shoot him,
kung fu his ass or something.

997
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:36,033
Damn!
Good kick, Lee.

998
01:20:36,201 --> 01:20:38,119
It was an accident.

999
01:20:38,286 --> 01:20:41,538
That's okay. We'll just say
he tried to catch a cab.

1000
01:20:45,209 --> 01:20:47,294
What's that in your...
Oh, hell, no.

1001
01:20:47,461 --> 01:20:49,879
Lady, you listen
to me right now.

1002
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:52,966
- Put that bomb down and turn it off!
- Carter, we have to jump!

1003
01:20:53,091 --> 01:20:54,884
You crazy. I ain't jumpin'.

1004
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,970
- Use your jacket!
- Hey, turn that bomb off!

1005
01:20:58,805 --> 01:21:01,098
Crazy-ass...

1006
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:16,695
That wasn't so bad.

1007
01:21:54,437 --> 01:21:57,523
I cannot believe I flew
10,000 miles for this shit.

1008
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:11,243
Detective Lee,
I hate to admit it...

1009
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:14,872
but the United States Secret Service
is indebted to you.

1010
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:17,123
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1011
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:19,167
I'll see you on board.

1012
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:23,880
I want to thank you too.

1013
01:22:31,762 --> 01:22:34,597
It was nice working with you.

1014
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:47,609
I saw that.

1015
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:50,821
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

1016
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:55,241
You played it cool, too, walking away
and not looking back. I like that.

1017
01:22:55,366 --> 01:22:57,200
Yeah.
I'm a player.

1018
01:22:59,036 --> 01:23:01,705
- Where is she headed?
- She's going to New York.

1019
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:07,877
- Is that your gate down there?
- Yep.

1020
01:23:08,003 --> 01:23:10,463
Well, I'm this way.

1021
01:23:10,588 --> 01:23:12,923
- Guess that means good-bye.
- I guess so.

1022
01:23:14,383 --> 01:23:16,259
Thank you, Carter.

1023
01:23:16,385 --> 01:23:18,428
Take good care
of yourself, Lee.

1024
01:23:22,724 --> 01:23:25,226
- Oh, Carter.
- Yeah, Lee?

1025
01:23:25,351 --> 01:23:27,519
What's up?

1026
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,772
There is something
I want you to have.

1027
01:23:33,233 --> 01:23:35,818
No. This is your daddy's badge.
I can't take that, man. No way.

1028
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:38,529
It's okay. No.
Finally, I can let it go.

1029
01:23:40,573 --> 01:23:42,449
Thank you, man.
Hey.

1030
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:45,786
You know what?
I got something for you too.

1031
01:23:49,915 --> 01:23:52,667
I got it at the tables this morning
at Caesar's. I'm still hot.

1032
01:23:52,793 --> 01:23:56,254
- I can't take this.
- Don't worry. I got a lot more.

1033
01:23:56,379 --> 01:23:59,423
- Go ahead. Enjoy yourself.
- No, Carter. I can't have this.

1034
01:23:59,549 --> 01:24:01,967
Would you stop acting like a cop
for one second and live it up?

1035
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:04,510
There got to be something
you want. Come on.

1036
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:06,637
Think about it.

1037
01:24:06,763 --> 01:24:11,558
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 44 to La Guardia.

1038
01:24:11,684 --> 01:24:15,645
I always wanted to go to Madison
Square Garden, see the Knicks play.

1039
01:24:15,771 --> 01:24:17,939
- New York City?
- First class.

1040
01:24:18,065 --> 01:24:20,442
- The Plaza Hotel?
- Maybe a little mu shu?

1041
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:23,194
- Amen to that, brother.
- So, what do you say?

1042
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,114
You know what, man?
I can use another vacation.

1043
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:42,211
- Action!
- Let's go!

1044
01:25:08,985 --> 01:25:11,028
- You all right?
- Is he okay?

1045
01:25:11,154 --> 01:25:14,698
- Jackie, you okay?
- Jackie always okay.

1046
01:25:14,824 --> 01:25:18,160
- Is this the kosher meal?
- Yes, sir. That's our kosher meal.

1047
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:20,662
- What's the name of it?
- Gefilte.

1048
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,414
- Gefilte fish.
- "Filk" fish.

1049
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:26,292
Lox and bagels.
It's my favorite.

1050
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:28,627
- What's the name of this stuff?
- Gefilte fish.

1051
01:25:30,337 --> 01:25:32,505
"Gefilke" fish...
What's the name of this fish?

1052
01:25:35,676 --> 01:25:38,094
You know what this is?
What is it?

1053
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:40,554
- Gefilte fish.
- It's "filte" fish.

1054
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,473
"Filte" fish. You want some
of my "filte" fish?

1055
01:25:42,598 --> 01:25:45,350
You want any of this...
What's the name of the fish?

1056
01:25:48,896 --> 01:25:50,439
Gefilte fish!
All right. Okay.

1057
01:25:50,564 --> 01:25:53,107
- Gefilte fish. I love this stuff.
- I really don't.

1058
01:25:53,233 --> 01:25:55,526
You have black people
all over the world eatin' this.

1059
01:25:55,652 --> 01:25:59,363
Who eats lox and bagels?
I'll have some "gilte" fish.

1060
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,711
Lady!
Jackie, kick it.

1061
01:26:15,836 --> 01:26:18,171
Okay.
Chris Tucker!

1062
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:22,050
- Jackie, kick it.
- Jackie again?

1063
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:24,552
We'd love to see that.
Wouldn't we love to see that, Jackie?

1064
01:26:24,677 --> 01:26:27,304
Jackie, we'd like to see that.

1065
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:29,515
Now, Jackie,
wouldn't we love to see that?

1066
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:32,976
- His name is Lee, goddamn it.
- Lee, we would love to see that.

1067
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:34,811
We would love to see that,
wouldn't we, Lee?

1068
01:26:34,937 --> 01:26:38,773
- There's gotta be something you want.
- I always want to go to Sw...

1069
01:26:38,898 --> 01:26:41,775
I always want to go to Scra...

1070
01:26:41,901 --> 01:26:45,112
I always dreamed to
"Square Marden."

1071
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:47,447
I always wanted to...

1072
01:26:49,908 --> 01:26:52,243
Now I'm gone.
Now I'm nervous.

1073
01:26:52,369 --> 01:26:55,913
Every "garden," I'm nervous.
Madison Square Garden.

1074
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:58,249
I always wanted to go
to this Madison...

1075
01:27:00,584 --> 01:27:02,961
- There are a lot of men chasing us.
- As well there should be.

1076
01:27:03,087 --> 01:27:05,172
'Cause you're a very good-looking man.
If I didn't have a girlfriend...

1077
01:27:05,297 --> 01:27:07,173
I'd take a run at you,
put you in a bubble bath...

1078
01:27:07,299 --> 01:27:10,009
and put some water wings on you
and spank your little bottom.

1079
01:27:10,134 --> 01:27:13,345
But listen.
Here's what we do, guys. Easy, easy.

1080
01:27:13,471 --> 01:27:16,473
Look, you're giggling at me.
I'll take you home and just punish you.

1081
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:18,684
I need both of you.

1082
01:27:18,809 --> 01:27:22,645
You sly devil, you.
She kissed you, didn't she?

1083
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:24,814
- Yeah.
- I like that.

1084
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,732
Oh. Hold on.

1085
01:27:26,858 --> 01:27:30,736
- Who's calling?
- Hello?

1086
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:34,030
Hello?
I'm filming, man.

1087
01:27:34,156 --> 01:27:36,616
Call me back at 7:00.
I'm filming.

1088
01:27:36,741 --> 01:27:39,493
I'm looking Jackie Chan
dead in his eye. Call me back.

1089
01:27:39,619 --> 01:27:42,204
- Call me back.
- Are you a professional? We are filming.

1090
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:45,916
- You turn on your phone?
- No, you can't speak to Jackie Chan.

1091
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,042
No! They want to
speak to you, Jackie.

1092
01:27:48,168 --> 01:27:50,044
- Hello?
- I'm sorry about this.

1093
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:52,839
We are filming right now!

1094
01:27:52,964 --> 01:27:56,550
You're sorry?
You wasted all our film!

1095
01:27:56,676 --> 01:27:58,844
Call me back later.
7:00.

1096
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,769
Damn! He ain't
gonna be in Rush Hour 3.
