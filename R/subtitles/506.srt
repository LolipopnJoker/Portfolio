1
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,535
Marcus.

2
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,417
How are you?

3
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,879
Ask me in an hour.

4
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,968
I thought I'd try...

5
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,095
...one last time.

6
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,181
You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

7
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,145
By signing this consent form...

8
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:30,315
...you'd be donating your body
to a noble cause.

9
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,109
You'd...

10
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:38,574
...have a second chance,
through my research, to live again.

11
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,993
You know what l did.

12
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,663
My brother and two cops are dead
because of me.

13
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,082
I'm not looking for a second chance.

14
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,757
But l'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

15
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,096
Do you think
I'm gonna cure your cancer, Serena?

16
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,893
I'm not worried about myself.

17
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,813
I'm worried about the future
of the human race.

18
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,609
I'll sell it to you.

19
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,819
For what?

20
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,946
A kiss.

21
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,246
Mm.

22
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,003
Oh...

23
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,840
So that's what death tastes like.

24
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,903
You're doing something very noble.

25
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,655
No, I'm guilty.

26
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,824
Just cut me up
until there's nothing left.

27
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:10,666
PRlEST: Yea, though l walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

28
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,545
...l will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

29
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,007
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

30
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,858
Do you have any last words?

31
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,411
MAN
Vanguard, this is Blackjack 6.

32
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,163
Missile inbound to Skynet target.

33
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,500
TTO 11 seconds. Danger close.

34
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,578
Move! Move!
Let's go, let's go! Move it!

35
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,467
MAN 2
Connor is on the ground.

36
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,514
This mission is a quick in-and-out.

37
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,142
Command deems the information
on those computers...

38
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,102
...to be of the highest priority.

39
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,137
BARBAROSA
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.

40
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,388
They're gone.

41
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,806
DAVID
It's way too quiet.

42
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,933
BARBAROSA
It's almost like they're waiting for us.

43
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,943
SOLDlER:
It's down, it's down.

44
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,093
DAVID
What the hell's that smell, man?

45
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,428
Ugh.

46
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,722
JOHN
You seeing this?

47
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,957
Olsen. Objective located.

48
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,834
There's something else
you have to see.

49
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,021
Hard wall.
Get what we came for, Barbarosa.

50
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,481
The clock's ticking.

51
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,693
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.

52
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,861
Why didn't we know about this?

53
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,990
Sir, l think this is
what Command's looking for.

54
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,825
I'm in their source code.

55
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,244
These people are being taken
to San Francisco.

56
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,038
Some sort of R and D project
for a new Terminator.

57
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,082
Send it to Command.

58
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,584
It's uploading. l need two minutes.

59
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,003
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Go back.

60
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,713
Stop.

61
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,720
T-800.
A new Terminator.

62
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,057
It's like you said it would be.

63
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,893
- lt's worse.
Get your nose out of that.

64
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,688
None of your business.
You're not leading this mission.

65
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,858
Let's cut these sorry bastards loose.
Come on. Let's go.

66
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,193
- Jericho, come in.
Watch that.

67
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,862
Come in, Jericho.

68
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,573
Connor, get your ass topside.
Remind those men...

69
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,035
...they need to answer me on the radio,
even if they're dead.

70
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,244
Connor!

71
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,050
OLSEN
Connor, get those men to respond.

72
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,094
Olsen, something's wrong up here.

73
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,649
OLSEN
Topside, come in.

74
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,905
Outbound enemy aircraft.
I'm in pursuit.

75
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,951
There's human prisoners
aboard that thing. Get after it!

76
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,011
OLSEN
Data transfer complete.

77
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,889
Connor, we're joining you topsi-

78
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,474
Olsen.

79
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,868
MAN Bravo 10,
Bravo 10, do you copy? Over.

80
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,793
Eagle 1 to Bravo 10.
Bravo 10, do you copy? Over.

81
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,216
Bravo 10, Bravo 10,
do you copy? Over?

82
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,386
Here.

83
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,639
MAN
Bravo 10, identify. Over.

84
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,808
Connor.

85
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,559
MAN
We'll send units to the extraction point.

86
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,978
How many survivors are on-site? Over.

87
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,730
One.

88
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,399
MAN
Copy.

89
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,967
PlLOT:
Return to base, sir?

90
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,928
- RTB?
- Negative.

91
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,723
- Take me to Command.
- Sir?

92
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,184
Command.

93
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,812
Roger. Rerouting.

94
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,290
PlLOT:
Request has been denied.

95
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,752
Command doesn't wanna give up
their position. Radio comms only.

96
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,172
- Are they down there?
- Request has been denied, sir.

97
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,342
Need-to-know only.
That's straight from the top.

98
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,846
You open up that ramp...

99
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:37,894
...and you tell them l need divers for
a lock-in! Now!

100
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,023
PlLOT:
This is crazy.

101
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,386
John Connor.

102
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,972
Prophesized leader
of the Resistance.

103
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,141
Soldier, you put every man and woman
in this sub in jeopardy...

104
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,602
...with your little frogman stunt.

105
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,771
Let's get one thing straight.

106
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,359
I don't believe in prophecy.

107
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:32,323
Not when one can rewrite
the future in a heartbeat.

108
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,075
Are we on the same page?

109
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,624
Yeah, we're on the same page.

110
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,172
Good. Good.

111
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,509
So, soldier...

112
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,678
...what the hell are you doing here?

113
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,514
- What did we find down there?
- You'll be briefed...

114
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,142
- ...on a need-to-know basis.
- Well, l need to know.

115
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,353
Because my men died
down in that hole.

116
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,230
What did we find down there?

117
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:10,611
We found a solution, Connor,
that can end this war once and for all.

118
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,243
We know the machines use shortwave
transmitters to communicate.

119
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,706
Intel has located a hidden signal
under the primary channel.

120
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,501
It allows for direct control
of the machines.

121
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,129
Skynet's a machine,
and like all machines...

122
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,631
...it has an off switch.

123
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,592
Does it work?

124
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,346
Will it work? Yes.
Have we field tested it? No.

125
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,224
Give it to me.

126
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,226
I'll do it.

127
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,812
I'll test it.

128
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,777
Connor and his tech-comm unit
have an excellent record.

129
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,487
All right.

130
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,782
All right. Huh.

131
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,286
Take Connor topside.
Prepare for lockout.

132
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,627
Connor, we do this right,
the war is over.

133
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,672
We mount our offensive in four days.

134
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,802
Connor.

135
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,223
These are the codes for the signal.

136
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,559
- Good luck.
- Why four days?

137
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,229
A kill list was intercepted
from Skynet.

138
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,774
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

139
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,401
You're number two on the list.

140
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:39,325
- Well, who's number one?
- An unknown. A civilian. Kyle Reese.

141
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,567
OLSEN
Jericho, come in.

142
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,318
Come in, Jericho.

143
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,825
Barnes.

144
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,497
My brother,
he didn't make it, did he?

145
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,759
This is tape number 28
of Sarah Connor to my son, John.

146
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,011
What's most difficult
is trying to decide...

147
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,680
...what to tell you and what not to.

148
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,724
Should I tell you about your father?

149
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,770
Will it affect your decision to
send him back in time to protect me...

150
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,022
...knowing that he is your father?

151
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,400
And he'll be younger than you.
Only a teenager when you meet him.

152
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,237
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

153
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,074
But if you don't send Kyle,
you can never be...

154
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,826
...and Skynet will win the war.

155
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,123
You want to talk about him?

156
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:58,256
Kyle is out there somewhere alone,
and Skynet is hunting him.

157
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,008
What about the signal?

158
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,803
What do you think?

159
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,981
lf it works, it's incredible.
Yeah.

160
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,483
We have to be careful.
- l agree.

161
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,736
- But we have to try.
Okay.

162
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,782
All right, start with something small
that we're familiar with.

163
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,122
We should capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.

164
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,415
Yeah.

165
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,710
What is it, John?

166
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,258
Kill Kyle Reese, reset the future...

167
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,719
...no John Connor.

168
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,926
Hey!

169
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,221
Come with me if you wanna live.

170
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,454
What is that?

171
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,790
She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.

172
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,127
Where'd you get that jacket?

173
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,879
- The other guy didn't need it.
- Oh?

174
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,715
You see that red?

175
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,718
It stands for blood.
It's a symbol of the Resistance.

176
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:35,055
You're obviously not
a Resistance fighter, so take it off.

177
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,433
Take it off!

178
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,977
You point a gun at someone...

179
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,771
...you'd better be ready
to pull the trigger.

180
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,986
Now, l'm gonna ask you
one more time.

181
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,282
- What the hell was that thing?
- Terminator.

182
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,700
T-600.

183
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,623
What day is it?

184
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,584
What year?

185
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,630
2018.

186
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,967
What happened here?

187
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,555
Judgment Day happened.

188
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,186
I gotta get out of here.

189
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,439
You can't go on foot.
The machines will cut you down.

190
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,399
You need speed.

191
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,776
I need a car.

192
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,904
Well, look, there's some
by Griffith Observatory.

193
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,948
- They don't run though.
- Take me.

194
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,034
Get down!

195
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,941
That was a Hunter-Killer.

196
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,653
Thanks to you, they know we're here.

197
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,824
What's your name, kid?

198
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,368
Kyle Reese.

199
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,623
Come on.

200
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,875
WHIRRING AND SQUEALING]

201
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,421
We burned out his transmitter
so it can't talk to any of its pals.

202
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,840
But he can still receive.

203
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,675
Turn it on.

204
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,137
You got it?

205
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,014
Hold it down, hold it down.

206
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,768
Turn the signal up.

207
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,904
Give me the strap.

208
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,116
- Holy shit.
- Do you believe it?

209
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,203
All right. Strap it tight.
The signal has to be continuous.

210
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,122
If there's any interruption...

211
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,545
JOHN
Okay.

212
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,926
Let's rig up a portable shortwave,
test it on something larger in the field.

213
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,303
All right.

214
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,766
Destroy this thing.

215
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,819
So where are the cars?

216
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,072
You don't wanna go out after dark.

217
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:42,326
Hunter-Killers have infrared,
hunt better at night.

218
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,870
We'll all go tomorrow morning.

219
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,461
What is that?
Two-day-old coyote.

220
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,341
Better than three-day-old coyote.

221
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,519
Hey, hey!

222
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,728
Shhh.

223
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,776
Grab it.
- What?

224
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,487
Grab it.

225
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,580
Magic.

226
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,754
Got it?
Yeah.

227
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,465
Thanks.

228
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,763
Does this radio work?

229
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,849
No.

230
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:50,978
My dad tried to fix it,
but he could never get it to work.

231
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,288
Hold that.

232
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,003
Where is everybody?

233
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,338
They're gone.

234
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,841
So why are you still here?

235
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,927
Because we're the Resistance,
L.A. branch.

236
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,346
Welcome to the headquarters.

237
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,224
Resisting what?

238
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,978
Machines. Skynet.

239
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,898
- Just the two of you?
Yeah.

240
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,068
How come you're not
wearing one of these?

241
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,031
Because I haven't earned mine yet.

242
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,959
I hope he's listening to this.

243
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,297
We've been fighting a long time...

244
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,968
...and we have all lost so very much,
so many loved ones gone.

245
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,012
But you are not alone.

246
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,349
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

247
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,518
We are at the brink.

248
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,230
Do you wanna see a magic trick?
Hold that up.

249
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,694
Press the button.

250
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,619
JOHN Effective range of their
main weapon is less than 100 meters.

251
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,623
They pack a lot of firepower,
but the T-600s are heavy and slow.

252
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,500
They are a primitive design.

253
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,669
- Who is that?
If you can't outrun them...

254
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,129
- l don't know.
- ...then you have one option.

255
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,883
Their motor cortex is partially
exposed at the back of their neck.

256
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:49,137
A knife to this area will disorient
their tracking device, but not for long.

257
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,975
Above all, stay alive.
You have no idea...

258
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:57,604
...how important you are,
and how important you will become.

259
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,108
The machines are advancing
even faster than I told you they would.

260
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,734
I've seen it with my own eyes.

261
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,488
They're inventing new Terminators,
new ways of killing us.

262
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,200
Skynet is planning something big.

263
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,078
But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.

264
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,540
This is John Connor.

265
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,961
If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.

266
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,007
John Connor.

267
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,093
We gotta find this guy.

268
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,030
Ow.

269
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,088
So you get it working?
Almost.

270
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,967
Good. Look,
I figure we head east, right?

271
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,763
We go through the desert, then we can
connect with the Resistance there.

272
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,683
- l'm heading north.
No, no, no.

273
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:20,228
The machines control the whole
northern sector, up to San Francisco.

274
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,689
- That's Skynet Central.
- l have to find someone.

275
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,651
There's a lot you don't understand
about Skynet, okay?

276
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,779
It's just too dangerous for us
to go there.

277
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,990
What about the L.A. branch?

278
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,999
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.

279
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,189
What is that?

280
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,526
Something my brother
used to listen to.

281
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,324
Star, get out.

282
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,204
Don't look at me like that, Star.

283
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,957
Out. Get out!

284
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,212
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?

285
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,466
Oh, l get it.

286
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,472
You wanna know the difference
between us and the machines?

287
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,350
We bury our dead.

288
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,688
But no one is coming to bury you.

289
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,781
WHIRRING]

290
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,658
Aerostat!

291
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,245
- lt's a scout for the Terminators.
- Go, drive!

292
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,298
The Aerostats heard the music!

293
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,636
- Keep it steady!
- l've never driven before.

294
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,433
Hold the wheel!

295
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,649
This thing's pissing me off!

296
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,493

00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:40,994
Hold on!

298
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,889
If the idea is to stay alive,
I'm driving.

299
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,938
We're seeing a lot
of enemy movement in L.A.

300
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,482
Any of our people in the area?

301
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,903
No one on the ground. Two A-10s
in the air. Williams and Mihradi.

302
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,197
Send the birds in.

303
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,658
Guide them to a safe area.

304
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,454

Inbound to grid Lima-Alpha...

...125793. Over.

306
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,209
Copy that.
Roger, Wild Eagle. Solid copy.

307
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,644
Hey, there's someone here.

308
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,940
Get off him, get down!
Get down. Down!

309
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,151
Drop your weapon!
Let me see your hands!

310
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,861
Don't move.
That's it, drop it.

311
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,863
Put it down!
What?

312
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,243
- ls there a problem?
Hey, we saw your Resistance sign.

313
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,162
The old lady put it there, not me.

314
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,917
- What do you want?
- We're looking for fuel.

315
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,294
The dark season's coming.

316
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,630
We only got enough for ourselves.

317
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,759
You point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

318
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,804
VlRGINIA:
Put your guns down, everyone.

319
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,269
Look, we just came
to find the Resistance, that's all.

320
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,896
The Resistance? Ha.

321
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,942
What a joke.
Fighting those machines is impossible.

322
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,944
We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.

323
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,363
They'll come for you eventually.

324
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,156
We help you, maybe they will.

325
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,326
These people aren't going to help you.
Let's go.

326

VlRGINIA:
You're not going anywhere.

327
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,914
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

328
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,134
Bring me a basket.

329
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,388
Here you go.

330
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,060
Come on.
Help yourself. Eat up.

331
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,028
Are you all right, son?

332
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,365
It's our food.

333
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:09,786
Our fuel.
It's not your choice to make!

334
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,071
Are you okay?
- What?

335
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,573
Are you okay?!

336
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,826
Star. Star.
Star! Star!

337
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,704
You! You brought them here!

338
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,541
Hey!

339
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,587
Stop! Stop!
Come on, quick!

340
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:05,175
Hey.
Go! Go! Forget them! Go! Go!

341
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,721
Go!

00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,271
Tunnels! Head for the tunnels!
Truck!

343
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,577
Marcus. Marcus.

344
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,415
We can't just run for it!

345
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,427
Run!

346
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,382
Shoot it!

347
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,096
Go, go, go!

348
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,062
It didn't work!

349
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,898
Shit!

350
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,932
Ha. Hell, yeah!

351
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,771
Oh.

352
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,619
Moto-Terminators!

353
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,257
Shoot that son of a bitch!

354
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,985
Marcus, turn right up here.

355
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,499
Hold on!

356
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,386
Where's the other one?

357
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,112
Get up here!

358
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,823
Ugh. Ah!

359
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,995
Come on.

360
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,830
Star, give me the gun.

361
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,249
I got it.

362
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,836
Yeah!

363
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,138
Hang on!

364
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,523
- Drop the ball!
All right.

365
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,221
Ah!

366
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,357
Star, hold on!
Ah!

367
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,908
Star! Star!
No!

368
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,699
Kyle!
Marcus.

369
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,033
Get back.

370
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,457
Marcus! Marcus!

371
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,627
Ah!

372
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,172
MAN
Got eyes on two targets.

373
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,883
BLAIR
We've got two bogeys at 270 degrees.

374
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,429
They've never come this deep before.
They're looking for something.

375
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,395
BLAIR
H.K. is down.

376
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,412
MAN
We've got an H.K. pushing our six.

377
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,706
BLAIR Abort run.
MAN Breaking off

378
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,506
Evasive maneuvers, now!

379
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,139
Taking fire. l'm hit. Port-side damage.

380
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,022
It's got a lock on you. Break off.

381
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,028
- Eject, Williams, eject!
Punching out.

382
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,633
Prisoner transport
headed northwest...

383
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,302
...bearing 289 toward San Francisco.

384
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,848
Let's test the signal...

385
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,267
...and pray it works.

386
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,599
Ah.

387
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,574
Ugh.

388
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,367
You okay?

389
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,287
Get my knife. lt's in my left boot.

390
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,337
What's your name?

391
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,548
Blair Williams.

392
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,676
What's yours?

393
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,181
Name's Marcus.

394
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,393
You can let me down now, Marcus.

395
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:30,406
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport? Skynet.

396
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,743
- Where the hell are you going?
- After it.

397
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,538
I hate to break it to you,
but if you have friends on that thing...

398
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,667
...they're as good as dead. And same
as you, if you walk in that direction.

399
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,670
Yeah, l've been dead a while
and l'm getting used to it.

400
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,797
Why don't you come with me
to my base?

401
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,091
Connor might know a way.

402
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,847
If you have a problem
with the machines...

403
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,516
...he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.

404
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:03,147
- How far is your base?
- Should be one or two days' hike.

405
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,982
And it's that way.

406
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,342
What are you saying? Speak English!

407
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:39,141
NAlMA: l was telling him it is not true
about the machines killing us.

408
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,186
HIDEKl: They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill everyone.

409
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,689
We're on the way
to the slaughterhouse!

410
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,858
Calm down. You're not helping.

411
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,406
The most important thing we can do
right now is stay alive.

412
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,241
In here and in here.

413
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,786
All right? Just stay alive.

414
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,721
Over there.

415
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,565
Find something we can burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.

416
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,819
Are you hurt?

417
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,281
I'm fine.

418
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,021
What do you got there?

419
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,859
Just some antibiotics.

420
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,113
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

421
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,699
Listen. l don't have much, but
you're welcome to whatever you need.

422
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,701
We've been watching you.

423
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,039
You looking for this?

424
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,127
Come on, guys.
The machines are the enemy.

425
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,796
- We're all on the same side.
No, no.

426
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,382
You see,
I got a couple friends on my side.

427
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,927
Maybe they can carry you home
when l'm done with you.

428
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,431
You might want to chamber a round.

429
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,726
Oh, no.
No.

430
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,525
We done caught us a donkey!
Been waiting for you.

431
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,797
Unh! Richter!

432
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,190
Killing me ain't gonna win this war!

433
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,321
Ah!

434
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,655
Thinking about your past?

435
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,666
You know what l've learned, Marcus?

436
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,588
Is you can focus on what is lost...

437
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:26,845
...or you can fight for what is left.

438
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,651
WHISPERS]
I'm a little cold.

439
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,995
Relax.

440
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,333
I just want some body heat.

441
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,675
You have a strong heart.

442
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,179
God, I love that sound.

443
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,231
Thank you for saving me back there.

444
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,527
I don't meet a lot of good guys
these days.

445
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,697
I'm not a good guy.

446
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,080
You are.

447
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,584
You just don't know it yet.

448
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,554
Do you think people deserve
a second chance?

449
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,894
Yeah, l do.

450
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:04,818
This is it. Skynet's valley of death.
We never been this deep before.

451
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,905
We gotta be sure the signal works
in their territory...

452
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,115
...on the bigger machines.

453
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,086
That'll bring them in.

454
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,647
H.K. incoming.

455
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,670
Turn it up!

456
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,183
Oh...

457
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,821
lt works, man.
The signal works. lt's beautiful.

458
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,459
Commander Ashdown's on.

459
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,085
Connor, tell me it works.

460
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,172
It works. That is affirmative.
The signal works.

461
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:52,217
Good. The attack commences
tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.

462
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,888
Your unit will be in support
of the bombing of Skynet Central.

463
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,390
What is the extraction plan
for the prisoners?

464
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,726
Extraction plan?
There is no extraction plan.

465
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:05,189
- We're gonna level the place.
- Negative. I told you...

466
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,525
...Skynet Central
is filled with human prisoners!

467
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,361
This is war, Connor.

468
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:15,324
Leadership has its costs.
You, above all, should know that.

469
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,369
Ashdown, come in!

470
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,580
Ashdown, Connor.

471
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,583
Ashdown, come- Damn him!

472
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,599
Star! Get back! Get back!

473
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,942
You have to calm down now.

474
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,959
l gotta get out!
I gotta get out of here!

475
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,851
Blair?

476
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,436
What?

477
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,484
This is us. The mines are magnetic.

478
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,988
If we head due west
at this point of entry, we're good.

479
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,992
I'll go first.

480
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,607
Let's go, Marcus. l'm starving.

481
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,950
PRlEST
For thou art with me.

482
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,579
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

483
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,080
Father.

484
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:32,085
SERENA
This is the beginning...

485
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,671
...of something wonderful.

486
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,215
Son of a bitch is heavy.

487
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,718
What have we got?
He stepped on a land mine.

488
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,261
Start a large-bore lV.

489
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,722
- Keep it open. More morphine.
- l'm okay.

490
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,558
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

491
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:52,105
- He's got a prosthetic limb?
- What?

492
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:55,275
Okay, pulse is good.
Let's see what we've got.

493
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,741
Barnes.

494
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,248
The devil's hands have been busy.

495
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,919
What is it?

496
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:18,340
It's real fesh and blood,
though it seems to heal itself quickly.

497
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:22,302
The heart is human
and very powerful.

498
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,138
The brain, too,
but with a chip interface.

499
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,141
What have you done to me?
- lt has a hybrid nervous system.

500
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,937
One human cortex, one machine.

501
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,106
Blair, what have they done?

502
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,650
Who built you?

503
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,946
My name is Marcus Wright.

504
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,116
You think you're human?

505
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,284
I am human.

506
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,478
MARCUS
No!

507
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,189
No!

508
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,529
Where were you manufactured?

509
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,740
I was born...

510
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,327
...August 22, 1975.

511
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,787
No.

512
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,840
I know you.

513
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,677
I heard your voice on the radio.

514
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,723
- You're John Connor.
Of course you know me.

515
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,434
You were sent here to kill me.

516
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,437
Kill the leadership.

517
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:59,191
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Then why are you here?

518
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,527
Blair said you'd help me
find who I'm looking for.

519
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:09,659
- Now, let me down.
- lf I let you down...

520
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,704
...you'll kill everyone in this room.

521
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:16,583
Just you, Connor.
Because I don't give a shit about you.

522
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,544
I didn't know your name
till two days ago.

523
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,213
No.

524
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,551
You and me...

525
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:32,933
...we've been at war
since before either of us even existed.

526
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,938
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

527
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,067
You killed my father, Kyle Reese.

528
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,403
You will not kill me.

529
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:52,410
Kyle Reese is on a transporter
heading for Skynet.

530
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,580
If l wanted to kill him...

531
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,124
...l'd have done him in L.A.

532
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,841
Where'd you find that thing?

533
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,927
You sent Mihradi and me
to provide cover for some civilians.

534
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,472
- He was one of them.
- Was there a teenage boy?

535
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,142
I don't know. They were taken into
a transport. He was the only one left.

536
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,270
Not "he," Blair. "lt."

537
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,273
It was the only one left.
Don't be naÏve.

538
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,316
It saved my life.

539
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,447
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?

540
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,158
Disassembled.

541
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:36,454
- You mean killed.
- lt may have information on Skynet.

542
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:42,878
I know he's not the enemy. l've been
shot at by the enemy. That's not him.

543
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:47,007
That machine saved you
only to gain access to kill all of us.

544
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,425
We're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

545
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,194
For my brother.

546
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,040
No!

547
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:09,965
Connor wants to see you.

548
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,216
What for?

549
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,844
Like he's gonna tell me, Barnes.

550
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,473
Let me see that.

551
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,856
Want me to tell Connor
you're not coming?

552
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,441
No.

553
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,572
Watch him.

554
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,602
I told you everything I know, John.

555
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,731
Skynet is ruthless
and unpredictabIe.

556
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:11,067
They wilI use the best part of you
against yourself.

557
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,988
And they will have methods
I can't imagine or predict...

558
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,615
...that l can't help you with.

559
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:22,787
And when you're unsure, well,
just aIways follow your heart, John.

560
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:26,374
I love you. Goodbye.

561
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,754
There's nothing
about machines with organs.

562
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,797
That thing in there...

563
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,469
I thought I knew our enemy.

564
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:41,389
But that thing, that makes me feel
like l know nothing.

565
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:47,771
I looked in its eyes, and it believes,
absolutely believes...

566
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,189
...that it is human.

567
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,692
It believes everything that it says.

568
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,986
And it is telling me...

569
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,030
...that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

570
01:07:58,741 --> 01:07:59,991
If that is true...

571
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,580
...then Command is about to bomb my
father and the rest of those prisoners...

572
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,666
...and l cannot stop them.

573
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,758
Thank you.

574
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,511
Come in.

575
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,516
What's up?
Blair said you needed me.

576
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,621
Get in.

577
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,082
Get him.

578
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:00,677
Barnes. What about Blair?
- She made her choice.

579
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:02,470
Get down!

580
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,234
Let's move.

581
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:30,999
Get some light out there!
We're back in the minefield.

582
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,333
I have a plan.

583
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,684
Let's run!
There they go, they're on the move.

584
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,984
Blair, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay!

585
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,153
l can't see back!
There they are!

586
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:02,780
Run! Go!

587
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,627
Now what?

588
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,379
My plan stopped at the jeep.

589
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,342
Sniper Team 1, do you have a shot?

590
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:32,477
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

591
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,612
I got a target!

592
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:51,162
Go! Now! Keep your head down!
Keep your head down!

593
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,998
- Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

594
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,750
Go! Go, keep running!

595
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,633
Come on! Come on!

596
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:11,516
- You all right?
- Let's get you out of here.

597
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,690
There they are!

598
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:39,669
Stay on the ground!
Stay on the ground!

599
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,547
MAN 2 You come
on straight down. I'm going in.

600
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,466
Do not move!
Keep your eye on him!

601
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,218
Flip him!

602
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,263
MAN Iron Gator, this is
Scarface 51. We have eyes on the machine.

603
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,515
Contact initiated.

604
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:49,864
Take my gun!

605
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,774
Check the river.

606
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,916
You see him?

607
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:09,402
Hydraulics are out!

608
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,156
Ahh!

609
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,542
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

610
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:16,135
- They know you, even if you don't.
- Enough!

611
01:15:17,095 --> 01:15:18,846
That gun ain't gonna stop shit!

612
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,933
Nobody's shot you in the heart,
and l see that thing beating!

613
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,684
Kyle Reese.

614
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:27,104
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.

615
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,774
I can get you in.

616
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,026
How?

617
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,326
Look at me.

618
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,829
That's why I don't trust you.

619
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,459
I'm the only hope you have.

620
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,966
I need to find who did this to me.

621
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:58,010
So do you.

622
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,346
SOLDlER:
Connor!

623
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,479
Make your choice.

624
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,732
You get me in.

625
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:18,489
You tell me where l can find
Kyle Reese.

626
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,993
Yeah?

627
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,828
I will.

628
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:34,255
Contact me on that.
Let me know he's still alive.

629
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,012
What are you?

630
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:43,848
I don't know.

631
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,857
SOLDlER:
He's over here!

632
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,236
You all right?

633
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,239
Any sign of him?

634
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,700
He's gone.

635
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:11,709
Why'd you do it?

636
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:15,212
I saw a man...

637
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,256
...not a machine.

638
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,932
How's that leg?

639
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,061
- l'll live.
- Let her go!

640
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:41,656
COMMS OFFlCER:
Connor? Command for you.

641
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,160
- This is Connor.
- Connor, are your men ready?

642
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,412
Negative. Nobody is ready.

643
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:53,417
We are not, you are not. We must abort
the attack. The game has changed.

644
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:56,962
What are you talking about? All
elements are past their release points.

645
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,756
They're in assault position.

646
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,593
Then delay the attack. At least,
delay the attack. l have a chance...

647
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,514
...to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those
prisoners. Give me that opportunity.

648
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,267
No, absolutely not! This is not
the time for a rescue mission!

649
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,937
What you ask for will undermine
the whole operation.

650
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,648
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

651
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,776
- Then that is his fate.
- lt's our fate.

652
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,779
I have to save him. He is the key.

653
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:27,034
The key to the future, to the past.
Without him, we lose everything.

654
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,036
No, you stay the course!

655
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:33,457
If we stay the course, we are dead!
We are all dead!

656
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,502
As of this moment, soldier...

657
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,462
...you are relieved of your command.

658
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,216
You are no longer a part
of this Resistance.

659
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,517
I didn't catch that last statement.

660
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:53,644
Neither did l.

661
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,690
This is John Connor.

662
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:01,110
If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.

663
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,573
Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight...

664
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,159
...our humanity is lost.

665
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:12,371
I once knew a woman who told people
to fear the future...

666
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:16,667
...that the end was coming,
that all would be lost.

667
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:22,214
Nobody wanted to hear her truths.
Society locked her away.

668
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:26,677
That woman was Sarah Connor,
my mother.

669
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:31,015
Now we know that what she
predicted has all come to pass.

670
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,601
Command wants us
to fight like machines.

671
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,854
They want us
to make cold, calculated decisions.

672
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,190
But we are not machines!

673
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:44,153
And if we behave like them,
then what is the point in winning?

674
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:49,033
Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.

675
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,328
I am asking you not to.

676
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:59,376
If even one bomb drops on Skynet
before sunrise...

677
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:02,379
...our future will be lost.

678
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:06,842
So please, stand down.
Give me the time...

679
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,887
...to protect our future that all of us...

680
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,890
...are fighting for.

681
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,311
This is John Connor.

682
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,171
What should l tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

683
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,010
I'll be back.

684
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,292
I'm coming for you.

685
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,381
Come on, Marcus.

686
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,609
Kyle.

687
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,912
Okay.

688
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:24,595
Signal broadcasting
at full strength, sir.

689
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:29,558
- Good. Commence bombing of Skynet.
SOLDlER: We have a green light to attack.

690
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:32,269
This is Bakersfield.
That's a no-go on your last. Out.

691
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,021
Eugene, standing down.

692
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,606
This is Reno. Negative on your last.

693
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:38,734
SOLDlER: Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield.
They're all standing down.

694
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:42,738
They will not attack
unless Connor gives the order.

695
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,642
Kyle Reese?

696
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:15,604
Get to the transport! Go!
Is Kyle Reese here?

697
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,085
Welcome home, Marcus.

698
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,294
We knew you'd be back.

699
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:42,631
After all, it was programmed in you.

700
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:48,470
Oh. And you executed
that programming beautifully.

701
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,305
What am I?

702
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:54,851
You are an infiltration prototype.
The only one of your kind.

703
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:59,731
We resurrected you, advanced
Cyberdyne's work, amended it.

704
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:01,275
You're dead.

705
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:06,571
Calculations confirm Serena Kogan's
face is the easiest for you to process.

706
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:08,657
We can be others if you wish.

707
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:14,454
Marcus, what else could you be...

708
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,290
...if not machine?

709
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:18,792
A man.

710
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,253
The human condition
no longer applies to you.

711
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,630
Accept what you already know.

712
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,758
That you were made
to serve a purpose.

713
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:31,305
To achieve what no other machine
has achieved before.

714
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:38,645
To infiltrate, find a target, and then
bring that target back home to us.

715
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:44,818
We've been at war since
before either of us even existed.

716
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:48,655
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

717
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,949
You get me in.

718
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,660
You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.

719
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,288
- Yeah?
I will.

720
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,295
Kyle Reese! Kyle Reese!
Move! Move!

721
01:29:04,213 --> 01:29:06,006
Kyle Reese!

722
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:08,300
Get to the transports!

723
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:09,843
- Kyle Reese?
- No.

724
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,602
You! Move!

725
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:23,065
In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe.

726
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:27,361
And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.

727
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:31,365
A trick, in the form of a signal the
Resistance thought would win the war.

728
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:34,743
And they were right,
it will end this war.

729
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:38,163
Except that it is the Resistance
that will be terminated.

730
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,748
Not Skynet.

731
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:49,674
Get the attack
on Skynet Central back online.

732
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:52,636
I want our aircraft in the sky
immediately.

733
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,889
Sir. Sir, we've got a bogey
with a very large radar signature...

734
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,225
...closing in on our position.

735
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:09,861
Losenko?

736
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,661
We have destroyed ourselves.

737
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:22,332
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.

738
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:38,974
Our best machines had failed
time and again to complete a mission.

739
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:42,978
Something was missing.
We had to think. Radically.

740
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:48,024
And so we made you. ye created
the perfect infiltration machine.

741
01:30:49,485 --> 01:30:50,986
You, Marcus.

742
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,823
You did what Skynet has failed to do
for so many years.

743
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:57,534
You killed John Connor.

744
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:00,180
Kyle!

745
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,182
Hey!

746
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:13,401
Don't fight, Marcus.

747
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,654
Remember what you are.

748
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,949
I know what I am.

749
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:33,255
I'm better this way.

750
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:36,341
You will not be given
a second chance.

751
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:41,012
- You cannot save John Connor.
- Watch me.

752
01:33:10,459 --> 01:33:11,918
Got a message from Connor.

753
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,504
He's in Skynet, needs air support.

754
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:19,968
Let's go. Scramble aircraft!

755
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,807
Star! Star, go!

756
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:34,774
Star!

757
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:38,194
Star! Star! Come on. Come on.

758
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,677
- What's your name?
- Kyle Reese.

759
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:09,934
Stay with me.

760
01:34:29,872 --> 01:34:36,211
Back!

761
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,932
Come on, Star, move! Move!

762
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,211
T-800s.

763
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,089
There's so many of them.

764
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,735
Careful.

765
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:48,450
- What are these?
Fuel cells.

766
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:51,619
Life source for the T-800.

767
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:55,206
Nuclear.

768
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,042
Enough to level this place.

769
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:01,671
Cover us.

770
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:04,674
Get ready.

771
01:36:08,637 --> 01:36:10,430
This is it.

772
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,206
Run!

773
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,750
Star, come on! Let's go!

774
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:41,836
Get in.

775
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,716
Come on!

776
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:52,597
We gotta get to the transport.

777
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,437
Where are you going?
- l gotta end this.

778
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,356
No, no. I'm not gonna leave you!

779
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:04,442
- You didn't.
- Who are you?

780
01:37:05,277 --> 01:37:06,820
John Connor.

781
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:18,553
Hey! Hey, John Connor's in there.
He's still in there.

782
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,638
Chris, she's hypovolemic,
start a line!

783
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:22,598
- What?
- John Connor's in there.

784
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:24,600
Come with me.

785
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,246
Connor!

786
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:50,960
Connor, help!

787
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:53,296
Help!

788
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,674
Connor, it's Kyle. Help!

789
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:59,529
Do it! You son of a bitch!

790
01:42:26,890 --> 01:43:00,590
Come on!

791
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,476
Let's get out of here.

792
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,828
John.

793
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:22,004
We can't make it back to base.
Set this down in the nearest safe zone.

794
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:31,389
Medevac, urgent.
Severe chest trauma.

795
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:36,185
Call the surgical team.
Remarks: it's Connor.

796
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:55,431
How long?

797
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,936
His heart...

798
01:46:02,647 --> 01:46:03,814
...can't take it.

799
01:46:03,982 --> 01:46:07,360
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Kate.

800
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,362
Kyle?

801
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,126
Take it.

802
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:45,648
You earned it.

803
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,501
Kate?

804
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:13,217
Take mine.

805
01:47:14,177 --> 01:47:15,803
Marcus...

806
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:22,393
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

807
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:26,856
This is mine.

808
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:26,749
What is it that makes us human?

809
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:31,420
It's not something
you can program.

810
01:48:32,797 --> 01:48:35,424
You can't put it into a chip.

811
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,386
It's the strength of the human heart.

812
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:44,517
The difference between us
and machines.

813
01:49:03,328 --> 01:49:08,624
There is a storm on the horizon.
A time of hardship and pain.

814
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:13,963
This battle has been won, but the war
against the machines rages on.

815
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:17,132
Skynet's global network
remains strong.

816
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:19,843
But we will not quit...

817
01:49:20,011 --> 01:49:22,137
...until all of it is destroyed.

818
01:49:22,305 --> 01:49:27,935
This is John Connor.
There is no fate but what we make.
