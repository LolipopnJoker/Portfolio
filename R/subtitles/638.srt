1
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,028
They're here!

2
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,822
Hurry, Muse!

3
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,928
What the hell are you doing?
Why aren't you out on the water?

4
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,931
You know what you're supposed to do!

5
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,102
You should be out there
earning money!

6
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,814
But we caught a ship last week.

7
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,941
That was last week!

8
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,527
The boss wants money today!

9
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,238
Bring Garaad another ship soon...

10
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,114
...or you will answer for it!

11
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,618
Everybody, get back to work now!

12
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,880
Stay out of my way today.

13
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,760
Hufan!

14
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,013
I'm going to get us something big!

15
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,059
Those who want to make money,
come.

16
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,437
Muse, take me with you.

17
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
Does your sister know you're here?

18
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,942
She's selling khat up there.

19
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,987
This is her best stuff.

20
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,998
When we get a big ship,
you will be well paid.

21
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,875
You want to work?

22
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,168
Do you know how to steer a boat?

23
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,546
Go, go.

24
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,214
I'm ready.

25
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,049
- What do you have for me?
-Money.

26
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,469
- When are you gonna give it to me?
-As soon as we're paid.

27
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,098
Spread out!

28
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,728
Let my other man choose his crew.

29
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,690
Next time bring me something
if you want to work.

30
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,704
Come on, Bilal.

31
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,335
Hey, Skinny, I can steer your boat.

32
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,629
If you choose me, you won't regret it.

33
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,925
Okay, Elmi.

34
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,014
I need somebody strong.

35
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,143
Somebody like this?

36
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,280
I want him.

37
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,116
Get out of my way!

38
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,038
Why did he pick him?

39
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,457
He's from another village.

40
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,925
Move!

41
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,053
Faster, move faster!

42
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,064
See if you can get more power.

43
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,234
Okay.

44
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,944
You!

45
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,614
Get over here!

46
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,575
Come help us!

47
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,990
Their main route is packed
with ships...

48
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,161
...but we can't attack a herd.

49
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,712
This one is alone.

50
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,710
She's really big! Get ready!

51
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,214
You worry about yourself, skinny rat!

52
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:04,049
Brothers,
we're going to make a lot of money!

53
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,176
Slow down! The waves are too big!

54
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,307
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

55
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,311
We've got to get out of here!

56
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,940
Turn back, turn back!

57
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,527
What are you doing?

58
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,447
Where are you going?

59
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,826
Come on! Keep going!

60
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,115
Faster, faster!

61
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,587
Hurry, hurry! Go!

62
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,341
We're pushing this engine too hard!

63
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,275
Faster, faster!

64
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,343
Come on, let's go!

65
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,099
This thing is busted.

66
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,684
- Then fix it!
-I'm trying!

67
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:20,485
The ocean was rough. Really rough.

68
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,614
Hufan, I'm telling you,
our boat couldn't take it.

69
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,492
Nothing was working for us.

70
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:30,829
Hurry UP-

71
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,665
We need a bigger one for that ship.

72
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,543
I want this welded by the morning...

73
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,086
...by tomorrow, got it?

74
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,175
Elmi.

75
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,427
When will that engine be ready?

76
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,679
We've gotta fix it.

77
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,515
This thing is old and weak.

78
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,267
It's a piece of shit.

79
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:58,315
Shut up and fix it
for your crew of women.

80
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,447
Why don't you give me your engine?

81
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:10,285
Shut up, Skinny. You talk too much.

82
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,747
I may be skinny, but I'm not a coward.

83
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,464
What did you say?

84
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,800
Say I'! again!

85
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,096
You think you're somebody?

86
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,849
Say I'! again!

87
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:55,747
The coward is the first one in the grave.

88
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,815
Get ready.

89
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,313
They're not stopping.

90
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,982
Show them who we are, Muse.

91
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,903
Shoot at them!

92
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,253
Turn!

93
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,710
It's clear over there!

94
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,603
Untie the ladder.

95
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,345
Shoot him!

96
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,520
Let's go, let's go!

97
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,647
Hurry up, Bilal.

98
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,858
Move your ass, kid.

99
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,841
Stop him!

100
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,575
Higher. Get it higher.

101
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,011
Hook it on!

102
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,825
Get out of my way.

103
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:46,212
Get away. Get over there.

104
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,763
From now on
this one is called Irish, okay?

105
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,940
Hey, calm down! Calm down.

106
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,980
Watch this ugly one.

107
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,366
What are you doing?

108
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,743
I'm going to fix it.

109
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,912
Do you know how?

110
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,664
Hold the gun on him.

111
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,416
I've got him, don't worry.

112
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,047
Don't mess with anything
you don't know.

113
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,258
Come on, man.

114
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,806
- What are you doing?
-Just take care of that guy.

115
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,393
Stop the games.

116
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:33,272
Get that one
and put him against the wall.

117
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,137
Wait.

118
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,183
Take his radio.

119
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,428
Take his flashlight.

120
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,579
Check this room.

121
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,009
I heard something!

122
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,614
Check the other side.

123
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,159
There's no one here.

124
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,494
Please, let's go back.

125
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,594
Look, man, get us out of here.

126
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,201
Hey, take him upstairs.

127
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,120
I can't move.

128
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,747
Take him upstairs
and tell Najee to come.

129
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,866
If one of them moves,
send them to their graves.

130
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,245
Here.

131
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,431
What happened to you?

132
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:41,810
They put glass down for me.
They got me.

133
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,520
Where is Muse?

134
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,896
In the engine room.

135
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,942
He wants Najee to come down.

136
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,608
Hey! Get me out of here!

137
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,652
<i>Listen to what these guys have to say.</i>

138
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:34,821
What happened?

139
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,282
<i>They cut my hand, bad.</i>

140
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:41,161
We'll straighten everything out later.
Just get me out of here.

141
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,538
<i>Give Irish the radio.</i>

142
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:47,542
I'll give it to him now.

143
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,626
Thirty thousand is nothing.

144
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,087
I want millions!

145
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:09,583
Hey, Bilal, check it out.

146
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,545
If anyone moves, kill them.

147
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,755
Kill them!

148
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,543
What's going on, Skinny?

149
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,004
Do what they say
and get me out of here.

150
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,505
Be strong, man.

151
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,560
Watch him.

152
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,189
Bilal, hold the gun on him.

153
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,702
Go!

154
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,685
Go.

155
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,278
Irish, it's only us now.

156
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:21,478
Hufan, do you read me?

157
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,900
Hufan, can you hear me?

158
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,612
Where's your boss?
He should be with us by now.

159
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,615
Don't worry. He's coming.

160
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,663
Stupid hand.

161
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:48,087
Stop whining.
You sound like a little girl.

162
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:52,634
You wanted to come with us.
You asked for this.

163
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,303
I didn't think this would happen.

164
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,722
I could lose my foot.

165
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,975
You have to be ready for anything.

166
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,728
This game isn't for the weak.

167
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,363
What is it?

168
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,908
It's a gift.

169
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,889
Give me some khat.

170
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,391
Why?
You've had more than your share.

171
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,644
Says who? Give me some more!

172
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,103
Shut up!

173
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,356
Both of you, shut up.

174
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,066
Just take it.

175
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,402
This is it?

176
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,614
That's all I have.

177
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,992
- Where is the rest?
-I don't have any.

178
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,202
It's all gone.

179
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,997
You are useless.
I should have taken it from you.

180
01:10:41,863 --> 01:10:44,323
They'll fix him when we get back.

181
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:24,257
He's got a knife!

182
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,305
Go back. Get back there.

183
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,628
Drive this thing right!

184
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,630
Calm down. We're on the ocean.

185
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,175
I should throw you off this boat
right now!

186
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,010
You need to sit down and relax.

187
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,108
That's enough.

188
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,861
Take it away.

189
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,363
From now on this water is only for us.

190
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,208
Stop being such an asshole.

191
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:31,837
You've got to control him.

192
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,547
Just drive and shut up.

193
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,096
Hufan, can you hear me?

194
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:18,926
What's wrong with you?

195
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,511
Don't talk to me.

196
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,995
Hufan, can you hear me?

197
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,665
Hufan, can you hear me?

198
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:10,227
We should be heading northwest.

199
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,439
We've got to get to Garaad's port.

200
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,066
I am, but there's a lot of wind.

201
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,402
- Just go!
-Okay, then let me do it.

202
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,825
<i>Muse? Are you there?</i>

203
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:26,827
<i>Are you there?</i>

204
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,580
Hufan, where are you?

205
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:32,541
<i>I'm having trouble with the engine.</i>

206
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:36,670
<i>Head home.
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

207
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,589
Hey, we're alone out here.

208
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,716
We need you to pick us up.

209
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,968
We've got to get out of this lifeboat.

210
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,679
<i>Shut up and listen to me.</i>

211
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,015
<i>You screwed up getting the ship...</i>

212
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,643
<i>...so Garaad says
bring back that captain...</i>

213
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,687
<i>...or don't come back at all.</i>

214
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,275
I need air.

215
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:25,696
When are we going to be home?

216
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:28,574
I can't feel my foot anymore.

217
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,160
It's like hell in here.

218
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:14,763
You think you have any power here?

219
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,559
- Let him go.
-I should shoot you and be done.

220
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,727
Take your gun off him.

221
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,689
I'm the captain.
Who do you think you are?

222
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:26,984
You're taking his side?

223
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,946
You let the American
do whatever he wants!

224
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,835
I'm losing control!

225
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,751
It's the Americans.

226
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,170
Get something to tie the doors.

227
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,490
<i>Calm down, brother.</i>

228
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:59,660
<i>We're here for the captain, not for you.</i>

229
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:01,995
They have a spy with them.

230
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,042
Hey, you. Who are you?

231
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,294
My name is Nemo.

232
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,130
I work with the U.S. Navy.

233
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:15,759
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

234
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,099
It's not that easy...

235
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,977
...but we'll work on it.

236
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:28,772
<i>In the meantime,
what if I bring you some food and water?</i>

237
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,692
They're coming.

238
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:59,071
Bilal, watch him.

239
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:00,280
Watch him closely.

240
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,960
Open your door!
We are here with your supplies.

241
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,140
Calm down, brother.
We're just here to help you.

242
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,568
Listen, we need to see our guy.

243
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,696
We've got supplies,
food, water for you...

244
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,740
...but we need to see our captain.

245
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:31,455
- They want to see him.
-Bring him out.

246
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,413
Get him back inside.

247
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,081
Shut up and don't move.

248
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,584
Calm down, we just want to talk.

249
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:20,337
We've got your supplies here.
Food, water.

250
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,727
Listen, you're hurt.

251
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,979
We've got doctors on board.

252
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,649
- Let us take care of you.
-Hurry up!

253
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,401
They're treating us like children.

254
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:46,613
It's not that easy...

255
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,740
...so we need time.

256
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,909
<i>We've got to talk about this.</i>

257
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,828
Hurry up, I said!

258
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:15,767
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

259
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,854
- You'll get us all killed!
-Do you have to talk all day?

260
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,940
You're crazy.
What do you think you're doing?

261
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:23,525
All you do is talk!

262
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:26,278
Move.

263
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,780
You have to be strong
to get what you want.

264
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,723
Hey, this situation has gotten bad.

265
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:02,684
There are two more ships,
one on either side.

266
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,562
That one is huge.

267
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,163
Bilal, get the ropes.

268
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,084
The other ropes.

269
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,348
He got out!

270
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,142
Turn the boat around!

271
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:32,936
Bilal, you idiot!

272
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,869
Turn it! Faster, faster!

273
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:55,500
Move, or we'll leave you!

274
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:21,150
Find him. Don't kill him.

275
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,460
Don't shoot!

276
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,258
Stop! What are you doing?

277
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:48,177
He's getting away!

278
01:36:51,097 --> 01:36:54,600
- Don't kill him!
-Better to kill him than let him escape!

279
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:00,732
There he is!

280
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,446
I'm ordering you. Don't kill him.

281
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,341
Where is he?

282
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,432
Here he is! Here he is!

283
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:47,695
He's here!

284
01:38:56,472 --> 01:38:58,057
Are you crazy?

285
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,491
Stop him!

286
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,707
That's enough!

287
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:28,963
Don't kill him!

288
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:33,301
If you kill him, We'll all die!

289
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:38,848
- What do you want me to do with him?
-What is he doing?

290
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:55,156
It's a helicopter!

291
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,492
Get to the other side!

292
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:05,708
Hurry! Go!

293
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:06,959
I'm trying.

294
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,798
Go!

295
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:22,517
They think you are playing games.

296
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,769
Do something!

297
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,826
Do you want to go
to an American prison?

298
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:44,789
Is that what you want?

299
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,375
I know how to handle America.

300
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,418
Give me the pistol.

301
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:52,964
They think I'm playing games, huh?

302
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:54,025
They have no respect for us.
We have to play games?

303
01:41:58,237 --> 01:42:00,740
Give me the radio.

304
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:06,120
The helicopter is coming back.

305
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:32,164
They know us.

306
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:47,430
It's a lie.

307
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:00,234
It's an ambush.

308
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,503
It's an ambush.

309
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,757
You need to be strong.

310
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,093
Don't let anyone in.

311
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,978
Whatever happens, don't stop.

312
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:00,688
It's my job.

313
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,533
What's going on?

314
01:51:47,242 --> 01:51:49,328
I can't see.

315
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:52,039
Give me the radio.

316
01:52:52,474 --> 01:52:55,769
Keep it steady. Keep it steady.

317
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:19,626
If he moves again, shoot him.

318
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:43,442
It's getting rough.

319
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,902
Keep it straight.

320
01:54:33,575 --> 01:54:36,119
What kind of games are they playing?

321
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:39,414
I can't hold it straight.

322
01:54:42,793 --> 01:54:45,045
Be a man. Just shut up and steer.

323
01:57:19,908 --> 01:57:21,701
Stop him.

324
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:23,870
Bilal, stop him.

325
01:57:31,836 --> 01:57:34,005
Bring the rope!

326
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:50,647
Tie him!

327
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,836
What are you doing?

328
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,707
Shut up!

329
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:54,210
Get a blindfold!

330
01:59:11,353 --> 01:59:13,396
Blindfold him.

331
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:07,617
Don't kill him!

332
02:00:07,784 --> 02:00:09,828
The elders are coming.

333
02:00:09,994 --> 02:00:11,371
We will get our money.

334
02:00:11,538 --> 02:00:13,957
You are both idiots.

335
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:15,709
No one is coming.

336
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:37,063
That's it. We Will all die if you kill him.

337
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:39,899
Everything they told you was a lie!

338
02:00:40,066 --> 02:00:41,776
They Will kill us all...

339
02:00:41,943 --> 02:00:44,070
...and he is behind everything!
