# Sentiment Analysis using R

Based on a dataset containing data about the 1000 most grossing movies of all time, I'm trying to find a correlation between the positivity levels of a movie and its sales. My main hypothesis is that a positive correlation is to be found between the level of emotion a movie yields and its incomes. This hypothesis is based on R. Ullaha, A. Zeba, and W. Kim paper from 2015, in which they found that there is a correlation between emotions yielded by a movie and the amount of reviews it gets.
