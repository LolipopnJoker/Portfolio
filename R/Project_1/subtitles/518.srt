The reason they're scared of you: Technically,
you have veto powers over their budgets.

163
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,120
<i>You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen,</i>

164
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,452
<i>each with a specially
prepared question.</i>

165
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,119
<i>They're questions designed for
one thing... to make them look smart.</i>

166
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,525
<i>If you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.</i>

167
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,098
<i>If you treat them
with utter humility, they will.</i>

168
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,634
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

169
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,671
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China,

170
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,174
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

171
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,235
<i>Also, one month from today, you will
give your first official press conference.</i>

172
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:40,148
<i>In it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.</i>

173
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,187
<i>[Man #2] Judge, I just want
to be clear about one thing:</i>

174
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,483
<i>I am not a partisan person,
I am an issue person.</i>

175
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,151
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me,

176
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,818
I will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues,

177
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,262
the most important of which,
in my opinion, Mexico.

178
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,529
I know everyone you're going to meet.
I know what they want and why.

179
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,866
It is important
that they like you.

180
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,202
It is not important
that they like me.

181
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,867
That is why
I can help protect you.

182
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,707
Like you protected Landry?

183
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,043
[Clears Throat]
I see where you're going with that.

184
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:14,175
If I could say one thing: Basically,
a guy like Landry is so autocratic,

185
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,811
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

186
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:21,359
<i>There's a political component to this job
that the general didn't have any patience for.</i>

187
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,560
General, Bob Wakefield.

188
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,791
- Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

189
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:32,233
- Jeff, you want to excuse us?
- [Stammers, Clears Throat]

190
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,805
Yes, sir.
I'll be right outside.

191
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:37,397
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

192
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,477
You've done a fine job, General.

193
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,069
The Office of National
Drug Control Policy...

194
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,671
is in better shape
than when you found it.

195
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,877
I'm not sure I made
the slightest difference.

196
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,387
I tried. I really did.

197
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,391
I think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

198
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,756
I plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

199
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:00,262
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

200
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,801
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

201
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:07,268
<i>District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.</i>

202
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,604
This is a tough enough job.
I plan on focusing on this.

203
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,610
[Chuckles]

204
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,307
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out,

205
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,579
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

206
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:26,420
He said, " When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of,

207
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,086
"open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

208
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,254
"And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of,

209
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,423
open the second letter."

210
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,798
Well, soon enough, this guy
found himself in a tight place,

211
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:44,433
so he opened the first letter,
which said, "Blame everything on me."

212
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,307
So, he blamed the old man.
It worked like a charm.

213
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,972
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of,

214
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,947
and he opened the second letter.

215
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,612
It said, " Sit down
and write two letters."

216
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,815
- [Chuckles]
- [Chuckles]

217
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,323
Yeah.

218
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:17,167
<i>[Woman] Don't you want to
know what kind of car it is?</i>

219
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,974
- It's a brown Ford Explorer.
- It was here. It's been stolen. I want to file a report.

220
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,140
A report will not help you
find your car.

221
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,651
- The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

222
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:34,386
- You call this man... and he'll find your car.
- I don't get it.

223
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,359
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

224
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,487
The police will tell him.

225
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,156
Why will they tell him,
and they won't tell us?

226
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,234
Because we pay him, stupid.

227
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,032
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

228
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,199
<i>Es correct.
Es correct.</i>

229
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,869
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

230
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,709
- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

231
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,249
- No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

232
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,014
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

233
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,147

238
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,162
<i>Bien.</i>

239
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,468
<i>I would say one thing
to you, Judge,</i>

240
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,945
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

241
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,573
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities,

242
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,152
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

243
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:12,587
We in the legal drug business... Merck and Pfizer
and the rest of my very important clients...

244
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:16,457
realize that we're not fighting a war
here with a traditional winner and loser.

245
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,495
I don't know that
you can win this war.

246
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,497
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs,

247
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,966
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs...

248
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,970
- If you reduce that to 10, that's a great improvement.
- Right.

249
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,472
I'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement,

250
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,600
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

251
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,872
Can I get a scotch and soda, please?

252
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,312
<i>[Woman] The price of coke

253
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,077
<i>but purity has increased.</i>

00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,643
All this law enforcement has really achieved
is that kids get better stuff cheaper.

255

Education, rehabilitation,
prevention...

256
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,291
that's not significant
to these reporters.

- Mm-hmm.
- They want to see people in prison.

258
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,363
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

259
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,398
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

260

- Okay. Great.</i>

263
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,875
If a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth,

264
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,877
- I'll do a story on it.
- Right.

265
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,879
- Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

266
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,313
I don't care who's president. I don't
care who the members of congress are.

267
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,317
I don't care
who you have to deal with.

268
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:19,015
If you're independent and you use that bully
pulpit right, that's where your power is.

269
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,024
It's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

270
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,151
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

486
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,994
You okay?

487
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,596
It's okay.

488
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,928
<i>[Wakefield] Caroline, how well did
you know this boy that overdosed?</i>

489
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:02,369
He didn't hang around us.

490
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,203
He was like one
of those hippie kids.

491
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,539
I'm not part of that group.

492
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:14,446
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

493
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,189
He's a friend.

494
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,453
He's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

495
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:27,963
He definitely had
a few beers, but...

496
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,226
it's not like
he wanted to drive.

497
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,859
We just didn't know
what else to do.

498
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,565
It wasn't my pot.

499
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,036
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

500
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,172
Alone.

501
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,053
- I think she's lying.
- Me too.

502
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,718
So let's ground her,
clip her wings:

503
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,093
school, scheduled activities.
That's it till further notice.

504
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:07,466
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment,

505
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:12,770
but don't you think spending a night
in jail is punishment enough?

506
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,107
I mean, we've all
had our moments.

507
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:20,274
- Lord knows, I tried every drug there was...
- I don't want to hear about that.

508
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,251
You experimented
when you were in college.

509
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,253
Shall we take the quotes off
experiment and call it what it was?

510
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,255
- This is different.
- Why?

511
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:32,590
- She's 16 years old!
- I think she needs to find out for herself, on her own.

512
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:36,256
- We have to allow her room to figure out...
- You want to give her room?

513
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,527
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

514
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:42,799
I am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this behavior...

515
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,806
because we do not.

516
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,207
<i>- Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want to push her away.</i>

517
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:53,443
<i>She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.</i>

518
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,041
How long have you known
about this?

519
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,955
<i>How long have you known?</i>

520
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,861
Six months.

521
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:54,928
<i>Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...</i>

522
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,441
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

523
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,103
Our case against him is very strong.

524
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:06,740
He is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

525
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,718
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

526
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,081
My client is no more
a flight risk...

527
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,318
than Your Honor
or the able prosecutor.

528
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,428
<i>He's a pillar
of his community;</i>

529
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,430
<i>a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla,</i>

530
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,000
the community where he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

531
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,035
As our defense
will quickly show,

532
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,037
my client is guilty
of nothing more...

533
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,040
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

534
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:35,509
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

535
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,945
I'm going to deny bail.

536
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,313
<i>[Wakefield] I appreciate you
coming in so early this morning.</i>

537
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,647
<i>[Man] Judge Wakefield,
it's an honor to handle it.</i>

538
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,812
<i>She's a minor. It probably would have
expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.</i>

539
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:23,859
<i>Nevertheless, this is a sensitive issue
for me. I'm sure you can understand.</i>

540
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,487
<i>Like I said, open container,
P.I., misdemeanor possession.</i>

541
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,531
<i>It's easy to make it go away.</i>

542
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,866
<i>One thing bothers me: T he kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.</i>

543
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,997
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

544
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:40,702
<i>So I've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?</i>

545
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,075
I don't know what you mean.

546
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:48,413
I mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

547
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,855
No.

548
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,892
I don't know.

549
00:49:56,993 --> 00:50:00,895
<i>- Is she in any kind of therapy, professional help?
- No, no, no. No way.</i>

550
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:03,966
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

551
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,606
Well, I hope it stays that way.

552
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,084
<i>[Wakefield's Voice]
Yeah, hi, it's Robert.</i>

553
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,985
I want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

554
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:30,185
Because I'm tired of talking to experts
who've never left the beltway.

555
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,023
It's time
to see the front lines.

556
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,083

557
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,085

<i>[Water Running]</i>

559
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,090
<i>[Ruiz] Carlos Ayala started out
in the family connection business...</i>

560
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:16,137
<i>real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats
out of Ensenada, hydroponic strawberries.</i>

561
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,764
Then he met up with the Obregon brothers
of the Tijuana cartel.

562
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,275
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

563
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:25,280
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

564
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,442
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to reduce those odds.

565
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,112
So, you pay off
customs officials?

566
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,782
Well, you know, in Mexico...

567
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:38,122
law enforcement is
an entrepreneurial activity.

568
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,855
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we, uh...

569
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:44,125
We hire drivers with nothing to lose and
throw a lot of product at the problem.

570
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,998
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
It's not difficult.

571
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:52,166
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
It's gonna continue to work for years.

572
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,733
NAFTA makes things even more difficult
for you because the border's disappearing.

573
00:51:55,845 --> 00:51:59,303
Do you realize in the next year or two at
the outside Mexican trucking companies...

574
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:02,476
are gonna be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

575
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:06,488

as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

Tell us something
we don't know, Eddie.

579
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,031
You guys remind me of those Japanese
soldiers left on deserted islands...

580
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,866
who think World War II
is still going on.

581
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:27,410
Let me be the first to tell you, your
government surrendered this war a long time ago.

582
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,536
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help in front of a jury.

00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,014
<i>- It's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.</i>

<i>Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.</i>

585
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,559
Well, I got greedy, didn't I?

586
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,856
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

587
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,364
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

588
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,901
Carl never would have
been so stupid.

589
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,769
Well, Carl hired you.
That was a mistake.

590
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,644
Carl and I have been friends
since we were little kids.

591
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,047

- In the last six months, a threefold increase?
- Increase in narcotics seizures.

597
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:59,436
Would that mean, pro rata, three times
as much drugs is getting in?

598
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,705
That's a scary way to figure it,
but I believe that's true.

599
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,111
<i>In my heart, I'd love to say
that we were getting 60 or 70%.</i>

50% of the total that's approaching us.</i>

<i>And it's all big-dollar issues now.</i>

602
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,356
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

603
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:17,789
It's one organization
fighting another organization.

When things are good,

When things are bad,

when they're losing drivers

- Okay.

646
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,046
Man, I love this place.

647
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,410
I wish we could
just stay here.

648
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,453
Just be here forever
and ever and...

649
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,182
make a little home here.

650
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:49,065
I want to, uh...

651
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:53,632
I want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

652
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,283
Okay.

653
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:40,183
<i>[Gordon] The first time I got
laid was on a beach just like that.</i>

654
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,027
<i>- [Ray] You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.</i>

655
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,823
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

656
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,330
- That's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

657
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,434
Did he treat you good?

658
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,384
<i>- [Gordon] Who's this guy?
- [Ray] I don't know.</i>

659
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,751
- I never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

660
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,161
David!

661
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,632
David, come back here!

662
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,702
- Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

663
01:03:28,804 --> 01:03:31,204
[Man Over Headphones] Shouldn't let
your kid wander off with strangers.

664
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:35,175
<i>[Gordon Over Walkie-Talkie] Karen, if he
tries to move with that kid, you break cover.</i>

665
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,738
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes a lot of money.
Snapping this kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

666
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:42,750
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is gonna disappear,

667
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,480
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

668
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:49,115
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

669
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:17,844
- Javier.
- Yes?

670
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:55,378
[Speaking Spanish]

671
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,850
[Spits]

672
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,743
<i>- John, how are you? Bob Wakefield, pleasure.
- Judge, welcome.</i>

673
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,980
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

674
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,750
<i>[John]
EPIC is very unique.</i>

675
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:39,726
<i>It's a facility that has over 15
different agencies...state and local...</i>

676
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,229
<i>that participate
in gathering intelligence...</i>

677
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,629
and making sure
that information gets out...

678
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:48,692
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

679
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:53,639
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats,

680
01:06:53,742 --> 01:06:55,835
anything that carries drugs.

681
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,278
When the information comes in, we're
able to check with different databases...

682
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:01,281
to see if it's
in the system or not.

683
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:04,113
And would most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

684
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,623
The Juarez, the Obregon brothers... Are
those the two that would be most important?

685
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:11,318
<i>Those are the two
clearest threats right now.</i>

686
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,054
They are the dominant force
in trafficking,

687
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,221
both on the Mexican side
and in the U.S.

688
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,459
How are the cartels achieving...

689
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:22,731
the level of intelligence and
sophistication that they're showing?

690
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,807
<i>- [John] Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.</i>

691
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:28,502
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

692
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:32,308
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue,

693
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:35,577
<i>- they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.</i>

694
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:39,051
<i>- "Way beyond"?
- Our budgetary process makes us pale in comparison.</i>

695
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:46,391
<i>[John] That house you're looking at over
there used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.</i>

696
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,895
His nickname was Scorpion.

697
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,023
I'll let you figure out
what that means.

698
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:53,634
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

699
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:56,033
Best of our information, yes.

700
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:58,606
Who do you interact with
on that side?

701
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,005
Nobody.

702
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,704
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

703
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,940
Your position doesn't exist
over there yet.

704
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,453
<i>[Wakefield's Voice] I want
everyone thinking out of the box...</i>

705
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,527
<i>for the next few minutes.</i>

706
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,290
What are we doing about Mexico?

707
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:25,662
<i>- Come on, guys, out of the box.
- [Man] Unlimited funds?</i>

708
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,895
Unlimited.

709
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:31,837
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

710
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,604
<i>And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.</i>

711
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,611
Come on, guys,
I want to hear from everyone:

712
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,477
F.B.I., customs, treatment.

713
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,212
- Is there anybody from treatment on this plane?
- No, Judge.

714
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,380
Then, I want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

715
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:49,457
Yes, sir.

716
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:53,551
We need to take down one of
these cartels... Juarez or Tijuana...

717
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,721
not because they're a symbol, but...

718
01:08:55,864 --> 01:09:00,767
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

719
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:04,600
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense,

720
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,767
I send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

721
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:10,743
Why? Because it's a symbol.

722
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:14,043
It's a symbol that
we are sending the best.

723
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:18,677
It's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

724
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,255
So...

725
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,416
right now...

726
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:27,086
on this flight only...

727
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,629
the dam is open...

728
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,963
for new ideas.

729
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,774
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

730
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:49,442
<i>I have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.</i>

731
01:09:49,551 --> 01:09:53,453
I learned that back
in Miami in '85.

732
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:55,614
U.S. shut down
the entire Caribbean.

733
01:09:55,724 --> 01:10:00,024
- It's a big game of whack-a-mole. You knock
it down in Miami... - Arnie, I need money.

734
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,461
Somebody... I think it was the Obregons...
threatened David.

735
01:10:03,565 --> 01:10:06,830
They want a first payment
of $3 million.

736
01:10:06,935 --> 01:10:10,166
Oh, Helena.
[Sighs]

737
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:13,639
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I
just don't have that kind of money.

738
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,642
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

739
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:20,306
Yes, there are people that do owe
you money, but nobody's gonna pay.

740
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,249
Carl's got too much heat on him.

741
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:27,482
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

742
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:31,525
- Don't we own a construction...
- Laundromats wash the money.

743
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,822
Just tell me something
positive, Arnie.

744
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:36,658
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

745
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,699
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

746
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,698
<i>I just keep wondering what's
gonna happen if he doesn't get out.</i>

747
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:50,267
Just never been
on my own before.

748
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:54,008
Always had someone. Always.

749
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:06,517
I remember the first time
that I saw you...

750
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:11,565
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

751
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:17,502
Somehow I knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

752
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:21,201
Glad you think so, Arnie.

753
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:25,974
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

754
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:30,211
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

755
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:36,217
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone like that.

756
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,624
Do you?

757
01:15:02,053 --> 01:15:05,079
<i>[Wakefield] I think we
may have found our Mexican drug czar.</i>

758
01:15:05,222 --> 01:15:08,123
General Salazar.

759
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:10,785
Be nice to have somebody
to work with down there.

760
01:15:12,063 --> 01:15:15,294
Does this mean you're
gonna be gone more?

761
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:17,560
Possibly, yeah.

762
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,763
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

763
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:26,604
- Barbara...
- Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.

764
01:15:26,711 --> 01:15:29,874
I think it's important
we maintain a unified front.

765
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:32,074
If you start in
on the war metaphors,

766
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:34,275
I'm gonna drive this car
into a fucking telephone pole.

767
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:37,945
- I am as worried as you are.
- Oh, I don't think so.

768
01:15:38,089 --> 01:15:39,989
"Leave me alone.
Give me some money."

769
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:42,457
That's what I get
from our daughter.

770
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,087
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

771
01:15:46,197 --> 01:15:51,134
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

772
01:15:51,235 --> 01:15:53,396
[Scoffs]

773
01:15:53,504 --> 01:15:55,472
I'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

774
01:15:55,573 --> 01:15:57,473
just to walk in the house
and say hello.

775
01:15:57,575 --> 01:16:00,806
I have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. It's different.

776
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:05,143
- Oh, is it?
- Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.

777
01:16:21,899 --> 01:16:25,665
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

778
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:19,551
<i>[Caroline Flicking Lighter]</i>

779
01:17:22,193 --> 01:17:25,424

780
01:17:25,529 --> 01:17:28,692

781
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:31,131
<i>- Open the goddamn door!

782
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:40,405
Excuse me.

01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:46,138
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:51,222 --> 01:17:53,622
You are not going anywhere, young lady.

01:17:53,724 --> 01:17:56,921
You stay right there.

786
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,600

<i>Where are they?</i>

789
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,974
Fuck you.

790
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:14,044
Fuck you.

791
01:18:14,145 --> 01:18:18,275
<i>I wasn't doing anything.
You're like the Gestapo.</i>

792

Fuck me. Fuck me.
Well, fuck you!

793
01:19:12,369 --> 01:19:14,564
- [Driver] Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

794
01:19:14,672 --> 01:19:17,835
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

795
01:19:17,942 --> 01:19:20,172
- Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

796
01:19:20,277 --> 01:19:22,177
- You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

797
01:19:22,279 --> 01:19:24,679
- Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

798
01:19:24,815 --> 01:19:27,716
- Somewhere safe.
- Where?

799
01:19:27,818 --> 01:19:30,514
A place we have that we know
is protected. He's good. Let's go.

800
01:19:30,621 --> 01:19:32,816
<i>- [Javier] No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. It's really safe.</i>

801
01:19:32,923 --> 01:19:35,619
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

802
01:19:35,726 --> 01:19:38,217
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

803
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:41,059
- This is safe.
- Come on.

804
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:43,531
<i>All right.</i>

805
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:46,158
<i>Where would you like to go?</i>

806
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:49,603
- Huh?
- Where do you want to go, Javier?

Carl?

1296
02:16:35,609 --> 02:16:37,839
Come on, sweetheart.

1297
02:16:37,945 --> 02:16:41,005
Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

1298
02:16:41,115 --> 02:16:43,549
- Who was that?
- Arnie. He's, uh...

1299
02:16:43,651 --> 02:16:45,881
- He can't make it to the barbecue.
- Oh.

1300
02:16:45,986 --> 02:16:48,511
- Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

1301
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:52,124
<i>- [Carl] Hello.
- It's a great party.</i>

1302
02:16:52,226 --> 02:16:54,558
- Who is he, a friend of yours?
- Oh, I'm a nobody.

1303
02:16:54,662 --> 02:16:57,187
I'm the nobody who arrested you.

1304
02:16:57,297 --> 02:16:59,697
- You're...
- [Laughs] How you doing?

1305
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:02,200
- What are you doing in my house?
- Oh, just looking around.

1306
02:17:02,302 --> 02:17:05,703
You got nice shit. Drug money
buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

1307
02:17:05,806 --> 02:17:08,138
Listen, you don't want to talk
that way in my house.

1308
02:17:08,242 --> 02:17:10,369
You're fucking a murderer, Carl.

1309
02:17:10,477 --> 02:17:12,877
- Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- Hey, you can't be in here.

1310
02:17:12,980 --> 02:17:16,416
- [Helena] Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

1311
02:17:16,517 --> 02:17:18,485
- I'm a cop.
- I don't care.

1312
02:17:18,619 --> 02:17:21,918
<i>- [Helena] Get out.
- Hey! Hey, hey!</i>

1313
02:17:28,662 --> 02:17:32,530
- Is that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

1314
02:17:32,633 --> 02:17:34,726
Tell him how you murdered
my partner!

1315
02:17:34,835 --> 02:17:37,395
- You got the wrong...
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena!

1316
02:17:37,504 --> 02:17:40,701
Ray Castro!
You remember that!

1317
02:17:40,808 --> 02:17:43,072
- What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

1318
02:17:43,177 --> 02:17:45,077
- No, no, no, I got it.
- I got it.

1319
02:17:48,182 --> 02:17:50,241
<i>- Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.</i>

1320
02:17:57,057 --> 02:17:58,957
What do you want to do, man?

1322

<i>[Caroline's Voice]
On the good days, I feel like I get it.</i>

1323
02:18:32,593 --> 02:18:36,461
Like it all makes sense.

1324
02:18:36,597 --> 02:18:38,895
I can stay in the moment.

1325
02:18:38,999 --> 02:18:43,800
I don't have to control
everything in the future...

1326
02:18:43,904 --> 02:18:49,638
and I believe everything
is gonna work out fine.

1327
02:18:52,913 --> 02:18:54,847
O-On the bad days,

1328
02:18:56,617 --> 02:19:00,849
<i>I just want to grab the phone
and start dialing numbers.</i>

1329
02:19:00,954 --> 02:19:04,651
<i>I want to pull my hair...</i>

1330
02:19:04,758 --> 02:19:09,024

the streets screaming.</i>

[Sighs]

1332
02:19:13,433 --> 02:19:18,496
But thanks to the people
I've met in these rooms,

1333
02:19:18,605 --> 02:19:22,837
like Margaret and Jim...

02:19:22,943 --> 02:19:25,844

um...

1336
02:19:28,649 --> 02:19:31,049
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna make it...

1337
02:19:31,151 --> 02:19:33,176
through today.

Would you like to share?

Uh... [Clears Throat]

our daughter, Caroline,
