<i>The CIA's

38

<i>refer to themselves as
"The Apostles."</i>

41

<i>They have since adopted
a policy of terror-for-hire,</i>

42
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:13,879
<i>making them
an even greater threat.</i>

43
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,413
<i>They are responsible for
the recent smallpox outbreak</i>

44

<i>in Indian-controlled Kashmir,</i>

<i>along the borders of China
and Pakistan,</i>

46
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:22,613
<i>threatening one-third
of the world's population.</i>

47

<i>The epidemic
is being contained,</i>

48

<i>but intelligence
would indicate</i>

49

<i>that a new client has hired the Apostles
for a more ambitious operation.</i>

50

by this man,</i>

<i>an unidentified extremist known
only by the code name John Lark,</i>

52

<i>author of this
apocalyptic manifesto</i>

53
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,713
<i>calling for the destruction
of the current world order.</i>

54
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,846
<i>It is believed Lark is responsible
for the disappearance</i>

55
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:48,047
<i>of Norwegian nuclear weapons
specialist Nils Delbruuk.</i>

56
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,379
<i>Dr. Delbruuk's security
clearance was revoked</i>

57
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,179
<i>after he expressed
fiercely anti-religious views.</i>

58
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:55,247
<i>Meanwhile, the Apostles
have been in contact</i>

59
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,712
<i>with elements of the Eastern
European underworld,</i>

60
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:00,079
<i>who are in possession
of three plutonium cores</i>

61
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,613
<i>stolen from a missile base
in eastern Russia.</i>

62
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,880
<i>This would indicate that
John Lark and the Apostles</i>

63
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:10,146
<i>are working together to acquire
functioning nuclear weapons.</i>

64

<i>using the materials in play,</i>

66
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:18,612
<i>could complete three nuclear
weapons in as little as 72 hours.</i>

67

man-portable</i>

68

70

but this man's name.

647
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:25,246
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

648
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:28,010
His name is Solomon Lane.

649
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,946
British Special Agent
turned anarchist.

650
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:33,843
He used rogue
covert operatives

651
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,279
to create a terror network
called the Syndicate.

652
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:40,477
Sabotage, assassination,
mass murder.

653
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:43,077
As ugly as they come.

654
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,576
<b><font color="#404040">WALKER:</font></b> He was captured by
American agents two years ago.

655
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:49,811
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

656
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:52,179
passed around from
one government to another

657
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,779
to answer for his crimes.

658
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:00,843
You seem displeased, Lark.

659
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,779
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear.

660
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:07,111
I came to Paris
for plutonium.

661
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:09,778
Well, there must be
a misunderstanding.

662
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,778
I'm just a broker.

663
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,376
I connect a buyer
and a seller.

664
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:18,380
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

665
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:20,879
Extract Lane

666
00:43:21,478 --> 00:43:23,543
and make a trade.

All right.

679

He's in an armored box.

That's John Lark
you're talking to.

685
00:46:12,245 --> 00:46:15,579

If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

691
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:56,344
I wanted Lark to break
him out, not Ethan Hunt.

692
00:46:56,346 --> 00:47:00,576
I wanted Lark at the

693
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:03,711
I wanted Lark to lead us

I'm guessing
that wasn't Lark.

699
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:13,811
More likely
one of Lark's recruits.

700
00:47:13,813 --> 00:47:16,277
Not according
to our intelligence.

701
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:18,413
Intelligence gathered
by whom?

702
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:22,576
Hunt.

703
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:26,209
You've long held suspicions that
Lark was an American agent.

704
00:47:26,211 --> 00:47:27,977
Someone who knew
our every move.

705
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,347
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

706
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:35,343
You're suggesting
Hunt is John Lark.

707
00:47:35,345 --> 00:47:39,810
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

708
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:41,444
It won't work.

709
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:44,843
Think about it. Would a man
as careful as Lark

710
00:47:44,845 --> 00:47:46,942
really stick his neck out
like that?

711
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:49,210
For a face-to-face
with the White Widow?

712
00:47:49,212 --> 00:47:51,977
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

713
00:47:51,979 --> 00:47:53,543
And if he was really smart,

714
00:47:53,545 --> 00:47:56,310
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

715
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:58,511
in front of
a reliable witness.

716
00:47:58,513 --> 00:47:59,743
Me.

717
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:03,210
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

718
00:48:03,212 --> 00:48:05,943
So he pays a man
to play the part of Lark

719
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:07,744
and has him killed.

720
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:10,544
And under the guise
of serving his country...

721
00:48:10,546 --> 00:48:13,209
Assumes his own
secret identity.

722
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:14,611
Free to operate at will

723
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:16,677
with the full support
of the U.S. government.

724
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:18,244
Why?

725
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:20,376
Why would Hunt turn?

726
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:24,177
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

727
00:48:24,179 --> 00:48:27,244
They were believers
in a cause.

728
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:29,510
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

729
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:32,411
they turned
against their masters.

730
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:35,842
How many times has Hunt's
government betrayed him,

731
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:37,976
disavowed him,
cast him aside?

732
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:41,009
And how long before
a man like that

733
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:43,109

a serious accusation.

972
01:17:51,443 --> 01:17:53,708
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

973
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:57,244
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

974
01:17:58,144 --> 01:18:00,077
So what the hell happened?

further instructions.

979
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,477

980
01:18:26,310 --> 01:18:27,377
Now,

981
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:29,942
we meet the Widow
in 20 minutes.

982

She'll take us
to a courier

Absolutely not.

991
01:18:46,244 --> 01:18:47,742
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

992

Benji.

993
01:18:49,044 --> 01:18:51,742
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

994
01:18:51,744 --> 01:18:53,909
and I will do so
at any cost.

995
01:18:53,911 --> 01:18:55,708
Even if I have to
trade Lane.

996
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,107
The real Lane.

997
01:18:57,109 --> 01:18:59,208
And I will never let him go.

998
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:02,342
When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games,

999
01:19:02,344 --> 01:19:05,075
you'll lose the plutonium.
Again.

1000

You let us worry
about the Apostles.

1001
01:19:06,844 --> 01:19:09,442
As it stands,
we have a bigger problem.

1002
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,011
A bigger problem?

1003
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:13,074

1005
01:19:14,778 --> 01:19:16,008
How is she mixed up
in all of this?

1006
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:18,274
She's been ordered to kill Lane.
Direct from MI6.

1007
01:19:18,276 --> 01:19:21,876
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

1008
01:19:21,878 --> 01:19:22,975
Yeah.

1009
01:19:22,977 --> 01:19:24,208
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

1010

01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:27,942
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

1012
01:19:27,944 --> 01:19:29,107
And she will kill me!

1013
01:19:29,109 --> 01:19:30,441

let that happen.

Ethan, how exactly are you

<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> The meeting is a trap.

1019
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,975
The White Widow
is working with the CIA.

1020
01:19:43,977 --> 01:19:46,308
She has been
since the beginning.

1021
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:49,408
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

1022
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:52,107
Capturing the plutonium, and
the Apostles, and John Lark

1023
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:54,541
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

1024
01:19:54,543 --> 01:19:56,241
But if Sloane knew
the meeting was a trap,

1025
01:19:56,243 --> 01:19:57,676
why didn't she just tell us?

1026
01:19:57,678 --> 01:19:59,808
<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John Lark,

01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:01,611
including one of us.

1028
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:05,044
And now her suspicions
are confirmed.

1029
01:20:07,244 --> 01:20:08,642
According to that dossier,

1030
01:20:08,644 --> 01:20:11,475
a trail of electronic evidence
connects Hunt

1031
01:20:11,477 --> 01:20:14,475
to the theft of smallpox
from the CDC.

1032
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:17,041
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

1033
01:20:17,043 --> 01:20:19,141
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Delbruuk.

1034
01:20:19,143 --> 01:20:21,675
And, of course, Hunt
handed over the plutonium

1035
01:20:21,677 --> 01:20:23,409
to the Apostles himself.

1036
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:25,442
Now, those facts,
coupled with

1037
01:20:25,444 --> 01:20:28,676
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

1038
01:20:28,678 --> 01:20:31,110
corroborate a CIA narrative

1039
01:20:31,943 --> 01:20:34,242
that Hunt has snapped.

1040
01:20:34,244 --> 01:20:36,409
And that his search for Lark
is nothing but a cover

1041
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:38,478
to hide the fact
that Lark...

1042
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,545
...is me.

1043
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:44,776
<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> I've got to
hand it to you, Ethan.

Normally, when people refer to
you as your own worst enemy,

1045
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:49,177
it's just a figure of speech.

1046
01:20:53,511 --> 01:20:57,107
I'm afraid Sloane's got some
questions for her as well.

1047
01:20:57,109 --> 01:21:00,242
The Widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

1048
01:21:00,244 --> 01:21:02,545
And where did Sloane
get this information?

1049
01:21:03,376 --> 01:21:05,274
<b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> She didn't say.

1050

on the condition that
I terminate this mission

1052
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:13,208

Solomon Lane personally.

- <b><font color="#404040">HUNLEY:</font></b> Hunt.

That's why
we're taking him back.

what he wants us to do.

- <b><font color="#404040">ETHAN:</font></b> Sir, what do you

A coincidence?

1059

That someone just
happened upon this?

1060
01:21:26,143 --> 01:21:28,541
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

1061
01:21:28,543 --> 01:21:30,708
Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in.

1062
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:31,974
Don't you see?

1063
01:21:31,976 --> 01:21:33,874
This, sir...

1064
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:35,508

- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

1066
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,207
There are still two plutonium
cores in the wind!

1067
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,644
And you lost them!

1068
01:21:44,344 --> 01:21:47,275
In fairness, sir,
we all lost them.

1069
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:50,274
Respectfully, sir,
you weren't there.

1070
01:21:50,276 --> 01:21:54,074
So making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

1071
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,609
Good God, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

1072
01:21:57,611 --> 01:22:00,541
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

1073
01:22:00,543 --> 01:22:03,475
This is as close as you're ever
gonna get to that plutonium.

1074
01:22:03,477 --> 01:22:05,409
Sir, you don't
actually believe this.

1075
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:07,676
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

1076
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:10,245
or the IMF, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

1077
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:12,974
And if I refuse?

1078
01:22:12,976 --> 01:22:15,208
What do you think
he's here for?

1079
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,676
You think
he's some observer?

1080
01:22:16,678 --> 01:22:18,107
He's an assassin!

1081
01:22:18,109 --> 01:22:20,609
Erika Sloane's
number-one plumber.

1082
01:22:20,611 --> 01:22:23,811
You go rogue, he's
authorized to hunt you down

1083
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:25,678
and kill you.

1084

It's the job.
No hard feelings.

1085
01:22:31,842 --> 01:22:33,374
Accept it, Ethan.

1086
01:22:33,376 --> 01:22:35,712

within one-tenth of a second.

automatically triggers the other.

1296
01:39:37,475 --> 01:39:40,408
Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1297
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:43,207
<b><font color="#404040">BENJI:</font></b> The countdown is started

1298

1299
01:39:45,275 --> 01:39:47,710
Meaning once
the countdown starts,

1300
01:39:48,242 --> 01:39:49,710
it can't be stopped.

1301

1303
01:39:58,908 --> 01:40:00,441
So,

1304
01:40:00,443 --> 01:40:03,177

a suicide mission.

1305

Have a seat. Please.

1307
01:40:22,009 --> 01:40:24,274
In all the years
that I've known Ethan,

1308
01:40:24,276 --> 01:40:27,210
he's only been serious
about two women.

1309
01:40:28,076 --> 01:40:29,876
One was his wife.

1310
01:40:30,677 --> 01:40:32,106
He's married?

1311
01:40:32,108 --> 01:40:34,407
No, he was.

1312
01:40:34,409 --> 01:40:36,707
Was?
What happened to her?

1313
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:38,308
Well, she was taken

1314
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:41,173
by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

1315
01:40:41,175 --> 01:40:43,943
It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.

1316
01:40:44,443 --> 01:40:46,277
Then he quit the game.

1317
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:49,574
They were happy
for a while.

1318
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:52,675
But every time something
bad happened in the world,

1319
01:40:52,677 --> 01:40:55,408
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

1320
01:40:55,410 --> 01:40:58,141
And she would wonder,
"Who's watching the world

1321
01:40:58,143 --> 01:41:00,474
"while Ethan's
watching me?"

1322
01:41:00,476 --> 01:41:03,806
Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,

1323
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,009
something truly terrible
was going to happen

1324
01:41:08,309 --> 01:41:10,675
all because
they were together.

1325
01:41:11,776 --> 01:41:12,843
So...

1326
01:41:15,142 --> 01:41:18,107
- Where is she now?
- She's a ghost.

1327
01:41:18,109 --> 01:41:19,773
Good at it, too.

1328
01:41:19,775 --> 01:41:21,574
Taught her myself.

1329
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:24,140
Every now and then,
she sends up a signal

1330
01:41:24,142 --> 01:41:25,443
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1331
01:41:26,076 --> 01:41:28,010
And that keeps him going.

1332
01:41:29,275 --> 01:41:30,875
Why are you
telling me this?

1333
01:41:32,742 --> 01:41:34,607
Hmm.

1334
01:41:34,609 --> 01:41:38,476
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1335
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:42,740
He's a good man.

1336
01:41:42,742 --> 01:41:47,640
And he cares about you
more than he can admit.

1337
01:41:47,642 --> 01:41:51,577
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

1338

If you care about him,

1339

Smallpox.

What?

1384
01:44:20,842 --> 01:44:24,007
Smallpox. The Apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

Lane must've wanted that camp
there for a reason.

- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

1388
01:44:31,775 --> 01:44:35,308
The Nubra River is at the
base of the Siachen Glacier.

1389
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:36,773
So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate

Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

1401
01:45:05,909 --> 01:45:08,173
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

1402
01:45:08,175 --> 01:45:10,639
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

1403

Why not one?

All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

1778

Yes, one.
