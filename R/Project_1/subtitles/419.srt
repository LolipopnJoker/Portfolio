1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,132
Who can name all the apostles?

2
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,179
Yes, Deloris.

3
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:24,727
John, Paul, George...

4
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,526
and Ringo.

5
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,913
Deloris Wilson,

6
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,548
you are the most unruly,
disobedient girl in this school.

7
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:38,765
Now, I want you to march
right up to that blackboard...

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,943
and write the names of all
the apostles alphabetically.

9
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:04,335
This is enough.
You are hopeless.

10
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:06,925
And I wash my hands of you.

11
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,511
Mark my words, Deloris.

12
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:10,888
If you continue
on this disruptive track,

13
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,973
it will lead
straight to the devil.

14
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:17,353
Have you any idea
what girls like you become?

15
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,237
Whenever I'm with him

16
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,989
Something inside

17
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:32,242
- Inside
- Starts to burning

18
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,746
And I'm filled with desire

19
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,582
Would it be the devil in me

20
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,917
Or is this the way
love's supposed to be

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,085
- It's like a heat wave
- Heat wave

22
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,254
- Burning in my heart
- Heat wave

23
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,757
- I can't keep from crying
- Heat wave

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,259
- It's tearing me apart
- Heat wave

25
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,262
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah

26
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,848
- I said, oh, yeah
- Heat wave

27
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:57,435
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

28
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,438
- I said, Oh, yeah
- Ain't nothing but love, girl

29
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,857
Don't pass up this chance

30
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,859
Here's a chance
for a true romance

31
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,526
Heat wave

32
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:17,872
Nothing you can say
can tear me away

33
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:20,040
rom my guy

34
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:21,709
My guy

35
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,712
Nothing you can do
'cause I'm stuck like glue

36
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:28,424
- To my guy -
My guy - My guy

37
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,719
I'm sticking to my guy
like a stamp to a letter

38
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:35,222
Like two birds of a feather
we stick together

39
00:02:35,306 --> 00:02:37,057
I'm telling you
from the start

40
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:40,393
I can't be torn apart
from my guy

41
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,229
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa

42
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:43,939
No muscle-bound man

43
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:47,568
Could take my hand
from my guy

44
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,069
My guy

45
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,573
No handsome face
could ever take the place

46
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:56,076
- Of my guy -
My guy - My guy

47
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,413
He may not be
a movie star

48
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:03,083
But when it comes
to being happy, we are

49
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,710
There's not a man today

50
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:08,713
Who could take me away
from my guy

51
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,551
- What'd you say
- There's not a man today

52
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,555
Who could take me away
from my guy

53
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,558
- Tell me more
- There's not a man today

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,726
Who could take me away from

55
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,938
All right. Wrap this up, okay?
Wrap it up.

56
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,400
I will follow him

57
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:30,735
Follow him
wherever he may go

58
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,406
There isn't
an ocean too deep

59
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:35,407
A mountain too high
it can keep

60
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,993
- Keep me away
- You better, you better

61
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:40,328
- I will follow him
- Follow him

62
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:43,707
Ever since he touched
my hands I knew

63
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,334
That near him
I always must be

64
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,336
And nothing
can keep me away

65
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,256
He is my destiny

66
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:53,592
I love him, I love him
I love him

67
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:55,928
- And where he goes I'll
- Follow - I'll - Follow

68
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:58,763
- He'll always be my -
True love - My - True love

69
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,016
- Rom now until for
- Ever - or - Ever

70
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,519
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

71
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:05,020
Go.

72
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
- Yeah

73
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,611
- I'm a whole
- Heat wave

74
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,863
- Yeah, yeah - Keep burning
- Yeah, yeah - Keep burning

75
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:17,324
- I'm a whole, yeah
- Ain't nothing but love, girl

76
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,701
Don't pass up this chance

77
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,661
A diamond bracelet
and a pair of pants

78
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:24,039
- Heat wave
- Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

79
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:26,041
- Heat wave
- You don't give a shit.

80
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:28,376
- Heat wave
- Let's get the hell out of here.

81
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,711
Heat wave

82
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:44,060
So I-I guess eating is
out of the question, huh?

83
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:47,229
Eat? Your next show
is in 20 minutes.

84
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,356
You still haven't told me
what she said.

85
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:53,068
- What who said?
- "What who said?"

86
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,070
The one with the moustache.
The one you're married to.

87
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,575
You are so damn hot.

88
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,203
And you are so full of it.
You didn't tell her, did you?

89
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:04,871
I knew it. I knew you
weren't gonna tell her.

90
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,373
I knew it.

91
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:11,711
I want us
to be together, babe.

92
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,213
Hmm.

93
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,884
I want us to be
an honest, decent couple.

94
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:18,260
I do.

95
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:20,387
I went to confession today.

96
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,222
You went to confession?

97
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,224
Like confession confession?

98
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:28,395
You know where you kneel in the box, you
tell the priest your deepest secrets?

99
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,397
Well, I did that today
for us, babe.

100
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,066
I told Father Antonelli
I was in love...

101
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,901
and that it was
a special love.

102
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,071
A love for all the ages
and that I want to be with her.

103
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:40,365
And what did he say?

104
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,870
He said that if I got divorced
I'd burn in hell for all eternity.

105
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,079
- Hand me my loafers, doll.
- You -

106
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:48,415
No, I- You-You can get
your own damn shoes.

107
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:49,916
So what does this -
What does this mean?

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,919
- Is this no? Does this mean no?
- No. No.

109
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:55,422
- What does it mean?
- Not no. Just not now.

110
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:58,758
Just get out, okay?
Just go.

111
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:03,346
You want me
to go against a priest?

112
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,809
Get excommunicated?

113
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,356
Okay.

114
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,403
I'll eat the thing you made.

115
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,364
- Is that was this is all about?
- No, that's not what it's about.

116
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,658
It's about you leaving.
Good night.

117
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:24,994
Good night!

118
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,040
I'll call.

119
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:44,387
You're quitting just because
he won't leave his wife?

120
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,473
No, not just because
he won't leave his wife.

121
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:49,559
I'm quitting for a lot of reasons.
It's something I have to do.

122
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,020
- What's gonna happen to the act?
- What do you mean, "What's gonna happen to the act"?

123
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:54,481
You're gonna get somebody else.
It's not a big loss.

124
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,858
Well, you put everything together.
You pick all the music.

125
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,652
You tell us where to stand
and everything.

126
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,612
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm a real genius.

127
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,572
I'm a real genius.
That's why we're packin' 'em in.

128
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,242
And don't you pack any more
of my make-up in that bag.

129
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,661
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

130
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:11,623
- What do you want, huh?
- And don't you ever knock?

131
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:15,293
Hey, girl, you ain't got nothing
that I haven't seen before, all right.

132
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,629
Yeah, well, stop tryin'
to memorize it.

133
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,840
- Hey, Michelle.
- Oh, please.

134
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,801
Hey, uh, Deloris, here.
This is from Vince.

135
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:24,511
- Here.
- I hope it's his dead body.

136
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,804
- With love.
- Oh, really?

137
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:29,057
- Yeah.
- Then why didn't he bring it down to me himself?

138
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,476
Oh, he wanted to, but he's
got a big meetin' upstairs.

139
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,854
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi.

140
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,730
Could you say good night
to these clowns, please?

141
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:38,400
I'm getting a headache. I don't
want them in here. Get out.

142
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,402
- Let's go.
- All right, I'm goin'.

143
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,156
Just take it easy.

144
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,202
Well, at least you got somethin'
out of all of this.

145
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,454
- Come on, Deloris, open this up.
- Yes.

146
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,207
Why should I open this? I don't
give a damn what's in that box.

147
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,334
- I don't care. - Oh, see what the
man brought you. - I want to see it.

148
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:57,711
- Why? - Come
on. - Why?

149
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,504
- Well, I want to see.
- Fine, okay.

150
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:01,965
Let's look and see
what it is then.

151
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,217
- Oh, look at this. - Oh. -
Look at this. - Check it out.

152
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,719
- It's mink.
- Yes!

153
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:08,096
- It's purple mink, Deloris.
- Oh.

154
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,055
Oh, that's beautiful!
Look.

155
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,057
- Oh.
- Feel.

156
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,860
Well, obviously, Mr. LaRocca
feels he can win me back...

157
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:27,198
by sending me this
absolutely fabulous coat.

158
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,575
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoo!

159
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:31,703
- Put it on. Put it on.
- It's beautiful.

160
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:34,873
Well, see, some girls would fall
for that, but not me.

161
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,208
I think I'm gonna make him
wait a little while...

162
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,668
before I just
let him know that I -

163
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:40,795
What?

164
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,928
Connie LaRocca.

165
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,265
It's his wife's coat.

166
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,267
The man gave me
his wife's coat.

167
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,064
- Oh, I don't believe this.
- Put it back on.

168
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,399
It's yours now.
You deserve it.

169
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:05,027
No, I don't deserve it.
I haven't earned it.

170
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,240
You don't earn other people's
wife's fur coats.

171
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:10,283
Okay?

172
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,452
I think it's time to just go upstairs
and give it back to him,

173
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,454
get the hell out
of this dump.

174
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,670
How long you been
with me, Ernie?

175
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:25,340
- Um, three years, Mr. LaRocca.
- Really?

176
00:09:25,423 --> 00:09:27,968
Two as a croupier, one
as your personal limo driver.

177
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:32,305
Ernie, you know what's
important to me, what counts?

178
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:34,808
Loyalty, my man.

179
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,977
Loyalty is what
counts to me.

180
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,896
Well, I've been very loyal,
Mr. LaRocca.

181
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,815
Gee, Ernie,
that's not what I hear.

182
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:43,984
I hear you went down to the
police station last night...

183
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,820
and talked with
Lieutenant Souther.

184
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,447
I hear you were there
for over three hours.

185
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,535
I-I-I-I went.

186
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,662
I went, but I didn't
tell them anything.

187
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:57,789
Again, not what I heard.

188
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,334
Goodbye, Vince.

189
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,379
I'm leaving
and don't try to stop me.

190
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,422
I'm going to L.A.
where it's nice and warm.

191
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:10,886
People don't need fur coats from
their boyfriend's wife's closet.

192
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:14,598
Goodbye, Vince. I'm going to Miami,
where the sun shines.

193
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:19,477
I know they're trying
to get something on me, Ernie,

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,771
but so far they've come up
with bubkas.

195
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:28,195
They called Willy and Joey in there,
but they were out in 20 minutes.

196
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,614
What were you doing there
for three hours, Ernie?

197
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,911
I know you don't think I have
any talent, Vince, but I do.

198
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:38,705
And I'm gonna leave you,
and I'm going to Chicago.

199
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,416
Tell me what you told Souther.

200
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,669
I won't be able to sleep
tonight if I don't know.

201
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:47,756
I've always wanted
to go to New York.

202
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,426
I know if I went to New York, I could
get some things together, Vince. I could.

203
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,928
I could- I could.

204
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:55,430
I could.

205
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,561
That's all I told him.
I swear it.

206
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,357
Thanks, Ernie.
Now I can sleep.

207
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,819
- Say good night, Ernie.
- No, no, no. That's all -

208
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:20,914
Babe. Deloris.

209
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:24,459
Deloris.
Is there a problem?

210
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:27,920
- With the coat?
- With the coat? No.

211
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,882
No, not with the coat.
The coat's fine. I -

212
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:33,593
It's-It's fine.

213
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:36,388
It's-It's fine.
Thank-Thank you.

214
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,890
Is that why you came here
tonight? To thank me?

215
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:41,268
Yeah. Thank you.

216
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,774
And to say you're sorry, about
tonight and the things you said?

217
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,278
Forgotten.

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,113
Completely.
You understand me?

219
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,614
- Forgotten.
- Of-Of course.

220
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,616
It's- Of course.
It's forgotten.

221
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:01,121
That's my girl.
My girl in mink.

222
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,123
- Will you be home? -
Yeah. - Soon? - Yeah.

223
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,544
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

224
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,799
Hey, Vince, is she okay?

225
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:16,886
I don't know, Vince.
She seemed kind of upset.

226
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,304
- She did?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,474
Bring her back, now,
for a talk.

228
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,935
And if she runs,
then what?

229
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:27,105
Take care of it.

230
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:34,320
Deloris!
Come on back!

231
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,499
Deloris,
he just wants to talk!

232
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,967
- Which way?
- That way.

233
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,308
Hey! Hey! Taxi! Hey!

234
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:49,771
Hey! Hey! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

235
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,999
And then Vince looks at Ernie
and says, "Say good night."

236
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,252
And then Vince looks at Joey
and Joey shot him.

237
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:14,795
I mean, he just shot him
in the chair.

238
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,756
Just boom.
He blew this guy away!

239
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,091
Sorry I'm late.
I'm Lieutenant Souther.

240
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,761
- Eddie Souther.
- How do you do? I'm Deloris Van Cartier.

241
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:24,431
Listen, this guy was
a simple limo driver, right?

242
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,309
He was a limo driver. So maybe he made
a couple wrong turns in his life.

243
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:30,145
That's no reason to kill him.
I've never seen anybody killed before.

244
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:32,938
Except, you know, sometimes you pass on the
freeway, you see a couple of people dead.

245
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:34,940
- But it's not the same thing -
- Miss Van Cartier? - What?

246
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:36,942
You're Vince LaRocca's
girlfriend, right?

247
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,403
Well, you could,
sort of, maybe -

248
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,780
It depends on how you look at it.
I mean, the guy just tried to kill me,

249
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,782
so I don't think that
cements our relationship.

250
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,660
Well, you realize he's a major
underworld figure, don't you?

251
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:49,289
He's into drug dealing,
money laundering.

252
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,333
We've been investigating Mr. LaRocca
for the last 18 months.

253
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:55,669
We've got videotapes.
We've got surveillance photos.

254
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,548
Am I- Am I in any of the -
On the videotapes?

255
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,799
- No, no, no. Criminal activity.
- Oh.

256
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:03,595
The tapes aren't enough
to convict him.

257
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:06,180
Apparently, there's a lot
you don't know about Vince.

258
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:09,642
I mean, the last two people that saw
him in action kind of disappeared.

259
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,853
What do you mean, they kind of disappeared? What does that
- What do you mean?

260
00:15:11,936 --> 00:15:15,106
Well, we found a piece here
and a piece there.

261
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,775
But don't you worry.
Here, have a cup of coffee.

262
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:21,320
You're safe now, and we're gonna
see that you stay that way.

263
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:24,615
- That's our job.
- If you help us, we can help you.

264
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,742
If you testify against Vince
about what you saw,

265
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,829
we can put him away
for the rest of his life.

266
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,748
Are you crazy? You're telling me this guy is
a mad criminal, and you want me to testify?

267
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,458
Do you know what's gonna happen?
He's gonna track me down.

268
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,502
- Deloris. - He's gonna kill
me. - Can I call you Deloris?

269
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:38,754
You can call me anything you want,
as long as you keep me alive!

270
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,632
- We wouldn't put you at risk if we couldn't protect you.
- Right.

271
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:45,177
It'll only take a couple
of months to get a court date.

272
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:48,472
Just a couple of months?
Only a couple? Why not a year?

273
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:52,017
- How about a couple of decades?
- Two months we hide you out, then you testify.

274
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:54,521
No! No. No.

275
00:15:54,603 --> 00:15:56,565
It's just for a little while,
then you can come back.

276
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,024
Really? What are you gonna do?
You gonna stick me in a bag and bury me?

277
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,901
Forget it!

278
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:03,487
If you testify,

279
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,532
I'm gonna put you
in the last place on Earth...

280
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:08,784
that Vince would ever
look for you.

281
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:29,222
- Nice church, huh?
- Yeah, it's very nice.

282
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,724
Look, what am I gonna be,
Quasimodo in the bat belfry?

283
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:35,061
- What is this?
- I want you to stay here for a while.

284
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:36,604
Where?

285
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:39,899
In the convent.
It's the safest place in the world.

286
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,901
- You think Vince is gonna look for you in a convent?
- No, no. What? What?

287
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:44,904
- In the what? - The convent.
- You must be out of your -

288
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:47,657
You know what? I'm gonna go back and work
this out with Vince. You're a lunatic.

289
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,951
I'm not gonna be in no damn
convent with these people.

290
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:51,953
These people
don't even have sex!

291
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,666
Deloris, Vince has a contract
out on you for a hundred grand.

292
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,085
- Now you've seen what he can do.
- Look -

293
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:00,504
One bullet,
that's all it's gonna take.

294
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,631
No, no, look. Let me
explain something to you.

295
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,965
Vince knows people all over
the place. You realize that.

296
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,761
He knows people all over the place. That
means he's gonna be looking for me everywhere.

297
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,638
- Everywhere but this convent.
- Oh, come on!

298
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,640
Nobody knows you're here
but me.

299
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:14,600
We're trying to get you a quick court
date. One month, two months tops.

300
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,771
I promise I'm gonna spring you
as fast as I can.

301
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:20,689
What- What am I gonna do here?
I'm gonna go crazy here.

302
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,942
There is nothing but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns.

303
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,443
I'm- What am I gonna do here?

304
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,948
- Pray.
- Pray?

305
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:32,035
Yes, but, Monsignor,
we are a small convent.

306
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,037
Surely, there are
more appropriate places.

307
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,957
We can save this young woman's life and
imprison a parasite all in one gesture.

308
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,792
My heart goes out to her,
of course.

309
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,128
My concern would be she might
subject the convent to danger.

310
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,466
The Reno Police Department assures me
you'll be protected from any harm.

311
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:49,134
They've promised to make
a generous financial donation.

312
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:53,013
And, as you know, your small
convent is in danger of closing.

313
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:56,100
Well, if they can afford
to be so generous,

314
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,102
so can we.

315
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,613
Excuse me.

316
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,992
Absolutely not.
I couldn't possibly.

317
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,872
Well, think of it this way, Reverend Mother,
she's an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

318
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:18,414
That is not a person
you can hide.

319
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,334
That is a conspicuous person,
designed to stick out.

320
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:26,338
You have taken a vow
of hospitality to all in need.

321
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,886
I lied.

322
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,100
Lieutenant Souther,
everything is in order.

323
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,020
No, no, no, no,
everything is not in order.

324
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:43,440
- This woman does not like me.
- Deloris, these are holy people.

325
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,024
- They like everybody.
- I don't give a shit what you say!

326
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,193
- This woman does not like me.
- One month. Two months tops.

327
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:48,527
No, I'm not staying here.
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

328
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:49,988
I'm not staying here!
I'm telling you, I'm not...

329
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,990
- Behave yourself.
- Gonna stay here!

330
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,426
What is your name?

331
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,761
Deloris Van Cartier.

332
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,179
Is that your real name?

333
00:19:15,263 --> 00:19:17,223
Yes.
I happen to be a singer.

334
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:20,685
- Oh-oh. Do sit down.
- Thank you.

335
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:25,189
Look, before we get started,
I-I just want to say...

336
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,066
that I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

337
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,402
I know it must be a huge
inconvenience for you.

338
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:32,696
Yeah, so I-I just, you know,
wanted to say thank you up front.

339
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,662
I also, uh, have always -

340
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,457
and I've said this to people -
I've always admired you people.

341
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:47,378
Nuns, I mean.
You know, you're so...

342
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,713
Catholic, you know.

343
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,507
I mean, look, you're
married to the big J.C.

344
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,217
I mean, you're His
old lady, you know.

345
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,512
It's, uh- It's an
amazing thing to me.

346
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,722
I mean, of course, you must be saying,
"Well, it's much better...

347
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:01,433
than being hooked up
with some kind of two-timing-"

348
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:05,104
Please, do not smoke
in here.

349
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,439
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I -
You know, I get so nervous.

350
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:11,110
I get worked up. I just- I just
had- I don't know. I'm sorry.

351
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:15,781
Look, Miss Van Cartier, we have agreed
to conceal and protect you,

352
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,784
which we will do
to the best of our ability.

353
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:21,120
However, it is essential
that you understand...

354
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,665
that you are not
in a sorority or a speakeasy.

355
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:28,752
This is a convent,
a religious order,

356
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:32,298
and there are certain rules
you must obey.

357
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:35,801
St. Katherine's is a place
to commune and to pray,

358
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:39,931
and I will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion.

359
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:42,850
Do you understand?

360
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:45,061
- Yes.
- Good.

361
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,813
But do you understand
I'm the victim here?

362
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:49,482
Do you understand
I'm the good guy?

363
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:53,277
I mean, they just kind of
threw me in here with you nuns.

364
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,988
I mean, do you get that?
I'm the good guy.

365
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:58,199
I mean, I saw a guy
get his face blown off.

366
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:00,993
So why don't you just
give me the key to my room?

367
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:03,996
I'll lay low. You stay out of my face,
I'll stay out of your face.

368
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,665
And I will commune my little
black ass in that room.

369
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,876
Can you handle that?

370
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:13,881
- I think it's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

371
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:17,009
Well, it's almost lunchtime.

372
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,136
Perhaps you'd like
to freshen up.

373
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,181
And you'll certainly
want to change.

374
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,975
I just hope you don't think I'm gonna
wear what I wore in Catholic school.

375
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,478
No, siree. No ugly
green jumpers for me.

376
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,480
And those stupid
clunky shoes.

377
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,774
Oh, with this gold thing- Could
you have it dry-cleaned for me?

378
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:36,695
Open the cabinet to your left.
You will find suitable attire.

379
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,198
Oh, cool.

380
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:50,875
Oh, no. No, no, no,
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

381
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,797
This is fine for covering a little
bulge, but now I've got holster hips.

382
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,924
People wish to kill you.

383
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,801
Anyone who's met you,
I imagine.

384
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:02,930
A disguise is necessary
to protect us all.

385
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:05,307
Now, while you are here,
you will conduct yourself as a nun.

386
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,893
Only I will know who
and what you truly are.

387
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:10,604
You will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever.

388
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,649
But look at me! I'm a nun.
I'm a- I'm a penguin!

389
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:18,028
As from now and until you leave,
you are Sister Mary Clarence.

390
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:27,121
Mary Clarence? Like-Like Clarence
Williams III from The Mod Squad?

391
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:29,957
Mary is in deference
to our Holy Mother.

392
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,586
The Clarence is in honour
of St. Clarence of Concordia.

393
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,588
There are three vows
every nun must accept.

394
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:36,922
- The vow of poverty.
- Mmm.

395
00:22:37,006 --> 00:22:38,299
- The vow of obedience.
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:41,302
- And the vow of chastity.
- I am out of here with that.

397
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:43,637
Oh, oh, man.

398
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,765
It is necessary to eat -

399
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:49,267
- Good afternoon, Sisters.
- Good afternoon.

400
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,103
I apologize
for my tardiness.

401
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:54,440
I would like you to welcome
a new member to our house.

402
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:56,609
Sister Mary Clarence.

403
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:05,034
Mary Clarence comes to us from
a somewhat progressive convent.

404
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:08,954
However, she's eager to embrace
a more disciplined life,

405
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,583
and I am sure will make every
effort to conform to our ways.

406
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,250
I'll do my best.

407
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,712
- Would you like to be seated?
- Thank you.

408
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,064
- Yes, Mary Patrick?
- Reverend Mother,

409
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,566
on behalf of all the Sisters
here at St. Katherine's,

410
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,321
I'd like to offer a great big hi there
and hello to Sister Mary Clarence. Hi.

411
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:44,907
And as part of the welcome,
I thought that maybe...

412
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,535
our new sister could offer
today's blessing.

413
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:50,871
That is very thoughtful of you,
Mary Patrick, but I really -

414
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:54,250
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can -
I can do that. Uh, sure.

415
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,419
Oh, fudge.
Uh, bless us, O Lord,

416
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:01,674
for these Thy gifts which
we're about to receive.

417
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:09,514
And, yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of no food,

418
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,519
I will fear no hunger.

419
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:18,648
We want You to give us
this day our daily bread...

420
00:24:18,732 --> 00:24:21,359
and to the republic
for which it stands,

421
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,863
and by the power
invested in me,

422
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:27,533
I pronounce us
ready to eat.

423
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,743
- Amen. -
Amen. - Amen.

424
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:31,871
Be seated.

425
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:43,716
Thank you.

426
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:03,485
Gee, what are you people,
a Pritikin order?

427
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:04,903
This stuff is terrible.
It tastes like shi -

428
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:08,907
Sisters, we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence.

429
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:13,036
- Well, why?
- Only when our lips are silent,

430
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,706
may our prayers
truly be answered.

431
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,582
Then you don't have
to eat this food.

432
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,877
Silence begins now...

433
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,922
and ends at sundown.

434
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,465
How can you eat this stuff?
It's terrible.

435
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,551
Mary Clarence,

436
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:30,428
I think you might enjoy
a ritual fast.

437
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:33,390
A ritual f- No. No, no.
I don't think I would.

438
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,392
I'll just put a little salt
in it. It will be fine.

439
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,770
Look, I'm gonna have- Someone
pass me the salt over there.

440
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:42,817
A fast, to remind you of those
who must endure without food.

441
00:25:44,317 --> 00:25:45,735
I- No, I don't want you
to take -

442
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,323
I don't want you
to take my plate.

443
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:50,908
And silence.

444
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:54,054
How can you let them grill me
in there for six hours?

445
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:56,140
I can't control how long
they're gonna question you.

446
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:58,391
- Did you go to law school, Larry?
- Yes, I went to law school, Vince.

447
00:26:58,476 --> 00:27:00,393
- Did you graduate?
- Hey, I'm a lawyer.

448
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:02,937
- Of course I graduated.
- Hey, Vince.

449
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:06,983
Nice talking to you.
See you in court.

450
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:09,862
You got nothing
on me, Souther.

451
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:12,156
And if you don't stop
harassing me, I'm gonna -

452
00:27:12,238 --> 00:27:13,656
What? You're gonna what?

453
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:16,367
Nothing. Nothing, Lieutenant.

454
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:17,870
What my client is trying
to say is that -

455
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,537
Is that he's scared.

456
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:22,207
And you know what?
He should be.

457
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,877
Real scared.

458
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,171
See you around, boys.

459
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:34,385
Something's going on.

460
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,555
He's so damn cocky.

461
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:39,725
Ah, he's bluffin', Vince.
Don't worry about it.

462
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:44,897
- You find Deloris?
- She's gone.

463
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,399
We don't know where she is, and she
hasn't been back to her place all day.

464
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,943
He's got Deloris.

465
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:52,112
We gotta get her back.

466
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:54,865
Fax her eight-by-ten
to every contact we got.

467
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:57,409
- I can't hear this.
- Deloris Van Cartier.

468
00:27:57,492 --> 00:28:00,036
A quarter of a mil,
dead or alive.

469
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,670
This is your cell,
Mary Clarence.

470
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,839
- My what?
- Your cell.

471
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,841
Your room.

472
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,178
Oh, man.

473
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,350
No wonder you waited till now
to spring this on me.

474
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,185
It's like a nightmare.

475
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,855
Where's the rest
of the furniture?

476
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,690
Our lives are simple.

477
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:31,025
We have little need
for material possessions.

478
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,863
This is out
of the Stone Age.

479
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,699
- Where's the phone?
- Who would you call?

480
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,785
I don't know. Satan?

481
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:43,289
Your cell is
more than adequate.

482
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:46,709
Fine. What do we do now?
Pray? What?

483
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,210
It's 9:00.
Pleasant dreams.

484
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,463
W- W-Wait. Are you telling me
we go to bed by 9:00?

485
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:57,386
If I were you, I would use this time to
think about my life and its direction.

486
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,304
Or lack thereof.

487
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,640
There's nothing wrong with my life.
You know, before I came here,

488
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,810
I had a career, I had friends,
I had clothing that fit.

489
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:07,145
Before I came here,
I was okay.

490
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,647
Oh, really?

491
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,148
From what I've heard,

492
00:29:10,232 --> 00:29:13,151
your singing career
was almost nonexistent...

493
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,987
and your married lover
wants you dead.

494
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:19,407
If you're fooling anyone,
it is only yourself.

495
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:23,496
God has brought you here.

496
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,580
Take the hint.

497
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,549
Mary Clarence.

498
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,843
What?

499
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,930
Up and at 'em.
We don't want to be late.

500
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:28,060
- What time is it?
- Well, it's almost 5:00, Sister Sleepyhead.

501
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:30,395
5:00 a.m.?
Get out of here.

502
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,397
I just went to bed
20 minutes ago.

503
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:37,027
- Get outta here. Scram.
- Come on. The sun is shining. It's a beautiful day.

504
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:44,075
We are a small congregation
this morning.

505
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,744
Too many mornings.

506
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:49,080
Something has gone
terribly wrong.

507
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:52,250
Where is faith?
Where is celebration?

508
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,710
Where is everyone?

509
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:57,756
Still, rather than regret
the absence of our neighbours,

510
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,595
let us rejoice in the fellowship
of those present.

511
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,513
Our choir mistress,
Sister Mary Lazarus,

512
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:07,390
has informed me
that our choir,

513
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:09,100
while always superior,

514
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:13,731
has been toiling especially hard
on this week's selection.

515
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:15,149
Sister.

516
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:34,083
Hail, Holy Queen

517
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:37,838
Enthroned above

518
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:42,926
Oh, Maria

519
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,013
- Hail
- Hail, mother of mercy

520
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:50,142
And of love

521
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:55,647
Oh, Maria

522
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,150
Triumph all ye

523
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,695
Cherubim

524
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:04,197
Sing with us

525
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:07,033
Ye seraphim

526
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:09,953
- Heaven on Earth
- Heaven and Earth

527
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:13,581
Resound the hymn

528
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,903
There was a raid on a pawnshop
in L.A. this morning.

529
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:45,905
The place was fencing
stolen property.

530
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:49,243
- They found this.
- Database hoods.

531
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,578
What a wonderful world, huh?

532
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:54,581
"Beloved daughter missing.
Reward of $250,000.

533
00:32:54,665 --> 00:32:56,166
Please find
our daughter, Angel.

534
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,669
We miss her so.
Dead or alive."

535
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,753
Vince is getting desperate.

536
00:33:00,837 --> 00:33:02,214
So where did you
stash her, Eddie?

537
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:03,840
Where did I stash who?

538
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:06,218
Wha- You're not even
gonna tell us?

539
00:33:06,301 --> 00:33:09,429
I wouldn't even
tell the Pope.

540
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:22,901
I'm not gonna get this. This is
a little too complicated for me.

541
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:25,528
Don't you worry. You'll get
the hang of it. I'll help you.

542
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:27,739
Thank you.

543
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:31,075
- Are you always this cheerful?
- Am I?

544
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:33,369
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, I am. I know it.

545
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:37,248
I can't help it. I've always
been upbeat, optimistic, perky.

546
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:38,750
Even as a child,
my mother used to say,

547
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,085
"That girl is pure sunshine.

548
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,755
She'll either grow up to be
a nun or a stewardess."

549
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,507
Coffee?

550
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,593
Enough about me.
What about you?

551
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,595
Yes. What convent
did you come from?

552
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,935
I came from the convent...

553
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,938
of the Sisters
of the Moonlight...

554
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,272
in Reno.

555
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,441
Oh, I love Reno.

556
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:06,027
- You do?
- Yes.

557
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,695
Well, you-you
would have loved us.

558
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,865
We were- We were
a pioneering kind of order.

559
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:14,702
You know, we'd, uh, never wear any
kind of habit this tight, though.

560
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,579
This is really tight.

561
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:21,125
Oh, I must say, our habits do
cut you at the neck just a bit.

562
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:24,045
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear, hear, hear.

563
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,631
That's enough jabber. Vanity.

564
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:29,885
A progressive convent?
Sounds awful.

565
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,011
I liked my convent in Vancouver.

566
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:33,555
Out in the woods.

567
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,599
It wasn't all modern like some
of these newfangled convents.

568
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,059
We didn't have electricity.

569
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:40,979
Cold water, bare feet.
Those were nuns.

570
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:42,772
Sounds wonderful.

571
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:45,066
It was hell on Earth.
I loved it.

572
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,609
This place is a Hilton.

573
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:50,156
Sister Mary Clarence,
when did you get your call?

574
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:52,740
What call?

575
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,075
Oh, the call! The call!

576
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,911
I-I didn't know
which call you meant.

577
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,914
I was working- I was working
in Reno, and I got the call.

578
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:04,669
And you don't know how hard it is to get a
call until you've worked in Reno, you know.

579
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:08,173
We were just- We-We ministered to
a lot of different kind of people:

580
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:11,843
newly-weds, hookers, gamblers.

581
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:15,013
What a joy. How fulfilling to be able to
get right in there with your hands...

582
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:16,514
and work with the people.

583
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:18,558
And Reno- It's probably
bursting with sin.

584
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:20,185
It was. That's -
That's why I had to leave.

585
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:22,687
I mean, we had a hooker
living next door...

586
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,648
called Buckwheat Bertha
who would -

587
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,693
Sister Mary Clarence,
could I have a word with you?

588
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,862
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

589
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,157
Yeah. Excuse me.

590
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:37,535
Get on with your work.

591
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,871
- Quickly, please.
- I was just talking to 'em.

592
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:42,373
Precisely. Enough chatter. Chores.

593
00:35:57,013 --> 00:36:00,850
Rescue me
Take me in your arms

594
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:04,813
Rescue me
I want your tender charm

595
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,650
'Cause I'm lonely
and I'm blue

596
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:13,655
I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me

597
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:21,079
Come on, baby
and rescue me

598
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:24,916
'Cause I need you
by my side

599
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:29,963
Can't you see that I love you
Rescue me

600
00:36:30,046 --> 00:36:33,591
Come on and take my heart
Take your love

601
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:37,929
And comfort every part
'Cause I'm lonely

602
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,848
And I'm blue

603
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,767
I need you
and your love too

604
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,728
Come on and rescue me
Come on, baby

605
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:48,606
And rescue me

606
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,485
Come on, baby
and rescue me

607
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:56,156
'Cause I need you by my side

608
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,617
Can't you see that I'm lonely

609
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,664
Yeah, I need to talk
to Eddie Souther.

610
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:06,915
Yeah, it's an emergency.

611
00:37:08,418 --> 00:37:10,545
- Souther.
- Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

612
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:13,673
- You gotta get me outta here.
- Deloris, you can't call me here.

613
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:15,842
Somebody's gonna catch on
to where you are.

614
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:19,012
But I'm going insane here. All these
people do is work and pray, work and pray.

615
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:21,514
- That's all they do.
- Calm down!

616
00:37:21,598 --> 00:37:24,475
Look, I didn't want to tell you this,
but we got some problems here.

617
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,811
Well, what kind of problems?
What do you mean, problems?

618
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:28,521
Keeping our witnesses alive.

619
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:30,523
I mean, we hide them,
but there's a leak in the department,

620
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:32,150
and some of them
end up dead.

621
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,694
- What?
- Just sit tight.

622
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:37,363
You don't seem to understand
what I'm saying.

623
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:40,200
I am in a nightmare.
This is my nightmare.

624
00:37:40,283 --> 00:37:42,618
It's a nightmare, man.
Get me outta here.

625
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:45,205
I mean it. Don't call me.
It's not safe.

626
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:46,831
I'll be in touch.

627
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:49,709
Hello? Hello?

628
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:09,187
Yeah?

629
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,698
I-I-I brought you something.

630
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,700
My brother gave it to me
when I was a little girl.

631
00:38:22,784 --> 00:38:24,702
I could never seem
to get up on time.

632
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:27,372
So I, um, set it for 5:00.

633
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,211
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

634
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:37,215
- It always made me laugh.
- Out of bed, you daisy head.

635
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:41,718
I thought, being away
from your convent,

636
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:44,514
that even someone like you
could get lonely.

637
00:38:46,641 --> 00:38:48,226
Have a seat.

638
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:58,569
- So which one are you?
- Mary Robert.

639
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:01,572
You have a little trouble
getting up at 5:00 too, Mary Robert?

640
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,658
Oh, not now.

641
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,202
I get up a half an hour early
just to make sure.

642
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:07,995
It's-It's not just
the mornings.

643
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,582
It's that all my life...

644
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:13,834
everybody seems to be doing
or catching on to things...

645
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,253
a second faster
or better than me.

646
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:19,799
Yeah, well, everybody's
playing catch-up nowadays.

647
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:23,011
So, Mary Robert,

648
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,763
did you always want
to be a nun?

649
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,183
Mmm. I always knew that
that was my calling:

650
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,517
to lead a life of service.

651
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,519
But, you see,

652
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:35,023
I've always felt that there's
something inside me...

653
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:37,025
that I-I want to give.

654
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:41,362
Something that's only me
and nobody else.

655
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:46,366
Does that sound
like a terrible thing?

656
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,951
Like pride?

657
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:53,875
No. It doesn't sound like
a terrible thing at all.

658
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:57,337
I'm so happy that you've come
to join us, Mary Clarence.

659
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,598
Do you know how sometimes it's as if you
have to be yourself or you'll just burst?

660
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,101
Yep, I do.

661
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:15,480
Good night.

662
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:18,065
Good night, Mary Robert.

663
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:32,247
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

664
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:10,702
- Hang on.
- Hey, hey, wait up.

665
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:12,452
- Hey.
- Making me run all this way -

666
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,730
Ooh, nice tattoo.

667
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,406
Hey, Sister.

668
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,325
Hey, this jukebox got anything
on it from Sound of Music?

669
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:09,385
Hey, baby
What do I have to do

670
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:13,056
- Want to dance, Sister?
- Why? You don't have any rhythm.

671
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:15,891
To make you love me too

672
00:42:15,974 --> 00:42:19,062
- You got to roll with me, Henry
- All right

673
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:21,563
Young man, take your foot
down off that stool.

674
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,273
Now, have a seat.
Have a seat.

675
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,568
- Baby - Roll with me,
Henry - Henry, hold on

676
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,072
- Sit down and shut up.
- Can I have a Coke, please?

677
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:31,740
- Coming up.
- Thank you so much.

678
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:33,910
Roll with me, Henry

679
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:44,127
Whoa, boy!

680
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:47,590
What are you doin' in here?

681
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:54,931
- I- - What are you
doing? - I thought you -

682
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:56,766
What are you guys doing?

683
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,433
Look, you have to go.
You have to go.

684
00:42:58,517 --> 00:42:59,769
- We -
- Oh, never mind. Go. Go.

685
00:42:59,852 --> 00:43:02,188
Just go that way.
Just go that way.

686
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:08,027
Sister, expecting any more
of your friends?

687
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:12,698
Now, you guys want to tell me
what you're doing here?

688
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:14,868
Well, I-I thought that you might
be ministering to the winos,

689
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,870
the way that you did
in your convent in Reno,

690
00:43:16,952 --> 00:43:18,370
and I thought I could help.

691
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:20,706
And I saw her leave, and it was
very late, and so I followed -

692
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:23,709
What are you doing here?

693
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:28,715
- I'm here to see a man about a car. For the convent.
- Really?

694
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:30,175
- Yes. - Did you get
it? - No, I didn't.

695
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:31,508
- I'm gonna get you outta here.
- We could really use it.

696
00:43:31,593 --> 00:43:33,178
- What colour?
- Come on, come on.

697
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,054
Oh, a jukebox.
Oh, one song, one song.

698
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:38,056
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Do you have a quarter? Oh, one song, please.

699
00:43:38,141 --> 00:43:40,894
Come on. He does. All right. It'll
come back to you tenfold. Thanks.

700
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:43,228
Hurry up. Hurry up.

701
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:48,400
Oh, I love this song.

702
00:43:48,484 --> 00:43:50,570
Give me, give me, give me
Give me gravy tonight

703
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:52,237
What's the matter with you?

704
00:43:52,322 --> 00:43:53,740
One dance. I'll be
right back, please.

705
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,661
But that don't show me
that you're really mine

706
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:03,207
Once they're dancing
when they're romancing

707
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:06,544
So put me something
extra on the line

708
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:09,714
- Gravy
- On my mashed potatoes

709
00:44:09,797 --> 00:44:11,215
- Give me
- Gravy

710
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:13,551
Come on and treat me right

711
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:17,054
- Gravy
- You're the greatest

712
00:44:17,138 --> 00:44:20,224
So give me, give me, give me
Give me gravy tonight

713
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:22,059
All right.

714
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,562
But I want some more

715
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:27,898
There's something missing
and we're on the floor

716
00:44:27,982 --> 00:44:31,402
Come on, baby
I want some gravy

717
00:44:31,485 --> 00:44:34,905
A little kiss
is what I'm waiting for

718
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:38,075
- Gravy
- On my mashed potatoes

719
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:39,910
Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on, come on.

720
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:42,746
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Good night. - Come on!

721
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:45,250
- Go, go!
- I love this song.

722
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:47,418
We had a lovely time.
We'll be back.

723
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,920
- Yes, we will. Good night.
- Bless you.

724
00:44:50,003 --> 00:44:51,755
You leaving?

725
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,049
This turns into a nuns' bar,
I'm outta here.

726
00:44:54,134 --> 00:44:55,385
Yeah.

727
00:44:56,678 --> 00:45:00,265
- Oh, good grief.
- Just come on. Come on.

728
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:02,057
Stop giggling. Let's go.

729
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,686
Quiet. Shh.

730
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:22,870
The sisters have made it clear to me that
they followed you of their own volition.

731
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,873
But they would never have
ventured out at all at night...

732
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:28,041
had it not been
for your example.

733
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,211
But, listen, they just don't want to be
stuck behind these walls all the time.

734
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,173
These walls are the only
protection they have.

735
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:39,469
The streets are no longer safe for them,
and they are certainly not safe for you.

736
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:44,015
These robes no longer protect
our sisters. The walls do.

737
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:45,517
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,188
You really do care
about them, don't you?

739
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:52,649
Yes, I do.

740
00:45:52,732 --> 00:45:55,777
And I care about you
and your life.

741
00:45:57,195 --> 00:46:00,073
I shall ask Monsignor O'Hara
and Lieutenant Souther...

742
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:03,326
to find a safer and more
suitable situation for you.

743
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:05,453
Oh, no. Come on.
Don't send me away. Really.

744
00:46:05,536 --> 00:46:07,455
I mean, I'm just starting
to get the hang of this.

745
00:46:07,538 --> 00:46:11,667
I mean, look, I'm not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else.

746
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:16,172
I swear. What about forgiveness?
Isn't that what you preach?

747
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:18,007
There's got to be something
around here that I can do...

748
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,344
that's not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody.

749
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:23,472
You're right, Mary Clarence.

750
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:27,683
To err is human,
to forgive divine.

751
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:29,519
You may stay.

752
00:46:30,937 --> 00:46:34,524
But I shall restrict your
activities to a single task.

753
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:38,236
What's that?

754
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,531
Singing.
You will join the choir.

755
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:45,368
Choir? No.

756
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,370
You will sleep
and you will sing.

757
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:50,039
That will be your task
until you leave.

758
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:52,249
No. Uh, the choir?

759
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:55,378
I mean, h-h-have you
heard them?

760
00:46:55,461 --> 00:46:58,547
The choir, Mary Clarence.

761
00:46:59,965 --> 00:47:01,550
Is this the choir rehearsal?

762
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:04,678
It sure is.
Come on in, sing a spell.

763
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:09,850
- Soprano or alto?
- Whatever.

764
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,351
Thanks.

765
00:47:14,271 --> 00:47:15,689
- Hi, Sister.
- Hello, Sister.

766
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,232
- Hello, Sister.
- 214.

767
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:30,370
Crown Him with many crowns

768
00:47:30,453 --> 00:47:33,706
The Lamb upon His throne

769
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,794
- All kingdoms
- All kingdoms of the -

770
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:40,297
Mary Clarence,
are you with us?

771
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,049
I don't know this one.
I-I better -

772
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:47,053
I better sit this one out.
Excuse me.

773
00:47:47,137 --> 00:47:50,140
Reverend Mother says Mary Clarence
has a background in music.

774
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:53,894
Really, Mary Clarence?
Were you a choir mistress?

775
00:47:53,976 --> 00:47:59,231
- Sort of freelance.
- Freelance? Really?

776
00:47:59,316 --> 00:48:02,986
Oh. You don't think I see?

777
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,322
You think
I took vows yesterday?

778
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:06,822
I know what you're up to.

779
00:48:06,906 --> 00:48:09,159
You and Reverend Mother.

780
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:10,910
Uh, what?

781
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:12,495
You're a ringer.

782
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,163
She brought you here
to replace me.

783
00:48:14,246 --> 00:48:15,707
Out with the old.

784
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:20,002
Oh, could you help us,
Mary Clarence?

785
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:21,337
Mary Lazarus,
you're terrific,

786
00:48:21,421 --> 00:48:22,671
but we could
really use some help.

787
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:24,924
- Please. You've heard us.
- We're terrible.

788
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:28,135
Please, do something for us.

789
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:32,515
- Please.
- Well, there's a word for this.

790
00:48:32,598 --> 00:48:34,683
Mutiny.

791
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:37,853
So, Mary Clarence,
you think you can do better?

792
00:48:37,937 --> 00:48:40,856
I believe
I'd like to see that.

793
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:43,859
Go ahead, Sister.
Make 'em sing.

794
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:15,181
Okay.

795
00:49:16,432 --> 00:49:17,977
Okay.

796
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:21,020
Where are the basses?

797
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:22,897
Oh, you should
be over here.

798
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:25,191
Uh, and the altos?

799
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:26,693
Where are you?

800
00:49:26,776 --> 00:49:28,862
Sister, why don't you join them?

801
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:31,698
And sopranos, where are you?

802
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:34,367
Oh, you've got
to come down this way.

803
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:39,038
All right, uh -

804
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:43,209
Basses, I-I want you
to give me a D.

805
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,378
Altos, I want you to do
a third above that.

806
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:46,713
Give me an F sharp.

807
00:49:46,796 --> 00:49:50,216
And sopranos,
uh, give me an A.

808
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,885
Let me have Sister Alma
play it one time...

809
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:55,221
so we all know
what we're gonna do,

810
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:57,890
and, and we'll go
from there.

811
00:49:57,974 --> 00:50:00,810
Sister, will you give me
those, uh, notes, please?

812
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:08,567
Okay? On three.

813
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:10,736
One, two, three.

814
00:50:12,363 --> 00:50:14,615
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

815
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:16,784
Very-Very nice.

816
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:19,453
Sister, what- Would you, would
you come over here, please?

817
00:50:19,536 --> 00:50:22,332
Just slide right in here for me,
please. Right. Right here.

818
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:26,418
- Um, that's a powerful instrument you have there.
- Thank you.

819
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:28,921
But I think it's probably
a good idea...

820
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,590
if we bring you down
out of the rafters.

821
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:33,717
I mean, everybody wants
to be close to God.

822
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:36,261
I'm just not sure
you can do it vocally.

823
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:38,472
Okay, so I need you
to sing...

824
00:50:38,555 --> 00:50:40,766
an octave below
where you've been singing.

825
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:42,100
Okey-dokey.

826
00:50:42,184 --> 00:50:43,769
And, Sister Mary Robert,

827
00:50:43,852 --> 00:50:45,771
could you, could you come
stand over here, please?

828
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:49,233
Yeah, come on over.
I noticed that, uh,

829
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:51,819
you're moving your mouth,
but nothing's coming out.

830
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:55,113
So I'd like to just hear you
by yourself, if you don't mind.

831
00:50:55,197 --> 00:50:57,281
Sister Alma, could you
give me an A, please?

832
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,830
Alma!

833
00:51:03,914 --> 00:51:05,832
Check your battery.

834
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:09,753
Give me an A, please.

835
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:15,424
Okay, wait a- Okay.

836
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:18,345
- Um, try this.
- Mm-hmm.

837
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:19,804
Close your eyes.

838
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:23,308
Visualize yourself
in a room full of people.

839
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:26,352
Lots of silverware, people
dropping stuff, talking loud,

840
00:51:26,436 --> 00:51:28,479
drunks, women with,
with trays going,

841
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:30,314
"What are you gonna have?"

842
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:33,484
Your voice has to carry
over the din.

843
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:35,027
You have to get up over
all of that...

844
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,446
to be heard in the back
of the room, where I'm sitting,

845
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:39,575
listening, straining
to hear you.

846
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:40,908
- Okay?
- Okay.

847
00:51:40,992 --> 00:51:43,202
Keep that in your mind
when we do this.

848
00:51:43,286 --> 00:51:46,038
Sister.

849
00:51:53,754 --> 00:51:57,341
- Sister, that's amazing.
- We call that an A with an attitude.

850
00:51:57,425 --> 00:52:00,385
That's what you need. You have to
put attitude in what you sing.

851
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,513
You have to think about what you're
singing. It's not just quacking.

852
00:52:03,598 --> 00:52:06,017
This is -
This is rejoicing.

853
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:09,020
You are singing
to the Lord.

854
00:52:09,102 --> 00:52:10,855
Let's review
those notes again...

855
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:12,355
and see if we can
put it together.

856
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,357
Sister.

857
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:19,697
Basses. Altos. Sopranos.

858
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:22,741
On three.
One, two, three.

859
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:30,373
Oh, we did it.
We actually sang a chord.

860
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:32,876
That was exciting.
That was exciting.

861
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:35,546
Yeah, you sang a chord
for two seconds.

862
00:52:35,629 --> 00:52:39,382
The next thing you have to learn how
to do is listen to each other.

863
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:41,551
That's a big key.
Big key.

864
00:52:41,635 --> 00:52:44,721
You must listen to each other
if you're going to be a group.

865
00:52:44,805 --> 00:52:48,892
- I knew that.
- Mary Lazarus, I -

866
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:51,895
As soon as I walked in the door,
I knew that you knew this.

867
00:52:51,978 --> 00:52:56,232
Now, you're somebody who's into
hard work and discipline, aren't you?

868
00:52:56,316 --> 00:52:57,901
Of course. I'm a nun.

869
00:52:57,984 --> 00:52:59,402
Four Popes now.

870
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:02,363
Four? Wow.

871
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:04,365
How often do they rehearse?

872
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:06,367
Twice a week,
a couple hours.

873
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:08,035
Not enough.
I mean, listen to them.

874
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,037
They really need
a lot of work.

875
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:12,206
They gotta rehearse
every day.

876
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,041
She's good.

877
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:17,211
Well, do you think they
really could get better?

878
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,548
I don't know.
They're pretty raw.

879
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,091
Wet behind the ears.

880
00:53:21,173 --> 00:53:23,217
Oh, please, let us try.

881
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,262
- Please.
- Please.

882
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:26,929
This is gonna be hell.

883
00:53:27,012 --> 00:53:28,932
Tell me about it.

884
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,853
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

885
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:38,065
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

886
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:42,862
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

887
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:47,074
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la

888
00:53:47,158 --> 00:53:51,245
La, la

889
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:58,751
Welcome this Sunday morning,
oh, ye few, but faithful.

890
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,589
The choir, I'm told,
has elected a new director,

891
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,132
Sister Mary Clarence,

892
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:06,719
who will lead them
in "Hail, Holy Queen."

893
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:23,486
Hail, Holy Queen

894
00:54:23,568 --> 00:54:26,197
Enthroned above

895
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:32,160
Oh, Maria

896
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:36,080
Hail, mother of mercy

897
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:39,083
And of love

898
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:44,173
Oh, Maria

899
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:50,094
Triumph all ye cherubim

900
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:55,892
Sing with us ye seraphim

901
00:54:55,975 --> 00:54:57,936
Heaven and Earth

902
00:54:58,018 --> 00:55:02,439
Resound the hymn

903
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:29,091
Hail, Holy Queen
enthroned above

904
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:32,094
Oh, Maria

905
00:55:32,178 --> 00:55:35,598
Hail, mother of mercy
and of love

906
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:38,934
Oh, Maria

907
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:42,271
Triumph all ye cherubim

908
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:45,482
Sing with us ye seraphim

909
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:48,652
Heaven and Earth
resound the hymn

910
00:55:58,203 --> 00:55:59,663
Hey, what do you think's
going on over there?

911
00:55:59,746 --> 00:56:01,915
I don't know, man,
but it sounds good.

912
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:04,585
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

913
00:56:04,668 --> 00:56:07,588
Our life
Our sweetness here below

914
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:11,090
- Oh, Maria
- Oh, Maria

915
00:56:11,175 --> 00:56:13,927
Our hope in sorrow
and in woe

916
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:17,764
- Whoa, Maria
- Oh, Maria

917
00:56:17,848 --> 00:56:20,391
Triumph all ye cherubim

918
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:23,604
- Cherubim
- Sing with us ye seraphim

919
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:27,733
- Seraphim
- Heaven and Earth resound the hymn

920
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:40,870
Hallelujah

921
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:59,931
- Hallelujah
- Hallelujah

922
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:04,727
Our life
Our sweetness here below

923
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,396
Oh, Maria

924
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,065
Our hope in sorrow
and in woe

925
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:14,028
- Whoa, Maria
- Oh, Maria

926
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,488
Triumph all ye cherubim

927
00:57:16,572 --> 00:57:19,074
- Cherubim
- Sing with us ye seraphim

928
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:23,620
- Sweet seraphim
- Heaven and Earth resound the hymn

929
00:57:53,191 --> 00:57:55,986
Girl groups!
Boogie-woogie on the piano!

930
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,988
What were you thinking?

931
00:57:58,071 --> 00:57:59,781
I was thinking
more like Vegas.

932
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:02,409
You know, get some butts
in the seats.

933
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:05,579
And what next?
Popcorn? Curtain calls?

934
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:09,039
- This is not a theatre or a casino!
- Yeah, but that's the problem.

935
00:58:09,124 --> 00:58:11,960
See, people like going to theatres,
and they like going to casinos.

936
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:14,087
But they don't like
coming to church. Why?

937
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,423
Because it's a drag.
But we could change all that.

938
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:18,633
See, we could, we could
pack this joint.

939
00:58:18,717 --> 00:58:20,427
Through blasphemy?

940
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,304
You have corrupted
the entire choir!

941
00:58:23,388 --> 00:58:26,099
- Excuse me. Excuse
me. - Oh. - Excuse me.

942
00:58:26,182 --> 00:58:27,934
How can you say that? I -

943
00:58:28,017 --> 00:58:30,937
- I've worked my butt off with these women.
- Oh.

944
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,856
They've given up their free time
to do this, and they're good!

945
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,235
I mean, Sister, we could,
we could rock this place.

946
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:41,947
Out of the question! As of tomorrow, Mary
Lazarus resumes her leadership of the choir.

947
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:43,657
Come in!

948
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:47,953
Reverend Mother, I just
wanted to congratulate you.

949
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:50,498
I haven't enjoyed mass
this much in years.

950
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,208
What a marvellous programme.

951
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:55,294
Innovative. Inspiring.
You're to be commended.

952
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:58,631
I can't wait till next Sunday
when the choir performs again.

953
00:58:58,714 --> 00:59:00,800
Did you see the people
walk right in from the street?

954
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:03,511
That music.
That heavenly music.

955
00:59:03,595 --> 00:59:05,679
Reverend Mother,
it called to them.

956
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:08,140
It-It did?

957
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:09,558
I must tell the Archbishop.

958
00:59:09,642 --> 00:59:12,394
I'll send him a personal letter
describing your efforts,

959
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:15,563
your bold, new fight to keep
your little convent alive.

960
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:16,899
And you must also
include this.

961
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:18,734
This is something she would
never tell you herself...

962
00:59:18,818 --> 00:59:21,237
because this is the kind
of woman she is.

963
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,573
Sisters, she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people.

964
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:31,412
- Oh, this woman.
- Oh, bless her.

965
00:59:31,497 --> 00:59:34,249
Oh, there are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with.

966
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:36,585
I mean, that's why
many of us became nuns.

967
00:59:36,668 --> 00:59:38,670
Oh, it's really marvellous,
Reverend Mother.

968
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:41,548
- There's a lot we could do for them besides pray, Sister.
- That's right.

969
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:43,258
You're a pioneer.

970
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:48,930
Monsignor, surely you realize
how dangerous this neighbourhood is.

971
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:51,725
And you will face
that danger head-on.

972
00:59:53,018 --> 00:59:55,353
- As if I could stop you.
- You couldn't.

973
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:57,689
You have my complete support
in this matter.

974
00:59:57,772 --> 01:00:01,609
Anything you can do to revitalize
this neighbourhood would be a blessing.

975
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:04,863
Don't you just love her?

976
01:00:04,946 --> 01:00:06,948
Praise you, Reverend Mother.

977
01:00:33,515 --> 01:00:36,935
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

978
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:40,939
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

979
01:00:41,024 --> 01:00:44,943
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

980
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:48,990
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

981
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:52,702
Love has been on my mind
for some time now

982
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:56,622
But you've been
the missing link

983
01:00:56,705 --> 01:01:00,626
With all that's been happening
All this has made me think

984
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:05,047
That love is not for keeps

985
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:09,092
- All I want is your love
- All I need is promises

986
01:01:09,176 --> 01:01:10,969
Once is never enough

987
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:14,640
- Open up your heart and let me in
- Look no further

988
01:01:14,723 --> 01:01:17,100
Love has got me crying

989
01:01:17,184 --> 01:01:20,813
- Understanding my love
- Just a touch

990
01:01:20,896 --> 01:01:23,565
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

991
01:01:23,648 --> 01:01:28,570
- Just a touch of love, yeah
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love

992
01:01:28,654 --> 01:01:31,990
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

993
01:01:32,073 --> 01:01:36,452
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

994
01:01:36,537 --> 01:01:40,415
Music will light
the fires of romance

995
01:01:40,499 --> 01:01:43,918
That could be forever

996
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:48,172
You better bat down a lover
Someone to discover

997
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:53,010
That just a touch of love
is all I need

998
01:01:53,095 --> 01:01:56,640
- All I want is your love
- Come a little closer

999
01:01:56,722 --> 01:02:00,685
- Once is never enough
- Open up your heart and let me in

1000
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:04,480
- Love is burning us up
- Love has got me crying

1001
01:02:04,564 --> 01:02:08,359
- Understanding my love
- Just a touch

1002
01:02:08,443 --> 01:02:12,155
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1003
01:02:12,238 --> 01:02:16,200
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1004
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:20,079
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1005
01:02:20,163 --> 01:02:23,457
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1006
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:28,045
- Just a touch of love
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love

1007
01:02:28,129 --> 01:02:32,049
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love
- Yeah

1008
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:35,052
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1009
01:02:35,135 --> 01:02:40,057
- Give me your love, yeah
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love

1010
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:59,701
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1011
01:02:59,785 --> 01:03:03,748
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1012
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:07,709
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1013
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:11,755
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love

1014
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:15,634
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love
- Eels so right

1015
01:03:18,303 --> 01:03:21,765
Yes, the failing convent at
St. Katherine's has truly come alive...

1016
01:03:21,848 --> 01:03:24,141
thanks to the efforts
of its popular choir.

1017
01:03:24,226 --> 01:03:26,228
What an amazing
turnaround story.

1018
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:30,272
This convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours.

1019
01:03:30,357 --> 01:03:32,442
- Now, as you can see, its doors are open in an effort...
- Vinny, get over here.

1020
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:34,236
- To reach out into the community,
- What?

1021
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,613
establishing facilities
like a day care centre...

1022
01:03:36,695 --> 01:03:38,782
and a food kitchen
for the homeless.

1023
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:41,117
- As a matter of fact, the enthusiasm...
- Vin, you've gotta see...

1024
01:03:41,201 --> 01:03:42,952
- These cute nuns.
- Generated at St. Katherine's has resulted...

1025
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,121
- I'm shootin' pool.
- In a new sense of civic pride.

1026
01:03:45,205 --> 01:03:46,789
- Babe, we should send them money.
- Why all the changes?

1027
01:03:46,873 --> 01:03:48,124
- Well, the nuns I talked to...
- They're do-gooders.

1028
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,668
attribute this reach-out
philosophy to...

1029
01:03:50,752 --> 01:03:54,964
a new addition to the convent,
Sister Mary Clarence,

1030
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:57,967
who, unfortunately,
is a little camera shy.

1031
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:01,304
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her myself.

1032
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,100
In related news,
the Pope visits the U.S.

1033
01:04:06,183 --> 01:04:08,102
And we'll have more on that
in just a moment.

1034
01:04:12,231 --> 01:04:14,108
- Good- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1035
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:17,111
- Thank you so much. - Good
morning, Monsignor. - Good morning.

1036
01:04:17,194 --> 01:04:19,029
- Good- Good to see you. -
Good morning. - Good morning.

1037
01:04:24,201 --> 01:04:25,786
Hey, hey. What -

1038
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:27,621
Are you looking for me?
What are you doing here?

1039
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:30,332
- How come I saw you on TV?
- That was not my fault.

1040
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:33,461
These people just showed up. But it's
been really good for the convent.

1041
01:04:33,544 --> 01:04:35,629
You're supposed to be
hiding out. Remember?

1042
01:04:35,713 --> 01:04:37,505
Bullets flying
through the air at you.

1043
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,134
- Ring a bell?
- Yes.

1044
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,761
But I can't talk about it now because
I have a show in five minutes.

1045
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,556
Listen to yourself. This is
not a career opportunity.

1046
01:04:45,638 --> 01:04:49,058
You don't have to tell me that. This
would not be the place to begin a career.

1047
01:04:50,603 --> 01:04:53,397
Hey, just promise me I won't see
you on the Letterman show, okay?

1048
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:55,566
Okay.

1049
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:57,818
Hey, I'm worried about you.

1050
01:04:57,901 --> 01:05:00,028
I don't want to see
anything happen to you.

1051
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:03,699
Okay. You gonna
come to the show?

1052
01:05:04,825 --> 01:05:07,035
Yeah, I'd love to.

1053
01:05:10,497 --> 01:05:16,252
This Sunday's hymn is inspired
by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.

1054
01:05:16,336 --> 01:05:20,048
Now, Mary Magdalene was
a young lady with a past.

1055
01:05:20,131 --> 01:05:21,758
Oh, yes.

1056
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:24,260
And she was
no stranger to sin.

1057
01:05:24,344 --> 01:05:27,013
She was no stranger
to practically anybody.

1058
01:05:28,348 --> 01:05:30,767
Many condemned her.

1059
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,685
The whole neighbourhood, in fact.

1060
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:36,940
But one man
refused to do so.

1061
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,610
One man said, "Hey, now,
hold on. Wait a minute."

1062
01:05:41,694 --> 01:05:45,447
Listen to the girl's story.

1063
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:56,458
- Hail, girls.
- Hail, Mary. What's up?

1064
01:05:56,543 --> 01:06:01,421
Well, Jerusalem's become
a real drag. Everybody hates me.

1065
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:04,092
Uh-uh. Not that guy over there.

1066
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:06,593
Who? Him? They all
say he's different.

1067
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:08,762
They say he's really weird.

1068
01:06:08,846 --> 01:06:12,934
We don't care what people say.
To us, he's always there.

1069
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:14,435
Really?

1070
01:06:18,064 --> 01:06:23,444
Nothing you could say
could tear me away from my God

1071
01:06:23,527 --> 01:06:25,404
My God

1072
01:06:25,487 --> 01:06:28,615
Nothing you could do
'cause I'm stuck like glue

1073
01:06:28,699 --> 01:06:32,202
- To my God -
My God - My God

1074
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:35,914
I'm sticking to my God
like a stamp to a letter

1075
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:39,626
Like birds of a feather
we stick together

1076
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:41,545
I'm telling you
from the start

1077
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:45,298
I can't be torn apart
from my God

1078
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,553
Nothing you could do
could make me untrue

1079
01:06:50,637 --> 01:06:54,475
- To my God
- My God

1080
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:57,811
Nothing you could buy
could make me tell a lie

1081
01:06:57,895 --> 01:07:01,397
- To my God -
My God - My God

1082
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:05,276
I gave my God
my word of honour

1083
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,781
- To be faithful
- And I'm gonna

1084
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:14,243
- You best be believing
- I won't be deceiving my God

1085
01:07:15,746 --> 01:07:19,750
As a matter of opinion
I think He's tops

1086
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:23,002
- My opinion is He's the cream of the crop
- Cream of the crop

1087
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:27,131
- As a matter of taste
- To be exact

1088
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:30,176
- He's my ideal
- As a matter of fact

1089
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:33,763
No muscle-bound man
could take my hand

1090
01:07:33,846 --> 01:07:35,932
rom my God

1091
01:07:36,015 --> 01:07:37,600
My God

1092
01:07:37,683 --> 01:07:41,104
No handsome face
could ever take the place

1093
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:44,607
- Of my God -
My God - My God

1094
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:48,110
He may not be
a movie star

1095
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:52,031
- But when it comes to being happy
- We are

1096
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:53,866
There's not a man today

1097
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:57,410
Who could take me away
from my God

1098
01:07:57,495 --> 01:07:59,038
Let's take it home, ladies.

1099
01:07:59,121 --> 01:08:01,040
There's not a man today

1100
01:08:01,123 --> 01:08:04,460
Who could take me away
from my God

1101
01:08:04,543 --> 01:08:06,462
Give them some of that
deep-shoulder action.

1102
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,380
There's not a man today

1103
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:12,844
Who could take me away
from my God

1104
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,195
I think Sister Mary Patrick
was the best.

1105
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,947
- You were wonderful.
- I wasn't very good.

1106
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,907
- You were fabulous. - You
were very good too. - Ladies.

1107
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:40,078
- I think -
- Ladies, you were fantastic.

1108
01:08:40,162 --> 01:08:42,747
- Sisters, you did good. -
Fantastic. - Oh, I'm so excited.

1109
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:44,749
I can't wait till Sunday
when we sing.

1110
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:47,084
- I'd rather sing than do anything.
- It's better than ice cream.

1111
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,087
- It's better than springtime.
- It's better than sex.

1112
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:52,424
- Oh?
- No, no, I-I've heard, you know.

1113
01:08:52,506 --> 01:08:55,010
Sisters, you're truly
an inspiration.

1114
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:58,263
And I've asked you here because
I bear remarkable news.

1115
01:08:58,345 --> 01:08:59,848
Now try to remain calm.

1116
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,058
What I'm about to say is
nothing short of a miracle.

1117
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:05,145
Well, I didn't believe it
myself at first.

1118
01:09:05,227 --> 01:09:07,689
Monsignor, for goodness sake,
what is it?

1119
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:12,067
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. It's just that it's so
momentous, I'm still adjusting to the shock.

1120
01:09:12,151 --> 01:09:14,404
The Pope -
the Pope himself -

1121
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:16,823
has heard of our choir
here at St. Katherine's.

1122
01:09:16,906 --> 01:09:19,242
And when he visits
San Francisco next weekend,

1123
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,577
despite his inordinately
busy schedule,

1124
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:24,997
he's requested a special concert
here on Sunday night.

1125
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:26,916
No. No.

1126
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:29,168
Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying.

1127
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:34,256
Oh, Sisters. Oh, Sisters,
this is indeed glorious news.

1128
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,426
Oh, Monsignor, we're-we're
both humbled and honoured.

1129
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,137
And on such a supremely
solemn occasion,

1130
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:43,474
I do feel a traditional
programme would be best.

1131
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:45,893
You mean "traditional"
like the old way?

1132
01:09:45,976 --> 01:09:48,437
We're speaking of His Holiness,
Mary Clarence,

1133
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:50,606
not a neighbourhood block party.

1134
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:54,276
The pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility.

1135
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,988
Your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place.

1136
01:09:58,072 --> 01:10:00,282
But-But, Reverend Mother,
everyone loves our new style.

1137
01:10:00,366 --> 01:10:02,200
It's brought people
back to the church.

1138
01:10:02,284 --> 01:10:05,788
And that's why he's coming. I mean, because
we're doing something new and different.

1139
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:08,666
Well, I feel this can be
settled by a simple vote.

1140
01:10:08,748 --> 01:10:12,293
- A vote?
- Of course, Mary Clarence.

1141
01:10:12,378 --> 01:10:13,796
A convent
is not a police state.

1142
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:16,131
I'm-I'm sure the sisters
are more than capable...

1143
01:10:16,215 --> 01:10:19,467
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus.

1144
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:22,470
Right. Now, all those in favour
of performing a programme...

1145
01:10:22,554 --> 01:10:24,640
of time-honoured sacred music,

1146
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:27,643
a truly spiritual repertoire,

1147
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:29,310
raise your hands.

1148
01:10:37,903 --> 01:10:40,155
All those in favour
of allowing Mary Clarence...

1149
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:44,492
to select a more worldly programme,
however inappropriate,

1150
01:10:44,576 --> 01:10:46,369
raise your hands.

1151
01:10:57,922 --> 01:11:00,007
The majority has spoken.

1152
01:11:00,091 --> 01:11:02,761
Reverend Mother, as always,
you're a true leader -

1153
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:04,428
gracious and understanding.

1154
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:07,306
Oh, it's gonna be wonderful,
Reverend Mother. You'll see.

1155
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:10,434
I'm sure the presentation
will be a great success.

1156
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:12,436
Congratulations,
Mary Clarence.

1157
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:18,108
And congratulations
to you all.

1158
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:24,032
His Holiness. Now,
we've got to get busy.

1159
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:29,119
Come in.

1160
01:11:30,872 --> 01:11:34,584
- You sent for me?
- You have a phone call.

1161
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,418
From who?

1162
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:38,921
Lieutenant Souther.

1163
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:40,422
Oh.

1164
01:11:44,051 --> 01:11:45,928
Hello?

1165
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:48,472
Hey, Deloris. Great news.

1166
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,809
I pulled some strings. The judge
agreed to move up their trial.

1167
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,602
We'll be in court
in a couple days.

1168
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,231
Really? That soon?

1169
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,398
Forty-eight hours,
you're a free woman.

1170
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,277
Oh, gee, it's great.

1171
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:06,448
Yeah, well, that's -
That's great.

1172
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,658
Hey, well, don't thank me
or anything.

1173
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,452
No, rea- No, I -
It is. No, thank you.

1174
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,955
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's- Thank you.

1175
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,457
Yeah.

1176
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,625
All right. Bye.

1177
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:25,300
Well, seems like your prayers
have been answered.

1178
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:29,095
Uh, I'm gonna be outta here
in a week. I'm leaving.

1179
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,140
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

1180
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:34,308
- That makes two of us.
- What do you mean?

1181
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:38,981
I have submitted my resignation
to Monsignor O'Hara, privately.

1182
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:42,316
I've asked to be relocated
as soon as possible.

1183
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:45,112
But why?

1184
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,655
I must go where
I can be of use.

1185
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,992
But there's -

1186
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:53,828
There's still so much
to be done here.

1187
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,997
Look, if it's about me,
I-I-I'm gonna be gone.

1188
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:57,832
Indeed.

1189
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,168
And after how long,
a few weeks?

1190
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:04,422
I have been here for years.
Well, too long, I suppose.

1191
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:06,089
I've become somewhat obsolete.

1192
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:09,260
But you don't have
to continue being obsolete.

1193
01:13:09,342 --> 01:13:12,263
Look, everything that's happening here
is-is-is a good thing.

1194
01:13:12,345 --> 01:13:14,222
Sister, you can still be
part of it.

1195
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,434
A part of what?

1196
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:19,270
You know, Mary Clarence, it is
one thing to rabble rouse,

1197
01:13:19,352 --> 01:13:22,022
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday.

1198
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,441
You've raised
the sisters' expectations.

1199
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,944
You've- You've excited
and confused them.

1200
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:30,447
They imagine this neighbourhood to be
some sort of delightful ongoing bake sale.

1201
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:34,034
Now, you and I know
things are not so simple.

1202
01:13:34,117 --> 01:13:37,287
There'll be disappointments
and rude shocks.

1203
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,956
And you will have vanished.

1204
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,124
How fortunate.

1205
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,961
Look, I just got things going.

1206
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:49,007
You are a formidable woman.
You could keep this going.

1207
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,801
Could I?

1208
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,136
Even if I wanted to, no.

1209
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,472
I fear I am a relic.

1210
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:58,600
And I have misplaced
my tambourine.

1211
01:13:58,683 --> 01:14:01,686
- Good day, Mary Clarence.
- But, Sister, I -

1212
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:03,563
Good day.

1213
01:14:06,983 --> 01:14:08,777
Good day.

1214
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:11,737
- Don't peek. - How can I peek?
- You can look to the right.

1215
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,824
- That's right, don't peek.
- Where can I look?

1216
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:16,409
- You ready? - You've
got my eyes- - Ta-da!

1217
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,411
Crazy women.
What have you done?

1218
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,329
- What is this?
- It's ice cream.

1219
01:14:20,412 --> 01:14:22,414
- I know that, but -
- Well, it's a great big...

1220
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:25,417
cuddly bear hug of a thank-you
from us to you.

1221
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,586
- Not thank you to me, thank you to you.
- No, you.

1222
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,256
I mean -
When did you do this?

1223
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:33,592
This is a sin.
It's a wicked indulgence.

1224
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:35,762
Didn't they have
any butter pecan?

1225
01:14:35,845 --> 01:14:38,640
- I hope Reverend Mother doesn't catch us.
- Yeah, let's keep it down.

1226
01:14:38,722 --> 01:14:39,974
Is there any syrup?

1227
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,268
Mary Clarence,
this morning in prayers,

1228
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:44,771
I thanked God
for bringing you to us.

1229
01:14:44,854 --> 01:14:47,440
Since you've come,
everything has just happened.

1230
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:49,775
Our choir is famous, for one.

1231
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:52,278
We could cut a demo.

1232
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:53,779
I could learn guitar.

1233
01:14:56,031 --> 01:14:58,450
Yeah, anything is possible.
God works in mysterious ways.

1234
01:14:58,534 --> 01:15:03,080
- That's true.
- You know, uh, anything could happen.

1235
01:15:03,163 --> 01:15:06,917
I mean, any one of us could be
transferred out of here at any given time.

1236
01:15:08,001 --> 01:15:09,753
Are you leaving us?

1237
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:13,257
No. Come on, no.

1238
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:16,761
What are you talking about? No,
we're always gonna be together.

1239
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:20,430
That's what Diana Ross said.

1240
01:15:24,517 --> 01:15:26,771
Oh, well. Listen, that was
a trio. We're a quartet.

1241
01:15:26,853 --> 01:15:28,481
- Listen. You know, it's true.
- I know that.

1242
01:15:28,563 --> 01:15:29,814
- I believe in things like that.
- Okay -

1243
01:15:31,274 --> 01:15:34,612
Just missed him.
Souther just stepped out.

1244
01:15:34,694 --> 01:15:36,279
I need his signature
on some things.

1245
01:15:36,362 --> 01:15:39,282
Uh, this stuff can't be
processed without him.

1246
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:42,619
Just leave it here, Henry. Uh, I'll
make sure he signs it when he comes in.

1247
01:15:44,662 --> 01:15:46,331
Here.

1248
01:16:09,145 --> 01:16:10,563
We found her.

1249
01:16:11,648 --> 01:16:13,191
Beautiful work.

1250
01:16:13,274 --> 01:16:14,609
What's the address?

1251
01:16:14,691 --> 01:16:18,237
It's Church Street at 29th
in San Francisco.

1252
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:20,907
Thought you were gone.

1253
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,742
Get all the way
to the car, no keys.

1254
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:26,078
Tate said to leave
the money vouchers with him.

1255
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:28,247
He said you'd sign them later.

1256
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:39,049
St. Katherine's.

1257
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:45,806
- Here's our leak, boys.
- Come on.

1258
01:16:45,889 --> 01:16:47,391
Plug him up!

1259
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,018
- Get him outta here.
- Let's go, Tate.

1260
01:16:50,853 --> 01:16:52,771
The Pope. Tomorrow.

1261
01:16:52,855 --> 01:16:54,273
Oh, my gosh,
I'll be so nervous.

1262
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:56,275
What if I forget the words?

1263
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:58,444
You're gonna go
straight to hell.

1264
01:16:58,527 --> 01:16:59,778
- I'm kidding. - Uh- -
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

1265
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:01,905
Come on, Sisters.
Rehearsal in five minutes.

1266
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:04,283
- Go to rehearsal. I'll be there
in a minute. - Come on. - Right.

1267
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,079
Get in.

1268
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:17,588
One, two, three and slide.
One, two, three and slide.

1269
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:21,091
One, two, three and slide.
Sister, take over now.

1270
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:24,428
One, two, three, together.
One, two, three, together.

1271
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:28,931
One, two, three, together.
Left. Right.

1272
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:30,767
- Oh, come in.
- Where's Deloris?

1273
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:32,561
- Why? Is something wrong?
- They know she's here.

1274
01:17:32,643 --> 01:17:35,438
- Girls- - Oh, my goodness.
She's upstairs with the choir.

1275
01:17:41,194 --> 01:17:42,612
- Deloris.
- Hi.

1276
01:17:42,695 --> 01:17:45,448
Look, Vince knows you're here.
We gotta get out now.

1277
01:17:45,532 --> 01:17:47,450
Oh, but I can't go. We're-We're
singing for the Pope tomorrow.

1278
01:17:47,534 --> 01:17:50,954
Listen, you're gonna be singing for St. Peter
if you don't get your ass outta here now.

1279
01:17:51,037 --> 01:17:53,122
But I- Oh -

1280
01:17:58,211 --> 01:17:59,962
I-I-I can't do this.
I can't leave.

1281
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:02,006
It's-It's-It's like
I'm deserting them.

1282
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,092
Hey, I think
they'll understand.

1283
01:18:04,175 --> 01:18:06,511
No, you don't understand.
They need me.

1284
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,888
They need you?
A bunch of nuns?

1285
01:18:08,971 --> 01:18:10,640
What for? Moral guidance?

1286
01:18:10,723 --> 01:18:12,642
What? Make-up tips?

1287
01:18:12,725 --> 01:18:15,394
Let me tell you something.
We are talking about the Pope.

1288
01:18:15,477 --> 01:18:19,982
This means a great deal to them, and they have
worked very hard for this, and they deserve it.

1289
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:23,069
Where you going?
Where are you going?

1290
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:26,029
I am going to the little
nun's room, nosy.

1291
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,012
There you are.
We've been looking for you.

1292
01:18:51,096 --> 01:18:53,265
- Shh, shh, shh. - Re-Rehearsal's about
to start. - Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

1293
01:18:53,349 --> 01:18:55,684
- Surprise.
- Guess who?

1294
01:18:55,768 --> 01:18:58,103
- Rehearsal's this way, Sisters.
- Hey, Deloris.

1295
01:18:58,187 --> 01:18:59,897
- Hi. - Come on. -
All right, all right.

1296
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,033
What do they want?
Who are they?

1297
01:19:12,117 --> 01:19:14,536
Reno scum. Come on, man!

1298
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:20,708
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

1299
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:33,638
Where are we going?

1300
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:36,098
Sister here has got
a special command performance.

1301
01:19:36,183 --> 01:19:37,850
Yeah, back
at the Moonlight Lounge.

1302
01:19:37,933 --> 01:19:39,518
Look, why don't you just
let her go, you know?

1303
01:19:39,603 --> 01:19:41,313
She doesn't have
anything to do with this.

1304
01:19:41,395 --> 01:19:43,774
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. So she can
run right to the cops, huh?

1305
01:19:43,856 --> 01:19:47,234
Look, you just go
with the flow, okay?

1306
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:49,738
Relax. You do what
I tell you to do.

1307
01:19:57,828 --> 01:20:01,415
- Go!
- Oh! Oh!

1308
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:03,751
- She's gettin' away.
- You don't even have to worry about her, okay?

1309
01:20:03,834 --> 01:20:07,088
- You got the one you came for.
- She's right. Let's go.

1310
01:20:08,506 --> 01:20:10,424
You all right?
It's okay, I'm a cop.

1311
01:20:10,508 --> 01:20:12,301
They've got Sister Mary
Clarence, and they've got guns.

1312
01:20:12,384 --> 01:20:13,928
- Where are they taking her?
- Um, they said the Moonlight Lounge.

1313
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:15,261
- Come on, get out of the street.
- Okay.

1314
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,111
- You mean they kidnapped her?
- Yes.

1315
01:20:31,195 --> 01:20:33,113
Two men, and they had guns.

1316
01:20:33,197 --> 01:20:35,032
Why would anyone kidnap a nun?

1317
01:20:35,115 --> 01:20:36,617
Were they Catholics?

1318
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:39,619
She isn't a nun.

1319
01:20:39,703 --> 01:20:43,373
She's a lounge singer. Her real
name is Deloris Van Cartier.

1320
01:20:43,457 --> 01:20:47,128
She witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent.

1321
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,462
- She isn't a nun?
- She-She lied to us?

1322
01:20:49,547 --> 01:20:51,297
But she was such
a wonderful nun.

1323
01:20:51,381 --> 01:20:54,384
Look what she did with the choir.
She made us sing beautifully.

1324
01:20:54,467 --> 01:20:57,972
- That should have tipped us.
- Well, I don't care who she is. We can't sing without her.

1325
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:00,140
- She's our inspiration.
- Right.

1326
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:03,101
Reverend Mother, please, I know
that you and Mary Clarence...

1327
01:21:03,184 --> 01:21:04,769
didn't always agree,
but we've got to help her.

1328
01:21:04,853 --> 01:21:06,521
- Please.
- We've gotta save her.

1329
01:21:06,604 --> 01:21:10,108
- We can't leave it up to the Feds.
- No, they'll -

1330
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:12,610
Calm down, calm down.

1331
01:21:12,694 --> 01:21:14,279
Mary Robert, think clearly.

1332
01:21:14,362 --> 01:21:16,114
Have you any idea
who these two men where?

1333
01:21:16,197 --> 01:21:21,035
Yes. They were from Reno, and they're
taking her to the Moonlight Lounge.

1334
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:24,456
Reno? Nevada.

1335
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:27,584
- Mary Emmanuel, tell the Monsignor the situation.
- Yes, Mother.

1336
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:29,961
- The rest of you, follow me.
- Yes, Mother.

1337
01:21:31,296 --> 01:21:32,797
It's 1,500 for the run to Reno.

1338
01:21:32,881 --> 01:21:34,631
That's 500 less
than I normally charge.

1339
01:21:34,716 --> 01:21:36,968
But-But we don't have $1,500.

1340
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,137
Well, then I can't fly you
there. I'm sorry.

1341
01:21:40,722 --> 01:21:43,348
Look, I-I'm sorry. I-I-I've got
things I have to check out here.

1342
01:21:43,433 --> 01:21:46,811
Father, do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need.

1343
01:21:46,894 --> 01:21:48,813
When he stands before You
on the day of judgment,

1344
01:21:48,896 --> 01:21:50,731
do not send him
straight to hell.

1345
01:21:50,815 --> 01:21:53,984
Please, please, do not treat him with
the same disregard that he's treated us.

1346
01:21:54,067 --> 01:21:55,986
Just because he can't
show charity to nuns,

1347
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:58,572
try not to leave him without
rewards when he asks for them.

1348
01:21:58,656 --> 01:22:00,991
We know it is easier to answer
the prayers of a man...

1349
01:22:01,075 --> 01:22:02,576
who has answered
the prayers of others,

1350
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,244
but if he should
come to You...

1351
01:22:04,328 --> 01:22:07,581
- For relief of pain or -
- Such as rheumatoid arthritis,

1352
01:22:07,664 --> 01:22:09,583
loss of hair, neck polyps.

1353
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:12,086
Don't leave him bald
and yowling in despair.

1354
01:22:12,169 --> 01:22:14,505
Watch over him as he refuses
to watch over us.

1355
01:22:14,588 --> 01:22:16,924
And if You cannot, we know that
You will have done Your level best.

1356
01:22:17,007 --> 01:22:20,094
- What goes around, comes around.
- Look, Sisters, Sisters -

1357
01:22:21,678 --> 01:22:23,388
Hold on a second.

1358
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:44,618
What did you think you were doing,
running to the cops, Deloris?

1359
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,829
Hiding out?
Big no-no, babe.

1360
01:22:47,913 --> 01:22:49,831
Bet you're sorry now.

1361
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:52,751
I'm sorry
for all my sins, Vince,

1362
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,378
and I'm sorry for yours.

1363
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,963
I loved you, Deloris.

1364
01:22:57,047 --> 01:22:59,132
I gave you everything:

1365
01:22:59,216 --> 01:23:02,427
my affection, my time,
a big-time career.

1366
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,472
And how do you repay me?
What's the thanks I get?

1367
01:23:05,555 --> 01:23:07,974
Where's the loyalty?

1368
01:23:08,057 --> 01:23:10,268
You shouldn't have
done that to me, babe.

1369
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:13,229
You'll be judged.
We all will.

1370
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,566
I don't get judged.

1371
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:19,777
Vince, she's been acting weird
since we picked her up.

1372
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:22,780
It's like, uh,
she's scared of nothin'.

1373
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,323
She's scared.

1374
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:26,784
Tell the boys
how scared you are.

1375
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:28,953
I forgive you, Vince.

1376
01:23:35,626 --> 01:23:37,294
Waste her.

1377
01:23:47,221 --> 01:23:49,474
It's beautiful.

1378
01:23:49,556 --> 01:23:52,642
And what a lovely name: Reno.

1379
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:54,811
And Gomorrah.

1380
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:57,647
No, she was this doll. She used to wear
this basket of fruit on her head and go -

1381
01:23:57,732 --> 01:23:59,816
Excuse me, Vince.

1382
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,902
- Yeah?
- We didn't do it.

1383
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:04,739
- It's done?
- Uh, not totally.

1384
01:24:06,406 --> 01:24:10,578
- What's the problem?
- Well, Vince, we can't waste a nun.

1385
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,247
What are you nuts
talking about?

1386
01:24:14,331 --> 01:24:16,917
It's Deloris,
in a costume.

1387
01:24:17,001 --> 01:24:19,586
Well, Vince, now how do you know
she didn't join up...

1388
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:21,755
and become a real nun
when she was there?

1389
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:23,298
Things like this happen.

1390
01:24:26,176 --> 01:24:29,930
Because I know this woman,
in the biblical sense,

1391
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:31,765
and she ain't no nun.

1392
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:33,767
Now I don't want
to hear any more of this.

1393
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,143
Go in there and do it.

1394
01:24:35,227 --> 01:24:36,937
Just don't come back
till it's over.

1395
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,105
- Okay.
- It's done.

1396
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,776
Okay, we go
one, two, three, shoot.

1397
01:24:42,859 --> 01:24:47,614
Wait. We don't go
one, two and shoot on three?

1398
01:24:47,697 --> 01:24:49,282
Get over there.

1399
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:57,874
One, two, three.

1400
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:02,044
- You didn't shoot.
- Neither did you.

1401
01:25:02,129 --> 01:25:04,380
I figured if, uh, you did,
I wouldn't have to.

1402
01:25:04,463 --> 01:25:06,382
That's what I figured.

1403
01:25:08,092 --> 01:25:09,718
Sisters, come on!

1404
01:25:14,765 --> 01:25:17,226
Deloris, we got it
all worked out.

1405
01:25:17,309 --> 01:25:18,727
- Hmm.
- Strip.

1406
01:25:18,812 --> 01:25:20,062
What?

1407
01:25:20,146 --> 01:25:21,730
Come on, come on.
Take off the, uh, nun thing.

1408
01:25:21,815 --> 01:25:23,649
Yeah, yeah.
The nun thing.

1409
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:25,025
What is she doing?

1410
01:25:25,109 --> 01:25:26,652
Oh, my God.
She's praying.

1411
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:30,823
Lord, I want you to forgive
Willy and Joey...

1412
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:34,243
because they know not
what they do.

1413
01:25:34,326 --> 01:25:36,871
They're only doing what
Vince told them to do...

1414
01:25:36,954 --> 01:25:39,914
because Vince is too chicken
to do it himself.

1415
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:43,918
So he's called upon these two men
to take care of his business.

1416
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:46,672
So I want you
to forgive them, Lord.

1417
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:50,259
Espectum, espertum,

1418
01:25:50,341 --> 01:25:55,931
cacoomb, tutu, eplubium.

1419
01:25:56,014 --> 01:25:57,766
- Amen. -
Amen. - Amen.

1420
01:25:59,851 --> 01:26:01,270
Ooh.

1421
01:26:04,981 --> 01:26:07,734
Hey! Get out of my way!

1422
01:26:07,818 --> 01:26:10,237
- Hey!
- Ow!

1423
01:26:13,323 --> 01:26:15,116
You all right?
You all right?

1424
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:35,595
- Go-Go find Vince.
- Right.

1425
01:26:39,181 --> 01:26:40,599
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, my goodness!

1426
01:26:40,683 --> 01:26:43,269
There it is!
The Moonlight Lounge! That's it!

1427
01:27:04,957 --> 01:27:06,708
Brace yourself, Sisters.

1428
01:27:06,793 --> 01:27:09,711
Just spread out
and look for Mary Clarence.

1429
01:27:09,795 --> 01:27:13,674
- Now, j- Try to blend in.
- Done.

1430
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,552
- Over here.
- Come with me, guys.

1431
01:27:16,635 --> 01:27:18,011
Over this way.

1432
01:27:20,473 --> 01:27:22,391
Hi. Excuse me.
Sorry.

1433
01:27:22,474 --> 01:27:24,560
Has anyone seen a nun?
A Carmelite nun?

1434
01:27:24,643 --> 01:27:26,562
- No? Sure? Okay, thanks.
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

1435
01:27:26,645 --> 01:27:28,230
She's not really a nun.
See, she's just posing as a nun.

1436
01:27:28,313 --> 01:27:30,065
It came as a great
shock to us.

1437
01:27:37,781 --> 01:27:40,701
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1438
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:44,079
- Place your bets.
- Red 23.

1439
01:27:44,163 --> 01:27:46,081
- You're sure? - Mm-hmm.
- How do you know?

1440
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:50,418
- Red 23. - Well,
us too. - Here.

1441
01:27:50,502 --> 01:27:53,589
- Works for me. - I'm on it.
- I'm in. I'm in. - All of it.

1442
01:27:55,924 --> 01:27:57,383
Red 14.

1443
01:27:58,886 --> 01:28:01,220
I was just trying
to teach you all a lesson.

1444
01:28:03,182 --> 01:28:05,349
Oh! Excuse me!

1445
01:28:05,434 --> 01:28:07,560
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

1446
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:10,898
Ah!

1447
01:28:13,317 --> 01:28:15,193
Sister Mary Ignatius!

1448
01:28:15,277 --> 01:28:16,694
follow me.

1449
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:29,416
Block off the street, but don't
move in until I tell you.

1450
01:28:29,499 --> 01:28:30,750
Okay.

1451
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:33,044
Nine! Pay the filed. Nine.

1452
01:28:33,128 --> 01:28:35,630
Pay the filed.

1453
01:28:35,713 --> 01:28:38,424
- Add the point -
- Come on. Stay with the others.

1454
01:28:38,508 --> 01:28:40,426
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we're saving you. Move!

1455
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:45,264
- Move! - Mary Clarence,
you're safe. - What in the -

1456
01:28:45,348 --> 01:28:48,434
Come on! Move! Move!

1457
01:28:48,517 --> 01:28:52,688
- Break! Now! Break!
- Oh. - Hey, nuns.

1458
01:28:52,772 --> 01:28:55,274
- Joey!
- Vinny, Vinny, there's a thousand nuns here!

1459
01:28:55,357 --> 01:28:57,443
- What do we do?
- You go to the left.

1460
01:28:57,526 --> 01:28:59,653
- You go to the right. I'm gonna go down the middle.
- All right.

1461
01:29:02,824 --> 01:29:05,284
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

1462
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:14,544
Five black. Five.

1463
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:23,927
Hey, babe.

1464
01:29:25,972 --> 01:29:27,639
Yes, sweetheart?

1465
01:29:30,142 --> 01:29:33,895
No more bets. No more bets.
Fifteen black.

1466
01:29:33,979 --> 01:29:36,940
- Seal off the exits and get ready to move in.
- Roger.

1467
01:29:38,817 --> 01:29:41,069
There's another way out.
Let's go. Come.

1468
01:29:41,153 --> 01:29:42,571
Excuse us.

1469
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,625
Come on. Out.

1470
01:30:02,339 --> 01:30:04,175
- Move in now.
- Yes, sir.

1471
01:30:06,845 --> 01:30:09,264
- Hey, uh, I can't see a thing.
- Willy, hit the lights.

1472
01:30:13,518 --> 01:30:15,687
Freeze!

1473
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:17,271
Everybody!

1474
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:20,733
Joey.

1475
01:30:20,817 --> 01:30:24,780
- Wh-Wh-Where is she?
- I'm right here.

1476
01:30:24,862 --> 01:30:26,280
I'm here.

1477
01:30:26,364 --> 01:30:28,282
Leave them alone. They don't
have anything to do with it.

1478
01:30:28,366 --> 01:30:31,118
Just- I'm here.

1479
01:30:34,538 --> 01:30:36,874
Calm down.

1480
01:30:46,884 --> 01:30:48,803
Joey, do it.

1481
01:30:48,885 --> 01:30:51,472
I can't, Vince.

1482
01:30:51,555 --> 01:30:53,974
She's still a nun.

1483
01:30:54,058 --> 01:30:55,643
She's a broad.

1484
01:30:55,725 --> 01:30:57,812
You got it?
Just a broad.

1485
01:30:57,895 --> 01:31:00,021
I guarantee you
she is no broad.

1486
01:31:00,106 --> 01:31:02,565
She is Sister Mary Clarence
of St. Katherine's Convent.

1487
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:05,735
She's a model of generosity,
virtue and love.

1488
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,531
You have my word for it,
gentlemen. She is a nun.

1489
01:31:09,323 --> 01:31:10,908
You hear that?

1490
01:31:10,990 --> 01:31:14,078
Now, aren't you glad
we didn't shoot her?

1491
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,293
- Don't shoot! - Drop it. - Okay,
okay, okay. - Right there! Let's go!

1492
01:31:22,377 --> 01:31:24,922
- The gun's down, the gun's down. - Drop
your weapon! - All right, drop it! - Okay.

1493
01:31:25,004 --> 01:31:27,257
- Lay it down right there! -
You all right? - Turn around.

1494
01:31:27,341 --> 01:31:29,801
You okay? Oh, God.

1495
01:31:33,012 --> 01:31:36,433
- I'm shot! Watch the arm!
- Are you okay?

1496
01:31:36,516 --> 01:31:38,435
- Take it easy on me.
- Come on. - Sorry.

1497
01:31:38,518 --> 01:31:41,604
- Things got kind of out of hand.
- Oh, just "kind of out of hand"?

1498
01:31:41,688 --> 01:31:44,941
Boy, am I glad you're a much better
shot than you are a protector.

1499
01:31:46,192 --> 01:31:49,738
But thank you.

1500
01:31:49,821 --> 01:31:52,115
- All right, come on.
- I was good to you!

1501
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:54,367
- All right.
- We had a great thing! You sang in the hotel!

1502
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:55,952
- Come on.
- Badly!

1503
01:31:56,035 --> 01:31:58,163
- In there.
- How could you betray me like this?

1504
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:01,750
- You are nothing! - Get him
out of here. - Right, Lieutenant.

1505
01:32:01,832 --> 01:32:05,003
- I got two words for you, Vince.
- Mary Clarence.

1506
01:32:06,962 --> 01:32:08,964
Bless you.

1507
01:32:09,798 --> 01:32:11,091
- Just go.
- Come on.

1508
01:32:11,176 --> 01:32:13,428
- Oh! Hey!
- We got another -

1509
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:15,889
I hold you responsible
for all of this.

1510
01:32:15,971 --> 01:32:18,265
For introducing a lounge act
into my convent.

1511
01:32:18,348 --> 01:32:20,267
For utterly disrupting our lives...

1512
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:23,103
and exposing us all
to mortal danger.

1513
01:32:25,023 --> 01:32:26,316
Thank you.

1514
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,196
No, no, thank you.

1515
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,990
Thank you all.

1516
01:32:35,532 --> 01:32:37,618
I'm really
gonna miss you guys.

1517
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:40,746
We thought you were
a nun, Deloris.

1518
01:32:40,829 --> 01:32:43,999
- Yeah.
- Van Cartier.

1519
01:32:48,045 --> 01:32:50,963
Sisters, we have
a concert to do.

1520
01:32:51,048 --> 01:32:53,092
I thought you were leaving.

1521
01:32:53,175 --> 01:32:55,636
We can't both of us leave.

1522
01:33:13,153 --> 01:33:18,241
I will follow Him

1523
01:33:19,492 --> 01:33:21,911
follow Him wherever

1524
01:33:21,995 --> 01:33:26,417
He may go

1525
01:33:28,167 --> 01:33:33,257
And near Him
I always will be

1526
01:33:34,507 --> 01:33:39,762
or nothing
can keep me away

1527
01:33:39,846 --> 01:33:45,309
He is my destiny

1528
01:33:47,186 --> 01:33:52,942
I will follow Him

1529
01:33:53,025 --> 01:33:56,778
Ever since
He touched my heart

1530
01:33:56,863 --> 01:34:01,325
I knew

1531
01:34:01,409 --> 01:34:06,581
There isn't an ocean too deep

1532
01:34:07,832 --> 01:34:12,878
A mountain so high
it can keep

1533
01:34:12,962 --> 01:34:18,759
Keep me away

1534
01:34:21,345 --> 01:34:24,431

wherever He may go

1541
01:34:54,045 --> 01:34:57,589

- There isn't an ocean too deep
- Too deep

1547
01:35:13,814 --> 01:35:16,233
A mountain so high

Keep us away

1549
01:35:19,486 --> 01:35:22,239
Away from His love

1550
01:35:22,322 --> 01:35:24,741

A mountain so high
it can keep

1560
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:58,607
- Nothing can keep me away
- Keep us away

1561
01:35:58,691 --> 01:36:04,363
Away from His love

1562
01:36:35,853 --> 01:36:36,978
