Storm clouds.
On the horizon, sir.

42
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,498
Heading straight
for Cherry Tree Lane.

Jane!

00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:14,945
What is it, Ellen?

48
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,280
The bloody sink's exploded!

49
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:18,883
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, not again!

50
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,518
Annabel! John!

51
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,520
We heard, Aunt Jane!
I'll ring the plumbers!

52
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,821
I'll turn off the water
at the mains.

53
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,523
Yes, thank you,
darlings.

54
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:27,024
Um, Ellen, fetch us
a mop and towels, will you?

55
00:07:27,025 --> 00:07:29,293
I told him
to get them pipes fixed.

56
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:32,030
Been here
since the Romans ruled.

57
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,497
What's happening?

58
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:34,799
Don't go
in the kitchen, Georgie.

59
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,434
Not without your wellies.

60
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,435
Oh, uh, yes. Hello.
We've had a burst pipe.

61
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:39,669
<i>Just one moment, please.</i>

62
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,404
Excuse me. Ellen!

63
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,774
Can you please get the door?
I've got the plumbers here.

64
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,508
That was quick work,
wasn't it?

65
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,645
- Here, Georgie. Take them.
- 17 Cherry Tree Lane.

66
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,345
<i>By the park?</i>

67
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:51,816
Yes, I'm coming! Blimey.

68
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,584
Ah! Good morning, mum.

69
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:55,553
They don't look
much like plumbers to me.

70
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:56,854
I meant on the phone.

71
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:58,389
We are not plumbers,
we are lawyers.

72
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,824
Lawyers?

73
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,859
And here's me
hoping you might prove useful.

74
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,396
Water's off!

75
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,831
And the plumbers
are on their way.

76
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,699
Well done, everybody.
Phew! Such excitement.

77
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,601
What are you doing here,
Aunt Jane?

78
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:12,603
We're handing out
breakfast at the union hall.

79
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,338
I snuck away
for a morning hug.

80
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,640
Come here, Georgie.

81
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,677
Will you stop that banging?

82
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,613
Barely eight o'clock
on a Sunday morning!

83
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:25,916
What you doing with my mop?

84
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:27,785
Forgive the intrusion, mum.

85
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:29,820
Our current workload prevents
us from taking weekends off.

86
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,321
We would like
to have a word

87
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:32,757
with Mr. Banks,
if he is available.

88
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:34,493
"Notice of Repossession"?

89
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:36,861
Wait there.

90
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:37,995
Goodness. I'll be cleaning up
that mess all morning.

91
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,063
Here, let me take
that for you.

92
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:40,364
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

93
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,432
Excuse me, sir.

94
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,967
The wolves are at the door.

95
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:44,502
What do they want?

96
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,570
Well, a good thrashing,
if you ask me.

97
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,739
Oh, it's like
the River Thames in there!

98
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,108
Don't worry, Ellen.
I'll clean up.

99
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,742
Why don't you see
to the breakfast?

100
00:08:51,743 --> 00:08:53,111
Well, yes, somebody's got to,
haven't they?

101
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:55,880
Unless we all wanna starve.

102
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,581
Why don't you let
Ellen clean up?

103
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:59,450
I'm afraid, lately,
that means more work for me.

104
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,718
The other day,
I found a butcher's sack

105
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,419
hanging on the coat rack...

106
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,989
- and my hat was in the larder.
- Oh, dear.

107
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,489
- Can we go to the park?
- No, Georgie.

108
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,659
Ah! I need a brush!
I look a fright.

109
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,895
- Michael, don't forget you've got guests at the door.
- Oh, right.

110
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,529
- Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

111
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,097
We're struggling through a bit
of chaos this morning.

112
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,899
- Please.
- So it seems.

113
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,868
Unfortunately, Mr. Banks,
our business cannot wait.

114
00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:19,670
- Excuse me, sir.
- Today, we were...

115
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:21,071
How exactly am I
supposed to make breakfast

116
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:22,506
when there's nothing
in the larder...

117
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,008
but pickled herrings
and marmalade?

118
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,478
The groceries.
I meant to go yesterday.

119
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:30,014
Very well.
Pickled herrings for breakfast

120
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,816
and marmalade for lunch.

121
00:09:31,817 --> 00:09:33,884
There's a shop across the
park, will be open.

122
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,987
- The three of us can go.
- Thank you, John.

123
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:37,889
But you said we would go
to the park today!

124
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,957
We can cut through
the park on the way.

125
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,926
But...

126
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,459
- Enough, Georgie, come along.
- I'll take that, Father.

127
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,095
Oh, thank you.
Uh, please come through.

128
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:45,430
Uh...

129
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:49,634
Now, what is it
that I can do for you?

130
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:52,103
I am Hamilton Gooding.
This is Mr. Templeton Frye.

131
00:09:52,104 --> 00:09:55,073
We are solicitors with
the law firm of Gordy, Cordry,

132
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,942
Gooding and Frye.

133
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,076
What?

134
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,945
No. Sorry, nothing.

135
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:01,612
"Spruce"?

136
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,814
Is that your garden club?

137
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:06,884
No, it's the Society for
the Protection of the Rights

138
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:08,652
of the Underpaid Citizens
of England.

139
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,855
A labor organizer.

140
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:12,723
She's a labor organizer.

141
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:13,992
Yes.

142
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,027
Yes, but we also run
soup kitchens.

143
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:18,429
It's a never-ending job
these days, I'm afraid.

144
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,065
I'm sure it is, Mrs. Banks.

145
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,566
Miss Banks, actually.
I'm Michael's sister.

146
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,135
My wife passed away
this last year.

147
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,905
That's awful.
Those poor children.

148
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,140
Yes. Our deepest condolences.

149
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:30,775
Thank you. Forgive me,

150
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,143
what brings the two of you
here this morning?

151
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,545
I'm going to say my goodbyes.
I'm late for work.

152
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:34,813
Mr. Banks,
you took out a loan

153
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,081
with the
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank...

154
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,516
last year against the value
of your home.

155
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:39,784
You did what? Michael.

156
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:41,820
I had to, Jane.

157
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,189
With Kate and the bills piling
up, I really had no choice.

158
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,691
It's hard enough
these days, isn't it?

159
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,560
Yes. Well... Shh!

160
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:49,894
It seems you have fallen

161
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:52,463
three months behind
in your payments.

162
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:53,999
Oh.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,733
I'm so sorry.

164
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,736
Uh, Kate, my wife, used to
look after our finances.

165
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:01,239
And I've been a bit
off stride. Forgive me.

166
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,674
How much is it
that I owe you, exactly?

167
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:06,144
Unfortunately,
the bank is now demanding

168
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:09,547
that you pay back
the entire loan in full.

169
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,717
The entire loan?

170
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:14,185
Yes. It's all in the contract.

171
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,787
That's more than I make in
a year. I couldn't possibly.

172
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:17,255
Oh, dear.

173
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,224
You have five days.

174
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,192
If you are unable
to pay in full

175
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:22,928
by Friday at midnight...

176
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:25,030
I'm afraid we will have
to repossess your home...

177
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,999
and you will have to vacate
the premises.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,036
But I work
for Fidelity Fiduciary.

179
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,771
Not as an accountant,
I presume.

180
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,506
No, as a teller.

181
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:35,707
I took a part-time position
there this past year.

182
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,707
You see,
I'm really an artist.

183
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,209
Yes, be that as it may.

184
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,545
But my father, George Banks,
was a senior partner there.

185
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:42,914
Father left us shares
in the bank.

186
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,581
You could use those
to pay off the loan.

187
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:45,850
I was saving those
for the children.

188
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,119
Shares? In the bank?

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,922
Well, that does change things,
doesn't it?

190
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,958
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

191
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,859
Ready and charged, sir.

192
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,594
Do you have
the share certificate?

193
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:58,263
- I'm sorry, the what?
- The document...

194
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,266
The document proving
you own shares in the bank.

195
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,168
I suppose it must be somewhere
among Father's old papers.

196
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,303
Yes, I suppose it must.

197
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:05,704
Three...

198
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,706
two...

199
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,606
one!

200
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:09,742
Fire!

201
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:13,980
Good heavens!

202
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,685
Are you housing anarchists?

203
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:23,155
No, that's the Admiral,
next door.

204
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,990
He fires off a cannon
to mark the hour.

205
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,860
He's over five minutes late.

206
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:30,295
Yes. I'm afraid
he's been running

207
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,297
a little behind
these last few years.

208
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:34,566
As are we, this morning.

209
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,901
You've been given notice.

210
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:40,339
We'll see ourselves out.
Come along, Mr. Frye.

211
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,807
I do hope you find that share
certificate. I really do.

212
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:46,745
Good day to you both!

213
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:49,116
You really have chosen the
wrong profession, you know.

214
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:56,721
Why didn't you tell me
you'd taken out a loan?

215
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:58,991
I didn't want
to worry you.

216
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,060
Or the children.

217
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,727
I kept thinking
I would catch up.

218
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:04,830
Kate always managed.

219
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:08,067
Of all
the thick-headed mistakes.

220
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,970
I can't lose our home, Jane.
She's everywhere, here.

221
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,338
Well, then, we're not
going to let that happen.

222
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,640
But, Michael, you know we
neither of us have any money,

223
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,275
so we just have to find
that share certificate.

224
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,077
Do you have any idea where
Father might have kept it?

225
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,346
I don't know.

226
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:22,147
- In the attic, perhaps?
- Yes.

227
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,282
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to bring you into all of this.

228
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:24,716
Michael!

229
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:26,151
Michael!

230
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,986
This is our family home,
and you're about to lose it.

231
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,789
So please stop pretending
everything's fine. You need...

232
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,159
Are we going to lose our home?

233
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,793
- No. No, no, no.
- No, no. I...

234
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,362
Aunt Jane was only...

235
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,330
I was just saying
you won't have to worry,

236
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,665
because your father
owns shares in the bank.

237
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,236
But you said we don't have
enough money.

238
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:45,938
Well, I can make more money.

239
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:48,908
I am a banker now, aren't I?
That's what bankers do.

240
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,676
Make money.

241
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:53,045
But you're not a banker.
You're a painter.

242
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,881
Yes, well,
painters don't make money.

243
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:58,217
Not these days. Here, you see.

244
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,286
The day has hardly begun,

245
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,854
and I have already made you
10 pounds!

246
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,956
We'd best be going.

247
00:14:04,957 --> 00:14:07,892
Yes, yes, let's get
your hats on, shall we?

248
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:09,994
One moment, John.

249
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,763
Georgie shouldn't have to
spend his 10 pounds

250
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:12,997
on the shopping, should he?

251
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:14,799
Here you are.

252
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,702
Thank you, Father.

253
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,973
Ah! Off to the park, I see.

254
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:22,808
- Yes, that's right, Ellen.
- That's nice.

255
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:23,943
Shall we search
the attic, then?

256
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:25,010
Don't you have to go to work?

257
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,712
No. Work can wait.

258
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:27,980
Oh, thank you, Jane.

259
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,281
Well, why don't I check
the attic

260
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:31,183
and you check Father's
old wardrobe?

261
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,718
- Yes.
- We'll make lunch when we get home, Ellen.

262
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:35,187
- Gillie stays here.
- Aw!

263
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:38,925
Blimey, what little
grown-ups you've become.

264
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:43,863
Father didn't give us
enough, did he?

265
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:45,698
Not nearly.

266
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,234
Well, we can ask for
day-old bread at half off.

267
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,100
That's what Mother
used to do.

268
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,735
Hello, Willoughby!

269
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,071
Hello, Miss Lark!

270
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:54,173
- Hello, Georgie. Twins.
- Oh!

271
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:55,840
Good boy, Willoughby.

272
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,709
Come on, Georgie, we haven't
got enough time for this.

273
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,278
- Aw.
- Come along. Come on, Wil.

274
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,180
The balloon lady!
Can we get balloons?

275
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:04,016
No, Georgie! We haven't enough
for groceries as it is.

276
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,086
Oi! Georgie Banks!
Keep off the grass.

277
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,054
I don't spend all day
caring for it

278
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,389
just to see my work
get trampled on.

279
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,724
Go on, off it!

280
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:12,992
Sorry.

281
00:15:12,993 --> 00:15:15,794
What if Father
does lose the house?

282
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:17,096
We'll just have to
figure out a way

283
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,465
to get it back, I suppose.

284
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:21,101
You're right.
That's what Mother would do.

285
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:28,842
No.

Oh, my goodness.

321
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:23,451
Yes, it's quite a mess.

322
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,986
Yes, it is.

323
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:29,522
What are all your art things
doing up here?

324
00:18:29,523 --> 00:18:33,627
Oh. I wasn't
using them anymore.

325
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,364
I should probably just
get rid of it all.

326
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,601
Have you looked
in Father's old desk?

327
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:42,035
I honestly
can't remember why we kept

328
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,671
most of this stuff
to begin with.

329
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:47,107
I mean, why on earth did we
save this old broken thing?

330
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:50,042
Don't you remember that kite?

331
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:53,646
We used to love flying that
with Mother and Father.

332
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,549
Well, it won't fly anymore.

333
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,651
Out it goes.

334
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,354

Naughty boy.

339
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:15,597
Hush.

340
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,205
How long do you think
it will take us today?

341
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:28,441
Well, let's see. It's a
9-minute walk to the shop.

342
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,310
So if it takes 10 minutes...

343
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,478
to purchase each item...

344
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,713
Excuse me, children,
coming through!

345
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,280
Georgie! Come back!

346
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:36,082
- Georgie!
- You two!

347
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,519
I've told you before,
off the grass!

348
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,320
- But our brother!
- You heard me!

349
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,623
Now! What?

350
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,826
Whoa! Oh!

351
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,528
Help!

352
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,296
We're coming, Georgie!

353
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:23,298
Help!

354
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:26,534
Help!

355
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,336
- Hold on!
- Help me!

356
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,262
As I live and breathe.

357
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:11,812
You need to be more careful
when the wind rises, Georgie.

358
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,347
You nearly lost your kite.

359
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,583
And you two
nearly lost your Georgie.

360
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,884
He might have
got away completely

361
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,319
had I not been holding on

362
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,753
to the other end
of that string.

363
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:21,488
My goodness, Annabel...

364
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:23,591
what have you done
to your clothes?

365
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,159
You could grow a garden
in that much soil.

366
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,427
And, John...

367
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,195
yes, just as filthy.

368
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,831
How do you know our names?

369
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:32,299
Because she's Mary Poppins,
of course.

370
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,703
May I say, you look lovely,
as always.

371
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:36,303
Do you really think so?

372
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,672
Nice to see you, Jack.

373
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,874
Good to see you too,
Mary Poppins.

374
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,477
I was just your age
when we first met,

375
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:43,912
working for a chimney sweep.

376
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,513
How is dear old Bert?

377
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,582
Traveling the world, he is.
Off to points unknown.

378
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,882
Well, now I am off to speak

379
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:50,651
with the father
of these children.

380
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,753
This family is clearly
in desperate need of a nanny.

381
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,321
Now, quick march
and best foot forward,

382
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,191
and I'll thank you
not to dawdle.

383
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:01,830
Go on!

384
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:09,838
Father! Aunt Jane! Come quick!

385
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,338
- Quickly!
- What is it, Georgie?

386
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:12,941
Has something happened?

387
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:16,544
I was flying a kite
and it got caught on a nanny!

388
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,312
Whatever are you
talking about?

389
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,781
Come! Come, look!

390
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:21,783
Wait, where did you get
that kite?

391
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,785
I found it in the park.

392
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:26,255
She kept it from blowing away.

393
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:30,926
- Mary...
- Poppins.

394
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,828
Oh, close your mouth
please, Michael.

395
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,364
We are still not a codfish.

396
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:40,602
Jane Banks, still rather
inclined to giggle, I see.

397
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,706
Good heavens,
it really is you.

398
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,408
You seem hardly
to have aged at all.

399
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,444
Really!
How incredibly rude.

400
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:52,647
One never discusses
a woman's age, Michael.

401
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,381
I would have hoped
I taught you better.

402
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:57,317
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- You came back.

403
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,621
I thought
we'd never see you again.

404
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:01,424
It is wonderful to see you.

405
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:03,959
Yes, it is, isn't it?

406
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,429
So, you know her, then?

407
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,397
Mary Poppins
used to be our nanny.

408
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:12,500
What brings you here
after all this time?

409
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:13,935
Same thing that
brought me the first time.

410
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,437
I've come to look after
the Banks children.

411
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:17,439
- Us?
- Oh, yes, you too.

412
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,908
But we don't need a nanny.

413
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,675
Mother taught us
to look after ourselves.

414
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,677
You did just misplace Georgie,
I might point out.

415
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,379
Only slightly.
We got him back.

416
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,815
We can do anything
a nanny can.

417
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:28,717
Mary Poppins
flew here on a kite.

418
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,551
You can't do that, can you?

419
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,020
What are you talking about,
Georgie? Don't be silly.

420
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,722
Oh, let him believe
what he likes.

421
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,657
When your father and I were
young, we used to imagine...

422
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:38,693
that Mary Poppins could do all
sorts of impossible things.

423
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,462
Actually...

424
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,529
"Actually," what?

425
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,630
Actually, I'd like to get back

426
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:43,665
to the matter
of my employment.

427
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,333
Your umbrella talks!

428
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:46,801
Georgie, please,

429
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:48,403
we're in the midst
of a grown-up conversation.

430
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,704
Why don't we go
upstairs, Georgie?

431
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,006
But it did talk! I promise!

432
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,541
I'm afraid Georgie sometimes

433
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,510
suffers from an excess
of imagination.

434
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,378
As I recall,

435
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,914
you had the same affliction
yourself when you were young.

436
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,916
Did I, really? Well,
those days are long behind me.

437
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,318
Are they, indeed? Hmm.

438
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,087
- Now, about my employment...
- Yes, about your employment...

439
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:06,621
the truth is,
I simply can't afford...

440
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,023
We can settle on terms later,

441
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:09,491
although I will want
my old room back.

442
00:25:09,492 --> 00:25:11,392
That's if it's not
a complete disaster...

443
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,393
and I will insist on having
every second Tuesday off.

444
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,730
- No, I'm afraid, I...
- Of course, Mary Poppins.

445
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,031
Good, good.
That's all settled.

446
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:19,834
Then I'll stay.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

447
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,503
the children have turned
themselves into dustbins.

448
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:22,937
So the first order of business

449
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,774
is to see them properly
bathed and dressed.

450
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,043
Jane, have you gone
completely mad?

451
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,779
I can't afford to take
on anyone else.

452
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,913
Mary Poppins
isn't just anyone.

453
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,014
Don't you see, Michael?

454
00:25:33,015 --> 00:25:34,516
No one's
hiring nannies anymore.

455
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:36,651
The poor woman
has nowhere to go.

456
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:37,987
- Well, neither will we by the end of the week!
- Oh, don't be so grumpy.

457
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:39,021
- You sound just like Father.
- I do not!

458
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:40,455
Give Mary Poppins a chance.

459
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,057
You need help
just as much as she does!

460
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:45,460
Very well. She can stay
for the time being, I suppose.

461
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,031
After all, she did fly
all this way on a kite.

462
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:55,738
Those things, when we were
young, they didn't really...

463
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:56,872
- Happen?
- No.

464
00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:58,107
- No.
- Of course not.

465
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,908
Ridiculous.

466
00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:04,746
Oh, hello, Mary Poppins.

467
00:26:04,747 --> 00:26:06,482
Hello, Ellen.

468
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:13,088
How'd you do that?

469
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,756
Do what?

470
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:16,691
And why didn't Father believe
you flew here on a kite?

471
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,760
Because it's complete
nonsense, of course.

472
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:20,896
Grown-ups forget.
They always do.

473
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:22,630
That will be
quite enough of that.

474
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,767
I should have left you
in the umbrella stand.

475
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:26,634
- Not with the canes!
- Oh.

476
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:30,172
What are you two
whispering about?

477
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:31,740
Nothing.

478
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:34,076
"Nothing." Such a
useful word, isn't it?

479
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:36,512
It can mean anything
and everything.

480
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:37,913
It's just that...

481
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,181
You don't require
the services of a nanny.

482
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,683
Well, we have grown up
a good deal

483
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,052
in the past year,
after all.

484
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,119
Yes.

485
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,755
Well, we'll have to see
what can be done about that.

486
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:48,489
That was
our mother's, be careful.

487
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,626
I am always careful.

488
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,162
So, you're staying?

489
00:26:53,163 --> 00:26:56,464
Yes, I'll stay.
Until the door opens.

490
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:57,732
What does that mean?

491
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,434
That door's always opening.

492
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:01,536
Oh, not that door,
another one.

493
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,205
The bathroom door?

494
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,407
That's just silly, Georgie.

495
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:08,944
- Not the bathroom door?
- No.

496
00:27:08,945 --> 00:27:10,746
But a bath would prove useful.

497
00:27:10,747 --> 00:27:13,482
Come along.
Time for a good, clean start.

498
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,588
Mother always had us
take our baths in the evening.

499
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,056
Well, in my experience,
Annabel...

500
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,825
the perfect time of day
to have a bath

501
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,059
is when one needs a wash.

502
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,662
Georgie, you will go first.

503
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:28,998
We are perfectly capable
of drawing our own baths.

504
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:30,532
How very helpful, John.

505
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,635
In that case,
you may turn off the tap.

506
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,737
But not quite yet, still need
to put in the bubbles.

507
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,505
But I don't like
soap bubbles.

508
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:38,706
Well, then
you shall have to try

509
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,743
to avoid them at all costs.

510
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,746
She's a tough nut,
isn't she?

511
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:46,547
All right then...

512
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:48,217
but we'll have to
get this done quickly!

513
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,953
Right, we still have to
get down to the grocers...

514
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:52,721
and it looks as though
it might rain.

515
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:54,790
I know who you should ask.

516
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,058
Her umbrella can't talk,
Georgie.

517
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:57,226
The very idea.

518
00:27:57,227 --> 00:27:59,061
How do you know it can't?

519
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:00,829
Because it can't.
The very notion is ridiculous.

520
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,698
Exactly right, Annabel.
It's nonsense.

521
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,066
Foolishness.

00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,701
It makes no sense.

523
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:07,836

On second thoughts,
perhaps you're right.

549
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:34,890
It makes no sense to take
a bath this early.

550
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:37,227
Wait! I want to take a bath!

551
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:38,928
Oh, really?

552
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:41,797

What happened?
Will they be all right?

559
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:53,109
Well, it is just a bath,
after all.

560
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,344
But then again,
it's not my tub.

561
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:55,879
Shouldn't you go in

562
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,014
Oh, no, I had my bath

No, nothing.

Well, then that's it,
it's not here.

605
00:33:22,454 --> 00:33:24,220
Father, Aunt Jane!

606
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:26,490

Not now, please.

610
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,830
But it really happened!
Tell him, Mary Poppins!

611
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,898
I have no idea
what you're all talking about.

612
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,268

a pirate ship!

Enough, please!

614
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,843
You're right, Father.
We're sorry.

615
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:50,047
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

616
00:33:50,048 --> 00:33:52,549
I don't mean to be cross
with all of you. I...

617
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,886
I've just lost something
very important.

618
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:57,288
Yes. And we're
going to find it.

619
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,922
I'm sure your grandfather just

620
00:33:58,923 --> 00:34:00,424
tucked it away somewhere
for safekeeping.

621
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:02,191
The bank!

622
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,960
Didn't Father have a safety
deposit box in the bank?

623
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,194
Yes. Yes, he did.

624
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,563
- Well, let's go.
- It's closed.

625
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:07,631
We'll go first thing
in the morning.

626
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:09,098
But won't we need a key?

627
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,167
There's a whole drawer
full of keys

628
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,468
in Father's old desk upstairs.

629
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,902
- Is there?
- Yes!

630
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:15,905
My goodness, gracious,
glory me.

631
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,274
You'd think by now
they'd have learned

632
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:19,210
to pick up after themselves.

633
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:39,196
Cleaning is not a spectator
sport, I'll remind you.

634
00:34:39,197 --> 00:34:40,264
John, Annabel,
put all the books

635
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:41,466
back on the bookshelves.

636
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,469
Georgie Banks,
come back here.

637
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:46,103
Take out this rubbish,
would you?

638
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:47,271
Yes, Mary Poppins.

639
00:34:47,272 --> 00:34:48,872
There's a good boy.

640
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:53,010
Off you go, spit spot.

641
00:35:27,713 --> 00:35:29,047
Oh, well.

642
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:31,350
That's that.

643
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:35,552
What about Mr. Dawes, Jr.?

644
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:38,288
Couldn't he give you
more time?

645
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:40,257
Yes, I'm sure he could
if he were still here...

646
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:44,094
but Dawes' nephew has been
running things lately.

647
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:46,296
I don't think he even knows
who I am.

648
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:48,132
- Thank you.
- Very good, sir.

649
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:50,669
Well, it's high time he found
out, don't you think?

650
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:53,639
Jane?

651
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:55,740
Jane!

652
00:36:03,716 --> 00:36:05,116
Jane!

653
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:07,118
Jane!

654
00:36:08,654 --> 00:36:10,189
- Banks.
- Good morning.

655
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,558
Sorry.

656
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:18,163
Jane. We can't just charge
into his office.

657
00:36:18,164 --> 00:36:21,566
Hello, Miss Penny Farthing,
is it?

658
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,468
Heavens, did the old secretary
finally retire?

659
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:26,670
She always had
that big jar of sweets

660
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:28,172
on the desk
we'd raid as children.

661
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:30,607
I remember that jar.

662
00:36:30,608 --> 00:36:34,278
Those little toffees that
stuck your teeth together.

663
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,413
Must get you one of
those jars, Miss Farthing.

664
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:38,415
Of course, sir.

665
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,385
This wouldn't happen to be your
sister, would it, Mr. Banks?

666
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:42,219
- Yes.
- Yes, Jane Banks.

667
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,721
How do you do?

668
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:45,590
Great pleasure to meet you.
William Weatherall Wilkins.

669
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:47,426
Do step this way.

670
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,733
If I had known

671
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:58,136
that George Banks' son
had taken a loan with us...

672
00:36:58,137 --> 00:37:00,405
I would have handled
the paperwork myself.

673
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:02,540
Unfortunately...

674
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:04,142
regarding an extension,

675
00:37:04,143 --> 00:37:06,211
there's very little I can do
at this point.

676
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,512
I see.

677
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,748
Our father did leave us
shares in the bank.

678
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:12,416
Oh, well,
that is good news!

679
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,551
Yes. Yes, it is.

680
00:37:13,552 --> 00:37:15,185
But the trouble is,

681
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:16,521
we can't seem to find
the share certificate.

682
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:17,755
You wouldn't happen
to have any record

683
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:19,223
of Father's shares,
would you?

684
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:21,058
I would think so.

685
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,192
Bring in
the shareholder's ledger,

686
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:23,260
would you, Miss Farthing?

687
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,396
<i>Right away, Mr. Wilkins.</i>

688
00:37:25,397 --> 00:37:28,199
And what about your uncle,
Mr. Dawes, Jr.?

689
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,703
He'd know if Father received
shares, wouldn't he?

690
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:34,105
I'm afraid

691
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:36,808
dear old Uncle Dawes
is getting on in years.

692
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,177
<i>Non compos mentis...</i>

693
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:41,513
Which, sadly, is why
I had to take over for him.

694
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:43,115
Ah, thank you, Miss Farthing.

695
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,151
Let's see.

696
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,086
"Babcock...

00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,355
"Baker..."

698
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,861
Hmm.

699
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:59,031
Doesn't seem to be a listing
for George Banks here.

700
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:02,734
Don't despair.

701
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:05,403
You still have until
that big fellow out there

702
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:06,671
chimes his last
on Friday night...

703
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:07,872
to find that certificate.

704
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:10,308
And I'll keep looking here
as well.

705
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,644
Yes, well, thank you
so very much, Mr. Wilkins.

706
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:15,146
It's really been
a great pleasure. Thank you.

707
00:38:15,147 --> 00:38:16,614
Very kind of you.
Thank you, Mr. Wilkins.

708
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:17,783
Not at all.

709
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:29,160
Bring in all of George Banks'
old files, would you?

710
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:31,130
<i>Of course, Mr. Wilkins.</i>

711
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:10,268
Georgie, this is a nursery,

712
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:11,670
let me remind you,
and not a music hall.

713
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:14,205
Can we have another bath?

714
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,541
Oh, pish posh.

715
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:17,308
Now, John,
you'd best go downstairs

716
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:18,544
and help Ellen...

717
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:19,645
- Whoa!
- ...put away the dishes.

718
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:21,245
Yes, Mary Poppins.

719
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:23,281
Here, I can
put those away myself.

720
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:25,150
Very well, then.

721
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:27,553
Now, Georgie Banks...

722
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:29,321
if you were hoping
that I will let you

723
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:30,689
take this
sadly neglected kite...

724
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,224
to the park tomorrow,

725
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:33,525
you'd better start
patching it up this instant.

726
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:35,227
Yes, Mary Poppins.

727
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:37,830
Hmm.

728
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,800
Oh, let me help you
with those.

729
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:44,803
Oh, you're a good lad.

730
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:47,238
You're such a help, you are.

731
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:48,674
I only wish
I could help your father

732
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:50,475
save this poor old house.

733
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:53,712
I could sell my broach
and necklace, I suppose.

734
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:57,448
Matching set,
my old mum gave them to me.

735
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:58,784
You'd do that for us?

736
00:39:58,785 --> 00:40:00,986
What? Sell my
prized possessions?

737
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:02,721
Oh, no, I didn't
mean it like that.

738
00:40:02,722 --> 00:40:06,392
Oh, it's all right.
I think they're fakes, anyway.

739
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:09,529
No. Plenty in this house worth
more than them old trinkets.

740
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:14,634
If you'll excuse me, Ellen.

741
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:17,704
What's got into him?

742
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:25,376
Annabel!

743
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:27,478
- I know how to save the house!
- What do you mean?

744
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,580
If you two are going to keep
up all of this whispering...

745
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:30,716
I'd like you
to practice doing so

746
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:31,850
as loudly as possible.

747
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:33,552
It will still be bad manners,

748
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:35,555
but at least then we'll all
be in on the secret.

749
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:39,658
Oh, hello, Jack!

750
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:41,593
Mary Poppins,
how are you this fine evening?

751
00:40:41,594 --> 00:40:43,730
I'm settling in
quite nicely, thank you.

752
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:46,832
I was downstairs
with Ellen...

753
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:48,467
Do you know,
when I was a lad...

754
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:50,969
I used to wave up to the boy
and girl who lived here.

755
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,806
Oh. You mean
Michael and Jane.

756
00:40:53,606 --> 00:40:56,575
Ah, Miss Jane Banks!

757
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,743
I see Mr. Banks
about now and again.

758
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,445
It's been ages
since I've seen her.

759
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:01,280
Well, she lives in a flat
on the other side of town now.

760
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:03,550
I'm sure you'll bump into her
one of these days.

761
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:05,819
What are you doing?

762
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,386
You know we're not supposed
to touch that.

763
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,621
This is authentic
Royal Doulton china, Annabel.

764
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:12,057
Mother always said
it was priceless...

765
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:14,026
and I bet it'll be enough
to pay off Father's debt.

766
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:15,460
That's a terrible idea, John.

767
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:16,762
You know
Mother loved that bowl.

768
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:17,996
But she'd sell it herself
to save the house!

769
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,363
That was Mother's!
Put that back!

770
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:20,966
No, Georgie,
give it to me!

771
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,601
- No! Put it back!
- Let go, let go!

772
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:23,669
It's a good thing
you come along

773
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,070
when you did, Mary Poppins.

774
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,775
That didn't sound good,
now did it?

775
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:31,444
What are the three
of you up to?

776
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:35,314
- Give me the missing piece!
- I don't have it!

777
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:36,816
Well, look for it then!

778
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:44,724
Which of you broke the bowl?

779
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:50,063
- Georgie did.
- I did not! It was Annabel!

780
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,624
No, I didn't!
If John hadn't taken it...

781
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:54,500
Actually,
it was all three of them.

782
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,503
Mmm.

783
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:58,038
Who said that?

784
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:03,809
Oh, dear.

785
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,010
Look!
The picture's changed.

786
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:06,378
It looks
as though they've broken

787
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:07,780
your carriage wheel.

788
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:09,815
That they have.
It's useless now.

789
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:12,084
Useless
as a chocolate teapot.

790
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:13,752
The bowl is speaking!

791
00:42:13,753 --> 00:42:15,454
And who do we think
is gonna fix that?

792
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,056
Aye, there's the riddle.
Them what broke it fixes it.

793
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:18,490
That's what I say.

794
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:19,959
What do you think,
Mary Poppins?

795
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,627
Well, I suppose
we have no choice.

796
00:42:21,628 --> 00:42:23,096
But how are we
going to do that?

797
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:24,864
I know a bit
about fixing carriages.

798
00:42:24,865 --> 00:42:26,099
But we can't fix
the carriage wheel.

799
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,734
It isn't possible.

800
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:31,038
Everything is possible.
Even the impossible.

801
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,508
Now, gather 'round,
everyone. Spit, spot!

802
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:37,777
Georgie, don't forget Gillie.

803
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:38,912
Are we ready?

804
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:39,914
Ready.

805
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,543
Wow!

806
00:43:11,544 --> 00:43:12,946
What just happened?

807
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:15,548
Where are we?

808
00:43:16,884 --> 00:43:18,585
Looks like we're in china,
so to speak.

809
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:21,187
Over here, everyone.
This wheel won't fix itself.

810
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:23,790
Now, tread lightly,
this is fine porcelain,

811
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:26,025
and we don't want
to chip the glaze.

812
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:30,096
Whee!

813
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:32,599
Oh, Georgie, head up
and feet beneath you.

814
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,068
You too, John.

815
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:40,439
Excuse me, driver,
would you help us?

816
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,542
Well, Mary Poppins,
is it yourself?

817
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,144
- But he's...
- But you're...

818
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:49,148
- That's right, I'm Irish.
- I'm also part poodle.

819
00:43:50,684 --> 00:43:52,517
How wonderful
to see you, Shamus.

820
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm so sorry about all this.

821
00:43:53,921 --> 00:43:55,822
Now, would you help Jack
lift the carriage

822
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:57,957
while the children
put the wheel back on?

823
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,125
With pleasure!

824
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:01,127
She's talking to a dog!

825
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:03,563
Well, of course
she can talk.

826
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:06,772
Take your places,
everyone.

827
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:09,002
Ready?

828
00:44:09,003 --> 00:44:11,671
And lift.

829
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:16,043
Yes. Let's see now,
this should do it.

830
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:17,644
There we are, shipshape.

831
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:18,979
Not a bad job at all.

832
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,514
Suppose it'll have to do.

833
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:23,182
And back to the nursery we go.

834
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:24,583
Back already?

835
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:25,952
Can't we stay in this bowl
for a while?

836
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:28,254
I want a carriage ride.

837
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:29,924
I wouldn't mind one m'self.

838
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:34,661
Well, I suppose
it wouldn't do any harm.

839
00:44:34,662 --> 00:44:35,895
Shamus, would you mind?

840
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:37,163
Not in the least.

841
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:38,598
Climb aboard, everybody!

842
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:40,033
Hooray!

843
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:42,969
Mind the step,
plant yourselves comfy.

844
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:46,039
Now, where would we all like
to go on this fine, fine day?

845
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,243
The Royal Doulton Music Hall,
please.

846
00:44:49,244 --> 00:44:50,944
- Where?
- What's that?

847
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:52,912
We're on the brink
of an adventure, children,

848
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:55,149
don't spoil it
with too many questions.

849
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,616
Let's go, Clyde!

850
00:44:56,617 --> 00:44:58,885

1041
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,383
Bravo!

1042
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:33,969
Gillie!

1043
00:53:43,813 --> 00:53:45,514
Where's Georgie?

1044
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:47,649
I don't know.

1045
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,052
Take this.

1046
00:53:53,757 --> 00:53:55,357
What are you doing?

1047
00:53:56,594 --> 00:53:58,794
Well, well,
if it isn't the boy

1048
00:53:58,795 --> 00:54:00,796
who cracked the bowl.

1049
00:54:00,797 --> 00:54:04,198
We've waited a long time
for you Banks children...

1050
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,567
to come and visit us,

1051
00:54:05,568 --> 00:54:08,069
so we could pay a visit
to your nursery.

1052
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,139
But those are our things!

1053
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,808
Oh, not anymore,
they aren't.

1054
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:14,042
Give Gillie back!

1055
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:18,380
He's mine!
My mother made him for me!

1056
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:20,415
Hey! Leave our brother alone!

1057
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:21,817
Time to go, boys!

1058
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:24,020
Whoa!

1059
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,468
Annabel! Help!

1060
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:40,270
Georgie!

1061
00:54:41,705 --> 00:54:43,673
We're coming, Georgie!

1062
00:54:43,674 --> 00:54:44,841
John!

1063
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:49,611
Let me go! I want to go home!

1064
00:54:49,612 --> 00:54:52,515
What home?
You've lost your home!

1065
00:55:03,192 --> 00:55:04,593
Shamus!

1066
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:05,727
Clyde!

1067
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,195
That's right, it's us!

1068
00:55:07,196 --> 00:55:09,833
Let's go
get your brother back.

1069
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:20,209
We're gaining on 'em!

1070
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,344
Give it more speed!

1071
00:55:22,345 --> 00:55:23,746
Right away, sir.

1072
00:55:39,395 --> 00:55:40,797
Whoa!

1073
00:55:42,732 --> 00:55:43,866
Giddy-up, big fella!

1074
00:55:50,373 --> 00:55:53,644
We're closing in.
Get ready to jump!

1075
00:55:55,211 --> 00:55:57,848
Ready. And now!

1076
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:00,617
Well done, children!

1077
00:56:00,618 --> 00:56:02,885
Give 'em what-for!

1078
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,721
Get rid of them!

1079
00:56:04,722 --> 00:56:06,724
- But, sir!
- You heard me!

1080
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:09,826
Georgie,
are you all right?

1081
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:10,828
Annabel, look!

1082
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,818
- Stay with Georgie.
- Right.

1083
00:56:41,925 --> 00:56:43,626
Be careful!

1084
00:56:43,627 --> 00:56:44,728
What are you doing?

1085
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:15,893
Oh, no!

1086
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:19,729
The edge of the bowl!

1087
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:35,778
Georgie, it's all right,

1088
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:37,280
it's all right.

1089
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:38,815
My goodness me.

1090
00:57:40,284 --> 00:57:41,852
Shh. It's all right.

1091
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:47,490
You were having a nice
sort of nightmare, I must say.

1092
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:50,060
You were right, Mary Poppins!
A cover is not the book.

1093
00:57:50,061 --> 00:57:51,762
We thought they were nice,
but they were mean!

1094
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,529
Whatever are you
talking about?

1095
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,331
They tried to take Gillie!

1096
00:57:55,332 --> 00:57:58,868
No, Gillie is right here,
sleeping, as you should be.

1097
00:57:58,869 --> 00:58:01,504
But it was real!
They stole all our things...

1098
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:02,705
and the wolf said
we were never

1099
00:58:02,706 --> 00:58:04,006
going to see our home again!

1100
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:05,476
That is absurd.

1101
00:58:07,878 --> 00:58:10,379
But I had a nightmare
like that, too.

1102
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:13,583
So did I.
It seemed awfully real.

1103
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:15,819
I don't want to lose our home.

1104
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:18,888
You see, Georgie?

1105
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:21,091
That's why we wanted
Mother's bowl.

1106
00:58:21,092 --> 00:58:23,962
We were going to sell it
to save the house.

1107
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:28,365
I miss Mother.

1108
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:36,707
Oh, listen
to the three of you.

1109
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:38,642
You're all worrying
far too much.

1110
00:58:38,643 --> 00:58:44,448
After all, you can't lose
what you've never lost.

1111
00:58:44,449 --> 00:58:46,349
I don't understand.

1112
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,784

1134
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:41,098
And in the morning,
bright and early...

1135
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,633
we'll take that bowl
to my cousin.

1136
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:43,902

John, look!

1152
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,587
Mary Poppins' scarf.

1153
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:45,123
It wasn't a dream after all.

1154
01:02:45,124 --> 01:02:46,958
Shall we tell her?

1155
01:02:47,825 --> 01:02:48,826
Better not.

1156
01:02:49,761 --> 01:02:51,729
I expect she already knows.

1157
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:12,083
Blast the devil, too soon!

1158
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:15,888
Why can't those pea-brained
Big Ben buffoons get it right?

1159
01:03:17,623 --> 01:03:20,058
Ahoy there, fair lady!

1160
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:21,159
Hello!

1161
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,094
- Good morning. Oh!
- Oh!

1162
01:03:23,095 --> 01:03:24,762
I'm sorry, miss.

1163
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:26,130
Oh, no, no. It's quite
all right. Don't worry.

1164
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:27,266
- Let me help you with that.
- Thank you.

1165
01:03:27,267 --> 01:03:28,800
Good morning, Jane.

1166
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:30,168
I see you've bumped into Jack.

1167
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:31,903
The children and I are
heading into town

1168
01:03:31,904 --> 01:03:33,138
to get something fixed.

1169
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:34,704
Would you like to
come with us?

1170
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:37,241
Work calls, I'm afraid.
We've got a rally today.

1171
01:03:37,242 --> 01:03:40,711
Oh, that's right. You ought to
give Jack one of those flyers.

1172
01:03:41,914 --> 01:03:43,347
You're Miss Banks,
aren't you?

1173
01:03:43,348 --> 01:03:44,781
Yes.

1174
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:46,117
I don't know
if you remember me.

1175
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:47,218
I used to wave to you
when I'd see you

1176
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,187
up there in that very window.

1177
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:50,354
Yes.

1178
01:03:50,355 --> 01:03:51,722
Jack.

1179
01:03:51,723 --> 01:03:54,092
Yes, of course, I remember.

1180
01:03:54,093 --> 01:03:55,426
Call me Jane, please.

1181
01:03:55,427 --> 01:03:56,928
Of course,
I was much younger then.

1182
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:58,229
True...

1183
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:01,065
but your smile
hasn't changed a bit.

1184
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:04,202
Well, it's this afternoon,
if you can make it.

1185
01:04:04,203 --> 01:04:05,370
SPRUCE, eh?

1186
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:07,372
Good for you, Jane Banks.

1187
01:04:07,373 --> 01:04:08,873
All us lamplighters know

1188
01:04:08,874 --> 01:04:10,842
what a fine job you're doing
for the workers.

1189
01:04:10,843 --> 01:04:12,444
Well, we try our best.

1190
01:04:12,445 --> 01:04:13,945
If you ever need
a ladder raised

1191
01:04:13,946 --> 01:04:15,447
or a lamp lit,
consider it done.

1192
01:04:15,448 --> 01:04:18,783
Thank you, Jack.
Thank you.

1193
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,751
Polishing the keyhole, are we?

1194
01:04:21,752 --> 01:04:23,187
Look at this.

1195
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:25,958
Miss Jane's chatting with
that handsome lamplighter.

1196
01:04:27,692 --> 01:04:29,160
It looks like he's lit her up
as well, don't it?

1197
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,261
Oh, Ellen!

1198
01:04:30,262 --> 01:04:31,762
Oh, no,
nothing will come of it.

1199
01:04:31,763 --> 01:04:33,764
No, she says
that ship's sailed.

1200
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:35,299
And I say, there are
always other ships.

1201
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,434
My alarm didn't ring.

1202
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:39,003
Oh, dear. Let me help you.

1203
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,805
I'm gonna be late.

1204
01:04:40,806 --> 01:04:41,939
That's all that I need!

1205
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,341
Well, you're not late yet,
are you?

1206
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:44,809
Here you are.

1207
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:46,111
Off you go.

1208
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:50,715
Good morning, Michael.

1209
01:04:50,716 --> 01:04:52,284
Hello, forgive me,
I have to run.

1210
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:53,818
- Watch where you're... Michael!
- I am so sorry!

1211
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:54,919
Oh, it's fine.

1212
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,722
Um, I'm looking
for number 19.

1213
01:04:57,723 --> 01:04:59,091
It's two doors down.

1214
01:05:00,293 --> 01:05:02,727
Many thanks. Sincerely.

1215
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:05,998
Michael, your briefcase!

1216
01:05:05,999 --> 01:05:07,499
Blimey, he'd leave his head

1217
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,767
on the breakfast table
if it weren't screwed on.

1218
01:05:09,768 --> 01:05:11,335
Here, Ellen.
I'll take the briefcase.

1219
01:05:11,336 --> 01:05:13,371
The children and I are heading
that way on an errand.

1220
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:14,972
We'll stop
by the bank afterwards.

1221
01:05:14,973 --> 01:05:16,842
I'll give you a lift.
My rounds are done.

1222
01:05:17,342 --> 01:05:18,743
Wonderful.

1223
01:05:18,744 --> 01:05:20,512
All aboard, everyone. Come on.

1224
01:05:20,513 --> 01:05:22,313
On the bicycle?

1225
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:24,449
But there are five of us.
We can't all fit.

1226
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,451
The weight
on those wheels alone.

1227
01:05:26,452 --> 01:05:28,453
Mary Poppins,
how much do you weigh?

1228
01:05:28,454 --> 01:05:30,021
Never you mind about that.

1229
01:05:30,022 --> 01:05:32,291
It's all a question
of balance.

1230
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:35,060
- Annabel here.
- Whoa!

1231
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:37,329
- And then John.
- Whoa!

1232
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:39,264
Oh, sit up straight!
You're not flour bags.

1233
01:05:39,265 --> 01:05:41,533
- Georgie at the front.
- Yay!

1234
01:05:41,534 --> 01:05:43,502
Mary Poppins, you here.

1235
01:05:43,503 --> 01:05:44,870
- I've got it!
- Blimey!

1236
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:46,271
All right, everybody.

1237
01:05:46,272 --> 01:05:48,273
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

1238
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:50,008
Ready and charged, sir.

1239
01:05:50,009 --> 01:05:51,910
- Ready, everyone?
- Ready!

1240
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:53,278
Are you sure
this is quite safe?

1241
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:54,913
Not in the slightest.
Ready.

1242
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:55,981
Three!

1243
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:57,049
Two!

1244
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,950
- Steady!
- One!

1245
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,418
- Fire!
- Go!

1246
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:31,784
Now, pull over, right ahead.
Thank you, Jack.

1247
01:06:36,256 --> 01:06:39,091
Right. Off we go,
jiggity-jog.

1248
01:06:39,092 --> 01:06:40,159
Thank you, Georgie.

1249
01:06:42,862 --> 01:06:43,997
This way, please.

1250
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:55,906
Never noticed
this alley before.

1251
01:06:55,907 --> 01:06:57,209
Well, clearly
you've never had

1252
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,345
a Royal Doulton bowl
that wanted mending.

1253
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:01,414
Straight ahead.

1254
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:07,286
Here we are.

1255
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:12,057
"Topotrepolovsky's
all repairs,

1256
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:13,892
"large and small fix-it shop."

1257
01:07:13,893 --> 01:07:16,061
Looks as though it's just
a small fix-it shop today.

1258
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:17,496
That's just what we want.

1259
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:20,566
The bowl only needs
a small fix, after all.

1260
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,035
So now my head
is a door knocker.

1261
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:26,472
I suppose my beak might be
useful for opening cans.

1262
01:07:26,473 --> 01:07:28,975
You fuss, fuss, fuss.
Don't be so dramatic.

1263
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:35,881
Cousin Topsy!

1264
01:07:36,582 --> 01:07:38,650
Mary Poppins!

1265
01:07:38,651 --> 01:07:41,520
Oh, for the love
of all that is holy...

1266
01:07:41,521 --> 01:07:43,188
do not come in!

1267
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,890
Don't be so rude!

1268
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:47,125
Please stay away.

1269
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:49,961
It is Second Wednesday!

1270
01:07:49,962 --> 01:07:53,899
Second Wednesday. Oh, dear.
I'd forgotten.

1271
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,570
Still, today or never,
that's my motto.

1272
01:07:58,004 --> 01:07:59,271
Ouch!

1273
01:07:59,272 --> 01:08:00,507
There we are!

1274
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:07,013
Follow me.

1275
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:12,017
So, in you come.

1276
01:08:12,018 --> 01:08:15,421
You do not listen to Topsy.

1277
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,226
Oh, no!

1278
01:08:20,227 --> 01:08:22,295
It has begun!

1279
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:36,041
Now, what do you want?

1280
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:37,442
You have guests, cousin.

1281
01:08:37,443 --> 01:08:39,411
You might at least greet them
at the door.

1282
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:41,213
And how am I to
do that, please,

1283
01:08:41,214 --> 01:08:44,650
when I am down here,
up on the ceiling?

1284
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:47,018
Very well,
we'll come to you.

1285
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:49,020
Excuse me, please, Georgie.

1286
01:08:49,021 --> 01:08:50,956
Now, this way.

1287
01:08:50,957 --> 01:08:53,626
Be careful on the way up.

1288
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:55,194
Why be careful?

1289
01:08:55,195 --> 01:08:58,131
Leave it all for Topsy to fix.

1290
01:08:58,132 --> 01:09:01,067
Climb on my shelves.
Step on the toys.

1291
01:09:02,503 --> 01:09:05,671
Kick the little china dolls
in their faces.

1292
01:09:05,672 --> 01:09:08,408
John, Annabel,
Georgie and Jack...

1293
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:09,674
this is my cousin.

1294
01:09:09,675 --> 01:09:12,577
Second cousin,
many times removed.

1295
01:09:12,578 --> 01:09:15,615
Tatiana Antanasia
Cositori Topotrepolovsky.

1296
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:19,652
Oh, but you may call me Topsy.

1297
01:09:19,653 --> 01:09:21,153
That's an unusual accent
you've got there.

1298
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:22,320
Where are you from?

1299
01:09:22,321 --> 01:09:23,656
Oh, that's very
interesting story...

1300
01:09:23,657 --> 01:09:25,290
We have no idea.

1301
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,192
We need you
to fix this bowl, dear.

1302
01:09:27,193 --> 01:09:30,196
No, no, no. It is as
I have told to you...

1303
01:09:30,197 --> 01:09:31,997
second Wednesday
of the month...

1304
01:09:31,998 --> 01:09:34,467
when everything
is turning turtle.

1305
01:09:34,468 --> 01:09:36,068
"Turning turtle"?

1306
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:37,603
What exactly does that mean?

1307
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:41,140
It means my whole world
goes flippity-flop

1308
01:09:41,141 --> 01:09:43,009
like a turtle on his back.

1309
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,077
And I don't know
my up from my down,

1310
01:09:45,078 --> 01:09:46,646
my east from my west.

1311
01:09:46,647 --> 01:09:49,148
My topsy from my bottomsy.

1312
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:51,551
Yes, I think
we've all grasped the concept.

1313
01:09:51,552 --> 01:09:53,654
Good. That's quick for you.

1314
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:57,422
You see, my littles,
anything I try to fix...

1315
01:09:57,423 --> 01:10:00,325
on Second Wednesday
goes kerflooey.

1316
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:02,227
Kerflooey.

1317
01:10:02,228 --> 01:10:03,429
Kerflooey!

1318
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:05,731
Please, cousin,
you have always said

1319
01:10:05,732 --> 01:10:07,333
that you can fix anything.

1320
01:10:07,334 --> 01:10:09,569
Sweet girl,
you tell Mary Poppins,

1321
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,136
who doesn't listen...

1322
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:12,605

1323
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:16,175

Excuse me,
but do you have any idea

1410
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:42,857
how much our bowl
might be worth?

1411
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,845
In money?

1412
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:46,847
Not very much, I'm afraid.

1413
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:50,317
But that doesn't make it
any less beautiful.

1414
01:14:50,318 --> 01:14:52,986
Our mother always said
it was priceless.

1415
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:56,858
Well, I'm sure it was to her.

1416
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:03,730
Mary Poppins is right,
for once.

1417
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:06,534
It is all in the way
that you look at things.

1418
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:09,503
Thank you, cousin.

1419
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:11,471
Now, come along, children.
Get your hats.

1420
01:15:11,472 --> 01:15:14,642
And don't you worry
about Mother's bowl.

1421
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:18,079
I will fix
and make perfect for you.

1422
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,115
So you come back, maybe,
next Second Wednesday?

1423
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,751
Yes. Spit spot.

1424
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:26,821
Nice meeting you,
Topsy Turvy.

1425
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,657
"Topsy Turvy."

1426
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:32,528
I like. It's catchy.

1427
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,997
Now, what do we do?

1428
01:15:36,998 --> 01:15:38,532
I have no idea.

1429
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:40,101
Well, like Topsy said...

1430
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,803
maybe we should start
looking at things differently.

1431
01:15:45,373 --> 01:15:46,640
Oh, marvelous.

1432
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:47,707
It looks like
things are starting

1433
01:15:47,708 --> 01:15:49,477
to turn around for my cousin.

1434
01:15:56,484 --> 01:15:57,885
Mary Poppins,

1435
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,053
this is not
the quickest way to the bank.

1436
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,688
It is today.

1437
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,389
Look, there's Aunt Jane!

1438
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,492
Aunt Jane! Aunt Jane!

1439
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:05,827
Hello!

1440
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,128
Off to the rally,
are you, Jane?

1441
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,763
Yes. All still here,
thank goodness.

1442
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,598
Nobody fell off.

1443
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,033
Say, I could come back and
give you a hand with all that

1444
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:13,868
once I drop the others
at the bank.

1445
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:16,470
Oh, no, please don't worry.
I'm perfectly fine. Really.

1446
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,006
Oh, nonsense. The bank's
just around the corner...

1447
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:19,074
and the children and I have

1448
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,675
plenty of legs
to get us there.

1449
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,577
Now, climb off, everyone.
Ready, and jump.

1450
01:16:23,578 --> 01:16:25,012
Steady the bicycle for me,
would you, children?

1451
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,080
You're sure
you don't mind, Jack?

1452
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,714
'Course not.

1453
01:16:27,715 --> 01:16:29,416
I was hoping to drop by
that rally of yours, anyway.

1454
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,185
You were? Oh, good.

1455
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,754
You can ride
in the front basket.

1456
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,156
Really?

1457
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:36,423
I think
she'll be better here.

1458
01:16:36,424 --> 01:16:37,992
Here, is it?

1459
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,594
- Yeah. Up you go.
- Now, where should I hold on?

1460
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,962
Handlebars are fine.

1461
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,797
- Ready?
- Yes! Ready as I'll ever...

1462
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,736
My goodness!

1463
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:51,539
Now, be careful here, 'cause
there are cars crossing!

1464
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,820
That's all right.
They'll see us.

1465
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,151
Right, that's enough.

1466
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,624
Step along, children.

1467
01:17:15,496 --> 01:17:16,964
There must be
someone at this bank

1468
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,699
who could help us
save our house.

1469
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,067
I'm sure
Father's already asked.

1470
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,602
Well, we haven't.

1471
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:22,970
Maybe we could get them

1472
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:24,238
to see things
from a new point of view.

1473
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,140
Sit over there,
please, children.

1474
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,541
Good afternoon.

1475
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,876
I'd like to see
Mr. Michael...

1476
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,678
I'll need a signature
for those, sir.

1477
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,647
Of course.
Excuse me a moment.

1478
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,682
Well!

1479
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:40,989
We mustn't be late
for Mr. Wilkins.

1480
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,527
What did you do that for?

1481
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,063
You hurt his feelings.

1482
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:50,132
You do know who those men are,
don't you, Georgie?

1483
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,834
Yes. They're the lawyers.

1484
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,568
He's the nice one.

1485
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:57,705
Maybe we could convince him
to help us.

1486
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,507
Worth a try.

1487
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,743
Today or never,
that's my motto.

1488
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,148
Come on!

1489
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,757
Now, how can I help you?

1490
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,228
Finally. I'd like to see
Mr. Michael Banks, please.

1491
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,164
<i>Hello. Operator.</i>

1492
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:30,039
- May we go in?
- He's expecting you.

1493
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:39,047
Is there something I can do
for you, children?

1494
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:41,017
May I have a sweet,
please?

1495
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:45,052
Yes, of course you can, dear.

1496
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,153
You all can.

1497
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,855
Is in foreclosure.

1498
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,690
Mr. Michael Banks,
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1499
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:50,992
In foreclosure.

1500
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:53,261
How many repossessions,
so far, this month?

1501
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:55,796
19, sir. And we have
nearly that amount

1502
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,765
scheduled for next week alone.

1503
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,001
Who'd have thought this slump

1504
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:00,601
would be so good
for business, eh?

1505
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:02,237
I wonder, Mr. Wilkins,
if, perhaps...

1506
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,206
as Michael Banks
is an employee,

1507
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,141
you might consider
giving him a few more weeks.

1508
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:08,143
And lose our chance
to get that house?

1509
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:09,277
I mean...

1510
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:11,613
I don't like to lose,
Mr. Frye.

1511
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:18,186
<i>Didn't I ask
for more tea, Miss Farthing?</i>

1512
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:20,256
Yes, sir. Right away,
Mr. Wilkins.

1513
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:24,694
Why don't you all
help yourselves?

1514
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,764
Come on.

1515
01:19:28,765 --> 01:19:32,666
"Office of the Bank Chairman."
We can't go in there.

1516
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,668
I'm running
a business, not a charity.

1517
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:36,071
It's just that, well...

1518
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:37,605
his family has suffered

1519
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,174
tremendous hardship
this past year...

1520
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:41,675
You are not giving
Banks one more second...

1521
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,378
to pay off that loan.

1522
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,313
Do I make myself clear?

1523
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:46,781
- Look.
- Shh!

1524
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,150
It's the wolf.

1525
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:49,718
In two days,
Banks will be out

1526
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:51,853
on that street
and the house...

1527
01:19:51,854 --> 01:19:52,855
will be ours.

1528
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,390
Georgie, no!

1529
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:58,026
You can't steal our house.
I'm telling my father!

1530
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,161
Steal your...?

1531
01:19:59,162 --> 01:20:00,295
Who are you?

1532
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,731
These are the Banks children.

1533
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:04,900
Are they?

1534
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:06,369
Come here, boy,
I think you might have...

1535
01:20:06,370 --> 01:20:07,769
- Let's go, Georgie!
- Run!

1536
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,205
Close that door,
Miss Farthing!

1537
01:20:13,343 --> 01:20:14,676
Fool!

1538
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:15,845
Stop them.

1539
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:28,256
Oh, there you are,
Michael.

1540
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,657
The children and I
brought you your briefcase.

1541
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,093
Oh, thank you.

1542
01:20:31,094 --> 01:20:32,227
- You're welcome.
- Where are the children?

1543
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:34,129
Father!
Father! Father!

1544
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,664
- Help!
- Wait!

1545
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:36,898
What is it?
What's happened?

1546
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:38,934
He's the wolf
trying to steal our house!

1547
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:40,335
What on earth
are you talking about?

1548
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,037
I'm afraid
your children

1549
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:44,407
burst into my office
just now, Banks.

1550
01:20:44,408 --> 01:20:46,842
What?

1551
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:48,677
I was just seeing if anything could
be done about extending your loan...

1552
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:49,978
when they came in claiming

1553
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:52,013
I was trying
to steal your house.

1554
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,282
He is! We heard him!

1555
01:20:53,283 --> 01:20:54,716
Mr. Wilkins
is trying to help us!

1556
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:56,185
But then,
why was he chasing us?

1557
01:20:56,186 --> 01:20:57,886
I just thought they might
stop running around

1558
01:20:57,887 --> 01:20:59,688
and making a scene
if I offered them some sweets.

1559
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,225
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wilkins.

1560
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,227
See it doesn't happen again.

1561
01:21:04,228 --> 01:21:07,296
After all, you don't
want your father...

1562
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:10,966
losing his position
on account of you, do you?

1563
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:12,300
Hmm?

1564
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:14,236
I know time is
running short, Banks...

1565
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:16,271
but I want you to have
every chance

1566
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:17,873
of paying off that loan.

1567
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,841
So, I will make sure
that I'm in my office

1568
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:21,109
on Friday evening...

1569
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:22,811
until the last stroke
of midnight.

1570
01:21:22,812 --> 01:21:24,012
You have my word.

1571
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,315
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

1572
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:27,317
Gentlemen?

1573
01:21:32,256 --> 01:21:33,322
But, Father,
he really did do it.

1574
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:34,690
Not another word!

1575
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:37,893
- Take them home this instant!
- Yes, sir.

1576
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:40,129
We'll discuss this
when I get back!

1577
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:41,764
Come along, children.

1578
01:21:51,942 --> 01:21:53,442
Now we've done it,
haven't we?

1579
01:21:53,443 --> 01:21:55,077
I don't think
I've ever seen Father

1580
01:21:55,078 --> 01:21:56,379
that upset with us before.

1581
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:57,979
But we were
telling the truth!

1582
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,414
That doesn't
matter, Georgie.

1583
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,049
We got him into trouble.

1584
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,218
And he doesn't even know
that we broke Mother's bowl.

1585
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:05,855
Everything we've tried to fix,
we've only made it worse.

1586
01:22:33,383 --> 01:22:35,251
Which way do we go,
Mary Poppins?

1587
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:36,953
Now,
why would you ask me?

1588
01:22:36,954 --> 01:22:39,055
The three of you are leading
the way, after all.

1589
01:22:39,056 --> 01:22:40,256
- Us?
- But we were...

1590
01:22:40,257 --> 01:22:42,091
Walking around in a fog.

1591
01:22:42,092 --> 01:22:45,461
No, we weren't. I mean,
we are in a fog, but...

1592
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:46,962
We were only talking.

1593
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,830
Yes, too focused
on where you've been

1594
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:50,098
to pay attention
to where you're going.

1595
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:51,567
But Father told us
to go straight home!

1596
01:22:51,568 --> 01:22:53,236
He'll be furious
if we're late.

1597
01:22:53,237 --> 01:22:55,238
Not much to be done
about that now, is there?

1598
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:56,972
Are we lost, then?

1599
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:58,441
That would depend
on where you want to go.

1600
01:22:58,442 --> 01:22:59,508
Jack!

1601
01:22:59,509 --> 01:23:01,010
At your service.

1602
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:02,945
Say, what's with
all the glum faces?

1603
01:23:02,946 --> 01:23:04,880
Lost sixpence
and found a penny?

1604
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:05,982
We've made a mess
of everything.

1605
01:23:05,983 --> 01:23:07,216
Father's furious with us.

1606
01:23:07,217 --> 01:23:09,852
And we can't find
our way home.

1607
01:23:09,853 --> 01:23:11,087
Lost?

1608
01:23:11,088 --> 01:23:12,289
Are you, Mary Poppins?

1609
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:14,758
Hopelessly.

1610
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:17,893
Well, now, I'm no expert...

1611
01:23:17,894 --> 01:23:19,328
but if ever I lose my way,

1612
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:21,832

Where on earth
have you all been?

1732
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:52,543
I told you to bring them
straight home.

1733
01:31:52,544 --> 01:31:53,745
I've been worried sick!

1734
01:31:53,746 --> 01:31:54,846
We're sorry
we're late, Father.

1735
01:31:54,847 --> 01:31:56,480
It wasn't
Mary Poppins' fault.

1736
01:31:56,481 --> 01:31:58,049
We got lost in the fog.

1737
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,886
Jack and the leeries led us
down the frog and toad.

1738
01:32:00,887 --> 01:32:02,687
He means road.

1739
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,556
So you've been off filling
the children's heads

1740
01:32:04,557 --> 01:32:05,991
with stuff and nonsense.

1741
01:32:05,992 --> 01:32:08,727
I've heard quite enough.
Come in at once!

1742
01:32:08,728 --> 01:32:09,995
Best to take my leave.
Good night, Mary Poppins.

1743
01:32:09,996 --> 01:32:11,062
Good night, Jack.

1744
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:12,064
Into the parlor, go on.

1745
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:14,834
Go on.

1746
01:32:19,005 --> 01:32:21,405
Don't be too hard
on 'em, sir.

1747
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:23,074
They're only children,
after all.

1748
01:32:23,075 --> 01:32:24,910
I know they're children,
my children,

1749
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:26,644
and I will deal with them
as I see fit.

1750
01:32:26,645 --> 01:32:28,847
- Now leave us to it.
- Yes, sir.

1751
01:32:28,848 --> 01:32:30,315
Not you, Mary Poppins.
In here.

1752
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,417
Very well, sir.

1753
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:43,629
You could have
lost me my job.

1754
01:32:44,797 --> 01:32:46,932
Do you understand that?

1755
01:32:46,933 --> 01:32:49,801
Have you any idea
how difficult it is to find

1756
01:32:49,802 --> 01:32:52,103
a good position like mine
these days?

1757
01:32:52,104 --> 01:32:54,840
But there you all were,
tearing about like a...

1758
01:32:54,841 --> 01:32:56,508
And you, Mary Poppins,

1759
01:32:56,509 --> 01:32:58,810
I thought you were here
to look after these children.

1760
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:01,780
It wasn't her doing,
it was me.

1761
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:04,016
No, it was us.

1762
01:33:04,017 --> 01:33:06,585
We thought maybe
if we talked to Mr. Frye...

1763
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:08,519
he could give you more time
to save the house.

1764
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,855
We were only
trying to help.

1765
01:33:09,856 --> 01:33:11,057
Well, you didn't help!

1766
01:33:12,124 --> 01:33:13,825
Now...

1767
01:33:13,826 --> 01:33:16,761
I know it's been a hard year
for our family...

1768
01:33:16,762 --> 01:33:18,797
and I've done all I can...

1769
01:33:18,798 --> 01:33:21,132
to keep you all from worrying,
but I can't do this on my own.

1770
01:33:21,133 --> 01:33:23,935
It's too hard. I just...

1771
01:33:23,936 --> 01:33:25,837
I'm barely holding it
together as it is.

1772
01:33:25,838 --> 01:33:27,839
I can't even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning...

1773
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,074
and there's no more time,

1774
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:30,675
we're about to lose
our home...

1775
01:33:30,676 --> 01:33:32,511
and I can't lose this house.
I just can't.

1776
01:33:34,147 --> 01:33:35,881
I don't know what to do.

1777
01:33:35,882 --> 01:33:37,842
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to do.

1778
01:33:40,953 --> 01:33:43,656
Everything's fallen to pieces
since your mother...

1779
01:33:55,202 --> 01:33:57,770
Haven't we lost
enough already?

1780
01:34:02,108 --> 01:34:04,676
We haven't lost Mother.

1781
01:34:04,677 --> 01:34:06,412
Not really.

When did you all
get so clever?

1791
01:35:00,968 --> 01:35:03,070
Last night,
Mary Poppins told us...

1792
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,542
I hope I'm as clever as you
when I grow up.

1793
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:13,212
You're right.

1794
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:16,115
Of course, you're right,
Georgie.

1795
01:35:16,116 --> 01:35:18,785
Your mother's not gone.
She's in your smile.

1796
01:35:20,854 --> 01:35:23,089
And in your walk, John...

1797
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:26,125
and Annabel's eyes.

1798
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:29,796
And she'll always be with us
wherever we go.

1799
01:35:35,935 --> 01:35:37,602
Love you.

1800
01:35:37,603 --> 01:35:40,840
Now, run along, wash your
hands, get ready for dinner.

1801
01:35:47,613 --> 01:35:48,680
Did you have something
to do with them

1802
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:49,682
trying to save the house?

1803
01:35:51,284 --> 01:35:53,119
I never said a word.

1804
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,955
It was
all the children's idea.

1805
01:35:56,857 --> 01:35:58,357
The whole time
I've been looking after them,

1806
01:35:58,358 --> 01:35:59,725
they've been looking after me.

1807
01:35:59,726 --> 01:36:01,160
I had it all backward.

1808
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:02,929
A Banks family trait.

1809
01:36:04,197 --> 01:36:05,932
What was I thinking?

1810
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:11,604
Some people think
a great deal too much.

1811
01:36:11,605 --> 01:36:13,241
Of that I'm certain.

1812
01:37:16,069 --> 01:37:18,137
Here, Jane.
Let me help you with that.

1813
01:37:18,138 --> 01:37:19,172
Oh, thank you.

1814
01:37:20,107 --> 01:37:21,807
No luck?

1815
01:37:21,808 --> 01:37:24,043
We can look through
everything again if you like.

1816
01:37:24,044 --> 01:37:27,113
No. No, there's no point.
It's nearly midnight.

1817
01:37:27,114 --> 01:37:29,982
We tried our best, but
thank you, Jack, so much...

1818
01:37:29,983 --> 01:37:33,085
and thanks to all your friends
for helping us. Thank you.

1819
01:37:33,086 --> 01:37:34,187
Of course.

1820
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:35,788
Anything for you.

1821
01:37:36,923 --> 01:37:38,326
We'll be out in a moment.

1822
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:12,725
The children
have packed up

1823
01:38:12,726 --> 01:38:14,059
the last of their things
themselves.

1824
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,895
Well done, everyone.

1825
01:38:15,896 --> 01:38:17,330
All right,
have you got Gillie?

1826
01:38:17,331 --> 01:38:18,398
Yes, Father.

1827
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:19,832
Good, good.

1828
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:21,468
Good riddance
to that old kitchen.

1829
01:38:21,469 --> 01:38:23,370
Never could figure out
that stove.

1830
01:38:24,505 --> 01:38:26,206
All right, well...

1831
01:38:26,207 --> 01:38:28,808
we've spent every last moment
that we can here.

1832
01:38:28,809 --> 01:38:30,878
It's time to say goodbye.

1833
01:38:33,047 --> 01:38:34,748
Goodbye, old friend!

1834
01:38:34,749 --> 01:38:37,251
Goodbye, old friend!

1835
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:48,127
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1836
01:38:48,128 --> 01:38:50,464
- Hello, Willoughby.
- Miss Lark. Admiral.

1837
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:55,535
What are you all
doing here so late?

1838
01:38:55,536 --> 01:38:57,504
We've been waitin'
to see you off, sir.

1839
01:38:57,505 --> 01:38:59,206
We'd be here no matter
what the hour.

1840
01:38:59,207 --> 01:39:00,906
If you or your family

1841
01:39:00,907 --> 01:39:02,409
should ever need
a place to stay...

1842
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:04,978
Willoughby and I would be
happy for the company.

1843
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:06,313
That's very kind of you,
Miss Lark.

1844
01:39:06,314 --> 01:39:08,081
Jane's offered to put us up
in her flat...

1845
01:39:08,082 --> 01:39:09,416
at least for the time being.

1846
01:39:09,417 --> 01:39:11,551
No, forever,
for as long as you'd like.

1847
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:13,220
I wish you'd come
with us, Ellen.

1848
01:39:13,221 --> 01:39:14,888
Oh, don't you worry about me.

1849
01:39:14,889 --> 01:39:17,924
I got a nice room fixed up
at my sister's.

1850
01:39:17,925 --> 01:39:20,026
You won't leave us,
will you, Mary Poppins?

1851
01:39:20,027 --> 01:39:21,529
Oh, don't be silly.

1852
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:23,497
She says she's not leaving
until the door opens.

1853
01:39:23,498 --> 01:39:25,966
In any case,
your home is with us.

1854
01:39:25,967 --> 01:39:28,168
I'm pleased she got caught
on your string, Georgie.

1855
01:39:28,169 --> 01:39:29,236
My kite!

1856
01:39:29,237 --> 01:39:30,471
I forgot my kite!

1857
01:39:30,472 --> 01:39:32,171
Very well,
but be quick about it.

1858
01:39:32,172 --> 01:39:33,573
The Admiral's got something

1859
01:39:33,574 --> 01:39:36,243
he would like to give you,
Mr. Banks, sir.

1860
01:39:36,244 --> 01:39:40,480
The <i>H.M.S. Glad Tidings,</i>
I commanded her myself.

1861
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:43,816
May she guide you
safely into port.

1862
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,585
Thank you very much, Admiral.

1863
01:39:45,586 --> 01:39:48,188
I will take
very good care of her.

1864
01:39:48,189 --> 01:39:51,124
Eight bells, Mr. Binnacle,
time to man our posts!

1865
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:53,059
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Mr. Banks, sir.

1866
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:54,494
- Bye. Bye.
- Goodbye, Binnacle.

1867
01:39:54,495 --> 01:39:55,862
- I found it!
- Bye, Miss Lark.

1868
01:39:55,863 --> 01:39:57,397
Bye, Willoughby.

1869
01:39:57,398 --> 01:39:59,499
Oh, I'm not sure that's gonna
get off the ground anymore.

1870
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,835
It looks more glue than kite.

1871
01:40:01,836 --> 01:40:03,236
Georgie...

1872
01:40:03,237 --> 01:40:05,872
did you patch this up
with one of my old drawings?

1873
01:40:05,873 --> 01:40:08,409
It looks like you've done
a fine job, there.

1874
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:09,477
Look.

1875
01:40:09,478 --> 01:40:11,312
Can you see?

1876
01:40:11,313 --> 01:40:13,980
That's all of us together...

1877
01:40:13,981 --> 01:40:15,850
in front of the, uh...

1878
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:20,454
- What is it, Father?
- Wait.

1879
01:40:25,926 --> 01:40:27,427
"Certificate of shares"!

1880
01:40:27,428 --> 01:40:28,862
This is it. This is what
we've been looking for!

1881
01:40:28,863 --> 01:40:30,163
Yes! Yes!

1882
01:40:30,164 --> 01:40:31,965
We need
to get to the bank!

1883
01:40:31,966 --> 01:40:33,166
What's the time? Anyone?

1884
01:40:33,167 --> 01:40:34,467
Um, seven minutes to midnight.

1885
01:40:34,468 --> 01:40:36,002
Seven minutes?
It's not enough time.

1886
01:40:36,003 --> 01:40:37,370
We need to be at the bank
by midnight.

1887
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:38,639
- Take the van.
- No, it's no good.

1888
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,006
You still wouldn't
make it in time.

1889
01:40:40,007 --> 01:40:41,274
- Well, what can we do?
- Oh...

1890
01:40:41,275 --> 01:40:42,342
Nothing. We can't
turn back time.

1891
01:40:42,343 --> 01:40:43,977
Why not?

1892
01:40:43,978 --> 01:40:45,212
Everything is possible.

1893
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,081
Even the impossible.

1894
01:40:48,082 --> 01:40:50,083
Can we do that,
Mary Poppins?

1895
01:40:50,084 --> 01:40:52,520
Can we turn back time?

1896
01:40:52,521 --> 01:40:55,055
Well, I don't see why
that couldn't be arranged.

1897
01:40:55,056 --> 01:40:57,291
But that's ridiculous.

1898
01:40:57,292 --> 01:40:59,126
Indeed it is, Michael.
It's nonsense.

1899
01:40:59,127 --> 01:41:00,594
Foolishness!

1900
01:41:00,595 --> 01:41:02,496
It makes no sense!
And if it makes no sense...

1901
01:41:02,497 --> 01:41:03,998
It can't be true!

1902
01:41:03,999 --> 01:41:05,132
What are you
all talking about?

1903
01:41:05,133 --> 01:41:06,434
Never you mind about that.

1904
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,967
You just get that kite
to the bank...

1905
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,336
as fast as possible,
and leave the rest to us.

1906
01:41:09,337 --> 01:41:11,004
- How will you...
- Go!

1907
01:41:11,005 --> 01:41:12,138
Now, we'll need
a lot of help, Jack.

1908
01:41:12,139 --> 01:41:13,506
Good as done!

1909
01:41:13,507 --> 01:41:15,008
- Go and gather the leeries!
- Right.

1910
01:41:15,009 --> 01:41:16,610
Children, help me
ready the bicycle.

1911
01:41:16,611 --> 01:41:18,579
I'll take the reins this time.
Speed is of the essence.

1912
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:21,014
Have you ever ridden
a bicycle like this before?

1913
01:41:21,015 --> 01:41:23,917
Oh, please. How different can
it be from riding an elephant?

1914
01:41:31,025 --> 01:41:34,094
Ready, and up!

1915
01:41:34,095 --> 01:41:36,130
Now, all we have to do
is turn back time.

1916
01:41:41,503 --> 01:41:43,071
This is fun!

1917
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,014
A very good week's work,
gentlemen.

1918
01:42:27,015 --> 01:42:28,382
Thank you, sir.

1919
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:31,685
It look as if Banks won't be
joining us tonight.

1920
01:42:31,686 --> 01:42:33,354
He does have
a few more minutes, sir.

1921
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:35,724
You said you'd wait until
the last stroke of midnight.

1922
01:42:35,725 --> 01:42:37,192
Yes, I know that!

1923
01:42:38,059 --> 01:42:40,161
So we wait.

1924
01:42:40,162 --> 01:42:42,665
I'm a man of my word.

1925
01:42:50,439 --> 01:42:52,071
How much time do we have?

1926
01:42:52,072 --> 01:42:54,276
Um, there's only
five minutes left, I think.

1927
01:43:04,286 --> 01:43:06,488
Good. Now over
to the tower, boys!

1928
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:10,324
Sorry, this is as far
as you go.

1929
01:43:10,325 --> 01:43:11,993
Back in a flash.

1930
01:43:24,507 --> 01:43:26,208
- Come on!
- Come on, lads!

1931
01:43:34,683 --> 01:43:36,150
Ladder!

1932
01:43:36,151 --> 01:43:37,485
Jack!

1933
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,609
- Ladder!
- Ladder!

1934
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:02,130
- Ladder!
- Ladder!

1935
01:44:16,626 --> 01:44:18,060
No, I can't watch!

1936
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,569
I mean, you would think
they'd never done this before.

1937
01:44:40,248 --> 01:44:41,717
What are we gonna do?

1938
01:44:43,553 --> 01:44:45,421
I've got an idea! Come on!

1939
01:45:12,414 --> 01:45:13,415
Now!

1940
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:20,756
Yay!

1941
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:43,511
Jack! You can turn
the time back now!

1942
01:45:43,512 --> 01:45:46,247
How? I can't reach the hands!

1943
01:45:46,248 --> 01:45:48,416
Oh, honestly.

1944
01:45:48,417 --> 01:45:49,684
They better hurry.

1945
01:45:49,685 --> 01:45:51,454
We have less than
a minute to go.

1946
01:45:55,523 --> 01:45:57,291
We're too late, Jack!

1947
01:45:57,292 --> 01:45:58,894
There's got to be a way!

1948
01:45:59,862 --> 01:46:00,863
Look!

1949
01:46:22,518 --> 01:46:26,857
And three,
two, one...

1950
01:46:29,759 --> 01:46:31,794
Why hasn't Big Ben chimed?

1951
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:33,361
Perhaps your watch
is running fast.

1952
01:46:33,362 --> 01:46:35,364
Don't be a simpleton,
my watch never runs fast.

1953
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,236
Big Ben's gone dark.

1954
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:44,774
Relight the clock,
Jack, quickly.

1955
01:46:50,746 --> 01:46:53,615
Look. They've relit Big Ben.

1956
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:55,350
But that time is wrong.

1957
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:57,453
The clock must have stopped.

1958
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:06,962
That's Banks.

1959
01:47:06,963 --> 01:47:08,697
He's made it in time!

1960
01:47:08,698 --> 01:47:10,565
Not yet he hasn't. Get down
there and make sure...

1961
01:47:10,566 --> 01:47:12,400
he doesn't get inside until
that blasted clock strikes 12.

1962
01:47:12,401 --> 01:47:14,671
- But, sir...
- Now, Mr. Frye!

1963
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,419
Lock it, Mr. Frye!

1964
01:47:33,022 --> 01:47:34,422
Hello!

1965
01:47:34,423 --> 01:47:35,890
Hello!
Let us in, please!

1966
01:47:35,891 --> 01:47:37,358
Please, let us in!

1967
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:38,693
Hello?

1968
01:47:38,694 --> 01:47:40,361
Hello?

1969
01:47:40,362 --> 01:47:41,563
- Jane.
- What?

1970
01:47:41,564 --> 01:47:43,065
Let's...

1971
01:47:43,066 --> 01:47:44,901
Let's go fly a kite.

1972
01:47:46,937 --> 01:47:48,536
There it is!
It's the one with the light.

1973
01:47:48,537 --> 01:47:50,538
The first one? Okay.

1974
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:51,974
You run. I'll unspool.

1975
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:53,576
Yes, quickly!

1976
01:47:58,380 --> 01:47:59,514
Come on!

1977
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,649
Come on!

1978
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:02,384
Hello!

1979
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:09,760
It won't work.
He's never gonna see it.

1980
01:48:24,707 --> 01:48:26,547
- Let's get in.
- Yes, let's go!

1981
01:48:31,081 --> 01:48:32,647
Let us in, please!

1982
01:48:32,648 --> 01:48:33,983
Please let us in!
We need to get inside!

1983
01:48:33,984 --> 01:48:35,350
Oh!

1984
01:48:35,351 --> 01:48:37,653
- Oh, thank you!
- Thank you!

1985
01:48:37,654 --> 01:48:39,420
Hurry, Mr. Banks!

1986
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:40,422
What?

1987
01:48:46,596 --> 01:48:48,464
What is all this?

1988
01:48:48,465 --> 01:48:50,000
It's what
we've been looking for.

1989
01:48:52,803 --> 01:48:55,838
Three, two, one...

1990
01:48:55,839 --> 01:48:56,840
fire!

1991
01:49:01,545 --> 01:49:02,947
Mr. Binnacle...

1992
01:49:05,749 --> 01:49:09,052
Big Ben has
finally got it right.

1993
01:49:16,059 --> 01:49:17,326
<i>And this goes...</i>

1994
01:49:17,928 --> 01:49:19,427
at the top.

1995
01:49:19,428 --> 01:49:21,030
Uh...

1996
01:49:21,031 --> 01:49:23,165
What's that?
Where did this go? Uh...

1997
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:24,767
- Right there?
- No.

1998
01:49:24,768 --> 01:49:26,135
- No, there.
- This piece goes there.

1999
01:49:26,136 --> 01:49:27,903
And does it matter that
it's all cut up in bits?

2000
01:49:27,904 --> 01:49:29,572
It's still worth
something, is it?

2001
01:49:29,573 --> 01:49:31,574
It's still valid, so long as
all the pieces are there.

2002
01:49:31,575 --> 01:49:33,976
Is that so?

2003
01:49:33,977 --> 01:49:36,146
Now, Georgie, there was one
more piece, a corner piece...

2004
01:49:36,147 --> 01:49:37,479
with a lot of
signatures on it.

2005
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:38,914
Do you remember that?

2006
01:49:38,915 --> 01:49:42,551
I must have thrown it out.
I'm sorry, Father.

2007
01:49:42,552 --> 01:49:44,653
Oh,
that's all right, Georgie.

2008
01:49:44,654 --> 01:49:45,789
No, it isn't.

2009
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:51,460
I'm afraid you have
a problem, Banks.

2010
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:52,829
You see,
without those signatures,

2011
01:49:52,830 --> 01:49:54,397
you have no bank shares...

2012
01:49:55,598 --> 01:49:56,733
no house...

2013
01:49:57,801 --> 01:49:59,535
you have nothing.

2014
01:49:59,536 --> 01:50:00,870
What?

2015
01:50:00,871 --> 01:50:02,538
But he knows you have
the bank shares!

2016
01:50:02,539 --> 01:50:04,173
He's been planning this
all along!

2017
01:50:04,174 --> 01:50:05,708
Take your children
out of here, Banks.

2018
01:50:05,709 --> 01:50:07,843
I've had enough
of their lies.

2019
01:50:07,844 --> 01:50:09,646
Don't you dare
insult my children.

2020
01:50:10,947 --> 01:50:13,048
Don't you dare.

2021
01:50:13,049 --> 01:50:14,684
They are not lying,
and you know it!

2022
01:50:16,086 --> 01:50:18,454
I only wish I'd believed
them sooner!

2023
01:50:18,455 --> 01:50:21,024
You all had him pegged right
from the start, didn't you?

2024
01:50:21,025 --> 01:50:22,059
Come on.

2025
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:24,928
Take the house!

2026
01:50:24,929 --> 01:50:26,495
Go ahead.

2027
01:50:26,496 --> 01:50:28,198
I have everything
I need right here.

2028
01:50:34,038 --> 01:50:35,873
He has you there, Willie.

2029
01:50:36,641 --> 01:50:38,775
Uncle Dawes?

2030
01:50:38,776 --> 01:50:41,044
What on earth
are you doing here?

2031
01:50:41,045 --> 01:50:44,246
A little bird told me...

2032
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:47,049
that you've been trying
to cheat the Banks family...

2033
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:48,951
out of their shares
in this bank.

2034
01:50:48,952 --> 01:50:51,020
That he has.
We heard him.

2035
01:50:51,021 --> 01:50:52,888
I also hear...

2036
01:50:52,889 --> 01:50:55,024
you've been telling
the whole of London

2037
01:50:55,025 --> 01:50:57,260
that I've gone loony.

2038
01:50:57,261 --> 01:50:58,928
The only loony thing
I ever did

2039
01:50:58,929 --> 01:51:00,829
was trust you
to look after this bank!

2040
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:02,498
You can't be serious,

2041
01:51:02,499 --> 01:51:03,899
I've nearly doubled
the profits of this bank.

2042
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:07,203
Yes, by wringing it out of
the customers' pockets.

2043
01:51:07,204 --> 01:51:10,206
Their trust in us
built this bank.

2044
01:51:10,207 --> 01:51:14,144
You've squandered every
last bit of their goodwill.

2045
01:51:14,145 --> 01:51:15,545
Well, Willie...

2046
01:51:16,647 --> 01:51:19,950
I'm back, and you're out.

2047
01:51:19,951 --> 01:51:22,652
Gentlemen, would you show
my nephew to the door, please?

2048
01:51:22,653 --> 01:51:24,187
Yes, sir, Mr. Dawes.

2049
01:51:24,188 --> 01:51:26,023
Get off!

2050
01:51:27,591 --> 01:51:29,527
You're not fit
to run this bank!

2051
01:51:31,861 --> 01:51:34,230
Oh, we'll see about that!

2052
01:51:34,231 --> 01:51:36,732
I may be
circling the drain...

2053
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:39,735
but I got a few steps
left in me.

So glad to have you back,

2074
01:52:28,285 --> 01:52:30,787
Oh. Thank you, Michael.

2075
01:52:30,788 --> 01:52:33,323
By the way,
those shares of yours...

2076
01:52:33,324 --> 01:52:35,125
perfectly fine...

2077
01:52:35,126 --> 01:52:36,893
save 'em for your family.

2078
01:52:36,894 --> 01:52:39,696
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

2079
01:52:39,697 --> 01:52:42,066
I'd like to tell you
a little story.

2080
01:52:43,267 --> 01:52:45,168
Once upon a time...

2081
01:52:45,169 --> 01:52:48,172
there was a man
with a wooden leg...

2082
01:52:50,207 --> 01:52:53,710
That's not it.

2083
01:52:53,711 --> 01:52:56,380
It's about a little boy
named Michael.

2084
01:52:56,381 --> 01:52:59,683
Michael wanted to give his
tuppence to a bird lady...

2085
01:53:01,019 --> 01:53:04,621
but after
a little persuasion, hmm?

2086
01:53:04,622 --> 01:53:07,723
He decided he'd give 'em
to his father.

2087
01:53:07,724 --> 01:53:10,927
Michael's father,
your grandfather...

2088
01:53:10,928 --> 01:53:13,296
gave those tuppence
to this bank...

2089
01:53:13,297 --> 01:53:16,833
and told us to guard it well.

2090
01:53:16,834 --> 01:53:18,902
We did just that.

2091
01:53:18,903 --> 01:53:22,172
And after several quite
clever investments...

2092
01:53:22,173 --> 01:53:24,874
if I do say so myself...

2093
01:53:24,875 --> 01:53:28,845
that tuppence has grown
into quite a tidy sum.

2094
01:53:28,846 --> 01:53:30,314
Really?

2095
01:53:30,315 --> 01:53:31,848
Really, Michael.

2096
01:53:31,849 --> 01:53:35,586
In fact, enough
to pay off that loan you took.

2097
01:53:37,922 --> 01:53:40,724
The house is yours.

2098
01:53:42,027 --> 01:53:43,095
Oh!

2099
01:54:08,185 --> 01:54:10,687
What a beautiful day
to be going back home.

2100
01:54:10,688 --> 01:54:12,789
Look at them
lovely cherry blossoms.

2101
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,691
They're lovely.

2102
01:54:14,692 --> 01:54:17,194
I shall have to paint them.

2103
01:54:17,195 --> 01:54:18,728
What about you, Jane?

2104
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,030
What about me?

2105
01:54:20,031 --> 01:54:21,332
He means what about you

2106
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:23,234
and that handsome
lamplighter, Jack?

2107
01:54:23,235 --> 01:54:25,302
No! No, we're just friends.

2108
01:54:25,303 --> 01:54:26,437
- Oh, go on.
- Really.

2109
01:54:26,438 --> 01:54:27,972
Stop it, Ellen!

2110
01:54:27,973 --> 01:54:30,107
What's this?

2111
01:54:30,108 --> 01:54:32,443
The Spring Fair,
it's today! Can we go?

2112
01:54:32,444 --> 01:54:33,777
Please?

2113
01:54:33,778 --> 01:54:34,912
I don't see why not.

2114
01:54:34,913 --> 01:54:36,213
Hooray!

2115
01:54:36,214 --> 01:54:37,882
Come on,
Father, let's go!

Will you go

01:54:38,984 --> 01:54:40,317
Yes.
And you too, Jane!

2118
01:54:40,318 --> 01:54:41,919
Only if you come
with me, Ellen.

2119
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,053
What? Wouldn't be
caught dead on that thing.

02:01:09,375 --> 02:01:11,477
Yes, I suppose it must.

2233
02:01:18,117 --> 02:01:20,554
Practically perfect
in every way.

2234
02:01:36,436 --> 02:01:37,770
Welcome home, everyone.

2235
02:01:37,771 --> 02:01:39,738
It's nice to be back,
isn't it?

2236
02:01:39,739 --> 02:01:42,308
It is, it's so nice.

2237
02:01:42,309 --> 02:01:43,475
I never thought I'd feel

2238
02:01:43,476 --> 02:01:45,811
this much joy and wonder
ever again.

2239
02:01:45,812 --> 02:01:48,248
I thought that door
was closed to me forever.

2240
02:02:12,204 --> 02:02:13,439
Come on, let's go!

2241
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:14,740
Race you up the stairs!

2242
02:02:14,741 --> 02:02:15,741
No fair,
you got a head start.

2243
02:02:15,742 --> 02:02:16,843
Oh, wait for me.

2244
02:02:20,513 --> 02:02:21,615
It's time.

2245
02:02:35,462 --> 02:02:37,530
She's gone,
hasn't she, Michael?

2246
02:02:43,837 --> 02:02:45,672
Thank you, Mary Poppins.

2247
02:02:47,374 --> 02:02:48,508
Goodbye.

2248
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:03,590
I won't forget,
Mary Poppins. Promise.
