1
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:51,468
<i>My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy.</i>

2
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,975
<i>Let's see. I'm nine feet tall.
I weigh 643 pounds.</i>

3
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>Got a little bit of a temper on me.</i>

4
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,941
<i>My passion bubbles very near the surface,</i>

5
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,985
<i>I guess, not gonna lie.</i>

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,989
<i>Anyhoo, what else?</i>

7
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,784
<i>I'm a wrecker. I wreck things.
Professionally.</i>

8
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>I'm very good at what I do.
Probably the best I know.</i>

9
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,585
<i>The thing is, fixing is
the name of the game.</i>

10
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,336
<i>Literally,</i> Fix-It Felix, Jr.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,174
<i>So, yeah, naturally,</i>

12
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,011
<i>the guy with the name
Fix-It Felix is the good guy.</i>

13
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,971
<i>He's nice enough as good guys go.</i>

14
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,973
<i>Definitely fixes stuff really well.</i>

15
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>But if you've got a magic
hammer from your father,</i>

16
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,854
<i>how hard can it be?</i>

17
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>If he was a regular
contractor carpenter guy,</i>

18
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,735
<i>I guarantee you would not be able</i>

19
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,862
<i>to fix the damage that I do as quickly.</i>

20
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,866
<i>And when Felix does a good
job, he gets a medal.</i>

21
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>But are there medals
for wrecking stuff really well?</i>

22
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,039
<i>To that I say, "Ha!"</i>

23
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,751
<i>And, no, there aren't.</i>

24
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,048
<i>Thirty years I've been doing this</i>

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,925
<i>and I've seen a lot of other
games come and go.</i>

26
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,179
<i>Kind of sad. I think about all
those guys from</i> Asteroids.

27
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,640
<i>Boom! Gone.</i> Centipede?

28
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,558
<i>Who knows where that guy is, you know?</i>

29
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,645
<i>Look, a steady arcade gig
is nothing to sneeze at.</i>

30
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>I'm very lucky.</i>

31
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,316
<i>It's just, I got to say,</i>

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,943
<i>it becomes kind of hard to love your job</i>

33
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,279
<i>when no one seems
to like you for doing it.</i>

34
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,535
All clear! The arcade is closed!

35
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,204
Shoryuken!

36
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,291
Whoo! What a day!
You want to head to Tappers, Ken?

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,834
If you're buying, buddy.

38
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:52,964
Quitting time!

39
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,687
<i>I don't know.</i>

40
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,313
<i>Maybe I wouldn't be feeling this way</i>

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>if things were different after work.</i>

42
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,943
<i>But it is what it is.</i>

43
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,111
Good job, everyone!

44
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,654
<i>Felix and the Nicelanders</i>

45
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,614
<i>go hang out in their homes</i>

46
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,283
<i>which he's just fixed,
and everyone, you know...</i>

47
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,163
<i>They go to their homes, I go to mine</i>

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,125
<i>which happens to be a dump.</i>

49
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,876
<i>And when I say "a dump,"</i>

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>I don't mean like a shabby place.</i>

51
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>I mean an actual dump,</i>

52
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,133
<i>where the garbage goes</i>

53
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,511
<i>and a bunch of bricks and
smashed building parts...</i>

54
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,180
<i>That's what I call home.</i>

55
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,474
<i>I guess I can't bellyache too much.</i>

56
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,144
<i>I got my bricks, I got my stump.</i>

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,234
<i>It looks uncomfortable.
It's actually fine. I'm good.</i>

58
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,492
<i>But if I'm really honest with myself...</i>

59
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>I see Felix up there getting
patted on the back,</i>

60
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:11,501
<i>people are giving him
pie and thanking him</i>

61
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,671
<i>and so happy to see him all the time.</i>

62
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,923
Sometimes I think...

63
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,179
Man, it sure must be
nice being the good guy.

64
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,559
Nice share, Ralph.

65
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,019
As fellow bad guys,

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
we've all felt what you're feeling

67
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,022
and we've come to terms with it.

68
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,565
- Really?
- Right here.

69
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,692
I am Zangief. I am bad guy.

70
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,944
- Hi, Zangief!
- Hi, Zangief.

71
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,072
I relate to you, Ralph.
When I hit bottom,

72
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,699
I was crushing man's skull

73
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,535
like sparrow egg between my thighs.

74
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,831
And I think, "Why do you
have to be so bad, Zangief?

75
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,375
"Why can't you be more like good guy?"

76
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,045
Then I have moment of clarity.

77
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,047
If Zangief is good guy,

78
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,090
who'll crush man's skull

79
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,384
like sparrow's egg between thighs?

80
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,637
And I say, "Zangief, you are bad guy,

81
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,098
"but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy."

82
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,230
Right. I'm sorry. You lost me there.

83
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,815
- Zombie! Bad guy!
- Hi, Zombie.

84
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,233
Hi, Zombie.

85
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,778
Zangief saying labels not make you happy.

86
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,072
Good! Bad!

87
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,575
You must love you.

88
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,994
- Yeah! Inside here!
- Yes.

89
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,164
Okay. All right, I get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,332
Question, Ralph.

91
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,960
We've been asking you
to Bad-Anon for years now

92
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,129
and tonight you finally show up.

93
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,006
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,424
I just felt like coming.

95
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,846
I suppose it has something
to do with the fact that...

96
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,140
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

97
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,142
Well, happy anniversary, Ralph.

98
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,477
Thanks, Satan.

99
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,105
It's Sateen, actually.

100
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,440
Got it. But here's the thing.

101
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,862
I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

102
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,325
You can't mess with the program, Ralph.

103
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,078
You're not going Turbo, are you?

104
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,498
Turbo? No, I'm not going Turbo!
Come on, guys!

105
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,501
Is it Turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

106
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,545
Or a piece of pie every once in a while?

107
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,338
Is it Turbo to want more out of life?

108
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,798
Yes!

109
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,800
Ralph, Ralph, we get it.

110
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,844
But we can't change who we are.

111
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,178
And the sooner you accept that,

112
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,640
the better off your game
and your life will be.

113
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,935
Hey. One game at a time, Ralph.

114
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,563
Let's close out with
the Bad Guy Affirmation.

115
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,154
I'm bad, and that's good.

116
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,991
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

117
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,368
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

118
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,413
Okay, gang, see you next week.

119
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,415
Listen, I can't do snacks next week.

120
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,042
Hang in there, Ralph.

121
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,544
Hey, Zombie, don't forget your hatchets.

122
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,712
There you go.

123
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,109
Step aside, sir. Random security check.

124
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,277
Random my behind! You always stop me.

125
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,613
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

126
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,407
- Name?
- Lara Croft.

127
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,075
- Name?
- Wreck-It Ralph!

128
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,576
And where are you coming from?

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,078
<i>Pac-Man.</i>

130
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,579
Did you bring any fruit with you?

131
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,123
No! No. No fruit.

132
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,582
Okay, then. Where are you heading?

133
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,667
<i>Fix-It Felix Jr.</i>

134
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,585
- Anything to declare?
- I hate you.

135
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,421
I get that a lot. Proceed.

136
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,343
Bad guy coming!

137
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>If you leave your game,</i>

138
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,932
<i>stay safe, stay alert,</i>

139
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,393
<i>and whatever you do, don't die.</i>

140
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,645
<i>Because if you die outside your own game</i>

141
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,272
<i>you don't regenerate.</i>

142
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,107
<i>Ever. Game over.</i>

143
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,326
Here you go, buddy.

144
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,497
It's fresh. Straight from Pac-Man's.

145
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,124
Hang in there, guys.

146
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,418
Name?

147
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,830
"Happy 30th Anniversary"?

148
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,249
They're having a party without me.

149
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,755
Pac-Man? They invited Pac-Man?

150
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,257
That cherry-chasing dot-muncher

151
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,759
isn't even part of this game!

152
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,677
Great party, Felix.

153
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,096
Why, thank you, friend.

154
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,056
Felix. You're needed on the dance floor!

155
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,024
Fix-It Felix! Fix-It Felix!

156
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,860
I'll bet that's Mario.

157
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,279
Fashionably late, per the norm.

158
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,906
I'll get it, Felix.

159
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,746
It's Ralph!

160
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,041
- He'll wreck the party!
- Hide the stemware!

161
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,084
Get rid of him, Felix.

162
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,878
Oh, right. I'll go talk to him.

163
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,547
Carry on, everyone.

164
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,467
Ralph, can I help you?

165
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,386
Hey, Felix. Just wanted to check on you.

166
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,429
I saw a big explosion

167
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,890
or something go over the building there.

168
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,643
Those were just fireworks.

169
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,145
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

170
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,938
Somebody's birthday, or...

171
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:51,276
Well, it's more of an anniversary.

172
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,987
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

173
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,030
What? Is that today?

174
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,240
I know!

175
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm such a dummy with dates.

176
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,119
Anyway, congratulations.

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,414
Thank you, Ralph. And to you, too.

178
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,339
Just a heads-up, Felix.

179
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,465
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

180
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,385
- Hey, Glen.
- Ralph.

181
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,514
Cake? Heard about this cake stuff.

182
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,807
Never had it.

183
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,267
No one ever seems to throw it out

184
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,435
so it never ends up in the dump.

185
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,271
I never actually tasted it.

186
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,107
I've always wanted to try cake.

187
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,943
I don't suppose you'd like to

188
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,612
come in and have a slice, would you?

189
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,114
Hey-o, everybody!

190
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,581
I'm okay. I'm okay. Fit as a fiddle.

191
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,460
- Now, you all know Ralph.
- Evening.

192
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:55,048
Evening, Nell, Lucy, Don, Dana...

193
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,966
- Deanna.
- Big Gene!

194
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,426
Why is he here?

195
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,678
He's just here for a slice of cake.

196
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,555
And I'm a big part of the game,

197
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,140
technically speaking.

198
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,975
Why are you here, Gene?

199
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,518
Oh, look! The cake!

200
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,983
Well, I'll be dipped.
You've really outdone yourself, Mary.

201
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,486
Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.

202
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,948
Each apartment is everyone's
favorite flavor.

203
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,658
Norwood's is red velvet.

204
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,742
Guilty!

205
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,329
And lemon for Lucy, rum cake for Gene,

206
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,872
- and for Felix...
- Hey, Mary.

207
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,502
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

208
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,505
Oh. Chocolate.

209
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,091
I've never been real fond of chocolate.

210
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,009
Well, I did not know that.

211
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,344
One other little thing.

212
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,931
I hate to be picky, but this
angry little guy here...

213
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,016
- My cake!
- ...might be a lot happier

214
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,477
if you put him up here
with everyone else.

215
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,688
See that? Look at that smile.

216
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,856
No, no. You see, Ralph,

217
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,025
there's no room for you up here.

218
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,612
What about this? We can make room.

219
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,407
Here. We could take turns. Easy.

220
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,368
How about we just eat the cake?

221
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,870
Hang on. Felix needs to be on the roof

222
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,872
because he's about to get his medal!

223
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,250
Then how about we just take that medal

224
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,710
and give it to Ralph for once?

225
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,378
Would that be the end of the world, Gene?

226
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,213
Now you're just being ridiculous.

227
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,048
Only good guys win medals,

228
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,634
and you, sir, are no good guy.

229
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,219
I could be a good guy if I wanted to,

230
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,387
and I could win a medal!

231
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,348
And when you do, come and talk to us.

232
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,143
Then would you finally let me be
on top of the cake with you guys?

233
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,269
If you won a medal,

234
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,271
we'd let you live up here
in the penthouse!

235
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,315
But it will never happen

236
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,484
because you're just the bad
guy who wrecks the building.

237
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,153
No, I'm not.

238
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,404
Yes, you are!

239
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,156
No, I'm not!

240
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,751
Yes, you are.

241
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,921
All right, Gene. You know what?

242
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,506
I'm going to win a medal.

243
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,092
Oh, I am going to win a medal!

244
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,095
The shiniest medal this
place has ever seen!

245
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,598
A medal that will be so good

246
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,684
that it will make Felix's
medals wet their pants!

247
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,355
And good night! Thank you for the party.

248
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,107
- Is he serious?
- Oh, please!

249
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,360
Where's a bad guy going to win a medal?

250
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,487
Of course he's not serious.

251
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,990
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

252
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,700
That's why I came straight here, Tapper.

253
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,285
You've never given me a bum steer.

254
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,122
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

255
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,458
I don't think such a game exists, Ralph.

256
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,169
Oh, come on. You know people.
There's got to be...

257
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,462
Tapper, I need a root beer.

258
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,047
Coming! Hold that thought.

259
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,806
Okay. As you were saying.

260
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,934
I was saying, I can't
spend another 30 years

261
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,352
living alone in the garbage.

262
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,270
I'm not going back without a medal.

263
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,855
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

264
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,274
Maybe somebody left a medal here.

265
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,610
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

266
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,363
Okay, let's see what we got here.

267
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,657
Go on, get out of here.

268
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,619
Mushroom? No.

269
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,247
What is this? No.

270
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,292
Come on, Zangief! Gross.

271
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,004
What am I doing?

272
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,550
- Hey, excuse you!
- We are humanity's last hope.

273
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,386
Our mission? Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

274
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,722
We are humanity's last hope.

275
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,434
You okay there, space cadet?

276
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,352
We've only been plugged in a week

277
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,897
and every day it's,
"Climb the building, then fight bugs.

278
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,358
"Climb the building, fight more bugs!"

279
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,693
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

280
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,778
Easy on the overalls, spaceman.

281
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,155
It's tough all over, all right?

282
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,074
And all for what? A lousy medal?

283
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,869
Medal? You win a medal?

284
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,745
Yeah, Medal of Heroes.

285
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,747
Is it shiny?

286
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,499
Pretty shiny.

287
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,627
- And it says "hero" on it?
- Oh, yeah.

288
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,046
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

289
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,798
- And fighting bugs!
- Right, bugs.

290
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,426
Is there any chance I could
go with you to your game

291
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,678
and maybe get one of those medals?

292
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,597
- Negatory.
- Does that mean maybe?

293
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,891
No! Look, only the bravest

294
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,894
and the best serve in our corps.

295
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,020
Bug!

296
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,032
We are humanity's last hope.

297
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,291
<i>Attention! The arcade
will open in five minutes.</i>

298
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,293
<i>Please report to your games.</i>

299
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,006
I can't feel my legs.
What is all this stuff?

300
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,551
Smells like Ralph in here.

301
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,639
Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

302
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,599
Hero's something.

303
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:57,975
<i>Duty. Hero's Duty.</i>

304
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,268
There it is.

305
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,400
Sorry, Q*bert. It's me, Ralph.

306
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,699
The wall.

307
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,876
Morning, kids. Come on in.

308
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,337
Good to see you. Good to see you.
You, too, little fella.

309
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,844
<i>Quarter alert! Quarter alert!</i>

310
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:34,929
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

311
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,765
Ooh! Sweet golden medal!

312
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,314
<i>On a planet with no name</i>

313
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,484
<i>a top-secret experiment
has gone horribly wrong.</i>

314
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,613
<i>You are humanity's last hope.</i>

315
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,118
Rooting-tooting, ready for shooting!

316
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,619
All right.

317
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,622
Now listen up, because I'm
only going to say this once.

318
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,292
Fear is a four-letter word, ladies.

319
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,919
If you want to go pee-pee
in your big-boy slacks,

320
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,296
keep it to yourself.

321
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,798
It's make your mamas proud time!

322
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,133
I love my mama!

323
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,884
Heads up! First-person shooter,

324
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,052
coming through!

325
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,637
Ooh, robot!

326
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,059
<i>Game play in three, two, one.</i>

327
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,063
<i>We are humanity's last hope.</i>

328
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,148
<i>Our mission?</i>

329
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,067
Destroy all Cy-Bugs.

330
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,403
You ready, rookie? Let's find out.

331
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,532
Sweet Mother Hubbard!

332
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,122
No, no, no! Wait a second!

333
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,670
Cy-Bug, twelve o'clock. Take it, newbie.

334
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,759
No, no! Wait, wait!

335
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,306
Watch it, rookie! These monsters
become what they eat.

336
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,518
My gun! Give me that back.

337
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,442
Shoot the eggs before they hatch!

338
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,568
Oh, no!

339
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,195
Something's coming out of their bottom!

340
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,199
<i>- Oh, gross!
- Markowski!</i>

341
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,867
<i>Get back in formation!</i>

342
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,827
<i>All right, ladies,</i>

343
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,455
<i>the kitten whispers and
tickle fights stop now.</i>

344
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,290
The entrance to the lab
is straight ahead.

345
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,167
- I'll meet you guys inside!
- No!

346
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,419
Sanctuary! Sanctuary!

347
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,216
I thought this was going
to be like <i>Centipede</i>!

348
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,427
When did video games become
so violent and scary?

349
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,805
<i>Please, get me out of here!</i>

350
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
Take her!

351
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,854
What a rip-off!

352
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,983
Get off me! It's game over. Stop it!

353
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,697
Beacon up!

354
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,661
Cease fire! Cease fire!

355
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,169
<i>Attention! Return to start positions.</i>

356
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,004
<i>Return to start positions.</i>

357
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,384
Here, let me help you. Sorry about that.

358
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,344
Yeah, you must be upset.

359
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,263
- Markowski.
- Who?

360
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,266
Yeah, me. I'm Markowski.

361
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,977
What's the first rule of <i>Hero's Duty</i>?

362
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,604
No cuts, no butts, no coconuts?

363
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,734
Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

364
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,653
Our job is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

365
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,322
so they can get a medal, and that's it!

366
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,450
So stick to the program, soldier!

367
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,534
Right. Right. Aye, aye.

368
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,244
<i>Quarter alert! Quarter alert!</i>

369
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,080
All right, pussy willows.
Back to start positions!

370
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,502
Yeah, right. No way I'm
going through that again.

371
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,506
So that's where they keep the medal, huh?

372
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,346
"New racers daily."

373
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,557
Sweet! I got next game.

374
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,683
Go away, kid!

375
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,351
We're going to play all
nine of today's racers!

376
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,436
Yeah!

377
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,772
Sorry.

378
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
Where's the wrecking guy?

379
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,458
Where's Ralph? He should
be wrecking the building.

380
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,627
Stick with the program.

381
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,879
<i>Fix it, Felix!</i>

382
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,224
Ralph! Quarter alert! Game on!

383
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,316
Do something, Felix!

384
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,027
Just act natural. I'll fix it.

385
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,908
Ralph! Ralph!

386
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,201
What the...

387
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,453
Ralph? Ralph!

388
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh, my land! Where is he?

389
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,002
Mr. Litwak!

390
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,629
What's the trouble, sweetheart?

391
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,089
The game's busted.

392
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,759
<i>I can fix it! I can fix it!</i>

393
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,885
Oh, boy.

394
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,972
Looks like the game's gone
cuckoo, like my nana.

395
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,808
Sorry, sweetie. Here's your quarter back.

396
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,226
But what about the game?

397
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,228
I'll have someone look at it tomorrow...

398
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,438
But if he can't fix it, it might be time

399
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,691
to put old Ralph and
Felix out to pasture.

400
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,025
Like my nana.

401
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:54,206
Ladies and gentlemen, we're out of order.

402
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,084
Sweet mercy!
Without Ralph, we're doomed!

403
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,086
They're going to pull our plug!

404
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,008
Okay, everybody, calm down.

405
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,093
Ralph probably fell asleep

406
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,720
in the washroom of Tapper's again.

407
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,306
See? There he is now.

408
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,856
Why, it's Q*bert.
What brings you here, neighbor?

409
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,192
What's he saying, Felix?

410
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,112
Stand by. My Q*bert-ese is a little rusty.

411
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,004
Ralph's gone Turbo!

412
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,604
Shiny.

413
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,399
<i>Attention! The arcade is now closed.</i>

414
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,901
Did you get a load of Markowski?

415
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,986
Shut your chew holes.

416
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:07,905
Cy-Bug.

417
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,249
Taste it!

418
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,342
Slick Tiddlywinking, pint-size.

419
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,010
I'm Fix-It Felix, Jr., ma'am.

420
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,638
From the game <i>Fix-It Felix, Jr.</i>

421
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,058
Jiminey jaminey!

422
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,729
Look at that high definition. Your face!

423
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,232
It's amazing!

424
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,819
Flattery don't charge these
batteries, civilian.

425
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,237
Now, state your business.

426
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm looking for my colleague,
Wreck-it Ralph?

427
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,033
Never heard of him.

428
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,411
Well, Q*bert saw him come in here.

429
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,039
Impossible. Nothing gets past me.

430
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,209
That came from the tower.

431
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,272
Nice eggs. Nice eggs!

432
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,066
Okay. That was easy.

433
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,948
<i>Congratulations, soldier.</i>

434
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,242
<i>It is my honor to bestow upon you</i>

435
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,411
<i>the Medal of Heroes.</i>

436
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,164
Wow!

437
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,637
No way!

438
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,805
<i>Ten-hut!</i>

439
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,516
Wow!

440
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,855
<i>History will long revere your
courage and sacrifice.</i>

441
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,065
Well, thank you!

442
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,983
<i>You have etched in the rock of virtue</i>

443
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,902
<i>a legacy beyond compare.</i>

444
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,529
Thanks, guys. At ease!

445
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,574
<i>You are the universe's greatest hero.</i>

446
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,164
<i>The living embodiment
of all this corps represents.</i>

447
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,795
<i>Bravery. Integrity.
Grace under pressure.</i>

448
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,589
<i>And above all, dignity.</i>

449
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,716
<i>Escape pod activated.</i>

450
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,304
Get off my face!

451
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,520
Incoming!

452
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,527
- Ralph!
- Cy-Bug!

453
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
Oh, no!

454
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,749
<i>Sayonara</i>, sucker!

455
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,345
"Sugar Rush"?

456
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,604
Oh, no!

457
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,440
This is that candy go-cart game

458
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,025
over by the Whac-A-Mole.

459
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,735
I got to get out of here.

460
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,778
Oh, no! My medal!

461
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,534
No, no, no, no, my medal!

462
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,915
No, no, my medal!

463
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,395
Hi, mister.

464
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,398
Hello.

465
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:59,112
Man, you scared me, kid.
I nearly soiled myself.

466
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,822
What's your name?

467
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,574
Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph.

468
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,493
You're not from here, are you?

469
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,996
No, well, yeah. I mean,
not from right in this area.

470
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,373
I'm just doing some work here.

471
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,540
What kind of work?

472
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,709
Some routine candy tree trimming.

473
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,169
You probably want to stand back.

474
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,171
In fact, this whole area

475
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,631
is technically closed
while we're trimming.

476
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,675
- Who's "we"?
- Candy tree department.

477
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,593
Where is everybody else?

478
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,095
It's just me today.

479
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,555
So you just meant like the royal "we"?

480
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,683
Yep. That's right.

481
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,559
Hey, are you a hobo?

482
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,772
No. I'm not a hobo, but I am busy.

483
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,191
Okay? So you go home.

484
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,068
What's that? Didn't hear you.

485
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,362
Your breath is so bad
it made my ears numb.

486
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,613
Listen, I tried to be nice.

487
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,073
I tried to be nice.

488
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,701
- You're mimicking me.
- You're mimicking me!

489
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,661
- Okay.
- Okay.

490
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,247
That is rude, and this
conversation is over.

491
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,082
And this conversation is over.

492
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,044
I wouldn't grab that branch if I were you.

493
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,921
I'm from the candy tree
department, so I know what...

494
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,506
It's a double stripe.

495
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,720
Double stripes break.

496
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,306
Why are your hands so freakishly big?

497
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,267
I don't know. Why are you
so freakishly annoying?

498
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,894
Why are you so freakishly...

499
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,397
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
A gold coin!

500
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,065
Don't even think about it.
That is mine.

501
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,567
- Race you for it!
- Hey!

502
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,361
I don't have to race for it
because it's mine!

503
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,447
- Double stripe!
- Come back here!

504
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,699
- The winner!
- Give it back! Give it!

505
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,787
Double stripe.

506
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,709
Thank you!

507
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,171
Wait! Let me talk to you for one second.

508
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,423
Okay. Here's the thing.

509
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,050
I'm not from the candy tree department.

510
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,928
Lying to a child. Shame on you, Ralph.

511
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,015
But I wasn't lying about the medal.
That is my medal!

512
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,476
That's why I was climbing the tree.
It's mine!

513
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,061
It's precious to me.

514
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,022
That thing is my ticket to a better life.

515
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,316
Yeah, well, now it's my ticket.

516
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,318
- What the...
- See you, chump!

517
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,029
Come back! I'll find you!

518
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,864
I will find you!

519
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,990
Double stripe!

520
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,868
Nowhere to hide!

521
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,540
Yeah, he banged around in here
like some kind of hot shot,

522
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,168
then he went barreling down
into that sweet little game

523
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,961
like a crazy person.

524
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,671
<i>"Sugar Rush."</i>

525
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,757
Cy-Bugs would chew up that game

526
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,511
faster than a chicken hawk
in a coop of crippled roosters.

527
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,763
- What was that, now?
- What are you, thick?

528
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,973
There was a Cy-Bug on that shuttle!

529
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,102
Do you even know what a Cy-Bug is?

530
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,062
I can't say that I do, ma'am.

531
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,147
Cy-Bugs are like a virus.

532
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,732
They don't know they're in a game.

533
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,819
All they know is eat, kill, multiply.

534
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,654
Without a beacon to stop them,

535
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,656
they'll consume <i>Sugar Rush</i>.

536
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,990
But do you think they'll stop there?

537
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,575
- Yes!
- Wrong!

538
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,537
Viruses do not stop!

539
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,248
Once those Cy-Bugs finish off <i>Sugar Rush</i>,

540
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,418
they'll invade every other
game until this arcade

541
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:04,339
is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

542
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,134
Kohut! My cruiser.

543
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,098
Jeepers. Is she always this intense?

544
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,891
It's not her fault.

545
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:18,061
She's programmed with the most
tragic back-story ever.

546
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,480
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check...

547
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,775
<i>Her wedding day.</i>

548
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,501
Wait, ma'am! I'm going with you.

549
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,503
Like fun you are, short stack.

550
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,089
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

551
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,842
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

552
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,887
And it is my job to fix
what Ralph wrecks.

553
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,722
And I cannot ask you

554
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,849
to risk your life cleaning up his mess.

555
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,978
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.

556
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,769
<i>Citizens of Sugar Rush...</i>

557
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,646
Just in time.

558
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:48,276
<i>...all hail our rightful ruler, King Candy.</i>

559
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,655
<i>Hello, my royal subjects!</i>

560
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,115
<i>Have some candy!</i>

561
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>Thank you for that stirring
introduction, Sour Bill.</i>

562
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,875
<i>And thank you to today's avatars.</i>

563
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,920
<i>It was a wonderful day of racing. It was.</i>

564
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,713
<i>But now the arcade is closed,</i>

565
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,049
<i>so it's time to wipe the slate clean</i>

566
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,635
<i>and race to decide our new roster.</i>

567
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,138
<i>The first nine racers
across that finish line</i>

568
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,894
<i>will represent Sugar Rush
as tomorrow's avatars!</i>

569
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,354
Race! Race! Race!

570
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,815
<i>Okay, calm down.</i>

571
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,819
<i>Listen! This event is pay-to-play.
We all know this.</i>

572
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,488
<i>The fee to compete is one gold coin</i>

573
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,615
<i>from your previous winnings,</i>

574
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,451
<i>if you've ever won, which I have.</i>

575
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,370
<i>Let me go first!</i>

576
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,460
<i>King Candy!</i>

577
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,845
<i>Taffyta Muttonfudge!</i>

578
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,013
Stay sweet!

579
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,683
<i>Adorabeezle Winterpop.</i>

580
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,269
<i>Gloyd Orangeboar!</i>

581
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,025
Little stealer! Wait till I catch that brat.

582
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,361
<i>Minty Zaki. Snowanna Rainbeau.</i>

583
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,282
<i>Rancis Fluggerbutter.
Jubileena Bing-Bing.</i>

584
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,076
<i>Swizzle Malarkey.</i>

585
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,579
<i>Candlehead.</i>

586
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,422
Sour Bill, who's that last one?

587
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,178
<i>Vanellope von Schweetz!</i>

588
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,430
Yippee! I'm in the race!

589
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,598
<i>Vanellope?</i>

590
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,476
The Glitch!

591
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,271
<i>Now, now!</i>

592
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,858
<i>Everything is all right! Security!</i>

593
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,193
Come here, kid!

594
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,695
We're not going to hurt you,
you little freak!

595
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,157
Get back here!

596
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,450
Slow down! Slow down a little bit.

597
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,375
You! Give me back my medal right now!

598
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,959
- Ah, boy!
- Go!

599
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,544
<i>What is that?</i>

600
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,463
Come on! Go! Roll!

601
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,228
<i>Careful! What are you doing?</i>

602
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,155
Come back here!

603
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,867
I can't move!

604
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,494
Now we got him!

605
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,247
Oh, good, the cops. She went that way!

606
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,873
- Hold still!
- Take that!

607
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:49,999
What are you doing?

608
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,543
<i>Okay, folks.</i>

609
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,504
<i>Calm down! Everything's all right.</i>

610
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,715
<i>The monster's been caught!</i>

611
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,800
<i>We'll repair all the damage.</i>

612
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,637
<i>Don't worry. We will have our
race before the arcade opens.</i>

613
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,433
And I'm in it. Yes!

614
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,732
There's no way that I am
racing with a glitch.

615
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,650
Rancis, Candlehead, come on.

616
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,447
Sour Bill, that glitch cannot
be allowed to race!

617
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,741
And bring that thing to my castle.

618
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,576
Guys! She took...

619
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,376
<i>Or-e-oh
Oreo!</i>

620
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,503
<i>Or-e-oh</i>

621
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,809
Sour Bill, de-taffify this monster

622
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,644
so we can see what we're up against here.

623
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,896
Mm-kay.

624
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,817
Milk my duds! It's Wreck-It Ralph?

625
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,904
Yeah. Who are you, the guy
that makes the donuts?

626
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,032
Please. No. I'm King Candy!

627
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,534
I see you're a fan of pink.

628
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,870
Salmon. Salmon, that's obviously...

629
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,580
What are you doing here?

630
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:14,876
Look, Your Candiness, this is
just a big misunderstanding.

631
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,586
Just get me out of this cupcake,

632
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,713
I'll get my medal, and
I'll be out of your way.

633
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,592
Your medal? Bad guys don't win medals.

634
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,219
Well, this one did.

635
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,221
I earned it over in <i>Hero's Duty</i>.

636
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,388
You game-jumped?

637
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,058
Ralph, you're not going Turbo, are you?

638
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,518
What? No, no.

639
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,146
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

640
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,690
and take over my game,
you've got another thing coming!

641
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,484
Easy, Your Puffiness.

642
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,236
It's not my fault one of your children

643
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,112
of the candy corn stole my medal.

644
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,448
"Children of the candy corn"? Who'd...

645
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,200
The Glitch!

646
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,702
The coin she used to buy
her way into the race.

647
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,787
That was your medal?

648
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,122
She did what? I need that back!

649
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,042
Well, I'm afraid I can't help you.
It's gone, you know.

650
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,545
It's nothing but code now.

651
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,714
It will stay that way until
someone wins the cup

652
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,091
at the end of the race.

653
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,468
Maybe I'll have to have a little talk

654
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,719
with the winner then.

655
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,638
Is that a threat I smell?

656
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,351
Beyond the halitosis you
so obviously suffer from.

657
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,938
Listen, Nilly-Wafer, I'm not
leaving without my medal!

658
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,481
Yes, you are.

659
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,484
Wynnchel, Duncan, get him
out of that cupcake

660
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,361
and on the first train back home.

661
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,780
If I ever see you here again,
Wreck-It Ralph,

662
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,491
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

663
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:29,701
Fungeon?

664
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,537
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

665
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,247
It's the...

666
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,751
Never mind! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

667
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,630
Goodbye, Wreck-it Ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.

668
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,303
This thing is hard as a rock.

669
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,429
I can see that.

670
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,930
- Get the tools.
- What tools?

671
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,473
Quiet, you!

672
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,560
What? No!

673
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,353
- Take it easy, big boy!
- Stay away from me!

674
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,521
He's getting away!

675
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,987
Quick! Call out the Devil Dogs.

676
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,213
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

677
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,009
I got to get my medal back.

678
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,682
The pot goes to the winning racer!

679
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,851
Hey, kids!
Can I talk to you for a second?

680
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,364
Hello, fellow racers!

681
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,408
It's that little crumb snatcher.

682
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,203
Candlehead, Taffyta, Rancis,
you're looking well.

683
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,872
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

684
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,875
Well, here it is, the Lickety-Split!

685
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,044
Sheesh. Looks like she built it herself.

686
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,379
I built it myself.

687
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,090
Fastest pedal-power
west of the Whac-A-Mole.

688
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,341
Check her out.

689
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:17,058
Vanellope, it's so... You.

690
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,104
But you have to back out
of the race. Yeah.

691
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,855
No, I don't,

692
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,692
because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

693
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,944
So, yeah, I'm definitely racing.

694
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,947
Yeah, well, King Candy
says glitches can't race.

695
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:34,534
I'm not a glitch, Taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

696
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,577
The rules are there
for a reason, Vanellope.

697
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,539
To protect us. Say I'm you.

698
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,375
I'm in my weird little car and I'm driving

699
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,044
and I actually feel kind of cool for once.

700
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,130
And then, all of a sudden, oh, no.

701
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,716
I'm glitching!

702
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,175
- Hey!
- See?

703
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,302
You're an accident just
waiting to happen.

704
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,389
Oh, no! I glitched, too!

705
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,766
Uncool.

706
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,602
Stop it! Stop! You're breaking it!

707
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,147
Please!

708
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,566
I just want to race like you guys.

709
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,111
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

710
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,280
And that's all you'll ever be!

711
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,950
Hey! Leave her alone!

712
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,622
Let's get out of here!

713
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,337
Scram, you rotten little cavities!

714
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,964
Before I throw you in the mud!

715
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,181
What are you looking at?

716
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,768
You're welcome, you rotten little thief.

717
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:45,146
I'm not a thief!
I just borrowed your stupid coin.

718
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,940
I was going to give it back to you
as soon as I won the race.

719
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,318
It's not a coin. It is a medal.

720
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,361
Coin, medal, whatever.

721
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,156
Just go back to your own dumb
game and win another one.

722
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,575
I can't. I didn't win it in my game.

723
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,327
I won it in <i>Hero's Duty</i>.

724
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,496
<i>Hero's Doodie?</i>

725
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,541
It's not that kind of duty.

726
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,710
I bet you really got
to watch where you step

727
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,046
in a game called <i>Hero's Doodie</i>!

728
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,716
What did you win the medal for, wiping?

729
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,346
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

730
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:19,847
- Listen!
- One more, one more.

731
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,350
Why did the hero flush the toilet?

732
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,520
- Say "why."
- Why?

733
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,688
Because it was his doodie!

734
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,607
How dare you insult <i>Hero's Duty</i>?

735
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,858
You little guttersnipe!

736
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,401
I earned that medal

737
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,862
and you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

738
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,823
Well, unless you've got a go-cart

739
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,658
hidden in the fat folds of your neck,

740
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,159
I can't help you!

741
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,251
What a moron.

742
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,212
Hey, genius! It's a jawbreaker.

743
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,713
You're never going to break...

744
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:01,389
Enjoy your little tantrum, diaper baby?

745
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,723
Leave me alone.

746
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:07,061
Look, you want that medal, right?
And I want to race.

747
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,896
So here's what I'm thinking.

748
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:12,275
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

749
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,403
And I'll win the race and get
you back your medal.

750
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,114
You want me to help you?

751
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,575
All you got to do is break
something for me.

752
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,411
Come on. What do you say, friend?

753
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,121
We are not friends.

754
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,292
Come on, pal. You son of a gun.

755
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,794
Come on, buddy. Let's shake on it.

756
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,297
Come on, chumbo.

757
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,883
Ralph, my man. My main man.

758
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,551
Hey!

759
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,971
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

760
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,558
You better win.

761
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,062
Well, I'll say this much,

762
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,607
they don't call your friend
"Wreck-It" for nothing.

763
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,359
There's the shuttle.

764
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,072
Is he in there?

765
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,117
Nope. Lucky for him.

766
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,786
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

767
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,456
No Cy-Bug, either.

768
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,251
Got to find it before it lays its filthy eggs.

769
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:14,837
It came this way,

770
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,631
but the sugar particles in the atmosphere

771
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,132
are jamming my sensor.

772
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,634
Can't get a read on it.

773
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,094
So what is it with this Wreck-It joker?

774
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,304
Why did he go AWOL?

775
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,931
I wish I knew, ma'am.

776
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,808
He was acting all squirrelly last night...

777
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,478
Going on about cake and medals...

778
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,522
But I never thought he'd go Turbo.

779
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,857
"Go Turbo"?

780
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,777
That's right, you guys
just got plugged in.

781
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,322
Well, back when the arcade first opened,

782
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,283
Turbo Time <i>was by far
the most popular game.</i>

783
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,786
<i>- And Turbo...
- Turbo-tastic!</i>

784
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,497
<i>- He loved the attention.
- Turbo-tastic!</i>

785
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,541
<i>So, when</i> RoadBlasters <i>got plugged in</i>

786
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,126
<i>and stole Turbo's thunder...</i>

787
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,670
New game. All right!

788
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,672
<i>Boy, was he jealous.</i>

789
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,176
<i>So jealous that he abandoned his game</i>

790
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,844
<i>and tried to take over the new one.</i>

791
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,138
These are the greatest
graphics I've ever seen!

792
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,348
<i>Turbo-tastic!</i>

793
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,185
Hey. Is that... That looks like Turbo.

794
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,313
What's Turbo doing in this game?
Aw, come on!

795
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,898
Mr. Litwak!

796
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:20,653
<i>Turbo ended up putting
both games and himself</i>

797
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:24,031
<i>out of order, for good.</i>

798
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,243
Yes, the selfish man is like a mangy dog

799
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,245
chasing a cautionary tale.

800
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,746
I know, right?

801
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,499
That's why I have to get Ralph home

802
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,710
or the same thing's gonna
happen to my game.

803
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,841
What is this?

804
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,303
- "Nesquik Sand"?
- Quicksand?

805
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:48,222
I'll hop out and grab you
one of those vines.

806
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:57,106
I can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

807
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,399
We're going to drown here.

808
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,942
Stop thrashing. Stop moving.

809
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,110
You're making us sink faster.

810
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,236
We're going to die!

811
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,779
Get ahold of yourself!

812
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,703
The vines. They're Laffy Taffy.

813
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,205
They're attracted to whatever
makes them laugh.

814
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,749
Here, hit me again.

815
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,088
That's not funny enough. Harder!

816
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,798
Look, you're a nice guy. I can't...

817
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,593
No, ma'am! The arcade is depending on us.

818
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,429
Now do your duty. That's an ord...

819
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,933
It's working! Hit me again.

820
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,894
Your eye.

821
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,938
I can fix it. Now...

822
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,942
San Fran-tastic! Again!

823
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,278
You mean business!

824
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,281
Yikes on bikes!

825
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,078
Wow! We're... killing... them!

826
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,455
Comedy gold!

827
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,316
All right, enough with the goo-goo eyes.

828
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,068
We've got work to do. Let's go.

829
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,489
We lost the Cy-Bug.

830
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,449
Come on. We'll get a better
view from the air.

831
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,159
You think you can fix that shuttle?

832
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,286
Can do.

833
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,439
All right, do your thing, knuckles.
Bust it open!

834
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,442
What's this?
You're a full-on criminal, aren't you?

835
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,360
Hey, we shook on it.

836
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,824
Thank you, Jeeves.

837
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,036
What is this place? Where are the carts?

838
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,329
You gotta make one.

839
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,539
What? No, no.

840
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,541
Look, kid, bad idea. Trust me.

841
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,710
I don't make things. I break things.

842
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,879
Well, it looks like you're going
to be stepping outside

843
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,380
your comfort zone, then, Gladys.

844
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,174
This is a good one!

845
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,303
<i>Welcome to the bakery! Let's bake a kart!</i>

846
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,971
What is this, another game?

847
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,306
Yeah, well, it's a mini-game.

848
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,016
<i>You have one minute to win it.</i>

849
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,476
- What?
- Come on, Ralph!

850
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,394
<i>Go! Mixing.</i>

851
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,146
<i>Put the ingredients in the bowl</i>

852
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,689
<i>and throw away the trash.</i>

853
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,024
Hairbrush. No!

854
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,151
Underpants. No, no!

855
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,736
You're getting all the wrong stuff, kid.

856
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,529
I'm trying!

857
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:53,908
Let me up there. I'll do it. No. Yes.

858
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,744
Gross. Milk. Yes, yes, yes.

859
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,038
<i>Batter up!</i>

860
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,587
Come on! No sleeping on the job!

861
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,507
<i>Baking! Pump up the heat</i>

862
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,550
<i>and hold the perfect temperature.</i>

863
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,219
Ralph, a little help here?

864
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,345
I'm on it.

865
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,266
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

866
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,353
Okay, good. Little more.

867
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,606
Yeah, that's it! Hold it, hold it, hold it.

868
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,945
Yes! Come on. Get up, Ralph!
Fifteen seconds!

869
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,696
- <i>Decorating!</i>
- Wheels first.

870
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,114
- How many?
- Four, doy!

871
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,282
Got it.

872
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,869
Now frosting. A buttload of frosting!

873
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:39,954
No problem.

874
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,302
<i>Time's up! Congratulations.</i>

875
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,347
<i>You did it, and here's your cart!</i>

876
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:12,570
Look, kid... I tried to warn you.

877
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,656
I can't make things. I just break...

878
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,241
I love it.

879
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,826
You do?

880
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,494
I love it.

881
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,663
I love it! I love it! I love it!

882
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,498
Look, it's got a real engine!

883
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,500
And look at these wheels.

884
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,671
I love it! I finally have a real cart!

885
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:35,342
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

886
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,971
Cream puffs.

887
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,022
This is Beard Papa.

888
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,858
The Glitch is in the bakery!
Get me King Candy!

889
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,115
What? You have teeth?

890
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,534
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

891
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:04,496
I'm not smiling. I was...
I'm gassy, okay?

892
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,543
Hold it right there, Glitch!

893
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,712
And Wreck-It Ralph?

894
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,841
Start the cart! Start the cart!

895
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,177
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

896
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:22,765
I don't know how to drive a real cart.

897
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,224
You don't what?

898
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:25,726
Are you hurt, Sire?

899
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,063
No, he just glazed me. Get them!

900
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,939
Gangway!

901
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,030
Stop, in the name of the king! That's me!

902
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,078
Get off the road!

903
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,293
Head for Diet Cola Mountain!

904
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,007
- Drive into the wall!
- What?

905
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,843
Right there, between the two
sugar-free lollipops!

906
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,096
- Are you crazy?
- Just do it!

907
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,528
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

908
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:22,241
Find that glitch! Destroy that cart!

909
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,702
She can't be allowed to race!

910
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,377
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

911
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,254
Well, no, not technically.

912
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,089
- I just thought that...
- What did you think?

913
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,259
"I'll just magically win the race

914
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,802
"just because I really want to!"

915
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,263
Look, wise guy. I know I'm a racer.

916
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,306
I can feel it in my code.

917
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,894
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

918
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,565
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

919
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,691
The big whoop?

920
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,152
Well, this may come as a shock
to you, but in my game,

921
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,571
I'm the bad guy and
I live in the garbage.

922
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,698
- Cool.
- No. Not cool.

923
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,617
Unhygienic and lonely and boring.

924
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,038
And that crummy medal was
going to change all that.

925
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,082
I go home with that baby around my neck

926
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,168
and I'll get a penthouse. Pies.

927
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,795
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

928
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,008
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

929
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,676
No, I get it!

930
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,012
That's exactly what racing
would do for me!

931
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,513
- Well, guess what?
- What?

932
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,641
News flash! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

933
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,271
What was that?

934
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,498
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

935
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,341
You got to watch out for the splash.

936
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,176
That stuff is broiling hot.

937
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,803
Yeah, I got that. Thank you.

938
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,222
What is this dump?

939
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,017
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

940
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,061
Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

941
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:17,648
I found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

942
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,441
See? Look, look, look.

943
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,444
Welcome to my home!

944
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,030
I sleep in these candy wrappers.

945
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,116
I bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

946
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,619
By yourself?

947
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,580
With all this garbage around you?

948
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,625
Well, yeah.

949
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,877
I mean, everyone here
says I'm just a mistake

950
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,004
and that I wasn't even supposed to exist.

951
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,673
What do you expect?

952
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,217
Listen, kid...

953
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:47,636
I know it's none of my business

954
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,430
but why do you even stick
around this game?

955
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,683
You really don't know anything, do you?

956
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,060
Glitches can't leave their games.

957
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,857
It's one of the joys of being me.

958
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,242
Hey, what are you doing? Come on!

959
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:13,412
I know it's a dump, but it's all I got.

960
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,872
If you're going to be a racer,

961
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,331
you're going to have
to learn how to drive.

962
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,501
And you can't do that without a track.

963
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,800
All right, now.

964
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,552
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

965
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,179
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

966
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:32,598
Wait. Do you know how to drive?

967
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,766
Yeah! I mean, I haven't done it, but...

968
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,476
Look, I flew a spaceship today, okay?

969
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,603
You crashed it.

970
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,314
Just get in. How hard can it be? Okay...

971
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,149
Start it up.

972
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:48,030
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

973
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,948
- Pedals.
- Pedals. Right.

974
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:54,703
Now, that's the go pedal.

975
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,832
That I believe is the stopper.

976
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,835
And this... Wait.

977
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,421
What is this? That doesn't do anything.

978
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,131
What does this joystick do?

979
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,843
Okay, good. Let's try that again.

980
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,208
Now shift it.

981
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,337
That's good. Keep going! Shift it again!

982
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,679
I told you, racing's in my code!

983
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,225
I got that medal in the bag!

984
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,477
Hey, Ralphie, watch this!

985
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:15,993
Look out!

986
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,421
Hot cola!

987
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,927
So how did I do?

988
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,514
Well, you almost blew up
the whole mountain.

989
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,267
Right, right. That's a good note.

990
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,519
You got to get that glitch
under control, kid.

991
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,062
Okay, I will, I will.

992
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,982
And then you think I got a chance?

993
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,861
Tiny.

994
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,696
Yes, I'm going to win!

995
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,740
I'm going to win! I'm going to win!

996
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,700
- Top shelf.
- Top shelf.

997
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,256
Did you find her? Tell me you found her.

998
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,259
You didn't?

999
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,805
Go. Leave me.

1000
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,661
Up, up, down, down...

1001
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,499
Start!

1002
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,506
The code. It's the sweet
lifeblood of the game.

1003
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:03,183
Where are you? Let's see...
Stadium, no. Jumbotron.

1004
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:07,145
There it is. The winner's cup.

1005
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:12,609
One of these things is not
like the others... It's you!

1006
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,529
We're going to give you a nice new home.

1007
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,583
Success!

1008
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,337
Sour Bill, I'm going out.

1009
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,840
You're in charge of the castle
until I get back.

1010
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:47,853
Your face is still red.

1011
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,855
You might want to hit it
again with your hammer.

1012
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,566
That's not blunt force trauma, ma'am.

1013
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,443
That's just the honey glow in my cheeks.

1014
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,279
Okay.

1015
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,699
Ma'am, I just got to tell you...

1016
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:03,410
You are one dynamite gal.

1017
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,457
Wow, you are one dynamite gal.

1018
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,085
One dynamite gal.

1019
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,795
Dynamite gal.

1020
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,297
Dynamite gal.

1021
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,756
Dynamite...

1022
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,513
Get out.

1023
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,473
All I said is you're a dynamite gal.

1024
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,100
I said get out!

1025
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,652
Jiminey jaminey.

1026
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,493
Yes?

1027
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,499
I'm Fix-It Felix Jr., sir,
from the game <i>Fix-It Felix Jr</i>.

1028
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,251
Have you seen my friend Ralph?

1029
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,794
Wreck-It Ralph?

1030
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,588
Yes. Yes, that's him!

1031
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:59,758
We should have locked him up
when we had the chance.

1032
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,092
Locked him up?

1033
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,054
I'm not making the same mistake with you.

1034
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,477
<i>Hurry, hurry! Let's go. Time's a-wastin'.</i>

1035
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:11,686
Come on, Ralph!

1036
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,772
This is it. This is really happening.

1037
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,148
I almost don't believe it.

1038
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,151
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1039
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,403
And now... Now I think I'm
going to puke, actually.

1040
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,863
I mean, I think I might puke.

1041
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,531
- You know, like a "vurp."
- A what?

1042
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,367
Vomit and a burp together,

1043
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,786
and you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1044
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,204
This is so exciting!

1045
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,122
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1046
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,291
Am I ready to be a real racer?

1047
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,502
Ralph, what if the gamers don't like me?

1048
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:39,005
Who doesn't love a brat
with dirty hair? Come on.

1049
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,467
Those people are going to love you.
You know why?

1050
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,220
- Because you're a winner.
- I'm a winner.

1051
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,139
- And you're adorable!
- I'm adorable!

1052
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,849
And everyone loves an adorable winner!

1053
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,393
Yeah!

1054
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,687
Okay, come on. Listen to me.

1055
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,815
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1056
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:01,069
"I must win Ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1057
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,530
- And have fun. Got it?
- Got it.

1058
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,366
Oh, wait!

1059
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,035
Hold on!

1060
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,078
Where are you going?

1061
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,080
I forgot something! I'll be right back!

1062
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,667
Kids.

1063
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,338
Ralph! There you are. Hello!

1064
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,675
- You!
- I come alone, unarmed.

1065
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,219
I've had enough of you, pillow pants!

1066
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,221
Please. Calm down! Please, look. Don't!

1067
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,099
I'm going to beat the filling out of you!

1068
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,227
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

1069
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,731
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1070
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,150
What do you want, Candy?

1071
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,735
Listen, I just want to talk to you.

1072
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,779
I'm not interested in anything
you have to say.

1073
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,867
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1074
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,910
My medal. How did you...

1075
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,748
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1076
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,670
All I ask is that you hear me out.

1077
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,213
About what?

1078
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,258
Ralph, do you know what the hardest part

1079
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,926
about being a king is?

1080
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,721
Doing what's right, no matter what.

1081
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:10,972
Get to the point.

1082
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,266
Point being, I need your help.

1083
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,979
Sad as it is, Vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1084
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,148
Why are you people so against her?

1085
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,443
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1086
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,278
If Vanellope wins that race

1087
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,448
<i>she'll be added to the race roster.</i>

1088
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,993
<i>Then gamers can choose
her as their avatar.</i>

1089
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,913
<i>And when they see her glitching</i>

1090
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,665
<i>and twitching and just being herself,</i>

1091
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,584
<i>they'll think our game is broken.</i>

1092
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:42,796
<i>We'll be put out of order for good.</i>

1093
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,633
<i>All my subjects will be homeless.</i>

1094
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,639
<i>But there's one who cannot
escape because she's a glitch.</i>

1095
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:55,350
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1096
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,936
<i>And when the game's plug is pulled...</i>

1097
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,312
No!

1098
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,732
...she'll die with it.

1099
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,944
You don't know that will happen.

1100
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,237
The gamers could love her.

1101
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:09,447
And if they don't?

1102
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,790
I know it's tough,

1103
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:22,043
but heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1104
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:27,841
She can't race, Ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1105
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:31,344
So can I count on you to talk
a little sense into her?

1106
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,265
Very good.

1107
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,852
I'll give you two some time alone.

1108
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:06,379
I'm back!

1109
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:08,756
Did you miss me?

1110
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,927
Yeah... Can we talk for a second?

1111
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,096
Wait. First, kneel down.

1112
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,515
- What? No, we really...
- Will you just do it?

1113
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,392
Okay.

1114
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,563
- Now, close your eyes.
- Vanellope...

1115
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,981
Shush! Close them!

1116
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,153
Okay. Open them up.

1117
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,950
"To Stinkbrain." Gee, thanks.

1118
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,118
Turn it over.

1119
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:40,997
I made it for you.

1120
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,166
Just in case we don't win.

1121
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,627
Not that I think there's
even a remote chance

1122
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,753
we're not going to win.

1123
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,547
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1124
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:54,552
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1125
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,639
Ralph, come on. Move your molasses.

1126
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,643
- I've been thinking.
- That's dangerous.

1127
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,896
Who cares about this stupid
race anyway? Right?

1128
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,440
That's not very funny, Ralph.

1129
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,609
No, I'm serious, and it was really fun

1130
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,818
to build the car and everything...

1131
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,988
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1132
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,616
Hello? Is Ralph in there?

1133
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,284
I'd like to speak to him, please.

1134
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,286
Look, what I'm saying
is you can't be a racer.

1135
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,621
What?

1136
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,332
Why would you...

1137
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,210
Wait a minute.

1138
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:28,795
No!

1139
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,963
Where did you get this?

1140
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,049
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1141
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,634
I've been talking to King Candy.

1142
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,302
- King Candy?
- Yeah.

1143
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,637
You sold me out?

1144
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,514
No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1145
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,891
No, I understand plenty. Traitor!

1146
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,268
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1147
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:44,686
You're a rat!

1148
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:48,231
And I don't need you, and I
can win the race on my own.

1149
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,066
But I'm trying to save your skin, kid!

1150
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,901
Put me down! Let me go!

1151
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,152
No, you listen to me.

1152
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,237
Do you know what's going to happen

1153
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,321
when the players see you glitching?

1154
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,656
They'll think the game's broken.

1155
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,157
I don't care! You're a liar!

1156
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,743
You better care, because if your
game goes out of order,

1157
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:01,828
you go down with the ship, little sister!

1158
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,996
I'm not listening to you!

1159
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,832
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1160
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,250
No, you're not!

1161
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,879
Take me down from here, Ralph, right now!

1162
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,215
No. I'm doing this for your own good!

1163
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:17,719
Wait, wait, wait.

1164
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,596
No. No.

1165
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:21,598
No, no, no, no, no!

1166
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,849
Please, Ralph!

1167
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:23,933
No!

1168
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,229
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1169
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,831
You really are a bad guy.

1170
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,536
Hello? Anybody home?

1171
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,289
Felix? Mary?

1172
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,250
Well, you actually went and did it.

1173
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,087
Gene. Where is everybody?

1174
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,838
They're gone.

1175
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:39,425
After Felix went to find you
and then didn't come back...

1176
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,844
Everyone panicked and abandoned ship.

1177
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,971
But I'm here now.

1178
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,973
It's too late, Ralph.

1179
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,434
Litwak's pulling our plug in the morning.

1180
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,783
But never let it be said that
I'm not a man of my word.

1181
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,786
The place is yours, Ralph. Enjoy.

1182
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,999
Gene, wait! Wait!

1183
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,878
Listen, this is not what I wanted!

1184
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,005
Well, what did you want, Ralph?

1185
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,466
I don't know. I just...

1186
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,472
I was just tired of living
alone in the garbage.

1187
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:30,476
Well, now you can live
alone in the penthouse.

1188
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:38,878
Hey, cough drop.

1189
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,214
Explain something to me.

1190
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,549
If Vanellope was never meant to exist,

1191
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,427
then why is her picture on the side
of the game console?

1192
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,141
What's going on

1193
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,643
in this candy-coated heart of darkness?

1194
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:54,769
Nothing.

1195
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:55,895
- Talk!
- No.

1196
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,563
- I'll lick you.
- You wouldn't.

1197
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,440
Oh, yeah?

1198
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,025
That's like sandpaper!

1199
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,736
Wonder how many licks it will take

1200
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,154
to get to your center.

1201
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,739
I'll take it to my grave!

1202
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,074
Fair enough.

1203
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,746
They call you Sour Bill for a reason.

1204
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:18,084
- Had enough yet?
- Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1205
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,794
Vanellope was a racer

1206
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:22,338
until King Candy tried to delete her code!

1207
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,507
<i>Tried to delete her code?</i>

1208
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,593
<i>So that's why she's a glitch!
Why is he doing this to her?</i>

1209
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:28,970
I don't know!

1210
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,221
Suit yourself.

1211
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,265
No, no, no! I swear I don't know!

1212
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,142
<i>He literally locked up our memories</i>

1213
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:36,435
<i>and I cannot remember!</i>

1214
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,812
<i>Nobody can!</i>

1215
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,647
But I do know this.

1216
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,607
He'll do anything to keep
her from racing.

1217
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,193
Because if she crosses the finish line,

1218
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,113
the game will reset and she
won't be a glitch anymore!

1219
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,447
Where is she now?

1220
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,866
In the fungeon with Fix-It Felix.

1221
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,117
Felix?

1222
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,994
I'm sorry! That's all I know, I swear!

1223
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,290
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again!

1224
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,793
Stick around.

1225
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:04,005
Yes, okay, I will. I will. Thank you!

1226
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,802
Come on. I know you're out there.

1227
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,639
Saccharine-saturated nightmare!

1228
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:19,020
But... Where?

1229
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:40,291
Doomsday and Armageddon
just had a baby and it is ugly!

1230
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,337
Hello? Hello?

1231
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:48,716
Somebody! Anybody! Please let me out!

1232
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:51,886
What's he say?

1233
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,347
I'm gonna wreck it!

1234
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:01,187
Why do I fix everything I touch?

1235
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,068
- Felix!
- Ralph!

1236
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,362
I'm so glad to see you!

1237
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,074
Wait. No, I'm not. What do you
have to say for yourself!

1238
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,202
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!

1239
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,037
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1240
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,122
But you have to fix this
go-cart for me pronto.

1241
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:23,376
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1242
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,420
I'm just so, so cross with you!

1243
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,714
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1244
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:32,218
I ran higgledy-piggledy all over
creation looking for you.

1245
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,303
I almost drowned in chocolate milk-mix!

1246
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,224
And then... I met the most dynamite gal.

1247
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,978
She gives me the honey
glow something awful.

1248
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,398
But she rebuffed my affections.

1249
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,608
And then I got thrown in jail!

1250
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,235
Felix, pull yourself together.

1251
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:53,114
No! You don't know what
it's like to be rejected

1252
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,907
and treated like a criminal!

1253
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,660
Yes, I do. That's every day of my life.

1254
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,745
It is?

1255
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:03,749
Which is why I ran off and tried
to be a good guy, but I'm not!

1256
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,627
I'm just a bad guy, and I need your help.

1257
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,046
There's a little girl whose
only hope is this cart.

1258
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,132
Please, Felix, fix it.

1259
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:14,719
And I promise I will never
try to be good again.

1260
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,619
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1261
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,248
- And?
- And a real numskull.

1262
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,168
- And?
- A selfish diaper baby.

1263
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,377
And?

1264
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,296
And...

1265
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,506
A stinkbrain?

1266
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,593
The stinkiest brain ever.

1267
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,408
<i>My sweet subjects,</i>

1268
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,329
<i>I can without a pinch
of hesitation assure you</i>

1269
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:26,457
<i>that I have never been
so happy in all my life</i>

1270
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,834
<i>to say the following words,</i>

1271
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,254
<i>let the Random Roster Race commence!</i>

1272
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:52,358
Okay, remember, you don't have to win.

1273
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,027
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1274
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,196
I'm already a real racer.

1275
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,033
And I'm going to win.

1276
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,659
Have some candy.

1277
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,262
Behind you!

1278
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:05,598
In front of you!

1279
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:16,442
- It's The Glitch!
- The Glitch?

1280
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:18,068
Light them up, Candlehead.

1281
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:24,366
<i>What's this? Cherry bombs!</i>

1282
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:34,627
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1283
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:53,646
My candle!

1284
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,358
All right. Gotta keep it under control.

1285
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,984
No more glitching.

1286
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,154
Okay, kid. Let's finish this thing

1287
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:03,656
without any more surprises.

1288
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,992
Hope you're happy, junkpile.

1289
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,120
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1290
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,747
My lady, you came back.

1291
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:13,207
Can it, Fix-It!

1292
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,001
That Cy-Bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1293
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,046
No. It died in the taffy swamp.
Believe me, I...

1294
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:23,676
Bullroar.

1295
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:34,270
Listen up, people.
Head to Game Central Station now!

1296
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,313
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1297
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,148
Go! Go! Go!

1298
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,491
No!

1299
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,743
Get off of my track!

1300
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,077
Hey!

1301
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,579
What, are you crazy!

1302
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:39,460
I forbid you to cross that finish line!

1303
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,296
Knock it off!

1304
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,342
Ralph, look!

1305
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,093
Kid!

1306
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,181
Stop it!

1307
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,267
I'm not letting you undo
all my hard work!

1308
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:58,937
Is that...

1309
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,609
No way!

1310
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,653
What the... Who are you?

1311
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:11,033
I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!

1312
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,786
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1313
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:17,081
and that halitosis-riddled warthog

1314
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,874
take it away from me!

1315
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:21,502
Turbo-tastic.

1316
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,047
End of the line, Glitch!

1317
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,217
Glitch. That's it.

1318
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,177
Come on, Vanellope.

1319
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,970
I know you said you wouldn't do it again

1320
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,139
but you're going to do it one more time.

1321
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,392
Just focus and concentrate

1322
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:39,645
and glitch!

1323
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,819
Sweet mother of monkey milk! I did it!

1324
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:49,905
No!

1325
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:59,415
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!

1326
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,681
No!

1327
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,517
Kid! Are you okay?

1328
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:22,020
I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's finish this race!

1329
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,275
Oh, my land.

1330
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,110
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1331
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,279
But I didn't cross the finish line!

1332
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:32,197
There is no finish line!

1333
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:35,534
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1334
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,371
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1335
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:40,539
We got to try!

1336
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:44,710
Kid!

1337
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,212
Ralph, I told you I can't leave the game.

1338
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,965
- Come on. Get through.
- Ralph! Stop!

1339
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,468
It's got to work!

1340
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,636
Stop, it's no use.

1341
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,271
It's okay, Ralph.

1342
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:07,566
All right, Fix-It.

1343
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:10,402
That's everyone.
Now, we've got to blow up this exit.

1344
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,073
Just go. Go without me.

1345
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,911
- But what about this game?
- Nothing we can do about it.

1346
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:22,498
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1347
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:26,752
Beacon?

1348
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:29,546
Stay with Felix.

1349
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,006
Let me borrow that thing, lady.

1350
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:34,259
- Ralph! Where are you going?
- I got some wrecking to do!

1351
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,220
I'll meet you at the finish line!

1352
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,346
No! Wait!

1353
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,847
Fix-It, get behind me!

1354
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:54,905
Come on!

1355
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,203
One more! One...

1356
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:05,415
Welcome to the boss level!

1357
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:06,750
Turbo.

1358
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:09,795
Because of you, Ralph,

1359
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:14,049
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1360
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,552
I can take over any game I want.

1361
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,428
I should thank you

1362
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,265
but it would be more fun to kill you.

1363
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,310
Get back here, little guy!

1364
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,484
Have some candy!

1365
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,654
Where do you think you're going?

1366
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,453
I'm not through with you yet. Up we go!

1367
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:44,746
No!

1368
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,374
Ralph!

1369
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,504
Fall back.

1370
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:55,507
Kid!

1371
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:02,598
Vanellope!

1372
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:05,475
Look at that. It's your little friend.

1373
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,604
Let's watch her die together, shall we?

1374
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:09,938
No!

1375
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:14,776
It's game over for both of you.

1376
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:18,196
No. Just for me!

1377
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:21,992
- Ralph!
- Vanellope!

1378
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,751
I'm bad, and that's good.

1379
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,046
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

1380
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,967
There's no one I'd rather be...

1381
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:42,471
...than me.

1382
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,583
Kid!

1383
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:14,878
Don't worry. I got it under control.

1384
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:42,906
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh...

1385
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,161
No! No, no, no. Yes...

1386
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:51,123
No! Yes... No!

1387
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:54,543
Go into the light!

1388
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:03,343
Chocolate?

1389
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,055
It's chocolate! I love chocolate!

1390
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,850
Oh, beautiful chocolate!

1391
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:10,976
Yeah!

1392
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,480
You did it, Ralph! Way to go, brother!

1393
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,321
I... Excuse...

1394
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,788
All fixed.

1395
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:35,041
- You ready for this?
- As ready as I'll ever be.

1396
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,553
What's with all the magic sparkles?

1397
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,042
Princess Vanellope?

1398
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,169
Now I remember.

1399
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:24,591
All hail the rightful ruler of <i>Sugar Rush</i>...

1400
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,384
Princess Vanellope.

1401
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,387
I remember. She's our princess!

1402
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:30,722
Oh, that's right!

1403
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,641
We are so sorry about
the way we treated you.

1404
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,226
Yeah, those were jokes!

1405
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:37,145
I was just doing what
Taffyta told me to do!

1406
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,064
Tut-tut.

1407
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:42,734
As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree

1408
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:47,322
that everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1409
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:48,782
executed.

1410
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,326
What? No, please!

1411
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,744
Oh, my land.

1412
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,080
This place just got interesting.

1413
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,415
I don't want to die!

1414
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:01,086
I'm just kidding. Stop crying, Taffyta.

1415
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:03,088
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1416
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,757
Wow.

1417
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:09,010
So this is the real you. Princess.

1418
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:13,098
Aw, Ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1419
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,685
This is me.

1420
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,938
Look, the code may say I'm a princess

1421
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,648
but I know who I really am, Ralph,

1422
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,860
I'm a racer with the greatest
superpower ever.

1423
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,444
I was here, I was there.

1424
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,446
I was glitching through the walls.

1425
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,614
I'm not giving that up.

1426
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:31,783
Pardon me for asking,

1427
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,078
but without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1428
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,162
Yeah. Who?

1429
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:40,083
Me. I'm thinking more along the lines of

1430
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:42,294
a constitutional democracy.

1431
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,839
President Vanellope von Schweetz.

1432
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,632
Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

1433
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:51,553
Fix-It, Wreck-It,
the arcade's about to open.

1434
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,555
Let's move 'em out.

1435
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:03,815
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1436
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,191
You'd have your own wing

1437
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,027
where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1438
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:09,154
or treat you bad ever again.

1439
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:11,197
You could be happy.

1440
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:14,367
I'm already happy.

1441
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:16,369
I've got the coolest friend in the world.

1442
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:19,497
And besides, I've got a job to do, too.

1443
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:23,335
It may not be as fancy as being president

1444
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:24,711
but it's my duty.

1445
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:26,421
And it's a big duty!

1446
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:29,633
Ralph, are you coming, brother?

1447
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:33,845
See you later, President Fart Feathers.

1448
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:36,973
<i>Au revoir,</i> Admiral Underpants.

1449
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:40,352
And farewell, Baroness Boogerface.

1450
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,771
Goodbye, Major Body Odor!

1451
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:45,231
- <i>Hasta la vista,</i> you...
- Ralph!

1452
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,817
- All right. To be continued.
- Yeah!

1453
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:49,569
Hooray!

1454
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,124
<i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i>

1455
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:08,213
Hey! Ralph's back! Isn't that great!

1456
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:10,924
The gang's all here!

1457
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:15,261
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1458
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:17,013
I'm taking life one game at a time.

1459
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:19,391
All right! Yeah, Ralph!

1460
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:21,017
<i>Of course, the job hasn't changed.</i>

1461
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,772
<i>But, news flash, the Nicelanders
are being nice to me!</i>

1462
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,193
<i>And that got me thinking about those
poor guys left without a game.</i>

1463
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,779
<i>- So here's what we did.
- We're gonna wreck it!</i>

1464
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,156
<i>We asked them to help us out
on the bonus levels.</i>

1465
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:37,283
<i>We can fix it!</i>

1466
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:39,035
<i>I'm telling you, guys,</i>

1467
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:40,912
<i>we haven't been this popular in years.</i>

1468
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,288
- <i>It's crazy.</i>
- Wow!

1469
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:44,916
<i>The gamers say we're "retro,"</i>

1470
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,836
<i>which I think means "old but cool."</i>

1471
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:49,421
How come we never noticed this game?

1472
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,423
<i>And I decided that living in the dump</i>

1473
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,091
<i>wasn't making me feel very good,</i>

1474
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:55,760
<i>so I cleaned it up,
built myself a little shack</i>

1475
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,512
<i>and a couple for the new guys, too.</i>

1476
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,933
<i>Well, with a little help from Felix.</i>

1477
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:04,394
<i>And guess who was the best man
at his and Calhoun's wedding.</i>

1478
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:07,689
<i>That's right, my friends,
old Ham Hands himself.</i>

1479
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,358
<i>Very elegant affair.
You should've seen it.</i>

1480
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:11,943
<i>Lot of grandeur.</i>

1481
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,445
<i>And not a single bug.</i>

1482
01:32:17,323 --> 01:32:20,869
<i>Let's just say, some tears were shed.</i>

1483
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:26,124
<i>But I got to say, the best part of my day</i>

1484
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:28,043
<i>is when I get thrown off the roof.</i>

1485
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,671
<i>Because when the Nicelanders lift me up,</i>

1486
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,216
<i>I get a perfect view of</i> Sugar Rush.

1487
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,302
<i>And I can see Vanellope racing.</i>

1488
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:41,139
<i>Yes!</i>

1489
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:43,516
<i>The kid's a natural.</i>

1490
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,644
<i>And the players love her, glitch and all.</i>

1491
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:48,813
<i>Just like I knew they would.</i>

1492
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,526
<i>Turns out I don't need a medal
to tell me I'm a good guy.</i>

1493
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,322
<i>'Cause if that little kid likes me...</i>

1494
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,410
<i>How bad can I be?</i>
