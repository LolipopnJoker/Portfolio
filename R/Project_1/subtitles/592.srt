1
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,882
There's a reporter in
London named Simon Ross.

2
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,721
We caught some phone chatter we
didn't like and his name came up.

3
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,390
They put a team out there
to take a better look.

4
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,643
They've been sitting on
him pretty tight all day.

5
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,357
I just got a call about an hour ago.
We got a real problem here.

6
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:30,733
What kind of problem?

7
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,027
This guy's a writer
for The Guardian.

8
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:38,533
He's preparing an exposé on Jason
Bourne, Treadstone and Blackbriar.

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,909
Sourced how?

10
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:40,993
Unknown.

11
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,038
From Bourne? Is it possible?

12
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,122
Possible?

13
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,251
We had Bourne six
weeks ago in Moscow.

14
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,713
He was on foot, wounded, with a
full Cossack posse up his ass.

15
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,924
Somehow, he walked out of there.

16
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,927
I've kind of lost my perspective
on what's possible.

17
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,263
You sound tired, Ezra.

18
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,349
I would make more of an
effort if I were you.

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,102
You're the director of the
Central Intelligence Agency

20
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,605
of the United States of America,
for God's sake. Act like it.

21
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,608
If I go down for this, Mark,
if this goes any more wrong..

22
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,693
Ezra,

23
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,739
you were given a Ferrari and your
people treated it like a lawn mower.

24
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,784
You break it, you bought it.
It was ever thus.

25
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,956
Well, maybe I should be
speaking directly to Ric Byer.

26
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,375
No, no, no. You're in
enough trouble already.

27
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,419
I'll let him know.

28
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,688
Julie, is that the last of them?
Terrific, thank you.

29
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,399
So, the last audit
on Treadstone?

30
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,067
Third page.

31
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,902
Seven weeks ago.

32
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,823
This is from the CIA,
or this is ours?

33
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,366
Oh, no. It's theirs.

34
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,076
This whole pile is theirs.

35
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,577
Is anybody reading
these ground cables?

36
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,079
Look, how wide are we digging?

37
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,248
What do you mean, "how wide?"
Just get me everything.

38
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,168
Treadstone, Blackbriar, Outcome, LARX.
All the beta programs.

39
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,004
And that means take it all the
way back to Emerald Lake.

40
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,215
I want all points of convergence,
I want all research personnel,

41
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,300
I want to know about
anybody who talked

42
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,594
to anybody about
anything at any time.

43
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,764
Seriously, has anybody looked
at this stuff on Bourne?

44
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,225
The field reports.
It's incredible.

45
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,771
Three years off-program, non-med,
first-gen, still rolling.

46
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,274
If there's any way we can
score some data off of this..

47
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,401
If they caught him alive..

48
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,279
I mean, even as a base line.

49
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,573
Even forensically.

50
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,616
Maybe you're in the
wrong meeting.

51
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,245
Because the meeting that we're
having is about an infection.

52
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,206
We're here talking about
a serious infection

53
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,209
and all we're trying to do is
determine how far it's spread

54
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,628
so that we know how much we have
to cut to save the patient.

55
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,631
You have never heard
of Treadstone.

56
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,052
And Bourne.. I don't care if they bag
him and drop the body on the sidewalk.

57
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,470
We're not going to touch it.

58
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,388
You're going to turn off
that side of your head now

59
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,890
and get with the
rest of us here.

60
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,392
And you're going to start to consider
the magnitude of what we're facing

61
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,436
if this moves sideways on us.

62
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,688
Because if we get into
this, we dig around,

63
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,066
and we find out these CIA clowns

64
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,320
have let this Treadstone mess metastasize
into the rest of these programs?

65
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,948
Just pray that that
doesn't happen.

66
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,254
We're just getting reports coming
in now from Waterloo Station

67
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,964
that there has been a shooting.

68
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,800
Let's take you live down there
and speak to Jeremy Thompson.

69
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,051
Jeremy?

70
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,221
There's still an awful lot of
confusion here at Waterloo Station.

71
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,640
As you can see, ambulances
have been called up.

72
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,476
The victim, Simon Ross,
was a veteran reporter

73
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,436
with The Guardian
newspaper in London.

74
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,063
He was pronounced
dead at the scene.

75
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,815
Police are now telling us
there was at least one,

76
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,817
and possibly as many
as three, shots fired.

77
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,736
Simon Ross, a reporter with
The Guardian newspaper..

78
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,903
Hey, James. Hey.

79
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,364
Oh, shit, sorry. I didn't
know I was coming back.

80
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,782
It's all right.

81
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,456
Can you tell
Dr. Hillcott I'm here?

82
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,624
You got it.

83
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,970
See you tomorrow.

84
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,736
I had no idea he was coming in.

85
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,488
It's Number Six. Number Six?

86
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,490
We haven't seen him since July.

87
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,908
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

88
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,912
"Need new base panels, choline
profile, nerve conduction."

89
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,623
I want a full
engraftment workup.

90
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,751
I'm gonna call NRAG and see if we
can't get approval to put him under.

91
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,920
I want a marrow and a full
spinal while we have him.

92
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,255
Okay.

93
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,517
How is he?

94
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,102
He's prepped.

95
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,231
He drank a half-liter of
water while he was waiting.

96
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,983
He had some renal
issues last year.

97
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,860
Or maybe he was thirsty.

98
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,197
I have a pending task request.

99
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,615
I know, I read it.

100
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,535
I'm trying to complete
my cortex study.

101
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,664
He'll get a more sustained
contrast off an IV.

102
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,082
I'm approved?

103
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,417
Mmm-hmm.

104
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,378
Yes! Thank you!

105
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,881
Sorry to keep you waiting.

106
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,888
We haven't seen you in a while

107
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,641
so we're going to be doing
a full spec workup.

108
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,476
I just had a full spec
three months ago.

109
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,396
Yeah, well, we had to change
the boundary schedules

110
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,565
and you're a week
over the new line.

111
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,567
Let me get this straight,
if I had come in

112
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,402
10 days ago, I would
have been in the clear?

113
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
It never gets any
longer, does it?

114
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,034
You're gonna have
to take that off.

115
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,046
Today, I have the honor
of introducing the man

116
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,090
who is going to introduce
our guest of honor.

117
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,926
Bert? Doctor Albert Hirsch.

118
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,892
I first met Dan Hillcott in 1987

119
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,687
at what must have
been the most boring

120
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,732
neuropsych conference ever held.

121
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,070
We managed to escape
that dreary ballroom

122
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,324
and find a dark corner
and a cold beverage.

123
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,662
And we've been finding
dark corners ever since.

124
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,840
My God.

125
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,599
Where did you find this?

126
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,768
YouTube.

127
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,312
I thought we had
everything firewalled.

128
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Yeah, so did I.

129
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,357
But then again, I thought the
CIA would handle Treadstone,

130
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,942
so maybe I'm just
behind the curve.

131
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,361
Hmm.

132
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,863
Well, is that it?
Is that all of it?

133
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,324
No, no. They apparently
thought it was okay

134
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,410
to attend about a half a dozen
of these things together.

135
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,454
Proving what?

136
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,248
We're looking at the medical
directors of Treadstone and Outcome

137
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,042
publicly celebrating their
top secret man-crush.

138
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:18,839
If this Bourne mess exposes Treadstone,
they will turn Hirsch inside out.

139
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,258
They'll be talking to Hillcott
before we even know what happened.

140
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,177
What's the damage?

141
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,265
Outcome. We'd lose Outcome.

142
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,933
Uh, meaning what?

143
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,228
Meaning we will burn the
program to the ground.

144
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,063
And I mean from top to bottom.

145
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,526
Because of this?

146
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,403
Because they're friends?

147
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,572
These two guys built
our platform!

148
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,324
You want to wake up
and see this on CNN?

149
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,826
Jesus, Ric. Just like that?

150
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,077
Hirsch and Hillcott?

151
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,746
How many people even
understand this work,

152
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,414
let alone have the
will to pursue it?

153
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,999
Nothing has even happened yet!

154
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,417
And we have to get ready.

155
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:04,927
Ready for what?

156
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,556
We don't lose it all, we've got the science.
We'll keep the data.

157
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,352
All of our JSOK liaisons
seem to be safe.

158
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,729
We've got the beta
programs tucked away.

159
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,357
We'll take a pause,
and we'll rebuild it.

160
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,776
I wish there was a better
alternative, but..

161
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,447
God.

162
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,529
Are you going to pretend
you don't know I'm here?

163
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,491
I was just trying to be polite.

164
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,877
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

165
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,964
What did you do? Did you
come over the mountain?

166
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,675
Don't they forward my position?

167
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,469
You beat the record by two days.

168
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,680
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

169
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,101
You didn't know
there was a record?

170
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,021
No. It never came up.

171
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,651
It wasn't your record, was it?

172
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,654
No one comes over the mountain.

173
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,698
Yeah, well, I did.

174
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,366
I'm Aaron, by the way.

175
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,201
Why did you do that?

176
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,287
If you weren't on the
clock, why take the risk?

177
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,205
Why take the mountain?

178
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,085
I lost my chems.

179
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,381
I dropped my program
kit, that's why.

180
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,872
All right.

181
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,583
Protocol is for me to
call in your arrival.

182
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,086
They're going to want a sample pick-up.
You got blood work, right?

183
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,254
I owe today.

184
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,173
All right, pull it now.

185
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,717
The drone takes about three
hours to get up here

186
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:54,930
so I'll get some food started.
You can dry your shit.

187
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,645
So, look..

188
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,439
I got a real problem, here.

189
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,694
I came over that mountain
because I lost my chems.

190
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,946
What are you taking?

191
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,533
My daily? Phys meds, 250 green.

192
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,160
Cognitive programs, 400 blue.

193
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,912
Define "lost."

194
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,207
Lost. Fell into the rocks
off a 20-meter cliff.

195
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,291
Lost.

196
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,293
How is that possible?

197
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,379
Look, I've had a pack of wolves

198
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,172
on my ass since I
left the drop, okay?

199
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,925
I thought I lost them, but
they came at me at the river,

200
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,553
so I took the ledge up to the ravine
to try to rally out the night.

201
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,679
I chose wrong.

202
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,472
I got caught out in the
open, I couldn't climb.

203
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,433
I couldn't make a fire,
my hands got stiff.

204
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:41,893
I dropped them.

205
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,188
You're going to have
to write that up.

206
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,611
So, is that yours?

207
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,405
Hmm?

208
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,783
The blood work?

209
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,243
That's yours, isn't it?

210
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,122
You're not a contact, are you?

211
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,963
Look, I'm sorry to call
you out like that.

212
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,840
It's just that..

213
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,801
I have never met anybody
in the program before.

214
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,680
Never, nobody. You're the..

215
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,146
I know you have some
extra chems here.

216
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,524
I'm not supposed to ration you
out until you leave tomorrow.

217
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,694
Yeah.

218
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,781
Did you chem today?

219
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,408
Green only.

220
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,036
I haven't had a
blue in 32 hours.

221
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,364
People, listen up.

222
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,074
We have an imminent threat.

223
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,287
This is a national security
emergency, priority level five.

224
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,668
It's Wills.

225
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,841
Ric Byer.

226
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,677
Hey. Uh, he's here.

227
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,304
Bourne is here, in New York.

228
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,389
What?

229
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,099
Jason Bourne is in Manhattan.

230
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,308
Confirmed.

231
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,895
He's alive and mobile. That's all I have.
I gotta go.

232
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,418
Your friends are here.

233
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,587
I know.

234
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,133
Don't you think that's strange?

235
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,844
The wolves? They don't do that.

236
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,096
They don't track people.

237
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,806
Yeah.

238
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,100
Maybe they don't
think you're human.

239
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,023
So, how many of us are there?

240
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,319
You ask too many questions.

241
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,739
Maybe you don't know, either.

242
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,161
So, what are you doing
up here anyway?

243
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,002
How do you know that I'm
not evaluating you?

244
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,713
I don't know. Are you?

245
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,799
Maybe I don't care.

246
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,304
Do you ever not care?

247
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,351
Maybe you're evaluating me.

248
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,232
I went off the grid for four
days, that's why I'm here.

249
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,150
I skipped my check-in.

250
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
Now I'm on this bullshit
scavenger hunt.

251
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,822
They have their reasons.

252
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,949
Yeah, well..

253
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,911
I thought I was having my wrist
slapped, but now I'm not so sure.

254
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,623
I'm still trying to
figure out if you're

255
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,917
supposed to kill me or
give me a pep talk.

256
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,379
Seriously, man, you
think too much.

257
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,550
Aren't we wired to stick
our nose in, you and I?

258
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,927
There's not another
person for 300 miles.

259
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,722
I know nobody's listening. Come on,
you've got to give me something.

260
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,099
Talk to me, come on!

261
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,811
Why did they pull you off the
field and put you up here?

262
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,400
It's not physical, with the way you've
been moving, so what did you do?

263
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,486
Turn down an assignment?
Start thinking for yourself?

264
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,905
Fall in love?

265
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,827
You fell in love.

266
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,096
It's better for wolves.

267
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,433
There's an ammo box by the door,
you take as much as you need.

268
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,976
We're done talking.

269
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,480
You ate, you're pulling out early.
You should hit it.

270
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,523
Okay.

271
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,279
Some other time, then. Yeah.

272
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,326
Thanks. Good luck.

273
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,901
What's this?

274
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,613
I think that we need to
clarify something here, Don.

275
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,115
Clarify what?

276
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,659
You keep using the
word "unacceptable"

277
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,163
and I want to know exactly what
you think you mean by that.

278
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,248
"Unacceptable" means
exactly that.

279
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,791
I don't like what
you're telling me,

280
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,084
I don't like how
you're telling me.

281
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,504
We're in a critical phase
on four missions, Ric.

282
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:10,300
The intelligence loss, if we stop
now, it couldn't be quantified.

283
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,510
Yes, actually, it could.

284
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,638
You'd be right back to where you were
before we delivered the program.

285
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,307
Don't tell me there's a
problem with Outcome

286
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,850
because I'd be hearing about it.

287
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,187
I didn't say there was. You're
not saying much of anything.

288
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,565
One pill, once a week.

289
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,525
Every eight days.

290
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,944
So, no more blues and greens.

291
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,780
We're transitioning
everyone in the program.

292
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,992
Do you remember how to
keep an accurate diet log?

293
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,578
Yes.

294
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,164
Do you understand
their full utility?

295
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,041
We just set Iran's
missile program back

296
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,543
36 months with one
deep-cover agent.

297
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,837
The best action recon
out of North Korea

298
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,173
in the last two years
came from Outcome.

299
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,300
I'm fully aware of this. Do you
know how long we've waited

300
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,721
to get a real, long-term
operative inside Pakistani ISI?

301
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,058
You're asking me to
wipe the most valuable

302
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,310
intel-gathering assets we've
ever put in the field.

303
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,312
We're shutting things
down immediately

304
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,941
and this contingency was
covered loud and clear.

305
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,591
Tell me this isn't why we're
having this conversation.

306
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,260
Jason Bourne got
away, didn't he?

307
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,763
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?

308
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:43,351
I have visibility on every action
program in the system except yours.

309
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,145
I'm sick of hearing the reason I
can't do something or see something

310
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,274
is because it hasn't cleared the
National Research Assay Group.

311
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,567
Where do you pull
this kind of weight?

312
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,945
Don, I'm a patriot,
the same as you are.

313
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,489
I bleed over this the
same way you do.

314
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,283
But you and I have our jobs

315
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,285
because we've got the strength
to do what's necessary

316
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,454
and I'm sorry, but
right now, this is it.

317
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,352
It's really coming down out there.
It's getting ugly.

318
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,853
Oh, yeah?

319
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,357
Well, maybe I should try
to get ahead of it, huh?

320
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,860
No, it's too late for that.
Just stick around.

321
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,155
I need some help squaring
the place away, anyway.

322
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,157
Yeah, I don't know.

323
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,078
I already have to do that
medication write-up.

324
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,537
I don't know if I want
to have to explain

325
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,164
my itinerary as well,
you know what I mean?

326
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,583
Don't worry about the
chems, I got that covered.

327
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,507
I'm gonna have a look.

328
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,734
Are you hearing that?

329
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,702
Are you expecting anything?

330
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,163
In this weather,
without a heads-up?

331
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,166
Well, it's definitely
getting closer.

332
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,877
What do you got?

333
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,921
Nothing, man, I got nothing.

334
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,506
Is it working? Yeah,
it's working.

335
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,174
The gear is fine.
It's not the gear.

336
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,719
Well, maybe it's a resupply.

337
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,097
They were here yesterday, and
they can't land in this, anyway.

338
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,356
Who the hell is it?

339
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,567
I don't know.

340
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,281
I don't know. We should spread.

341
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,867
Yeah. Look, I'll take the nest.

342
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,536
Let me know when you get
eyes on it, okay? Yeah.

343
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,182
Is she gonna clear us here?

344
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,725
I'd like to get above this
before it gets any sloppier.

345
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,852
Now, hold on. Just, there's a..

346
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,230
Copy, Solo, I saw it, too.
Give us a minute.

347
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,314
Wilco.

348
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,150
What's the issue?
Hang on, hang on.

349
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,615
Roger, Solo. Sourcing now.

350
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,494
It looks like there's still
an active signal back there.

351
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,995
Excuse me?

352
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,539
Is that on your end or is that..
My end.

353
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,499
We're having a hard time
getting a handshake.

354
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,543
Roger, Solo. Holding on relay.

355
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,794
I thought you had them linked.

356
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,045
We did.

357
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,089
They were lined up, all
the way to the structure.

358
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,924
Both targets were
green, all the way in.

359
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,096
Is there a PID? Unknown.

360
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,556
Hostile? Unknown.

361
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,890
It's not a satellite
echo, is it?

362
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,141
No, sir.

363
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,268
What's she doing?

364
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,352
She's playing it back.

365
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,858
I don't want to wait on her. We're
going to have to come around.

366
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,111
How far are you from bingo fuel?

367
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,904
Twenty minutes on station.

368
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,531
Better get on it.

369
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,172
Affirmative, Solo, but we're
gonna need another pass here.

370
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,216
She knows we can't see shit, right?
Check it.

371
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:09,218
Roger that. New profile engaged.

372
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,428
We're coming around now.

373
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,972
Roger that, Solo.
East-southeast.

374
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,308
Coming right back up the valley.

375
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,351
Requesting fuel graph,
say your state.

376
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,937
State two-plus-30 to splash.

377
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,898
Copy, Solo. Fuel
to bingo is green.

378
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,442
Sourcing target beacon now.

379
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,083
What just happened?

380
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,757
It's gone. Where the
hell did it go?

381
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,966
What do you mean,
"Where did it go?"

382
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,260
Solo, we are negative
on that signal here.

383
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,012
We just lost that second beacon.

384
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,113
Negative, negative, Solo. All
sensors and systems are green.

385
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,449
Diagnostics are green,
aircraft is green.

386
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,867
I got everything
but a target here.

387
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,418
It is not a system issue.
Sensors are good.

388
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,337
All right, we're going to
switch to IR and take a look.

389
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,713
Roger. Switching to thermal.

390
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,815
Solo, can I get your
last confirmed..

391
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,275
What the hell was that?

392
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,819
Red Crown, we're
getting some music.

393
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,487
You hit something.

394
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,614
I don't think so. Red
Crown, you getting this?

395
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,783
There is nothing there.
There is nothing.

396
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,660
What the hell is going on, here?

397
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,882
It didn't just go down, it was shot down?
They're sure about that?

398
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,134
That's what I was told.

399
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,301
By who? With what?

400
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,386
They don't know.

401
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,180
They were sourcing a second
signal when it happened.

402
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,768
No, no, no, we didn't have time.
I'm calling for clearance now.

403
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,728
There's got to be someone
meeting us at the gate.

404
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,896
They have a drone ready?

405
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,147
They're fueling one now.

406
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,873
They parsed the signal.

407
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:27,917
It's Aaron Cross.

408
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:30,711
Shit.

409
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,850
You're all set, sir.

410
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,240
Let's approach off azimuth,
30 degrees off our last pass.

411
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,908
Good for me.

412
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,079
Red Crown to contact.
Three-zero-zero for 30.

413
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,914
There you are.
There's my signal.

414
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,707
Signal is hot, Solo.

415
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,627
Signal is up and live.
And here we go.

416
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,254
Where's that been?

417
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,672
Doesn't matter now. It's mine.

418
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,243
Copy, Solo. Strong signal.

419
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,121
What kind of weapon system
is this guy operating?

420
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,707
He's probably got a rifle.

421
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,627
It's a high-powered rifle.

422
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,713
What's our time frame, here?

423
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,214
Fifteen minutes, plus or minus.

424
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,716
Just trying to factor the storm.

425
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,902
Roger, Solo. Target is static.
Engaging laser now.

426
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,457
Hey!

427
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,088
Get out of here!

428
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:20,506
Go on, get out of here!

429
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,386
Get out!

430
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,551
Laser armed.

431
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,387
Sensor and thermal confirmed.

432
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,787
- Where are we?
- Thirty seconds.

433
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,082
You should have left me alone.

434
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,505
Arming missile.

435
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,137
Missile away.

436
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:52,890
There he goes, he's moving now.

437
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,183
Not for long.

438
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,774
Target destroyed.

439
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,941
Red Crown, splash one.

440
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,029
Copy, Solo. Kill confirmed,
target destroyed.

441
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,239
Looking good?

442
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:15,037
Looks good. Looks
cold and clear.

443
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,333
With all due respect, sir,
now is not the best time.

444
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,335
In 20 minutes, this place
is going to fall apart.

445
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,713
I'm aware of that, I'll take the chance.
We need to talk.

446
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,467
I need you to stop what
you're doing and turn around.

447
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,802
That's an order.

448
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,513
We got screwed on
the intel, okay?

449
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,640
Nobody knew those
people were in there.

450
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,768
It would be perfectly normal
for a person to have doubts

451
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,812
about the morality of what
we just asked you to do.

452
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,979
Is that a question, sir?

453
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,316
No, it's not. Tune in to what
I'm trying to say to you.

454
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,735
Do you know what a sin-eater is?

455
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,947
That's what we are. We
are the sin-eaters.

456
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,534
It means that we take the moral
excrement that we find in this equation

457
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,494
and we bury it down
deep inside of us

458
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,621
so that the rest of our
cause can stay pure.

459
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,123
That is the job.

460
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,001
We are morally indefensible
and absolutely necessary.

461
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,879
Do you understand?

462
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,468
Will that be all?

463
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:15,681
Stitch that up.

464
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,225
I'm gonna put you on a plane
to Yemen in six hours.

465
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,977
I'll be ready.

466
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,574
I told you she'd
be coming at us.

467
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,911
Yeah, I need you to
stay calm, Terry, okay?

468
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,163
They're giving her
a Senate hearing.

469
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,622
How can you not see
that as a problem?

470
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,293
She knows Bourne, she knows
Blackbriar, she knows Hirsch.

471
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,420
She's got a handle on the
whole goddamn operation.

472
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,422
I don't see how the hell you
could be so calm about this!

473
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,007
Well, what can she say?

474
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,467
What can she say?

475
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,844
What if she gets up
there and she says,

476
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,888
"Treadstone, Blackbriar,
you think that was it?"

477
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,598
"You think that Jason Bourne
was the whole story?"

478
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,308
"Sorry, there's a lot
more going on here."

479
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,477
What if she tells them that Treadstone
was just the tip of the iceberg?

480
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,645
Look, you want to
sweat something?

481
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,731
Worry about Outcome, because we're
still not out of the woods.

482
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,942
But as far as our other programs,
she doesn't know that much.

483
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,360
How do you know that?

484
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,907
Because we're tapped into
everything she says and does.

485
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,241
What?

486
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,371
Phones, email, cars,
house, lawyer.

487
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,251
She was cooked the minute she
hitched her wagon to Jason Bourne.

488
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,129
She aided and abetted an
international fugitive.

489
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,716
She prevented the agency from
shutting down a rogue operation.

490
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,553
She violated every oath and
code of conduct that matters.

491
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,932
For Christ's sake, she brought the
son of a bitch back to America.

492
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,684
Now, God knows what
her motives are,

493
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,939
but it's clear that protecting
this country is not one of them.

494
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,400
That used to be called treason.

495
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,356
Even the solution here. Now, that
should be coming up as a constant.

496
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,928
There you are. I don't
understand these values..

497
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,600
My God, no!

498
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,438
Did you hear that? Yeah.

499
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,939
What is that?

500
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,232
It's a gun.

501
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,152
No. I.. No. Yeah.
No, it was gunfire.

502
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,199
No, please. No, no, no!

503
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,579
Help!

504
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:13,043
Open the door! He's shooting us!
Open the door!

505
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,715
Open the door! He's got a gun!

506
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,425
Open the door!

507
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,471
Help!

508
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:27,974
Oh, my God.

509
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:29,601
We got to be able to get a card!

510
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,228
We have to be able
to get in there!

511
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,941
What's happening? We gotta
go for the back door.

512
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,401
It's locked. He
locked the back door.

513
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,822
No, please.

514
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,240
He's gonna kill us all.

515
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,993
Don't do this. Oh, my God.

516
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,581
Move!

517
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,041
He's shooting everyone in there!

518
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,335
I need a red lab access card!
Who's got a red lab access card?

519
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,461
They're bringing one
down from upstairs.

520
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,046
They're all in there. Everyone
who has one is in there.

521
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,528
Billy, where are you, man?
I need a red card now!

522
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,703
Don.. What are you doing?

523
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,097
Shit, the handle's off.

524
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,690
The handle's off!

525
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,309
Drop it! Stop! Drop the weapon!

526
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,566
Drop it! Drop the weapon!

527
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,615
Investigators are still
searching for some explanation

528
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,826
behind the workplace
murder-suicide

529
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,912
that left another American
community grieving and shocked.

530
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,747
Police and federal authorities

531
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,876
The boys need to see
you right away.

532
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,047
Let's get that Foite story
out there right away.

533
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,424
I'll take care of it.

534
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,512
And this area, back here?

535
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:54,598
That's all been
converted to storage.

536
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,434
Because it says on the blueprint,
and even on the board, there,

537
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:01,771
that it's a medical
examination suite.

538
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,108
I mean, what kind of examinations
are we talking about?

539
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,445
There we go. May I see
the hand, please?

540
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,491
Oh, that has healed well.

541
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,577
Any diminished sensation?

542
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,954
Nope.

543
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,047
Are you trying to
put me down, doc?

544
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,965
I'm afraid there's
been a few gaps

545
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,675
in your sample deliveries, so..

546
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,760
Uh-oh.

547
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,429
We need a full
work-up this visit.

548
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,973
Another one?

549
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,143
Why? Is it 'cause I
missed a blood drop?

550
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,315
So, how do you think
it works, doc?

551
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,526
That we can just call a timeout?

552
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,863
Everything stops while
you pull your samples?

553
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,115
Why don't you lie
down and relax?

554
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,283
Yeah.

555
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,579
What do you think
that we do out there?

556
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,997
Okay, that's enough information.

557
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,749
No, I..

558
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,377
Well, you're just a doctor.

559
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,754
You know we're on camera.

560
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,924
Really?

561
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,636
Is that why you make such
an attractive appearance?

562
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:18,014
Okay, why don't you count
backward from 100, please?

563
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,789
Hello?

564
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,167
Yeah, the gate should be open.

565
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,380
Bear to the left. It's
about half-a-mile up.

566
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,112
Thanks.

567
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,907
Dr. Shearing? Uh-huh.

568
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,075
Hi, I'm Dr. Connie Dowd.

569
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,869
Hi, how are you? Well, thanks.

570
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,746
This is Special
Agent Larry Hooper.

571
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:10,914
Hello. Hello.

572
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,291
Please. Come in.

573
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,335
Thanks for letting us come out.

574
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,504
It's a remarkable property.
What a project.

575
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,841
Yeah, I really don't want
to talk about the house.

576
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,093
Not unless you want to buy it.

577
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,308
Sit, I guess. Please.

578
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,895
Just so you know, okay,

579
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,565
I didn't know anything about
this meeting until an hour ago.

580
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,109
And nobody last night
said to make time

581
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,945
or pick a time, or
anything like that.

582
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,822
And then, this morning, I buy a
plane ticket to see my sister

583
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,700
and suddenly it's like
DEFCON 4 around here.

584
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,494
And that is not paranoia, okay?

585
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,287
That is pretty much
directly in my face!

586
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,372
Understood.

587
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,123
Should we not be
paying attention?

588
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,792
Can you leave us alone, Larry?

589
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,548
Look.

590
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,426
You've just been through an
extremely traumatic experience.

591
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:08,471
Yeah. Doctor of what?

592
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,139
What are you?

593
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,683
Clinical psychology.

594
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,268
Oh. So, what do you do?

595
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:17,480
You give grief
counseling to spies?

596
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,983
You have a very unusual
security clearance, Marta.

597
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,484
You should expect
that buying a ticket

598
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,070
to Montreal without telling
anyone would set off some bells.

599
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:28,116
Yeah, I've got some bells
of my own going off, okay?

600
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,701
I mean, are you going to
be the person who tells me

601
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,494
what the hell is going on here,

602
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,538
or are you just the next
mystery babysitter?

603
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:35,665
What do you think is going on?

604
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,418
What I'm trying to
do is not think.

605
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,253
I just.. I want
to stop thinking.

606
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,422
Have you discussed those
feelings with anyone else?

607
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,881
Your sister? Friends?

608
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,091
Are you for real?

609
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,634
What about Peter Boyd?

610
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:49,971
Wow.

611
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,639
Okay.

612
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:55,059
So, we're into everything, is that it?
Is anything off-limits here?

613
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,479
Have you ever read your
employment security contract?

614
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,314
Have I read my..

615
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,652
If you're asking me whether I
understand my disclosure restrictions,

616
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,571
yes, I have a PhD
in biochemistry

617
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,407
with postdoctoral fellowships
in virology and genetics.

618
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:10,825
I know how to read!

619
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,328
What I don't understand
is why my colleague

620
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:18,541
has a psychotic episode and
shot everyone in the lab.

621
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:23,171
Are you aware of
what we do in there?

622
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,506
Are you?

623
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,676
I mean, how do I know that you're
even cleared for this conversation?

624
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,887
Have you discussed anything
to do with the incident

625
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,139
with anyone other than
the investigators?

626
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,516
Peter Boyd moved out
eight months ago.

627
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,268
But I guess you
already know that.

628
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,104
And, no, I haven't
spoken to him.

629
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:44,692
You stated that you and Dr. Foite had
no relationship outside of work.

630
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,445
None.

631
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:51,157
There was material in his
apartment that indicates he had

632
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,076
an unusual fixation with you.

633
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:58,498
Photographs, journal entries. They
found several articles of clothing.

634
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,832
What?

635
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,752
Did you ever rebuff
him in any way?

636
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,836
No.

637
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,255
No, no, I..

638
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,344
I always thought he was gay.

639
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:15,056
Look, no one is suggesting that
you're responsible for what happened.

640
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,182
Oh. Thank you.

641
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,976
Survivors often experience
feelings of guilt.

642
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,312
Those feelings can be amplified

643
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,525
by the realization
that he let you live.

644
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,488
That he let me live?

645
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,784
Have you seen the video?

646
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,830
Do you really think
that's what it shows?

647
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,624
You are asking all
the wrong questions!

648
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:42,875
What should I be asking, Marta?

649
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,545
Has anyone looked at
Dr. Foite's blood work?

650
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:46,712
Have they?

651
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,590
I mean, that is the only thing that
is going to make any sense, here.

652
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,135
His behavior was..

653
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,512
Look, there are
projects at Sterisyn,

654
00:57:54,596 --> 00:58:00,143
defense projects that could
explain why he did what he did.

655
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:06,274
And people there are working
on behavioral design.

656
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:10,403
It's programmable
behavior, neural design.

657
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,324
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

658
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,787
I think he was exposed
to something at the lab.

659
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,373
Found it.

660
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,626
What are you doing?

661
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:30,548
That's my gun. What
the hell is this?

662
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,216
You're a potential suicide risk.

663
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,926
No. Wait a minute. How did you..

664
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,678
How did he find that? Marta..

665
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,139
No, no. Okay. This
meeting is now over.

666
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:41,392
I want you both out of
here, right now! Marta..

667
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,352
No! He has been snooping
around my house!

668
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,688
Marta, I want to
sign off here today!

669
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,607
I want to let you
get on that plane,

670
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,525
but you have got to help us out!

671
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:54,238
Look, we have got to
do our job here, okay?

672
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,157
We have got to go through this.

673
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,119
I need to know that you are calm
and safe before I leave here

674
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:04,123
and I need to know that you understand
the rules before you get on that plane.

675
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,752
Please, just..

676
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,381
Please, sit down and let us
get through our questions.

677
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,716
Okay.

678
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,435
Jesus! What is this?

679
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,938
What the hell is this? Ready?

680
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,481
Close. What are you doing?

681
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:29,857
Get off me!

682
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:30,983
Set?

683
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,653
Get the hell off me now! Set!

684
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,573
Green! No!

685
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,213
Gene!

686
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,548
A runner in the basement!

687
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:36,924
Go!

688
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,307
Connie! On your right.

689
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,238
One. Girl.

690
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,132
Find her.

691
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,676
Find her!

692
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:20,111
Gene! Talk to me!

693
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:55,271
Hey.

694
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,817
Unless you reloaded,
the gun is empty.

695
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,694
Look, look.

696
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,947
Dr. Shearing, it's me.

697
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,575
I'm not here to hurt you, okay?
How did you..

698
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,827
That was you! Yes. Shh!

699
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,501
Listen to me. Do
you want to live?

700
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:19,128
Look at me. Do you want to live?

701
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,379
Do you want to live? Yes.

702
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,714
Good. Let go of this gun.

703
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,299
How is this possible? Let go.

704
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,596
Take this.

705
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,097
Good.

706
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:33,559
Now, I need you to do
exactly what I say.

707
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,729
How is this possible? Listen to me.
Exactly what I say.

708
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,813
Understand? Yeah.

709
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,106
Good.

710
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:24,276
Hey, doc? I need my watch.

711
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,284
Doc, I need that watch!

712
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,832
Are there chems in this house?

713
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,042
Program medication.

714
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,126
Are they all dead?

715
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:42,253
Yeah, they're dead.

716
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,631
Look at me. Look at me. Do you
have program medication here?

717
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,715
What?

718
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,218
Chems. Greens, blues.
Do you have them here?

719
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,637
No, no. No?

720
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,930
Here? No, no. Here.

721
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,474
Where, then? Where
do you have them?

722
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,476
Where? Where do you
keep the chems?

723
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,061
I don't know.

724
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,522
Dr. Shearing, where are the chems?
I need the chems!

725
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,482
I understand, but I don't know.

726
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,280
It's not something.. We
do virology control.

727
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,073
So, all of that happens..

728
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:15,286
We don't have medication.

729
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,747
If I had any, I would
give it to you.

730
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,674
Okay, listen to me.

731
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,051
We have less than eight minutes
to clear out of here, okay?

732
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,804
Yes. Good.

733
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:37,725
Because the next thing
coming through that door

734
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,518
is going to wipe us out.

735
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,669
Can I get a sitrep, here?

736
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,798
If you can hear me,
pick up, Larry.

737
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,677
Larry, pick up.

738
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,516
Hey. Sorry about the tran.

739
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:23,062
What's our frame-rate, here?

740
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:26,482
Connie says about 10.
Just wrapping up.

741
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,275
Tell her we need a heads-up.
Okay?

742
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,401
Copy that.

743
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,493
Hey.

744
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,127
It's probably better
you did this.

745
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,318
Where are we going?

746
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,822
June. Your name is
June Monroe, say it.

747
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,115
June Monroe. Say it.

748
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,491
June Monroe.

749
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,617
Now pick a place you lived.

750
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,703
The last place you lived.
A place you know.

751
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,663
Bethesda. Bethesda,
that's where you live.

752
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,790
Anybody asks, you're June
Monroe from Bethesda.

753
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,292
You lost your wallet.
I'm driving you home.

754
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,169
My name is James. James
and June, you got it?

755
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:11,253
Yeah. Okay.

756
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,509
Is that your name?

757
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,719
James?

758
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,722
No. What? You don't
know my name?

759
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:26,226
What do you call me? What do
you put on my blood work?

760
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:27,311
Five.

761
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,396
Five? The number five?

762
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,901
Do you know how many
times we've met?

763
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,320
Thirteen.

764
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:38,447
Thirteen exams over
the last four years.

765
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,656
And that's what I get, a number?

766
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,533
Number Five. Okay.

767
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,744
Five of what, then?
How many are we?

768
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,370
Program participants?

769
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,538
That's what you call us?

770
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,166
There were nine. Then six.

771
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,502
Participants.

772
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,003
How did you find me?

773
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,171
Well, what do you think?

774
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,464
They're going to kill all of us

775
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,548
and then just leave
you guys alone?

776
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,801
You think your colleague
just went crazy?

777
01:08:58,885 --> 01:08:59,885
Is that what you think?

778
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:02,888
I didn't think anything. They
wound him up and set him loose.

779
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,849
I really have no idea
what is going on.

780
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,560
What's going on is they're
shutting the whole thing down.

781
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,229
Who is "they"?

782
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,065
I don't know.. Who were
the people at the house?

783
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,442
No, no, no, no. You
had your turn, okay?

784
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,821
You've been bleeding and scoping and
scraping me since the day we met.

785
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,073
It's my turn, now. I'm asking
the questions, you got it?

786
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,243
I need program meds, okay?
I need program meds.

787
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,036
Where do you keep the chems?

788
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,080
I don't have any. I've
already told you.

789
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:29,540
We don't have them. Bullshit.

790
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,124
Bullshit. It's bullshit.

791
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,334
I don't have any!

792
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,711
So, you don't know anything?
You're just the help?

793
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,464
That's why you have the big house
and the security clearance, right?

794
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,174
That's why they're trying
so hard to kill you,

795
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,467
because you don't know anything.

796
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:43,095
I know my job, which is science.

797
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:46,306
I don't know what you do
when you leave the lab.

798
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:47,933
None of us do! For four years!

799
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,018
Look, I want to get out! Would
you please stop the car?

800
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,186
You can't be that naive.

801
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,814
Would you let me out the car?
There's no way you're that naive!

802
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,696
You want out? Get out.
Go on, get out.

803
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,364
You don't have any chems. You
don't know where they are.

804
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,616
You don't know anything. That's fine.
Just get out.

805
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,535
But you got a plan, right?

806
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,870
Yeah, of course you do.
You're a doctor.

807
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,955
You've got this all
worked out, don't you?

808
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,623
What are you going to do?

809
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,667
Huh? What are you going to do?

810
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,253
You can't run, not alone.
You don't know how.

811
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:17,421
You certainly can't hide.

812
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:19,256
Not from people like this,
with the resources they have.

813
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,175
You won't make it to sundown.
So, what does that leave you?

814
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,636
You can go public, sure.
You can go loud.

815
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,014
Call your sister, because
that worked out well for you.

816
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,265
Call some ex-roommate.

817
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,100
Call a guy that knows a guy
at The Washington Post.

818
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,184
Put it online. 'Cause
you know what?

819
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,186
You blow me off, that's
the only play you've got.

820
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,149
But you'd better
ask yourself this.

821
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,818
Could you ever say it loud
enough or fast enough

822
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,363
that they'd be too afraid to
finish what they've started?

823
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,784
Now, I've got a plan, and it's
just not that complicated.

824
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,079
What I'm going to do is wait for the
next person to show up to kill you.

825
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,498
Maybe they can help me.

826
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,209
So, go for it.

827
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,548
I had no choice. I had
to get out of there.

828
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,884
No, I had to get out of there!

829
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,725
No, nobody. I have no idea.

830
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,479
You have to understand. All the
work at Outcome, all those tests,

831
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:17,898
the burn rates, dosage
panels, tissue stress.

832
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:21,151
I mean, that is us
tuning chemistry.

833
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,946
We don't fabricate anything.
That happens downstream.

834
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,405
Wait. What's that
mean, "downstream"?

835
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:28,283
It means you need live
virus to seed adhesion.

836
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:30,035
Cultures are highly reactive.

837
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,371
You have to process on-site and
we would never do it here.

838
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,705
Okay. On-site, where? Where?

839
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,207
Where do we hold the virus?

840
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,708
Yes!

841
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,710
Well, we can't drive there.

842
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,963
Where is it? Manila.

843
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,341
The Philippines.

844
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,745
Where do you stand
with your dosage?

845
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,750
I have 300 milligrams of blues.

846
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,961
It's not even enough
for another day.

847
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:23,005
I haven't had a full
green in 51 hours,

848
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,716
which is strange because I don't
feel physically degraded.

849
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,800
But we'll see.

850
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:27,968
Wait, wait, wait.

851
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:31,263
Did you just say you're
still taking greens?

852
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:32,431
What are you talking about?

853
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,560
You were viraled off physical
medication last year.

854
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,937
What?

855
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:44,776
Jesus. They viraled everyone
off greens eight months ago.

856
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,695
They infected you
with live virus,

857
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,196
which means that,
physically, you're stable.

858
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,781
You don't need to take greens.

859
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,285
They locked it in.

860
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:57,289
Any physical enhancement
is now permanent.

861
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,416
So, you infected me?

862
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,002
When was this?

863
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:04,796
Is this when I was sick?

864
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,132
The mystery flu? That was you?

865
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,552
Well, it wasn't me.
I didn't do it.

866
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,846
That was you. That was
on purpose, right?

867
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,264
When I almost died.

868
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,641
I'm sorry, but it wasn't me.

869
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,019
Why am I still taking
green pills, then?

870
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:21,646
I don't know. I thought
you had stopped.

871
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,815
Why am I asking you anything?

872
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,193
Or to keep us on a leash, right?

873
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,986
Is that it? To
keep a hold on us?

874
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,155
To keep us dependent?

875
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,700
Who tells you that this is okay?

876
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,368
No one.. I do..

877
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,411
Who says it's okay?

878
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:37,913
I do research.

879
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,626
I design, I survey. I
don't administer meds.

880
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,211
I don't make policy!

881
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,379
No, you just load the gun.

882
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,507
Oh, God.

883
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,010
Look, I was there
for the science.

884
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,305
We were all there for science.

885
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,059
And I know you don't care,
but I made a huge sacrifice.

886
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,811
I couldn't publish, I
couldn't conference.

887
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:03,480
I couldn't tell a single
person what it was I did.

888
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,067
But I thought I was helping my
country, and I know that's..

889
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,902
Tell me you can viral off blues.

890
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,532
Can you viral off blues?

891
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,367
Theoretically, yes.

892
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:16,660
Yeah.

893
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:19,162
Pills allow for temporary adhesion.
Okay.

894
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,124
To lock it in, you need live culture.
Live virus!

895
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,876
You know how to do that.

896
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,920
Do you know how to do that?

897
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,380
Yes. Okay.

898
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,758
Yes, but I told you, it's on
the other side of the planet.

899
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,845
Well, guess where we're going?

900
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:41,393
Welcome to Washington. Welcome
to Candent World Headquarters.

901
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:43,478
We want to make sure that
over the next few days

902
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,857
you have a chance to connect with the
people who have made Sterisyn Morlanta

903
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,526
the crown jewel in the
Candent group of companies.

904
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,654
Final Phase 3 testing approval
is expected this month

905
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:54,906
for both reQuiel
and Supressolyn.

906
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,201
Confidence is high that we're coming in
on schedule, and we want to be ready.

907
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,078
We know the market is eager.

908
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,580
We know, globally, the kind of..

909
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,420
What the hell don't
I know about this?

910
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:09,588
You're directing that at me?

911
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:12,007
That was a D-Trac team
we sent in there.

912
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,049
I don't know what that means.

913
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,217
It means they're good
at what they do.

914
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:15,427
I was told that
they were missing.

915
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:17,387
They don't just go missing.

916
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,097
What didn't you tell
us about this woman?

917
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,141
Nothing. She is who she is.
There's nothing to tell.

918
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:22,601
You vetted her up and down.

919
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:23,935
Then what the hell
are we looking at?

920
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,437
She has a registered gun.

921
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:26,897
They knew that going in.

922
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:28,398
She's got building permits.

923
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,942
Propane, welding tanks.
A stray bullet?

924
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:32,235
You want to keep guessing?

925
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,403
We've got to get in there.

926
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,447
I've got a dozen people
waiting on the perimeter.

927
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:36,615
We don't control the site?

928
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:37,782
Not yet.

929
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:38,950
Getting the picture now?

930
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,076
Okay, stop!

931
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,328
I can't run this from here.

932
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,872
I need a crisis suite. I need
integrated grids and comms.

933
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:44,956
I need all of it.

934
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,875
NSA, or Pentagon, or
Liberty Crossing.

935
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,919
I don't care, just get
me something now.

936
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,545
Pack up your codes
and your drives,

937
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:51,713
and whatever else
you're going to need.

938
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:53,131
We're going to move and
we're going to stay there.

939
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,635
Dita, how am I putting a net over that house?
There's locals all over it.

940
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,136
We go with germs.

941
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,096
She took samples from work.

942
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,349
Pathogens, viruses.
It's national security.

943
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,808
Good, okay, I like
that, it plays.

944
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,352
Now, get it out there,
get it out there.

945
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:08,021
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Everybody find another gear, okay?

946
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,814
Because I want to be
out of here in 20.

947
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,194
So, let's say you want to
change the human body.

948
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:15,695
You want to fix a mistake.

949
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,324
You want to repair something,
improve something.

950
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,244
Well, if you're going to reprogram
human genetic material,

951
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,705
you need a delivery system, and
nothing works better than virus.

952
01:16:25,957 --> 01:16:27,249
It's like a suitcase.

953
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,418
You pack in genetic mutation,

954
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:35,507
infect the body and the vector
unloads into the target cells.

955
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:40,053
But getting it where you
want it, how you want it,

956
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:41,221
is the nightmare.

957
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,515
Unless you have a map.

958
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:48,687
There was this terrible accident
at Fort Detrick in 1985.

959
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,775
Five researchers dropped dead in the
lab, and it was such a catastrophe

960
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,235
that they brought
in Dan Hillcott

961
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,029
from Stanford to
assess the damage.

962
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:02,617
He got in there and he realized
that, underneath it all,

963
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:07,706
was this incredible breakthrough
in viral-receptor mapping.

964
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:09,708
He had a map.

965
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,421
You've had some very
minor alterations

966
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,214
made to two different
chromosomes.

967
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,300
The green side, the
physical side,

968
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,510
is nothing more than
a 1 .5 percent rise

969
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,305
in your mitochondrial
protein uptake.

970
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,181
But with 1 .5 percent,

971
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:29,686
you see this immediate
increase in cellular tempo,

972
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,522
muscle efficiency, oxygenation..

973
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,732
And the blue side?

974
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,234
Intelligence, obviously,
but it's more than that.

975
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,654
It's neural regeneration
and elasticity.

976
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:43,700
Sensory function.
Pain suppression.

977
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,329
It's the most exciting
development in genomic targeting

978
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,706
in the history of the science.

979
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,936
My God.

980
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:19,903
Hey, how do I get monitor
71 up on the big screen?

981
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,279
Coming up.

982
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,451
They found a body.

983
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,120
They're pretty sure it's a woman,
and it's not Marta Shearing.

984
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,663
They found dog tags.

985
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,457
They think she was shot.

986
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:50,600
Hey.

987
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,313
Marta, I..

988
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,192
You can't call anyone.

989
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:05,824
There are people that care about
you that think you're dead.

990
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,367
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

991
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:10,328
Anyone you contact
becomes a target.

992
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:17,001
So, you need to put aside any normal
emotional response that you have.

993
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:22,841
The only edge we've got right now
is they think we're both gone.

994
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,510
All right?

995
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,388
All right.

996
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:33,935
So,

997
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:36,062
you're going to want
to go through this.

998
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:49,033
You know, just be
familiar with it.

999
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,253
June Monroe.

1000
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,714
Who is June Monroe?

1001
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,883
You are.

1002
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,225
Do you know her?

1003
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,064
Not anymore.

1004
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,198
Why do you have
to stay enhanced?

1005
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,454
Why is it so important to you?

1006
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,337
Come here.

1007
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,278
What is this?

1008
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,447
This was me.

1009
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,576
Was.

1010
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,497
My army recruiter

1011
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,542
was looking to make his quota.

1012
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,418
He added 12 points to my IQ.

1013
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,300
Twelve points to
make the minimum.

1014
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:41,646
You ever seen a cognitive
degrade, Marta?

1015
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,649
Sensory withdrawal?
You ever do that?

1016
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,611
Pull someone's blues and watch
them drop off their meds?

1017
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,029
No.

1018
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,825
Because they paint a pretty
graphic picture in training.

1019
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,830
Hell of a long way to fall.

1020
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:05,003
If I can't keep it together,
we won't make it.

1021
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,845
They bit. Who?

1022
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,055
Washington Post.

1023
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,683
We just flagged an email.

1024
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,977
They're going with the story
about the possible theft

1025
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,812
of the dangerous
materials from the lab.

1026
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:27,150
Wow, they took it. They already
flagged a DWI conviction.

1027
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:28,359
That's convenient.

1028
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,362
They found another body.
One of ours.

1029
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,198
They're picking up shell
casings all over the place.

1030
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:36,659
I don't think your
doctor's in there.

1031
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,253
Boarding pass and ID, please.

1032
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,763
Thank you. Thank you.

1033
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:41,099
Boarding pass and ID, please.

1034
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,237
Where are you?

1035
01:23:54,405 --> 01:23:56,114
I'm right behind you.
Don't turn around.

1036
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:58,700
You're going to stay right here

1037
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,411
until it's time to board, okay?
You're doing great.

1038
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,497
You see that corridor
on your right?

1039
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:05,665
You're gonna want
to find somebody

1040
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,625
who's walking that way
and just tag along.

1041
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:09,377
Keep moving, keep
your head down,

1042
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,461
and I'll see you on the plane.

1043
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,005
Aaron?

1044
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:14,757
Hello?

1045
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,348
The trail is
definitive and fresh.

1046
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,517
The canine team tracked
her from her house

1047
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,603
through this wooded area, ending
here, at this little parking lot.

1048
01:24:27,771 --> 01:24:30,648
Either she had a car waiting for
her, or somebody picked her up.

1049
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,443
There are security cameras on the
street, but there's nothing back here.

1050
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,194
There's got to be
satellite footage.

1051
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,739
Maryland's not exactly a
high-value U.S. target.

1052
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,073
There'll be plenty
of weather imaging,

1053
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:40,283
but we're gonna have to
swing a little wider

1054
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:41,659
to find something real-time
that's enhanceable.

1055
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,703
We're draining some foreign platforms.
We need about an hour.

1056
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,997
Come on, she's not pulling
this off on her own.

1057
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,957
Who the hell is helping her?

1058
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:54,255
We'll find out more
in the next hour,

1059
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,923
while we are currently in court.

1060
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:57,008
Now back to Jenn.

1061
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,096
The FBI this morning confirmed
reports that Dr. Albert Hirsch

1062
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:05,516
died of heart failure in a
Washington, D.C. hotel.

1063
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,603
Dr. Hirsch had been expected
to testify yesterday

1064
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,438
before a Senate
intelligence committee.

1065
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,107
That select committee
is investigating links

1066
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:16,611
between a troubled CIA
program known as Treadstone

1067
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,446
and this man, Jason Bourne.

1068
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,199
Police and federal officials
are searching for Bourne

1069
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,452
in connection with recent shootings
in New York and in London.

1070
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,455
Dr. Hirsch had been cooperating
with the Justice Department

1071
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,374
and was in protective custody
at the time of the incident.

1072
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,376
A committee spokesman
told reporters last night

1073
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,379
that the hearings will
be postponed temporarily

1074
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,423
as they evaluate the
loss of Doctor..

1075
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:03,491
Hi, folks.

1076
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,326
Just going to remind you
to keep the aisles clear

1077
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,786
for any baggage during
takeoff and landing.

1078
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,704
Excuse me. Thank you.

1079
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,122
Pardon me, sir.

1080
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:16,838
Sir, do you need help
finding your seat?

1081
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,965
Sir? No, I got it.

1082
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:39,610
You see those two shadows? One of them is her.
That's the parking lot.

1083
01:26:39,987 --> 01:26:42,530
One of them stops.
Here comes the car.

1084
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,199
Where is this from? It's a
Canadian forestry satellite.

1085
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,327
Here comes the other one into
the car, and there they go.

1086
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,121
- Where?
- We lose them east.

1087
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,456
Our window drops out about
two miles up the road.

1088
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,791
But we've got the silhouette.

1089
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,043
We've got surveillance footage,
racked and ready to go.

1090
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,880
We're going to split teams, find
this car and link up a trail.

1091
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,464
With a 17-hour head start?

1092
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:03,050
Where the hell can she go?

1093
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:19,859
We're looking for a
Buick LeSabre 2002.

1094
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,320
I've got an NIA/Homeland
warrant, that's why.

1095
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,323
Well, you give us what you have..
Two passengers.

1096
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:30,369
It's an '02 burgundy LeSabre
starting west from Lisbon, Maryland.

1097
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,622
Tolls, exits, service stations.

1098
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:34,457
Give me every camera you've got.

1099
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,667
I'm seeing an FBI camera
bin on my list here.

1100
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:37,960
No, no. Traffic only.

1101
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,296
West, Lisbon. L-I-S-B-O-N.

1102
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,758
Yes, we want all of that and the toll cams.
We want everything.

1103
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,302
We'll take them all. Whatever
hits you have, send them on.

1104
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:47,720
We will work on
sorting them out.

1105
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:14,789
Wilmington, Delaware.

1106
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:19,251
This is our car, the LeSabre. We
see it coming into the structure.

1107
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,297
It goes under, comes back
around, and it parks here.

1108
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,966
But it doesn't come out.

1109
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,844
This is inside. It's four
minutes after arrival.

1110
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:30,054
It's her.

1111
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,056
Do we know what she's doing?

1112
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,059
She was having her
passport picture taken.

1113
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:46,278
Logan, Hartford, LaGuardia,
Kennedy, Philly, Newark,

1114
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,905
Dulles, Reagan.

1115
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,408
We start with yesterday
morning, that is our wedge.

1116
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,743
We clear that, and then
we move up the clock.

1117
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,248
She wants to know if you want
Hartford, because she can get it.

1118
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:42,418
Blue coat, second row.
She's got a red bag.

1119
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:43,586
Which one? I have four.

1120
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:47,423
All right, I have TSA
Authorization 1, 6, 9 and 12.

1121
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:49,425
Airports given, all departures.

1122
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,635
Yes, the international
terminal first.

1123
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,107
We're almost there.

1124
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,991
So, check out the newsstand.

1125
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,159
There.

1126
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:16,577
I don't know.

1127
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:20,206
Logan has a face we need to
look at, but there's kids.

1128
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,333
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Hang on.

1129
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,877
Stop.

1130
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,175
Where is this?

1131
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,510
Kennedy. Okay.

1132
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,442
I've never been here at night.
I don't know the rules.

1133
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,320
There are no rules, okay?

1134
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:55,199
We belong here. Come on.

1135
01:30:58,745 --> 01:30:59,954
Hey, how are you?

1136
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:01,664
Good evening.

1137
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,542
Dr. Shearing and I are here
to open up the lab, please.

1138
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,586
Sir? What's all this?

1139
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,047
Hi, how are you?

1140
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:13,843
Dr. Shearing! Dr. Shearing.

1141
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,220
Hey, it's me, Joseph.

1142
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:18,264
Joseph!

1143
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,391
Hello, how are you?

1144
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:21,809
I'm good, I'm good.

1145
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,395
Welcome back. Thanks.

1146
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,981
I'm sorry. I just don't have
you on my list arriving.

1147
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,066
That's because we had
to change our schedule.

1148
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:30,776
Yeah, we took an earlier flight.

1149
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:34,029
Joseph, I'm Dr. Brundage, by the way.
It's nice to meet you.

1150
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:38,075
Pleased to meet you, too, but Dr. Pumaloy
is not here, he went to Singapore.

1151
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:39,326
He just left yesterday.

1152
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:41,996
The girls have gone home.
No one told me anything.

1153
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,456
Right. Well, I understand.

1154
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,250
Well, look, we're going
to be here all week,

1155
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,710
and we have a lot of work to do,

1156
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,211
so we need to get
in there tonight

1157
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:50,337
and get things started, okay?

1158
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,131
Yeah, of course,
it's just that..

1159
01:31:52,299 --> 01:31:53,924
You can call Dr. Pumaloy
if you want.

1160
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,176
I just don't want to
put you on the spot.

1161
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,469
No, we don't have to do that.

1162
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,180
Okay, great.

1163
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,268
It's just the two of you?

1164
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,603
Yeah.

1165
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:08,355
Yes, correct.

1166
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:09,773
Correct.

1167
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:12,818
Yes, I will hold.

1168
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,779
Get it up there. Put that
up on the big screen.

1169
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:18,782
Yes, I'm here.

1170
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:21,869
Good. Where?

1171
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,830
I need an immediate upload
on that passenger manifest.

1172
01:32:24,998 --> 01:32:27,166
I know. Here she is, I'm
putting her back on.

1173
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:30,461
Manila. She took
American 167 to Manila.

1174
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:32,087
She landed 45 minutes ago.

1175
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:16,715
Aaron.

1176
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,801
Are you okay?

1177
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,817
There's 243 people
on that plane.

1178
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,819
We're going to scope every
one of them right now.

1179
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:39,154
So, pick a face that you
like, pull it down,

1180
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:40,823
and deselect it if
you've cleared it.

1181
01:33:40,991 --> 01:33:42,783
If there is anything that
smells wrong to you,

1182
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,160
if there's a hair out of
place that you don't like,

1183
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:46,370
you do not clear it.

1184
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,456
You flag it and you send it over
to Dita and we'll check it out.

1185
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:54,503
We have to be working off the same grid.
That's Homeland 9.5.

1186
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,006
If you don't pull that
access, raise your hand,

1187
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,091
Colonel Hardy's going to
come over and sort you out.

1188
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:11,562
So, this is it, huh?

1189
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,355
Yeah.

1190
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:17,901
Okay.

1191
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,237
What the hell are
we into, Terry?

1192
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,572
I don't know.

1193
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,407
It's your shop. What is
going on over there?

1194
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:24,783
What did I say? I don't know.

1195
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:26,577
Well, how many trips has
she made over there?

1196
01:34:26,745 --> 01:34:28,495
Five, six, I don't know.
Why the Philippines?

1197
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:30,622
Hey, hey, hey!

1198
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,920
Seat 13-B. Karl D.
Brundage, 13-B.

1199
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,215
I need support staff
to clear the room.

1200
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:44,720
Stand up and walk, now.

1201
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,851
Jack, Cathy, move! Let's go.

1202
01:34:58,485 --> 01:34:59,610
Who the hell is he?

1203
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,113
He's an Outcome agent.

1204
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,281
That's Outcome 5.

1205
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,784
They're not dead? I
thought they were dead!

1206
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,203
Yeah, he's supposed to be dead.

1207
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:11,747
Then what's he doing there?
I don't know.

1208
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:13,123
He's looking for meds.

1209
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,375
What?

1210
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,877
That's where the chems come from.
What else would he be doing?

1211
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,420
She's got to be helping him.

1212
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:20,089
But how? How is that possible?

1213
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:23,092
I don't know how. I don't care.

1214
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:24,927
He's alive, they're there.

1215
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:27,388
"How" doesn't really
matter, does it?

1216
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,432
The only mission we've got now
is to drop a bag over this.

1217
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,267
Are the drugs he's looking
for there, or not?

1218
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,812
Jesus, I don't.. Terry?

1219
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,397
No. No, there's nothing there.

1220
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:37,940
We haven't made a
run in 16 weeks.

1221
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:39,608
Besides, we wouldn't store
the pills there, anyway.

1222
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,943
It's basically a kitchen.

1223
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:43,195
We tweak the recipe and we bake
up a batch when we need it.

1224
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:44,655
Then what the hell
are they doing?

1225
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,615
The stems are there.

1226
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:50,953
She's going to try
to viral him out.

1227
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,403
Thank you.

1228
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,044
Mack. Yeah?

1229
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,256
Plant office, Mackie speaking.

1230
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:46,300
Mr. Mackie, this
is Terrance Ward.

1231
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,595
I'm the Senior Vice-President
for Candent Precision Metrics.

1232
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,722
I'm calling from Maryland.
Yes, sir.

1233
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,057
We have a potential
security incident.

1234
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:56,477
I just posted two photographs
on the company network.

1235
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,937
I need to know if either of these
two people have tried to enter..

1236
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,272
Yeah, we're on it.

1237
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:01,773
Excuse me?

1238
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:04,902
Yeah, we're on the case. We're just here
now trying to figure out who to call.

1239
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,196
Our gatehouse just
passed in two doctors.

1240
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,614
I think one of them
might be that woman

1241
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:09,948
from your shoot-out over there.

1242
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,450
Well, where are they now?

1243
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,494
We keep all of our
client labs downstairs,

1244
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:15,746
so we're assuming they've
gone into the basement.

1245
01:37:15,914 --> 01:37:17,664
I just sent a couple of
boys down to check it out.

1246
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,000
No, no. No, no,
withdraw your team.

1247
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,127
Lock the lab and keep
them down there.

1248
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:24,338
Do not try to take him.

1249
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:30,385
Hello?

1250
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:32,262
Hey, how you doing?
Can I help you?

1251
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:33,430
Are you alone down here?

1252
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:34,598
Aaron?

1253
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:36,433
Hey, guys.

1254
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,769
You can't be down here. Do you
have clearance for this level?

1255
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,853
Nobody's supposed
to be down here.

1256
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:41,855
I'm supposed to be down here.
I'm Dr. Shearing.

1257
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,273
We're in the middle
of a sampling audit.

1258
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:44,399
It is not safe for
you guys to be here.

1259
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:45,651
Let's straighten
this out upstairs.

1260
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:47,361
Don't touch that.
Pack it up, let's go.

1261
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:48,946
Look, nobody touch anything.
Come on, just follow us.

1262
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,490
I'm not going to sit here and argue with you.
I'm going to call your boss

1263
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,075
and we're gonna figure it out.
Watch her.

1264
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:54,826
Hey, hold on a second.

1265
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:14,179
I'm going to get my bag.
We got to go.

1266
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:16,139
Okay.

1267
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:20,227
Wait. This way.

1268
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:22,104
I don't know where this goes.
Just open it.

1269
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:30,112
Step back.

1270
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:45,210
Lock it down. Hey! You! You! With me!
Come on, come on, come on.

1271
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,510
Is that locked? Yes, sir.

1272
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,137
No one in, no one out.
Do you understand?

1273
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:58,724
Hey, what happened to those
three guys you sent downstairs?

1274
01:38:58,891 --> 01:38:59,975
Shit.

1275
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:03,687
Come with me. You stay there, okay?
Stay there.

1276
01:39:04,981 --> 01:39:06,481
We belong here.

1277
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:16,491
Coming through.

1278
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,013
You, go and get everyone else.
Tell them to go around the front.

1279
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,973
Go through the eastern doors,
move around the front.

1280
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:50,609
Move! Move, people!

1281
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,904
Who have you got on this radio?
Why is no one responding?

1282
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,364
Is that gate shut?

1283
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,367
Excuse me. Move, move, move!

1284
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,577
Hey! I need that gate shut!

1285
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:03,830
Hey, you! Listen, go down to the main gate.
Do you understand?

1286
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,374
No one in, no one out.

1287
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:06,667
Hey, what are you doing?

1288
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,335
Just get down to the main
gate with everyone else.

1289
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:12,673
All right, get back! Stay back!

1290
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,716
Give him some room.

1291
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:17,803
All right, give me some room.
Give me some room, please.

1292
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,389
He's going to need a doctor.

1293
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:24,893
Security. Security!

1294
01:40:25,895 --> 01:40:26,895
Over here, please.

1295
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,023
Over here.

1296
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,734
Sir, can you hear me? Sir!

1297
01:40:40,076 --> 01:40:41,535
He can't get far.

1298
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:43,995
If he didn't viral out, he's
going to run out of brain.

1299
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,289
And, if he did, then he's
going to be too sick to move.

1300
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,083
So, we just have
to find him fast

1301
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,876
and kill him, once and for all.

1302
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,503
Can we talk about LARX?

1303
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:54,214
LARX?

1304
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,591
LARX-3 is in Bangkok.
It's a two-hour flight.

1305
01:40:56,759 --> 01:40:59,219
Wait a minute. Just
hang on, here.

1306
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:02,055
I thought that was
just a proposal.

1307
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,599
Get him out there.

1308
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,105
LARX is a beta-2 stem program.

1309
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,774
Amped mission fidelity,
minimized empathy.

1310
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,318
It's Treadstone without
the inconsistency,

1311
01:41:15,403 --> 01:41:17,738
Outcome without the
emotional noise.

1312
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,531
It's looking very strong for us.

1313
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:22,993
We have never seen
evaluations like this.

1314
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:25,245
This went from something
I don't know about

1315
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,663
to something on the
drawing board,

1316
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:28,623
and now you're telling
me it's up and running?

1317
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:31,293
It's up and running.
Consider yourself informed.

1318
01:42:18,716 --> 01:42:20,801
Are you comfortable?

1319
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:22,844
Yes, sir.

1320
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,347
You don't look comfortable.

1321
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:28,683
No, sir.

1322
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:32,562
What's your name?

1323
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,234
Kenneth James.

1324
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,778
Full name, Kenneth.

1325
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:42,697
Kenneth.. James..

1326
01:42:43,783 --> 01:42:44,783
Kitsom.

1327
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:46,284
They have a room.

1328
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:49,704
Can you walk?

1329
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:52,082
Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

1330
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:09,766
Where are you from, Kenneth?

1331
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,309
When?

1332
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:13,603
Before you enlisted.

1333
01:43:15,064 --> 01:43:16,273
Berwin.

1334
01:43:17,108 --> 01:43:18,733
Ls that a town?

1335
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:22,404
Berwin.. it's a state home.

1336
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:23,530
What state?

1337
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,409
In Reno.

1338
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:28,869
Ls this a test?

1339
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:30,328
Yes, it is.

1340
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:39,296
If I pass, can I stay here?

1341
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,463
Do you want to stay?

1342
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:41,631
Yes, sir.

1343
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,133
That's good to know.

1344
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:57,480
Okay. Okay.

1345
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:02,193
Okay, just lie still.

1346
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:03,820
Aaron, you have.. Aaron..

1347
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:13,663
What?

1348
01:44:17,376 --> 01:44:21,463
There's $40,000 in the
lining of my jacket.

1349
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:25,467
In this bag, there
are passports.

1350
01:44:25,635 --> 01:44:27,719
Two blanks and three ghosts,
there's that guy's watch.

1351
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:29,721
There are other things, okay?
You take it.

1352
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:33,975
Look at me.

1353
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:36,519
You can make it.

1354
01:44:37,021 --> 01:44:38,188
You're a warrior.

1355
01:44:40,691 --> 01:44:42,192
You can make it.

1356
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,402
Okay? Stay small.

1357
01:44:44,737 --> 01:44:46,196
No airports.

1358
01:44:46,364 --> 01:44:48,657
Just blend in like
you know, okay?

1359
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,371
You've done enough for me.

1360
01:44:54,497 --> 01:44:55,538
No, I..

1361
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:57,540
Please go.

1362
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,584
You've done enough for me.

1363
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:15,058
Everything's in the car.

1364
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:14,117
Ls this a test?

1365
01:46:14,243 --> 01:46:15,452
Yes, it is.

1366
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:19,789
If I pass, can I stay here?

1367
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:21,458
Do you want to stay?

1368
01:46:57,495 --> 01:46:59,537
Paracetamol, 500 milligrams.

1369
01:46:59,789 --> 01:47:00,955
Four times a day.

1370
01:47:07,797 --> 01:47:09,005
For free. This is free.

1371
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:10,215
Okay, good.

1372
01:47:17,556 --> 01:47:18,890
I'll be right back.

1373
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:37,260
Aaron, run!

1374
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:21,846
"Where are you?"

1375
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:24,307
"Was that the signal?"

1376
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,142
They're asking for confirmation.

1377
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:29,479
"You went too soon." No..
"We went too soon."

1378
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:30,647
Come on.

1379
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,416
It's okay.

1380
01:51:22,634 --> 01:51:23,718
Police! Police!

1381
01:52:00,089 --> 01:52:01,089
Get down!

1382
01:52:10,974 --> 01:52:11,974
Are you okay?

1383
01:52:12,184 --> 01:52:13,184
Yeah.

1384
01:52:13,936 --> 01:52:15,478
Good. Come on.

1385
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:13,703
Get down, get down.

1386
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:19,375
Climb over.

1387
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,043
Go. Get over, get
over, get over.

1388
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:22,587
Get over. Hang on tight.

1389
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:29,260
Go, go!

1390
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:32,054
You ready? Let go!

1391
01:53:59,917 --> 01:54:01,918
Okay. Take this.

1392
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,587
Just keep walking, don't look back.
Go, go.

1393
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:36,786
Hey, hey. Get on.

1394
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:38,663
You ever ridden before? No.

1395
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:39,747
Take this.

1396
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,666
Police, police!

1397
01:54:44,127 --> 01:54:46,003
Hang on tight and
follow me, okay?

1398
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:47,630
Stay with me.

1399
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:47,857
He's got a gun!

1400
01:55:57,534 --> 01:55:58,701
Keep your head down.

1401
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:59,910
It's not a cop.

1402
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:30,024
Aaron!

1403
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:10,786
You've been shot.
It's all right.

1404
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:12,496
Pull over!

1405
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:14,415
Pull over.

1406
02:00:14,583 --> 02:00:16,792
We just have to
get to the water.

1407
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:20,045
Can you check that for me?

1408
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:21,130
How long is that going to take?

1409
02:00:21,590 --> 02:00:22,590
Come on.

1410
02:00:22,674 --> 02:00:23,674
We'll get back to you.

1411
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:25,551
Anything?

1412
02:00:26,011 --> 02:00:27,511
No.

1413
02:00:27,888 --> 02:00:28,888
The cops are out.

1414
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,557
They lost the trail.

1415
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:45,154
Aaron!

1416
02:01:26,029 --> 02:01:27,863
Aaron! Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!

1417
02:01:44,923 --> 02:01:53,639
Are you okay?

1418
02:01:53,807 --> 02:01:55,808
Yeah? Yeah.

1419
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:18,080
Can you help us?

1420
02:02:24,295 --> 02:02:26,255
Please.

1421
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:31,260
Should be up there now.

1422
02:02:33,263 --> 02:02:35,097
He said it's the room where
they spent the night.

1423
02:02:52,323 --> 02:02:55,451
Well, we had a problem with
Treadstone six years ago.

1424
02:02:56,036 --> 02:02:57,703
The Blackbriar program,

1425
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:00,873
detailed in the operations
report you have before you,

1426
02:03:00,957 --> 02:03:02,875
was activated solely to capture

1427
02:03:02,959 --> 02:03:04,877
a Treadstone operative
gone rogue.

1428
02:03:07,547 --> 02:03:08,714
Pam, what are you going to do?

1429
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:10,340
We have nothing for you now.

1430
02:03:10,508 --> 02:03:12,217
I don't know Pamela
Landy's reasons

1431
02:03:12,302 --> 02:03:14,970
for criminally assisting an
enemy of the United States.

1432
02:03:15,138 --> 02:03:18,932
But the fact is, she lacked
the operational clearance

1433
02:03:19,017 --> 02:03:23,062
to access, much less interpret,
the information you have

1434
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:24,563
in the classified
file before you.

1435
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:26,857
Pam, there's a rumor that you're
going to be indicted, is it true?

1436
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:28,484
Mike, can you comment?
Have you been subpoenaed?

1437
02:03:28,568 --> 02:03:30,235
We're here voluntarily.
We came for a meeting.

1438
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,612
Have you had any contact
with Jason Bourne?

1439
02:03:31,696 --> 02:03:33,238
Did you receive a
target letter or not?

1440
02:03:33,323 --> 02:03:34,406
Are we going to
see you tomorrow?

1441
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:36,575
I just thank God that there
were hands steady enough

1442
02:03:36,743 --> 02:03:40,162
to make sure that the documents
she tried to shop to the press

1443
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:41,955
were contained before they could

1444
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,582
do any more harm than
they already have.

1445
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:46,418
Are you still scheduled to appear at
the House Intelligence Committee?

1446
02:03:46,503 --> 02:03:49,338
Yes, I am. Look, anything else is going
to have to come from my attorneys, okay?

1447
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:50,923
Do you regret your
earlier statement?

1448
02:03:51,091 --> 02:03:53,842
I regret a lot of things. I'm not
sure that one is on the list.

1449
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:55,010
Thank you, guys.

1450
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:48,981
Hey.

1451
02:04:51,568 --> 02:04:53,068
Are we lost?

1452
02:04:54,154 --> 02:04:55,821
No.

1453
02:04:56,573 --> 02:04:58,907
Just looking at our options.

1454
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:05,289
I was kind of hoping
we were lost.

1455
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:04,000
