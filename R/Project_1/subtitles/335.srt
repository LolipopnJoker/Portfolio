2
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:33,216
Quiet!

3
00:00:41,872 --> 00:00:43,859
What are you?

4
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:45,809
Sh..!

5
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:47,396
Oh?

6
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:03,385
Ah! You're a demon!

7
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,485
Sh! Sh! Sh!

8
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,630
No.no. I'm not a demon.
I'm not a demon.

9
00:01:07,245 --> 00:01:09,465
See? Just a guy.
Just a guy,

10
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:11,278
here to rescue these
dragons, so... um..

11
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:12,953
But you walked thorugh fire!

12
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:15,268
Dragon scales.
Dragons shed a lot.

13
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,288
Oh, I know a demon
when I see one!

14
00:01:17,313 --> 00:01:19,137
No human legs
are that skinny!

15
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,734
That's a good entrance.
Get a load of me!

16
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,505
Ahh! Ahh!

17
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,757
- Ah!
- I knew it! More demons!

18
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:30,826
That's really just a nit wit 
who forgot to fireproof his butt.

19
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,919
Guys! Go!
Not yet!

20
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:35,327
Ah!

21
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,825
- Behold, your worst nightmare..
- Behold!

22
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,769
...along with his sister
 who insisted on coming.

23
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:42,068
That's my intro?

24
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:43,693
Guys, too soon.

25
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,868
You always come in too soon.

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,611
Sorry, still getting
the hang of my wings.

27
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,604
Fishlegs, again with the baby?

28
00:01:52,865 --> 00:01:55,338
- This is a raid!
- I couldn't find a 'sitter.

29
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,969
Demons everywhere!
It's the end of the world!

30
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,515


31
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:03,349
Astrid, I had him right
 where I wanted him.

32
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,527
And now, he's right
 where I wanted him.

33
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,480
- Let's get to work.
- Okay. We screwed that up.

34
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:10,618
But at least nobody
else knows we're here.

35
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,551
Easy, girl.
It's okay.

36
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,457
Sh! Sh! Sh!
I'm gonna get you out of here.

37
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:24,957
 The Crimson goregutter?

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,795
Oh-ho!

39
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:32,280
Oh-ho! Look at this weirdo.

40
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,294
That's super dumb.

41
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,973
Why can't I get
this cage open?

42
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:39,497
It slides.

43
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:42,173
- Obviously.
- Attack!

44
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,929
Get the rescued out of here!

45
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,584
No running on the deck!

46
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:53,174
It's slippery.
You can fall.

47
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,699
Step aside!  Let me handle
 the tough guy stuff!

48
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,904
Ha-ha! 
That's two for me.

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,674
You look out!

50
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,098
- Sorry.
- Oh!

51
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,595
Whoo! Thank you.

52
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,573
Go get the rest, bud.

53
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:25,227
I thought this was supposed
to be a stealth mission.

54
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,331
- Yeah, they always start that way.
- Look out!

55
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,154
Thanks, Stormfly!

56
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,851
Oh, stop worring.
They'll get it.

57
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,843
Run!

58
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:42,996
Eventually.

59
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:45,403
Move out!
We got 'em all.

60
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,547
I'm gonna headlock
every last one of you.

61
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:49,448
I might even leglock you.

62
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,599
Ha-ha!

63
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,046
Amateurs! I was just
 getting started.

64
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,937
Clear out, guys!
Go! Go!

65
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:03,698


66
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,665
Toothless, time to go!

67
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:15,506
Oh!

68
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:17,284
- Hey, guys.
- Ha-ha.

69
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:24,919
You've always
 had my back, bud.

70
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,531
This is Berk.

71
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:45,448
Your new home
 away from home.

72
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:49,280
A stunning, one-stop,all expense
 paid dream destination.

73
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,655
So settle in and let your
worries melt-away!

74
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,798
The service here's sourced,

75
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:59,243
cuisine's fiery,

76
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:02,879
and the locals are as
colorful as you get.

77
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:07,595
Any run-of-the-mill paradise
poses beaches and sunshine..

78
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:09,860
Well, not us.

79
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,460
We've got something
no one else can touch.

80
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,040
We, my friend,..

81
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,602
..have dragons.

82
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:19,846
- Incoming!
- Lots and lots...

83
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,588
..of dragons.

84
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,547


85
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:32,847
Gang, meet our
 latest Berkians.

86
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,141
Welcome to paradise, mate!

87
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:39,146
Oh, aren't you a beauty?

88
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:41,196
Ah, you're welcome!
You're welcome!

89
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:43,243
I took on, like, 
a hundred trappers---

90
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,833
 a-- a thousand trappers!

91
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,282
All with burning undies.

92
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:49,445
My thick, full beard
almost caught on fire.

93
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,423
Oh, just--
 Just stop.

94
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,451
So, uh, Hiccup's mom,

95
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,211
any notes on my
bone crushing assault,

96
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:56,936
or was it pretty 
much perfect?

97
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:59,396
Oh, it was indescribable.

98
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,713
And please, call me Valka.

99
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,150
- It has been a year.
- First name basis.

100
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:07,021
I think the real hero of
the day was Toothless,

101
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,782
isn't that right, bud?

102
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:12,008
What would we do without
you ,oh, king of dragons?

103
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:12,932
What would we do?

104
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,546
Well, we could train
a lot harder, for one.

105
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:17,533
That was pretty sloppy.

106
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,173
Astrid, uh, does have a point.

107
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,989
Perhaps you all rely a little
bit too much on your dragons and

108
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,479
not enough on one another.

109
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:29,127
See, that's exactly what I was saying.
Just listen up, guys.

110
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:31,920
Yeah, your mom's super
impressed with me.

111
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:33,922
I'm like the son
she always wanted.

112
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,269
Fishmeat!

113
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:38,208
You've found a new friend.

114
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,460
- Mind your heads!
- Oh!

115
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,878
Oh!

116
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,833
What good is having
the king of dragons around

117
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:06,388
if he can't keep the order?

118
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:09,178
Hey, bud, do you wanna, uh,
do something here, or..

119
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:18,545
And where do you suppose
we put these ones?

120
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,346
Yeah, we'll make room.

121
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:21,601
Ah!

122
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,023
You brought back
 a hobgobbler?

123
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,368
They're a bad omen.
We're cursed!

124
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,493
- Ha-ha.
- Nonsense!

125
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,741
What harm could he do?

126
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:34,991
No injuries. Little shaken,
but otherwise  healthy.

127
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,719
Now, who's hungry?

128
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,066
Point is, you can't keep
bringing dragons back here!

129
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,023
- Yah!
- Come on, boy.

130
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,768
You're just asking for trouble.

131
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:51,379
Don't kill it, okay?

132
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,681
Those trappers are
getting closer by the day.

133
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,115
We can handle them.
We have The alpha.

134
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:57,669
Ain't that right, bud?

135
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,646
Would you look at
 how happy they are?

136
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:01,170
She's..

137
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:02,868
..awesome.

138
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,399
Gobber, relax.
We did it.

139
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,142
The world's first
dragon-viking utopia.

140
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,787
We made the dream
 a reality.

141
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,523
Your dream, maybe..

142
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,412
Mine's less crowded and more--

143
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,560
Aah! Sanitary.

144
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,451
Gobber, you're not fooling anybody.

145
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,112
I know you love them.

146
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:28,049
You're supposed to be the generation
that lead us into the future.

147
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:30,840
Ha-ha!
Food fight!

148
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:33,721
Mm... gorgeous!

149
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:35,436
- Hit!
- Watch the hair!

150
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:37,049


151
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:40,633
Ow! Thor help us!

152
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,607
Time to stop worrying
about problems out there..

153
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:44,390
 Gobber!

154
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,510
and start sorting out
the one's right here!

155
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,272
Okay, okay. I--
I'll think about it.

156
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:51,174
Hang up those saddles
 and get married.

157
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,673
- The "M" word!
- Gross!

158
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,416
- Unless it's me.
- Hah!

159
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:59,755
Start ruling like 
a proper royal couple.

160
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,711
 Marry him, please!

161
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:03,957
You're the only one with
any sense around here.

162
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,329
 With you wearing the pants, 
there's still hope.

163
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,648
- Wow!
- Gobber.

164
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,672
Not awkward at all!

165
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,312
Astrid, don't be like that.

166
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:14,692
Phew!
That's a definitive "No".

167
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:17,546
Look, if you need
 a beard to cry on,

168
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:19,572
just lean on my shoulder
and you can cry into

169
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,939
my full, thick beard.

170
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:22,518
Oh-ho-ho.

171
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,180
Thank you,Tuffnut.
Thank you..

172
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,567
- ..so much.
- Ahem.

173
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:28,792
Eret, son of Eret!

174
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,479
What's the report?

175
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:33,752
Two more trapper barges
 spotted in the strait.

176
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,280
So we go after them.

177
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:36,816
What?

178
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:40,341
One day you're gonna pick
a fight you can't win.

179
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,555
Archers!

180
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:23,267
Deathgrippers.

181
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:37,580


182
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:42,079


183
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,360


184
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:46,662
The Dragon Riders
attacked us here,

185
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,767
off the eastern strait.

186
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:50,617
Brrm...boom.

187
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:52,799
- Ragnar!
- Um, sorry.

188
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:54,905
My dear warlords.

189
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,159
How go your plans to
conquer the world.

190
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:00,184
Ha-ha!

191
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,556
Grimmel, my old friend.

192
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,425
Thank you for come---Oh!

193
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:09,501
A year since Drago's defeat.

194
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:13,486
And no further along with
your dragon army, I see.

195
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,150
You can thank the young
chief of Berk for that.

196
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,993
Stoick's boy?

197
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:21,311
Ew! He and he's peace-loving 
Dragon Riders

198
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,024
continue to raid our ships

199
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,196
and steal our dragons!

200
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:27,435
Hm.. that does sound
 like a nuisence.

201
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:31,129
But I'm in the business of killing
dragons, not retriving them.

202
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:32,779
Hah? But, Grimmel?

203
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,589
That idiot boy has done
the all of the work for you,

204
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:39,000
gathering the dragons in one place.
Why bother me?

205
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:43,437
Because the flock is
protected by a Night Fury.

206
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:49,251
- Not possible.
- Well..

207
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,145
it seems one's slipped
through your fingers.

208
00:11:52,654 --> 00:11:56,345
Look, Berk's dragons
will follow the alpha.

209
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,768
So we'll pay you
to capture him

210
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,461
and bring the flock to us.

211
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:05,367
We even have your
 favorite bait.

212
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:10,606
The only dragon they left
us from last night's raid.

213
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,618
A female?

214
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,119
Hm..

215
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,906
So, do we have a deal,

216
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,705
old friend?

217
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,277
Look out!
Look out!

218
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:35,393
When all is said and done,

219
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:39,027
this young chief will
bring me the Night Fury.

220
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:41,971
They don't have a leader,

221
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:45,002
just a boy.

222
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,681
Hiccup.

223
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,630
This is Berk, son.

224
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:57,316
It's our home.

225
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,713
It was the home of
your grand parents

226
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,845
and their grand
parents before them.

227
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,698
It's my job as chief
 to protect us, Hiccup.

228
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:08,570
And one day, when 
you're all grown-up,

229
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,476
that job will be
 past on to you.

230
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,049
- Okay.
- It's very important, son.

231
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,542
Because out there,
beyond the sunset,

232
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,887
lies the home of the dragons.

233
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,324
- Wow!
- Aye.

234
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,815
Legends tell of ships that
sailed to close to it,

235
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,627
only to drop off 
the edge of the world.

236
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,117
Never to be
 seen again.

237
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,597
But those sailor
who turned back..

238
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:37,419
.. told tales of a great waterfall.

239
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:40,867
And dragons guarding the
entrance to a hidden world.

240
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,917
Not just a nest, Hiccup,

241
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,286
but a land from which
the all dragons come.

242
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,284
Even, Night Furies?

243
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:52,586
Ha-ha.
Specialy Night Furies.

244
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,870
Oh. Those are scary.

245
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,553
Don't you worry.

246
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,987
One day I'll find the hidden world

247
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:00,879
and seal it up.

248
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,425
So that people and dragons

249
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:05,525
will fight no more.

250
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:17,693
What?

251
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,412
Oh,alright! You do know
 it's not a chew-toy, don't you?

252
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,834
Is this what you want?
Oh, do you want this leg?

253
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,818
You want my leg? Yah!

254
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:28,423
Go, get.

255
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,754
You're getting pretty good
at gliding on your own, bud.

256
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,015
Wow!

257
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,762
So this is where you come
to get away from Gobber.

258
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:01,297
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

259
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,913
Ugh!

260
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:07,906
Well, he's right, you know?

261
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:11,012
Re-- really?
You think you and I should..

262
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,643
Oh, Gods, no!

263
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,910
We're nowhere near
 ready for that.

264
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,660
You know, that's--
that's crazy.

265
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,921
I mean he's right
 about all of this.

266
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,426


267
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,361
It does seem like the whole
world knows about us now.

268
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,187
Yep. And the more dragons
we bring back here,

269
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:28,117
the bigger of a target we become.

270
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,118
Ugh!

271
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:33,248
I just wish there was some way
to make them leave us alone.

272
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,862
There might be.

273
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,783
Dad used to talk about
an old mariners myth.

274
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:43,472
Of a secret land at
the edge of the world

275
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:45,784
where dragons lived
totally out of reach.

276
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,358
Huh, well..

277
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,682
sailor are known
 for tall tales.

278
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,090
True. But what
if it's real?

279
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:55,797
It could be the answer
to all of our problems.

280
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,002
How?

281
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:59,224
By moving the dragons there?

282
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,670
Uh-uh. All of us.

283
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:03,853
Seriously?

284
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:06,739
And abandon our home
of seven generations?

285
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,267
The home your father
left you to protect.

286
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,187
Uh..

287
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:14,211
Yeah, I think we need
 a real solution, Hiccup.

288
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,352
Or we could just take Gobbers 
advice and tie the knot.

289
00:16:23,352 --> 00:16:24,998
That should fix everything.

290
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,336
But, hey, if you're having 
doubts about yours truly,

291
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,820
I'm pretty sure
 snotlout's available.

292
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,952
He only has eyes
for your mom.

293
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:35,471
Huh? Oh!

294
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,340
- Playing dirty now, hah?
- You asked for it!

295
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,886
Looks like there might
be a wedding after all.

296
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:44,331
That is a low-bloid-No.

297
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,459
No, you're not
getting away.

298
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,868
Ah! Okay, okay!
You win! You win!

299
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,867
You always win.

300
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,300
You knew what you
 were getting into.

301
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:54,672
Aa-ha? Right.

302
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,268
Uh...bud?

303
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,433
What? Yeah, sure,
don't bother to wait for us!

304
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:11,376
Uh..

305
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:04,665
Oh, my gosh!

306
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,070
Uh..Hiccup!

307
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,326
Yeah. You know, we're--
 we're friends!

308
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,104
No need to kill us.

309
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,413
- Wow!
- Another Night Fury.

310
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,012
Well, not quite. It's more like a

311
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,893
- Bright--
- A Light Fury.

312
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,868
Yeah, yours is better, probably.

313
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,499
What do you mean "gone"?
Vanished? Into thin air!

314
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,942
What do you think?

315
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,686
Uh-uh. stubbier ears.
No dorsal fins.

316
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,778
Okay. Got it. Ha-ha.
What a night.

317
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,950
What's gotten into you?

318
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,325
What is all this slobbering
 and panting?

319
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,399
Isn't it obvious?
He's in love.

320
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,121
Trust me, relationships are
nothing bur pain and misery.

321
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,610
Oh!

322
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:12,593
What did I just say?

323
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,370
A--Am I not enough?

324
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,014
I think that's a "No".

325
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,296
- Something like this?
- You know what?

326
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,091
Just trace your Toothless
card and make her white.

327
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,206
You could have
 led with that...

328
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:38,421
Can you believe it?
Toothless has a girlfriend.

329
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,385
I never took you
 for a romantic.

330
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:42,362
Like, ever.

331
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:43,988
But it's so sweet.

332
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:45,668
I mean, look!

333
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,561
Oh, okay.
That's just sad.

334
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:58,404
- And weird.
- Yeah, you better do something.

335
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:02,198
Seriously? I'd rather shovel
poop all day than watch that.

336
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:05,414
Alright.. Let's head back to the
woods and see if we can find her.

337
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:10,287
Ah. Good idea!

338
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,935
---

339
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,100
Sh! It's boy talk.

340
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:16,002
- What?
- Come on. Let's go work this out.

341
00:21:16,338 --> 00:21:18,433
So, you wanna get married?

342
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:20,447
- Uh, no, actually.
- Good news.

343
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,578
I've been to two weddings.
I crashed both, but..

344
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:25,477
..none as high-profile
 as this one.

345
00:21:25,682 --> 00:21:28,528
Lots of pressure, judgment.
 Not just by me.

346
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,703
Look, we talked about it.
We're not getting married.

347
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:33,178
Hold feet!
I've seen it before.

348
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,952
Don't worry, little Hiccy.
I'm here.

349
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,426
Wait, "Hiccy"?

350
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,176
Now, I've seen the way
 Astrid looks at you.

351
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,858
Everyone has that doubt.

352
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,669
That not-so-subtle 
disappointment.

353
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,397
That longing for something more than you.

354
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:47,797
You need to focus
 on being worthy.

355
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:50,347
I mean, she's a warrior
queen, for thor's sake.

356
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:53,167
And...you're neither.

357
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,500
But with me as your bestman,
your spirit guide if you will,

358
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,278
you'll learn to embrace
your inner viking.

359
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,867
Show these nay sayers,
of which there are many,

360
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,663
that you're more than
just a malnourished runt

361
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,680
with bad hair and
strange teeth,

362
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,140
and a twig for a neck.

363
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:10,252
You're--You're really
 bad at pep talks.

364
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,417
Stop letting these insecurities 
get the best of you.

365
00:22:13,728 --> 00:22:16,055
Everyone's  watching.
I mean, everyone.

366
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,655
You need to man-up.
Do as I do.

367
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,328
It'll be hard, but

368
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,296
you have my word.
And untill I break that word,

369
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:24,763
I won't give up.

370
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:27,177
Hey! Hey!

371
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:29,467
Am I wasting my time here?

372
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:31,078
You see some shiny
thing in the woods or--

373
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:32,599
Ooh, what is that?

374
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:44,336
Toothless!

375
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:46,626
Don't move a muscle.

376
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:49,157
Hey!

377
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,425
- Someone's here.
- Hah?

378
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,261
He managed to slip past our scouts

379
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,023
- and lay a trap in the woods.
- It ruined boy talk.

380
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:06,261
- Oh-ho.
- God, let me out and--

381
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,908
Slow down, Gobber.

382
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,568
Just get a search team on the
ground and scouts in the air.

383
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,488
Toothless and I'll
 fly the coastline.

384
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:16,134
Yeah, I wouldn't advice taking
Toothless anywhere, chief.

385
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,230
I know this handywork.

386
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:21,550
Grimmel the grisly.
Famous back where I'm from.

387
00:23:21,575 --> 00:23:23,951
The smartest dragon
hunter I ever met.

388
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:26,354
Well, next to me
 of course.

389
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:29,018
He can't be that smart.
He left his trap unmanned.

390
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:30,018
Ha-ha.

391
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:33,198
Nothing's accidental when
it comes to old Grimmel.

392
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:35,536
He lives for the hunt,

393
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:39,293
to get inside the mind of his
prey, to control it's every choice.

394
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,665
It's all a game to him.

395
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,616
Well, he doesn't know
who he's playing with.

396
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:45,680
Yeah, and we've dealt
with his kind before.

397
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,667
Don't underestimate him, Hiccup.

398
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,873
Mark my words.
He'' be back.

399
00:23:50,656 --> 00:23:52,177
Then we'll be waiting for him.

400
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,246
Alright,alright. Come on
give me a clue here.

401
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:11,489
Give me a clue, dad.

402
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:36,609
Well' I hope you don't mind
if I help, my friend.

403
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,959
This is a--
Ooh, quite good.

404
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:44,922
That's aggresive,but let me
finish my drink.

405
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:50,457
Toothless!

406
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,516
What did you do to him?

407
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,331
Mhm.. nothing that
 he wouldn't sleep of.

408
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:00,937
Yep. Ah.

409
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:02,898
Ha-ha.
May I?

410
00:25:03,431 --> 00:25:05,059
Chief Huccup. Hm?

411
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:06,748
Do I say chief Hic-cup?

412
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,341
Or do I just call you Hiccup?

413
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:09,904
What do you prefer?

414
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,494
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

415
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:17,740
No? Ha-ha.

416
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,844
Well, your father knew of me. Now..

417
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,022
there was a chief.

418
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:26,514
One of the greatest dragon
 hunters to have ever lived.

419
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:30,160
What would 
he think of you?

420
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:32,543
Oh-ho-ho.
Ha-ha.

421
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,911
Huh.

422
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:37,469
He had it right, you know? Making
 it his mission to distroy the beasts

423
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,779
so that you could grow up
in a better world.

424
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,831
He changed his mind.

425
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,328
And look where that got him.

426
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,657
So, let's skip to the point.

427
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,071
I am the Night Fury killer.

428
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,852
I've hunted every
last one but yours.

429
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:58,170
You're going to
give me that dragon.

430
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:00,108
- Or I will--
- I'll never give him up.

431
00:26:00,302 --> 00:26:02,172
Ha-ha-ha!

432
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:05,365
You wish dragons to live free.

433
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,379
Among us, like equals.

434
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:11,253
A toxic notion, my boy.

435
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,852
History has shown that 
we are the supirior species.

436
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:18,911
What if word of your misguided
ideas were to spread?

437
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,859
I would be the undoing of civilization

438
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,308
as we...

439
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:25,899
..know it.

440
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,824
Hm..

441
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:33,845
Did we get him?

442
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,028
Oh!

443
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:37,840
Now!

444
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:41,201
Sorry to barge in.

445
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,772
You think you can come into my home

446
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:46,284
sit in father's chair

447
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:48,149
and threaten my dragon?

448
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:50,205
This is Berk.

449
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:52,192
And we've defended
our way of life

450
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,044
from far worse than you.

451
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:55,541
Ooh. Ha-ha.

452
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,417
A fighting spirit.

453
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,248
I love it! Only..

454
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:01,346
I'm afraid 
you're mistaken.

455
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,660
You've never seen
anything like me.

456
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,859
Astrid, look out!

457
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,067
Hah?

458
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,062
Ha-ha.

459
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,015
Look out!

460
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:25,733
Son, get clear!

461
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:28,598


462
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:34,073


463
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:40,231
Have my dragon
ready when I return.

464
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:43,731
Or I will destroy
everything you love.

465
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:59,563
---

466
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:00,824
---

467
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:03,459
Alright! Alright, everybody,
settle down, please!

468
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:04,981


469
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,024
- Fishlegs..
- Hm?

470
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:09,581
Have you ever seen that
species of dragon before?

471
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:14,997
- Let me at 'em!
- I'll give him a piece of my mind.

472
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,333
And by mind, I mean fist!

473
00:28:18,172 --> 00:28:20,521
Did you miss the part
where we almost died?

474
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,532
Have you seen my house?

475
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,685
This is a new kind of enemy.

476
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:28,586
And I underestimated him.
Now, that's on me.

477
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,482
But I will not do that again.

478
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:33,438
We're vikings.
We don't run from a fight.

479
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:35,559
At least, I don't.

480
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:37,364
- You might.
- I agree with Hiccup.

481
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:39,244
We haven't seen the last of Grimmel.

482
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:42,483
He' s a predator,
 single minded and patient.

483
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,672
He won't stop untill
he gets what he wants.

484
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:45,959
I'm with Eret.

485
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:48,552
We have to take
 this threat seriously.

486
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,814
Grimmel is just
a sign of the times.

487
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,141
Our enemies are getting smarter,

488
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,338
more determined.

489
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:56,007
We're not just over crowded.

490
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:58,036
We're exposed and vulnereble.

491
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,606
Short of full blown war

492
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:02,355
and risking everyone we love.

493
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,860
I don't--

494
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,295
I don't see a way

495
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,152
of staying here
any longer.

496
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,678
Get to the point!

497
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:11,772
Hey!

498
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,608
Here him out!

499
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,475
If we want to live in peace

500
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:24,288
with our dragons,
 we need a better plan.

501
00:29:24,403 --> 00:29:26,655
So, what are you saying?

502
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,417
I'm saying,
 we have to dissapear.

503
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:31,268
Off the map.

504
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:34,724
Take the dragons to a place
where no one will find them.

505
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,697
And where might that be?

506
00:29:36,722 --> 00:29:38,400
He's talking about a quest

507
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,445
- for the Hidden World.
- The hidden, what?

508
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:42,682
-Out to lunch.
- Ha-ha!

509
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:45,360
My father was obssesed
with it when I was a boy.

510
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,847
He made notes and maps in
search of the ancestral home

511
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,766
of all dragons..

512
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,416
tucked away somewhere beyond
the egde of the world.

513
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:56,425
It maybe the solution we need.

514
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:59,078
We're dragon people.

515
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:00,814
It's where we belong.

516
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:01,729


517
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:03,553
Look, I know this is our home.

518
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,673
My father left me to protect it.

519
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:11,214
But Berk is more than this place.

520
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:13,449
We're Berk!

521
00:30:13,474 --> 00:30:15,260
The people! 
The dragons!

522
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:18,015
I say Berk is
where ever we go.

523
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:22,888
I'm with him!
Who else?

524
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,898
Excuse me. 
Coming through.

525
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:46,774
I'm just get 
my food here.

526
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,359
Fishmeat, eat your rocks.
 Eat your rocks.

527
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:53,593
Gods! People who fly with
 babies are the worst!

528
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:58,040
I feel like I'm always asking
you this question, but...s

529
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,847
Whoa!

530
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,289
Is there an actual plan or..?

531
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:05,184
Just keep flying untill we
reach the end of the world.

532
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,411
Dah! Seems sensible.

533
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:09,835
So..

534
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,546
- where are they?
- Gone.

535
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:14,910
- Obviously.
- The Night Fury escaped you?

536
00:31:15,046 --> 00:31:17,022
- Again?
- I encouraged it.

537
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,346
They've abandoned there
only defensible position.

538
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:23,839
Running scared with what
 little they can carry.

539
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:26,061
Ugh!  It just keeps going.

540
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,136
That's 'cause the
world's actually round.

541
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,957
Sun's round.
Moon's round.

542
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:31,992
Stars are round.

543
00:31:32,117 --> 00:31:34,134
Even though they're
 small and stupid.

544
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,359
- Ha-ha.
- Right stars.

545
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,971
Don't, Fret.
They won't get far.

546
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:41,236
The Night Fury is distracted.

547
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:45,070
I introduced him
 to your female.

548
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:48,132
Furies mate for life, you see.

549
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,467
What you picking up on, bud?

550
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:55,671
- The Light Fury!
- She is following us!

551
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:57,270
Wow!

552
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:03,109
Where did she go?
Is she made of sky?

553
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,934
Whoa!
Hold on, Toothless!

554
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,736
Well, look who it is.

555
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,154
Aha!
Ah!

556
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:20,133
Oh, hey, it's really
nice to finally---

557
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:20,839
Aaah!

558
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Whoa!

559
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:35,606
- So great!
- Not a word.

560
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,187
Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.
But where did they go?

561
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:43,309
It explains.

562
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,839
Night Furies can't survive in the cold,
so they havn't gone north.

563
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:49,344
They're trying to put
distance between themselves

564
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:51,206
and enemies to the
east and south.

565
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:56,194
And Night Furies cannot fly
long distanses without rest.

566
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,033
Their flight path
must include stops.

567
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,494
Potty break!

568
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:06,085
Therefore, they have gone..

569
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,707
They can can only had gone...

570
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,749
Does anyone want
 to take a guess?

571
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,563
Anyone?

572
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:19,638
W-- W--W--

573
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,780
Ah! East!

574
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:23,666
West!

575
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:26,058
- Hah?
- Simple, you see?

576
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:28,361
Oh-ho, isn't this fun?

577
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:29,825
Yes?

578
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:31,720
- No?
- Ugh!

579
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,297
Yes! Yes!

580
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,213
Where is your love of the hunt?

581
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:39,228
I thought you
 were conquerors!

582
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,592
You'll have your prize, in time.

583
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:44,037
Just allow me a few more days

584
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:45,924
to enjoy these.

585
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:49,318
I have dearly missed it.

586
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:50,662
Alright.

587
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,337
Looks like we're
 camping here for tonight.

588
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:54,713
Well, thanks thor for that.

589
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:56,516
Yes! my own place!

590
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:58,181
I plan to build a hut.

591
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,906
Only for the bearded.

592
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:01,705
Ruffnut, you've
got to stay out.

593
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,568
Chins whiskers don't count.

594
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:06,547
I see a tower of manliness
 in the shape of me.

595
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:08,619
It's gonna be taller than Eret

596
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,229
with bigger muscles.

597
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,468
Wha--What?

598
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:13,178
Get out of my house!

599
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,098
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah! There's a problem.

600
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,388
Ever since you showed up
you've been trying to upstage me.

601
00:34:18,413 --> 00:34:20,686
You're just so... 
 Jealous! Delusional!

602
00:34:20,711 --> 00:34:22,673
Yeah, delusion is
 a good word for it.

603
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:24,068
Listen, son of Eret,

604
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,461
When Hiccup blows it 
as chief, I'm next in line.

605
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,000
Number two. 'cause
 I'm clealy Volka's favorite.

606
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:31,505
So, better start show
 me some respect!

607
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:34,568
Strange little man.

608
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:37,138
Ah, don't mind him.
It's not your fault

609
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:39,469
you have the body
 of a norse God.

610
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,892
I myself have
the same problem.

611
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,108
Ahh!

612
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:43,861
Uh..

613
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:45,128


614
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:47,405
Blacksmith's stall
 goes right here.

615
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:49,287
Ah! One.

616
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,303
Two. Three, four, five.

617
00:34:51,794 --> 00:34:53,351
What? Oh, oh, okay.

618
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,449
Uh, hold on, gang.
I said..

619
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:57,069
- ..made a camp.
- Did you see them?

620
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,224
Not build a new village.

621
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:00,971
Who died and 
made you chief?

622
00:35:02,153 --> 00:35:03,453
What?
Ow!

623
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:06,043
 Granted this place
 is very nice,

624
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:08,189
but it's not the hidden world.

625
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:11,322
We don't even know if
this hidden world exists.

626
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:13,201
Yeah.
This place is real.

627
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,367
Yeah, there's nothing
more stubborn than

628
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:18,855
a mob of tired
hungry vikings.

629
00:35:18,982 --> 00:35:20,070
Ah! Well..

630
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:22,514
I guess this can work as
a base in the meantime.

631
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,425
It's defensible.

632
00:35:24,645 --> 00:35:25,748
Hidden.

633
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:28,167
Alright! You could stay.

634
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:29,924
Say hello to new Berk!

635
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:31,521
- Yeah!
- Let's get building, lads!

636
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,257
Untill toothless and I
find the hidden world.

637
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:35,985
Ah!

638
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:38,655
Now about that voice.

639
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,818
Can we lose the whole 
honking goose... thing?

640
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:45,515
It's hard to imagine wedded bliss 
with that going off every minute.

641
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:46,720
Ha-ha.

642
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,668
If you're going to continue west,

643
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:51,128
I should head back to make
sure we weren't followed.

644
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,762
Great idea!
I'll go with you.

645
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:54,298
- For protection.
- No!

646
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,351
You're far too important here.

647
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,504
Yeah.

648
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,321
Just...be careful.

649
00:36:03,348 --> 00:36:04,348
What?

650
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:06,503
This plan..to..

651
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,952
hide us from
the rest of the world.

652
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:10,743
Though--though
 I wish it were possible,

653
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:13,291
I fear it can't last, Hiccup.

654
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:15,953
I mean, you know I tried
 to do the same for years.

655
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,626
But greedy humans

656
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,914
 always find a way.

657
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,716
I just..

658
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,729
I only ask that
you think about it.

659
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:31,532
Do you still think
I'm crazy, or..?

660
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:35,965
Let's just say this
whole idea is very, you.

661
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:37,132
Well,

662
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:39,637
thanks for supporting me last night.
It meant a lot.

663
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:40,831
Hah.

664
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,333
Don't thank me yet.

665
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,212
I just hope you're
 right about this.

666
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,839
Toothless,no.
It's too early.

667
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:38,639
Oh, now you can draw.

668
00:43:59,676 --> 00:44:01,572
Oh, someone hasn't slept.

669
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,848
Yeah,well,that Light Fury won't
let me within a mile of her.

670
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:07,110
And niether of us will be
 getting any sleep

671
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:09,592
or finding the hidden world
untill Toothless takes over.

672
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:11,049
Hey!

673
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,855
What do you think of that?

674
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,173
Yeah.

675
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:17,823
You tried this once before.
He didn't want it.

676
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:21,263
Yeah. Well, untill now he
didn't have a reason to.

677
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,687
Right, bud?

678
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,829
Hmh.

679
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:33,312
-What?
- No. Nothing. I'm--

680
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,061
I'm impressed.
I mean,look at you.

681
00:44:36,364 --> 00:44:39,404
Embracing change.
I am proud of you.

682
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,447
Well, he's my best bud.

683
00:44:41,857 --> 00:44:44,086
I want him to be happy.

684
00:44:44,111 --> 00:44:46,027
And besides it's just
until he brings her back.

685
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:52,501
- Alright!
- Ah?

686
00:44:52,772 --> 00:44:54,437
- Fire when ready.
- Oh!

687
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:03,453
Well, I guess you know
the tail is fire-proof.

688
00:45:04,143 --> 00:45:05,788
Okay, Toothless.

689
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:08,180
Okay, wait.
Yes, I know.

690
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,511
I know.
Sh! Sh!

691
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:11,214
Okay, I know.

692
00:45:12,155 --> 00:45:14,521
- Please. This is not helping.
- Well,well,well.

693
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:16,399
Someone's excited.

694
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:18,579
- Nice.
- He's fresh off his first date.

695
00:45:19,022 --> 00:45:20,420
Now he's love crazed.

696
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,573
Only we're
the one's going crazy.

697
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:25,563
The sooner he brings back
that Light Fury the better.

698
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:28,251
Yeah, but to do that,
he'll need to fly without me.

699
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:31,122
So time to give this new
and improved baby a shot.

700
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:36,011
Attaboy!
Looking sharp, Toothless!

701
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,847
Well, what do you think, bud?

702
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,587
Bring her home,
' by sundown at the latest'.

703
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,357
Yak! now, save it
 for your girlfriend!

704
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:48,097
Go on!
Get out of here.

705
00:45:56,376 --> 00:45:57,821
It's okay.

706
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:25,415
Ahem.

707
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:35,833
What?

708
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,220


709
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:56,935
Watch out!

710
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:02,420
Go Cloudjumper!

711
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:09,113


712
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:16,821
- To the chief!
- Woo-hoo!

713
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:18,336
- To the chief!
- To the chief!

714
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:19,996
To the chief.

715
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:22,061


716
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:25,217
Yeah, okay, guys!
Now, I'm just getting sick.

717
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:27,231
Okay.
Ha-ha-ha.

718
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:30,731
I've gotta say, I thought you
 were well off your rocker

719
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:32,826
but this spot 
ain't half bad.

720
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:35,190
This was supposed to be
a temporary solution.

721
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,849
It's unanimous.

722
00:50:36,874 --> 00:50:39,420
Everyone agrees we've
 definitely traded up.

723
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,505
- Well done, chief!
- Ha-ha.

724
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:43,086
What if the tail broken?

725
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,961
What if Grimmel found him?

726
00:50:44,986 --> 00:50:46,594
What if he needs me?

727
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:50,093
Would you relax?He's probably
 having the time of his life.

728
00:50:50,225 --> 00:50:52,024
How would I know?
She never comes around.

729
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:54,923
And when she does,
she's always rushing off.

730
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,308
I saying, how--how do we
know if she's right for us?

731
00:50:58,587 --> 00:51:00,381
- "Us"?
- You know, what I mean.

732
00:51:00,406 --> 00:51:02,530
She's so wild and skiddish.

733
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,674
I'm just gonna say it,
I don't trust her.

734
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:07,366
- Hah-ha!
- Can't tame 'em all, Hiccup.

735
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:10,011
Oneday you'll have to
 snap apron strings

736
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:12,133
and let Toothless
strech his wings.

737
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,635
Reminds me of a talk
I had with Stoick about you.

738
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:17,263
Gah!

739
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,115
Where do they
 keep coming from?

740
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:21,816
- Who?
- Those bloody hobgobblers.

741
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:24,553
I swear, they're popping
up faster than rabbits.

742
00:51:24,939 --> 00:51:26,746
I think they
want to eat me.

743
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,941
Evidence would
suggest that tasty.

744
00:51:29,106 --> 00:51:30,601
Hiccy, a moment?

745
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,799
Listen, I've been watching you walk.

746
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,768
Lose the limp. 
No one's gonna marry that.

747
00:51:35,998 --> 00:51:38,054
- I have a prosthetic leg.
- So am I.

748
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,598
And I have parasitic twin, but you 
don't see me limping around about it!

749
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,190
Come on.
Chin up, Hiccy.

750
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,812
Pop out that chest!
Move that butt to the--

751
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,787
Ooh!

752
00:51:55,536 --> 00:51:57,629
Mom, are you hurt?

753
00:51:57,654 --> 00:51:59,566
- What happened out there?
- I don't know how, but..

754
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:01,106
Grimmel is tracking us.

755
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:01,892
Gah!

756
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,623
That's all because
of the hobgobblers.

757
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,829
He has a hundred ships,
maybe more.

758
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,692
With enough cages for
all of our dragons.

759
00:52:11,424 --> 00:52:13,072
If Grimmel's leading them here..

760
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:15,068
..we have to take 
him out of the mix.

761
00:52:15,275 --> 00:52:17,560
Ah..and how would
 we do that?

762
00:52:17,908 --> 00:52:19,525
By going there to
 capture him.

763
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,300
Capture him?

764
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:23,954
I'm with him!
Who else?

765
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:13,206
Okay, split up.
We'll be hard to catch.

766
00:53:14,513 --> 00:53:16,913
I was thinking we should split
up, just because..

767
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,554
I like your instincts.

768
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,868
What is this?

769
00:53:31,525 --> 00:53:32,525
Oh!

770
00:54:02,093 --> 00:54:03,321
Quiet!

771
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,187
Where's your dragon
when you need him? Hm..

772
00:54:06,345 --> 00:54:07,502
chief?

773
00:54:07,598 --> 00:54:09,771
He must've forgotten
 all about you?

774
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:12,832
First rule of the hunt,

775
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:15,263
separate the prey
 from it's pack.

776
00:54:15,632 --> 00:54:19,048
You've just removed yourselves
 from the equation.

777
00:54:19,186 --> 00:54:20,713
Why are you doing this?

778
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:23,154
Really? I didn't
think you cared.

779
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:25,723
Well, unlike you,

780
00:54:25,748 --> 00:54:28,410
when I was a boy and I
came up on a Night Fury

781
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,549
I killed it where
 it slipped.

782
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:34,913
That simple act of courage
made me a hero in my village,

783
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:38,680
so I decided to
 kill every last one.

784
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:42,163
Bringing real peace to
the people of this world,

785
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:44,396
untill you came along,

786
00:54:44,605 --> 00:54:47,296
preaching that dragons
are something other than

787
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:49,620
thieves and murderers.

788
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:50,886
Pfuf!

789
00:54:51,233 --> 00:54:53,385
That nonsense dies now,

790
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:54,690
starting with you.

791
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:56,230
But you have dragons
 of your own.

792
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,446
Ha-ha. Please.

793
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,842
They're dragon killers,

794
00:55:01,154 --> 00:55:03,841
drugged into obedience
with their own venom.

795
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:07,442
Not even your precious
alpha could control them.

796
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:10,832
They serve me.
And only me.

797
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:12,756
Allow me to demonstrate.

798
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:14,851
Take cover!

799
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:21,163
Split!

800
00:55:21,328 --> 00:55:22,328
Whoa!

801
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:36,728
Ah!

802
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:38,204
Hey!

803
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:50,112
Up here!

804
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:53,190
What?

805
00:55:58,618 --> 00:55:59,944
Oh! Ah!

806
00:56:05,859 --> 00:56:07,216
Hurry!

807
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:14,598
Hiccup!

808
00:56:20,184 --> 00:56:22,462
- Ah! Got ya!
- Go, Cloudjumper!

809
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:32,281
Over here!

810
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:45,193
Hm.

811
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:47,815
Ugh! he takes that
stupid baby everywhere.

812
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,075
Thor almighty!

813
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,222
Guess we won't be 
needing this then, hah?

814
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,366
I led us right into his trap.

815
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,002
Yeah.
Nice work, chief.

816
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,574
Right,Ruff?

817
00:57:02,979 --> 00:57:03,986
Wait.

818
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:05,633
- Uh?
- Where is Ruffnut?

819
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,202
We-- We left her behind?

820
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:09,331
How could you not
noticed she was missing?

821
00:57:09,356 --> 00:57:10,963
You ride a two-headed dragon!

822
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,260
Oh, yeah.

823
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,744
---

824
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:17,358
Dumb!

825
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:19,504
This just gets
better and better.

826
00:57:19,964 --> 00:57:22,508
-We moved, but..
- I tried to avoid looking at her--

827
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:23,850
---

828
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,994
O- Okay. Guys, just keep
 your helmets on.

829
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:29,479
- Toothless and I will find--
- Toothless has the Light Fury now.

830
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:31,753
He's probably not even coming back.

831
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:34,353
- What?
- You gave him his freedom, Hiccup.

832
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,985
What were you expecting?

833
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,835
I never thought he'd
 stay away for good!

834
00:57:38,285 --> 00:57:39,813
I've--I-- Oh.

835
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:43,609
Look, I'll-- I'll figure it out.
I just need more time.

836
00:57:46,265 --> 00:57:48,323
He thinks he has
 to lead alone.

837
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,509
Well, because his father had to.

838
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,854
He doesn't realize the 
strenth we have together.

839
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:57,944
Do you still believe in him?

840
00:57:58,098 --> 00:57:59,104
Of course!

841
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:01,007
I wish he did.

842
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,041
But he thinks he's nothing
 without Toothless.

843
00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:07,872
Then help him
 realize the truth.

844
00:58:13,134 --> 00:58:14,268
- Get on!
- What?

845
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:15,559
We're going to find him.

846
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,368
Really?

847
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:20,766
Everybody stay put.

848
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,664
We will get Ruffnut back.

849
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:23,924
Don't worry.

850
00:58:23,949 --> 00:58:25,077
Hah. Worry?

851
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:26,658
If they're stuck with Ruffnut,

852
00:58:26,658 --> 00:58:28,112
I'm more worried about them.

853
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,137
Ha-ha.

854
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:32,535
Why the long face? Huh.

855
00:58:33,265 --> 00:58:35,619
I mean, mine's long,
but yours is really long.

856
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:38,310
All face and no brain,like
you've got it streched it at birth.

857
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:39,766
Do you have twin, too?

858
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:41,775
Tuffnut took up all the
room in mom's belly,

859
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,876
otherwise I'd have a rounder
 head and more brains.

860
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:45,548
- That's science.
- God!

861
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,289
My braids are like little
Zippleback, see?

862
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:50,093


863
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:52,795
Even the mole spots looks
like eyes, it's so cute.

864
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,435
They even have little horns and
everything, just like barf and belch,

865
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,059
except me and barf
can't stand out.

866
00:58:57,084 --> 00:58:59,368
So they're really just barfs.
It's warm in here.

867
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,622
I know what
you're thinking.

868
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,137
You've never had
a prisoner this hot.

869
00:59:05,144 --> 00:59:06,794
All the boys love me,
except Eret

870
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:08,283
who totally lost his chance.

871
00:59:08,308 --> 00:59:10,704
That ship has sailed
,boys. Sorry!

872
00:59:10,754 --> 00:59:13,671
And Hiccup's practically married
to that round-head Astrid.

873
00:59:13,747 --> 00:59:16,832
But snotlout and fishleg's there.
They're basically at my hand

874
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,770
Now, I just have
 to choose, you know.

875
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:21,352
Snotlout is a beefcake but
almost ---, you know.

876
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,952
Sometimes I think he's more
in love with himself than me.

877
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,620
There's only room for one
beauty in this relationship.

878
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:28,968
Huh. Fishleg would 
keep me alive long..

879
00:59:28,993 --> 00:59:31,726
if I had to eat one of them strainer
 than some glacier somewhere.

880
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:33,225
But he never shuts up about dragons.

881
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,955
So do you hate 'em when
people never stops talking?

882
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,836
Yes, I-do!

883
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:38,886
Blah-Blah.
It's so boring.

884
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:40,902
Can't we just feed her
 to your dragons?

885
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,188
Hey, what do you have
to eat around here?

886
00:59:42,213 --> 00:59:43,735
I'm allergic to fish,
you should know that.

887
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,260
That's all they have at
that stupid new island.

888
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:48,554
Do you have any clams?

889
00:59:48,579 --> 00:59:50,243
They're like little mouse
with slightly food inside

890
00:59:50,268 --> 00:59:52,452
that's already chewed like
the way mom used to do it..

891
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:54,237
Enough!

892
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:58,073
untill I turned 12,and she was
 like " Chew your own food!"

893
00:59:58,098 --> 00:59:59,670
and I was like
 " No, I don't like it".

894
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:02,328
Most annoying creature
ever to cross my path.

895
01:00:02,353 --> 01:00:03,837
Hah? Aw..

896
01:00:11,892 --> 01:00:14,239
Take him and go!
Please!

897
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,801
I beg you!

898
01:00:16,115 --> 01:00:18,600
The deathgrippers will
have to forgot dinner.

899
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:20,693
Ew! You feed your dragons..

900
01:00:20,905 --> 01:00:22,184
..dragons?

901
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:22,956
Go!

902
01:00:22,981 --> 01:00:25,016
Where's your bathroom? I gotta..

903
01:00:25,652 --> 01:00:27,085
Okay! Gods!

904
01:00:27,161 --> 01:00:28,731
No wonder you have grey hair.

905
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:32,165
Stress is not good for you.

906
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,190
Ha-ha!

907
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,427
Ha-ha!
So long , losers!

908
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:48,852
- Where is she heading?
- She's tracking something.

909
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:50,188
Aren't you ,girl?

910
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:53,358
There's nothing but
miles and miles of--

911
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,457
- A waterfall.
- At the end of the world.

912
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,872
- Woo-hoo!
- Stop it!

913
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:30,838
Ha-ha.

914
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:25,185
Hah?

915
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,432
It really does exist.

916
01:04:09,503 --> 01:04:10,840
- Just--
- Sh! Sh!

917
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,994
You'll spook them.

918
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:56,677
Now, that's a king.

919
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:40,844
We should go.

920
01:05:41,678 --> 01:05:43,029
Oh, no!

921
01:05:54,064 --> 01:05:55,375
Stormfly!

922
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:57,690


923
01:06:12,646 --> 01:06:14,075
Go! Go!

924
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:28,119
You know, I'm sorry, but I --I--

925
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:52,592
Hah?

926
01:06:53,073 --> 01:06:54,301
Son..

927
01:06:56,048 --> 01:06:58,004
You should be at sleep.

928
01:06:58,098 --> 01:06:59,590
I was thirsty.

929
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:04,895
Come here.

930
01:07:09,587 --> 01:07:10,553
Alright.

931
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,110
Dad?

932
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,110
are... you gonna
get us a new mom?

933
01:07:25,185 --> 01:07:26,735
I don't want another.

934
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,247
Your mom...

935
01:07:28,538 --> 01:07:30,149
..was the only
woman for me.

936
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,819
She was the love of my life.

937
01:07:35,572 --> 01:07:36,972
But with love

938
01:07:36,997 --> 01:07:38,708
comes loss, son.

939
01:07:39,976 --> 01:07:41,480
It's part of the deal.

940
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:43,921
Sometimes it hurts,
 but in the end

941
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:46,795
it's all worth it.

942
01:07:49,339 --> 01:07:51,058
There's  no greater gift

943
01:07:51,107 --> 01:07:52,404
than love.

944
01:07:53,007 --> 01:07:54,054
Hm..

945
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:36,308
It's okay, bud.

946
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:39,405
You belong there, with her.

947
01:08:41,548 --> 01:08:42,925
We don't.

948
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:47,443
And that's all great.

949
01:08:48,445 --> 01:08:50,812
We'll find a way to--

950
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:01,170
Hey!

951
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,166
Ha-ha!

952
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,833
She followed us back!

953
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,684
We might not have to
say good-bye after all.

954
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:21,652
That's it.

955
01:09:21,812 --> 01:09:23,813
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

956
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:25,707
- Ruffnut?
- Miss me?

957
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:27,274
How did you escape?

958
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:28,979
I annoyed them till
they let me go.

959
01:09:29,004 --> 01:09:30,557
Wait. Wait.

960
01:09:30,651 --> 01:09:32,260
Grimmel let you go?

961
01:09:32,285 --> 01:09:33,569
So dumb. Huh.

962
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,529
They couldn't handle me.

963
01:09:35,737 --> 01:09:37,743
See, everyone thinks
Tuffnut's more annoying, but

964
01:09:37,768 --> 01:09:38,859
- Look. Hold on.
- Ruffnut?

965
01:09:38,945 --> 01:09:41,208
Focus. Were you followed?

966
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,734
I never look back, Hiccup.

967
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:46,679
Toothless!

968
01:09:48,043 --> 01:09:49,216
Toothless?

969
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:55,520


970
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:01,452
Toothless! Come back!

971
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,068
No!

972
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:31,718
And now, our little game
must come to an end.

973
01:10:37,059 --> 01:10:38,574
Hold 'em off, alpha.

974
01:10:39,044 --> 01:10:41,803
No reason for
her to die, too.

975
01:10:55,574 --> 01:10:57,869
What are you doing?
We could totally take him.

976
01:10:57,894 --> 01:10:59,514
Not with her life
 on the line.

977
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:04,556
Save your breath!

978
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:07,836
The only  alpha they
 respond to is me.

979
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:15,932
Oh, don't feel too badly.

980
01:11:16,316 --> 01:11:17,846
You've tried your best!

981
01:11:18,221 --> 01:11:20,645
But you're nothing

982
01:11:20,758 --> 01:11:22,361
without your dragon!

983
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:39,454
Toothless!

984
01:11:56,903 --> 01:11:59,310
Well, that's just..urg..great.

985
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:00,809
Now what?

986
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:02,354
I think it's time for number two

987
01:12:02,697 --> 01:12:03,973
to become number one.

988
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:05,782
He'll listen to you.

989
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,030
- Don't say it.
- I wasn't going to.

990
01:12:13,219 --> 01:12:14,991
I shouldn't have dragged
you out there.

991
01:12:15,016 --> 01:12:16,470
He wouldn't have
 flown me back.

992
01:12:16,495 --> 01:12:18,101
- She wouldn't have followed.
- Yep.

993
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:19,138
Ugh!

994
01:12:19,352 --> 01:12:22,152
I feel like the same screw up
I was before I met Toothless.

995
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:23,604
I can see that.

996
01:12:24,087 --> 01:12:26,198
Are you just gonna stand there
and agree with everything?

997
01:12:26,223 --> 01:12:27,662
Well, you're right.

998
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:29,518
You're back to
where you started.

999
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:31,895
But I was the first
 to believe in you.

1000
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:35,797
And I have watched you doubt 
whether you're worthy ever since.

1001
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:37,634
But you know what?

1002
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:40,125
I am the person I am today

1003
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,881
because of you.

1004
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:44,594
I've never told you that,
but it's true.

1005
01:12:45,413 --> 01:12:47,875
You're the bravest,
most stubborn

1006
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,840
most determined
knuckle-head I know.

1007
01:12:51,938 --> 01:12:53,938
Toothless didn't give
 you that, Hiccup.

1008
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:56,717
- He just made it..
- Easier?

1009
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,262
And now. it's gonna
 be a lot harder.

1010
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:03,783
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

1011
01:13:05,703 --> 01:13:07,275
Probably something stupid.

1012
01:13:08,252 --> 01:13:09,798
That's the Hiccup I know.

1013
01:13:13,027 --> 01:13:14,238
Suit up, gang.

1014
01:13:14,728 --> 01:13:16,154
We're going to get them back.

1015
01:13:16,507 --> 01:13:17,514
What?

1016
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:18,974
He's lost his mind.

1017
01:13:19,053 --> 01:13:22,028
Now, that's marriage material.

1018
01:13:22,205 --> 01:13:24,350
At last,---

1019
01:13:24,492 --> 01:13:26,379
- You're ready.
- Um..

1020
01:13:27,047 --> 01:13:28,798
How are we gonna get
our dragons back?

1021
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:30,734
Without dragons?

1022
01:13:30,759 --> 01:13:31,964
Trust me.

1023
01:13:36,004 --> 01:13:37,004
Get inside!

1024
01:13:37,074 --> 01:13:38,612
You heard that?

1025
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:41,243
Move!

1026
01:13:43,498 --> 01:13:46,082
Um.. that's right, alpha

1027
01:13:46,151 --> 01:13:48,123
no suprises.

1028
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:53,481
Oh!

1029
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,044
So..

1030
01:13:58,263 --> 01:14:00,201
..jump off the cliff?

1031
01:14:00,714 --> 01:14:02,139
In these?

1032
01:14:02,164 --> 01:14:03,586
That's the best you've got?

1033
01:14:03,683 --> 01:14:06,309
No, you guys are
the best I've got.

1034
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,233
Oh! Aw..

1035
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:10,180
I'm with him!
Who else?

1036
01:14:10,442 --> 01:14:12,613
Ruffnut, that was my line.

1037
01:14:12,638 --> 01:14:14,617
Let's go!

1038
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:20,280
- Woo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1039
01:14:20,305 --> 01:14:22,361
Hell, yeah!

1040
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:23,935
Up!

1041
01:14:28,647 --> 01:14:30,068
Down again!

1042
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,772
Aw..Ha-ha.

1043
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:38,421
You didn't think I'd actually
hand you the Night Fury, did you?

1044
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:41,210
- He's mine to kill!
- That snake!

1045
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,407
I intend to finish
 what I've started.

1046
01:14:44,946 --> 01:14:46,815
Best of luck controlling them

1047
01:14:47,078 --> 01:14:48,830
without an alpha.

1048
01:14:48,855 --> 01:14:50,423
Hold on, Toothless!

1049
01:14:54,817 --> 01:14:57,542
Ah!

1050
01:14:57,567 --> 01:15:00,451
Could've use

1051
01:15:05,364 --> 01:15:06,624
Ha!

1052
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:13,247
Tooth!

1053
01:15:14,434 --> 01:15:15,435
Run!

1054
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:20,530


1055
01:15:33,813 --> 01:15:35,086
Perfect timing!

1056
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:39,618
Game faces!

1057
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:41,942
What are you looking for?
Get in there!

1058
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,691
Uh.

1059
01:15:44,447 --> 01:15:45,453


1060
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,807


1061
01:15:53,245 --> 01:15:54,778
Oh..

1062
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,559
Ha-ha.

1063
01:15:57,977 --> 01:15:59,299
Ah!

1064
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,095
Yah!

1065
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:06,404
Hah.

1066
01:16:07,382 --> 01:16:08,388
Oh!

1067
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:15,883


1068
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:17,911


1069
01:16:18,136 --> 01:16:19,727


1070
01:16:25,139 --> 01:16:26,322
Head's up!

1071
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:27,933
- Ah!
- Thanks!

1072
01:16:28,052 --> 01:16:29,278
Look out! Yah!

1073
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,785
Oh!

1074
01:16:31,912 --> 01:16:32,919
Thanks.

1075
01:16:36,285 --> 01:16:37,713
Here!

1076
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:42,569
Run!

1077
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,147
Yah!

1078
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:53,692
Yah!

1079
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:01,153
I'm coming, Toothless!

1080
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:04,093
You still think he
 cares about you?

1081
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:09,766
Let's just see
who he follows.

1082
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,351
I'm sorry, bud.
For everything.

1083
01:17:43,195 --> 01:17:44,663
Now, let's go
and get her!

1084
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,457
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

1085
01:17:50,981 --> 01:17:53,546
- Number 2, coming through!
- Suprise!

1086
01:17:53,824 --> 01:17:56,078
I'm sorry about that.

1087
01:17:56,134 --> 01:17:57,958
Yah!

1088
01:17:59,486 --> 01:18:01,439
One more free.
Four to go.

1089
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:04,204
- Hah.
- Ah!

1090
01:18:04,602 --> 01:18:06,420
Thank you, buck.

1091
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:07,727
I got your backs!

1092
01:18:07,752 --> 01:18:10,641
Ah!

1093
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,032
Yeah, it's almost
 like we're a team.

1094
01:18:15,974 --> 01:18:19,632
Oh, you've brought
a baby to a battle.

1095
01:18:20,406 --> 01:18:22,251
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

1096
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:27,435


1097
01:18:33,184 --> 01:18:34,799
You've gotta love that dragon.

1098
01:18:37,556 --> 01:18:38,990


1099
01:18:39,744 --> 01:18:41,788
Sorry, we're late for the party.

1100
01:18:41,922 --> 01:18:43,804
You're right on time.

1101
01:18:53,432 --> 01:18:54,725
That's it.
That's it.

1102
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:08,609
How we gonna get him off her
back without hurting her?

1103
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:11,177
Here the facial hair!

1104
01:19:11,202 --> 01:19:12,873


1105
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,750
Whoo!

1106
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:16,886
Ah!!

1107
01:19:16,984 --> 01:19:19,930
Oh! oh?

1108
01:19:20,304 --> 01:19:22,571
- Oh, I have missed this.
- Me too.

1109
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:24,084
Oh! Ah!

1110
01:19:24,481 --> 01:19:25,951
See that there?

1111
01:19:25,976 --> 01:19:27,386
Aw..cute.

1112
01:19:27,703 --> 01:19:29,077
That's a bad omen.

1113
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:30,612
You're cursed.
Ha-ha.

1114
01:19:36,796 --> 01:19:38,972
Yes! Go on!
good on yee!

1115
01:19:39,647 --> 01:19:42,326
Ha-ha. I guess you're
not so bad after all.

1116
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:44,050
- Ahem.
- Hah?

1117
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:07,530
The ship!

1118
01:20:07,798 --> 01:20:09,618
No!

1119
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,309


1120
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:17,958


1121
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:19,340
Woo-hoo!

1122
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:21,177


1123
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:28,130
Oh, we've got problems.

1124
01:20:43,122 --> 01:20:44,685
Get him!
Get him, Hiccup!

1125
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:46,626
- Get him!
- Yeah!

1126
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:56,266
We need a better plan!

1127
01:20:56,736 --> 01:20:58,525
And quick!

1128
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:03,762
What are you--
What are you doing?

1129
01:21:06,298 --> 01:21:07,601
Okay.

1130
01:21:25,721 --> 01:21:26,938
Ah!

1131
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:34,906
You'll kill both of us!

1132
01:21:35,602 --> 01:21:37,100
Fighting over a dragon?

1133
01:21:37,294 --> 01:21:38,865
That's your plan?

1134
01:21:41,826 --> 01:21:43,400
Yes. it is.

1135
01:21:47,643 --> 01:21:49,151
Save him.

1136
01:22:27,147 --> 01:22:28,153
No!

1137
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:35,148
See?

1138
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:36,811
I knew you'd come around.

1139
01:22:58,536 --> 01:23:00,017
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1140
01:23:13,552 --> 01:23:15,239
Hey..good morning, bud.

1141
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:18,868
There you go.

1142
01:23:19,507 --> 01:23:21,433
Well, you're
full of suprises.

1143
01:23:25,017 --> 01:23:26,632
He's all yours.

1144
01:23:36,502 --> 01:23:37,934
- Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

1145
01:23:38,028 --> 01:23:41,065
You know, Eret maybe
blessed with bone, but

1146
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:44,032
just between us,
you have the brains.

1147
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,084
Number one.

1148
01:24:18,806 --> 01:24:20,271
You're right, bud.

1149
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:21,786
It's time.

1150
01:24:23,374 --> 01:24:24,814
I was busy

1151
01:24:24,873 --> 01:24:27,640
fighting for a world
 that I wanted.

1152
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:31,261
I didn't think about
 what you've needed.

1153
01:24:35,063 --> 01:24:36,809
You've looked after us
  for long enough.

1154
01:24:37,927 --> 01:24:39,580
Time to look after yourselves.

1155
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,585
Oh, Stromfly.

1156
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:58,186
- My good girl.
- Alright, Grumply

1157
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:00,449
off you go.

1158
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:06,477
So long, you bigerbly beast.
 I'll miss you

1159
01:25:14,487 --> 01:25:16,255
Oh, Cloudjumper.

1160
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:27,934
Go on, bud.

1161
01:25:28,046 --> 01:25:29,848
Lead them to the hidden world.

1162
01:25:32,016 --> 01:25:33,658
You'll be safe there.

1163
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:36,845
Safer than you could 
ever been with me.

1164
01:25:38,778 --> 01:25:39,785
It's okay.

1165
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:42,680
I love you,too.
And I want you to be free.

1166
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:48,612
Our world doesn't deserve you..

1167
01:25:49,807 --> 01:25:50,813
yet.

1168
01:26:01,914 --> 01:26:03,107
Go, Toothless.

1169
01:26:05,515 --> 01:26:06,486
Go.

1170
01:28:33,805 --> 01:28:35,985
For the chief and chieftess!

1171
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:38,241
- Yeah!
-Yeah!

1172
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:43,831
Come, cry into my full
thick beard.

1173
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,259
 Oh, it's so beautiful!

1174
01:28:46,284 --> 01:28:48,203
- Gross.
- Oh..

1175
01:28:48,438 --> 01:28:49,901
Okay, you win.

1176
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:52,382
I like sensitive guys.

1177
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:53,963
Oh-ho-ho!

1178
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:56,233


1179
01:29:01,688 --> 01:29:02,997


1180
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,517
Yeah!

1181
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:29,039
<i>There were dragons
 when I was a boy.</i>

1182
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:34,664
<i>Oh, there were great 
grim sky dragons</i>

1183
01:29:34,689 --> 01:29:37,861
<i>that nested on the cliff tops
like gigantic scary birds.</i>

1184
01:29:39,886 --> 01:29:42,439
<i>Little brown scuddely dragons had hunted down</i>

1185
01:29:42,464 --> 01:29:45,198
<i>the mice and rats and 
well organized packs.</i>

1186
01:29:46,037 --> 01:29:48,646
<i>But posterously huge sea dragons</i>

1187
01:29:48,671 --> 01:29:52,048
<i>that were 20 times as big
as the big blue whale.</i>

1188
01:29:53,672 --> 01:29:55,624
<i>Some say they crawl back into the sea</i>

1189
01:29:55,649 --> 01:29:59,702
<i>leaving not a bone or
a fang to remember them.</i>

1190
01:30:00,836 --> 01:30:03,580
<i>Others say they were nothing
but folk tales to begin with.</i>

1191
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:07,395
<i>You know what,
 I'm okay with that.</i>

1192
01:30:28,379 --> 01:30:29,582
Hey.

1193
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:31,546
Hey there, bud.

1194
01:30:39,414 --> 01:30:40,972
Remember me?

1195
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,334
- It's okay.
- Oh!

1196
01:30:49,662 --> 01:30:51,411
Ah! Oh-ho-ho.

1197
01:30:54,531 --> 01:30:57,319
Hey, I'm glad to 
see you ,too, bud.

1198
01:30:57,344 --> 01:30:58,283
Ah!

1199
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:00,275
He's not gonna 
eat your father.

1200
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:04,042
How's the tail holding up?

1201
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:06,078
Well, do you want some oil 
and little fine-tuning?

1202
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:07,970
Look, it's okay.

1203
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,600
They're friends.

1204
01:31:14,765 --> 01:31:15,885
Here.

1205
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,922
Go on.
It's alright.

1206
01:31:17,947 --> 01:31:18,614
Come.

1207
01:31:19,678 --> 01:31:21,149
He won't hurt you.

1208
01:31:22,182 --> 01:31:23,545
Hold your hands out.

1209
01:31:23,759 --> 01:31:24,732
Like this.

1210
01:31:26,226 --> 01:31:27,539
That's it.

1211
01:31:31,192 --> 01:31:33,048
Let him come to you.

1212
01:32:23,108 --> 01:32:24,425
- Whoo!
- Ha-ha.

1213
01:32:26,302 --> 01:32:29,162
<i>Legend says that when
 the ground quakes</i>

1214
01:32:29,187 --> 01:32:31,043
<i>or lava spews
 from the earth,</i>

1215
01:32:31,168 --> 01:32:34,546
<i>it's the dragons letting us 
know they're still here,</i>

1216
01:32:36,268 --> 01:32:38,741
<i>waiting for us to figure
out how to get along.</i>

1217
01:32:47,343 --> 01:32:50,032
<i>Yes, the world believes
the dragons are gone,</i>

1218
01:32:50,223 --> 01:32:52,017
<i>if they ever existed at all.</i>

1219
01:32:53,013 --> 01:32:55,762
<i>But we vikings? 
We know otherwise.</i>

1220
01:32:57,647 --> 01:33:00,575
<i>And we'll guard the secret
untill the time comes</i>

1221
01:33:01,225 --> 01:33:04,660
<i>when dragons 
can return in peace.</i>
