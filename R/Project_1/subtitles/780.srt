<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b>.</font>

2
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,530
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

3
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,870
I was careful not to drag in any dirt.

4
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,750
I don't mind the dirt.

5
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,420
I do mind...

6
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,350
...unannounced visits.

7
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,440
You police?

8
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,150
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

9
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,440
- I'm a farmer.
- I saw that.

10
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,450
What do you farm?

11
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,580
It's a protein farm.

12
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,960
Wallace design.

13
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,920
Is that what I smell?

14
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,220
Grow that just for me.

15
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,870
Garlic.

16
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,390
Garlic.

17
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,970
Go on, try some.

18
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,520
No, thank you.

19
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,300
I prefer to keep an empty stomach
until the hard part of the day is done.

20
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,770
How long you been here?

21
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,070
Since 2020.

22
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,560
But you haven't always been a farmer,
have you?

23
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,580
Your bag.

24
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,860
It's colonial medical use.

25
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,290
Military issue.

26
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,910
Where were you? Calantha?

27
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,680
Must have been brutal.

28
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,140
Plan on taking me in?

29
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,270
Let them take a look inside?

30
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,730
Mr. Morton...

31
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,060
...if taking you in is an option...

32
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,230
...I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

33
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,150
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

34
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,650
I'm sorry it had to be me.

35
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,780
Good as any.

36
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,550
Now, if you don't mind...

37
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,180
...if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

38
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,820
Please don't get up.

39
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,240
How's it feel killing your own kind?

40
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,500
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

41
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,550
Only older models do.

42
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,520
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

43
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,180
...because you've never seen a miracle.

44
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,530
Just photograph everything.

45
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,650
Madam, please.

46
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,380
Incoming L.A.P.D. re-codec hash.

47
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,800
You're hurt. I'm not paying for that.

48
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,790
- I'll glue it.
- And?

49
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,520
One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.

50
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,310
He looks like he could take
your head off.

51
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,680
He tried.

52
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,610
He went AWOL after Calantha...

53
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,070
...with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closing out.

54
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,110
- Just him?
- Just him.

55
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,440
Come on home for your baseline.

56
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,410
One moment, madam.

57
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,420
Thirty meters to maximum depth.

58
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,510
What is that?

59
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,820
I'll send a dig team.

60
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,810
Come on home before the storm.

61
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,680
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

62
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,030
- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.

63
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,410
Recite your baseline.

64
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,070
And blood-black nothingness
began to spin.

65
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,120
A system of cells interlinked
within cells...

66
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,340
...interlinked within cells
interlinked within one stem.

67
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,630
Fuck off, skin-job.

68
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,180
And dreadfully distinct against the dark,
a tall white fountain played.

69
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,170
- Cells.
- Cells.

70
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,300
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

71
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,720
- Do they keep you in a cell? Cells.
- Cells.

72
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,770
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

73
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,650
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

74
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,980
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love? Interlinked.

75
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,280
Did they teach you how to feel
finger to finger? Interlinked.

76
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,400
Do you long for having
your heart interlinked? Interlinked.

77
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,940
- Do you dream about being interlinked?
- Interlinked.

78
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,960
What's it like to hold your child
in your arms? Interlinked.

79
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,210
Do you feel that there's a part of you
that's missing? Interlinked.

80
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,790
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within cells interlinked.

81
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,170
Why don't you say that three times?

82
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,220
Within cells interlinked.
Within cells interlinked.

83
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,050
Within cells interlinked.

84
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,880
We're done.

85
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,260
Constant K.

86
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,640
You can pick up your bonus.

87
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,930
Thank you, sir.

88
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,980
Caution, keep clear.

89
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,820
Caution, keep clear.

90
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,530
Caution, keep clear.

91
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,160
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

92
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,740
Packages start at 20 minutes.

93
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,200
Many options available.

94
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,840
Joi goes anywhere you want her to go.

95
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,840
Connect to Off-world any time,
any place.

96
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,970
Packages start at 20 minutes.

97
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,920
K? I didn't hear you. You're early.

98
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,060
You want me to come back?

99
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,470
- Just go scrub.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,230
How was your meeting?

101
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,490
The usual.

102
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,810
How was your day?

103
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,330
I'm getting cabin fever.

104
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,900
99.9 percent detoxified water.

105
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,670
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

106
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm sure I can fix that for you.
Let me take a look at it.

107
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,890
I need a drink.

108
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,180
- Do you want a drink first?
- Pour me one, will you?

109
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,280
I'm trying a new recipe.
I just need a bit more practice.

110
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,490
Don't fuss.

111
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,230
I should have marinated it longer.
I hope it isn't dry.

112
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,250
Did you know this song was released
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

113
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,950
It was number one on the charts.

114
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,960
It won't be much longer.
Just putting on the finishing touches.

115
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,480
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

116
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,220
I told you not to fuss.

117
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,240
And yet...

118
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,320
Voilà! Bon appétit.

119
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,660
I missed you, baby sweet.

120
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,750
Honey, it's beautiful.

121
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,460
Just put your feet up.

122
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,160
Relax.

123
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,260
Was a day?

124
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,860
It was a day.

125
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,570
Would you read to me?

126
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,900
It'll make you feel better.

127
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,820
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

128
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,710
Let's dance.

129
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,370
Do you wanna dance,
or do you wanna open your present?

130
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,130
What present?

131
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,510
- This one.
- What's the occasion?

132
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,420
Let's just say...

133
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,970
- ...it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

134
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,890
No, but let's just say that it is.

135
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,900
Okay?

136
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,980
Happy anniversary.

137
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,070
An emanator.

138
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,410
Thank you.

139
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,990
Honey, you can go anywhere you want
in the world now.

140
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,030
Where do you wanna go first?

141
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,210
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

142
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,850
You don't have to say that.

143
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,260
The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.

144
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,760
Get down here.

145
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,100
Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.

146
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,340
Your box is a military footlocker,
issued to Sapper Morton...

147
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,210
...creatively repurposed as an ossuary:
a box of bones.

148
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,630
Nothing else in it but hair.

149
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,810
The soil samples indicate
that she's been buried for 30 years.

150
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,610
Bones all dismantled, fully cleaned,
meticulously laid to rest.

151
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,430
"She"?

152
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,700
Cause of death, Coco?

153
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,050
No breaks, no sign of trauma, except...

154
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,300
...a fracture through the ilium.

155
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,540
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

156
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,790
She was pregnant?

157
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,430
So he didn't kill her?

158
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,920
She died in childbirth.

159
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,810
What's that?

160
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,510
Go back.

161
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,810
Closer.

162
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,780
Closer.

163
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,980
What's that?

164
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,960
Notching in the iliac crest.

165
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,500
It's fine-point, like a scalpel.

166
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,370
That looks like an emergency C-section.

167
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,210
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

168
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,430
He was a combat medic. Maybe he tried
to save her, and he just couldn't.

169
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,970
He didn't seem like the saving type.

170
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,230
He went to the trouble of burying her.

171
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,900
A sentimental skin-job.

172
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,030
Sorry.

173
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,650
So where's the kid?

174
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,490
You scan the whole field?

175
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,020
Just dirt and worms. No other bodies.

176
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,160
Maybe he ate it.

177
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,710
That's not possible.

178
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,420
She was a Replicant.

179
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,290
Pregnant.

180
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,350
The world is built on a wall.

181
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,900
It separates kind.

182
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,490
Tell either side there's no wall,
you bought a war.

183
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,520
Or a slaughter.

184
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,320
So what you saw...

185
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,330
...didn't happen.

186
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,090
Yes, madam.

187
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,090
It is my job to keep order.

188
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,370
That's what we do here. We keep order.

189
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,040
You want it gone?

190
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,710
Erase everything.

191
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,810
- Even the child?
- All trace.

192
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,310
You have anything more to say?

193
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,980
I've never retired something
that was born before.

194
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,730
What's the difference?

195
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,000
To be born is to have a soul, I guess.

196
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,490
Are you telling me no?

197
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

198
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,300
Attaboy.

199
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,100
Hey. You've been getting on fine
without one.

200
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,310
What's that, madam?

201
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,960
A soul.

202
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,320
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit...

203
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,860
...because you've never seen a miracle.

204
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,340
Just checking in on an old serial number.

205
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,430
Confirmation DNA?

206
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,530
I got hair.

207
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,160
An old one.

208
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,550
Pre-Blackout.

209
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:15,090
That's gonna be tough.

210
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,430
Not much from then.

211
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,710
And what's there is...

212
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,920
...thick milky.

213
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

214
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,430
As human as you want them to be.

215
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,180
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

216
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,030
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence, attachment or appeal.

217
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,080
Unless you'd like to add
some pleasure models to your order.

218
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,670
Would it be possible
to reschedule this call, please?

219
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,520
Everyone remembers where they were
at the Blackout. You?

220
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,270
That was a little before my time.

221
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,520
I was home with my folks,
then 10 days of darkness.

222
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,230
Every machine stopped cold.

223
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,610
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

224
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:19,400
Photos, files, every bit of data, gone.
Bank records too.

225
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,730
Didn't mind that.

226
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,950
It's funny it's only paper that lasted.

227
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,580
I mean, we had everything on drives.
Everything, everything, everything.

228
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,750
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

229
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,210
Well, it's a shame.
You must have been adorable.

230
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,260
Pretty fractured. Not much on it.

231
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,300
One of the last gens, pre-Prohibition.

232
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,340
Standard issue.

233
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,110
- Made by Tyrell.
- And?

234
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,930
Unremarkable.

235
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,360
"Unremarkable"?

236
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,360
There must be something else
we can find for him.

237
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,630
Another prodigal serial number returns.

238
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,090
A 30-year-old open case finally closed.

239
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Thank you, officer.

240
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,210
I'm here for Mr. Wallace. I'm Luv.

241
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,470
He named you.

242
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,140
Must be special.

243
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,350
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

244
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,090
Follow me.

245
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,860
The ancient models give
the entire endeavor a bad name.

246
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,950
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

247
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,160
The outer colonies would never have
flourished had he not bought Tyrell...

248
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,920
...revivified the technology.

249
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,750
To say the least of what we do.

250
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,850
I see you're also a customer.

251
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,550
Are you satisfied with our product?

252
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,860
She's very realistic. Thank you.

253
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,890
Here. All the junk is in here.

254
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,240
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

255
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,800
No one's been down here in ages.

256
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,510
Sorry about that.

257
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,360
All our memory bearings from the time.
They were all damaged in the Blackout.

258
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,520
But there are sometimes fragments.

259
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,090
You got a little boy. He shows you his
butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.

260
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,290
I'd take him to the doctor.

261
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,310
- There's a wasp crawling on your arm.
- I'd kill it.

262
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,140
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

263
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,440
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

264
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,850
Just answer the questions, please.

265
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,950
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

266
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,030
This was a test.

267
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,710
We were difficult to spot then.

268
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,320
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

269
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,340
To warrant an official investigation?

270
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,830
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

271
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,250
Everyone just sleeps better
when they know where they got to.

272
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,470
She likes him.

273
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,940
Who?

274
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,900
This Officer Deckard.

275
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,020
She's trying to provoke him.

276
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,730
It is invigorating
being asked personal questions.

277
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,780
Makes one feel...

278
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,570
...desired.

279
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,080
Do you enjoy your work, officer?

280
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,260
Please thank Mr. Wallace for your time.

281
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,300
You worked with Officer Deckard...

282
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,230
...back in the day.

283
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,180
What can you tell me about him?

284
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,240
He liked to work alone.

285
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,990
So did I.

286
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,450
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

287
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,370
That was it.

288
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,280
Anything else you can tell me?

289
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,700
He wasn't long for this world.

290
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,290
How so?

291
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,800
Something in his eyes.

292
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,770
Any idea how I could contact him?

293
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,980
None.

294
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,900
He's nyugdíjas.

295
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,850
Retired.

296
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,030
What happened?

297
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,980
Probably got what he wanted.

298
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,330
To be alone.

299
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,800
Welcome back, sir.

300
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,480
You wanted to review the new model,
sir, before shipment?

301
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,400
An angel should never enter
the kingdom of heaven...

302
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,070
...without a gift.

303
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,450
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

304
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,970
A new model.

305
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,140
Well, let us see her, then.

306
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,900
The first thought...

307
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,860
...one tends to fear...

308
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,820
...to preserve the clay.

309
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,620
It's fascinating.

310
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,410
Before we even know what we are...

311
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,380
...we fear to lose it.

312
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,850
Happy birthday.

313
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,770
Now, let's have a look at you.

314
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,820
We make angels...

315
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,290
...in the service of civilization.

316
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,950
Yes, there were bad angels once.

317
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,590
I make good angels now.

318
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,750
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

319
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,850
Nine.

320
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,220
A child can count to nine on fingers.

321
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,360
We should own the stars.

322
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,940
Yes, sir.

323
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,690
Every leap of civilization was built off
the back of a disposable workforce.

324
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,070
We lost our stomach for slaves...

325
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,650
...unless engineered.

326
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,200
But I can only make so many.

327
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,640
That barren pasture...

328
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,640
...empty...

329
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,630
...and salted...

330
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,720
...right here.

331
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,570
The dead space between the stars.

332
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,020
And this, the seat
that we must change for heaven.

333
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,780
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

334
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,490
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

335
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,700
Millions, so we can be trillions more.

336
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,590
We could storm Eden and retake her.

337
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,320
Tyrell's final trick:

338
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,440
Procreation.

339
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,860
Perfected, then lost.

340
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,780
But there is a child.

341
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,870
Bring it to me.

342
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,790
Sir.

343
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,470
The best angel of all.

344
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,510
Aren't you, Luv?

345
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,840
The man with the green jacket.

346
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,880
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

347
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,370
Hi.

348
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,650
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

349
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,650
You alone?

350
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,250
It's fine.

351
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,500
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

352
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,190
Oh, you don't even smile.

353
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,560
Didn't you hear your friends?

354
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,570
Don't you know what I am?

355
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,480
Yeah.

356
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,770
Guy eating rice.

357
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,450
What's that?

358
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,400
It's a tree.

359
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:20,790
Never seen a tree before.

360
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,670
It's pretty.

361
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,340
It's dead.

362
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,590
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

363
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,340
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

364
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,150
Depends. What's your model number?

365
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,820
Why don't you look under my eye
and find out?

366
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,410
You don't like real girls.

367
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,360
Well, I'm always here.

368
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,710
Hi.

369
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,130
You can't take those.

370
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,420
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

371
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,310
Hold this for me.

372
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,050
Yep. Here you go.

373
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,070
Coco is dead.

374
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,340
Bones are gone.

375
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,670
It's out. Already out.
How long did that take?

376
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,050
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

377
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,640
I found that.

378
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,920
A sock?

379
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,850
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

380
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,110
Anything else?

381
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,520
I burned everything else.

382
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,940
Then what's this? What's that date?
Is that a birthday? A death day?

383
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,780
I don't know yet.

384
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,980
Am I the only one that can see
the fucking sunrise here?

385
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,250
This breaks the world, K.

386
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:07,220
You know, I've known a lot of your kind.

387
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,060
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

388
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,550
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

389
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,730
Do you remember anything?

390
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,610
Before you were under me,
you have any memories from before?

391
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,990
I have memories...

392
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,490
...but they're not real.
They're just implants.

393
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,080
Tell me one.

394
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,510
From when you were a kid.

395
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,850
I feel strange sharing a childhood story,
considering I was never a child.

396
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,470
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

397
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,350
I have one about a toy that I had.

398
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,600
A wooden horse.

399
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:07,160
With an inscription underneath.

400
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,780
All I remember is a group of boys
trying to take it away from me.

401
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,120
So I run.

402
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,440
I go looking for a place to hide it,
and the only place is this dark furnace.

403
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:50,110
It's very dark, and I'm very scared...

404
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,870
...but this horse is all I have,
so I go in anyway.

405
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,330
Later on, those kids find me...

406
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,170
...and they beat me to tell them
where it is, but I don't.

407
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,560
That's it.

408
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,100
Little K, fighting for what's his.

409
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,020
It's a good one.

410
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,240
Look at me.

411
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,320
We're all just looking out
for something real.

412
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,720
What happens if I finish that?

413
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,840
Shouldn't I get back to work, madam?

414
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,610
Check back in after DNAbase.

415
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,170
Officer KD6 - 3.7.

416
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,380
Request.

417
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,540
DNA records: children born 6-10-21.

418
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,750
Looking for anomalies.

419
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,720
You have the satcrystal backup?

420
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,100
Okay.

421
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,520
Run it raw.

422
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,360
Mere data makes a man.

423
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,890
A and C and T and G.

424
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:38,940
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

425
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,610
I'm only two:

426
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,870
One and zero.

427
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,550
Half as much but twice as elegant,
sweetheart.

428
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,920
You don't prefer your madam?

429
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,220
You were listening.

430
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,550
Maybe.

431
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,480
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

432
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,310
Six, 10 and 21.

433
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,930
There's nothing to tell.

434
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,940
How many times
have you told me that story?

435
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,700
Your memory?

436
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,150
The date carved beneath.

437
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,490
Six, 10 and 21.

438
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,170
Coincidence?

439
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,970
A dangerous coincidence.

440
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,670
I always knew you were special.

441
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,510
Maybe this is how.

442
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,850
A child.

443
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:56,480
Of woman born.

444
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,950
Pushed into the world.

445
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,870
Wanted.

446
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,830
Loved.

447
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,490
Well, if it were true...

448
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,760
...I'd be hunted for the rest of my life
by someone just like me.

449
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,800
It's okay to dream a little.

450
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,300
- Isn't it?
- Not if you're us.

451
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,770
Stop.

452
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:35,810
Put up 4847 and 2181 side-by-side.

453
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,580
They're identical. Translate.

454
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,460
A boy and a girl.

455
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,280
- It's impossible.
- Why?

456
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,160
Two people can't have identical DNA.

457
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,180
One of these isn't real. It's a copy.

458
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,060
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

459
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,440
It says the girl died there.

460
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,730
Genetic disorder.

461
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,940
Galatians Syndrome.

462
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,950
And the boy...

463
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,650
...disappears.

464
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,400
Where's the orphanage?

465
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:35,000
You wanna go for a ride?

466
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,530
Well, here we are.

467
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,330
Buckle up.

468
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,850
K?

469
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,460
K? K?

470
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,870
K? K? K?

471
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,920
Stay back.

472
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,860
Fire again.

473
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,990
Fire again.

474
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,360
Fire.

475
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,460
Two hundred feet to the east.

476
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,340
Fire.

477
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,760
Go north.

478
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,550
Fire.

479
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:48,650
Stop. Twenty degrees east.

480
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,560
Stop.

481
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,520
Zoom in.

482
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:57,480
Closer.

483
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,830
Oh, come on.

484
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:04,530
Get up.

485
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,030
Do your fucking job.

486
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,590
Find the child.

487
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,040
Watch the car.

488
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,730
Every last piece, or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining...

489
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,940
...where it's raining fire!

490
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,810
You're in here to work.

491
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,240
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

492
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,820
I don't need any of...

493
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,450
Hi.

494
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,830
The nickel is for the colonial ships.

495
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,800
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get...

496
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,220
...to that grand life Off-world.

497
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:04,330
And I encourage play, I do.
Keeps them occupied...

498
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:07,140
...and it makes them nimble, right?

499
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:08,560
But it's work.

500
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:13,510
It's work that molds them
into a child worth having.

501
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,900
So come on, now.

502
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,370
What sort do you have in mind?

503
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,120
Because I got all kinds.

504
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,840
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buying.

505
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,090
No, no, no. This is just my game,
and I play it fair.

506
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:45,130
No. No, I mean, bigger than you...

507
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,230
Bigger than you have tried
to shut me down. Bigger than you.

508
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:54,270
And they were men, at that.

509
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,440
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

510
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,780
I need to see your records.

511
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,030
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

512
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,490
Don't keep records that far back.

513
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,650
- You don't?
- I don't.

514
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,290
Sorry.

515
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,280
Can't help you.

516
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,910
- You can't?
- Nope.

517
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,960
I think you can.

518
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,840
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

519
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,810
Now you can tell me
what you remember...

520
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:36,260
...or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

521
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:53,610
They were laughing and what was it
you said? What'd you say?

522
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,510
Are you coming?

523
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,030
Where is it?

524
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,650
Oh, God.

525
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:38,170
Where, where, where?

526
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:42,580
I don't see it. Here.

527
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,350
It's gone.

528
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,590
It's the entire year.

529
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,890
I didn't do that.

530
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,980
That wasn't me.

531
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,980
I didn't. Wasn't me.

532
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,970
I always told you.

533
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,930
You're special.

534
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,600
Born.

535
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,320
Not made.

536
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:00,950
Hidden with care.

537
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,290
A real boy now.

538
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,070
A real boy needs a real name.

539
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:13,920
Joe.

540
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,450
"Joe"?

541
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,960
You're too important for K.

542
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:22,720
Your mother would've named you.

543
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,850
Joe.

544
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:31,470
- Joe.
- Stop.

545
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,140
How do I know
if a memory is an implant or not?

546
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,870
Who makes the memories?

547
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,310
Dr. Ana Stelline?

548
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:25,560
A visitor.

549
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,440
Is that okay?

550
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:30,950
Yes.

551
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,250
It's just unusual.

552
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,630
Nice to meet you, Officer KD6 - 3.7.

553
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:49,290
Sorry.
It's a compromised immune system.

554
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:53,520
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

555
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:56,730
- Is that why you're not Off-world?
- Yes.

556
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:01,350
My parents had our passes in pocket,
but I took sick.

557
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,690
So it was a new life for me.

558
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:10,240
And they put me in my cage...

559
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,490
...filled it with everything they could
to keep me happy.

560
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:18,580
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

561
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,950
What can I help you with?

562
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,010
Thought you might be able to help me
with a case.

563
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:34,310
Oh, that's the most interesting thing
I've been offered to help with in ages.

564
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:38,270
Do you mind if I work while you talk?

565
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:40,800
Of course.

566
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,410
I promise I hear every word.

567
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:59,820
They say you're
the best memory-maker there is.

568
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,040
Well, then, they're kind.

569
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,700
I love birthday parties.

570
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,350
You work for Wallace?

571
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,020
Subcontract. I'm one of his suppliers.

572
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,310
He offered to buy me out,
but I take my freedom where I can find it.

573
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:22,180
Why are you so good?

574
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,280
What makes your memories
so authentic?

575
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:29,320
Well, there's a bit of every artist
in their work.

576
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,200
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8...

577
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:39,450
...so if I wanted to see the world,
I had to imagine it.

578
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:44,090
Got very good at imagining.

579
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,960
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

580
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,380
I think it's only kind.

581
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:59,340
Replicants live such hard lives,
made to do what we'd rather not.

582
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,800
I can't help your future...

583
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:05,720
...but I can give you good memories
to think back on and smile.

584
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,940
It's nice.

585
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,700
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

586
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:16,580
And if you have authentic memories,
you have real human responses.

587
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,240
Wouldn't you agree?

588
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:31,120
Are they all constructed,
or do you ever use ones that are real?

589
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:38,270
It's illegal to use real memories, officer.

590
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,340
How can you tell the difference?

591
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,900
Can you tell if something...

592
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:47,360
...really happened?

593
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,450
They all think it's about more detail.

594
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,730
But that's not how memory works.

595
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:57,860
We recall with our feelings.

596
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:02,160
Anything real should be a mess.

597
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,450
I can show you.

598
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:08,250
Sit.

599
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:31,390
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

600
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,850
Not even that hard. Just picture it.

601
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,120
Let it play.

602
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,530
Someone lived this, yes.

603
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,880
This happened.

604
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,260
I know it's real.

605
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,410
I know it's real.

606
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:11,000
Goddamn it!

607
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:59,300
Officer KD6 - 3.7.
Madam is calling you in.

608
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,500
You're under arrest.

609
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,750
Drop your gun and keep your hands
where I can see them.

610
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:05,560
- Cells.
- Cells.

611
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,100
Have you ever been
in an institution? Cells.

612
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,640
When you're not performing your duties,
do they keep you in a little box? Cells.

613
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,020
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

614
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,780
What's it like to hold the hand
of someone you love?

615
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:19,740
- Interlinked.
- Interlinked.

616
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,280
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

617
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:26,360
What's it like
to be filled with dread? Dreadfully.

618
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:29,360
Do you like being separated
from other people? Distinct.

619
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:32,530
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.
- Dreadfully distinct. Dark.

620
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,020
- Within cells interlinked.
- Within the cells interlinked.

621
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,660
- Within one stem.
- Within one stem.

622
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:40,160
- And dreadfully distinct.
- And dreadfully distinct.

623
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,050
- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.

624
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:46,380
- A tall white fountain played.
- A tall white fountain played.

625
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:52,020
You're not even close to baseline.

626
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,770
Out! And close the door.

627
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,490
What the fuck is with you?

628
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,700
I put you on a case.

629
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,110
I impressed on you
the importance of that case...

630
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,120
...and then we pick you up fucking
around outside an upgrade center?

631
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:17,000
Scan said you didn't look like you
on the inside. Miles off your baseline.

632
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,160
- Do you know what that means?
- I found the kid.

633
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,920
He was set up like a standard Replicant,
put on a service job.

634
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:33,470
Even he didn't know who he was.

635
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,760
- And?
- And it's done.

636
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:40,270
- What does that mean, "it's done"?
- What you asked.

637
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,310
It's done.

638
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,570
Fuck.

639
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,650
You just stopped a bomb from going off.

640
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,490
You did good.

641
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,790
I can help you get out
of this station alive...

642
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,050
...but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

643
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,680
Surrender your gun and badge.

644
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,260
And your next baseline test
is out of my hands.

645
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:12,390
Thank you, madam.

646
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,290
You were right.

647
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,810
You were right about everything.

648
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:27,710
Thought you weren't interested,
worky man.

649
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,350
You liked her. I could tell.

650
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:35,930
It's okay.

651
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,140
She's real.

652
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,730
I wanna be real for you.

653
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,280
You are real for me.

654
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,980
You have a special lady here.

655
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:08,750
Okay.

656
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,220
Let's do it.

657
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:34,490
Look at you.

658
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,150
Quiet now, I have to sync.

659
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,130
Joi is anything you want her to be.

660
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,100
Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.

661
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:15,410
99.9 percent detoxified water.

662
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:46,400
It's from a tree.

663
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,400
I'm done with you.

664
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,790
You can go now.

665
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:04,090
Quiet now.

666
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,970
I've been inside you.

667
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:09,210
Not so much there as you think.

668
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,360
Coffee?

669
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:37,830
They'll be coming after me soon.

670
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:48,460
I'm coming with you.

671
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:50,100
But not like this.

672
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:56,220
If they come here looking for you,
they'll have access to all my memories.

673
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:59,310
You have to delete me
from the console.

674
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:01,850
My present.

675
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,360
Put me there.

676
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,280
I can't do that.

677
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:12,250
Think about it:

678
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:15,110
If anything happens to this, that's it.

679
01:33:16,580 --> 01:33:17,710
You're gone.

680
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:19,870
Yes.

681
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,220
Like a real girl.

682
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:30,340
Please.

683
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,590
Joe, please.

684
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,600
I want this.

685
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:44,230
But I can't do it myself.

686
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,870
Break the antenna.

687
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:44,620
I don't need a real horse.

688
01:34:48,090 --> 01:34:53,220
I don't need a real horse.
I just wanna find out where it's from.

689
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,820
Radiation from a reactor?

690
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:14,030
It matches a dirty bomb.

691
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:25,210
There's only one place that dirty.

692
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,630
Nobody lives there.

693
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,050
Go to five.

694
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,440
Four, 30 degrees to the left.

695
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:27,890
Tilt up.

696
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,700
Elevate to 400 feet.

697
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,330
Radiation analysis.

698
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:44,830
Move forward.

699
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,080
Tilt up.

700
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,750
Stop.

701
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,390
Move forward.

702
01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:00,850
Go to five.

703
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,520
Seven, move forward.

704
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:10,470
Six.

705
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:13,200
Stop.

706
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:17,400
Go to seven.

707
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:19,400
Eight.

708
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,860
Nine.

709
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:27,450
Heat analysis.

710
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,550
Life.

711
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:38,800
What is it?

712
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,600
Guess we're about to find out.

713
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:53,320
Too dark in here.

714
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,070
I like him.

715
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,620
He's a good boy.

716
01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:03,360
Where is he?

717
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,960
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

718
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,040
Check around.

719
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:16,960
I checked...

720
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:20,210
...anywhere a good boy might go.

721
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,560
You're too late.

722
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,090
It's gone.

723
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,900
He destroyed it.

724
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:36,480
Everything about it.

725
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:39,870
Well, except for the box of bones
that you already took.

726
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:48,170
Which, I'll wager, wasn't enough.
Here you are.

727
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:57,840
You tiny thing.

728
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:02,970
In the face of the fabulous new,
your only thought is to kill it?

729
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:06,850
For fear of great change?

730
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:10,680
You can't hold the tide with a broom.

731
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,940
Except that I did.

732
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,600
Where is he?!

733
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:21,450
You're so sure.

734
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,860
Because he told you.

735
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:27,360
Because we never lie.

736
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:32,170
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

737
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:35,290
So I had to kill you.

738
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,050
Then do what you gotta do.

739
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:43,850
Madam.

740
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,090
Location: Officer KD6 - 3.7.

741
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:12,720
Mightn't happen to have
a piece of cheese about you, now?

742
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,220
Would you, boy?

743
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:31,140
Treasure Island?

744
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,120
He reads.

745
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:42,710
That's good.

746
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:45,200
Me too.

747
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,670
Not much else to do around here
at night anymore.

748
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Many is the night I dream of cheese...

749
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:03,810
...toasted, mostly.

750
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,760
What are you doing here?

751
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,730
I heard the piano.

752
01:46:15,150 --> 01:46:16,820
Don't lie.

753
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,150
It's rude.

754
01:46:21,450 --> 01:46:23,290
You're a cop.

755
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:26,750
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

756
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,090
Then, what?

757
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,630
I just have some questions.

758
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:37,760
What questions?

759
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,150
Stay.

760
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:33,350
Look, I don't wanna hurt you.

761
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:35,590
But you're not making it easy.

762
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:26,980
I like this song.

763
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:40,950
We could keep at this,
or we could get a drink.

764
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:55,020
I'll take the drink.

765
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,110
This is really something.

766
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:07,390
The whole town was something.

767
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:09,410
One time.

768
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:13,200
Forget your troubles...

769
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,250
...see a show...

770
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:19,790
...gamble a little.

771
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,870
Win some money, lose some money.

772
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:29,040
They made money seem like candy.

773
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:31,130
You like whiskey?

774
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:33,510
I've got millions...

775
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:36,100
...of bottles of whiskey.

776
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,820
Here.

777
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,830
Bleeding.

778
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:07,370
Is it real?

779
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,000
I don't know.

780
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:11,960
Ask him.

781
01:52:28,270 --> 01:52:29,350
You got a name?

782
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:33,230
Officer KD6 - 3.7...

783
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:36,190
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

784
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,660
All right.

785
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,540
Joe.

786
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:46,920
What do you want, Joe?

787
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,090
- I wanna ask you some questions.
- Like what?

788
01:52:57,430 --> 01:53:01,640
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

789
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:09,810
What was she like?

790
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:24,780
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

791
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:27,030
I had your job. I was good at it.

792
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:30,170
- It was simpler then.
- Why you making it complicated?

793
01:53:30,330 --> 01:53:32,660
- Why don't you answer the question?
- What question?

794
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:35,840
I didn't figure you as one for bullshit.

795
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:37,800
What's her name?

796
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,990
Rachael.

797
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,870
Her name was Rachael.

798
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,360
What happened to the kid?

799
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:11,540
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

800
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,630
I was long gone by then.

801
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:22,220
You didn't even meet your own kid?

802
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,190
Why?

803
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,650
Because that was the plan.

804
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:36,070
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

805
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:39,580
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

806
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:43,240
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

807
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:45,830
Couldn't have found the child if I tried.

808
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:48,530
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

809
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:53,260
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

810
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:55,760
I didn't want our child found...

811
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:59,790
...taken apart, dissected.

812
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:06,510
Sometimes, to love someone...

813
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:10,560
...you gotta be a stranger.

814
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:33,200
To strangers.

815
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,470
What'd you do?

816
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:48,250
Who'd you bring?

817
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:52,840
- No one.
- Oh, yeah?

818
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,470
Target locked.

819
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:03,140
They know you're here.

820
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:07,110
I came alone.

821
02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:14,870
Bad dog.

822
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,180
Stop.

823
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:52,350
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

824
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:55,150
I love...

825
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:13,350
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

826
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:16,030
You can trust us.

827
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:27,370
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

828
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:34,330
This is Freysa.

829
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:37,590
She fought with Sapper on Calantha.

830
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:39,670
I recognize you.

831
02:04:41,630 --> 02:04:43,590
Did you help him hide the child?

832
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,760
I was there.

833
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:53,720
I saw a miracle delivered.

834
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:58,140
A perfect little face crying up at me.

835
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,890
Mad as thunder.

836
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:15,670
Were you with her?

837
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:18,750
Rachael?

838
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:21,550
I held her as she died.

839
02:05:22,510 --> 02:05:27,180
We hid the child
and made a vow to keep our secret.

840
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:30,130
That's why Sapper let you kill him.

841
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:37,820
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

842
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:40,980
If a baby can come from one of us...

843
02:05:41,150 --> 02:05:44,320
...we are our own masters.

844
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,160
More human than humans.

845
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:50,780
A revolution is coming.

846
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:53,870
And we're building an army.

847
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:56,750
I want to free our people.

848
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:06,930
If you want to be free...

849
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:09,380
...join us.

850
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:17,110
Deckard, Sapper, you, me...

851
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:21,240
...our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

852
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:26,690
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

853
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,820
You led Wallace to Deckard.

854
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:36,540
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

855
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:38,580
You must kill Deckard.

856
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,520
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

857
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:52,730
And she is.

858
02:06:55,390 --> 02:06:58,810
When the time comes,
I will show her to the world...

859
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:01,110
...and she will lead our army.

860
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,680
"She"?

861
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:04,740
Of course.

862
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:07,240
Rachael had a daughter.

863
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:11,620
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

864
02:07:12,110 --> 02:07:14,950
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

865
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:17,210
It was a boy that you hid.

866
02:07:19,410 --> 02:07:22,910
That is just a piece of the puzzle.

867
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:42,360
You imagined it was you?

868
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:46,700
You did.

869
02:07:47,190 --> 02:07:48,770
You did.

870
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,110
We all wish it was us.

871
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,660
That's why we believe.

872
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:15,510
Someone lived this, yes.

873
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:22,550
I showed them how to scramble
the records, cover their tracks.

874
02:08:22,730 --> 02:08:25,110
With my own eyes, I saw her come.

875
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:30,910
I dressed her in blue
when it was time for her to go.

876
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,620
There's a bit of every
artist in their work.

877
02:09:12,030 --> 02:09:14,780
Always jumping, that one.

878
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:18,530
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

879
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:24,660
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

880
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:33,640
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

881
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:55,570
You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard.

882
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:02,660
I had the lock.

883
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:06,830
I found the key.

884
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,220
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

885
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:19,310
I need the specimen to reach it,
Mr. Deckard.

886
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:24,140
The child.

887
02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:26,810
I need the child.

888
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:30,890
To teach them all to fly.

889
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:43,610
And God remembered Rachel...

890
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,830
...heeded her and opened her womb.

891
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:52,460
Do you like our owl?

892
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,630
It's artificial?

893
02:10:57,630 --> 02:10:59,750
Of course it is.

894
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:02,930
Must be expensive.

895
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:07,180
Very. I'm Rachael.

896
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,810
Deckard.

897
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:23,750
Is it the same...

898
02:11:24,740 --> 02:11:27,700
...now, as then...

899
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:32,120
...the moment you met her?

900
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:44,800
All these years
you looked back on that day...

901
02:11:44,970 --> 02:11:48,840
...drunk on the memory
of its perfection.

902
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,690
How shiny her lips.

903
02:11:53,850 --> 02:11:56,890
How instant your connection.

904
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:04,690
Did it never occur to you that's why
you were summoned in the first place?

905
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:12,130
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there.

906
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:19,710
All to make that single perfect specimen.

907
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:25,930
That is, if you were designed.

908
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:28,380
Love...

909
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:31,520
...or mathematical precision.

910
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:38,560
Yes.

911
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:40,990
No.

912
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,610
I know what's real.

913
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:14,650
It was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information...

914
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:18,980
...and all it cost you was everything.

915
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:24,320
But you can still help me.

916
02:13:26,200 --> 02:13:29,910
You had help in the hiding.

917
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:34,030
Where did they go?

918
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:37,240
I know you know something.

919
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,290
Help me...

920
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:44,970
...and very, very good things
can come to you.

921
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:52,480
You don't have children...

922
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,720
...do you?

923
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,530
Oh, I have millions.

924
02:14:02,230 --> 02:14:05,560
You think I have nothing to offer but pain.

925
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:08,080
Only I know...

926
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:10,650
...you love pain.

927
02:14:11,870 --> 02:14:16,790
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

928
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:20,410
More joy, then.

929
02:14:26,470 --> 02:14:28,600
Do not be afraid.

930
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:44,910
An angel...

931
02:14:46,070 --> 02:14:47,200
...made again.

932
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:53,370
For you.

933
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,400
Did you miss me?

934
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:49,130
Don't you love me?

935
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,240
Her eyes were green.

936
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:29,390
Off-world...

937
02:16:29,550 --> 02:16:33,310
...I have everything I need
to make you talk.

938
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:37,850
You do not know what pain is yet.

939
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:40,840
You will learn.

940
02:16:52,650 --> 02:16:54,690
Hello, handsome.

941
02:17:11,460 --> 02:17:13,920
What a day.

942
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,380
You look lonely.

943
02:17:20,680 --> 02:17:23,140
I can fix that.

944
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:28,680
You look like a good joe.

945
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:09,980
Dying for the right cause
is the most human thing we can do.

946
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:15,280
Because you've never seen a miracle.

947
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:56,610
You're entering Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.

948
02:18:56,780 --> 02:18:59,080
Confirm your identity.

949
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:02,120
Transport S-14-4-XD. Confirmed.

950
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:03,990
Space, this is 0-6.

951
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:06,880
Outbound departure, route 0-3-0.

952
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,960
Where are we going?

953
02:19:09,710 --> 02:19:11,340
Home.

954
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:08,010
Drive two down.

955
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:10,260
Backup engaged.

956
02:20:11,230 --> 02:20:12,270
Warning.

957
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,240
- Can we make it?
- We're too low!

958
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:16,530
Take us back!

959
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,750
Get us up.

960
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:33,140
Open the door.

961
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,430
I'm the best one.

962
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:11,050
Off-world is waiting.

963
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:27,180
Joe. Joe!

964
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,530
Joe!

965
02:27:17,490 --> 02:27:19,700
You should have let me die out there.

966
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:22,330
You did.

967
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,130
You drowned out there.

968
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:35,290
You're free to meet your daughter now.

969
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:03,800
All the best memories are hers.

970
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:14,150
Why?

971
02:29:16,690 --> 02:29:18,610
Who am I to you?

972
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:29,870
Go meet your daughter.

973
02:29:35,790 --> 02:29:37,250
You okay?

974
02:32:13,530 --> 02:32:15,360
Just a moment.

975
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,000
Beautiful, isn't it?
