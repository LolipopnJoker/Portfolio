1
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,705
Baltimore, Maryland 1980

2
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,993
<i>Think to yourself
that every day is your last...</i>

3
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,166
<i>the hour to which
you do not look forward...</i>

4
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,247
<i>will come as a welcome surprise.</i>

5
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:07,822
<i>As for me...</i>

6
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:09,262
<i>when you want a good laugh...</i>

7
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,816
<i>you will find me, in a fine state...</i>

8
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,673
<i>fat and sleek...</i>

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,942
<i>a true hog of Epicurus' herd.</i>

10
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:22,632
And we find you cribbing lines
from Horace, as well.

11
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:25,038
Well done, John.

12
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,761
I must say, Hannibal...

13
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:28,774
speaking for the rest of the herd...

14
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:32,391
I'm sorry, for the Symphony Board...

15
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,732
that these little soirees of yours...

16
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,037
are always the highlight of our year.

17
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:39,590
- Just so.
- You're too kind.

18
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:44,525
I do feel guilty enjoying
tonight when a musician is...

19
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:46,533
still listed as a missing person.

20
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,233
Yes, poor fellow.

21
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,175
Shall I confess something wicked?

22
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:56,135
I can't help feeling
the tiniest bit... relieved.

23
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,208
It sounds awful, I know.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,149
But, let's face it,
so does the man's playing.

25
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,490
Hannibal, confess.

26
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,911
What is this divine-looking
amuse-bouche?

27
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,277
If I tell you...

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,669
I'm afraid you won't even try it.

29
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:20,391
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

30
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,335
Special Agent Graham.
What an unexpected pleasure.

31
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:42,441
I'm sorry to bother you again,
Dr. Lecter. I know it's late.

32
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:45,577
It's no bother.
We're both night owls, I think.

33
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:47,911
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

34
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,837
Let me take your coat.

35
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:52,013
What's on your mind?

36
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,854
We've been on the wrong track
this whole time. You and I.

37
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,991
Our whole profile's wrong.

38
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:00,841
We've been looking for someone
with a crazy grudge...

39
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:02,951
and some kind of anatomical knowledge.

40
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:05,958
Decertified doctors,
med school dropouts...

41
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:07,209
laid-off mortuary workers...

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,109
From the precision of the cuts,
and his choice of souvenirs.

43
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:12,644
That's where we're off-target.

44
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,859
He's not collecting body parts.

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,854
- Then why keep them?
- He's not. He's eating them.

46
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:23,114
No, listen. We were at
Molly's parents' for New Year's...

47
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,038
and her dad was showing
my son, Josh...

48
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:26,958
how to carve a roasted chicken.

49
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,838
He said, "The tenderest part
of the chicken is the oysters...

50
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,725
"on either side of the back."

51
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:35,919
I had never heard that
expression before, "oysters."

52
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:40,071
Then suddenly I had a flash
of the third victim...

53
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:41,419
Darcy Taylor.

54
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:45,132
She was missing flesh from
her back. And then it hit me.

55
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:48,265
Liver, kidney, tongue, thymus.

56
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:51,849
Every single victim lost
some body part used in cooking.

57
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:55,142
Have you shared this with the Bureau?

58
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:58,696
No, I needed to see you first.
But I'm right. I know I'm right.

59
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,102
I'm starting to be able to think
like this one.

60
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,859
Yeah, it's fascinating.

61
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,404
You know, I'd always suspected
as much. You are an eidetiker.

62
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,605
I'm not psychic, Doctor.

63
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:11,567
No, this is different.

64
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:13,798
More akin to artistic imagination.

65
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,455
You can assume the emotional
point of view of others...

66
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,973
even those that might scare
or sicken you.

67
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,597
It's a troubling gift, I should think.

68
00:05:22,703 --> 00:05:25,224
How I'd love to get you on my couch.

69
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,588
Something still doesn't
make sense to me.

70
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,721
You're the best
forensic psychiatrist I know...

71
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,341
and somehow,
in all our time together...

72
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,326
this possibility
never occurred to you.

73
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:40,741
I am only human, Will.
Perhaps I made a mistake.

74
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:44,326
You don't strike me as a man
who makes very many mistakes.

75
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,893
Now I'm sorry to think I might...

76
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:48,139
no longer enjoy your full confidence.

77
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,500
No, I didn't say that.

78
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,562
I don't know what I'm saying.

79
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,804
I'm very, very tired.

80
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:02,889
I almost had it.

81
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:05,482
It'll come to you.

82
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,006
Why don't you come back
in the morning?

83
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:10,251
I'll clear some time
on my schedule and...

84
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,839
then we can get started
in revising our profile.

85
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,537
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

86
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,063
Rest here, and I'll get your coat.

87
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,849
Won't be a tick.

88
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:19,562
Don't move.

89
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:23,399
You're in shock now. I don't
want you to feel any pain.

90
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:27,530
In a moment you'll begin to be
light-headed. Then drowsy.

91
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,785
Don't resist. It's so gentle.
Like slipping into a warm bath.

92
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,903
I regret it came to this, Will.

93
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:39,180
But every game must have its ending.

94
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:46,630
Remarkable boy.

95
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,775
I do admire your courage.

96
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:53,035
I think I'll eat your heart.

97
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:50,988
Marathon, Florida Several Years Later

98
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:08,744
Hey, Dad. Someone's here.

99
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:14,824
Hey.

100
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,859
You've got
a beautiful setup here, Will.

101
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,302
Yeah, it's good.

102
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:24,846
- You know why I'm here?
- Yeah, I can guess.

103
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,429
How much do you know?

104
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:30,537
Just what was in
the Miami Herald and the Times.

105
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,188
Two families killed
a month apart in their homes.

106
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:38,124
Birmingham and Atlanta.
The circumstances were similar.

107
00:11:39,088 --> 00:11:40,910
Not similar. The same.

108
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,720
What have you kept out of the papers?

109
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,475
He smashes mirrors
and uses the pieces.

110
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,283
Wears latex gloves, so we've got
no prints. Size 11 shoe.

111
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:53,710
He's not too comfortable with locks.

112
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,662
Pried open a patio door
in Birmingham...

113
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,548
used a glass cutter in Atlanta.

114
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:00,617
And his blood's AB positive.

115
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,141
- Somebody hurt him?
- Nope.

116
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:07,428
We typed him from semen
and saliva. He's a secretor.

117
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:14,986
Tell me something, Will.
You knew what this was.

118
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,759
Did you ever consider picking up
the phone and giving me a call?

119
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:20,141
You've got all the people you need.

120
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,950
You've got Dortmund at Harvard.
You got Bloom in Chicago.

121
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,219
I've got you down here
fixing boat motors?

122
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,621
Yeah, I like fixing boat motors.

123
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,502
I wouldn't be very useful to you.

124
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,942
I don't think about it anymore.

125
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,592
Really?
The last two we had, you caught.

126
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:38,216
By doing what you
and the other guys are doing.

127
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,687
That's not entirely true.
It's the way you think.

128
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:44,265
Come on. There's been a lot of
bullshit about the way I think.

129
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,473
I've got technicians
to examine evidence...

130
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:47,885
but you've got that other thing.

131
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:51,115
Imagination. Projection.
Whatever.

132
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:54,857
- I know you don't like it.
- You wouldn't like it, either.

133
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,377
This freak killed the Jacobis
in Birmingham...

134
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,901
on Saturday night, February 25.
Full moon.

135
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,863
He killed the Leeds family
in Atlanta...

136
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,137
a few nights ago, March 28.

137
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,996
One day short of a lunar month.

138
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:28,453
If we're lucky, we may have
a little over three weeks...

139
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,186
before he does it again.

140
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:32,876
Will, do you respect my judgment?

141
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,624
Of course.

142
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:39,111
I think we have a better chance
to catch him fast if you help.

143
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,703
Go to Atlanta and look.
Just look.

144
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,872
Then help me brief the locals.
That's it.

145
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:47,973
Crawford has
the whole damn government.

146
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,062
Why does he need you?

147
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,950
He just wants me to look
at some evidence, Molly.

148
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:54,219
Give him another point of view.

149
00:13:54,864 --> 00:13:57,897
It's a few days, a week maybe,
and I'll be right back.

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,139
- And you believed that?
- Yes.

151
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,200
These kinds of cases
come up very rarely...

152
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:05,581
and I've had experience.

153
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,141
Yes, you have.

154
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,636
You're paid up, Will.

155
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,673
All of us. Even Josh.

156
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,793
There's a chance I could
help them save some lives.

157
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:21,318
How do I say no to that?

158
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,199
This one will never see me
or know my name.

159
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,887
I'll just help them find him.

160
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,708
The cops will take him down, not me.

161
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,738
I'll be in the back of the pack,
Molly, I promise.

162
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,563
Never in your life.

163
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:54,348
- I know you.
- Come on. Come here.

164
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,301
I love you.

165
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,123
- See you in a few days.
- Okay.

166
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:04,748
I'll call you tonight.

167
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:16,460
Bye, Dad!

168
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:30,701
Leeds House, Atlanta, Georgia

169
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:52,677
Where's the dog?
No one heard barking.

170
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,818
There's nothing about it
in the case file.

171
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:02,825
The intruder enters in the dark
and cuts Charles Leeds' throat.

172
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,968
He shoots Valerie Leeds in
the stomach as she's rising...

173
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,366
disabling her but not killing her.

174
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:12,301
He leaves her
to watch her husband die...

175
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,142
then turns and goes down the hall.

176
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,166
The children were....

177
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:47,081
The children were still in bed
when they were shot...

178
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:50,119
which might indicate
that he used a silencer.

179
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,418
He dragged the bodies into
the master bedroom, but why?

180
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:05,543
They were already dead
and none of them got the same...

181
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:09,033
extra attention as Mrs. Leeds.

182
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,070
Small pieces of mirror
were inserted...

183
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,696
in the orbital sockets of the victims.

184
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,095
This occurred post-mortem.

185
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,749
Why did you put mirrors in their eyes?

186
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,484
The pieces of mirror are to make
their eyes look alive!

187
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:13,065
He wanted an audience.
He wanted them all lined up...

188
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:15,557
watching him when he touched her.

189
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,181
When he touched her.

190
00:21:22,768 --> 00:21:25,899
Touched. Talcum powder.

191
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,942
There was talcum powder.

192
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,288
"Mrs. Leeds had traces of
talcum on her right inner thigh.

193
00:21:34,352 --> 00:21:35,596
"A complete search of the home...

194
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:38,347
"led to no such matching talcum
in the house."

195
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:43,660
You took your gloves off,
didn't you? You son of a bitch!

196
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,535
You took your gloves off, touched her...

197
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,266
with your bare hand
and wiped her down.

198
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,953
But when the gloves were off,
did you open her eyes?

199
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:00,036
Crawford.

200
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,184
Are the Leeds' bodies
still at the morgue?

201
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,166
Who's good with latent prints here?

202
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,180
Atlanta P.D.

203
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,881
They've already printed the bodies.

204
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,156
Not the bodies.
Tell them to check the eyes.

205
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,743
Mrs. Leeds' eyes.
Even her corneas.

206
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:16,846
I think he took his gloves off.
I think he had to touch her.

207
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,990
Jesus, Will.

208
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,054
Gentlemen. Ladies.

209
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:24,427
This is what the subject's teeth
look like.

210
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:27,724
The impressions came from
bite marks on Mrs. Leeds.

211
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:30,795
This degree of crookedness...

212
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:33,899
plus the groove
in this central incisor...

213
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:35,948
makes his bite signature unique.

214
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:37,421
Fuckin' shark.

215
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,909
Knock it off!

216
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:43,086
We're grateful to have the FBI.

217
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:44,842
They have a lot of expertise
in this area.

218
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:46,919
In particular,
Investigator Graham does.

219
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,268
That right, Jack?

220
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,644
Yes, sir.

221
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,453
Anything you want to add,
Mr. Graham?

222
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,469
Why don't you come
on up to the front, please?

223
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,117
- That's the guy.
- Was he?

224
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:01,550
Yeah, that's the guy
who arrested Lecter.

225
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:03,142
I thought he retired.

226
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:06,029
The son of a bitch
just about gutted him.

227
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:14,383
Mrs. Leeds and Mrs. Jacobi
were the primary targets.

228
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:17,805
The others were killed
just to complete his fantasy.

229
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:21,002
I know that might be hard
to accept given what you saw...

230
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:23,014
but this was not random.

231
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,916
This wasn't some killing frenzy.
He was never out of control.

232
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:30,981
These attacks were organized,
the women carefully chosen.

233
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:33,575
We don't know
how he's choosing them, or why.

234
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,265
They lived in different states
and never met.

235
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:37,961
But there is some connection.

236
00:23:38,288 --> 00:23:41,321
There's some common factor,
and that's the key.

237
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,362
Find out what that is,
and we'll save lives.

238
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:47,628
'Cause this one
is gonna go on and on...

239
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,377
until we get smart or we get lucky.

240
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,414
He won't stop.

241
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,575
- Why not?
- Because it makes him God.

242
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,934
Would you give that up?

243
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:06,124
You asked about the dog.
Last night a vet called us.

244
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,873
Leeds and his oldest boy
brought the dog in...

245
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:10,602
the afternoon before they were killed.

246
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,036
Had a puncture wound to its abdomen.

247
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:14,795
The vet had to put it down.

248
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:17,100
Was it wearing a collar
with the address on it?

249
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,215
No.

250
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:22,158
- Did the Jacobis have a dog?
- No dog.

251
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:24,111
They found a litter box
in the basement...

252
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,477
cat droppings in it, no cat.

253
00:24:28,304 --> 00:24:31,784
If the cat was attacked,
the Jacobis may have buried it.

254
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:35,401
Ask Birmingham to check that backyard.

255
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:37,675
And tell them to use
a methane probe, it's faster.

256
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:44,777
Yeah. It's for you.

257
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:47,949
Crawford.

258
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,900
Carl, you're the light of my life.

259
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:55,589
Would it hold up in court?

260
00:24:55,823 --> 00:24:57,514
Okay. Great work.

261
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:02,829
They found a print on
Mrs. Leeds' eye. Partial thumb.

262
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,607
Besides that,
there's nothing else to tell you.

263
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,654
Thank you for your time.

264
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,353
I can't answer more questions.

265
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:11,463
Will Graham! Remember me?

266
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,037
Freddy Lounds. I covered
the Lecter case for the Tattler.

267
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:18,127
- Did the paperback.
- Yeah, I remember.

268
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,396
When did they bring you in?
What've you got?

269
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:24,109
You think the Tooth Fairy
will be bigger than Lecter?

270
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,445
I mean, he's already beaten
Lecter's score...

271
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,477
You write lying shit,
and the Tattler is an asswipe!

272
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:31,407
You stay away from me.

273
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:33,353
Get away, Lounds.

274
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,901
How about an exclusive?

275
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:41,161
Sorry about that.

276
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:44,297
That guy snuck into the hospital
and took those pictures of me.

277
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,472
Remember? With the tubes
hanging out of me?

278
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,821
Forget that prick.

279
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:49,573
Give yourself some credit.

280
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,306
When we catch the Tooth Fairy...

281
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,960
that print plus his teeth
will burn him.

282
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:55,790
You did that, Will.

283
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,830
That evidence was there, Jack.

284
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,117
- It was there for anyone to see.
- But nobody else did.

285
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:04,461
All I'm sayin' is,
that was very good work.

286
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,178
No, good work would be seeing it
all the way through...

287
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,686
and catching the guy.

288
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:12,047
And I can't do that.
I did what you asked me to do.

289
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:14,150
I'm going home.

290
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:18,056
I don't even have any idea
who this guy is.

291
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,422
What I just gave them was broad
strokes. He's got no face to me.

292
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,302
That's what you said about
Garrett Hobbs, remember?

293
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,855
- And you figured him out.
- No, I didn't.

294
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,578
- You didn't?
- No, I was stuck on Hobbs.

295
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:32,878
I had help.

296
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,607
From Lecter.

297
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:42,056
Yeah.

298
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,866
Jack, don't play games with me.
Don't do it.

299
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,683
Just tell me what's on your mind.

300
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:56,047
I'm saying maybe we've got
a resource we should look into.

301
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,541
Is that what this was about?

302
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,589
Did you just want to ask me that
all along?

303
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,835
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just doing my job.

304
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:04,205
If you know a better shortcut,
let me know it.

305
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:06,638
If you think there's any chance
he'll talk to me...

306
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:08,264
I'll go myself.

307
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,803
If you can't handle it,
God knows I'd understand that.

308
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,517
As a research subject, Lecter
has proven most disappointing.

309
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,236
He's simply impenetrable
to psychological testing.

310
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:30,983
Rorschach, Thematic Apperception.

311
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:33,199
He folds them into origami.

312
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:35,886
As you see.

313
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,244
So you can imagine the stir
your little visit...

314
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:41,254
is causing among my staff,
Mr. Graham.

315
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,875
If you'd care
to share some insights...

316
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:48,042
Dr. Chilton, I'm sorry, I've got
a 4:17 flight back to Atlanta.

317
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:49,421
Of course.

318
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,178
Tell me,
when you saw Lecter's murders...

319
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,840
their style, so to speak...

320
00:27:56,911 --> 00:28:00,228
were you able, perhaps,
to reconstruct his fantasies?

321
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,151
And, if so, did you jot down
any impressions?

322
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,262
No.

323
00:28:11,504 --> 00:28:13,228
Let me be frank, Mr. Graham.

324
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:17,484
The first analysis of Lecter
will be a publisher's wet dream.

325
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:20,072
I'd give you full credit, of course.

326
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:27,111
Damn it, man. You must have
some advice. You caught him.

327
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:28,744
What was your trick?

328
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,658
I let him kill me.

329
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:26,600
That's the same atrocious
aftershave you wore in court.

330
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,057
I keep getting it for Christmas.

331
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,153
Christmas, yes.
Did you get my card?

332
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:36,748
I got it, thank you.

333
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:40,044
So nice of the Bureau's
crime lab to forward that.

334
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:43,886
They wouldn't give me
your home address.

335
00:29:45,072 --> 00:29:47,658
Dr. Bloom sent me your article
on surgical addiction...

336
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,127
in the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry.

337
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:51,173
And?

338
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:54,503
Very interesting, even to a layman.

339
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,382
You say you're a layman.

340
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,109
But it was you who caught me.
Wasn't it, Will?

341
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:17,255
- Do you know how you did it?
- I got lucky.

342
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:20,396
I don't think you believe that.

343
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,662
It's in the transcript.
What does it matter now?

344
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,996
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

345
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,397
I need your advice, Dr. Lecter.

346
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:32,843
Birmingham and Atlanta.

347
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:36,586
You want to know how
he's choosing them, don't you?

348
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,502
I thought you'd have ideas.
I want you to tell me them.

349
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,877
Why should I?

350
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:42,285
There are things you don't have.

351
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:44,905
Research materials.
Maybe even computer access.

352
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:46,501
I'd speak to the Chief of Staff.

353
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,458
Yes, Dr. Chilton.

354
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:51,402
Gruesome, isn't he?

355
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:55,563
He fumbles at your head like
a freshman pulling at panties.

356
00:30:56,783 --> 00:30:58,344
If you recall, Will...

357
00:30:58,447 --> 00:31:00,782
our last collaboration
ended rather messily.

358
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,993
You'd get to see the file
on this case.

359
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:09,639
- And there's another reason.
- I'm all ears.

360
00:31:10,288 --> 00:31:12,589
I thought you might enjoy
the challenge.

361
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,502
Find out if you're smarter
than the person I'm looking for.

362
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:26,156
Then, by implication, you think
you're smarter than I am...

363
00:31:26,224 --> 00:31:28,296
since it was you who caught me.

364
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:30,220
I know I'm not smarter than you.

365
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,043
Then how did you catch me?

366
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,662
You had disadvantages.

367
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,715
What disadvantages?

368
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,662
You're insane.

369
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,800
You're very tanned, Will.

370
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:49,480
And your hands are so rough.
Not like a cop's hands anymore.

371
00:31:49,552 --> 00:31:52,552
And that shaving lotion is
something a child would select.

372
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:55,591
Has a little ship on the bottle,
does it not?

373
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,087
And how is young Josh
and the lovely Molly?

374
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:02,189
They're always in my thoughts,
you know.

375
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:04,197
You will not persuade me
with appeals...

376
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:05,679
to my intellectual vanity.

377
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:07,500
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.

378
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,323
You'll either do it or you won't.

379
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:11,563
- Is that the case file?
- Yes.

380
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,064
With photos?

381
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:15,241
Let me keep them,
and I might consider it.

382
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:16,301
No.

383
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:21,381
Do you dream much, Will?

384
00:32:21,488 --> 00:32:22,949
Goodbye, Dr. Lecter.

385
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,188
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet!

386
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:28,261
Give me the file, then!

387
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:32,046
And I'll tell you what I think.

388
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,911
I'll need one hour. And privacy.

389
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,644
Just like old times, Will?

390
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:16,556
This is a very shy boy, Will.

391
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:18,763
I'd love to meet him.

392
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,799
Have you considered
that he is disfigured...

393
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,912
or that he may believe
he is disfigured?

394
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:25,478
Yeah, the mirrors.

395
00:33:25,552 --> 00:33:27,439
Notice he smashes all the mirrors...

396
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:29,543
not just enough
to get the pieces he wants.

397
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:31,819
And, of course,
those shards in their eyes...

398
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,196
so he can see himself there.

399
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:34,473
That's interesting.

400
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,616
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

401
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:38,988
I had considered it.

402
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,160
- What about the women?
- Dead?

403
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,661
Mere puppets.

404
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,997
You need to see them living,
the way they caught his eye.

405
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,465
That's impossible.

406
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,226
Almost. Not quite.

407
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,871
What were the yards like?

408
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:57,734
Big backyards, fenced,
some hedges. Why?

409
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,589
Because if this pilgrim...

410
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,671
feels a special relationship
with the moon...

411
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:04,427
he might like to go outside and look at it.

412
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:06,350
You ever seen blood in the moonlight?

413
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:08,303
It appears quite black.

414
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:11,876
If one were nude, say,
it'd be better to have...

415
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:13,807
outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.

416
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,324
You think the yards are a factor
when he selects victims?

417
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:18,374
Yes.

418
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,061
And there will be more of them,
of course. Victims.

419
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:25,581
You'll be wanting lots
of these little chinwags...

420
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,305
- I take it.
- I might not have time.

421
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:28,586
I do.

422
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,278
I have oodles.

423
00:34:30,352 --> 00:34:32,294
I need your opinion now.

424
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,993
Then here's one:

425
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,327
You stink of fear
under that cheap lotion.

426
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,939
You stink of fear, Will,
but you're not a coward!

427
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,390
You fear me, but still you came here.

428
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:47,812
You fear this shy boy,
yet still you seek him out.

429
00:34:50,704 --> 00:34:52,776
Don't you understand, Will?

430
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:56,101
You caught me
because we're very much alike.

431
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,109
Without our imaginations...

432
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,901
we'd be like all those other
poor dullards.

433
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,095
Fear is the price of our instrument.

434
00:35:09,392 --> 00:35:10,853
But I can help you bear it.

435
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:23,911
- You getting his face?
- Yeah.

436
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,391
Okay, you got it?

437
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:27,302
All right,
let's get the fuck out of here.

438
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,578
Sure you're okay?

439
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,174
Yeah, I'm okay.

440
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,157
What do you think he
meant by "see them living"?

441
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:36,678
I don't know, maybe nothing.

442
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:39,020
It's hard to separate his bullshit.

443
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,641
But I'm gonna make another pass
at the Leeds' house.

444
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,996
All right, Duchess, doll.
That's it.

445
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:36,038
Show me what you can do.

446
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:41,352
Who's that? Get them, Duchess.
Get them, Duch! Go get them!

447
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:43,755
Go get them, girl!

448
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:44,878
Okay.

449
00:36:44,944 --> 00:36:46,220
And action!

450
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,142
Charles! What are you doing?

451
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,836
Hey, gang.

452
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:51,148
You crazy man.

453
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,157
How is everybody doing?

454
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:54,825
Just home from the store.

455
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:56,521
- Hi, Daddy.
- That's my girl.

456
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:58,828
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, honey. Billy?

457
00:36:58,928 --> 00:36:59,910
Hi, Dad.

458
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,413
And sweetie?

459
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,553
I am not ready for my close-up,
Mr. DeMille.

460
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,985
What do you think?

461
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:10,919
Get closer. Get closer.
Little closer.

462
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,185
I think we'd better put
these kids to bed early tonight.

463
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:16,622
They seem tired. Don't you think?

464
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:19,755
Here we are at the pool party.

465
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,547
What are you doing? Stop it!

466
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:23,720
You stop it! I'm telling my mother on you.

467
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,483
Now I get my kiss?

468
00:37:25,552 --> 00:37:29,513
- All right, you want a kiss?
- I want one. The romantic kind.

469
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,189
Jacobi House, Birmingham, Al

470
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,389
Won't nobody get in through here
again. I'll guaran-damn-tee it.

471
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:54,667
Why didn't he break in
down there? It's more hidden.

472
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:56,743
Hell, that door's got deadbolts.

473
00:37:56,848 --> 00:37:58,823
Reckon he was in too big a hurry.

474
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,184
No, this one doesn't hurry.

475
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:57,998
You sat right here, didn't you?

476
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:00,843
You watched the children bury the cat.

477
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:03,116
And then you waited for dark.

478
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:24,557
You're proud.
You had to sign your work.

479
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:02,439
Grandma? Grandma?

480
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:04,781
I'm sorry.

481
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,353
I've never seen a child
as dirty and disgusting as you.

482
00:40:09,424 --> 00:40:12,239
Look at you! You're soaking wet.
Get out of my bed.

483
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:14,508
- No.
- Go back to your room.

484
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,421
You're hurting me!

485
00:40:16,528 --> 00:40:18,699
Shut up, you filthy little beast!

486
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,833
I should have put you in
an orphanage, grandson or not.

487
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:25,516
Grandma, don't hurt me.

488
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:26,920
You're hurting me!

489
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,137
Into the bathroom!

490
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,884
Take off your nightshirt,
and wipe yourself off. Hurry up!

491
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,655
Now give me my scissors
from the medicine chest.

492
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,688
Please, no!

493
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:39,469
Take that filthy thing
in your hand. Stretch it out.

494
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:40,713
No, Grandma.

495
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:41,732
- Now!
- Please!

496
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,774
Look down. Do you want
me to cut it off? Do you?

497
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,156
No, Grandma!

498
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:47,979
I pledge you my word, Francis...

499
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,989
if you ever make
your bed dirty again...

500
00:40:50,063 --> 00:40:51,885
I'll cut it off.
Do you understand?

501
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:56,076
I'll be a good boy.
I promise.

502
00:42:47,728 --> 00:42:49,419
Good morning, Will.

503
00:42:49,552 --> 00:42:51,789
So nice of you to visit again.

504
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:56,622
He carved this on a tree
near the Jacobi house.

505
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,541
With a Buck knife.

506
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,615
The same one later used
on Charles Leeds.

507
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,894
Yes.

508
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,956
Take a walk with me.

509
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,311
He had a second tool, too.
A bolt cutter.

510
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,258
He used that to clear his view.

511
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,374
But?

512
00:43:14,608 --> 00:43:16,518
I don't think
that's what he brought it for.

513
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,563
It's too heavy. Too awkward.

514
00:43:19,952 --> 00:43:21,675
And he had to carry it a long way.

515
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:24,045
And what do we make of that symbol?

516
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:25,705
Asian Studies at Langley...

517
00:43:25,808 --> 00:43:27,979
identified it as a Chinese character.

518
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:30,510
It appears on a mah-jong piece.

519
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,641
- It marks the Red Dragon.
- Red Dragon. Correct.

520
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:36,397
This boy begins to interest me.

521
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:40,046
We don't know what greater
meaning the symbol might have...

522
00:43:40,112 --> 00:43:42,348
Do you like
my little exercise cage, Will?

523
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:45,230
My so-called lawyer
is always nagging Dr. Chilton...

524
00:43:45,328 --> 00:43:46,506
for better accommodations.

525
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,549
I don't know
which is the greater fool.

526
00:43:48,623 --> 00:43:50,827
Perhaps if you could offer
some insight into...

527
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,343
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"

528
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,861
Ever been a redbreast, Will?
Of course you have.

529
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:02,060
I'm allowed 30 minutes in here,
once a week.

530
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,884
Get to the point.

531
00:44:04,304 --> 00:44:06,857
He meant to use the bolt cutter
to enter the house...

532
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,975
but he didn't.

533
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,600
Instead he broke in
through the patio doors.

534
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,902
The noise woke Jacobi, and he
had to shoot him on the stairs.

535
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,887
That wasn't planned.
It was sloppy.

536
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:17,741
And that's not like him.

537
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:20,772
We mustn't judge too harshly, Will.

538
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,124
It was his first time.

539
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:26,117
Have you never felt
a sudden rush of panic?

540
00:44:31,344 --> 00:44:33,995
Yeah, that's the fear we talked about.

541
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:36,519
It takes experience to master it.

542
00:44:36,783 --> 00:44:38,278
You sensed who I was...

543
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:40,718
back when I was committing
what you call my "crimes."

544
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:41,798
Yes.

545
00:44:41,872 --> 00:44:44,141
So you were hurt not by a fault
in your perception...

546
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,255
or your instincts...

547
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,102
but because you failed to act
on them until it was too late.

548
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:52,232
- You could say that.
- But you're wiser now.

549
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,389
Imagine what you would do, Will,
if you could go back in time.

550
00:44:57,104 --> 00:45:00,519
Put two in your head before
you could palm that stiletto.

551
00:45:00,592 --> 00:45:02,185
Very good, Will.

552
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:05,325
You know,
I believe we're making progress.

553
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:07,759
And that's what our pilgrim is doing.

554
00:45:07,824 --> 00:45:09,646
He is refining his methods.

555
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:11,239
He is evolving.

556
00:45:14,288 --> 00:45:17,549
The case file mentioned videos
of the Leeds family.

557
00:45:17,872 --> 00:45:19,398
- I'd like to see those.
- No.

558
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:21,708
- Why not?
- It would be obscene.

559
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:25,676
You don't make it easy, do you?
Still, one aims to please.

560
00:45:26,384 --> 00:45:28,457
I'll call you
if I think of anything else.

561
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,081
Would you perhaps like
to leave me your home number?

562
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,156
- That's the end of our session.
- For now.

563
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:40,424
It was only his first time.

564
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:43,275
Already in Atlanta he did much better.

565
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:45,868
Rest assured, my dear Will...

566
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:48,073
this one will give you
plenty of exercise.

567
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,542
My love to Molly and Josh, goodbye.

568
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,487
Go to the back of the cell,
Dr. Lecter. Face the wall.

569
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:03,181
If you turn around
before the lock snaps...

570
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:04,294
you'll get a dart.

571
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,222
- Understood?
- Yes.

572
00:46:06,288 --> 00:46:09,157
You got ten minutes
to talk to your lawyer.

573
00:46:15,632 --> 00:46:18,283
- Starting now.
- Thanks so much, Barney.

574
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:25,642
Hello, Dr. Lecter?

575
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:28,686
I have those documents
you requested me...

576
00:46:36,048 --> 00:46:39,114
"Robes, Robespierre, Robin.

577
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:42,151
"Robin, call for....
Robin, fainting....

578
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:46,316
"Redbreast in a cage." 406.9.

579
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:54,030
"A robin redbreast in a cage
Puts all heaven in a rage"

580
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:55,175
Yes, that's it.

581
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,352
William Blake.
Auguries of Innocence.

582
00:46:57,424 --> 00:46:58,504
Think you got it?

583
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,917
Yeah, we should have.

584
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,602
We have some books
of Blake's paintings, too.

585
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:05,101
- Want to see them?
- Yeah. Thanks.

586
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,949
Psychology Department...

587
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,682
University of Chicago.
Dr. Bloom's office.

588
00:47:08,752 --> 00:47:11,654
Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine
and Edwards Publishing.

589
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,858
Dr. Bloom asked me to send
The Psychiatrist and the Law...

590
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,942
to Will Graham.

591
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:18,437
His assistant was
supposed to give me...

592
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:21,381
the address and phone number,
but, darn it, she never did.

593
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:24,138
I'm just a temp.
Linda will be in on Monday.

594
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,825
I have to catch FedEx
in about five minutes.

595
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,357
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom
about it...

596
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,188
because he told Linda to send it...

597
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:32,262
and I don't want
to get her into trouble.

598
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:35,018
It's right there in the Rolodex,
or whatever.

599
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,837
I'll dance at your wedding
if you read it to me.

600
00:47:37,904 --> 00:47:40,719
I don't know.
I'm really not supposed to.

601
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:42,988
Be a darling and flip
that old rascal...

602
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:44,746
I won't take up any more of your time.

603
00:47:44,848 --> 00:47:46,953
Graham, Will.

604
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:49,991
All right. Just a minute.

605
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:54,126
"Gibson, Gordon, Graham."

606
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:55,620
It doesn't give a home address.

607
00:47:55,728 --> 00:47:57,037
What does it have, dear?

608
00:47:57,104 --> 00:48:01,512
"FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue
Northwest, Washington, D.C."

609
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:03,406
- Yeah?
- And let's see.

610
00:48:04,368 --> 00:48:05,677
Here it is.

611
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:09,550
"P.O. Box 3680,
Marathon, Florida."

612
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:11,238
- Marathon.
- Yes.

613
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,794
That's fine. You're an angel.

614
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,622
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

615
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,655
I've come for the package of infrared.

616
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,662
Right. Put your back
against the door and come...

617
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,710
forward three steps till
you feel tile under your feet.

618
00:49:17,807 --> 00:49:20,044
And there's a stool just on the left.

619
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,543
Same Mr. D who's head
of Tech Services, am I right?

620
00:49:26,512 --> 00:49:28,137
I'm Reba McClane.

621
00:49:28,784 --> 00:49:31,948
Just a second more
and I will get you some light.

622
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,712
Okay, here we go.

623
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,438
So, what do you need the IR for?

624
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,185
It's for the zoo.

625
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:49,002
They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals.

626
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:53,327
That's great. I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.

627
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:57,991
This stuff is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean to handle.

628
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:03,343
But I guess
I don't need to tell you that.

629
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:14,439
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D.
Whoa!

630
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,487
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

631
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:18,664
No, Ralph.

632
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:21,031
It's starting to spritz outside.

633
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,119
I'll give you a lift home?

634
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:23,752
You ride a motorcycle.

635
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:25,963
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

636
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:28,585
I thought maybe
we'd stop off someplace...

637
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,629
have ourselves a little sundowner.

638
00:50:30,704 --> 00:50:33,421
- I've already got a ride.
- It's cool.

639
00:50:33,903 --> 00:50:37,199
That's cool. No problemo.

640
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:49,579
If there's anything I hate worse
than pity, it's fake pity.

641
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,941
Especially from a walking
hard-on like Ralph Mandy.

642
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,034
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.

643
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:31,333
Ride with me!

644
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:34,957
Thanks, but I take the bus
all the time.

645
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,815
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...

646
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:43,848
for my pleasure.

647
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:00,045
You want to come in?
I'll fix us a drink.

648
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,356
- Maybe another time.
- I will come in.

649
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,206
When is the zoo project?

650
00:52:19,855 --> 00:52:23,685
- Maybe next week. They'll call.
- I love zoos.

651
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:29,580
In fact one of my earliest
memories is seeing a cougar...

652
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:31,983
when I was about five.

653
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,014
I didn't lose my sight
till I was seven. Diphtheria.

654
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:37,292
Could you hand me that knife?

655
00:52:53,488 --> 00:52:57,743
I've always tried to hang on
to what that cougar looked like.

656
00:52:58,703 --> 00:53:02,478
But by now, to tell the truth,
what I see in my head...

657
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:04,616
is probably not in the least bit
like a cougar.

658
00:53:04,688 --> 00:53:06,760
It's more like a donkey or a goat.

659
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:09,515
You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him.

660
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:12,299
Maybe he's just
something I dreamed up.

661
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,716
You okay?

662
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,033
You don't say much, do you?

663
00:53:21,456 --> 00:53:23,049
No, I guess not.

664
00:53:25,904 --> 00:53:30,311
Let's talk about something
and get it out of the way, okay?

665
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:41,931
I can hear that you've had...

666
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,262
some kind of soft palate repair.

667
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,800
But I understand you fine
because you speak very well.

668
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:53,768
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's cool.

669
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,320
But I hope that you will, because...

670
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:00,550
I know what it's like
to have people...

671
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,176
always thinking that you're different.

672
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,047
That's good.

673
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:12,718
May I touch your face?

674
00:54:13,968 --> 00:54:16,837
I want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

675
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:20,239
I want to know whether I should
just shut up or not.

676
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,620
Take my word that I'm smiling.

677
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:38,052
I have to go.

678
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,200
If I offended you, I didn't mean to.

679
00:54:40,496 --> 00:54:41,423
No.

680
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,535
F.B.I. Headquarters,
Washington, D.C.

681
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:52,430
I don't know what they were like.

682
00:54:52,495 --> 00:54:55,048
It'd help if I could see
some of their personal effects.

683
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,803
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things?

684
00:54:57,903 --> 00:54:59,878
I sure do. I mean, other than...

685
00:54:59,984 --> 00:55:02,439
one or two little keepsakes
Niles Jacobi got.

686
00:55:03,855 --> 00:55:06,921
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?

687
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:10,220
Yes. As their executor, I keep
all that stuff in the office...

688
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:14,084
along with some of the smaller
valuables, till after probate.

689
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,940
But the Birmingham P.D.'s
been all through it.

690
00:55:17,008 --> 00:55:19,495
Could you pack those things
and ship them up to me?

691
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,407
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.

692
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:29,993
Hell...

693
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:33,768
probate judge is
an old golfing buddy of mine.

694
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,593
Son, just tell me you're
gonna nail that son of a bitch.

695
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,007
We're doing our best.

696
00:55:42,128 --> 00:55:44,168
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

697
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,109
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter.

698
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:48,841
Might've been mailed
by the Tooth Fairy.

699
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,405
He wants Lecter's approval.

700
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,684
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.

701
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:54,442
I've scrambled a chopper.

702
00:55:54,543 --> 00:55:55,820
Does Lecter know we have the note?

703
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:58,157
Not yet. It was found in
a routine cleanup.

704
00:55:58,256 --> 00:55:59,598
They don't open his mail?

705
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:01,288
Need a warrant.
X-rays only.

706
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,399
- Where's Lecter?
- The holding cage.

707
00:56:03,504 --> 00:56:04,878
Can he see his cell?

708
00:56:04,976 --> 00:56:07,365
No. But he's been there
almost half an hour.

709
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,000
He'll soon start to wonder
what's wrong.

710
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:11,078
We got to buy time, Jack.

711
00:56:14,064 --> 00:56:15,438
- Dr. Chilton.
- Yes?

712
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:17,096
Call your building superintendent...

713
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,596
or engineer, whoever's in charge.

714
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:21,421
Tell him to pull the circuit
breakers on Lecter's hall.

715
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:24,390
Have the super walk down
the hall past the cell...

716
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:25,444
carrying tools.

717
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,742
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off,
too busy to answer questions.

718
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:32,873
Don't touch the note, okay?

719
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:35,180
Graham's on his way.

720
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:39,050
Listen up! We've got a note
coming in on the fly...

721
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:43,013
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number One Priority.

722
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:45,893
It has to go back to
Lecter's cell within the hour...

723
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:47,244
unmarked.

724
00:56:47,568 --> 00:56:51,692
We'll need Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, then Documents.

725
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:55,210
I'll walk it through myself.
Let's go, people!

726
00:56:58,672 --> 00:57:01,541
My dear Dr. Lecter.
I wanted to tell you...

727
00:57:01,616 --> 00:57:02,564
I'm delighted...

728
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,615
that you've taken an interest in me.

729
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:08,812
And when I learned of your vast
correspondence, I thought:

730
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:12,107
"Dare I?" Of course I do.

731
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:16,365
I don't believe
you'll tell them who I am.

732
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:20,042
Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.

733
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:23,013
The important thing is
what I am becoming.

734
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:27,148
I know that you alone can
understand this transformation.

735
00:57:27,568 --> 00:57:30,382
I have some things
I'd love to show you.

736
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:33,860
If circumstances permit,
I hope we can correspond.

737
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:36,805
I have admired you for years
and have...

738
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,083
a complete collection
of your press notices.

739
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:42,118
Actually, I think of them
as unfair reviews.

740
00:57:42,863 --> 00:57:44,587
As unfair as mine.

741
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,776
They do like to sling demeaning
nicknames, don't they?

742
00:57:49,072 --> 00:57:52,421
"The Tooth Fairy." What could be
more inappropriate?

743
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:55,815
It would shame me for you to
read that, if I didn't know...

744
00:57:55,888 --> 00:57:58,539
you had suffered the same
distortions in the press.

745
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,128
I'm fed up with this
bloody stupid building!

746
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:02,541
Every day something breaking.

747
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:05,325
I swear they ought to tear
the whole fucking place down.

748
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:08,293
- How much longer do we have?
- Ten minutes, max.

749
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:10,091
Instructions for answering...

750
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:12,014
were probably in the section
Lecter tore out.

751
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:14,414
Why not just throw
the whole note away?

752
00:58:14,512 --> 00:58:16,105
It was full of compliments.

753
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:18,412
He couldn't bear to part with them.

754
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:24,108
Now we can mash just a little.

755
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:27,014
You're so sly.

756
00:58:28,816 --> 00:58:30,245
But so am I.

757
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:34,439
Aniline dyes and colored inks
are transparent to infrared.

758
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,544
These could be the tips of "T's"
here and here.

759
00:58:37,712 --> 00:58:40,461
On the end, that's a "P, " or possibly an "R."

760
00:58:40,528 --> 00:58:43,310
Maybe this is where he's telling
Lecter how to answer him.

761
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:45,612
There's only one way to carry on
a conversation...

762
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:46,661
that's one-way blind.

763
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,775
Publication. Wait a minute.

764
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:50,408
We know this guy reads the Tattler.

765
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:51,854
That's in his note, right?

766
00:58:51,952 --> 00:58:54,123
The Tooth Fairy, they made that up.

767
00:58:54,224 --> 00:58:56,460
Three "T's" and an "R"
in "Tattler."

768
00:58:56,976 --> 00:58:59,016
How do you communicate
through a tabloid?

769
00:58:59,088 --> 00:59:01,739
- You got what? News stories.
- Personals.

770
00:59:01,808 --> 00:59:04,525
Maybe he wants Lecter to answer
him through the personals?

771
00:59:04,623 --> 00:59:07,045
- That could be it.
- We need proofs of the pages...

772
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:08,580
before the next Tattler's published!

773
00:59:08,655 --> 00:59:09,637
I'm on it!

774
00:59:09,744 --> 00:59:12,045
Investigator Graham interests me.

775
00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:14,412
Not your standard gumshoe, is he?

776
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:15,461
More alert.

777
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:17,259
Purposeful looking.

778
00:59:17,712 --> 00:59:20,494
You should have taught him
not to meddle.

779
00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:22,665
Forgive the stationery.

780
00:59:22,736 --> 00:59:25,125
I chose it because
it'll dissolve very quickly...

781
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:27,686
if you should have to swallow it.

782
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:31,727
If I hear from you, next time
I might send you something wet.

783
00:59:34,127 --> 00:59:36,135
Until then, dear Doctor...

784
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,030
I remain your most...

785
00:59:38,192 --> 00:59:39,468
avid fan.

786
00:59:59,312 --> 01:00:01,548
The Tattler got an ad order
signed 666...

787
01:00:01,615 --> 01:00:03,503
Baltimore postmark on the envelope.

788
01:00:03,568 --> 01:00:05,390
It's set to run this afternoon.

789
01:00:05,455 --> 01:00:08,804
Chicago field office is sending
the text through now.

790
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:13,582
- "Dear Pilgrim."
- That's it.

791
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,849
Lecter called him a pilgrim
when we talked.

792
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:19,214
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful." Christ!

793
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:21,735
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.

794
01:00:21,808 --> 01:00:24,655
"Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...

795
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,278
"9:1, Luke 1:7."

796
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:28,009
- Code.
- Has to be.

797
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:34,446
We've got 19 minutes to get in
a message if we can break this.

798
01:00:34,544 --> 01:00:36,748
The Tattler can't hold
its presses any longer.

799
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:37,743
It's simple.

800
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:40,361
They only needed cover
against casual readers.

801
01:00:40,463 --> 01:00:42,187
- I'm thinking it's a book code.
- Code?

802
01:00:42,256 --> 01:00:43,500
The first numeral...

803
01:00:43,568 --> 01:00:44,997
"100 prayers," may be the page number.

804
01:00:45,104 --> 01:00:47,821
The numbers after could be
line and letter. But what book?

805
01:00:47,887 --> 01:00:50,059
- Bible?
- No, he's got "Galatians 15:2."

806
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,557
It has only six chapters.

807
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:53,704
Same with "Jonah 6:8."
It has four chapters.

808
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:55,237
He wasn't using a Bible.

809
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:57,864
Then the Tooth Fairy
named the book to use.

810
01:00:57,936 --> 01:01:00,751
He specified it in his note,
in the part Lecter tore out.

811
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:02,539
It would appear so.

812
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:05,541
What about sweating Lecter?
In a mental hospital...

813
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:07,078
- I would think drugs...
- No.

814
01:01:07,184 --> 01:01:10,119
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago, to find out...

815
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:11,816
where he buried the Princeton student.

816
01:01:11,887 --> 01:01:13,797
He gave them a recipe for dip.

817
01:01:13,904 --> 01:01:15,879
If we sweat him,
we lose the connection.

818
01:01:15,983 --> 01:01:17,805
If the Tooth Fairy picked the book...

819
01:01:17,903 --> 01:01:20,205
he knew Lecter would have it
in his cell.

820
01:01:20,304 --> 01:01:23,173
- Can we get a list of his books?
- From Chilton, maybe.

821
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:26,118
No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham,
when they tossed his cell...

822
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,006
took Polaroids so they could put
everything back in place.

823
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,690
Ask them to meet me with
pictures of his bookshelves!

824
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,450
- Where?
- The Library!

825
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:39,339
I'm leery of letting
Lecter's message run...

826
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:41,547
without knowing what it says.

827
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:45,291
I say let this one run.
We keep working on the code.

828
01:01:45,391 --> 01:01:48,042
At least it'll encourage
the Fairy to contact him again.

829
01:01:48,144 --> 01:01:50,827
What if it encourages him
to do something besides write?

830
01:01:50,895 --> 01:01:52,837
I don't like this any better than you.

831
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:55,718
But it's our best shot.

832
01:01:57,904 --> 01:02:00,108
National Tattler Building, Chicago, Il

833
01:02:15,407 --> 01:02:18,026
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

834
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,590
Oh, my God!

835
01:02:38,095 --> 01:02:38,826
Hello?

836
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:41,067
Jack, it's Lloyd Bowman.
I solved the code.

837
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,859
You need to know what it says
right now.

838
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:44,008
Okay, Lloyd.

839
01:02:44,112 --> 01:02:47,243
It says,
"Graham home, Marathon, Florida.

840
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:49,645
"Save yourself. Kill them all."

841
01:02:51,408 --> 01:02:53,863
- Yeah?
- Bowman just broke the code.

842
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:56,524
- What does it say?
- I'll tell you in a second.

843
01:02:56,624 --> 01:02:58,664
Now, listen to me. Everything is okay.

844
01:02:58,736 --> 01:03:01,453
I've taken care of it. Stay on
the phone when I tell you.

845
01:03:01,552 --> 01:03:02,500
Tell me now.

846
01:03:02,576 --> 01:03:04,267
Lecter gave the bastard
your home address.

847
01:03:04,336 --> 01:03:05,263
Wait.

848
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:33,287
Mom?

849
01:03:44,848 --> 01:03:46,855
Head down, ma'am.

850
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:13,321
Is he after you now?

851
01:04:13,424 --> 01:04:15,944
No, Lecter just suggested it to him.

852
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:20,300
I hate this, Molly.

853
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,413
I'm sorry.

854
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,695
- It's a sick feeling.
- I know it is.

855
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,303
But you'll be safe here.

856
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:30,091
Crawford's brother owns this place.

857
01:04:30,255 --> 01:04:32,197
No one in the world knows you're here.

858
01:04:32,304 --> 01:04:34,344
I'd just as soon
not talk about Crawford.

859
01:04:35,311 --> 01:04:39,021
- What are you using as bait?
- Sometimes I use worms.

860
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:40,646
You like those?

861
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:56,649
Beneath the yellow folder...

862
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:58,410
you'll find
your latest rejection slip...

863
01:04:58,512 --> 01:04:59,973
from the archives.

864
01:05:00,048 --> 01:05:03,463
It was brought to me by mistake
with some of my archives mail.

865
01:05:03,536 --> 01:05:06,219
I'm afraid I opened it
without looking.

866
01:05:06,543 --> 01:05:07,721
Sorry.

867
01:05:12,944 --> 01:05:16,522
I think we'll remove
Dr. Lecter's toilet seat.

868
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:41,068
Atlanta P.D. nailed him.

869
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:43,087
He had a fake Bureau ID...

870
01:05:43,184 --> 01:05:46,053
and was trying to get
the Leeds family autopsy photos.

871
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:50,375
It's a Federal beef, so Atlanta
kicked him back to us.

872
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:51,720
Personally...

873
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:54,213
I'd like nothing better
than to see the dirt sandwich...

874
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,011
pulling five at Leavenworth.

875
01:05:56,112 --> 01:05:58,959
But maybe there's a better way
to handle this.

876
01:05:59,024 --> 01:06:00,551
Yeah? What's that?

877
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,533
I think we ought to give him a story.

878
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,301
The Tooth Fairy's ugly...

879
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,531
and he's impotent with members
of the opposite sex.

880
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:11,917
Also, he sexually molests
his male victims.

881
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:13,710
While they're alive?

882
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:16,296
Sorry, I can't go into those details.

883
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,058
But we do also speculate...

884
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,615
that he's the product
of an incestuous home.

885
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:23,366
No wonder the creep's
such a loser, right?

886
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,073
That's a tip we got
from Dr. Lecter, by the way.

887
01:06:28,143 --> 01:06:31,373
So it's true that Lecter's
helping with your investigation?

888
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:33,835
Yes, it's true.

889
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:36,871
The Doctor was offended
a bottom-feeding lowlife like...

890
01:06:36,944 --> 01:06:39,758
the Tooth Fairy would consider
himself in the same league.

891
01:06:43,312 --> 01:06:46,246
Okay, tell me about this place you got here.

892
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:48,773
Will, your little Washington hideaway.

893
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,571
This is an apartment I'm borrowing...

894
01:06:50,671 --> 01:06:53,093
till this creep goes down in flames.

895
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:57,356
I keep copies of the evidence
so I can work on it at night.

896
01:06:57,424 --> 01:06:59,944
Make sure you can read the name
on that building.

897
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:01,128
Yeah.

898
01:07:03,184 --> 01:07:05,191
All right, I got enough.

899
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,098
Just remember, I scratch
your back, you scratch mine.

900
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,462
If my story draws the Fairy
in an attack on Graham...

901
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,494
and you nail the scumbag,
I get an exclusive.

902
01:07:16,112 --> 01:07:17,257
Fuck you, Lounds.

903
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,491
When we see the story,
we'll consider what to do...

904
01:07:20,592 --> 01:07:22,795
about your sealed indictment.

905
01:07:22,863 --> 01:07:27,271
All right, it was a pleasure
doing business with you, chumps.

906
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:38,188
I feel like I need a shower.

907
01:07:38,544 --> 01:07:40,267
You okay with this?

908
01:07:41,072 --> 01:07:43,657
Better he comes after me
than Molly and Josh.

909
01:07:43,952 --> 01:07:45,894
So, yeah, I'm okay with it.

910
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:47,461
I wish we had something better...

911
01:07:47,536 --> 01:07:49,991
but there's only ten days
till the next full moon.

912
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:52,268
We've got to rattle his cage.

913
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,531
We'll stake out this apartment,
put snipers on the rooftops.

914
01:07:55,632 --> 01:07:58,567
You'll have a moving box tail,
24/7, in your car...

915
01:07:58,672 --> 01:08:00,396
on the street, wherever you go.

916
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:03,759
You'll wear the Kevlar
at all times. No exceptions.

917
01:08:09,776 --> 01:08:10,791
You again?

918
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,054
Come back at 4:00 a.m.
when I open, all right?

919
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,134
Hey, I told you!

920
01:08:21,232 --> 01:08:22,344
What?

921
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,674
You told me what?

922
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:48,009
Fucking dickhead!

923
01:08:48,464 --> 01:08:51,147
Is that your fucking name on the sign?

924
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:46,510
Where am I?

925
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,788
What am I doing here?

926
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:54,214
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.

927
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:58,085
I haven't seen your face.

928
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:00,613
I couldn't possibly identify you.

929
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:04,072
I work for the National Tattler.

930
01:10:06,224 --> 01:10:08,395
It would pay...

931
01:10:10,703 --> 01:10:12,492
a big reward for me.

932
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,142
I mean, a half a million...

933
01:10:16,336 --> 01:10:18,474
or a million, maybe.

934
01:10:18,543 --> 01:10:21,096
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Lounds?

935
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,247
No.

936
01:10:22,864 --> 01:10:25,035
And I don't want to know.

937
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,410
You know, believe me.

938
01:10:26,512 --> 01:10:30,254
According to you,
I'm a vicious, perverted sexual failure...

939
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:32,809
a "bottom-feeding lowlife"...

940
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:34,734
who's about to
"go down in flames."

941
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,022
I think you know now, don't you?

942
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:42,215
Yes.

943
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,055
Do you understand
what I'm doing, Mr. Lounds?

944
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,262
No.

945
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:51,301
But I would like to.

946
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:53,612
I really want to understand...

947
01:10:54,255 --> 01:10:57,289
and then all my readers
could understand, too.

948
01:10:58,192 --> 01:10:59,785
I am not a man.

949
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:01,294
I began as one...

950
01:11:01,392 --> 01:11:04,174
but each being
that I change makes me...

951
01:11:04,272 --> 01:11:06,094
more than a man...

952
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,598
as you will witness.

953
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:09,769
I don't need to see you. No.

954
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,171
But you must, Mr. Lounds.

955
01:11:12,655 --> 01:11:14,062
You're a reporter.

956
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,982
You're here to report.

957
01:11:24,816 --> 01:11:26,726
Open your eyes and look at me.

958
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:27,847
No.

959
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:29,737
If you won't open them...

960
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,978
I'll staple your eyelids
to your forehead.

961
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,062
No!

962
01:11:33,712 --> 01:11:35,206
Open your eyes!

963
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,982
Oh, my dear God Jesus!

964
01:11:59,664 --> 01:12:00,908
Oh, God!

965
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,652
Do you want to know what I am?

966
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,211
More than anything.

967
01:12:19,632 --> 01:12:21,388
I was afraid to ask.

968
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,197
Do you see now?

969
01:12:33,264 --> 01:12:34,409
Yeah, I see.

970
01:12:34,512 --> 01:12:35,788
Oh, God.

971
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:38,507
Mrs. Jacobi in human form.

972
01:12:38,736 --> 01:12:40,427
- Do you see?
- Yes.

973
01:12:40,496 --> 01:12:42,536
Mrs. Leeds in human form.

974
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:44,232
- Do you see?
- Yes.

975
01:12:44,303 --> 01:12:46,670
- Mrs. Jacobi changing.
- Oh, my God.

976
01:12:47,216 --> 01:12:48,972
Mrs. Leeds changing.

977
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:50,734
Do you see?

978
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:53,131
Mrs. Jacobi reborn.

979
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,468
Do you see?

980
01:12:55,215 --> 01:12:57,354
Mrs. Leeds reborn.

981
01:12:58,064 --> 01:13:00,071
- Do you see?
- Please, no.

982
01:13:00,144 --> 01:13:01,932
No? No what?

983
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:03,689
Not me.

984
01:13:06,576 --> 01:13:09,227
Why did you write lies,
Mr. Lounds?

985
01:13:11,664 --> 01:13:13,452
Graham told me to lie.

986
01:13:15,344 --> 01:13:16,391
It wasn't me.

987
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:18,798
- Will you tell the truth now?
- Yes!

988
01:13:18,863 --> 01:13:20,172
About me?

989
01:13:20,816 --> 01:13:22,955
- My work?
- Oh, yes.

990
01:13:23,663 --> 01:13:25,070
My becoming?

991
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:26,344
Yeah.

992
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,073
I am the Dragon,
and you call me insane!

993
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:35,821
You are privy to a great becoming...

994
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,025
and you recognize nothing.

995
01:13:38,096 --> 01:13:40,878
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

996
01:13:42,032 --> 01:13:44,585
It is in your nature
to do one thing correctly.

997
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:47,209
Before me, you rightly tremble.

998
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:51,462
But fear is not what you owe me,
Mr. Lounds.

999
01:13:58,544 --> 01:14:00,748
You owe me awe.

1000
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:15,145
Read.

1001
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,872
That's all, Mr. Lounds.

1002
01:14:20,944 --> 01:14:22,635
You did very well.

1003
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:24,773
Will you let me go now?

1004
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:26,088
Soon.

1005
01:14:26,415 --> 01:14:30,060
There's one more way I can
help you to better understand.

1006
01:14:30,352 --> 01:14:32,327
I want to understand.

1007
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:35,594
I do.
And I'm really gonna be fair...

1008
01:14:36,112 --> 01:14:37,541
from now on.

1009
01:14:38,864 --> 01:14:40,325
You know that.

1010
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:47,976
Hello?

1011
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,822
Oh, God, no!

1012
01:15:18,192 --> 01:15:20,396
I have had a great privilege.

1013
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,693
I have seen with...

1014
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,307
wonder and awe the strength
of the Great Red Dragon.

1015
01:15:28,048 --> 01:15:31,277
He has helped me to understand
his splendor...

1016
01:15:31,343 --> 01:15:33,515
and now I want to serve him.

1017
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,898
He knows you made me lie, Will Graham.

1018
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,677
Because I was forced to lie...

1019
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:43,654
he will be more merciful to me
than to you.

1020
01:15:46,992 --> 01:15:48,137
Hello?

1021
01:15:48,879 --> 01:15:50,821
Oh, God, no!

1022
01:16:12,592 --> 01:16:15,177
We can let this tie us up in knots...

1023
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:17,351
or we can learn from it.

1024
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:21,066
Maybe even use it
to catch the bastard.

1025
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:29,030
He had to have a van or panel truck...

1026
01:16:29,103 --> 01:16:31,722
to move Lounds around
in that big old wheelchair.

1027
01:16:32,112 --> 01:16:33,039
Go on.

1028
01:16:33,104 --> 01:16:34,860
He had to already have
the wheelchair...

1029
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:36,421
or know where to get one fast.

1030
01:16:36,527 --> 01:16:39,113
It's an antique, not something
you'd find in the house.

1031
01:16:39,184 --> 01:16:42,697
Does it strike anybody
that he set this up in a hurry?

1032
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,101
The Tattler comes off the press
Monday night.

1033
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,549
By Tuesday morning he's
in Chicago, snatching Lounds.

1034
01:16:48,624 --> 01:16:50,511
He either lives in the Chicago area...

1035
01:16:50,608 --> 01:16:52,942
or he's within a driving radius of...

1036
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,382
call it six hours.

1037
01:16:54,863 --> 01:16:57,416
Find out in this area where
the Tattler was available...

1038
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,429
for early distribution Monday night.

1039
01:16:59,504 --> 01:17:01,260
Start with airports,
all-night newsstands.

1040
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,335
Maybe a newsie
remembers an odd customer.

1041
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,415
Lloyd, this cassette,
enhance the audio.

1042
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,138
Maybe you can pick up
something in the background.

1043
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,418
That wheelchair...

1044
01:17:09,519 --> 01:17:11,494
I want the maker, date,
possible sources.

1045
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,178
Graham and I will coordinate
from Chicago. Let's hustle.

1046
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:30,345
Look, there's not gonna be
any answers in Chicago, Jack.

1047
01:17:30,991 --> 01:17:33,893
Okay? I mean, Lounds, that was a bonus.

1048
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:38,798
That was a chance to show off.
It doesn't even fit his pattern.

1049
01:17:39,727 --> 01:17:42,597
The Leeds and the Jacobis
are what he needs.

1050
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:51,237
I think I should go back to Baltimore.

1051
01:17:51,312 --> 01:17:52,773
After what he tried to pull?

1052
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,109
Lecter picked up on something
in the missing part of the note.

1053
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:58,663
Not a name, but something,
enough to narrow the search.

1054
01:17:58,768 --> 01:18:00,459
Even if he did, he won't tell you.

1055
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,316
Not unless I can offer him something.

1056
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,003
Congratulations.

1057
01:18:05,072 --> 01:18:09,644
That was most artistic, the way
you disposed of Mr. Lounds.

1058
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:12,297
Your cell looks bigger
with no books in it.

1059
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,327
Does it?

1060
01:18:13,392 --> 01:18:14,952
I hadn't noticed.

1061
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:16,300
Oh, you will.

1062
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,309
I have other resources.

1063
01:18:19,632 --> 01:18:21,966
Tell me, Will. Did you enjoy it?

1064
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:24,618
Your first murder?

1065
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:27,086
Of course you did.
Why shouldn't it feel good?

1066
01:18:27,152 --> 01:18:28,679
It does to God.

1067
01:18:29,551 --> 01:18:32,617
Why, only last week in Texas,
he dropped a church roof...

1068
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,924
on the heads of 34 of his worshippers...

1069
01:18:34,992 --> 01:18:37,097
as they were groveling through a hymn.

1070
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,949
He wouldn't begrudge you
one journalist.

1071
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:41,701
Put me next to him, Doctor.

1072
01:18:41,808 --> 01:18:43,335
You and some SWAT team?

1073
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,895
Oh, Will.
Where's the fun in that?

1074
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:48,615
He'll have to take his chances, too.

1075
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:50,856
A roof can fall on anybody.

1076
01:18:52,304 --> 01:18:54,638
But not on Molly and Josh, I take it.

1077
01:18:54,704 --> 01:18:56,297
Not yet, anyway.

1078
01:18:56,943 --> 01:18:59,758
First he kills the pet,
then the family.

1079
01:19:00,623 --> 01:19:02,379
Freddy was your pet.

1080
01:19:02,799 --> 01:19:04,360
They're safe now.

1081
01:19:04,432 --> 01:19:06,668
No one will ever be safe
around you, Will.

1082
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,175
Clever work on his note, by the way.

1083
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,313
And that blackout was
an especially nice touch.

1084
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,895
What else was in that note, Doctor?

1085
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:31,499
Put me next to him!

1086
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:33,642
That's what you want, isn't it?

1087
01:19:33,712 --> 01:19:35,403
To help him succeed where you failed?

1088
01:19:35,472 --> 01:19:36,617
Twice?

1089
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,244
Give him a chance to kill me.

1090
01:19:40,304 --> 01:19:41,678
Go on, then.

1091
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:43,817
Seduce me with your wares.

1092
01:19:44,144 --> 01:19:46,445
Full restoration of your privileges.

1093
01:19:46,512 --> 01:19:49,261
Plus computer access
to the AMA archives.

1094
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,913
One hour a week
under supervision, of course...

1095
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:53,161
but it's a one-time offer.

1096
01:19:53,232 --> 01:19:55,566
It expires
the minute I walk out of here.

1097
01:19:55,632 --> 01:19:57,192
Bit measly, don't you think?

1098
01:19:57,263 --> 01:20:01,224
Turn it down, then. See what
terms you get from Chilton.

1099
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:02,949
Are these threats, William?

1100
01:20:03,023 --> 01:20:06,853
I'm waiting, Doctor. Or maybe
you've got nothing left to sell.

1101
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,390
A little sample, then. Why not?

1102
01:20:14,224 --> 01:20:16,111
- Seen the Blake, have you?
- Yes.

1103
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:18,117
No, you've looked but not seen.

1104
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:20,046
Transformation is the key.

1105
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:21,900
The man-dragon...

1106
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,455
his ugliness transformed by power.

1107
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:27,653
Look for a military record
with combat training.

1108
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,735
Look for extensive tattooing...

1109
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,979
and corrective surgery,
most likely to the face.

1110
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,428
Come on, I'm past that already
and you know it.

1111
01:20:35,792 --> 01:20:37,101
Give me what I need.

1112
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,694
How is he choosing the women?

1113
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:41,701
I've already suggested how.
The answer was in front of you.

1114
01:20:41,808 --> 01:20:44,874
- You looked but didn't see.
- Bullshit! No riddles!

1115
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,152
Just tell me.

1116
01:20:46,223 --> 01:20:47,172
No!

1117
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,295
It's your turn.

1118
01:20:48,368 --> 01:20:50,604
I asked you before
for a small courtesy...

1119
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:52,679
and you responded rudely.

1120
01:20:53,968 --> 01:20:55,626
Before I tell you anything more...

1121
01:20:55,727 --> 01:20:58,629
you will make
certain arrangements for me.

1122
01:20:58,928 --> 01:21:00,837
What kind of arrangements?

1123
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:02,538
Oh, nothing much.

1124
01:21:03,312 --> 01:21:05,581
Shall we say dinner and a show?

1125
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:11,977
You ready to tell me
what kind of outing this is?

1126
01:21:12,847 --> 01:21:13,992
Nope.

1127
01:21:15,152 --> 01:21:18,119
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you, D?

1128
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:19,944
Yep.

1129
01:21:21,903 --> 01:21:23,594
He's about six feet away.

1130
01:21:23,663 --> 01:21:25,256
Can you smell him?

1131
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:26,596
Yeah.

1132
01:21:26,672 --> 01:21:30,054
Now, he's a little noisy,
but he's sedated, I assure you.

1133
01:21:30,864 --> 01:21:33,319
Doctor Hassler's about to fix
his broken tooth.

1134
01:21:33,392 --> 01:21:35,017
Glad you could come,
Ms. McClane.

1135
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,640
We appreciate the infrared film,
by the way.

1136
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:39,238
Two more steps.

1137
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:42,923
I'll put your left hand
on the edge of the table.

1138
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,808
Now, he's right in front of you.

1139
01:21:45,872 --> 01:21:47,432
Take your time.

1140
01:21:54,512 --> 01:21:56,901
- D?
- I'm here.

1141
01:21:58,927 --> 01:22:00,356
You go ahead.

1142
01:22:43,503 --> 01:22:44,681
Here.

1143
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:48,869
Why don't you try this?

1144
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,818
Nine steps from the front door
to the clock...

1145
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,643
and three more to this room.

1146
01:23:38,992 --> 01:23:40,846
Sorry. Force of habit.

1147
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:50,124
That beautiful tiger,
this house, this music....

1148
01:23:50,928 --> 01:23:53,743
I don't think anybody knows you
at all, D.

1149
01:23:53,872 --> 01:23:55,977
Everybody wonders about you, though.

1150
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,868
Especially the women.

1151
01:23:58,608 --> 01:24:00,299
What do they want to know?

1152
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:01,960
They find you...

1153
01:24:02,032 --> 01:24:04,519
very mysterious and interesting.

1154
01:24:08,464 --> 01:24:10,668
Did they tell you how I look?

1155
01:24:10,959 --> 01:24:14,276
They said that you have
a remarkable body.

1156
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,041
That you're very sensitive about
your face but you shouldn't be.

1157
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,189
Oh, and...

1158
01:24:24,368 --> 01:24:26,277
they asked me if...

1159
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,546
you are as strong as you look.

1160
01:24:30,928 --> 01:24:32,237
And?

1161
01:24:33,616 --> 01:24:35,404
I said I didn't know.

1162
01:25:10,512 --> 01:25:12,584
Where the hell are you, D?

1163
01:25:18,255 --> 01:25:19,717
Here you are.

1164
01:25:24,175 --> 01:25:26,990
Do you want to know
what I think about it?

1165
01:25:48,496 --> 01:25:51,430
Now, would you show me
where the bathroom is?

1166
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:25,449
I have to do a little work.

1167
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,229
- If I'm keeping you from work...
- No.

1168
01:26:29,328 --> 01:26:31,630
- ...I'll go.
- I want you to be here.

1169
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,604
I do. It's just a tape
I need to watch.

1170
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:37,131
It won't take long.

1171
01:26:44,815 --> 01:26:47,849
- Do you need to hear it, too?
- No.

1172
01:26:47,952 --> 01:26:49,774
May I keep the music?

1173
01:27:48,975 --> 01:27:50,568
What's it about?

1174
01:27:52,336 --> 01:27:54,572
Some people I'm going to meet.

1175
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:06,157
So then...

1176
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:12,424
it's what? It's a corporate promo?
Some kind of homework?

1177
01:28:14,799 --> 01:28:17,865
It's homework. Yeah.

1178
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:24,971
That's a good idea.

1179
01:28:26,767 --> 01:28:29,156
It's so important to be prepared.

1180
01:28:34,959 --> 01:28:37,807
My God, are you ever!

1181
01:30:08,175 --> 01:30:10,925
No. I won't give her to you. No.

1182
01:30:21,488 --> 01:30:25,165
Please, just for a little while.

1183
01:30:32,496 --> 01:30:34,405
No! You're hurting me!

1184
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:56,521
No...

1185
01:30:57,712 --> 01:30:59,086
she's nice.

1186
01:31:00,496 --> 01:31:01,837
She's okay.

1187
01:31:45,391 --> 01:31:48,620
I had a really terrific time
last night.

1188
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:52,300
But this morning you seem
like a different person.

1189
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,178
- Is something wrong?
- I have to go now.

1190
01:31:57,007 --> 01:31:59,080
- I have to go away.
- Where?

1191
01:32:00,143 --> 01:32:01,485
On a trip.

1192
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:10,313
- When will I see you again?
- Reba, you have to get out. Now.

1193
01:32:14,703 --> 01:32:16,526
Dear Mr. Graham.

1194
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,036
Here are the Jacobis'
personal effects, as discussed.

1195
01:32:20,112 --> 01:32:22,119
I hope these things might help you.

1196
01:32:22,192 --> 01:32:24,363
Good hunting. Byron Metcalf.

1197
01:32:43,312 --> 01:32:45,897
How many more
times are we going to watch this?

1198
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,196
"See them living, " he said,
"right in front of you."

1199
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:51,238
It's something about
these home movies.

1200
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:54,029
Lecter keeps saying,
"You looked, but didn't see."

1201
01:32:54,128 --> 01:32:56,266
Lecter says a lot of things.

1202
01:32:58,928 --> 01:33:01,710
Sad damn thing.
But we already knew that.

1203
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:05,003
We can't afford
to let Lecter waste our...

1204
01:33:05,071 --> 01:33:06,380
No. Again.

1205
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:17,674
Your dissertation must be
nearly finished, Mr. Crane.

1206
01:33:17,744 --> 01:33:18,693
Nearly.

1207
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,517
It's nice to be able to connect
a face with a name...

1208
01:33:21,584 --> 01:33:23,494
after all our correspondence.

1209
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,429
But, you know, you don't look
like I imagined you looked.

1210
01:33:28,688 --> 01:33:30,662
What did you think I looked like?

1211
01:33:31,343 --> 01:33:32,521
Different.

1212
01:33:43,471 --> 01:33:44,682
Thank you.

1213
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,803
Right there! There.

1214
01:33:50,064 --> 01:33:52,235
That's what he wanted
the bolt cutter for.

1215
01:33:52,304 --> 01:33:55,599
To cut that padlock
and go in through the basement.

1216
01:33:56,207 --> 01:33:58,346
But that's a different door.

1217
01:33:59,152 --> 01:34:02,949
I don't get it. The one I saw
was flush steel with deadbolts.

1218
01:34:03,952 --> 01:34:07,661
Jacobi had a new door installed.
Beginning of January, I think.

1219
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,189
It's in here somewhere.

1220
01:34:09,968 --> 01:34:12,717
Think he cased the house
with the old door?

1221
01:34:12,783 --> 01:34:14,474
He brought the bolt cutter, didn't he?

1222
01:34:14,543 --> 01:34:15,852
He was sure he'd need it.

1223
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,375
Why case it two months
in advance and not check it?

1224
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,782
I don't know. He was ready
with the bolt cutter...

1225
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,221
like at the Leeds' house.

1226
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,881
There he was ready
with a glass cutter.

1227
01:34:23,952 --> 01:34:27,334
He must've seen the glass when
he walked in the neighborhood.

1228
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,512
No. You can't see
that door from the yard.

1229
01:34:29,584 --> 01:34:32,137
There's a porch lattice in the way.

1230
01:34:33,232 --> 01:34:35,916
Jack, he knew
the inside of the houses.

1231
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,388
Remarkable, isn't it?

1232
01:34:50,608 --> 01:34:52,430
Two hundred years old.

1233
01:34:54,448 --> 01:34:55,877
Yet so fresh.

1234
01:34:56,783 --> 01:34:58,060
So vivid.

1235
01:35:32,752 --> 01:35:35,174
He almost looks alive, doesn't he?

1236
01:36:20,336 --> 01:36:23,303
We've just gotten
a report here from the....

1237
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,134
Do you still have
the Jacobis' check stubs...

1238
01:36:37,231 --> 01:36:38,508
and credit card statements?

1239
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,421
We're looking for any kind
of service call or purchase...

1240
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,862
that might've required a stranger...

1241
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,236
to enter the house.

1242
01:36:44,303 --> 01:36:47,151
- A repairman, delivery guy.
- Anybody in the house.

1243
01:36:47,216 --> 01:36:48,874
- Yeah.
- We checked.

1244
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:50,351
I know we checked that...

1245
01:36:50,415 --> 01:36:52,903
but now we got to go back
to before January.

1246
01:36:52,976 --> 01:36:54,798
- Last year's purchase orders.
- Yeah.

1247
01:36:54,863 --> 01:36:57,351
- No collar.
- But please hurry. It's urgent.

1248
01:36:57,424 --> 01:36:58,634
No collar.

1249
01:36:58,703 --> 01:37:00,427
- Metcalf says...
- No collar.

1250
01:37:00,496 --> 01:37:03,343
The dog had no collar
in a neighborhood of dogs...

1251
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:04,651
but he knew which was theirs.

1252
01:37:04,752 --> 01:37:08,014
Same with the Jacobis' cat.
No collar, but he knew.

1253
01:37:08,976 --> 01:37:12,009
He knew about the padlock.
He knew about the pane of glass.

1254
01:37:12,112 --> 01:37:14,217
He knew the layout.
He knew how to get in.

1255
01:37:14,288 --> 01:37:17,637
Every goddamn thing he needed
to know was on this....

1256
01:37:18,063 --> 01:37:19,373
Oh, Jesus.

1257
01:37:21,552 --> 01:37:24,202
Is Metcalf still on the phone?
Give it!

1258
01:37:24,623 --> 01:37:26,184
Byron, it's Graham.

1259
01:37:26,416 --> 01:37:30,028
You said Niles Jacobi took a few
keepsakes. Do you have a list?

1260
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:31,208
Yeah, right here.

1261
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:34,890
I need to know if something
he took was a home video.

1262
01:37:34,992 --> 01:37:37,642
A full-length VHS tape,
compiled from shorter tapes.

1263
01:37:37,744 --> 01:37:39,784
- I see one videotape.
- Yes?

1264
01:37:43,056 --> 01:37:45,390
But it says, "Meet the Jacobis."

1265
01:37:47,472 --> 01:37:48,966
It's Chromalux.

1266
01:37:51,344 --> 01:37:52,970
We just got a fax.

1267
01:37:53,071 --> 01:37:55,493
An incident at the Brooklyn Museum.

1268
01:37:55,568 --> 01:37:58,437
A guy attacked two employees,
and get this...

1269
01:37:59,152 --> 01:38:01,006
ate the Blake painting.

1270
01:38:01,103 --> 01:38:02,216
What?

1271
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:05,547
That's him. It's got to be.

1272
01:38:05,903 --> 01:38:08,751
If that painting meant so much
to him, why destroy it?

1273
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:11,369
And why didn't he kill
those two women at the museum?

1274
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,163
They both got a good look at him.

1275
01:38:16,176 --> 01:38:17,517
Maybe he's trying to stop.

1276
01:39:31,087 --> 01:39:33,291
Mr. Crawford,
all you've got is a hunch.

1277
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,208
I've got 382 employees,
and they've got a union.

1278
01:39:36,272 --> 01:39:38,344
I can't just turn you loose
on their files.

1279
01:39:38,448 --> 01:39:39,877
Not without a court order.

1280
01:39:39,952 --> 01:39:42,439
There are privacy issues.
The company's exposure.

1281
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:44,878
One of the employees
has already killed 11 people...

1282
01:39:44,976 --> 01:39:45,991
that we know of.

1283
01:39:46,095 --> 01:39:47,470
If he gets away tonight...

1284
01:39:47,567 --> 01:39:49,062
what's the company's exposure on that?

1285
01:39:49,168 --> 01:39:52,332
- I'll get our lawyers here...
- We don't have time for that.

1286
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,349
Listen!

1287
01:39:53,456 --> 01:39:55,911
We're looking for a white male,
25 to 35...

1288
01:39:56,016 --> 01:39:57,674
- right-handed with brown hair.
- No...

1289
01:39:57,775 --> 01:40:01,321
Listen! Please. He's strong.
He's possibly a bodybuilder.

1290
01:40:01,392 --> 01:40:04,174
He might have some kind
of facial disfigurement.

1291
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,628
He drives a van or a panel truck.

1292
01:40:07,248 --> 01:40:08,590
That sounds like Mr. D.

1293
01:40:08,687 --> 01:40:09,800
Oh, my God.

1294
01:40:09,872 --> 01:40:11,246
Who's Mr. D?

1295
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:13,700
Francis Dolarhyde,
Manager of Technical Services.

1296
01:40:13,808 --> 01:40:15,084
What does he do exactly?

1297
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:17,355
He maintains the equipment
for tape transfers.

1298
01:40:17,456 --> 01:40:19,561
Would he have access
to people's home videotapes?

1299
01:40:19,632 --> 01:40:22,185
He has access to every tape
that comes through here.

1300
01:40:24,112 --> 01:40:26,599
Thanks for dinner,
and thanks for letting me vent.

1301
01:40:26,671 --> 01:40:28,362
Look, no problemo.

1302
01:40:30,384 --> 01:40:34,028
Reba, listen, I know it's not
my place to say this....

1303
01:40:35,728 --> 01:40:36,676
Go on.

1304
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:40,364
Well, if Dolarhyde is really
as moody as you say he is...

1305
01:40:41,104 --> 01:40:42,762
maybe you ought to keep some distance.

1306
01:40:42,832 --> 01:40:45,385
I mean, what do you really know
about the guy?

1307
01:40:45,808 --> 01:40:48,077
I appreciate
your concern, Ralph. Really.

1308
01:40:48,143 --> 01:40:51,307
And I promise
I'll give it some thought.

1309
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:56,135
- Hey, have a great vacation.
- Thanks.

1310
01:40:56,624 --> 01:40:59,013
- See you in a week.
- Good night.

1311
01:41:11,887 --> 01:41:13,742
- I had a great time.
- Good night.

1312
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,182
Good night!

1313
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,829
Ralph, just 'cause
I'm feeling vulnerable...

1314
01:42:06,544 --> 01:42:07,788
Wake up.

1315
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:13,739
You wandered around in the house
while I was asleep, didn't you?

1316
01:42:13,839 --> 01:42:14,788
What?

1317
01:42:14,864 --> 01:42:17,733
The other night,
did you find something odd?

1318
01:42:19,184 --> 01:42:22,796
Did you take it and show it
to somebody? Did you do that?

1319
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,262
D? What is it?

1320
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,145
What's happening?

1321
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,473
- Sit still or he'll hear us!
- Who will?

1322
01:42:30,544 --> 01:42:32,071
He's upstairs.

1323
01:42:35,152 --> 01:42:36,876
He wants you, Reba.

1324
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,381
I thought he was gone,
but now he's back.

1325
01:42:41,456 --> 01:42:43,245
D, you're scaring me.

1326
01:42:45,967 --> 01:42:48,356
I didn't want to give you to him.

1327
01:42:48,751 --> 01:42:52,047
I did a thing for you today
so he couldn't have you.

1328
01:42:53,103 --> 01:42:54,510
I was wrong.

1329
01:42:55,856 --> 01:42:59,336
You made me weak and then you hurt me.

1330
01:43:20,335 --> 01:43:21,383
No.

1331
01:43:22,607 --> 01:43:24,680
No, you can't have her!

1332
01:43:25,456 --> 01:43:27,660
Please don't let him have me.

1333
01:43:28,432 --> 01:43:29,741
You won't.

1334
01:43:30,448 --> 01:43:31,854
I'm for you.

1335
01:43:32,368 --> 01:43:35,564
You like me. I know you like me.
Take me with you.

1336
01:43:38,096 --> 01:43:41,641
Take you with me?
Yes. Put out your hand.

1337
01:43:41,776 --> 01:43:44,143
Feel this. That's a shotgun.

1338
01:43:44,272 --> 01:43:47,207
A 12-gauge magnum.
Do you know what it'll do?

1339
01:43:48,112 --> 01:43:51,560
I wish I could have trusted you.
I wanted to trust you.

1340
01:43:52,848 --> 01:43:55,182
You felt so good!

1341
01:43:55,888 --> 01:43:57,295
So did you.

1342
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:03,211
- Please don't hurt me now.
- It's all over for me.

1343
01:44:12,656 --> 01:44:16,071
- Where are you?
- I can't leave you to him.

1344
01:44:16,144 --> 01:44:18,926
Do you know what he'll do?
He'll bite you to death.

1345
01:44:19,024 --> 01:44:22,734
He'll hurt you so bad!
I can't let that happen.

1346
01:44:23,248 --> 01:44:27,077
- It's better if you go with me.
- Yes, God, get us out of here!

1347
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:31,022
- I'll shoot you and then myself.
- Oh, no.

1348
01:44:31,088 --> 01:44:33,324
- I have to shoot you.
- No....

1349
01:44:40,304 --> 01:44:41,766
I can't do it.

1350
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,189
D!

1351
01:45:12,112 --> 01:45:13,705
Three steps to the clock.

1352
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,196
From the clock to the door, nine more.

1353
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,443
Oh, God.

1354
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,960
What is that?
What the hell is that?

1355
01:45:26,256 --> 01:45:27,881
That's the place.

1356
01:45:27,952 --> 01:45:29,294
Goddamn it!

1357
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,400
All units,
that's his house that's burning.

1358
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,353
FBI!

1359
01:45:49,648 --> 01:45:52,365
Francis Dolarhyde! Where is he?

1360
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,759
He's in there. He is dead.

1361
01:45:54,991 --> 01:45:56,136
You know that?

1362
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,695
He shot himself in the face.
I put my hand in it.

1363
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,800
He set fire to the house.
He was on the floor, and I...

1364
01:46:18,864 --> 01:46:20,140
You all right?

1365
01:46:32,464 --> 01:46:34,122
That's all I need.

1366
01:46:34,192 --> 01:46:36,102
I'd like to come back
before I leave town.

1367
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:38,663
- See how you're doing.
- Sure, why not?

1368
01:46:38,832 --> 01:46:41,320
Who could resist a charmer like me?

1369
01:46:43,343 --> 01:46:47,020
You know, whatever part of him
was still human...

1370
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,575
was only kept alive because of you.

1371
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:51,497
You probably saved some lives.

1372
01:46:53,072 --> 01:46:55,177
You didn't draw a freak. Okay?

1373
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,549
You drew a man
with a freak on his back.

1374
01:47:00,015 --> 01:47:01,771
I should have known.

1375
01:47:01,872 --> 01:47:06,476
No, sometimes you don't.
Trust me, I've been there.

1376
01:47:09,392 --> 01:47:12,708
Listen to me. There was
plenty wrong with Dolarhyde...

1377
01:47:12,784 --> 01:47:14,507
but there's nothing wrong with you.

1378
01:47:16,432 --> 01:47:17,610
Except your hair.

1379
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,061
Your hair is a train wreck.

1380
01:47:21,135 --> 01:47:22,990
Can we please do something about that?

1381
01:47:23,055 --> 01:47:25,227
For next time, maybe? Please?

1382
01:47:26,864 --> 01:47:28,293
That would be nice.

1383
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,637
- Thank you.
- Just get some rest.

1384
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,588
You're gonna be fine.

1385
01:47:38,575 --> 01:47:41,096
Dr. Voss,
please call Pharmacy 4421.

1386
01:47:43,184 --> 01:47:45,126
We found this in his safe.

1387
01:47:45,232 --> 01:47:47,207
Thought you might
want to take the first look.

1388
01:47:47,311 --> 01:47:48,620
You've earned it.

1389
01:48:17,872 --> 01:48:20,523
When I read his journal, it was sad.

1390
01:48:21,552 --> 01:48:23,308
It was just so sad.

1391
01:48:25,296 --> 01:48:27,947
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.

1392
01:48:29,903 --> 01:48:32,521
He wasn't born a monster.

1393
01:48:32,687 --> 01:48:36,168
This guy was made one
through years of abuse.

1394
01:48:36,464 --> 01:48:38,984
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad, can we make s'mores?

1395
01:48:39,344 --> 01:48:41,286
- S'mores?
- Yeah, s'mores.

1396
01:48:41,775 --> 01:48:43,717
- Yeah, you're on.
- All right.

1397
01:48:43,824 --> 01:48:45,766
- Go look in the pantry.
- Okay.

1398
01:48:54,255 --> 01:48:55,237
Crawford.

1399
01:48:55,344 --> 01:48:57,253
Those remains you found in the rubble.

1400
01:48:57,328 --> 01:49:00,045
- They're not Dolarhyde's.
- What are you talking about?

1401
01:49:00,464 --> 01:49:03,115
- His damn dentures were there.
- But not his bones.

1402
01:49:03,184 --> 01:49:04,394
Wrong DNA.

1403
01:49:04,463 --> 01:49:05,740
Then whose are they?

1404
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,662
Saint Louis P.D.
is looking for...

1405
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,647
a Chromalux employee
named Ralph Mandy.

1406
01:49:09,712 --> 01:49:12,876
He should be on vacation,
so nobody missed him for a week.

1407
01:49:14,223 --> 01:49:16,679
- What is taking him so long?
- Are you kidding?

1408
01:49:16,752 --> 01:49:19,981
It takes him 20 minutes to get
out of bed in the morning.

1409
01:49:20,079 --> 01:49:23,243
Yeah, but now I have
a serious marshmallow jones.

1410
01:49:31,503 --> 01:49:33,511
Josh, what are you doing?

1411
01:49:45,264 --> 01:49:48,297
We can't come to the
phone. You know the deal.

1412
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,091
Wait for the beep.

1413
01:49:51,632 --> 01:49:55,177
It's Jack.
It's Dolarhyde. He's still alive.

1414
01:49:55,664 --> 01:49:57,900
I'm scrambling everything
that rolls or flies...

1415
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,625
but they'll take time to arrive.

1416
01:50:00,336 --> 01:50:01,351
Will?

1417
01:50:02,415 --> 01:50:04,303
Christ, Will, where are you?

1418
01:50:59,407 --> 01:51:02,189
Drop it. Do it now, gumshoe.

1419
01:51:06,991 --> 01:51:09,163
Your son is about to change.

1420
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,814
Then your wife.

1421
01:51:12,784 --> 01:51:14,278
You can watch.

1422
01:51:15,088 --> 01:51:16,910
Then I'll take care of you.

1423
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:21,327
Look at you.

1424
01:51:21,647 --> 01:51:25,542
I've never seen
a child as disgusting as you!

1425
01:51:25,808 --> 01:51:28,295
You pissed your pants?
How dare you!

1426
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,356
You dirty little beast.
You want me to cut it off?

1427
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,949
Want me to do that, you little freak?

1428
01:51:36,016 --> 01:51:37,226
You want me to cut it off?

1429
01:51:37,296 --> 01:51:40,591
Do you? Don't cry at me,
you little faggot!

1430
01:51:41,136 --> 01:51:45,413
Apologize! Say, "I'm sorry,
Daddy! I'm a dirty little beast.

1431
01:51:46,095 --> 01:51:48,135
"I'm a freak." Say it!

1432
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,352
- No.
- Say it!

1433
01:51:49,424 --> 01:51:51,846
- Dad!
- Say it, or I will cut it off!

1434
01:51:51,984 --> 01:51:54,537
"I'm a dirty little beast.

1435
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,462
"Freak! Harelip!

1436
01:51:56,559 --> 01:51:58,698
"And no one will ever love me."

1437
01:52:00,495 --> 01:52:02,186
Josh, run! Run!

1438
01:52:11,215 --> 01:52:12,492
Get down!

1439
01:52:14,384 --> 01:52:15,661
You okay?

1440
01:52:31,823 --> 01:52:33,765
- Josh?
- Mom?

1441
01:52:34,192 --> 01:52:35,305
Will?

1442
01:52:36,752 --> 01:52:38,475
Where are you guys?

1443
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,255
I thought I heard some kind of....

1444
01:52:44,176 --> 01:52:45,288
Will?

1445
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,753
Molly, get down!

1446
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:02,312
Will!

1447
01:53:14,575 --> 01:53:15,852
Shoot....

1448
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,574
What?

1449
01:53:18,672 --> 01:53:20,494
Shoot him. Shoot him.

1450
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:38,504
Mommy?

1451
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:54,029
My dear Will.
You must be healed by now.

1452
01:53:54,704 --> 01:53:56,711
On the outside, at least.

1453
01:53:56,815 --> 01:53:58,954
I hope you're not too ugly.

1454
01:53:59,056 --> 01:54:01,576
What a collection of scars you have!

1455
01:54:01,711 --> 01:54:03,850
Never forget
who gave you the best of them.

1456
01:54:03,952 --> 01:54:05,293
And be grateful.

1457
01:54:05,392 --> 01:54:09,189
Our scars have the power
to remind us the past was real.

1458
01:54:10,032 --> 01:54:12,399
We live in a primitive time,
don't we, Will?

1459
01:54:12,464 --> 01:54:14,504
Neither savage nor wise.

1460
01:54:14,576 --> 01:54:16,136
Half measures are the curse of it.

1461
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,328
A rational society would either
kill me or put me to some use.

1462
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,767
Do you dream much, Will?
I think of you often.

1463
01:54:26,896 --> 01:54:29,547
Your old friend, Hannibal Lecter.

1464
01:54:47,824 --> 01:54:49,929
Hannibal?
There's someone here to see you.

1465
01:54:50,223 --> 01:54:53,420
Wants to ask a few questions.
I said you'd probably refuse.

1466
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,931
A young woman.
Says she's from the FBI.

1467
01:54:58,032 --> 01:55:00,901
Though she's far too pretty,
if you ask me.

1468
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,232
I'll tell her you said no.

1469
01:55:09,584 --> 01:55:11,209
What is her name?
