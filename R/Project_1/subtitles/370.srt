WARDEN: James McCullen,
you Scottish pig,

5
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,253
you've been found guilty of treason
for the sale of military arms

6
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,539
to the enemies of our Lord,
King Louis XIII,

7
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,634
even whilst you sold arms
to our Lord himself.

8
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,510
Your king is a vile bag of filth
who murders his own allies.

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,180
(GROWLS) I should have
charged him double.

10
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:39,181
You tried to overthrow the Crown
in conspiracy with its enemies.

11
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,516
Unlike your simpleton king,
his enemies know

12
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,983
that it is the true McCullen destiny
not simply to supply arms,

13
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,685
but to run the wars!

14
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,526
Do you have anything else to say
before the sentence is carried out?

15
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,112
Yes, I do.

16
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,567
Clan McCullen is far greater
and more powerful

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,777
than any of you could ever imagine.

18
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,828
My sons will continue to rise
long after I am gone,

19
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,294
as will their sons

20
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,213
and, God willing, their sons.

21

We're going to make an example of you!

24
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:23,268
So that no man, woman nor child may
ever see your treacherous face again,

25
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,729
you shall wear this mask
for the term of your natural life.

the greatest creators of weaponry
in the world.

29
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,839
But perhaps in this century,
I'll outdo them all.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

35
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,561
we discovered how to programme them
to do almost anything.

36
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,267
For example, eat metal.

37
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:15,444
Watch this test
of the world's first nanomite warhead.

38
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,162
Each of these warheads
contains 7 million nanomites

39
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,292
and has the ability to eat anything
from a single tank

40
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,909
to an entire city.

41
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,629
As you can see, it quickly converts
to eating any and all material in its path.

42
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,127
Once unleashed,
the nanomites will not stop, ever.

43
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,968
Once the target has been destroyed,

44
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,853
the launcher triggers
a kill switch unique to each warhead

45
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,271
that short-circuits the nanomites,
preventing any unwanted destruction.

00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,466
Put down that weapons case, son,
and let us deliver those warheads.

172
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,303
No way. I signed for them.

173
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,968
It's my mission, my package.
I carry them, I deliver them.

174
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,477
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be
a little short of transportation right now,

175
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,351
so my Team Alpha
will deliver you to me.

176
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,226
And where exactly are you, sir?

177
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,686
Come see for yourself.

00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,002
I thought all you Special Ops guys
were tough.

180
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,753
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.

181
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,337
I got it. Thanks.

182
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,092

some real lifelike hair over there.

00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,759

187
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,099
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?

188
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,686
It's not regular Army,
based on all the accents.

189
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,102
You're British.
What are you, French North African?

190
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,771
Morocco. Where were you born?

191
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,527
(LAUGHS) Duke wasn't born.
He was government-issued.

192
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,030
-What about you?
-He doesn't speak.

193
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,072
-Why?
-He doesn't say.

194
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,115
He doesn't say.
So, somehow you're all in the same unit,

195
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,043
but one you can't tell me
the name of, right?

196
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,449
We'd get tossed for telling.

197
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,458
You're gonna go after those guys
that hit my convoy, huh?

198
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,246
Well, whoever you are
and whatever this unit is,

199
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,706
I want in.

General.

201
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,754
-What's up, girl?
-HAWK: Good job, Joes.

202
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,206
Outstanding.

203
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,844
Welcome to the Pit, Duke.
I've read a lot about you two.

204
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,086
Well, you can't believe
everything you read. See, I actually...

205
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,006
I understand we even tried to recruit you
a few years back.

206
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,468
-I never got asked to join any Op group.
-Really?

207
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,927
You don't remember Thailand
about four years ago?

208
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,098
Right before you broke up that bar?

209
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,806
About four years ago,
my boy had issues.

210
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,306
I mean, his issues had issues.

211
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,105
DUKE: I've been in the military
my entire life

212
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,612
and I have never seen
a tac operation like this.

213
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,565
HAWK: All right, you trusted me,
I guess I'll trust you.

214
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,828
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist,
but if it did,

215
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,079
it'd be comprised
of the top men and women

216
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,713
from the best military units in the world,
the alpha dogs.

COVER GIRL: Currently unknown.

225
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,149
SCARLETT: But one thing's for sure,

226
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,823
she's got highly classified intel
and state-of-the-art weaponry,

227
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,743
which means there's a whole
hell of a lot of money behind her.

228
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,411
Their capabilities are beyond anything
we've ever encountered.

229
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,491
Yeah, that's the one and only reason
why we got our asses kicked out there.

230
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,867
We need to find out
everything we can about her.

231
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,664
Knowing is half the battle.

232
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,125
Gentlemen, Mr McCullen,

233
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,883
CEO of MARS Industries
and the builder of these warheads.

234
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,764
General, clearly you were the
security option I should have chosen.

235
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,642
What did you just say? My team
did everything we could out there,

236
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,601
-and a lot of good men went down.
-Yeah, but not you.

237
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,313
That mission was classified,
so clearly someone sold us out.

238
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:04,305
I spent 1 0 years and 1 3 billion euros
creating these four warheads.

239
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,069
Yourjob, Captain, was to protect them,

240
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,821
and if it wasn't for General Hawk,
you'd have failed.

241
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,574
That's not a fair assessment.
He followed his orders to the letter.

242
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,028
Well, that wasn't enough.

243
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,119
Now, so the bastards who attacked you
can't find you,

244
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,745
you need to disable
the tracking beacon hidden in the case.

-We already have.
-Good man.

246

see if any have been damaged.

was going up, down and sideways.

Ten years setting this up,

this was supposed to be the easy part.

If you had let me stage the assault
at your precious factory,

259

in the process.

They, of course,
deactivated the homing beacon.

268

to quietly reactivate it.
