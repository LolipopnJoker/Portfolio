This building has been here 75 years. It
deserves to remain for the community...

00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,022
I don't know what to tell you.

488
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,015
Short of going in
and deliberately trying to get fired.

489
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,978
RUTH:
You stay away from that freezer!

490
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,460
Good morning, boys.

491
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:03,375
Oops. Sorry, I am so late.

492
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,417
That's fine. We only just got here.

493
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,681
- Forty-five minutes ago.
LUCY: Hmm.

494
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,643
Howie, are these your kids?

495
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,681
You know, I've never actually met them.

496
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,468
They are good-looking boys.

497
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,482
That's a girl. That's Sue and Paul.

498
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,516
LUCY: Yes, so it is.

499
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:27,702
You know what?
She is gonna be a heartbreaker.

500
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,320
That's Paul. LUCY: Hmm.

501
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,240
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sorry.

502
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,464
So we've got the Coney Island project.

503
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,584
I'd like to stir up some publicity
if we could.

504
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,050
Yes, very nice.

505
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,050
I'm...

506
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:59,642
I'm working on endorsements
from local merchants.

507
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,563
Hmm.

508
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,150
Any thoughts, George?

509
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:10,742
Yes, we were working
on some ideas there.

510
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,033
Hiya.

511
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,447
I thought that was a terrific meeting.
We should have more meetings like that.

512
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,121
- Pathetic.
- What's pathetic?

513
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,249
- You. I know what you're doing.
- I am not doing anything.

514
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,917
You think if you come in late and spit
on the boss that will get you fired?

515
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,798
Not in this company.

516
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,304
Chris. CHRIS: George.

517
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,255
George, I have an ulcer.

518
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,430
I don't sleep well, mostly because
you keep calling me at night.

519
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,940
If you don't call me,
I dream you're gonna call me.

520
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,943
I think about you in the shower,
not in a good way...

521
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:47,436
but in an I'm-so-distracted-I-can't-
remember-if-I washed-my-hair way.

522
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,439
So I wash my hair twice.

523
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,741
So I have a hole in my stomach,
I am running out of shampoo...

524
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,776
and today is the first time in my life
I did not give 1000 percent on the job...

525
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,622
and I hate that feeling!

526
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:09,417
- I won't call after hours.
- You will, George! You know you will.

527
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,512
Yeah, I will.

528
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:18,643
I just don't think we can see each other
professionally anymore.

529
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,109
All right. Stay until you find
a replacement.

530
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:33,527
Train him up for a couple of weeks,
then you can go to Slurpee Heaven.

531
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,487
Thank you! I promise I will find
you somebody amazing.

532
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,329
Somebody better than me
because I'm not even any good.

533
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,705
- No.
- A glorified ambulance chaser.

534
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,539
Thank you.

[CLANGING]

537
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,391
LUCY:
I got it. It's just my earring.

538
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,559
Ah! Ah! Ow!

539
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,148
- My hair!
GEORGE: That's my overpriced belt.

540
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,324
LUCY: Just get it off!

541
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,027
Howard.

542
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,358
Join us. We were just brainstorming.

543
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,913
Lucy? LUCY: Yes.

544
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:24,035
I was thinking it might be a good idea
to do a photo op at the build site...

545
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:27,036
where George would be in the...

546
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,844
George in the foreground,
pointing up to the sky...

547
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,594
- like this.
- Yes.

548
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:37,756
Then I thought I could take my belt off,
as if to say, let's get to work!

549
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:40,888
LUCY: Right. Right-o.

550
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,733
GEORGE: On behalf of Wade Corporation,
I thank the Community Board...

551
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,903
for giving us the opportunity
to work with you on this project.

552
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,273
And we look forward to seeing
all of you at the groundbreaking.

553
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,403
I did well with those eight people.

554
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,108
- I thought you were fantastic.
MAN: This way, Mr. Wade.

555
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,319
- Just Mr. Wade.
- Oh.

556
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,616
PHOTOGRAPHER: More.
- Great. Can we go now?

557
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,584
Absolutely. I just want to say hello
to my folks.

558
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,785
Your folks?

559
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,961
Excuse me.

560
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,786
Hello.

561
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,039
LARRY: Honey. LUCY: Hi.

562
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,000
- New coat? I like it.
LUCY: Thanks.

563
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,840
What a wonderful surprise!
We finally meet after all this time.

564
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,298
George Wade.

565
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,638
Mrs. Kelson, I presume.

566
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,894
What a pleasure.

567
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:32,310
Yeah. Well, I can certainly see
where Lucy gets her stare from.

568
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:34,442
I'm Larry. It's a pleasure to meet you.

569
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,649
Thanks, Larry. Same here.

570
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,660
Thank you for letting Lucy quit.
It certainly made our week.

571
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,493
- Great pleasure.
- We should get back to the office.

572
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,619
- Come on! Have some cake.
- We can't.

573
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,996
We're two blocks from the apartment.

574
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,463
- You live around here?
- Sure.

575
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,133
- What a charming coincidence.
- It won't be charming...

576
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:55,963
once you block out the sun
with this condo-hotel monstrosity!

577
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,803
We will have a sun deck.

578
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:03,721
That's something, isn't it?

579
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,682
GEORGE: I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your support on this.

580
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,691
LARRY: At least you're keeping
the community center.

581
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,864
Unless you're willing to reconsider
the entire project.

582
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,984
GEORGE: That won't happen.
It is over 50 million in profits.

583
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,652
RUTH: It's immoral that any human being
should acquire that much wealth.

584
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,492
I don't know how you sleep at night.

585
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,157
GEORGE: I have a machine
that simulates the ocean.

586
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,657
RUTH: Oh, God.

587
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,448
LUCY:
You're not helping yourself.

588
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:30,752
LARRY: Do those really work?
GEORGE: Yes.

589
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:36,673
LUCY: I used to come up here
when I was a kid. My special place.

590
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,668
Yes, well, every kid needs one.

591
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,337
I had a small one-bedroom
on Park and 91 st.

592
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,177
Well, that's so very Oliver Twist.

593
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:48,887
Times were hard. But you know what?
We were happy.

594
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,845
- Didn't have a view as good as this.
LUCY: It's great, isn't it?

595
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,192
I used to take up some ice cream
and my Carole King tape...

596
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,819
and look at the neighborhood.

597
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,565
It's amazing what you could see.
At night, the building went downstairs.

598
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,869
The fathers stood on one corner.
The mothers stood on the other.

599
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:09,374
Kids would just ride
their bicycles around.

600
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,037
As you can see, not much has changed.

601
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:15,542
Mr. And Mrs. Goldfarb would be sitting
in the middle of the street...

602
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,380
saving a parking space for their kids
who were coming next weekend.

603
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,046
And you up here on your own.

604
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,471
It's hard to find a quiet place
in Brooklyn to think.

605
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:33,023
Or to replay whatever argument
I just had with my mother.

606
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,602
Yes.

607
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,772
Yeah, she's terrifying.

608
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,071
I thought she was gonna kill me
and feed me to the poor.

609
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,566
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

610
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,912
But for better or worse, she's the voice
in my head pushing me to do better.

611
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:53,077
Challenge the accepted wisdom. Never
settle for a B instead of an A on a test.

612
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,418
You once got a B?

613
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,504
- Hypothetically speaking.
- Right.

614
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:04,093
Of course, no matter how hard I try,
I will never live up to her expectations.

615
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,720
Well, there are worse things in life.
Like no one having any expectations.

616
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,107
There's something amuck
with this sponge cake.

617
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,612
Tofu.

618
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,674
You're not concentrating.
This offends me.

619
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,958
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ton.

620
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,422
I lost Lucy.

621
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,347
I just think it's a shame because I've
come to rely on her for everything.

622
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,684
And I trust her completely,
and she's funny.

623
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,152
Not deliberately, of course.

624
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,813
Hey, you know, it's probably
for the best though.

625
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:03,282
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

626
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,275
Two things I know is chess and women.

627
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:13,371
Chess, it has rules, pieces,
rooks, knights, bishops.

628
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,366
They move in predictable patterns.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

629
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,000
But women, they don't have
no rules, man.

630
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,339
They move in unpredictable ways too.

631
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,005
Nobody ever wins or loses
when it comes to women.

632
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,514
You talk about your feelings until
your breath is sucked out your body.

633
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,219
All men are pawns when it comes
to women.

634
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,679
Especially a smart one like Lucy.
She's hard to control.

635
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:40,311
And you know, the man has got
to be in control.

636
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,230
Like with me.

637
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:48,449
I come home. When I walk in,
I know my mama has dinner on the table.

638
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:53,196
All right, so you're still living at home?

639
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,868
Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,906
Of course.

641
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:05,634
LUCY: Here's somebody interesting,
Polly St. Clair.

642
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:10,257
Well, it's a terrific résumé, Polly.

643
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,176
Congratulations on the baby.

644
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:13,604
What baby?

645
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,928
Maybe you should check with me
before you talk.

646
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,101
What baby?

647
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,187
I'd like to talk about
your moot-court experience.

648
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,438
What baby?

649
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,896
Yeah, what baby?

650
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,238
GEORGE: You should do the interviews
on your own from now on.

651
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,621
LUCY: Whatever you say, baby.

652
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,125
Harry Raskin, Richard Beck.

653
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:50,086
There's some interesting prospects
for my replacement. Let's see.

654
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,798
Richard Kelly from Yale.

655
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,258
No, it's gotta be a woman.

656
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,598
What a surprise.

657
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,392
I suppose a certain bust size would help.
Maybe some bathing-suit shots?

658
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,975
- It will annoy Howard if it's a woman.
- Oh.

659
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,475
- Thank you.
- Tell you what.

660
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,766
All I want is someone
as intelligent as you...

661
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,980
but a little less tense
and argumentative.

662
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,281
A sort of Katharine Hepburn figure.

663
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,156
You don't deserve Katharine Hepburn.

664
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,783
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Also too good.

665

Just stay away from the Hepburns.

- Oh.

GEORGE: I've got that charity
tennis thing tonight.

670
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,425
And I need to know, does this shirt make
me look a bit kind of Björn Borg?

671
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:46,812
Ansel and I got into a huge fight,
and I think we just broke up.

672
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,021
Really?

673
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,981
He wants me to go
on a Greenpeace boat.

674
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,992
He thinks I can't embrace life.

675
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,534
Is that the case?
Because I just don't see it.

676
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,238
I just don't see it.

677
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:01,333
And by the way, how can I embrace him
when he is never here?

678
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:06,956
Maybe it's me. Maybe the rose-colored
glasses have finally come off.

679
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,051
Okay.

680
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,174
We obviously can't leave you alone
with the stapler.

681
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,972
I'll tell you what. I'll cancel tennis.

682
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,346
They always make me play with Ed Koch.
What can we do to cheer you up?

683
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,925
Nothing. There's no solution.

684

Good. Good attitude.

685
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,393
I can't help it if I don't like boats.

686
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,805
Surely not all boats.

00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:31,862
Yes, all boats.

to drive men away.

There's Ansel.

There's Billy from Legal Aid who ran
off with a stripper.

So tell me. What's the matter with me?

698
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,690
Well, you can be somewhat intimidating.

699
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,442
You could loosen up a little,
get in touch with your feminine side.

700
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,450
- Okay, that's a good suggestion.
- Perhaps soften your appearance.

701
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:24,124
Not that I don't love that look,
but you could get dolled up occasionally.

I'm not going to spend hours
fluffing my hair and applying...

animal-tested makeup to my face...

704
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:34,762
just so I can turn myself into some
male fantasy, degrading Kewpie doll.

Unless I, you know, really like the guy
or something.

- You see, maybe that's the problem.
- Mmm.

You don't like these guys.

708

you realize they're wrong for you.

and ideals, all of them.

but what can I say?

I'm just not a romantic person.

Nope. No.

me parking. You know, parking?

about Nelson Mandela.

Don't know why I did that.

found it extremely erotic. Come back.

Until the Empire State Building.

- I find you annoying.
- Yes, I'm sure you do.

998
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:36,652
But it is pretty amazing what dreams
and lots of money can do, isn't it?

999
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,937
Yes, it is.

1000

- Yes, I am.

Not at all.
Unbearable would have been bearable.

I'll make sure June is set up.

- I have tennis elbow from the other day.
- Oh, yes?

- Lucy has tennis forehead. Much worse.
- Oh, no. I still feel terrible about that.

- It's a benefit...

Lucy makes us give money...

1020

Brilliant.

1021
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,332
- Sounds exciting.
- It would be almost impossible...

1022
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:18,003
to tell you how boring it is.
Largely because it would be too boring.

1023
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:24,300
Well, boring to you might be scintillating
for a girl from Plainview, Wisconsin.

- Okay.

Oh, good. These need to go
to Accounting.

NORMAN: I got it.

1031

GEORGE: Hang on. Hang on.

- Sorry. I gotta run.

We'll pick you up at eight
and go through it in the car.

on Island Towers.

Costs are skyrocketing.

we'd keep it.

01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:53,614
just throw in a couple egg rolls
and that would be great.

1315
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:04,620
MAN: For years, Coney Island has been
trying to attract this kind of development.

1316
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,035
WOMAN: Yeah. Right.

1317
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:10,833
Hopefully, Island Towers
is the start of big things to come.

1318
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,629
And now, it is my honor
to introduce to you...

1319
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:19,169
one of the men who made this
all possible, George Wade.

1320
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,762
- You look great.
- Go and earn your money, George.

1321
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:31,944
- Thanks so much.
- Great.

1322
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:35,404
Thank you very much,
Assemblyman Perez.

1323
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,069
Your mom is teaching today...

1324
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,196
so we'd better grab a bite to eat
and be on our way.

1325
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:45,454
We have some protesting to do
at the community center.

1326
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,537
I'm not going.

1327
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:50,044
- What are you talking about?
- I cannot watch...

1328
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,995
another building get knocked down.

1329
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:55,915
Hey. We didn't raise you
to sit on the sidelines.

1330
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:59,416
Ever since you were a little girl,
you fought for what you believed in.

1331
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,170
You were on the White House
Enemies list at 5.

1332
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,392
Dad, I'm not sitting on the sidelines.
I'm going to work.

1333
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:07,684
What's the point?
The man's not listen to me.

1334
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:11,558
Besides, you know, he said
some things to me that were just so...

1335
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,016
True.

1336
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,480
Then you change your tactics,
you change your argument.

1337
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:20,941
You don't give up.

1338
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:26,161
We didn't give up on civil rights
or equality for women or fair housing.

1339
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,203
- Honey.
- Hmm.

1340
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,329
As long as people can change,
the world can change.

1341
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,173
Yeah, but what if people can't change?

1342
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:37,249
Hmm.

1343
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:41,093
Well...

1344
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,296
let me put it this way.

1345
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:48,184
I'm sitting here eating a piece
of cheesecake made entirely of soy.

1346
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,973
And I hate it.

1347
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,096
But I'm eating it.

1348
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:04,702
I'm going to work. Bye. Good luck.

1349
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:13,961
LUCY: The law is clear on this.

1350
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,582
If the landlord has not kept up
proper maintenance, he cannot evict you.

1351
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,091
We will help you, Mrs. Munez.

1352
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:23,262
Let me run and get you some forms
you can fill out, and we'll get started.

1353
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,103
Well, hello.

1354
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:41,567
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

1355
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:45,783
Polly St. Clair? You interviewed me?
You thought I was having a baby?

1356
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:49,276
Oh, yes. Yes, Polly. Wow.

1357
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,989
- So you work here now.
- Uh-huh.

1358
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,409
- Terrific. How are you?
- Pregnant.

1359
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:58,123
- I'm not falling for that one again.
- No, I'm really pregnant.

1360
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:01,211
- You can congratulate me now.
- Polly, I was not born yesterday.

1361
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,668
I'm pregnant!
You want to see the damn sonogram?

1362
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,759
LUCY: Mrs. Munez,
we have two other cases...

1363
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,514
GEORGE: Hi.

1364
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:13,347
Hi. I'm busy.

1365
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,772
Yes.

1366
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,979
I need your advice on one last thing...

1367
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:21,606
and I promise
you will never hear from me again.

1368
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:25,323
I just delivered the first speech written
entirely by myself since we met...

1369
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:31,615
and I think I may have blown it,
so I wanted to ask your thoughts.

1370
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,793
Okay. Then I will read it to you.

1371
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,203
"I'd like to welcome everyone
on this special day."

1372
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,962
Island Towers will bring prestige
to the neighborhood...

1373
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,955
and be part
of Brooklyn's renaissance.

1374
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,377
And we're very pleased
and proud to be here.

1375
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:47,256
Unfortunately,
there is one fly in the ointment.

1376
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,224
You see, I gave my word to someone...

1377
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,344
that we wouldn't knock down
this building behind me.

1378
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:56,062
Normally, and those who know me or
were married to me can attest to this...

1379
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:00,234
my word wouldn't mean very much.
So why does it this time?

1380
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,265
Well, partly because this building
is an architectural gem...

1381
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,570
and deserves to be landmarked.

1382
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:11,574
Partly because people do need a place
to do senior's water ballet and CPR.

1383
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,990
Preferably not together.

1384
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:20,327
But mainly because this person,
despite being unusually stubborn...

1385
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:26,919
and unwilling to compromise
and a very poor dresser, is...

1386
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,918
She's...

1387
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:34,849
rather like the building
she loves so much.

1388
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:39,563
A little rough around the edges,
but when you look closely...

1389
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,307
absolutely beautiful.

1390
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,693
And the only one of her kind.

1391
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:55,907
And even though I've said cruel things
and driven her away...

1392
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:58,583
she's become the voice in my head.

1393
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:03,499
And I can't seem to drown her out.

1394
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:09,551
And I don't want to drown her out.

1395
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:16,925
So we are going to keep
the community center.

1396
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:22,021
Because I gave my word to her...

1397
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,769
"and because we gave our word
to the community."

1398
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,741
And I didn't sleep with June.

1399
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:38,778
That's not in the speech, that's me
letting you know that important fact.

1400
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:39,992
Okay.

1401
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,825
What do you think?

1402
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:56,933
I have to get back to work.

1403
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,187
GEORGE: Right.

1404
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:10,937
Right, yes, yes, yes. Sorry to disturb.

1405
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,407
Congratulations again, Polly.

1406
01:32:44,851 --> 01:32:49,101
Aside from the split infinitive
that was somewhere in the middle...

1407
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:53,153
that speech was actually
quite perfect, wasn't it?

1408
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:57,238
Yeah. I don't know what the hell
you're still doing sitting here.

1409
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,775
And I don't even like him.

1410
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,178
George!

1411
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:33,477
Oh.

1412
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:47,584
LUCY: George, I just want to say
thank you.

1413
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,539
Thank you and I know
I can be harsh and demanding...

1414
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:53,789
but I want to try and change
because I believe people can change.

1415
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:58,052
I can change and not be so demanding
and, you know, like, meet you halfway.

1416
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,296
I just... I know... Things just...

1417
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,385
Once I...

1418
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:08,427
GEORGE: Lucy...

1419
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:11,597
I am in love with you.

1420
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:16,572
And I'm in love with you.

1421
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,866
Oh, I should just mention
that I have resigned...

1422
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,750
- and am now poor.
- Good.

1423
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:34,424
When I say poor, I mean we may have to
share a helicopter with another family.

1424
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,246
Does that work for you?

1425
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:40,051
As long as I don't have to work
for you, we will be fine.

1426
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:41,836
Excellent.

1427
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:46,891
And now I would very much like to
discuss that whole bobcat-pretzel thing.

1428
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,890
Oh, I was just kidding.
I'm allergic to bobcats, actually.

1429
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,564
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1430
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,730
- But I can do the pretzel.
- That's excellent news.

1431
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:41,151
Hi, Mr. Wong, it's Lucy Kelson.

1432
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:45,989
I need one number 13,
two number sevens...

1433
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:48,827
I can't believe how small
this apartment is. It's shocking.

1434
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:54,503
I need three number eights, no garlic.

1435
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:57,626
It's good your parents went to the
movies. We'd never fit.

1436
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:03,094
I need one number seven and...

1437
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:06,718
I can walk from one side of this
apartment to the other in six seconds.

1438
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:12,176
- Watch this. One...
- And a number 11, please.

1439
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,810
No, actually this is for two.
