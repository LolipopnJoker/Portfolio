1
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,804
Come on.

2
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,924
Vincent.

3
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:14,141
No, no. Bad idea.
Bad idea.

4
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:46,090
-Do not feed bears.-

5
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:35,437
Just take what you need.

6
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,050
Just take what you need.

7
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:33,830
RJ? 
No.

8
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,110
The moon's not full.
You woke me up a week early?

9
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:48,860
Don't tell me you're actually dumb enough to
steal my stuff.

10
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,985
RJ I'm gonna have to kill you.

11
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:55,044
Please, I'm just a desperate guy trying to feed his family.

12
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:58,514
- You don't have a family.
- I meant a family of one.

13
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:03,562
Ok, wait, wait ,wait. 
Look, it's still in the cave so technically not stolen.

14
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:05,923
Oh, no.

15
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:13,800
Slope!

16
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,218
Stop.

17
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,793
Phew! That was close.

18
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,399
Vincent wait,
I can get it all back!

19
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,728
That's right, if you eat me
you'd have to do it.

20
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:38,000
But I can get it.
All of it!

21
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,975
- A red wagon?
- Redder!

22
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:44,237
- The blue cooler?
- Cooler, on my list.

23
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:47,607
- Gotta be blue?
- Yes, and I want my Spuddies.

24
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:53,088
I love those things.
Cos when you eat Spuddies enough just isn't enough.

25
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:58,286
So true, painfully true. And I'll tell you what. 
I'm gonna get the giant picnic pack family fun-size.

26
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,454
- They have that?
- I'm pretty sure.

27
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:08,276
Alright RJ, I'm going back to sleep.
When that moon is full I'm waking up.

28
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:13,435
And all my stuff had better be right back where it was.

29
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,884
But that's just one week.
That's impossible for one guy...

30
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:19,000
A week's perfect.
I'll get some helpers.

31
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,449
Full moon.
All my stuff.

32
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,675
and don't even think about running away

33
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:28,264
because if you do, I will hunt you down.
And kill you.

34
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,360
Ok, buddy.
You just rest easy all right cos I'm on it.

35
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,490
A week from now
you're gonna be laughing about this thing.

36
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:12,920
"Over The Hedge"™

37
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,387
Ahhh cold!
The one place i didn't have a shell.

38
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,012
Spring.

39
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:44,038
That means there's only 274 days left till winter!

40
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,012
Everybody wake up!
Hibernation's over!

41
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:49,211
Morning!
- Morning Hammy.

42
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:50,418
I gotta go wee-wee.

43
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:52,968
Oh! Not in the lake we drink from!

44
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:55,932
Let's go alright the rest of you, it's spring!

45
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,072
That means we got to get to work.

46
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,459
Ahh, finish.
Ohh! No, wait!

47
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,197
Come on everybody wake up.
Don't make me come in there.

48
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,870
Y'all better listen.
I've been holding something in all winter.

49
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,629
and I'm about to let it out.

50
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:16,156
Thank you, Stella.
- Oh I can clear a room, Verne.

51
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:17,915
That much I can do.

52
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:23,350
Goodmorning everyone.
Just a superduper morning eh.

53
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:28,221
Woah, not looking so good
around the eyes there, hon.

54
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,502
Bucky and Grill were up every 3 or 4 weeks.

55
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:32,379
and Spikey kept poking me.

56
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,259
Well, he's kinda poky.

57
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:36,134
Yup, he's the sharpest of the bunch.

58
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:38,581
You know what?
How about i take the day shift.

59
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,610
Oh Lou, that'd be just super.

60
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:43,552
Alright kids, you heard your mother 
and now you listen to me.

61
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:44,754
Shape up there!

62
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,658
This is what I was afraid of.

63
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:53,278
Where's the food? Is there any food left?
I'm really hungry! So is there any food left in here?!

64
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,725
We ate all the food Hammy,
during the winter.

65
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:57,634
So, we gotta go and get somemore now.

66
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,721
I hid some nuts in the woods and I know where they are now so I'll be right back. Bye!

67
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:09,826
Dad, it was just snow.

68
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:12,182
What? It could have been a predator.

69
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:14,615
Isn't playing dead a little...weak?

70
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,812
Heather, how many times must i say it?

71
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:19,692
Playing possum is what we do.

72
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,004
We die,
so that we live!

73
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:24,918
Kids, ok
so just calm down!

74
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:27,937
This is a week to find you a you know,
a good fella.

75
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:30,533
A good fella?

76
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,802
Why does everyone think
I need a man, huh?

77
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,158
I look like a mess
and smell like a swamp.

78
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:41,894
So when you find a fella who is decent,
good with kids and has no sense of smell, call me.

79
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,846
Oh look, food!

80
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,408
Well i think you know,
what this means.

81
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,384
Verne?
- Just a minute, Hammy.

82
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:05,932
This means we are nine berries
away from starvation.

83
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,192
Sorry, that was a little intense.

84
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,754
I meant really serious hunger pains.

85
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,014
Verne!
- Not finished, Hammy.

86
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,456
Mornin' Lou, Penny. -Thanks.
Hey kids.

87
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,581
So, what i want to tell you all is...

88
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,086
I'm not done, Hammy!
If you have to go again, just go!

89
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:25,475
Ok, so all I'm saying is that
we got a little close.

90
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:30,230
So this year we got to make sure we fill the log...
- all the way to the top.

91
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,254
Exactly!
All the way to the top!

92
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,495
Because, what are we?
- Foragers!

93
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:37,168
And what do we forage?
- Food!

94
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,985
Super Verne, really super.
- Ok, Hammy.

95
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,283
What is it?
- What is what?

96
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:44,956
What is it you wanted to tell me?

97
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,509
Ohh..What was it, what was it, what was it?!

98
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,105
Right at the tip of my tongue!

99
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:53,682
Oh yeah, there's a weird thing over there!
I've never seen before!

100
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,134
It's really scary!
Follow me!

101
00:10:58,394 --> 00:11:01,408
Ok, meeting called on account of weird, scary thing.

102
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,264
Hmm, Foragers.

103
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:09,437
Hammy, what weird thing?

104
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,499
Oh, that weird thing.

105
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,432
It never ends!

106
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:52,259
It never ends that way too.

107
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:05,745
What is this thing?
- Heather, no!

108
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:09,019
I'm scared.
- Me too, mommy.

109
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:12,120
It's ok, It's just a...
What is this thing Lou?

110
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:15,173
Well, it's a... Verne?

111
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:19,692
Well, it's obviously
some kind of bush.

112
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:22,740
I would be a lot less afraid of it
if I just know what's it called.

113
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:23,745
Let's call it Steve.

114
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,648
Steve?
- It's a pretty name.

115
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:28,639
Steve sounds nice.
- Ya, and a lot less scary, Steve.

116
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,860
Oh, great and powerful Steve,
what do you want?

117
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,947
I don't think he can speak.

118
00:12:34,947 --> 00:12:36,346
I heard that, young man.

119
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,500
You get over here right now!

120
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,514
Hammy, get back here.
- But Steve is angry.

121
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:45,875
I think it came from the other side of Steve,
I mean the bush, I mean...jeez...

122
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:52,557
Look there's only one way we can find out
what this thing is.

123
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:54,831
and what this is all about,
I'm gonna go check it out.

124
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,817
Steve ate Verne!

125
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:10,211
Alright Steve, you brought this on yourself.

126
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,999
Stella, don't.
I'm not eaten.

127
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,716
I just tripped.

128
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,658
I'm gonna go over there,
don't anybody move.

129
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,437
What is this place?

130
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:00,307
Hey there, little...

131
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:02,504
fella.

132
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:44,807
Good day, can I help you?

133
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,913
Oh, I can talk.
I'm just driving.

134
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:09,586
What was that?
- Mama, get him.

135
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,081
What was over there?
Freaky, pink primates.

136
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:16,466
They must have come while we were hibernating
and they...it was awful.

137
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:19,317
They had wheels on their feet,
and they had these sticks.

138
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:23,139
And they were whacking me with these sticks
like it was some kind of sick game.

139
00:15:23,216 --> 00:15:26,874
You should have died!
You should have laid down, and died.

140
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,149
That's not the worst part,
half the forest is gone!

141
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:37,086
All the trees, the berry bushes,
they're just, gone.

142
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,884
What will we do for food?

143
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:46,317
I don't know.
But, here's what I do know.

144
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:50,557
We will be fine as long as no one
 goes over Steve again.

145
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:51,596
It's called a hedge.

146
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:54,543
And it is not to be feared
my amphibious friend.

147
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:57,898
It is the gateway to the good life.

148
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:02,432
I'm a reptile actually,
but you know it's a common mistake.

149
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:06,509
And you are?
- Oh, where are my manners?

150
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,326
I'm RJ.
Now please don't think I'm prying.

151
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,961
But I couldn't help overhearing, and I
think I can shed a little light on what this whole hedge situation is about.

152
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:17,759
You see, what was once mere wilderness
is now...

153
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:22,125
54 acres of man-made manicured air-condtioned paradise.

154
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:25,355
Except for that little bitty speck,
you are here.

155
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:29,024
Noo, that's a good thing.
You're hibernaters right?

156
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,461
Gather up a bunch of food,
store it away for the winter?

157
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:32,913
Uh-huh, we fill the log.

158
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:36,629
Really? This log?
This cave-like log?

159
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,932
All the way to the top.
- Ozzie!

160
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:43,235
Let me ask kid?
How long does it take, to fill the log?

161
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:44,985
274 days.

162
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,802
Ever done it in a week?

163
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,908
That's impossible.
- Not if we work together.

164
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:54,581
You see, you've got the food gathering skills, I've got
the know-how, and they've got the food!

165
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,519
How much food?
- Loads of food!

166
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:59,177
Heaps of food!
Food out the wa-zoo!

167
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:04,078
Well, you know whatever food comes out of the wa-zoo,
I don't think we're really interested in eating.

168
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,394
I don't know, the guy's making a lot of sense to me.
I think we should listen.

169
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:10,711
Yea...I'm ok with wa-zoo food.
- No, you're not.

170
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,381
The tail is tingling.

171
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,164
The what,
is what?

172
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,326
When something doesn't feel right
my tail tingles.

173
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:22,365
And let me tell you something.
Everything you said so far is driving my tail crazy.

174
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:26,232
Listen. Verne, right?
This isn't something you need to be afraid of.

175
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,576
Well, I am.
And for good reason.

176
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:34,179
This is not a birthmark.
- Cos' you went over there without a guide Verne.

177
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,683
Whatever, thanks for stopping by,
we're not interested.

178
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:40,222
Not interested in the most delicious
food you've ever tasted?

179
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:44,044
Come on.
- Not, interested.

180
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:52,009
Ok, I get it. I understand.
This is something you're just not open to.

181
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,885
What is that?!

182
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:08,097
That my friend is
a magical combination of...

183
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:13,693
corn, dehydrated cheese solids,
VHA, VHT and good'ol MSG.

184
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:17,371
Aka, the chip.
Nacho cheese flavour.

185
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,246
Damn, Verne, those were good.

186
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:26,317
It's all good,
and we're going over there, tonight.

187
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:31,962
Welcome, to suburbia.

188
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,192
Hey mom, look at us.

189
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:44,929
How's that tail, Verne?

190
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:49,746
Listen, if anybody in this family
gets hurt, I'm holding you personally responsible.

191
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:53,048
They're having a good time,
I'll take responsibility for that.

192
00:18:56,977 --> 00:19:00,794
Hey Verno, I took a few clippings out of my quills
to do a little comparison,

193
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:04,208
Look at this,
the grass seems to be greener over here.

194
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:08,347
Verne, are you certain you came to the same place?
- Yeah, cos you know the racoon says...

195
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,833
Ok, enough about him.
I get it.

196
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:14,775
So, he can do a couple of tricks,
I mean it's not like he can walk on water.

197
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:17,054
Hey, everybody.
This way to the food.

198
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,646
What is that?
- That is an SUV.

199
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:27,736
Humans ride around in it,
because they are slowly losing their ability to walk.

200
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:31,271
Jeepers, that's so big.
- How many humans fit in there?

201
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:32,986
Usually?
One.

202
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:37,298
Hi, this is Gladys Sharp,
your president.

203
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:39,164
Of the Home-owners Association.

204
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,770
What is that?
- Easy, easy. Don't worry.

205
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:47,361
That's just a human being.
And they're just as scared of us, as we are of them.

206
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:50,846
Now, if a human does happen to see you,
just lay down...

207
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,039
roll over, and give your privates
a good licking. They love it.

208
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,501
The charter, which you signed,
says the grass is supposed to be 2 inches.

209
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:01,607
But, according to my measuring stick,
yours is 2.5.

210
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,102
Can we just get the food
and go?

211
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,222
Do they have it or not?
- Din't you see, it was in the box.

212
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:13,457
They always got food with them.
We eat to live, these guys live to eat.

213
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:16,309
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

214
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:18,798
The human mouth,
is called the piehole.

215
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:21,433
The human being, is called the couch potato.

216
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:24,058
That is the device
to summon food.

217
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,385
That is one of the many
voices of food.

218
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,193
That is the portal
for the passing of the food.

219
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,653
That is where the many food
transportation occurs.

220
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:37,025
Humans bring the food, take the food,
ship the food.

221
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,881
They drive the food.
They wear the food.

222
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,521
That gets the food hot.
That keeps the food cold.

223
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:44,482
That...
I'm not sure what that is.

224
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:48,942
Whadda' ya know,
food!

225
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,006
That is the altar
where they worship food.

226
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,337
That's what they need
when they've eaten too much food.

227
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:57,996
That get rids of the guilt
so they can eat more food!

228
00:20:58,576 --> 00:21:00,125
Food!
Food!
Food!

229
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:05,073
So, you think they have enough?

230
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:10,028
Well they don't. For humans,
enough is never enough.

231
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,760
And what do they do with
the stuff they don't eat?

232
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:19,567
They put it in gleaming, silver cans. 
Just for us.

233
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,573
Dig in!

234
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:29,304
Good, isn't it?

235
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,794
That's a diaper,
and that does come out of a wa-zoo.

236
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:44,903
What do you think, was i right,
or was i right?

237
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,117
And these things are just the scraps!

238
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:50,246
Wait till you see what comes in the boxes,
and the packages, and the cans.

239
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:54,217
You stick with me, and in one week
we'll gather enough food to...

240
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:56,701
to feed a bear!

241
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,405
Just, figure of speech.

242
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:05,115
Halt!
Intruders! Intruders!

243
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,472
Get out, all of you!
- What is it, Skapy?

244
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,236
What are you doing?
- You said we should lick our...

245
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,298
No! Next step!
Run!

246
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,390
Run!
- Get out of here!

247
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:23,617
I just bought this patio.

248
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:33,519
You kids ok?
Hon, you alright there?

249
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,510
See what i mean?
That's what I was talking about.

250
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,597
This humans don't want us around.

251
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:41,924
So, we scared her and she overreacted.

252
00:22:42,025 --> 00:22:43,746
No biggie.
- No biggie?

253
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,097
Ohh...That is what we call a biggie.

254
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:49,121
Come on, think about all the food,
it was worth it for that food.

255
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:50,915
That stuff is to die for.

256
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,528
Let me rephrase that.
- No, to die for, you nailed that part.

257
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,592
Seems our little forest life looks too
primitive to a guy with a bag.

258
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:05,576
But I think I speak for the whole family
when I say we want nothing...

259
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:07,963
to do with anything
that's over that hedge.

260
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,155
Oh, come on.

261
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,101
Y'all haven't even tried donuts yet.

262
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:17,453
You want to store fat?
That is the way to store some fat.

263
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:19,346
You'll be sweating through the winter.

264
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:24,015
Ok, alright, you guys sleep on it.

265
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:27,063
Good idea, I'm gonna check back with ya.

266
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:32,554
Shoot!
Almost had it.

267
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,688
...food...

268
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,563
Time's up, RJ.
- But I have six more days!

269
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:22,615
Ohh...four paws, fur,
still alive...still alive.

270
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:44,365
Ok kids, dive in, there it is.
Bark for breakfast.

271
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:47,871
I want a donut.
- I want pizza.

272
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,333
Ok, this is great.

273
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,192
Granted, it takes some time to chew.

274
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:25,663
That was very satisfying.
And by the way, lots of fibre in there too.

275
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:31,991
I gotta admit
that does look tasty.

276
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:36,890
What are you doing here?
- I'm here to help you with your... foraging thing.

277
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:43,134
Look, Verne. You said a word yesterday,
about your little gang here, starts with an F.

278
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:44,135
Do you remember what it was?

279
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:49,342
Family?
- Right. You know, that got me right here.

280
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:55,323
You see, Verne. I used to have all that.
My own place, surrounded by loved ones.

281
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:57,145
Universal remote.

282
00:25:57,246 --> 00:26:01,803
But then all that went away with the...
weed-hack incident.

283
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,135
Ohh...come here.

284
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,573
Jeepers, Verne.
- We could always use the extra hand there, you know.

285
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:15,576
The weed-hacker, Verne.

286
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:22,049
Not your problem.
I'll just go.

287
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:27,121
This is me, going.

288
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,039
Sure I'll see you around the forest.

289
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:40,905
Hey, RJ.
You can stay.

290
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,285
Come here you big!
I knew beneath that hard, is crispy outside...

291
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:49,865
there's a soft, noughety center in there.
You mind if i call you Uncle Verne?

292
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,740
With every bone in my body.
- Great. Hey, can i walk with Hammy?

293
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,530
You want to help me find my nuts?
Very tempting, Hammy.

294
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,636
But first, I want to show you this.

295
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:04,660
You like this cookie?

296
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,028
Well this cookie is...
Junk!

297
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:08,711
I like the cookie.

298
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:15,770
Don't worry, I know where we can get some cookie 
so valuable that they are hand-delivered by uniformed officers.

299
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:22,943
And there they are,
America's most coveted cookies.

300
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:26,919
Love-handles, Skinny-Mints,
Neener-Neeners and Smackeroons!

301
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,943
And guess what,
they're all yours!

302
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,326
Woah Hamilton,
hold on there fella.

303
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:35,336
I love your energy,
but you can't just take 'em.

304
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:36,467
But you just said they're mine.

305
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:41,692
They will be if we successfully marry your manic
energy to my brilliant plan.

306
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,611
You with me kid?
- I, i, i..

307
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,357
The eyes have it, let's ride.

308
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,323
You step away from those cookies
They're mine.

309
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,538
Hey, this guy's not coming is he?
Cos i don't want him to.

310
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:05,679
Ohh...I've got so much work to do.

311
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,655
Come here, step into my office.
Now, listen up.

312
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:12,663
What we're going for here is a
vicious, man-eating, rabid squirrel.

313
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:14,611
Can you handle that?
- Excuse me.

314
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,457
Yes, Hammy.

315
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,160
Rabbits aren't vicious.
They're all cute and cuddly.

316
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:23,153
Rabid, not rabbit.

317
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:28,160
Ok, first watch the hair...

318
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:34,539
...on the tail...

319
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:37,365
...liking that alot.

320
00:28:37,664 --> 00:28:39,298
Show me that look in your eye, boy! C'mon!

321
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,160
Oh, I can burp my ABCs!
A, B, C...

322
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:49,433
I just really need you to focus right now, ok?

323
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:10,116
Done! Now, come on.
I'll be right behind you.

324
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:12,963
Go on, get out there.
Shoo. Shoo!

325
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:18,163
I'm a crazy rabid-squirrel.
I want my cookies!

326
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,871
Rabies!

327
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:30,544
Hey, it's working.
- Behind you!

328
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:31,938
I know you're,
right behind m...

329
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:40,467
Walk it off,
just walk that one off.

330
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:43,217
What is going on? Is that Hammy?
- Everything's under control, just go back to the hedge.

331
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:46,192
You call that under control?
He's under attack!

332
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,192
He's working.
- I'm coming, Hammy.

333
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:11,788
Verne, that was great.
You, my friend, are a natural.

334
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:15,371
Or should I say, "all-naturale".

335
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:24,852
Hammy, you are awesome my man.
You had me scared.

336
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,270
I was about to come out
and beat you with a book myself.

337
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,942
There! He was right over there.
- That's where the squirrel attacked us.

338
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:42,153
He has like rabies or something.
- And there was this gross, naked amphibian thing.

339
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,846
Reptile.

340
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,433
It's ok girls, go inside have a cookie,
turn on the TV and calm down.

341
00:30:49,035 --> 00:30:53,313
I'm sorry Janice,
did I just hear them say rabid-squirrel.

342
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:56,765
Oh, I think they might just be overreacting.
- But what if they're not?

343
00:30:56,765 --> 00:31:02,159
What if we have a potential pandemic on our hands.
Vermin running loose, spreading diseases

344
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:04,351
and lowering our property value.

345
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:10,563
Yea...I have casserole in the oven. Gotta run.
- Fine, you worry about your casserole.

346
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:14,121
And I'll worry about the end of Suburbia
for peace and tranquility.

347
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:22,611
That's right, don't push, plenty for everybody.
Got a box right over here for you, Penny.

348
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:27,260
Oh jeepers, that is good, kids eat up.
Anything that taste this good, has to be good for you.

349
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,183
You feel that buzzing at the back of you skull?
That's called sugar-rush. It's what keeps the humans going.

350
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:35,424
That's why they don't hibernate.
To top that off, a little of this...

351
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:39,068
and what usually takes you all summer,
is only gonna take us a week.

352
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:44,400
Oh, hold on, HamSquad!
The last thing you need is caffeine.

353
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:52,059
That's right, come on, dig in
because this my friends is just the beginning.

354
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:17,525
Hello, I need every business list
that you have under 'exterminator'.

355
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,736
Can I poke him?
- No!

356
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:09,485
Debbie, I don't remember seeing a permit out for
a gathering.

357
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:11,523
Groups of more than one who wish to get...AHH!

358
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,704
Timmy, get the shovel from the car.

359
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:22,476
Lights fading.
Limbs growing cold.

360
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,835
Mother, is that you?
Beckoning me into the light?

361
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,960
Must...move...
toward...the...light.

362
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:39,277
What do you think he's doing?
- Maybe we knock he's brain or something.

363
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:43,530
I'm telling you. You went to far this time.
Let's just get out of here and leave this...

364
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:45,619
Nice catch, Verne.

365
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:49,893
You're dangerous, you're insane.

366
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,081
Goodbye, cruel world.

367
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:02,902
Rose-bud.

368
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:10,414
Now can i poke him?
- Nooo!

369
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:15,811
U see, this is exactly why I called the exterminator,
to kill them, before they get hurt like this.

370
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,170
Everybody get out of here, right now.

371
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,603
Right. Ok, grab those handles.

372
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:33,784
Verminator.

373
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,936
I believed someone phoned about an animal problem.
The solution is standing before you.

374
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:04,896
Dwayne is here.
- Where have you been?

375
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:10,340
I'm throwing a 'welcome to the neighbourhood' party tomorrow and so far
Debbie's car have killed more animals than you have.

376
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:17,362
Stand down sister, I personally guarantee
that there will not be a living thing at this party.

377
00:36:17,362 --> 00:36:20,668
Verminator is on the job.

378
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:24,331
Leave it.
- Ahh, what do we have here?

379
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:33,885
Didelphis marsupialis virginiananis,
approximately 10pounds, male.

380
00:36:34,347 --> 00:36:39,981
I think he's dead.
- O really, do you in fact have an associate's degree from Vermtech?

381
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,766
I think he wants you to think he's dead.

382
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,391
Move, move. That's it, hurry, run.

383
00:36:48,898 --> 00:36:52,027
I certainly hope he's not in any pain.

384
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,135
Kill it!
- Thank you all for coming.

385
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,199
You were a great audience.

386
00:37:01,391 --> 00:37:04,795
Alright, what am I up against here.

387
00:37:04,898 --> 00:37:11,206
Possum, porcupine, skunk,
squirrel, racoon, amphibian.

388
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:16,034
Reptile.
- No, reptile...

389
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:26,891
That's what I call a superduper performance there fella.
- Oz! You were riveted man, you were awesome!

390
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:33,670
Dad, I guess I gotta say uhh...
That was pretty good.

391
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:38,340
Props for the Ozman!

392
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:43,844
Let's not forget our brilliant leadership, RJ.

393
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:51,501
Come this way, we want to show you something.
- Yea, sure.

394
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:53,206
Sweet.

395
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:55,614
What a team.

396
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:06,418
Over here, this way.
- RJ, come on, we want to show you something. Hurry!

397
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:08,324
Check it out.

398
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,706
Your new home.

399
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:22,789
Look, we got a place for you right here.
- That's for me?

400
00:38:22,891 --> 00:38:26,603
Yea, is this anything like what you had, RJ?

401
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:29,983
This is everything like
what I had, Lou.

402
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:33,873
Here, I'm not supposed to drink this.
- Thanks.

403
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:38,239
Is that my bag?
- Yea, we brought it here so you wouldn't...

404
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,481
have to sleep up in that old tree.

405
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:46,016
Hey RJ, check this out,
we totally hooked up the TV.

406
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,090
I hotwired the HD-converter.
- We get like a thousand channels.

407
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:55,505
Here, can you take the remote before my dad does.
- Wow, universal remote.

408
00:38:57,505 --> 00:39:00,340
This is nice guys.
Really nice.

409
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:05,148
We now return to
'A Scoundrel Among Us'.

410
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:09,655
You should be ashamed of yourself!
We let you into our family and you deceived us.

411
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:13,443
I give you my heart
and you ripped it into a million pieces.

412
00:39:13,744 --> 00:39:17,090
Get real , Kevin.
Cos when you feel like a dirtbag.

413
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:23,715
It's because you're a dirtbag, right?
So just say it our loud, 'I am a dirtbag'.

414
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:29,130
Dirtbag? I don't think that guy is a real doctor.
What do yo think there, RJ?

415
00:39:35,132 --> 00:39:39,324
Woah RJ, what are you doing man.
You're getting in way too deep.

416
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,911
Just get the food, feed the bear.

417
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,152
Where's the food?!!

418
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:01,077
Verne, what are you doing?
- I'm putting things back to the way they were.

419
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:06,360
No don't. How about if I just leave?
- Good, you leave and i return this stuff to the rightful owners.

420
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:10,898
What? why?!
- Because... we've angered the humans.

421
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:13,210
And we don't want to end up like that rabbit.

422
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,335
Hence, I'm giving this back,
so they won't kill us.

423
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:22,101
Verne, you don't understand.
We need this stuff.

424
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,085
No, we don't.
- You can't take it.

425
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:28,219
Yes I can.
- Let go.

426
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:30,655
You let go.
- I have to have it.

427
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,876
Verne, move slowly,
keep your voice low and follow me.

428
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:58,190
No, I'm not falling for anymore of
your smooth talk.

429
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:02,911
Idon't knw what you're up to but,
my whole shell is tingling...

430
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,824
and you know what, I'm listening to it this time.
And I'm putting my foot down.

431
00:41:08,827 --> 00:41:09,795
Play?

432
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:14,914
Play!

433
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:34,353
Let's play.

434
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,266
Get down boy! Sit! Rollover!

435
00:41:51,768 --> 00:41:54,456
Atta'boy Verne, save the food,
I'll lose the dog.

436
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,016
You're dropping all the food, man!
Here, catch.

437
00:42:11,858 --> 00:42:13,880
You hungry?
Look, food!

438
00:42:18,266 --> 00:42:21,177
Look, people, play with them.

439
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,112
I'm alright, I'm fine.

440
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:35,268
Verne, unhook the chain.

441
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:01,827
Verne, I told you to unhook the chain.

442
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:38,297
You're the devil.

443
00:43:57,606 --> 00:44:00,579
Verne, you alright there?
Give me a hand, Oz.

444
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:06,885
What the heck happened?
- It's gone...the food! Gone!

445
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:10,998
What? How is it gone?
- Ask...him.

446
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:17,119
I returned it to it's rightful owners.

447
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,034
We like, worked our tails off you know,
like alot, and the food we got was totally...you know.

448
00:44:24,135 --> 00:44:25,831
You're like a...whatever.

449
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:30,443
What were you thinking? The log was full.
- Full of junk.

450
00:44:30,545 --> 00:44:34,094
Ohh, so what are you saying?
That the food we gathered our way...

451
00:44:34,184 --> 00:44:36,876
isn't as good as the food
we gathered your way?

452
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:41,545
Your way? You mean his way.
Can't you see RJ is just using you?

453
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:45,300
Shame on you, RJ wouldn't do that.

454
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:49,530
You have got to trust me on this.
Don't you understand there's something wrong with this guy?

455
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:52,931
My tail tingles everytime
I get near him.

456
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:56,126
So, we're supposed to go hungry
because your butt's vibrating?

457
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:59,686
I'm starting to think that the little tingle of yours
is just you being jealous.

458
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:05,697
Jealous? Of him?
- Yea, he's embracing the future and you're just holding us back.

459
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:08,565
I'm holding you back alright,
from extinction!

460
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:12,264
See what you've done here?
If you listen to half of the stuff you're telling them...

461
00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:13,670
You'll be dead within a week!

462
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,911
You are only interested in taking advantage of them
because they are too stupid and naive.

463
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:24,719
I'm not stupid.

464
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:32,585
I didn't mean...
I meant ignorant.

465
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:41,309
The way's over there, come on you guys,
you know I didn't mean it like that.

466
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:45,085
Don't do this, Stella, Ozzie.

467
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:49,389
Hammy, you know I...

468
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,681
Hammy?
- I'm not stupid.

469
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:46,094
Goodnight, Uncle RJ.
- Goodnight kiddo.

470
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:56,936
Moon's full, RJ.
See you in the morning.

471
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,664
I got ya.

472
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:43,777
Is it done?
- Affirmative.

473
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,257
And did you put this one in?
This D-Ultra-Turbo?

474
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:51,362
That's a contraband item, mdm.
As it is illegal in every state, except Texas.

475
00:47:51,465 --> 00:47:55,335
I don't care if this thing is against 
the Geneva conventions, I want it!

476
00:47:55,998 --> 00:48:00,114
I thought you might.
So, I took the liberty of installing it for you.

477
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,969
Adios, animal infestation.

478
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:29,184
What have I done?

479
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,443
I shouldn't have taken all that food.
- What?

480
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:39,893
I shouldn't have taken all that food.
I was just trying to return things to the way they were, that's all.

481
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:42,476
I was just being cautious,
cos that's what I am.

482
00:48:42,574 --> 00:48:44,719
I'm naturally tentative.

483
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:47,483
There's even places in my shell I've haven't been.

484
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:52,376
You, on the other hand,
you're like cool, and crazy and fearless.

485
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:54,972
I think they're right,
I think I'm just jealous.

486
00:48:56,784 --> 00:49:01,007
Verne, believe me,
you should not be jealous of me.

487
00:49:01,862 --> 00:49:05,577
You've got a good thing here.
You're just trying to do what's best for your family.

488
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:07,324
I think you're what's best for them now.

489
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:09,952
What about your tail?

490
00:49:11,405 --> 00:49:18,713
My head says listen to my tail, my tail says listen to my head.
I just end up with an upset stomach.

491
00:49:18,815 --> 00:49:22,748
That's why you need to be in charge now.
- You don't really know what's going on here...

492
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:27,693
And, you do. So, what's the problem?
- This is the problem.

493
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:30,632
See this?
- I'm listening.

494
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:33,757
Just, hang on a second.

495
00:49:35,677 --> 00:49:39,697
Hi, uh... you're the lady throwing the party?
- Yes, just to the right.

496
00:49:39,795 --> 00:49:43,603
There are protective
put on over yout shoes.

497
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:51,335
What is this?
- What?

498
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:57,501
That...is a list of...
all the stuff that you lost, Verne.

499
00:49:57,603 --> 00:50:03,260
It's a big long list.
- You're an organised little guy aren't you.

500
00:50:03,362 --> 00:50:07,773
But, you know what. I know a place that is choked full of food.
We can get it all back in one night.

501
00:50:07,873 --> 00:50:11,697
Great, Let's go. Where is it?
- Inside that house.

502
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:19,266
What is the point of this thing?
- Just send it down.

503
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:24,822
What Verne is trying to say is,
well it's hard to really sum it all up in just one word...

504
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:27,489
I'm sorry.

505
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:33,367
Come here.
- Give me a hug.

506
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:36,510
Ok listen, here is the plan.

507
00:50:36,612 --> 00:50:49,331
Traps are set here, here, here, here, here...and here.

508
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,268
Big one here.

509
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:02,550
Maybe a few over here.
- Sheesh, is that all?

510
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:07,422
No, there's a bunch of red lights all over here.
- U ok Verne, looking a little faint.

511
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:13,539
I blacked out for a second there, but I get the idea.
There's lights, traps, I think i need to change my shell.

512
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:16,802
Ok, this is us.
- Can I be the car?

513
00:51:17,056 --> 00:51:19,789
I wanna be the car.
- No, I'm the car! You be the shoes.

514
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:23,869
Shoe is lame.
Why don't you be that snazzy lokking iron there.

515
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:28,273
Hey, it's not important.
Besides I'm the car, I'm always the car.

516
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:32,108
Now the plan works in 3 simple steps:
Step one: Clear the lights.

517
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:36,215
Step Two: Get inside.
Step Three: Get out with a mountain of food.

518
00:51:36,315 --> 00:51:41,018
This place is like a fortress, walls so high,
doors impenetrable.

519
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,168
How do we get in?
- The collar is the key.

520
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:49,744
Literally, the collar is like
a key that opens the door...

521
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:55,306
and what, you think he's just gonna hand over his collar to you?
- Not to me my femme fatale...to you.

522
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:56,603
Her?
- Me?

523
00:51:56,706 --> 00:52:01,411
You Stella, we'll get that cat to give you that collar by using...
- My stink.

524
00:52:01,514 --> 00:52:03,338
Your feminine charm.

525
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,215
Was that out loud?

526
00:52:06,315 --> 00:52:14,362
Look racoon, maybe that ass you're wearing is obstructing your view, but if you haven't notice, I'm a skunk.

527
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:20,994
Outside maybe, but I'm looking inside Stella, and i see
a fox. All we gotta do is get her out.

528
00:52:26,036 --> 00:52:28,552
Scissors.
- Scissors?!

529
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:30,831
Charcoal.
- Charcoal?

530
00:52:32,686 --> 00:52:34,485
Air freshener.
- Tomato juice.

531
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:36,789
Cork.
- Cork? Don't you dare.

532
00:52:39,748 --> 00:52:42,574
Alright we scored! Yeah!

533
00:52:45,936 --> 00:52:49,523
One more thing.
Woah stop. That's it.

534
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:54,061
Ladies and gentlemen, our work here is done.

535
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:00,911
Big jeepers.
- She's all like...wow!

536
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,219
Alright gang, this is it. We're going in.

537
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:42,960
Oh, not again. Damn it, those things are so life-like.
Curse you, plastic mouldsmen.

538
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:23,771
Go, go, go.

539
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:26,751
No, no, no...No!

540
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:32,023
Hammy, I told you that cookie's junk.
- I love the cookie.

541
00:54:32,972 --> 00:54:36,795
What's going on?
Is everything ok?

542
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:47,536
Here we go.
Come on Hammy, follow the red light.

543
00:54:49,614 --> 00:54:54,112
That's it, that's it.
There it is. Go and get it.

544
00:55:03,302 --> 00:55:05,802
Go get it, you little nut.

545
00:55:07,914 --> 00:55:09,737
Bingo!
Ok, step two.

546
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:13,072
I thought we'd be dead by step two
so this is going great!

547
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:18,177
Ok, gorgeous. You're on.

548
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:25,273
Man...This better be one stupid cat.
- Audio, go!

549
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:33,184
She must be a cat. Turn it on cat.
Let's hope the cat likes a cow.

550
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:35,206
Who goes there?

551
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:38,434
You're a cat.
- You're a cat.

552
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:41,648
Uhh, I mean I'm a cat.

553
00:55:43,536 --> 00:55:49,882
Ya, I know, shoo, go, get away from here.
My owner those not give scraps to common strays.

554
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:52,710
Common strays?
- Alright, you asked for it...

555
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:57,311
Gee, that's a nice collar you got on.
- Mind if I have a look?

556
00:55:57,315 --> 00:56:01,710
No, come no closer. I must not be so near 
a creature of the outdoor woods.

557
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:08,244
Away with your filth.
- My filth? My filth?!

558
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:09,244
Here we go.

559
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:15,862
I'm sick and tired of everybody taking one look at me
and running away cos they think I'm filthy.

560
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:23,469
Well, I got news for you, I din't get all prim and preen
to have some overfed papa's puffball tell me he's too good for me.

561
00:56:23,568 --> 00:56:27,983
I got make-up on my butt, dude.
And you don't even wanna know about the cork.

562
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:32,362
Stop, no one has ever spoken to me like that.

563
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:37,800
It's bold. I like it.

564
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:44,969
Well believe me, there's more where that came from,
puffball.

565
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:50,152
Alright team, let's boogie.
- Your essence is over-powering.

566
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:54,405
What do you mean by that?
- It is your eyes.

567
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:59,793
They are luminous.
- Luminous? Damn.

568
00:56:59,994 --> 00:57:06,353
You know, this is the part where I blacked out.
Do the little shoes and cars actually get into the house?

569
00:57:07,626 --> 00:57:13,302
So, you got a name?
- Yes, it's a persian name of cos, I am persian.

570
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:20,860
I was born, Prince Tigerias Mammoeth Shabbas.
- Ooh, that's a mouthful. Can I just call you Tiger?

571
00:57:26,597 --> 00:57:30,422
Animals we're in the house.

572
00:57:46,427 --> 00:57:49,052
Ok, stations everybody. Let's boogie.

573
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,001
No grip, no grip, no grip.

574
00:57:52,784 --> 00:57:55,340
Hammy, that's called a warpath.

575
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,411
That hurt.

576
00:58:08,713 --> 00:58:12,795
What is that?
- That's just the sound of my heart. Can't you hear it?

577
00:58:19,097 --> 00:58:21,110
This way, this way.

578
00:58:26,862 --> 00:58:29,659
Ok, we're good.
Go back to work.

579
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:48,543
Yes, we're gonna make it.
- My father, he had an exceptionaly flat face.

580
00:58:48,643 --> 00:58:53,251
It was so beautiful, he could barely breathe.
- Fascinating.

581
00:58:53,353 --> 00:58:58,623
Inside we have a multi-level, climbing,
tri-carpet, come, I'll show you.

582
00:58:58,726 --> 00:59:00,891
No! I haven't told you about
my life.

583
00:59:00,989 --> 00:59:03,456
Good, good. Going great.

584
00:59:05,228 --> 00:59:08,936
What is that?
- That is what get the humans out of bed in the morning.

585
00:59:12,001 --> 00:59:14,936
Where'd she go?
- Get down, stay down.

586
00:59:42,393 --> 00:59:45,331
Come on, we gotta go
before she comes back.

587
00:59:46,697 --> 00:59:49,612
No, not without those Spuddies.
- What?

588
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:53,213
Lou, Penny, check the TV.
Heather, keep an eye on that human.

589
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,284
I'm on it, RJ.
- No, Heather, wait.

590
00:59:55,572 --> 01:00:00,190
The tingle.
Hey RJ, the wagon's full. Let's get out of here.

591
01:00:00,293 --> 01:00:02,969
Hang on Vincent. This'll only take a second.
- Vincent?

592
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:03,972
Where?
- Whose Vincent?

593
01:00:05,132 --> 01:00:08,507
Ohh..Verne, Vincent. Simple slip of the bear.
The tongue!

594
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:12,552
Uhh, just bare with me, is what I meant to say.

595
01:00:13,268 --> 01:00:15,612
There's no bear.

596
01:00:19,047 --> 01:00:22,094
Lights fading, limbs growing...

597
01:00:36,335 --> 01:00:39,893
There's a dead white rat on my staircase.

598
01:00:43,677 --> 01:00:47,858
I thought you were dead.
- I learnt from the best dad.

599
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,014
That's my girl.

600
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:54,391
Come to papa.
- We gotta hurry. We don't have much time.

601
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:56,478
What's going on, RJ?
- Nothing.

602
01:00:56,577 --> 01:00:59,766
Well then, let's get out of here cos we have what we need.
- No we don't.

603
01:00:59,898 --> 01:01:02,271
What are you talking about,
we have more then enough!

604
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:06,431
Listen, I have about this small to hand over 
that wagon load of food to a homicidal bear.

605
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,766
And this Spuddies are on the menu,
or I will be. Now, let go off my tail.

606
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:14,572
What?
- Let go.

607
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:25,751
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Stella, Stella...where are you going?

608
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:40,485
Look, it's not you, it won't work ok. Because I'm a...
- Skunk!!!

609
01:01:40,585 --> 01:01:44,010
Yea, that.
Sorry you have to see this...

610
01:01:44,045 --> 01:01:45,286
Fire-in-the-hole!

611
01:01:52,652 --> 01:01:57,193
This smell doesn't bother you?
- No, this face was meant for beauty.

612
01:01:57,295 --> 01:02:01,722
I cannot smell a thing.
- You can't smell.

613
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:11,094
To the door. Go, go, go.

614
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,382
Run!
-This way.

615
01:02:17,998 --> 01:02:21,186
Let's party.
Party!

616
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,699
Flee, my love!

617
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,936
Run!
That way. Outside.

618
01:02:34,353 --> 01:02:37,487
Buenos días, reptile.

619
01:02:42,523 --> 01:02:45,539
You've just been, verminated.

620
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:51,639
Woah, you stink.
- That's because you let them into my, house...

621
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:58,376
Stop your honking.
This little guys will be disposed off quickly and humanely.

622
01:02:58,478 --> 01:03:02,369
Not humanely.
As inhumanely as possible.

623
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,831
It was a pleasure, doing business with you, mdm.

624
01:03:24,494 --> 01:03:28,766
What's he gonna do to us, mama?
- I don't know.

625
01:03:28,864 --> 01:03:36,362
I don't wanna die, dad. Not for real.
- There, there, we'll be ok.

626
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:46,052
You were right about him, Verne.
We should have listened, sorry there.

627
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:51,311
I knew we couldn't trust him.

628
01:03:51,315 --> 01:03:56,215
I got us into this,
I should have known better.

629
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:13,068
So, I was on my way down to kill you.
But, I stopped to watch the show and I have to say..

630
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:19,936
...that, right there, is a thing of beauty.

631
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:31,853
That is the most vicious, deceitful, self-serving
thing, I've ever seen. Classy, RJ.

632
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:37,001
You take the food, and they take the fall.

633
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:47,152
You keep this up, you're gonna end up just like me.
Having everything you ever wanted.

634
01:04:47,835 --> 01:04:52,344
But, I already had that.
- What? Them?

635
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:57,565
Who're you kidding? You said it yourself.
You're a family of one.

636
01:04:57,668 --> 01:05:02,434
Always will be.
It's how guys like you and me survive.

637
01:05:02,536 --> 01:05:07,853
So, a few saps got hurt in the process,
that's life.

638
01:05:07,956 --> 01:05:10,635
Trust me, you don't need them.

639
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:16,119
Actually, I do.

640
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:21,155
And right now, they really need me.

641
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,856
So, I really need this.

642
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,931
There goes the bag again.
- Are you ok?

643
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:53,652
You, sorry...
- Woah, Stella, this is a rescue. I'm rescuing you.

644
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:56,920
I'm gonna gas you so hard,
your grandchildren will stink.

645
01:05:56,922 --> 01:05:59,449
What's that?
Hair?

646
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,822
Ear?

647
01:06:01,728 --> 01:06:03,277
Ohh, bear!

648
01:06:13,786 --> 01:06:17,985
We can drive!
- It's just like, Auto Homicide 3.

649
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:27,244
Let me in.
Verkeerde knopje!

650
01:06:28,505 --> 01:06:30,014
Please, select destination.

651
01:06:30,016 --> 01:06:32,920
Take us home!
Take us to the log.

652
01:06:33,021 --> 01:06:36,362
Previous destination selected.
Make a legal U-turn.

653
01:06:41,824 --> 01:06:45,056
Hammy, let me in!
- Not listening to RJ. Lalalalaa....

654
01:06:46,016 --> 01:06:48,831
Kids! Lose that bear!
- What weapons do we have?

655
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:51,744
We've got a hammer.
- Cool.

656
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,577
Thank you. Yes, yes..

657
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:03,891
Let me in.
- No, ringtailed saboteur.

658
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:06,831
He's just trying to help, just let him in.
- After what he did to us?!

659
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:10,994
But he came back.
- And he brought a bear.

660
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:19,523
Hey, no fighting while we're driving.
- We will turn this van around if you don't stop.

661
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:23,266
He started it.
- I'm telling you, he's just trying to help us.

662
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:28,360
But Verne, you're the one who always say trust your tail.
- But, it's not tingling.

663
01:07:29,552 --> 01:07:31,476
Why din't you say so.

664
01:07:37,456 --> 01:07:39,103
You're dead, RJ.

665
01:07:39,976 --> 01:07:41,635
And your friends are next.

666
01:07:41,737 --> 01:07:42,639
Look out.

667
01:07:44,052 --> 01:07:46,516
Make an immediate left turn.

668
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:51,068
Bonus points!

669
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:12,619
High score!

670
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,247
You have arrived.

671
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:48,154
Come on, we gotta go.
- Die oude Jazz-dance blessure.

672
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:04,145
Lou? Penny? The kids here? Hammy?
- Big clown.

673
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:22,671
A weed-hacker!

674
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:32,895
Show your little rat faces.
Stay in the woods where you belong!

675
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:43,368
You guys wanna party, do you?
Alright then, let's party.

676
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:51,246
Kids! 
Hey, Lou, look out. Down!

677
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,219
Dat is de druppel!
Verne, get everybody out of here.

678
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:58,827
I'll distract him.
- Are you crazy? They'll kill you.

679
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:01,568
Look, I'm the one he wants.
Just take care of your family, Verne.

680
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:05,469
I intend to, whole family.
There's gotta be something we can do.

681
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:06,586
There's no time!

682
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:22,777
Hey Vincent, you were right.
With a Spuddie enough, just isn't enough.

683
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,930
Now Hammy, go, go.

684
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:57,978
- That's the...
- The D-Pelter Turbo, prepare for alot of stinging.

685
01:12:37,862 --> 01:12:40,528
You are a genius, my boy
- Ohh, Thank..youu...

686
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:47,755
And Verne, don't you ever fix this shell.
- Yea, glad it's working for you.

687
01:12:47,854 --> 01:12:49,805
Take it off. Give it back.

688
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:53,390
Here we go,
it's the rockies for you, Smokey.

689
01:12:53,493 --> 01:12:59,496
U do realise that is a D-Pelter Turbo?
- Officer, please, it was that verminator. He sold it to me.

690
01:12:59,595 --> 01:13:02,572
This has nothing to do with me.
- Hey, it was in your yard...

691
01:13:02,572 --> 01:13:05,430
your name is written on the contract,
so you can tell it to the judge.

692
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:09,171
No, it's not my fault. Let go of me.
I can't be arrested.

693
01:13:09,277 --> 01:13:12,020
I'm president of the Homeowners Association.

694
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:14,617
She's getting away.

695
01:13:24,189 --> 01:13:25,395
Play?

696
01:13:38,363 --> 01:13:39,912
Over here, Tiger.

697
01:13:43,095 --> 01:13:48,063
So this is the outdoor woods?
I like it.

698
01:13:50,506 --> 01:13:58,363
You know RJ, just for the record.
If you told us that all that food you were trying to get is to pay back an angry bear.

699
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:03,154
We would have given it to you. - Really?
Yeah, that's what families do.

700
01:14:03,255 --> 01:14:07,877
They look out for each other.
- I've never really had anything like that.

701
01:14:07,978 --> 01:14:13,813
Believe me, this is the gateway.
This is the gateway to the good life.

702
01:14:13,814 --> 01:14:18,304
Really wish you would have told me that sooner.
- Yeah, well, that's bad communication.

703
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:22,845
It's, also what families do.
So, what do you say? Wanna be part of it?

704
01:14:28,212 --> 01:14:29,212
Come here.

705
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:37,220
Welcome to the family.
- Grouphug.

706
01:14:39,505 --> 01:14:42,805
What a first week of spring.
Wait a minute...

707
01:14:42,904 --> 01:14:45,506
that means there's only
267 days left till winter.

708
01:14:45,608 --> 01:14:47,247
What we gonna do for food?

709
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,394
Yes, Hammy.

710
01:14:51,496 --> 01:14:52,987
I filled the log.

711
01:14:56,305 --> 01:15:10,939
Look! Look! I found my nuts!!!
