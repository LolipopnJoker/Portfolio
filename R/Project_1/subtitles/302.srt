If the product of two terms

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,870
is zero then common sense says

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,117
at least one of the two terms
has to be zero to start with.

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,192
So if you move all the
terms over to one side,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,391
you can put the quadratics
into a form

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,708
that can be factored...

35

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,110
Just that...
Who the hell is he?

172
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,316
Paul Stafford,
our lead engineer, Mr. Webb.

173
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
I think what
he meant to say...

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,240
is that speculation, at least
on our side of the equation...

175
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,311
by definition can be...

176
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,118
just a little dangerous.

177
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,315
Dangerous?

178
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,948
You know what's dangerous,
Mr. Stafford?

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,156
Inaction and indecision.

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,950
The Russians
have a spy satellite

181
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
lapping the planet,

182
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,270
taking pictures
of God knows what!

183
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,789
The President is demanding
an immediate response.

184
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,520
No more delay.
Alan Shepard, John Glenn,

185
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,776
your uncle Bob,
it doesn't matter.

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,869
Get us up there, Harrison.

187
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,235
We can't justify
a space program

188
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,675
that doesn't put
anything in space.

How'd that feel
in there, Paul?

191
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,631
You think you enlightened
the administrator?

192
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Hmm?

193
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,870
No, he didn't look
enlightened to me.

194
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,992
He look enlightened to you, Sam?

195
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,229
Not particularly.

196
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,469
And just so you know,

197
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,136
he's not wrong about
what he said in there.

198
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,559
You know that, right?

199
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,432
Because now that
they can get up there,

200
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,669
a bomb will follow.

201
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,675
It's what happens
to all our good ideas.

202
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,071
I imagine theirs too.
Where's...

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,714
Where's the machine?

204
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Any day now,
Mr. Harrison.

205
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,157
Any day now.
Yes, sir.

206
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,669
What's it called?
The initials.

207
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,034
The IBM.

208
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,719

209
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,553

The area closest to the boosters

348
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,754

349
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,429
Excuse me, ma'am.

350
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,636
Mr. Harrison's computer
reporting.

351
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,479
Take the desk in the back.
I'll get you work in a bit.

352
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,037
Mr. Harrison won't warm up
to you. Don't expect it.

353
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,520
Do your work,
keep your head down.

354
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Thank you.

355
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,512
Go on. Get settled.

356
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Paul.

357
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,238
Why are we still
losing shingles

358
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,554
off the heat shield?

359
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,075
We're working with a prototype
of the capsule, Al.

360
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,056
Its lid is one third the
size of what it's going...

361
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
<font color="#808080">AL:</font> I get that.

362
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,673
So, what do we do with our
million dollar fan, Karl?

363
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,110
Turn it down?
No, Al. I don't think...

364
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,669
It was a joke.

365
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,917
Paul, if the heat shield
comes off...

366
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
what do you think happens
to our astronaut?

367
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I know.

368
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
So we're gonna come up
with a solve, right?

369
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Yes, sir.
We're working on it.

370
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,678
Ruth, what's the status
on that computer?

371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,831
She's right behind you,
Mr. Harrison.

372
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,349
Does she handle
Analytic Geometry?

373
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,398
Absolutely.
And she speaks.

374
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,788
Yes, sir. I do.

375
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,558
Which one?
Both.

376
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,199
Geometry and speaking.

377
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,436
Ruth, get me the...

378
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
You think you...

379
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,056
You think you can find me
the Frenet frame

380
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
for this data?

381
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,514
Using the Gram-Schmidt...

382
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,676
Orthogonalization algorithm.
Yes, sir.

383
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,479
I prefer it over
Euclidean coordinates.

384
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,039
Okay, good.

385
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Good, then I'm gonna need
it by the end of the day.

386
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,275
Yes.

387
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,589
I'm also gonna ask you

388
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,760
to check
Mr. Stafford's math

389
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,273
as well as others' on this floor

390
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,429
from time to time.

391
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I can handle that, Al.

392
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,637
I'm sure you can, Paul.
I'm sure they all can.

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,279
But if that were the case

394
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,976
shingles wouldn't be flying
off the heat shield,

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
now would they?

396
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,877
Excuse me, could I have
everyone's attention

397
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,029
for a moment?

398
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,639
Thank you.

399
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,799
Just to be clear...

400
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,838
in 14 days, the Mercury Seven
will be here for training.

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,833
And I have no doubt in my mind
that they're going to be

402
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,831
asking us questions
about our work.

403
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,119
I think that's pretty reasonable

404
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,236
given we're putting a human
on top of a missile,

405
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
shooting him into space,

406
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,953

done before.

409
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,309
everything we do between now
and then is gonna matter.

410
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,552
It's gonna matter
to their wives...

411
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,273
to their children.

412
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,080
I believe it's gonna matter
to the whole damn country.

413
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,109
So this Space Task Group
will be as advertised.

No, sir.

a National Guard unit

668
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,234
right here in Hampton.

669
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,673
Can I get a hallelujah in here?

670
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,831
Hallelujah!

671
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,479
I just don't understand.

672
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,633
I don't understand it.

673
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,440
I don't wanna talk
about this again, okay?

674
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,193
A female engineer?

675
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
A female engineer?

676
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,035
We're Negro, baby.

677
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,480
Ain't no such thing.
Understand it.

678
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,953
It's not like that
there, Levi.

679
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,439
You can't apply for freedom.

680
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,319
Freedom is never granted
to the oppressed.

681
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,993
It's got
to be demanded. Taken.

682
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,991
Stop quoting your slogans at me.

683
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,795
There is more than one way
to achieve something.

684
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I don't want any greens.

685
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,956
Hey. I tell you
about interrupting?

686
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,792
Here. Try this, baby.

687
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Yes.

688
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,757
You're gonna eat
them greens, too.

689
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,796
Kids need
to eat their vegetables.

690
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,678
You'd know that
if you was ever home.

691
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,951
You better settle down,
Levi Jackson.

692
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,792
Unless you want
this female's mind,

693
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,871
right here,
in front of everybody.

694
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,393
All I'm saying...

695
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,312
don't play the fool.

696
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,311
I don't wanna
see you get hurt.

697
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,391
NASA's never ever
given you guys your due.

698
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,913
Having a couple
of extra degrees

699
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,149
ain't gonna change that.

700
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,830
Civil rights
ain't always civil.

701
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,152
I don't want
any greens either.

702
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,355
No lip, little miss.

703
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,040
Your brother gets them,
and so do you.

704
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,395
I hear he's planning
on staying in the area.

705
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,751
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's good for him.

706
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,388
Katherine, go find
your way over there.

707
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,597
That Colonel Jim
is a tall glass of water.

708
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,034
That he is.

709
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,754
Tall, strong, commanding.

710
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,195
And I bet he's like that
day and night.

711

712

Please have some shame.

713
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,874
I will not.

714
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,068
Hmm, I think he's
smiling over here.

715
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,434
At you.

716
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,108
Well I'm not smiling back.

Yes, you are.
Oh, child.

718
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,151

00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
Hello, Colonel.

725
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,394
I'm Dorothy Vaughan.

726
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,696
That's Mary Jackson.
I believe you met her husband, Levi.

727
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,233
Yes, ma'am.
Good to meet y'all.

728
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,753
And Mrs. Katherine Goble.

729
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,717
She's not married.
She's a widow...

730
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,075
with three beautiful
little girls.

731
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
So well behaved.

732
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,550
Angels on earth is what
we like to call them.

733
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,392
Dorothy, slice of pie?

734
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,073
I'd love one.

735
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,719
Excuse me.

736
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,056
You already have
a slice of pie...

737
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Uh-huh.

738
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,399
I was just, uh, fixing my
three babies some plates...

739
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,794
Let me help you.

740
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,988
Sure.

741
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,151
Fruit salad.
Mmm-hmm.

742
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,518
Pastor mentioned you're
a computer at NASA.

743
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Yes.

744
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,993
What's that entail?

745
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Oh.

746
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,911
We calculate
the mathematics necessary

747
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,640

for the space program.

748

That's pretty heady stuff.

749
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,515
Yes, it is.

That's not what I mean.

753
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,479
What do you mean?

754
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,591
I'm just surprised
that something so...

755
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,714

Mmm-hmm.

756
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,313
Mr. Johnson.

757
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,635
If I were you,
I'd quit talking right now.

758
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,028
I didn't mean
no disrespect.

759
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,554
I will have you know

760
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,790
I was the first
Negro female student

761
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,155
at West Virginia University
Graduate School.

762
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,108
On any given day...

763
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,390
I analyze the manometer levels

764
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,948
for air displacement,
friction, and velocity

765
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,594
and compute
over 10,000 calculations

766
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,398
by cosine, square root...

767
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,596
and, lately, analytic geometry.

768
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
By hand.

769
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,760
There are 20 bright,
highly capable

770
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,677

in the West Computing Group.

771
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,314
And we're proud to be doing
our part for the country.

772
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
So, yes.

773
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,709
They let women do some things
at NASA, Mr. Johnson.

774
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,675
And it's not because
we wear skirts.

775
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,231
It's because
we wear glasses.

Mmm.

788
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,711
And handsome must be
a requirement too.

789
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,599
How could you possibly be
ogling these white men?

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
It's equal rights.

already been confirmed

by two engineers in this
department and myself.

825
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,756
This is more or less

You have one, we make it two.
Make it double, okay?

827
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,197
We gotta get it.
Just make it happen.

828
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,235
No one thought to measure
these things?

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,432
Since you made the trip...

842
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,716
you can take that batch
over there.

843
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,277
Sure thing, Mrs. Mitchell.

844
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,475
You need something else?
Yes, ma'am.

845
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,976
I was wondering if you know
what they're building

846
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
over in the tech wing.

847
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,950
It's called an IBM.

848
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,599
A mainframe machine.

849
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,833
Apparently, it can
do our calculations

850
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,000
in a fraction of the time.

851
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
Hmm.

852
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,952
I guess that's good for NASA.

853
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,476
Hurry on, now.
Best if you do it in one trip.

Hi.

858
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,513
Is that correct?

859
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
Yeah.

860
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,795
Whose work is that?

861
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,871

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,472
Katherine Goble, sir.

00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Hello.
Hi.

864
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,456
<font color="#808080">PAUL: </font> How did you know
the Redstone

865
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,038
couldn't support orbital flight?

866
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,376
That's classified information.

867
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
It's top secret.

868
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,235
It's no secret why the
Redstone tests keep failing.

869
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,879
It's fine
for sub-orbital flight

870
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,076
but it can't handle
the weight of the capsule

871
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
and push it into space.

872
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,393
Numbers don't lie.

873
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,311
And you figured
all that out with this?

874
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,911
Half the data is redacted.

875
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,156
But what's there tells a story
if you read between the lines.

876
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,000
The distance from launch
to orbit, we know.

877
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,354
Redstone mass, we know.

878
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,396
Mercury capsule weight, we know.

879
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,398
And the speeds are there
in the data.

880
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,238
You did the math.

881
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,640
Yes, sir.

882
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,271
I looked beyond.

883
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,749
How do you know
about the Atlas rocket?

884
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,751
That's not math.

885
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,989
That data is not here.

886
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,792
Like you said, it's classified.

887
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,757
I held it up to the light.

888
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,279
You held it up
to the light?

889
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,509
Yes, sir.

890
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Well, there it is.

891
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Mmm-hmm.

892
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,280
Atlas.

893
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,269
What's your name?

894
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,953
Katherine Goble.

895
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,633
Are you a spy, Katherine?

896
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Am I what?

897
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,040
I said, are you a Russian spy?

898
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,473
No, sir.

899
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,993
I'm not Russian.

900
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,158
She's not Russian, sir.

901
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,791
All right then, we have
nothing to lose here.

902
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,016
Give her everything she needs

903
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,296
to work on Shepard's
trajectories.

904
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,390
Without redaction.
Are we clear on that?

905
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,834
Are we sure about this?

906
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,040
What's the issue, Paul?

907
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,633
You heard her.

908
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,800
She's not a spy.

909
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,232
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

910
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,075
You know what I think's
a good idea? Darker ink.

911
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,520
I think darker ink's
a good idea.

pass it along?

913
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Yes, sir.

That position is available
to any qualified applicant.

935
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,078
Right. Except, you don't have
the educational requirements.

that Russian cosmonaut,
Yuri Gagarin,

1084
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,315

the first man in space.

1092

And after what I just saw,

1111
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,479
I'm sure everyone's probably
anxious to just go home.

1112
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,229
Before we do, I just
have to ask a question.

1113
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,717
The same one

1114
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,656
I've been asking myself
all the way over here...

1115
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,715
which is...

1116
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,079
How the hell did
we find ourself

1117
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,077

in a two-man race?

1118
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,880

00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,880

1120
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,880
And I think Glenn said it
pretty well.

1121
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,120
They're just outworking us.

1122
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,430
The reason
I have to think that

1123
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,696
is because I refuse
to believe

1124
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,278
that the Russians
are smarter than us

1125
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,953
or that they have
more technology,

1126
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,553
or that they care more.

1127
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,111
But I don't know.
Is that possible?

1128
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,634
Is it possible
that it actually

1129
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,233
means more to them?

1130
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,911
We're in the fight
of our lives, people.

1131
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,389
We're not on
some epic joy ride.

1132
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,232

1136

there's only two things you
need to know going forward.

1137
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,593

working late,

1138

that's gonna be
a fact of life.

1139
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,599

it's gonna take

an all-white high school.

1410
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
It's unheard of.

1411
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,192
Yeah. Unheard of.

1412
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,560

sat on top of a rocket,

1413
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,830

had ever touched space.

1414

you can bring

1487
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Let me say first...

1488
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,480
discovery is never
just for the sake

1489
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,560
of discovery, gentlemen...

1490
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,750
but for the sake
of human survival.

1491
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,635
And it will always
come with a risk.

1492
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,310
Whoever gets there first
will make the rules.

1493
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,471
That's been true
of every civilization.

1494
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,639
And so, I think
the bigger question

1495
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,239
for this body
to consider is...

1496
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,995
who do you want calling
the shots in space?

1497
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,631
We have to know
what's out there, Senator.

1498
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,879
We have to touch the stars,

1499
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,269
if only to ensure
our own survival.

1500
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,271
And only a man can do that.

1501
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,559

1503
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,315
Because he has to tell us
what he saw.

1504
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,871
The Redstone rocket
went straight up.

1505
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,312
But the capsule
didn't have enough speed

1506
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,920
to go into orbit,
so it came back down.

1507
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,110
Essentially a triangle.
Earth, sub-orbit, Earth.

1508
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,872
That math was known.

1509
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,548
That took Shepard,
took Grissom.

1510
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,913
That cannot take Glenn.

1511
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,472
Now, the Atlas rocket...

1512
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,077
that can push us into orbit.

1513
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,357
Goes up, delivers the capsule
into an elliptical orbit.

1514
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,958
Earth's gravity
keeps pulling at it

1515
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,759
but it's going so fast,
it keeps missing the Earth.

1516
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,672
That's how it stays in orbit.

1517
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,115
Now, getting it back down...

1518
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,552
that's the math
we don't know.

1519
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,640
Yes, Katherine.

1520
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,473
So the capsule will spin
around the Earth forever

1521
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,551
because there's nothing
to slow it down?

1522
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,280
That's right.

1523
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,398
Slowing it down at precisely
the right moment,

1524
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,152
at precisely
the right amount,

1525
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,320
that's the task.

1526
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,480
Yes, Katherine.

1527
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,076
So it needs to move
from an elliptical orbit...

1528
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,670
to a parabolic orbit.

1529
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,880
Yes.

1530
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,711
That's the "Go/No-go."

1531
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,836
Now at this point,
it's a pin head.

1532
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,993
We bring him in too soon...

1533
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,798
He burns up
on reentry.

1534
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,188
That's right.

1535
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,679
We bring him in
too late...

1536
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,432
he's pushed
out of Earth's gravity.

1537
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,910
And any changes to mass,
weight, speed, time...

1538
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,436
distance, friction,
or a puff of wind...

1539
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,396
would alter the "Go/No-go."

1540
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,518
And we start
our calculations over.

1541
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,920
Yes.

1542
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,435
So we need to be able to
choose this reentry point.

1543
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,592
Now this "Go/No-go,"
this has to be exact.

1544
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,795
Sam.

1545
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,556
These are the latest
Redstone numbers

1546
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,959
in current capsule data.

1547
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,678
Obviously, we know
the launch spot.

1548
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,760
Thanks.

1549
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,592
A Pentagon briefing
should illuminate

1550
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,398
where the Navy
needs the recovery zone.

1551
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,431
Then we work backwards
from there.

1552
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,715
And the rest is on us,
so let's get to work.

1553
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,440
Uh, Mr. Stafford.

1554
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,760
What, Katherine?

1555
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,153
If I could
attend the briefings,

1556
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,390
I'd be more useful
to the project.

1557
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,391
Pentagon briefings
are closed door.

1558
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,393
Yes, but if we don't
have the information

1559
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,799
of the changes...

1560
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:51,960
we can't keep up.

1561
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,456
I need those changes
as they occur.

1562
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,600
As you said,
it's a pin head.

1563
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,512
Katherine, that's the job.

1564
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,238
You asked for this assignment,

1565
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,390
so just calculate
with what you have.

1566
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,516
Or we'll find
someone who can.

1567
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,275
Okay.

1568
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,917
Atta girl.

You can't be in here.

01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,795
Who are you?

1571
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,871
I'm with

Dorothy Vaughan, sir.

1573
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,238
This is a very delicate
piece of equipment.

1574
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,176
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

1575
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,430
BILL: Uh-huh.
Bill, we've got numbers.

1576
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,518
What kind of numbers?

1577
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,993
Well, I'll be.

1578
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,149
What's your name again?

1579
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,274
Dorothy Vaughan.

1580
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,913
Dorothy Vaughan.

1581
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,634
Sir, the parameters
for Friendship 7.

1582
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,393
Oh, this is all moot.

1583
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,391
We're altering the
window on the capsule.

1584
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,040
When did this happen?
Six minutes ago.

1585
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,639
The math is changing.
Start over.

1586
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,076
Sir, if I could attend the briefings,
I could stay current...

1587
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,719
Katherine, we have
been through this.

1588
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,880
It is not possible.

1589
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,616
There is no protocol
for women attending.

1590
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,789
There's no protocol
for a man

1591
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,160
circling the Earth either, sir.

1592
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,839
Okay. That is just
the way things are.

1593
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,593
Colonel Glenn's
launch coordinates,

1594
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,160
accounting for
the window change, sir.

1595
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,508
I have told you this.

1596
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,120
Computers don't
author reports. Fix it.

1597
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,356
Those are my calculations.
My name should be on it.

1598
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,431
That is not the way
this works.

1599
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,955
Paul. What's
happening here?

1600
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,270
Mr. Harrison, I would like
to attend today's briefing.

1601
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,509
And why is that?

1602
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:19,359
Sir, the data changes so fast.
The capsule changes.

1603
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,959
The weight and the landing zones

1604
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,553
are all changing, every day.

1605
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,950
I do my work, you attend
these briefings,

1606
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,040
I have to start over.

1607
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,511
Colonel Glenn launches
in a few weeks.

1608
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,600
We don't have the math
figured out yet.

1609
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,079
Why is it she can't attend?

1610
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,456
Because she doesn't
have clearance, Al.

1611
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,913
I cannot do
my work effectively

1612
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,360
if I do not have
all of the data

1613
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,635
and all of the information
as soon as it's available.

1614
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,456
I need to be in that room,
hearing what you hear.

1615
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,152
Pentagon briefings
are not for civilians.

1616
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,416
It requires
the highest clearance.

1617
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,456
I feel like
I'm the best person

1618
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,640
to present my calculations...

1619
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,736
You're not gonna let this go, are you?
No, I am not.

1620
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,716
And she is a woman.
There is no protocol

1621
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,936
for a woman
attending these meetings.

1622
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,279
Okay, I get that part, Paul.

1623
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,833
But within these walls,

1624
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,319
who makes the rules?

1625
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,993
You, sir. You are the boss.

1626
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,799
You just have
to act like one. Sir.

1627
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,309
You keep quiet.

1628
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,269

1634
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,875
with our Trajectory
and Launch Window division.

1635
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,195
Her work is pertinent
to today's proceedings.

1636
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,440
Come on.

1637
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,874
Wanna get her a chair?

1638
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,856
We have a
confirmed launch window...

1639
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,200
Get her a chair, please.
Yes, sir.

1640
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,336
We have a
confirmed launch window

1641
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,475
for Friendship 7.

1642
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,800
Let's discuss a landing zone.

1643
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,669
The Navy needs
a singular landing zone.

1644
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,115
20 miles square is what we
can service for retrieval.

1645
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,320
Outside of that

1646
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,198
we risk the capsule's recovery.

1647
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,635
We'd like three possible
recovery areas.

1648
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,160
We can't cover
half the damn ocean.

1649
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,955
With all due respect,

1650
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,798
our capsule's being
altered daily.

1651
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,995
We're orbiting the Earth
at what speed now?

1652
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Uh...

1653
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:17,754
17,544 miles per hour...

1654
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,751
at the time the rocket
delivers the capsule

1655
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,074
into low space orbit.

1656
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,360
Well, that's one hell
of a speeding ticket.

01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:29,880
Okay.

1659
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,353
So we have
the vehicle's speed,

1660
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,555
the launch window...

1661
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,358
and for argument's sake,
the landing zone

1662
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,714
is the Bahamas.

1663
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,598
Should be enough
to figure the "Go/No-go"?

1664
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,239
Yeah, in theory, sir.

1665
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,992
We need to be past
theory at this point.

1666
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,838
We'll be able to
calculate a "Go/No-go"

1667
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,433
with that information.

1668
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,511

20,530,372 feet...

1689

It's beautiful.

1865

She and my father
were married for...

For 52 years.

1867
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,550
Figure it's about as lucky
a ring as you can get.

1868
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,470
The day I met you,
I called my mother

1869
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,712
and I said, "Mom, I met the
woman I want to marry."

1870
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,074
What'd she say?

1871
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,776
She said, "She must be
something, Jimmy."

1872
01:36:58,800 --> 01:36:59,800
"Really something."

1873
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,069
Then what'd you say?

1874
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,468
I said, "No."

1875
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,557
"She's more than something."

1876
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,233
"She's everything."

1877
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:09,080
Now...

1878
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,478

more romantic.

your girls as well.

No, there's nothing wrong.

So we won't be
running backups here.

1916
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,313
And truth be told, we can't
keep up with that IBM anyhow.

1917
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,511
Long story short,
we no longer need

Affirmative, CAPCOM.

Al, we need
to get him down now.

2163
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,798
He could burn up
on re-entry.

2164
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,591
Come on, babies.

2165
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,875
There is a man in space.

That is a negative, CAPCOM.

2175
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,277
This poses a grave danger
to the mission.

2176

If the heat shield's loose...

2182
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,276
the retro-package straps
might hold it in place.

2183

Will that work?

2184
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,312
It will work.

2185
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,040

reaches the "Go/No-go" point.

It will work.

2187

Al, he has
to override the.05G.

2188
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:21,520
Do it.

2190
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,033
we're recommending
that the retro-package not...

2191

I repeat, not be jettisoned.

2192
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,314
This means that you will have
to override the. 05G switch.

2204
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,712
The heat is simply
too overpowering.

2205
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,550
A malfunction in the automatic

2206
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,991
is causing the spacecraft
to yaw in a skid-like fashion.
