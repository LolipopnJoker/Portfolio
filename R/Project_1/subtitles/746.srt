I'm thinking
of changing my name.

352
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:21,902
[Elton] Yeah, great.

353
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,804
I'm thinking of changing it
to Elton Dean.

354
00:25:25,405 --> 00:25:26,737
But that's my name.

355
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:29,309
Yeah, I know.
What do you think?

356
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:31,511

[exhales] Um... all right.

393
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:41,040
See if there's anything interesting
in this one and set it to music.

394
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,648
Okay.
Well, I'll see you soon.

395
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,450

00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,749
- Yeah.
- Hi.

403
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:27,319
Well, that's my stage name.

404
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:31,157
You can tell me your real name when
we get to know each other better.

405
00:28:31,524 --> 00:28:32,559
Right.

406
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,327
- Uh...
- Um...

407
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,262
- [Elton] I was thinking... Sorry.
- [Bernie] Have you ever... Sorry.

408
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,232
No, no, please.
After you.

409
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,003
- I like your lyrics.
- Thank you.

410
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:48,340
Yeah, I got the tape
you sent. It's great.

- Thanks.

Hang on. Don't bother with that one.
That wasn't supposed to be in there.

413
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:58,316
- That's sent by mistake.
- No, no, that's really good.

414
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:00,285
I wrote a tune to it.

415
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,952
- Yeah, I...
- "Border Song"?

416
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:06,623
Yeah. I read it and I could
hear the whole tune in my head.

417
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,860
It was all there, I could see all the
notes, and I just had to get it out.

418
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:13,265
It was like my fingers couldn't work
fast enough to keep up with my brain.

419
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:16,900
Do you ever get anything
like that?

420
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:19,205
Uh... not really, no.

421
00:29:19,905 --> 00:29:22,106
But I can write more
for you, though, Elton.

422
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:26,010
- I'll just send them down to you.
- Great. That'll be good.

423
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,146
Great.

424

425
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,755
Cool. Yeah, that sounds
like a cowboy name.

426
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:39,358
Yeah, all I ever...

427
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,725
All I ever wanted to be
was a cowboy, you see.

428

country and western music?

429

- Yeah.

Laredo" by Marty Robbins?

We'll make him the singer.

Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf.
Elton is... He sings the songs.

No, we live with our mums.

479

So I do the writing,

480
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,423
I send it down to him,
and then he adds the music.

It was the best night ever.

[Doug] So, you want something to drink?
Get these guys whatever they want.

705

01:06:58,312 --> 01:07:00,648
this is your brother, Reggie.

1029
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:02,016
Half brother.

1030
01:07:02,483 --> 01:07:04,452
Not actually called
Reggie anymore.

1031
01:07:05,786 --> 01:07:06,786
Hmm.

1032
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,055
I thought maybe
once I'm back from touring,

1033
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:11,026
you and I could
get together, if you like.

1034
01:07:11,425 --> 01:07:14,495
I could get you some tickets
to my next concert.

1035
01:07:15,229 --> 01:07:17,431
Not really my thing.

1036
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:21,969
Is it true
you're worth 25 million pound?

1037
01:07:22,403 --> 01:07:24,536
Do you know,
I don't actually know.

1038
01:07:24,538 --> 01:07:27,108
They're really
proud of you. Mmm.

1039
01:07:27,742 --> 01:07:30,478
Yeah, we've even got
some of your records.

1040
01:07:30,978 --> 01:07:34,315
Why don't you go and get the album?
Grab us a pen.

1041
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,692
You probably get asked this all the
time, but would you...

1042
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:46,259
Would you mind signing this?

1043
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:51,297
Yeah, of course.

1044
01:07:56,937 --> 01:07:59,874
Oh, no. Would you
make it out to Arthur?

1045
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:03,310
He's one of the blokes
from work.

1046
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:05,279
Yeah, he's a big fan.

1047
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,581
- Is he?
- Mm-hmm.

1048
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:17,858
Perfect.

1049
01:08:18,491 --> 01:08:20,826
[rubbing hands, sighs]

1050
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:21,862
Right.

1051
01:08:23,296 --> 01:08:26,634
Well, looks like things worked out
really well second time around, Dad.

1052
01:08:27,568 --> 01:08:28,769
- I suppose they have.
- Mmm.

1053
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:31,905
'Cause, you know,
not everybody gets a second chance.

1054
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,047
[Stanley] The boys loved
meeting a real-life pop star.

1055
01:08:40,547 --> 01:08:42,615
Sure. Thanks, Dad.

1056
01:08:43,017 --> 01:08:44,051
Bye.

1057
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:48,887
- When I grow up, Dad...
- [Stanley] Get inside.

1058
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:51,659
What are you doing
without your shoes on?

1059
01:08:52,593 --> 01:08:54,428
You're gonna be a draftsman.

1060
01:08:56,162 --> 01:08:57,497
Back inside.

1061
01:09:01,268 --> 01:09:02,702

[exhales]

1065
01:09:24,891 --> 01:09:27,660
What have you got to do to get
a fucking drink around here, eh?

1066
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:37,037
Will you stop sulking?

1067
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:41,075
It has to be done
whether you like it or not.

1068
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:43,810
Are you gonna be scared of her
your whole life?

1069
01:09:45,645 --> 01:09:46,878
Right, stop the car.

1070
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,415
- Elton...
- I said, stop the car!

1071
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:56,789
You're onstage in 15 minutes.

1072
01:09:57,991 --> 01:10:00,491
You're the big-shot manager.
You make my excuses.

1073
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:04,664
Tell them I'm indisposed,
breaking my mother's heart!

1074
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:06,865
Elton. Elton!

1075
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:08,533
- Drive 'round, Denis.

I'm... a homosexual.

1088
01:10:54,447 --> 01:10:55,981
A poofter.

1089
01:10:57,317 --> 01:10:58,717
A fairy.

A queen.

1091
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,592
Well, say something.

1092
01:11:11,064 --> 01:11:13,633
Oh, for God's sake,
I know that.

- You don't mind?
- Frankly, I don't care.

1095
01:11:22,941 --> 01:11:26,044
But I'd rather you keep
that sort of thing to yourself.

1096
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:30,613
I just hope you realize
you're choosing a life

1097
01:11:30,615 --> 01:11:32,251
of being alone forever.

1098
01:11:33,419 --> 01:11:35,822

Don't ever put me
in this position again.

1104
01:11:57,909 --> 01:11:59,176
You're onstage in 10 minutes,

1105
01:11:59,178 --> 01:12:00,978
so get over yourself
and do the show.

1106

We're running a business here,
you fucking idiot.

1107

- [grunts]
- Don't ever put your hands on me.

1108
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:13,792
Real love's hard to come by.

1109
01:12:20,999 --> 01:12:22,901
So you find a way
to cope without it.

Got the number-one album
in America. Again.

1115
01:13:29,334 --> 01:13:33,735
I'm about to embark on the
highest-grossing tour in rock history.

1116
01:13:33,737 --> 01:13:35,671
I'm personally responsible
for five percent

of all record sales
on the entire planet,

1118

and I have the biggest
headdress known to man.

1119
01:13:40,912 --> 01:13:42,879
So, yeah,
I think I'm okay, Bernie.

1120

It used to just be
the two of us.

1121

Now there's busloads of people
just to do the music.

Hang on, hang on,
don't you wanna just

1123

this ridiculous paraphernalia?

You know,
just be yourself, Reg?

Why the fuck
would I want that, Bernie?

1126
01:13:58,997 --> 01:14:01,998
You wouldn't say this shit to me
if you were a real friend.

1127

maybe we should quit the booze

for a couple of days,
take some quality time together...

1157

[man] Mr. Reid.

1159
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:34,750
- What are you doing, John?
- Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.

1160
01:16:34,752 --> 01:16:37,588
Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your
secretary in front of the pool boys!

1161
01:16:37,887 --> 01:16:40,457
Rock 'n' roll is getting you
out of your bed in the morning.

1162
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:43,592
Arranging 250 gigs
in 26 different countries.

1163
01:16:43,594 --> 01:16:46,463
Rock 'n' roll's actually
112 employment contracts,

1164
01:16:46,697 --> 01:16:48,497
insurance, copyright indemnity,

1165
01:16:48,499 --> 01:16:50,632
renegotiating your
previously insane contracts

1166
01:16:50,634 --> 01:16:52,200
and wiping your arse.

1167
01:16:52,202 --> 01:16:54,269
You know, all you do, Elton,
is play the piano.

1168
01:16:54,271 --> 01:16:57,405
But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87
million-dollar-a-year industry.

1169
01:16:57,407 --> 01:17:00,109
Maybe I just play the piano,
but you know what else I do?

1170
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,845
Hmm? I pay, John.

1171
01:17:03,646 --> 01:17:04,881
For everything.

1172
01:17:05,214 --> 01:17:07,417
Including this house,
which I'd like you to leave now.

1173
01:17:07,817 --> 01:17:11,118
You may still be my manager,
but you and me are finished.

1174
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,120
- You're so predictable.
- No, not predictable.

1175
01:17:13,122 --> 01:17:14,690
I want to be by myself,

1176
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:18,193
not with some asshole
who doesn't give a shit about me

1177

- Get out!
- [Sheila] Yoo-hoo!

1179
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:25,501
Elton.

1180
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:28,102
What are they doing here?

1181
01:17:28,104 --> 01:17:29,403
[John]
You told me to hire a jet

1182
01:17:29,405 --> 01:17:30,741
and fly them over
for the gig.

1183
01:17:31,407 --> 01:17:34,542
- No, no, next week, John.
- It is next week.

1184
01:17:34,544 --> 01:17:36,277
I'm gonna go
and fetch them a drink.

1185
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:37,978
Darling, why don't you
clean yourself up,

1186
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,347
because you fucking stink.

1187
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:42,919
Sheila! It's been too long.

1188
01:17:43,386 --> 01:17:45,985
- Beautiful woman.
- Hello, look at this, you lovely lot.

1189
01:17:45,987 --> 01:17:47,323
- Here we are.
- Hi, Nan.

1190
01:17:48,056 --> 01:17:51,192
- I can't believe I'm actually in America.
- I know.

1191
01:17:51,194 --> 01:17:52,914
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

1192
01:17:53,129 --> 01:17:54,695
- Elton.
- Hello, Mum.

1193
01:17:54,697 --> 01:17:57,298
Elton, darling,
you remember the Andersons

1194

- No, your problem is you're selfish.
- [Elton] No.

1570
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:15,345
My problem was I believed
you loved me.
