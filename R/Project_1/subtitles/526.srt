Time to open the orders, sir.

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,767
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

l must oversee
the stability of the crew, Captain.

00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,304
By invading my privacy?

14
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:55,351
Privacy is not a major concern
in the Soviet Union, comrade.

15
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,022

01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,722
A little.

23
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:38,852
It's wise to study
the ways of one's adversary.

24
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:40,729
Don't you think?

25
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,119
The Captain is fighting them.
