You still drinking that fancy coffee?

1215
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,573
What?

1216
01:23:58,116 --> 01:23:59,324
What are you, obsessed?

1217

[CARTER CHUCKLES]

1218
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:06,373
Read it.

1219
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:12,880
"Kopi Luwak is the world's
most expensive coffee.

1220
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:18,260
Though for some, it falls under
the category of 'too good to be true.'

1221
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,472
In the Sumatran village
where the beans are grown...

1222
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:24,391
...lives a breed of wild tree cat.

1223
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:29,438
These cats eat the beans,
digest them and then...

1224
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,440
...defecate.

1225
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:37,738
The villagers then collect
and process the stools.

1226
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:42,326
It is the combination of the beans
and the gastric juices of the tree cat...

1227
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:46,914
...that give Kopi Luwak
its unique flavor...

1228
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,999
...and aroma."

1229
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,627
You're shitting me.

1230
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:56,131
Cats beat me to it.

1231
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,862
-You got a pen? Give me a pen.
-What?

1232
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,073
What?

1233
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:44,721
Here.

1234
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,354
It's not finished.

1235
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,356
Well....

1236
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,942
It's not a one-man deal.

1237
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,571
I'm afraid it'll have to be.

1238
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,387
We're ready.

1239
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:35,647
I'll be here when you get back.

1240
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,192
Sounds good to me.

1241
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:25,030
<i>CARTER: Dear Edward, I've gone</i>
<i>back and forth the last few days...</i>

1242
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,533
<i>...trying to decide whether or not</i>
<i>I should even write this.</i>

1243
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:34,539
<i>In the end, I realized</i>
<i>I would regret it if I didn't...</i>

1244
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:36,875
<i>...so here goes.</i>

1245
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:39,878
<i>I know the last time</i>
<i>we saw each other...</i>

1246
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:43,131
<i>...we weren't exactly hitting</i>
<i>the sweetest notes.</i>

1247
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:46,510
<i>It certainly wasn't the way</i>
<i>I wanted the trip to end.</i>

1248
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:53,684
<i>I suppose I'm responsible,</i>
<i>and for that I'm sorry.</i>

1249
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,897
<i>But, in all honesty,</i>
<i>if I had the chance, I'd do it again.</i>

1250
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:07,030
<i>Virginia said I left a stranger</i>
<i>and came back a husband.</i>

1251
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:10,117
<i>I owe that to you.</i>

1252
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:15,622
<i>There's no way I can repay you</i>
<i>for all you've done for me...</i>

1253
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:21,586
<i>...so rather than try, I'm just going to</i>
<i>ask you to do something else for me.</i>

1254
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,881
<i>Find the joy in your life.</i>

1255
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:29,678
<i>You once said you're not everyone.</i>

1256
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:32,306
<i>Well, that's true.</i>

1257
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,933
<i>You're certainly not everyone.</i>

1258
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:39,271
<i>But everyone is everyone.</i>

1259
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,984
<i>My pastor always says:</i>

1260
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:47,070
<i>"Our lives are streams...</i>

1261
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,448
<i>...flowing into the same river...</i>

1262
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:54,036
<i>...towards whatever heaven lies</i>
<i>in the mist beyond the falls."</i>

1263
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:57,622
Hello, sweetie. Hi.

1264
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,584
CARTER:
<i>Find the joy in your life, Edward.</i>

1265
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,759
<i>My dear friend...</i>

1266
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:14,723
<i>...close your eyes</i>
<i>and let the waters take you home.</i>

1267
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:21,980
Good afternoon.
My name is Edward Cole.

1268
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:29,988
I don't know what most people say
at these occasions, because...

1269
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,949
...in all honesty, I....

1270
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:37,204
I've tried to avoid them.

1271
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,668
The simplest thing is...

1272
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:47,964
...I loved him and I miss him.

1273
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,348
Carter and I saw the world together.

1274
01:29:58,101 --> 01:30:00,227
Which is amazing...

1275
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,105
...when you think that only
three months ago...

1276
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:06,108
...we were complete strangers.

1277
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,073
I hope...

1278
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:17,994
...that it doesn't sound
selfish of me...

1279
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:22,416
...but the last months of his life...

1280
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,877
...were the best months of mine.

1281
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,090
He saved my life.

1282
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,219
And he knew it before I did.

1283
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:41,435
EDWARD:
<i>I'm deeply proud that this man...</i>

1284
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:46,022
<i>...found it worth his while</i>
<i>to know me.</i>

1285
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:49,693
<i>In the end...</i>

1286
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:55,574
<i>...I think it's safe to say that we brought</i>
<i>some joy to one another's lives.</i>

1287
01:30:55,908 --> 01:30:58,952
<i>So, one day, when...</i>

1288
01:30:59,662 --> 01:31:03,081
<i>...I go to some final resting place...</i>

1289
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:08,462
<i>...if I happen to wake up</i>
<i>next to a certain wall with a gate...</i>

1290
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:11,840
<i>...I hope that Carter's there...</i>

1291
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,217
<i>...to vouch for me...</i>

1292
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,429
<i>...and show me the ropes</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

1293
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:26,897
CARTER:
<i>Edward Perriman Cole died in May.</i>

1294
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:30,859
<i>It was a Sunday, in the afternoon...</i>

1295
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,404
<i>...and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

1296
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,656
<i>He was 81 years old.</i>

1297
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:43,205
<i>Even now, I can't claim to understand</i>
<i>the measure of a life.</i>

1298
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,583
<i>But I can tell you this:</i>

1299
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:51,505
<i>I know that when he died,</i>
<i>his eyes were closed...</i>

1300
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:54,841
<i>...and his heart was open.</i>

1301
01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:00,639
<i>And I'm pretty sure he was happy</i>
<i>with his final resting place...</i>

1302
01:32:01,432 --> 01:32:04,726
<i>...because he was buried</i>
<i>on the mountain...</i>

1303
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:08,522
<i>...and that was against the law.</i>

1304
01:37:00,397 --> 01:37:02,398
[THE END]
