1
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:51,214
Do it!

2
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:55,760
You got him! You got him!

3
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,194
<i>I only ever met one man
I wouldn't wanna fight.</i>

4
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,946
I can't stop that.

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,906
Get out of here, you useless tit.

6
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:20,076
<i>When I met him, he was already the best
cut man in the business.</i>

7
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:21,411
Can you stop it?

8
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:24,914
<i>Started training and managing
in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.</i>

9
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,708
No.

10
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:36,134
Let me have a look at him.

11
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,969
He's fine. He's fine.

12
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:40,471
He ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

13
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,223
I'll give you one more round.

14
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:47,270
-Seconds out. Let's go.
-What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,480
You let him hit you.

16
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:55,778
<i>Sometimes there's just
nothing you can do.</i>

17
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:59,115
<i>Cut's too wide, too close to the bone.</i>

18
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,868
<i>Maybe you got a severed vein...</i>

19
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:04,746
<i>...or you just can't get the coagulant
deep enough.</i>

20
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:07,332
-Come on!
-Break. Break.

21
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:10,210
<i>There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against...</i>

22
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,587
<i>...down in the different layers of meat...</i>

23
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,672
<i>...and Frankie knew
how to work every one.</i>

24
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,518
-That's it! Come on!
-What are you doing?

25
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:32,857
Knock him out, Willie!

26
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,326
<i>People love violence.</i>

27
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,913
<i>They'll slow down at a car wreck
to check for bodies.</i>

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,332
<i>Same people claim to love boxing.</i>

29
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,876
<i>They got no idea what it is.</i>

30
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,504
<i>Boxing is about respect.</i>

31
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,506
<i>Getting it for yourself...</i>

32
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:00,051
<i>...and taking it away from the other guy.</i>

33
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,431
I'll warm up the car.

34
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:06,975
Mr. Dunn?

35
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,143
I owe you money?

36
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:10,603
No, sir.

37
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,272
I know your mama?

38
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,566
Don't rightly know, sir.

39
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:17,193
-Then what is it you want?
-I was on the undercard.

40
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:19,946
I won my fight too. Maggie Fitzgerald.

41
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,740
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

42
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,201
-Did you happen to see it?
-Nope.

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,870
I did pretty good.

44
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,497
Thought you might be interested
in training me.

45
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,374
I don't train girls.

46
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,044
Maybe you should. People see me fight
say I'm pretty tough.

47
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:39,132
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

48
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,147
It's a mistake.

49
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,446
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

50
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,073
Just push, will you?

51
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,911
-What did Hogan want?
-Offered us a title shot.

52
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:09,913
About time.

53
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,081
I turned him down flat.

54
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,710
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

55
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:23,134
Been two or three more fights
for a long time now, Frankie.

56
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,762
Look, Willie,
you get one shot at the title.

57
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,931
You lose it,
it may not come around again.

58
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:31,935
Now, two or three more fights
and we'll be ready.

59
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:34,729
Whatever you say, Frankie.

60
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,734
<i>Frankie liked to say that boxing
is an unnatural act...</i>

61
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:42,987
<i>...that everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

62
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:46,282
<i>Sometimes...</i>

63
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:50,119
<i>...best way to deliver a punch
is step back.</i>

64
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,631
Well, do your best, Lord...

65
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,967
...protect Katy.

66
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,678
Annie too.

67
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,097
Other than that...

68
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:13,226
...you know what I want,
there's no use me repeating myself.

69
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:18,273
<i>But step back too far,
you ain't fighting at all.</i>

70
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,875
-Bye.
-Bye.

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,670
Father, that was a great sermon.
Made me weep.

72
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,338
What's confusing you this week?

73
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,924
Oh, it's the same old
one-God-three-God thing.

74
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:48,386
Frankie, most people figure out
by kindergarten it's about faith.

75
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:53,016
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop
all rolled up in one big box?

76
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:57,353
You're standing outside my church
comparing God to Rice Krispies?

77
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:00,315
The only reason you come to Mass
is to wind me up.

78
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:02,525
-It won't happen this morning.
-I'm confused.

79
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,027
-No, you aren't.
-Yes, I am.

80
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:07,363
Then here's your answer:
There's one God.

81
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:09,073
Anything else? Because I'm busy.

82
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,076
-What about the Holy Ghost?
-He's an expression of God's love.

83
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:14,787
-And Jesus?
-Son of God. Don't play stupid.

84
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,332
What is he then?
Does that make him a demigod?

85
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,876
There are no demigods,
you fucking pagan!

86
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,259
-Did you write your daughter?
-Absolutely.

87
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:29,928
Now you're lying to a priest.

88
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,681
You know what? Take a day off,
don't come to Mass tomorrow.

89
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:48,238
<i>Some people would say the most important
thing a fighter can have is heart.</i>

90
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:52,242
<i>Frankie would say, "Show me a fighter
who's nothing but heart...</i>

91
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:55,578
<i>...and I'll show you a man
waiting for a beating. "</i>

92
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:07,340
<i>Think I only ever met one fighter
who was all heart.</i>

93
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:12,262
My name's Dangerous Dillard
Fighting Flippo Bam-Bam Barch...

94
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:14,305
...out of Broward County, Texas!

95
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:19,811
<i>Danger showed up
a couple of years back.</i>

96
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,692
<i>He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,
his mama's new boyfriend.</i>

97
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:31,155
<i>Apparently Ervel got lost
and ended up back in Texas.</i>

98
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:35,910
<i>Danger looked for him for about a week
before he introduced himself.</i>

99
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:42,834
Hey, you know, I gots nothing
against niggers.

100
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,254
Well, that's nice to hear.

101
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:51,050
Yeah, lots of people where
I comes from does...

102
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:54,804
...but my mama taught me
not to cause hurt to no man...

103
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,639
...niggers or not.

104
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:59,434
You got a nice mama.
Anything else I can do for you?

105
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,895
<i>Just one of those questions you ask...</i>

106
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:04,272
<i>...but Danger wanted to give it
his best answer.</i>

107
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,484
Well, sir, I'd likes to become
the welterweight champion of the world.

108
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:13,615
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra...

109
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:15,533
...Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

110
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:19,746
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world!

111
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:22,582
Yo, Flip, shut up, man!
You ain't even ranked.

112
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,585
You gotta have at least one fight
to be ranked.

113
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,046
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

114
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,173
Hey, you a bad man, huh?

115
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,342
Get in the ring. Go a round with me.

116
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,345
-Shawrelle.
-I will.

117
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,805
Leave him alone.

118
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:41,226
Danger, you go on back to training.

119
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:44,145
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

120
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:49,692
Them's some nice tights, Danger.

121
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,904
I'll give you that ass-whupping later,
Olive Oyl.

122
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:55,406
Hey, bro, those pants look
real pretty on you.

123
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,242
Give his mama back her tights.

124
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,246
<i>Shawrelle Berry had a left hook
that would move a tank...</i>

125
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:04,457
<i>...but he had a heart
the size of a split pea.</i>

126
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,795
<i>Frankie bought the Hit Pit
from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.</i>

127
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,257
<i>Bobby wanted to move to Florida,
and Frankie wanted some security.</i>

128
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,009
<i>Bobby died while he was packing.</i>

129
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:19,597
<i>And Frankie found out
most gyms lose money.</i>

130
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,892
I thought I told you I didn't want
Danger working out here anymore.

131
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,602
He ain't hurting nothing, Frankie.

132
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,646
Well, he's hurting me.

133
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:31,025
Breaking my heart, watching him punch
the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.

134
00:09:31,734 --> 00:09:34,654
And how many times have I gotta tell you
that bleach is bleach?

135
00:09:34,863 --> 00:09:38,408
Why can't you buy the cheap stuff?
You don't have to buy the expensive stuff.

136
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,410
It smells better, Frankie.

137
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,162
Bleach smells like bleach.

138
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:55,383
-Hey, Scrap.
-Hey, Mr. Willie.

139
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,679
Hey, nice fight last night.

140
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,810
Nice fight.

141
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:10,815
-Big Willie.
-Hey, Sally.

142
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:15,528
-Nice fight.
-Thanks, man.

143
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,363
People are talking.

144
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,090
What the hell kind of language is that?

145
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:38,009
What do you want?

146
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:41,513
I thought you might like to know
you got a fighter out there...

147
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:43,348
...not talking to another manager.

148
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:46,893
Not talking to another manager?

149
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,686
And not just any manager.

150
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:51,523
Mickey Mack.

151
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,654
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie
is not talking to Mickey Mack.

152
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:00,198
Not a word. Neither one of them.

153
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:03,451
I'm trying to read here.

154
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,912
Well, if you think that's more important.

155
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,749
Who's your new girl?

156
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,627
What?

157
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,223
Jesus Christ.

158
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,683
Better hurry up.

159
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:29,686
She keeps hitting it like that,
she gonna break her wrists.

160
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:40,905
You're wasting your time.
I told you I don't train girls.

161
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:42,740
Thought you might change your mind.

162
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:46,911
Dozens of trainers train girls.
You won't have any trouble finding one.

163
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:49,622
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.
You'll do fine.

164
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:53,376
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,
and don't you be calling me that.

165
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:56,254
-Willie, you ready to work?
-Anytime.

166
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,340
If I stop calling you boss,
will you train me?

167
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,676
No.

168
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,761
Then I might as well keep calling you it.

169
00:12:05,263 --> 00:12:08,099
<i>She came from southwestern Missouri...</i>

170
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:12,312
<i>...the hills outside the scratch-ass
Ozark town of Theodosia...</i>

171
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:17,483
<i>...set in the cedars and oak trees
somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.</i>

172
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:21,779
<i>She grew up knowing one thing:
She was trash.</i>

173
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:37,086
It's for my dog.

174
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:42,842
<i>She'd come 1800 miles,
but Theodosia was still just over the hill.</i>

175
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,570
Working the bag, boss.

176
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:06,908
I'm not your boss.
And that bag's working you.

177
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,882
Give her her money back.

178
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,552
You sure?

179
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,680
-How much did she pay?
-Six months.

180
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,183
-Jesus Christ.
-No, I'll give it back.

181
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,853
No, don't be a smartass now, will you?

182
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:37,605
Woman thinks I'll throw away
six months' worth of dues...

183
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:40,024
...just to get rid of her,
she's out of her mind.

184
00:13:40,191 --> 00:13:42,861
-But just don't encourage her, understand?
-Okay.

185
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,781
And what's Danger doing out there?
What's he looking at?

186
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,496
Looks like a bottle of water.

187
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,957
He paid his dues?

188
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:00,670
Dues? Boy can't afford pants.
Want him to pay dues?

189
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,756
Get out of my office.

190
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:14,767
Fuck me.

191
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,440
Can't think of it as a bag.

192
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:10,114
I'm not a trainer,
but I can show you this if you'd like.

193
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,408
Appreciate any help I can get.

194
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:17,914
What you wanna do is,
you wanna think of it as a man, see?

195
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,332
And he's constantly moving.

196
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:24,003
He's moving towards you, around you,
away from you. All right?

197
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,675
Don't hit him when he's coming towards you
because he's just gonna push you back...

198
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:32,220
...he's gonna smother your punches
and take your balance, right?

199
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:33,888
So you watch him real carefully.

200
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,391
Keep rotating.
That keeps your head moving.

201
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:40,311
And keep one shoulder back so you're
always ready to fire a power shot.

202
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:45,233
Right? Go ahead, now. Good, good.
Keep rotating, keep moving. That's it.

203
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,611
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

204
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:52,699
Come on around.
Keep moving, keep moving.

205
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:54,492
-Good, good, good.
-Like that?

206
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:57,078
Yeah. Give it a few shots.

207
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:01,708
Tuck that chin in, now.
Tuck that chin in.

208
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:04,711
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

209
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:08,631
Now, you get this down,
we'll put you on the speed bag.

210
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:13,595
You do have a speed bag.

211
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:27,275
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

212
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,985
All right, you go on home now.

213
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:32,030
-I'll walk out with you?
-No, I am home.

214
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:34,449
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

215
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,709
It's nice.

216
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,756
Would it bother you
if I worked a little longer?

217
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:54,260
No, just pull the door closed
when you leave.

218
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:58,264
Thank you.

219
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:16,199
<i>If there's magic in boxing...</i>

220
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:19,953
<i>...it's the magic of fighting battles
beyond endurance...</i>

221
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:25,458
<i>...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys
and detached retinas.</i>

222
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:41,391
<i>It's the magic of risking everything
for a dream that nobody sees but you.</i>

223
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:53,111
Okay, okay, fellas, watch the footwork.

224
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,154
Hey, that's it. That's it.

225
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,198
Hands up.

226
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,243
Jab, jab, jab.

227
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,633
Hey, Flip.

228
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,927
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

229
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,722
I think I found somebody you can beat.

230
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,935
I don't fights women.

231
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:29,480
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro,
because you know why?

232
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:32,275
Because she--
Like, you, you could fight to him...

233
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,110
...and then you could kiss to him.

234
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:35,945
Then you fight to him one more time.

235
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,865
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

236
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:41,451
-It's like poetry.
-You been reading and shit.

237
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,162
-Thanks, bro.
-That's a girl, man?

238
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:48,791
Flip, I think you right. Look at her little
bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,628
Man, that's barely even a mouthful.
Let me see.

240
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:53,421
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

241
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,508
Spent so much time face down,
I thought the canvas had titties.

242
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:06,309
Canvas has titties.
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

243
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:17,320
Just humping the canvas.
Humping the floor.

244
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:22,784
Come on, bro. The floor having titties?
That's funny, bro.

245
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,954
Shut up, man.
What you laughing at?

246
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,832
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

247
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,376
Some titties right there, man.

248
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:36,422
Yo, when they start making those tights
for men, Flippy?

249
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:38,174
Punk.

250
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,262
All right, that's enough.
That's enough for the day.

251
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:47,725
-I'll give you a rubdown.
-Oh, I can't, Frankie.

252
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:50,937
Middle one's got a piano lesson.
I told Grace I'd drive her.

253
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:54,274
-Something wrong with Gracie's car?
-She hates that car.

254
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,694
Wants the old one back,
but the dealer said he's already got a buyer.

255
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,571
Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

256
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,448
I'd appreciate that.

257
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:03,908
Okay.

258
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,870
-Thanks.
-See you later.

259
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:18,089
The man's a rubdown whore.
Today he doesn't want one.

260
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:21,050
You ever do any work around here?

261
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:24,512
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

262
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,893
Little girl seems to be coming along.

263
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:35,023
Yeah. It's almost like
someone's been helping her.

264
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:39,944
She might just be a natural.
Looks like she's got something.

265
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:45,283
She's got my speed bag,
that's what she's got.

266
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,161
I wonder how the hell she got that.

267
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:49,871
I wonder.

268
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,883
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

269
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,594
-This bag?
-Yes, that bag. That's my bag.

270
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:07,639
And if you're hitting it,
people will think I'm training you.

271
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,307
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

272
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:11,476
Yes. Yes, it is.

273
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:14,854
Every time you touch it,
you're losing me business out here.

274
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:18,274
-I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
-Yeah.

275
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,153
Well, I can't just lend it
to anybody, you know.

276
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:23,613
I understand.

277
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,907
Yeah.

278
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,662
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

279
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,790
-Can I give you some advice?
-I'd appreciate that.

280
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,918
You'll find a trainer in this gym
or somewhere else...

281
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,128
...that's gonna wanna train a girl.

282
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,548
It's the latest freak show out there.

283
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:44,092
The trouble is, they're gonna be
wasting your time...

284
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,927
...because you're too old.

285
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,638
I don't feel that old.

286
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:52,308
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me
fighting 21 -year-olds, do you?

287
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,979
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

288
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:58,231
How old are you?

289
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:02,277
-Thirty-one until my next birthday.
-Oh, well, there you go.

290
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,028
Thirty-one.

291
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:07,866
You wouldn't start training to be
a ballerina at 31, would you?

292
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:09,993
Already been working it
for three years.

293
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:13,788
And you can't hit a speed bag?
What kind of training is that?

294
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:15,832
Never had any, boss.

295
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,294
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

296
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:21,504
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

297
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:24,674
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

298
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,509
Yeah.

299
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:30,763
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

300
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:36,728
-You're not gonna cry now, are you?
-No, sir.

301
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,813
Yeah.

302
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,525
Here.

303
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:46,029
-Keep the goddamn thing.
-No, you need it.

304
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,031
No, take the bag.

305
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:51,367
I haven't seen it in 20 years anyway.

306
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:55,955
I've had three since then.
Just enjoy it, will you?

307
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,708
-I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
-Yeah.

308
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,336
Just don't lose it.

309
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:11,471
Yeah, I know, Hogan...

310
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:14,474
...your guy's the champ,
so we don't split 50s...

311
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,310
...but if I don't see 40 percent--

312
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:22,023
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40
or don't call me back at all.

313
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,868
-Hey, Willie.
-Hey, Frankie.

314
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:35,620
Something wrong?

315
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:39,666
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
I know you don't like people dropping in.

316
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,169
Oh, you're not people, Willie.
You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

317
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:46,214
I wanted to thank you
for getting Gracie's car back.

318
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:48,216
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

319
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:52,595
Paying an extra thousand dollars
for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

320
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,597
Gracie cried when she saw it.

321
00:23:54,806 --> 00:23:56,432
Really?

322
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,561
I also needed to talk with you
about business.

323
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:03,731
Oh, yeah, well, I just got off the phone
with Hogan. We're all set for September.

324
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,775
Everything but the split.

325
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:07,777
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

326
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,322
What?

327
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:17,996
Willie, the title's just two fights away.

328
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:22,417
It ain't that, it's--
It's like you said, I got one shot.

329
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,545
If I win, I gotta make
as much as I can while I can.

330
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:29,465
I need somebody in the action
who can make things happen.

331
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,261
And I gotta make the change
before the fight.

332
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:36,890
Only way this guy say he'd take me
is if he took me to the title.

333
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:40,935
So I get you the title fight,
and this guy takes you there?

334
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:42,312
Only way he'd do it.

335
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:47,025
I'm sorry, Frankie. I know how long
you waiting on a title.

336
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:48,693
I wish it could've been with me.

337
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:54,491
Mickey Mack's a businessman.
He can't teach you nothing.

338
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,535
You already taught me
everything I need to know.

339
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:09,047
<i>There's some things people
just don't want to hear.</i>

340
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:24,687
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,
Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...

341
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:29,192
...to fight me for the welterweight
championship of the whole world.

342
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:32,070
Danger, I'm wearing
these mitts for a reason.

343
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:36,241
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

344
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:40,912
Danger, you throw a punch
or get the hell out of this gym.

345
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,753
Danger, while you thinking about
that punch, I'll be right back.

346
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:54,175
I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard
for you, Mr. Scrap.

347
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:05,395
<i>No one had the heart to tell Danger
that Hearns retired years ago.</i>

348
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,779
I heard about Willie.

349
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:18,158
That's cold. That's dead cold.

350
00:26:18,283 --> 00:26:21,286
Of course, it wouldn't be so bad
if you weren't so damn old.

351
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:24,372
Yeah, well, at least I can see
through both eyes.

352
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:27,083
Didn't do you
a lot of good though, did it?

353
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:30,295
Well, I've got the gym.

354
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:33,840
Don't need to be training fighters
at my age.

355
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:36,509
Willie tell you why?

356
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:39,596
It was Mickey.
Mickey's got the connections.

357
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:43,099
Oh, it ain't about connections.
It's about you not believing in him.

358
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:45,935
Well, I found him,
I stuck with him for eight years.

359
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,104
How's that for not believing in him?

360
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,691
You could've got him a title fight
two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

361
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:53,943
I'm amazed he stayed around this long.

362
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,363
Well, getting there and taking home
the belt are two different things.

363
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,450
What was I supposed to do,
just put him in over his head?

364
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:01,993
Not protect him?

365
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:04,496
Oh, you were protecting him
from the championship.

366
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:08,166
-Yeah.
-Well, now it makes sense.

367
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:11,961
Well, what about you, Scrap?
What did your manager do?

368
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:14,297
You were a hell of a fighter,
better than Willie.

369
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,800
He get you a title fight,
or did he just bust you out...

370
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,429
...banging your head against other
people's fists until you lost your eye?

371
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,723
I had my shot.

372
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,518
I went out swinging,
and no man can say I didn't.

373
00:27:26,684 --> 00:27:27,894
Yeah, well, I remember.

374
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:31,814
And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter
spending the second half of his life...

375
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:35,193
-...cleaning up other people's spit.
-Yeah, right.

376
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:39,531
Right, you're the smart one.
You're the one learning Greek.

377
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:41,741
It's Gaelic.

378
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:44,994
Well, you just protected yourself
out of a championship fight.

379
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:47,997
How do you say that in Gaelic?

380
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:57,525
Sorry.

381
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,159
Thanks.

382
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:10,580
<i>The action continues as the champ
is battling Big Willie Jones...</i>

383
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,707
<i>...and commanding him
with rights and lefts.</i>

384
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:15,585
<i>Up against the ropes,
he's hitting him with the left....</i>

385
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:19,214
<i>Boxing is an unnatural act.</i>

386
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,759
<i>Because everything in it is backwards.</i>

387
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:26,638
<i>You wanna move to the left...</i>

388
00:29:26,846 --> 00:29:30,141
<i>...you don't step left,
you push on the right toe.</i>

389
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,854
<i>To move right, you use your left toe.</i>

390
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:38,983
<i>Instead of running from the pain,
like a sane person would do...</i>

391
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,568
<i>...you step into it.</i>

392
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:46,115
<i>But Big Willie comes back. Oh, my God,
he hits the champ with a right hand.</i>

393
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:48,660
<i>And the champ is down.</i>

394
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:51,162
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
the ref is in for the count.</i>

395
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:54,666
<i>And Big Willie Jones
is the new champion of the world.</i>

396
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:58,503
<i>It's unbelievable how
this has taken place tonight...</i>

397
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,965
<i>...but there you have it, folks,
a new champion.</i>

398
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,678
<i>Everything in boxing is backwards.</i>

399
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:23,653
Want a cheeseburger?

400
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,572
-You bought me a cheeseburger?
-Yeah.

401
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,824
I never see you buy anybody
a cheeseburger.

402
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:31,035
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.
You want it?

403
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:34,247
Well, I guess the planet
can go back to spinning.

404
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,377
-You watch the fight?
-Yeah, I watched it.

405
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:41,838
Willie did good.

406
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,549
That's what you've got to say?

407
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:47,385
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

408
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:52,724
I see you been working on yourself,
learning to open up. That's good work.

409
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:54,642
You watch it?

410
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:57,020
Yeah, I got HBO.

411
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:00,315
Now, how can you afford HBO?

412
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:04,319
How long have I been telling you
to save your money?

413
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:06,988
Ever since I fought
Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...

414
00:31:07,197 --> 00:31:09,365
...at the Stadium Club
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

415
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,243
-That true?
-Yeah.

416
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,080
Manager ran off
and left you and me to hitch home.

417
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:17,540
Don't you remember nothing?

418
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:22,170
Well, I remember walking halfway
and thinking I was gonna be lynched.

419
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:26,257
I remember you leaving me with my dick
in my hand behind that gas station.

420
00:31:26,424 --> 00:31:29,886
Yeah, well, I got a ride. The guy took off
before I hardly closed the door.

421
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:32,555
I had to walk back two miles.

422
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:35,892
Your conscience got the better of you,
that's what.

423
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:41,272
What the hell's that?

424
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,775
It's her birthday.

425
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,133
You're not breathing right.
That's why you're panting.

426
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:12,178
So it's your birthday, huh?

427
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,556
How old does that make you?

428
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:17,600
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn.

429
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:21,354
I'm celebrating that I spent another year
scraping dishes and waitressing...

430
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:23,481
...which is what I been doing since 13.

431
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,695
And according to you, I'll be 37
before I can even throw a decent punch...

432
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,614
...which after working this speed bag
for a month and getting nowhere...

433
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,950
...I now realize may be God's simple truth.

434
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,327
Other truth is, my brother's in prison...

435
00:32:36,494 --> 00:32:40,039
...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending
one of her kids is still alive...

436
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:42,792
...my daddy's dead,
and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

437
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:46,254
If I was thinking straight,
I'd go back home...

438
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:50,884
...find a used trailer,
buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

439
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,804
The problem is, this is the only thing
I ever felt good doing.

440
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:58,016
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

441
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,643
That enough truth to suit you?

442
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:04,147
This your speed bag?

443
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:07,275
Put yours behind the counter.
Wish I could say I wore it out.

444
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:12,780
Okay, just hold it. Hold it.

445
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:16,117
I'll show you a few things,
and then we'll get you a trainer.

446
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:17,869
No, sorry.

447
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:20,538
-You're in a position to negotiate?
-Yes, sir.

448
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:24,667
Because I know if you train me right,
I'm gonna be a champ.

449
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,962
I seen you looking at me.

450
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:31,049
-Yeah, out of pity.
-Don't you say that.

451
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:34,093
Don't you say that if it ain't true.

452
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:36,012
I want a trainer.

453
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:40,058
I don't want charity,
and I don't want favors.

454
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:47,524
If you're not interested,
then I got more celebrating to do.

455
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:52,070
Stop, stop, stop.

456
00:33:52,195 --> 00:33:56,241
Goddamn it, stop.
What the hell are you doing?

457
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:01,579
Okay.

458
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:03,373
If I'm gonna take you on--

459
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:07,001
-You won't never regret it.
-Look, just listen to me.

460
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,004
-lf I take you on--
-I promise I'll work so hard.

461
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,549
God, this is a mistake already.

462
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,177
I'm listening, boss.

463
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:21,599
If I take you on, you don't say anything,
you don't question me.

464
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:25,812
You don't ask why, you don't say
anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."

465
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:29,065
And I'm gonna try to forget the fact
that you're a girl.

466
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,441
That's all I ask.

467
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,111
And don't come crying to me
if you get hurt.

468
00:34:33,903 --> 00:34:35,905
-Alrighty.
-We got a deal.

469
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,241
No, not quite.

470
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:40,368
I'm gonna teach you how to fight...

471
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,246
...then we'll get you a manager,
and I'm off down the road.

472
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:47,041
-I hate to argue with you, but--
-Don't argue, that's the way we're doing it.

473
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,920
I teach you all you need to know,
and you go off and make a million dollars.

474
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:54,090
I don't care. You get your teeth
knocked out, I don't care.

475
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:57,468
I don't wanna hear about it.
That's just the way it's gonna be.

476
00:34:57,594 --> 00:34:59,179
It's the only way I'll do it.

477
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:08,605
All right.

478
00:35:09,689 --> 00:35:14,694
Now, one of the things I've noticed around
the gym is you never move your feet.

479
00:35:14,819 --> 00:35:18,114
You stand there just flat-footed.
You've gotta move your feet.

480
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:20,450
That's one of the best things
I can teach you.

481
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,453
So here's what you do.

482
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:26,122
You get yourself--
Bend your knees a little bit.

483
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:30,168
Get in an athletic position.
Look like you're gonna hit something.

484
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:35,423
-Move them how, boss?
-Just-- Go-- Hit the bag.

485
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,135
-Stop.
-What'd I do wrong?

486
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:41,429
Okay, you did two things wrong.

487
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:44,933
One is you asked a question,
and two is you asked another question.

488
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:49,312
Now, what I want you to do,
it's not about hitting it hard...

489
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:53,399
...it's how good you hit it. So watch me.

490
00:35:53,566 --> 00:35:55,151
You can count with me if you want.

491
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:58,154
It's just count. On a one-count,
I hit right through the bag.

492
00:35:58,404 --> 00:36:00,365
-Can you show me that again?
-I just--

493
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:02,575
Just say "one," please.

494
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:04,202
-One.
-Okay.

495
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:06,204
-One. Okay.
-One.

496
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:09,499
Yeah, just say "one." That's good.
That's good.

497
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:14,337
Then I move over to my right foot. You'll
see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

498
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:19,759
Then I hit it with my back of my hand, sort
of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

499
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:25,265
Then I come over, and I shift to my left foot,
and I hit it with my right hand.

500
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:28,059
And ice pick maneuver again.

501
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:31,271
And I come over on my right foot
and hit it right.

502
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,525
Don't watch anything but my feet.

503
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:50,540
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

504
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:24,407
<i>You show them how to stand,
keep their legs under their shoulders.</i>

505
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:36,544
<i>To make a fighter,
you gotta strip them down to bare wood.</i>

506
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:38,171
Rest when you're dead.

507
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:40,006
Come here.

508
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:47,180
<i>You can't just tell them
to forget everything you know...</i>

509
00:37:47,347 --> 00:37:50,391
<i>...you gotta make them forget it
in their bones.</i>

510
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,814
<i>Make them so tired
they only listen to you.</i>

511
00:37:56,981 --> 00:38:01,027
<i>Only hear your voice,
only do what you say, and nothing else.</i>

512
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:02,403
Move your feet.

513
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,572
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

514
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:22,799
<i>Show them how to keep their balance
and take it away from the other guy.</i>

515
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:26,719
Not so low. Look at me.
Right hook and just turn right.

516
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,810
<i>How to generate momentum
off your right toe.</i>

517
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:38,314
<i>And how to flex your knees
when you fire a jab.</i>

518
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:48,908
<i>How to fight backing up, so that the
other guy doesn't wanna come after you.</i>

519
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,661
<i>Then you gotta show them
all over again.</i>

520
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,080
<i>Over and over and over...</i>

521
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:57,208
<i>...till they think they were born that way.</i>

522
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:00,253
Shift.

523
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:02,338
Shift away.

524
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:06,509
Okay. That's enough for today.

525
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:10,138
Good work. Good girl.

526
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:14,058
You think I ready for a fight, boss?

527
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:40,084
Hey. Hey, come here.

528
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:44,088
You're not breathing.

529
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:47,425
Hate to disagree with you.

530
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,887
Every time you get under pressure,
you're holding your breath.

531
00:39:51,095 --> 00:39:54,474
-Now, stop doing that.
-Okay.

532
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,935
But other than that,
I'm doing pretty good, right?

533
00:39:57,477 --> 00:40:01,022
-I mean, for a girl.
-I don't train girls.

534
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:05,985
Think I might be ready
for a fight, boss?

535
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:09,697
Well, we'll get a manager,
and we'll find out, won't we?

536
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,867
I'd like to,
but you been keeping me too busy.

537
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:22,585
-Got any family, boss?
-What?

538
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:28,466
You been spending all this time with me,
I didn't know if you had any.

539
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:30,760
No.

540
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,764
Well, I've got a daughter, Katy.

541
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:36,766
That's family.

542
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,644
We're not exactly close.

543
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,563
How much she weigh?

544
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:44,148
What?

545
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:47,485
Trouble in my family
comes by the pound.

546
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,489
Yeah.

547
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,825
Not very big.

548
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:58,079
Used to be real athletic.
Don't know if she kept it up.

549
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:07,714
So, what do you think?

550
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,799
I ready for a fight?

551
00:41:15,513 --> 00:41:17,307
Hey, Sally.

552
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:20,435
Come here for a minute, will you?

553
00:41:22,353 --> 00:41:25,148
Frankie, I need to see you
in the back for a minute, okay?

554
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:29,194
-Can I see you a minute?
-Sally here's a real good manager.

555
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,323
Has a couple of Golden Glove boys.
Looking for a girl, Sally?

556
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,450
I'm looking for a good one.

557
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:38,786
Well, see, there you go.

558
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,374
Nice working with you, girlie.

559
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:49,589
-What'd you want?
-Nothing. It's nothing.

560
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:53,843
I ain't lying, I've been watching you work.
You got a hell of a left.

561
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,678
Thank you.

562
00:41:57,597 --> 00:42:01,226
So you wanna give this a try?
See if it's a fit?

563
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:06,564
-Yeah, sure.
-Good.

564
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:09,234
Because I think you're ready for a fight.

565
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:22,997
Break.

566
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,377
What am I doing wrong, Sally?
Every time I get inside, she's on me.

567
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:30,255
You're doing great.
You're wearing her down. Keep punching.

568
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:33,675
-I ain't doing great, I'm losing.
-You're wearing her down.

569
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,220
You okay, honey? Can you see okay?

570
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,765
-Come on.
-Do it.

571
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,518
Come on, let's do this!

572
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:48,898
That's it!

573
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:57,991
Nice night, eh?

574
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,077
Jesus Christ.

575
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,121
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

576
00:43:03,454 --> 00:43:05,081
Hell of a fighter.

577
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:07,292
11-0.

578
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,460
Your left. Keep your left up.

579
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:16,342
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

580
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:19,596
He's got Joey Adagio,
lightweight champ?

581
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:21,306
Yeah.

582
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,516
Your left, damn it.

583
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:29,063
Wouldn't have been my choice for
her first fight, but Sally's a good manager.

584
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:31,941
-He must think she can take her.
-Jesus H.

585
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,777
Your left. Keep your left up.

586
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,198
You think she can hear you
from back here?

587
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:49,000
Of course, if Maggie loses,
it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

588
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,169
Might even help him.

589
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:53,254
Lonnie's girl gets another win...

590
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:58,009
...Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight
fight Joey Adagio for the title.

591
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:00,595
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

592
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:02,222
Hey, what do I know?

593
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:05,141
I just come because I enjoy the fights.

594
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:07,810
Mother of God.

595
00:44:08,686 --> 00:44:10,230
Okay, break.

596
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:12,732
Hey. Come here, come here.

597
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:14,359
Hey. Get over here.

598
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,362
You're dropping your left hand.
Quit dropping your left hand.

599
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,198
Hey, Frankie,
you mind if I talk to my fighter?

600
00:44:20,406 --> 00:44:23,785
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is this the way you advise your lightweight?

601
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:25,870
Dunn.

602
00:44:26,037 --> 00:44:28,581
-What are you doing?
-I'm talking. What are you doing?

603
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:30,667
-Is this your fighter?
-It's my fighter.

604
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,170
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

605
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:37,507
Fine, you take her.
She can't fight worth a shit anyway.

606
00:44:37,715 --> 00:44:42,053
-Somebody tell me what's going on.
-I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

607
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,681
You telling me this is your fighter?

608
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:49,227
Yeah, this is my fighter.

609
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:51,145
Then you got 10 seconds.

610
00:44:51,396 --> 00:44:54,566
I keep holding my left up,
then I throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

611
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:56,818
-Well, let it drop.
-That'd be a lot easier.

612
00:44:57,026 --> 00:44:58,194
She thinks she knows you.

613
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:01,364
Every time you drop it,
she comes right over the top.

614
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:04,742
So you just wait for her, see?
That's all she's thinking about.

615
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:07,912
-When she cocks that right hand-- You hear?
-I hear you, boss.

616
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,082
When she does, step to the side
and come with a good-night hook.

617
00:45:11,249 --> 00:45:12,625
-Got one?
-Got it right here.

618
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,587
-Okay.
-Fight, or I'm calling it.

619
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:18,715
<i>-Go give it to her.
-The body knows what fighters don't.</i>

620
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,091
<i>How to protect itself.</i>

621
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,052
<i>A neck can only twist so far.</i>

622
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:26,431
<i>Twist it just a hair more,
and the body says:</i>

623
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,810
<i>"Hey, I'll take it from here because you
obviously don't know what you're doing. "</i>

624
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,812
Neutral corner.

625
00:45:34,272 --> 00:45:36,149
-See the way she did that?
-Yeah.

626
00:45:36,274 --> 00:45:39,235
Sugar Ray would do that.
Girl's got sugar.

627
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:45,116
<i>"Lie down, now, rest, and we'll talk
about this when you regain your senses. "</i>

628
00:45:45,283 --> 00:45:47,452
<i>It's called the knockout mechanism.</i>

629
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:51,372
Don't get all carried away, now.
You did good.

630
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,500
Thanks, boss.

631
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,211
You.... You forgot the rule.

632
00:45:56,377 --> 00:45:58,755
-Now, what is the rule?
-Keep my left up?

633
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:01,925
It's to protect yourself at all times.

634
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,052
Now, what is the rule?

635
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,597
-Protect myself at all times.
-Good, good.

636
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,933
You gave me away.
How was that protecting me?

637
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:12,810
It wasn't.

638
00:46:13,895 --> 00:46:15,396
It's okay.

639
00:46:16,147 --> 00:46:19,984
-I'll work on my left, boss.
-Drink your water.

640
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,821
Other than that, how'd I do?

641
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:26,115
Fine. You did fine.

642
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,576
You gonna leave me again?

643
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,413
Never.

644
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,960
That place you work, do they have
homemade lemon meringue pie there?

645
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:40,171
-Sure.
-Not the kind with the canned-filling crap?

646
00:46:40,338 --> 00:46:43,967
Oh, big can, yay size.
Says "homemade" on the label.

647
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:49,514
-I want you to take the weekend off.
-It's only Thursday.

648
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:54,394
-You gonna argue with me?
-Know better than to do that, boss.

649
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,771
Well, good.

650
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:59,649
<i>All fighters are pigheaded
some way or other.</i>

651
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:03,486
<i>Some part of them always thinks
they know better than you about something.</i>

652
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,949
Can you spare a few minutes
for the Immaculate Conception?

653
00:47:09,534 --> 00:47:13,371
<i>Truth is, even if they're wrong...</i>

654
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:16,541
<i>...even if that one thing
is gonna be the ruin of them...</i>

655
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:21,546
<i>...if you can beat that last bit out of them,
then they ain't fighters at all.</i>

656
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,049
-Thought I said I'd see you Monday.
-You sure did, boss.

657
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:26,885
That was last night.

658
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:29,846
You said not to argue with you.

659
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,985
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

660
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,112
You want my advice?

661
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:47,739
What?

662
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,158
Where are your shoes?

663
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:53,578
I'm airing out my feet.

664
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:57,165
You got big holes in your socks.

665
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,168
Oh, they're not that big.

666
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:04,214
Didn't I give you money
for some new ones?

667
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,550
These are my sleeping socks.

668
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:11,596
My feet like a little air at night.

669
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,432
How come you're wearing them
in the daytime, then?

670
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:17,602
Because my daytime socks
got too many holes in them.

671
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:25,485
Well, if I give you some more money,
you buy some new socks.

672
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,445
Please?

673
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:33,660
Well, I'd be tempted,
but I couldn't say for sure.

674
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,745
Might find its way to the track.

675
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,473
It's over. It's over.

676
00:49:10,363 --> 00:49:12,991
<i>Didn't take Maggie long
to hit her stride.</i>

677
00:49:24,502 --> 00:49:25,879
I got the breathing thing down.

678
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,632
No, you ain't breathing because you're
knocking them out in the first round.

679
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:33,303
-Thought that was the point.
-The point is to get good.

680
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,598
Can't get good if you keep
knocking them out first round.

681
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:38,975
How am I gonna get you fights?

682
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,062
Nobody wants to see
their fighter embarrassed, now.

683
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,857
Why am I still doing
four-rounders, boss?

684
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:48,610
Because you haven't got the lungs
for six rounds.

685
00:49:48,818 --> 00:49:52,030
I do if I keep knocking them out
in the first round.

686
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,204
<i>Frankie made her fight
one more four-rounder...</i>

687
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,498
<i>...just to let her know who was boss.</i>

688
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:08,546
Three, four, five...

689
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:10,840
...six, seven....

690
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,634
Sorry, boss.

691
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,844
<i>Maggie left no doubt about it.</i>

692
00:50:23,811 --> 00:50:27,023
All right, let's do it.

693
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:32,153
<i>Her first six-rounder
didn't go quite as smooth.</i>

694
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,711
Get up!

695
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:50,547
To your corner.

696
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:53,883
-Three, four, five...
-Get up.

697
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,344
-...six, seven...
-Get up.

698
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,556
-...eight, nine, ten. It's over.
-You can do this.

699
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:05,270
<i>Maggie didn't knock her out
till the end of the first round.</i>

700
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:09,607
<i>After that, no manager wanted
to put his fighter in with Maggie.</i>

701
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,739
<i>Frankie had to go into his pocket
to get her decent fights...</i>

702
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:20,910
<i>...sweetening the purse
by paying managers on the side.</i>

703
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,383
<i>That only worked for so long.</i>

704
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,678
<i>Then Frankie did something
he hated doing.</i>

705
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:39,888
<i>He took a chance.</i>

706
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,475
Box.

707
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:51,274
<i>He moved her up in class.</i>

708
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:54,319
<i>That could've been a mistake.</i>

709
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,625
Watch the right!

710
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,129
Watch it. Watch it.

711
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:23,973
Break, break. Step back. Break. Time.

712
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,984
Damn, damn, damn.

713
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,905
Give us two seconds, will you?

714
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,824
-Okay.
-Just two seconds.

715
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,827
-Your nose is broke.
-Oh, damn.

716
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,787
-Fix it.
-I can't, I can't.

717
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,498
-You can fix it.
-I can't. I've gotta call it.

718
00:52:48,706 --> 00:52:50,583
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

719
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,795
I can snap it back into place,
but I can't stop the bleeding.

720
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,505
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

721
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,925
Please, Frankie, if you
can stop the blood, I can beat her.

722
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,220
Bite down on this.

723
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,865
-Inhale.
-What?

724
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,491
-Inhale.
-What?

725
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:25,618
Breathe in.

726
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,632
-Okay, huh?
-Yeah, it's okay.

727
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,927
All right, you got 20 seconds
before this turns into a geyser...

728
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,221
...and it's gonna spray
all over the front row.

729
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,640
Twenty seconds, that's all you've got.

730
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,517
Now get going.

731
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,115
Go to your corner.

732
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:08,077
Three, four, five...

733
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:11,915
-Come on, breathe. Breathe.
-...six, seven, eight...

734
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,209
...nine, ten.

735
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,047
<i>Mo cuishle.</i>

736
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,387
-All right!
-Yeah!

737
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,641
Right.

738
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:35,647
What you reading?

739
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,816
What's she saying?

740
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,652
Wants to know what you're reading.

741
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,780
It's Yeats. Keep your head back.

742
00:54:44,697 --> 00:54:46,616
Why don't you talk
a little Yeats to her.

743
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,410
Show her what a treat that is.

744
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,996
When the hell they gonna get to her?

745
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,374
I'm okay, Frankie.

746
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,127
-What'd you learn tonight?
-Always protect myself.

747
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:01,381
-What's the rule?
-Always protect myself.

748
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,424
-Margaret Fitzgerald?
-Here.

749
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,889
I'll be right here.

750
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,320
-How you doing?
-Me?

751
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,447
-Yeah, you.
-I'm not the one who's hurt.

752
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,121
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

753
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,166
Why are you telling me that?

754
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,669
No reason.

755
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:44,090
<i>But some wounds are too deep
or too close to the bone.</i>

756
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:48,887
<i>And no matter how hard you work at it,
you just can't stop the bleeding.</i>

757
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,432
-Did you write your daughter?
-Every week.

758
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:56,978
I've no idea why you come to church.

759
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:32,931
<i>After her 12th straight knockout,
Frankie got a couple of real good offers.</i>

760
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,102
<i>The first was to fight
Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman...</i>

761
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,563
<i>...for the WBA welterweight title.</i>

762
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,359
Billie "The Blue Bear."

763
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,612
<i>Billie was a former prostitute
out of East Berlin.</i>

764
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,991
<i>Had a reputation for being
the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.</i>

765
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,886
<i>Didn't seem to matter to her...</i>

766
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,681
<i>...that something like that
could kill a person.</i>

767
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,809
<i>And the crowds loved her.</i>

768
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,648
<i>He turned it down
without even telling her.</i>

769
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,151
<i>The next was to fight
the British champ...</i>

770
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,571
<i>-...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.
-Hello?</i>

771
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,365
Not interested.

772
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,745
<i>He turned that down too.</i>

773
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,292
That's a lot of money, boss.

774
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:45,879
Yeah, you're making money.
What are you still working here for?

775
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,755
It's a title match, right?

776
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,925
Are you British?
It's a title you can't take away.

777
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,470
She's got nothing to lose,
you got nothing to win.

778
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,807
Might still be a good fight.

779
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,478
Yeah, I just-- I just brought you up
to welterweight.

780
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:05,106
Too good to fight these contenders,
you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

781
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,276
Didn't notice I was fighting
any contenders.

782
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,280
Well, you can get yourself
another manager any time you want.

783
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,284
In fact, if you'd learn
to protect your face a little better...

784
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,995
...I wouldn't have
to turn down this money.

785
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,877
My face is out there so much it's a miracle
I haven't been knocked out yet.

786
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,617
No, you can't work here
anymore tonight.

787
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,495
I made us a reservation.

788
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,332
You might wanna shower.

789
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,856
Here you go.

790
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,899
Here you go.

791
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,110
What's this?

792
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,572
Well, it ain't no big secret
what you're wishing for.

793
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,574
Go on and blow.

794
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,247
Thank you.

795
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,837
Thirty-three ain't so old.

796
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,424
I was still fighting at 39.

797
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,219
Fought for 23 years.

798
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,641
How's it going, Scrap?

799
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,477
Doing good, Mickey.

800
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,354
Doing good.

801
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,275
-What'll you have?
-Coffee.

802
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,074
You two not speaking?

803
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,744
Don't hardly know him.

804
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:31,878
I met Frankie right after
my 37th birthday.

805
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,423
He was picking up cut work.

806
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:40,136
He used to patch me up
when I thought it was impossible.

807
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,473
Good man to have in your corner.

808
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,351
Yes, he is.

809
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,147
He stayed with me
through my last fight in San Berdu.

810
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,360
My manager was off
getting drunk somewhere...

811
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:59,405
...and it was just Frankie and me.

812
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:04,077
I was taking a hellacious beating.

813
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:08,873
Everybody's got a particular number
of fights in him.

814
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:12,502
Nobody tells you what that number is.

815
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:16,130
Mine was 109.

816
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,008
I just didn't want to admit it.

817
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,096
Fourth round, this...

818
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,223
...cut opens up.

819
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,476
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

820
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:34,357
They should've stopped the fight, but,
hell, I was a black man in San Berdu.

821
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,693
Blood was what I was there for.

822
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,156
Round after round, I kept getting
Frankie to patch me up.

823
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,741
He's talking about
throwing in the towel...

824
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:47,245
...but he ain't my manager,
he can't throw in nothing.

825
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,540
Round after round...

826
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,001
...he's arguing with me.

827
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:58,506
And I'm almost laughing because, hell,
it's getting more to him than to me.

828
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,926
I go 15 rounds...

829
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,304
...Iose by decision.

830
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:07,348
Next morning, I lose the eye.

831
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:13,354
In 23 years, he's never said
a thing about it.

832
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:18,401
Doesn't have to. I can see it
in his face every time he looks at me.

833
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,070
Somehow...

834
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,657
...Frankie thinks he should've
stopped that fight...

835
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,911
...should've saved my eye.

836
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:34,209
Spends his life wishing he could
take back that 109th fight.

837
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,962
I wanted to go to 110.

838
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,590
Thing is...

839
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,051
...if you wanna get to the title...

840
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,013
...maybe he's not the one
to take you there.

841
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,354
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

842
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,818
You go on, eat your cupcake.

843
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:02,737
No, I got it.

844
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,619
<i>It's the rule.</i>

845
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,247
<i>Always protect yourself.</i>

846
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,583
<i>People never take their own advice.</i>

847
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,797
<i>If she was gonna leave Frankie,
better she did it to him then.</i>

848
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,136
Mr. Mickey Mack?

849
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,639
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

850
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:35,687
I hear you're a real good manager,
doing good things for Big Willie.

851
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:39,149
But I thought you should know
I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn...

852
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,111
...so you don't need to make any more
excuses to bump into me.

853
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,574
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

854
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:55,415
<i>Maggie always did like
taking them out in the first round.</i>

855
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:32,535
<i>The letters always came back
marked the same way:</i>

856
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,871
<i>"Return to sender. "</i>

857
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,903
I'll make you some coffee.

858
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,573
What are you doing with your money?

859
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,284
-Saving it.
-Good girl.

860
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,540
You know, you save enough of it,
you ought to get yourself a little house.

861
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,999
Cash, no mortgage.

862
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,752
Gonna be a while before I can do that.

863
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,092
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch...

864
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,886
...but you gotta get yourself
a place of your own.

865
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:35,306
Go around wasting it on things
that don't matter and what do you got?

866
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,183
You understand?

867
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:41,271
Pretty soon, you wait long enough,
you got nothing.

868
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,398
Okay, soon as I get the money.

869
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:47,610
I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just
trying to keep you from doing the same.

870
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,696
I know, boss.

871
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,533
-I'm not gonna live forever.
-What is it?

872
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,369
It's a tape on that girl in England
you're gonna fight.

873
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,831
If you're gonna go for the title,
we got some moves to-- Hey.

874
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,709
Hey, get the hell down.
You know how old I am?

875
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:05,503
-Thank you, boss. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

876
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:10,091
You're welcome, darling. Here, just--
Here, let me put this in the machine.

877
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,260
What machine?

878
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,470
Don't have a TV, huh?

879
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,389
No.

880
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,850
Yeah!

881
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,061
All right. Okay.

882
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,570
-Ten minutes, love.
-Thank you.

883
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,363
Man says he loves me.

884
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,574
He's probably not
the first one to say that.

885
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,035
First since my daddy.

886
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,329
I win, you think he'll propose?

887
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,789
You win, I'll propose.

888
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,587
Look, I got you a gift here.

889
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,636
I think they gave you somebody else's.

890
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,763
No, no, this is it.

891
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,265
What's it mean?

892
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:03,228
I don't know.
Just something in Gaelic.

893
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:07,899
-It's beautiful.
-Yeah, I thought so.

894
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,901
-Yeah.
-Real silk thread.

895
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:17,867
From the United States
of America, the challenger...

896
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,371
...Maggie Fitzgerald.

897
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,208
<i>Mo cuishle.
Did you see what was on her robe?</i>

898
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,627
<i>-Mo cuishle. Mo cuishle.
-Mo cuishle.</i>

899
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,675
<i>She wasn't the main attraction.</i>

900
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:37,554
<i>She was on the undercard
of a middleweight title fight.</i>

901
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,889
<i>But ask someone who was there...</i>

902
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:43,059
<i>...they couldn't tell you who else
fought that night.</i>

903
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,900
Box.

904
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,964
<i>-Come on!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

905
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,844
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

906
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,638
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

907
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,057
<i>Mo cuishle!</i>

908
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:27,896
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

909
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,448
She's tough.

910
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,619
I can't get inside.
I can't get close enough to hit her.

911
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,205
-You know why that is?
-Why?

912
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,624
She's a better fighter than you are.

913
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,878
She's younger, she's stronger,
and she's more experienced. Now...

914
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:54,255
...what are you gonna do about it?

915
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,057
Get in there.

916
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,351
Box.

917
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:24,786
Three, four, five, six...

918
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:30,083
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

919
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:34,379
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

920
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,848
<i>-Mo cuishle!
-Mo cuishle!</i>

921
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,190
I could ask someone, you know?

922
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,109
Good.

923
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,319
You find out, you let me know.

924
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:08,329
<i>Whatever it meant, the name stuck.</i>

925
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:13,001
<i>Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam.</i>

926
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,004
<i>It was always mo cuishle.</i>

927
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:18,631
<i>Seems there are
Irish people everywhere...</i>

928
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,092
<i>...or people who wanna be.</i>

929
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,012
<i>By the time they came back
to the States...</i>

930
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:27,974
<i>...Maggie was in a whole new league.</i>

931
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:49,537
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

932
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:02,550
<i>After that they got another offer
to fight for the title.</i>

933
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,805
What's the split?

934
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,808
-Sixty-forty.
-Good.

935
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:13,937
We'll take 60 and you take 40,
being as that Maggie's the draw.

936
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,855
That little girl?

937
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:19,609
You think I'm wrong, really?
You think people are saying...

938
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:23,571
...that they wanna see some scabby Kraut
beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

939
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:26,783
You find someone who says that,
and we'll take the 40.

940
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,042
There you go.

941
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:42,715
They're at 60-40,
but they'll come up to 50-50.

942
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:45,260
How's that girl doing?

943
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:48,555
Well, she's got a concussion
and a broken eardrum.

944
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,640
She be all right?

945
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,727
-And if she isn't?
-Maybe I should send her something.

946
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:59,023
Well, you could send her your check
if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

947
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,822
Boss?

948
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,866
That little house we talked about?

949
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:09,701
I bought it.

950
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:12,745
Well, smart girl.

951
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:17,208
For my mama. It's only about a mile
from where she lives now.

952
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,460
No mortgage, just like you said.

953
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,840
You're a good daughter.

954
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:26,551
She don't know about it yet.

955
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:30,305
I was hoping maybe we could
stay an extra day, drive over there?

956
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:32,390
I know she wants to meet you.

957
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,604
Yeah, we could do that.

958
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,832
Oh, my God. Mama, come on out here.

959
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,168
Mary M.'s here.

960
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:21,314
-This is the Johnsons' old house.
-Not anymore.

961
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:28,822
It's all yours, Mama.
For you and Mardell and the kids.

962
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:32,826
-Mary M., you bought this for me?
-Yeah, all yours, free and clear.

963
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,702
Darling....

964
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,205
There's no fridge. No stove neither.

965
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:39,666
They'll be here before you move in.

966
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,253
-How much money did this cost you?
-Never mind that.

967
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,130
-You shouldn't have done this.
-You need a decent place.

968
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:49,634
You shouldn't have done it.
You should've asked me first.

969
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,222
Government's gonna find out about this,
they're gonna stop my welfare.

970
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:58,268
-Mama, no, they ain't.
-They are. You're fine, you're working...

971
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,270
...but I can't live without my welfare.

972
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:02,105
Mama, I'll send you money.

973
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:05,650
What about my medicine?
Medicaid gonna cut me off.

974
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:09,487
-How am I supposed to get my medicine?
-I'll send you more money.

975
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:12,115
I hope you don't expect J.D.
to move in with us.

976
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:13,533
He's getting out, you know.

977
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,703
Why didn't you just give me the money?

978
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:20,373
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

979
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:26,045
I didn't have to, Mama, but it's yours.

980
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:28,423
You want the money, sell it.

981
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,598
I don't--

982
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,064
I know you didn't mean
nothing hurtful...

983
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,650
...but sometimes you just
don't think things through.

984
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:51,321
-That's true, Mama.
-I'll try and keep the house.

985
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,157
I'm just worried about
all those expenses.

986
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,242
I'll send you some more money.

987
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,670
That man hitting you?

988
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,341
It's from the fight.

989
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:13,301
I'm a fighter, Mama.

990
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,095
Find a man, Mary M.

991
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:17,931
Live proper.

992
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:21,100
People hear about what you're doing
and they laugh.

993
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:24,354
Hurts me to tell you,
but they laugh at you.

994
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,866
Hi.

995
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:50,273
You ever own a dog?

996
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,941
Nope.

997
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:56,738
Closest I ever came was
a middleweight from Barstow.

998
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:03,119
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

999
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:05,038
Axel's hindquarters were so bad...

1000
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:08,791
...he had to drag himself
room to room by his front legs.

1001
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,961
Me and Mardell would bust up laughing...

1002
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,924
...watching him scoot
across the kitchen floor.

1003
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:20,220
Daddy, he was so sick by then,
he couldn't hardly stand himself.

1004
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:25,141
But one morning he got up,
carried Axel to his rig...

1005
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:29,687
...and the two of them went off
into the woods, singing and howling.

1006
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,942
But it wasn't till he got home
that night alone that I saw...

1007
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,736
...the shovel in the back of the truck.

1008
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:44,494
Sure miss watching
the two of them together.

1009
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:55,964
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1010
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:01,136
Well, you've got me.

1011
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:07,767
At least, that is,
until we find you a good manager.

1012
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:19,654
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1013
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,698
Yeah.

1014
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:25,201
This place has
the best lemon pie around.

1015
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:28,329
None of that canned-filling crap.

1016
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:45,555
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1017
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:52,353
I used to come here with Daddy.

1018
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,107
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1019
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,818
I got a little bit of savings.

1020
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,369
That's fine, fine, thanks.

1021
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:15,210
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1022
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:18,254
Looks like another bottle of water.

1023
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,715
Wanna come to Vegas with us?

1024
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:25,845
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots?
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1025
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,682
Well, she's got a title shot.
The Blue Bear.

1026
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:31,851
Million dollars,
split right down the center.

1027
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,853
That's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1028
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,605
Well, I could use a good second.

1029
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,565
Can't find one,
I thought I'd ask you.

1030
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,818
Now, why the hell
would I wanna do that?

1031
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:44,364
Well, because you're a half-blind old fool
who never got there himself.

1032
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:48,284
I thought you might like to feel what
it's like to be in a ring on a title match.

1033
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,453
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1034
01:19:51,663 --> 01:19:54,123
No, you pick up somebody
there in Vegas.

1035
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,377
Somebody with young hands.

1036
01:19:57,502 --> 01:20:00,547
You're not gonna cry now, are you?
I've already got one girl.

1037
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,259
I leave this place for one day...

1038
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:07,262
...got any idea what it would look like
when I come back?

1039
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,264
Kind of like it looks right now.

1040
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,849
Oh, go to hell.

1041
01:20:12,684 --> 01:20:15,770
You tell Maggie don't come back here
without a belt.

1042
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,772
Will do.

1043
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:23,820
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1044
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:27,240
I got a question,
but I feel real stupid asking it.

1045
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,659
No such thing as
a stupid question there, Danger.

1046
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,619
Okay.

1047
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:37,959
How'd you get all the ice in here
through this little tiny hole?

1048
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:40,211
I've been thinking on it.

1049
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,130
Can't figure it out.

1050
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,965
Why don't I show you, Danger.

1051
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:47,427
-You could do that? You could show me?
-I think so. I think so.

1052
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:52,640
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking
I might be ready for a fight.

1053
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,980
Well, I got the tickets. You ready?

1054
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:02,066
-We're flying?
-Would you rather drive?

1055
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,153
You're asking me?

1056
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,573
Would you rather fly,
or would you rather drive?

1057
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,493
So I finally get to decide something?

1058
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:13,036
That's what I'm saying.

1059
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:14,829
Fine.

1060
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,748
Fly there, drive back.

1061
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:20,793
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
How the hell we gonna do that?

1062
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,712
You said it was up to me.

1063
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:35,141
Give them hell there, Danger.

1064
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:38,311
Hey, old school,
the toilet's overflowing.

1065
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:45,485
Hey, Flippy, come here for a minute.

1066
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:49,197
Jesus.

1067
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:52,075
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1068
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:54,702
Oh, God!

1069
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,375
Dumb-ass.

1070
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:03,169
Come on, Danger. Come on, Danger.

1071
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:04,796
Come on. Defense!

1072
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,715
Could be sitting up at the Mirage...

1073
01:22:08,508 --> 01:22:10,426
...drinking mai tais...

1074
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:12,804
...Iooking at naked women.

1075
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:16,182
Come on, Danger,
put up your hands and fight.

1076
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,895
Danger, get out of there!

1077
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:30,071
Fight back! Come on!

1078
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,907
-There you go, Danger, there you go!
-Good job, man.

1079
01:22:33,575 --> 01:22:35,076
Jab him with the left.
Come on.

1080
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:36,494
Come on.

1081
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,130
Hey, come on now, Flip.

1082
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:49,424
-What you doing? Let him go.
-All right. Okay.

1083
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,926
I got you. Come on, come on.

1084
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:55,054
It's all right.

1085
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,099
We don't need no corner trainer.

1086
01:22:58,308 --> 01:22:59,642
How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1087
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,728
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1088
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:04,022
You my man. You rock.

1089
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:06,149
Come on, Flip, man, you ain't done.

1090
01:23:06,274 --> 01:23:09,068
You ain't even fight good yet.

1091
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:11,154
Anybody can lose one fight.

1092
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,823
Anybody can lose one, son.
You'll come back from this.

1093
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,575
You'll be champion of the world.

1094
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:18,077
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1095
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,705
I should have knowed.

1096
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:23,458
-Come on. We don't need to be talking.
-Let me help you.

1097
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:27,170
Oh, no, I can do her.
Just untie the Velcro for me.

1098
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:29,255
All right.

1099
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:34,177
Come on, don't take the gloves off, man.
You ain't even used them, Danger.

1100
01:23:35,637 --> 01:23:38,348
Mind if I borrow this, Danger?

1101
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:41,309
Man, I thought your name was Danger.

1102
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,603
Come on, now.

1103
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:47,774
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight
a retard and a old man.

1104
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:51,945
Call ESPN, because you can't
write this shit.

1105
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:02,831
Look out, Shawrelle. Easy, Shawrelle.

1106
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:05,250
Keep going, man.

1107
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,168
All right, man.

1108
01:24:14,509 --> 01:24:15,969
He ain't so tough.

1109
01:24:16,344 --> 01:24:18,263
One hundred and ten.

1110
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:24,811
Get a job, punk.

1111
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:59,262
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1112
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:02,348
I got you some pipers.

1113
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:19,866
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1114
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:24,370
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1115
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:34,631
All right, now!

1116
01:26:24,514 --> 01:26:26,933
I want you to jab her right in the tits...

1117
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,185
...until they turn blue and fall off.

1118
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:48,663
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the feature...</i>

1119
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,124
...presentation of the evening.

1120
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:55,795
In this corner, the challenger,
Maggie Fitzgerald...

1121
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:58,047
...in the red corner.

1122
01:26:58,256 --> 01:26:59,841
In the blue corner...

1123
01:27:00,008 --> 01:27:04,387
...the WBA welterweight champion
of the world...

1124
01:27:04,554 --> 01:27:07,432
...Billie "The Blue Bear."

1125
01:27:10,602 --> 01:27:12,395
Sweet Jesus.

1126
01:27:28,036 --> 01:27:31,539
<i>Fitzgerald is pushing The Blue Bear
around the ring. She's coming on strong.</i>

1127
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:37,504
Challenger darts in, lands a combination
to the head and the body.

1128
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:39,756
<i>-And a right hook stuns the champ.
-All right.</i>

1129
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:43,134
Break it up!

1130
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:48,097
Break it! Break it!

1131
01:27:54,103 --> 01:27:56,981
Do that one more time,
it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1132
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:00,443
Go fight.

1133
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:10,245
You motherfucker.

1134
01:28:18,419 --> 01:28:20,880
Come on. What the fuck?

1135
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:23,716
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna take away a point.

1136
01:28:23,967 --> 01:28:26,177
One point deduction
off the blue corner.

1137
01:28:27,804 --> 01:28:29,389
<i>--comes back, hits Fitzgerald....</i>

1138
01:28:29,556 --> 01:28:30,974
Ref, open your eyes, you....

1139
01:28:48,992 --> 01:28:52,745
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the first round
is in the books on this championship match.</i>

1140
01:28:56,249 --> 01:28:58,626
-Hold onto that.
-There you go.

1141
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:05,800
-Looking good.
-You pull that crap one more time...

1142
01:29:05,967 --> 01:29:07,719
...you're disqualified.

1143
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,562
It's gonna be all right.

1144
01:29:17,687 --> 01:29:19,481
Got no doubt, boss.

1145
01:29:22,358 --> 01:29:24,861
Okay, just watch yourself.

1146
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:26,488
Stay away from this dame.

1147
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,669
Go to the neutral corner.
Neutral corner.

1148
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:46,007
-Four, five, six...
-Stay down, you bitch.

1149
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:49,552
...seven, eight, nine.

1150
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:03,983
Yeah, yeah!

1151
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,153
Break it! Break it!

1152
01:30:14,077 --> 01:30:17,831
<i>Fitzgerald continues to pummel
The Blue Bear. The East German champion....</i>

1153
01:30:31,678 --> 01:30:33,388
Yes! Come on!

1154
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:35,098
I got it! I got it.

1155
01:30:41,855 --> 01:30:43,231
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1156
01:30:43,398 --> 01:30:46,192
-How many eyes you need to finish this?
-One's enough.

1157
01:30:49,571 --> 01:30:51,239
-Good.
-Now...

1158
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:52,949
...what do I do about the Bear?

1159
01:30:53,116 --> 01:30:56,077
Do you know that step into the outside
and hook into the liver?

1160
01:30:56,244 --> 01:30:59,789
-I been doing that. She's made of steel.
-I don't want you to go to the liver.

1161
01:30:59,998 --> 01:31:02,876
I want you to hit her right up
under her skinny ass, understand?

1162
01:31:03,126 --> 01:31:06,171
Right in the sciatic nerve.
Just keep digging it in there.

1163
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:08,423
And just keep sticking her.
You hear that?

1164
01:31:08,798 --> 01:31:11,593
-What about the ref?
-Keep between the ref and the Bear...

1165
01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:13,511
...and everything will just be fine.

1166
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,557
This is yours. You keep your guard up.

1167
01:31:17,724 --> 01:31:19,225
You keep it up.

1168
01:31:32,864 --> 01:31:34,240
Oh, yeah!

1169
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,878
Break, break!

1170
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:57,347
<i>Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!</i>

1171
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:28,586
Doctor.

1172
01:32:43,393 --> 01:32:44,644
Come on.

1173
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:46,521
Breathe.

1174
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:49,274
That's it. Breathe.

1175
01:32:49,732 --> 01:32:51,359
Good.

1176
01:32:51,568 --> 01:32:53,027
Look at me. Concentrate on me.

1177
01:32:53,862 --> 01:32:55,029
Breathe.

1178
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,282
Good.

1179
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,033
That's it.

1180
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,703
Breathe.

1181
01:33:50,126 --> 01:33:51,920
How you feeling, darling?

1182
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,764
Growing a beard, boss?

1183
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:06,392
I thought it might help me
with the ladies.

1184
01:34:08,353 --> 01:34:10,563
Can't say it does.

1185
01:34:37,966 --> 01:34:40,385
Does it--? Does it hurt much?

1186
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,389
Don't hurt at all.

1187
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:47,976
Well, that's good.

1188
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:55,233
Where's Frankie?

1189
01:34:57,318 --> 01:34:58,778
Well, he's....

1190
01:34:58,945 --> 01:35:01,322
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1191
01:35:01,489 --> 01:35:04,576
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1192
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:11,207
They're telling him
I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1193
01:35:14,461 --> 01:35:19,174
Means that my spinal cord's so broke
they'll never be able to fix it.

1194
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:26,389
Gonna be frozen like this
the rest of my life.

1195
01:35:31,394 --> 01:35:35,231
I asked them to tell him.
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

1196
01:35:43,698 --> 01:35:45,700
Did you see the fight?

1197
01:35:48,286 --> 01:35:49,996
Of course I did.

1198
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:52,957
You had her cold, Maggie.

1199
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:57,504
I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1200
01:36:01,424 --> 01:36:03,593
I shouldn't have turned.

1201
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,435
Always protect myself.

1202
01:36:12,602 --> 01:36:15,730
How many times he tell me that?

1203
01:36:16,898 --> 01:36:18,358
Yeah...

1204
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,569
...he does like to repeat himself.

1205
01:36:25,365 --> 01:36:28,701
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1206
01:36:32,747 --> 01:36:34,207
No.

1207
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:37,168
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1208
01:36:57,313 --> 01:36:58,857
Damnedest thing.

1209
01:37:02,735 --> 01:37:04,487
So, what's the plan?

1210
01:37:05,363 --> 01:37:08,658
I know you got one,
so you might as well tell me what it is.

1211
01:37:08,825 --> 01:37:10,618
It's your fault.

1212
01:37:11,161 --> 01:37:14,164
Yeah, it's your fault
she's lying in there like that.

1213
01:37:14,372 --> 01:37:16,291
You kept after me until I trained her.

1214
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:19,752
I knew I shouldn't have done it,
her being a girl and all.

1215
01:37:20,795 --> 01:37:23,214
Everything kept telling me not to.

1216
01:37:23,381 --> 01:37:25,175
Everything but you.

1217
01:37:35,602 --> 01:37:37,312
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1218
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:39,439
These doctors around here
don't know squat.

1219
01:37:39,564 --> 01:37:42,567
Otherwise, why would they be
living out here in the desert?

1220
01:37:43,443 --> 01:37:45,653
As soon as you're able to be moved...

1221
01:37:46,029 --> 01:37:49,657
...we'll find some place where
they've actually studied medicine.

1222
01:37:52,535 --> 01:37:54,496
You just rest there, I'II....

1223
01:37:56,289 --> 01:37:57,874
I'm on it.

1224
01:38:06,966 --> 01:38:09,302
<i>Frankie must have called
every hospital in America...</i>

1225
01:38:09,552 --> 01:38:12,305
<i>...looking for somebody
who'd tell him they could fix her.</i>

1226
01:38:12,514 --> 01:38:16,559
<i>He came close twice,
till they checked her over...</i>

1227
01:38:16,893 --> 01:38:18,895
<i>...said there was nothing to be done.</i>

1228
01:38:19,354 --> 01:38:22,565
<i>Took two months till she was
stable enough to move.</i>

1229
01:38:27,904 --> 01:38:30,406
They got nurses for that, you know.

1230
01:38:31,825 --> 01:38:34,118
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1231
01:38:46,256 --> 01:38:50,552
<i>She developed skin ulcers
because she couldn't change positions.</i>

1232
01:39:01,604 --> 01:39:03,189
Thank you.

1233
01:39:13,158 --> 01:39:16,494
<i>They made the six-hour trip
by ambulance.</i>

1234
01:39:27,881 --> 01:39:30,758
Fly there, drive back.

1235
01:39:37,098 --> 01:39:40,560
<i>The rehab center Frankie found
was a nice place.</i>

1236
01:39:41,019 --> 01:39:42,854
<i>They took good care of Maggie.</i>

1237
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:45,064
<i>She wouldn't have complained
if they hadn't.</i>

1238
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:50,320
<i>Took several hours every day
to get her ready for the wheelchair.</i>

1239
01:39:55,575 --> 01:39:57,869
One, two, three, up.

1240
01:40:00,288 --> 01:40:02,582
<i>Since she couldn't breathe on her own...</i>

1241
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,418
<i>...her respirators were always on.</i>

1242
01:40:06,628 --> 01:40:10,465
<i>Oxygen was pumped into her
24 hours a day.</i>

1243
01:40:36,658 --> 01:40:40,036
<i>Maggie's mama called to say
they were all coming for a visit.</i>

1244
01:40:40,161 --> 01:40:43,832
<i>She waited by the window
every day for the next two weeks.</i>

1245
01:40:44,833 --> 01:40:46,126
Sure.

1246
01:40:46,251 --> 01:40:48,878
<i>Frankie finally tracked them down.</i>

1247
01:40:49,045 --> 01:40:53,049
<i>Learned they'd checked into their hotel
six days earlier.</i>

1248
01:40:53,216 --> 01:40:56,553
<i>Kept leaving messages
which were never returned.</i>

1249
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:03,351
You don't have to hang around all day.

1250
01:41:07,188 --> 01:41:10,150
I like it here. I don't mind.

1251
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:14,821
In fact, if you weren't here,
I'd come here anyway to read my books.

1252
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,702
Mama will be here soon
to share some of the burden.

1253
01:41:21,035 --> 01:41:22,871
Well, it's no burden.

1254
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:25,206
Here.

1255
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,585
Read this.

1256
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,846
Okay, okay, that's enough.

1257
01:41:40,305 --> 01:41:41,764
That's terrible.

1258
01:41:44,267 --> 01:41:47,270
Anyway, I'll tell you in English
what you were saying.

1259
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:51,608
It says:

1260
01:41:51,774 --> 01:41:55,361
<i>I will arise and go now
And go to Innisfree</i>

1261
01:41:55,570 --> 01:42:00,074
<i>And a small cabin build there
Of clay and wattles made</i>

1262
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:05,413
<i>And I shall have some peace there
For peace comes dropping slow</i>

1263
01:42:05,955 --> 01:42:10,710
<i>Dropping from the veils of the morning
To where the cricket sings.</i>

1264
01:42:13,046 --> 01:42:14,464
Not bad, huh?

1265
01:42:18,968 --> 01:42:21,137
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1266
01:42:21,805 --> 01:42:23,640
-Me?
-Yeah.

1267
01:42:26,017 --> 01:42:28,770
You know, when you quit all this.

1268
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:32,357
You mean boxing?

1269
01:42:32,941 --> 01:42:35,527
No, I'll never quit.

1270
01:42:36,528 --> 01:42:39,072
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1271
01:42:44,953 --> 01:42:47,455
You think?
Because I could see you there real easy...

1272
01:42:47,664 --> 01:42:49,999
...with your books and lemon pie.

1273
01:42:52,168 --> 01:42:55,088
How about you?
Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1274
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:59,384
I could learn how to bake.

1275
01:43:03,346 --> 01:43:04,848
Well, then, I'II....

1276
01:43:05,014 --> 01:43:07,142
Maybe I'll start looking then.

1277
01:43:28,913 --> 01:43:30,415
Yeah.

1278
01:43:33,209 --> 01:43:35,587
-Go ahead.
-All right. Okay, sounds good.

1279
01:43:39,507 --> 01:43:41,843
Hi, I'm Frankie Dunn.
I met you back out in Missouri.

1280
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:43,344
Where's my little girl?

1281
01:43:43,553 --> 01:43:46,347
Don't you think you ought to go back
to the hotel and change?

1282
01:43:46,556 --> 01:43:49,309
She doesn't know you've been here
a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1283
01:43:49,476 --> 01:43:52,937
We got business with my sister.
Why don't you just tell us where she is.

1284
01:43:53,062 --> 01:43:55,857
Oh, you must be J.D.
And you must be the business guy?

1285
01:43:56,024 --> 01:43:57,442
There's some rides you missed.

1286
01:43:57,609 --> 01:44:00,236
Why don't you go back.
I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1287
01:44:00,445 --> 01:44:02,697
I drove all the way here
to take care of my child.

1288
01:44:02,906 --> 01:44:05,033
And you're suggesting
I'm not a good mother?

1289
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,868
Mary M. can't go nowhere.

1290
01:44:07,035 --> 01:44:10,038
If we could've taken her to Disneyland,
we would've.

1291
01:44:11,539 --> 01:44:12,749
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1292
01:44:13,249 --> 01:44:14,918
Right down here, 301.

1293
01:44:15,251 --> 01:44:16,920
-Come on, Mama.
-Let's go.

1294
01:44:23,426 --> 01:44:25,512
And I saw myself breathing.

1295
01:44:25,678 --> 01:44:27,555
Like, my body was going up and down.

1296
01:44:27,722 --> 01:44:30,558
I thought,
"Why didn't somebody tell me?"

1297
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:36,856
Your hair needs washing.
It's kind of greasy.

1298
01:44:50,995 --> 01:44:52,330
It's just a....

1299
01:44:53,331 --> 01:44:55,416
It's just some kind of legal thing.

1300
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:56,960
What is it?

1301
01:44:57,127 --> 01:44:59,212
How we all doing here?

1302
01:44:59,337 --> 01:45:01,881
Sorry, darling,
but we ain't got a lot of time.

1303
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:06,261
Mr. Johnson's charging us a lot of money
to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1304
01:45:06,427 --> 01:45:09,055
Why don't you just leave that.
I'll read it to her later.

1305
01:45:09,222 --> 01:45:10,723
Hey, old man...

1306
01:45:10,974 --> 01:45:12,433
...you part of our family?

1307
01:45:13,351 --> 01:45:15,019
Stay the hell out of this.

1308
01:45:16,604 --> 01:45:18,356
Read it to me, Mama.

1309
01:45:18,523 --> 01:45:22,068
Well, it's just something legal
to protect your money.

1310
01:45:22,819 --> 01:45:24,404
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1311
01:45:25,238 --> 01:45:28,658
The boxing commission's
paying for all this, everything.

1312
01:45:28,992 --> 01:45:31,119
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1313
01:45:31,327 --> 01:45:34,122
Mr. Johnson says
they can take my house.

1314
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:37,500
If you assign your assets to your mother,
no one can touch them.

1315
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:39,502
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1316
01:45:40,295 --> 01:45:43,256
-Nothing.
-Yeah, look, why don't you just leave it.

1317
01:45:43,506 --> 01:45:47,302
-Then I'll just read it to her later on--
-With respect, this ain't your business.

1318
01:45:48,845 --> 01:45:51,264
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1319
01:45:57,479 --> 01:45:59,856
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1320
01:46:01,483 --> 01:46:03,234
You sign that paper...

1321
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:05,695
...it'll take care of your family...

1322
01:46:06,029 --> 01:46:08,281
...the way your daddy
would've wanted you to.

1323
01:46:13,036 --> 01:46:14,996
How do you make your mark?

1324
01:46:17,582 --> 01:46:18,792
Can you hold a pen?

1325
01:46:18,917 --> 01:46:21,336
She gotta do it with her teeth, Mama.

1326
01:46:21,503 --> 01:46:23,546
You gotta put it in her mouth.

1327
01:46:24,964 --> 01:46:26,674
Here you go, honey.

1328
01:46:29,803 --> 01:46:31,846
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1329
01:46:32,138 --> 01:46:34,265
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1330
01:46:35,809 --> 01:46:37,393
I did pretty good.

1331
01:46:37,602 --> 01:46:39,437
You lost, Mary M.

1332
01:46:40,355 --> 01:46:44,108
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it,
but you lost.

1333
01:46:45,735 --> 01:46:48,446
Don't wanna lose the rest
of what you got left.

1334
01:46:48,905 --> 01:46:50,490
There you go.

1335
01:46:59,749 --> 01:47:01,709
What happened to you?

1336
01:47:02,043 --> 01:47:03,711
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1337
01:47:05,588 --> 01:47:08,967
Mama, you take Mardell and J.D.
and get home.

1338
01:47:10,844 --> 01:47:14,139
Before I tell that lawyer that you were
so worried about your welfare...

1339
01:47:14,347 --> 01:47:17,559
...you never signed those house papers
like you were supposed to.

1340
01:47:20,395 --> 01:47:22,814
So any time I feel like it,
I can sell that house...

1341
01:47:22,981 --> 01:47:26,192
...from under your fat, lazy,
hillbilly asses.

1342
01:47:28,278 --> 01:47:31,531
And if you ever come back,
that's exactly what I'll do.

1343
01:48:12,906 --> 01:48:17,035
Well, maybe someone ought
to count to 10.

1344
01:48:30,548 --> 01:48:32,675
Don't smell real pretty, does it, doc?

1345
01:48:35,637 --> 01:48:37,263
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1346
01:49:54,215 --> 01:49:57,093
They took my leg, boss.

1347
01:50:01,973 --> 01:50:04,392
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1348
01:50:05,268 --> 01:50:08,646
I always hear your voice, boss.

1349
01:50:40,428 --> 01:50:41,971
You need anything?

1350
01:50:45,767 --> 01:50:48,353
<i>I need to know what "mo cuishle" means.</i>

1351
01:50:50,146 --> 01:50:51,940
But you didn't win.

1352
01:50:52,482 --> 01:50:54,400
I don't have to tell you.

1353
01:50:58,154 --> 01:51:00,740
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1354
01:51:00,907 --> 01:51:03,201
No wonder no one loves you.

1355
01:51:06,746 --> 01:51:09,165
You remind me of my daddy.

1356
01:51:11,835 --> 01:51:13,795
Well, he must have been...

1357
01:51:14,337 --> 01:51:17,632
...a very intelligent, handsome man.

1358
01:51:21,469 --> 01:51:24,639
You ain't gonna make me talk
no more Yeats, are you?

1359
01:51:26,558 --> 01:51:27,976
No, I was...

1360
01:51:29,477 --> 01:51:32,397
...Iooking at this catalog
from City College.

1361
01:51:34,691 --> 01:51:37,026
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair...

1362
01:51:37,485 --> 01:51:40,905
...maybe the kind that operates
by blowing through a straw.

1363
01:51:41,698 --> 01:51:44,659
I thought maybe you'd like
to go back to school.

1364
01:51:49,747 --> 01:51:52,167
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1365
01:51:54,377 --> 01:51:56,129
Sure.

1366
01:51:57,505 --> 01:51:59,466
Anything you want.

1367
01:52:01,217 --> 01:52:04,179
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1368
01:52:16,983 --> 01:52:19,527
Don't even think about that.

1369
01:52:23,406 --> 01:52:25,825
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1370
01:52:29,037 --> 01:52:30,830
Not after what I done.

1371
01:52:30,997 --> 01:52:32,999
I seen the world.

1372
01:52:36,044 --> 01:52:38,254
People chanted my name.

1373
01:52:39,255 --> 01:52:40,423
Well...

1374
01:52:42,383 --> 01:52:45,845
...not my name,
some damn name you gave me.

1375
01:52:48,848 --> 01:52:51,351
But they were chanting for me.

1376
01:52:54,854 --> 01:52:57,232
I was in magazines.

1377
01:53:00,985 --> 01:53:03,780
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1378
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:11,871
I was born at 2 pounds,
1 and a half ounces.

1379
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:18,878
Daddy used to tell me
I fought to get into this world...

1380
01:53:22,257 --> 01:53:24,551
...and I'd fight my way out.

1381
01:53:29,514 --> 01:53:32,475
That's all I wanna do, Frankie.

1382
01:53:34,602 --> 01:53:37,105
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1383
01:53:40,066 --> 01:53:41,442
I got what I needed.

1384
01:53:45,446 --> 01:53:47,866
I got it all.

1385
01:53:51,453 --> 01:53:54,497
Don't let them keep
taking it away from me.

1386
01:53:59,586 --> 01:54:04,549
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear
those people chanting no more.

1387
01:54:09,512 --> 01:54:11,806
I can't.

1388
01:54:12,474 --> 01:54:14,601
Please.

1389
01:54:16,644 --> 01:54:19,105
Please, don't ask me.

1390
01:54:21,232 --> 01:54:23,318
I'm asking.

1391
01:54:26,905 --> 01:54:28,781
I can't.

1392
01:55:12,659 --> 01:55:14,619
Hello?

1393
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:22,127
<i>In the middle of the night...</i>

1394
01:55:22,293 --> 01:55:25,296
<i>...Maggie had found her own solution.</i>

1395
01:55:25,839 --> 01:55:28,007
<i>She had bit her tongue.</i>

1396
01:55:35,098 --> 01:55:37,976
Stop. Stop.

1397
01:55:41,437 --> 01:55:44,065
Look at me. Look at me.

1398
01:55:58,371 --> 01:56:02,167
<i>Nearly bled to death
before they stitched her up.</i>

1399
01:56:02,584 --> 01:56:06,963
<i>She came around and ripped them out
before Frankie even got there.</i>

1400
01:56:07,255 --> 01:56:09,424
<i>They stitched her up again...</i>

1401
01:56:09,591 --> 01:56:12,760
<i>...padded the tongue
so she couldn't bite.</i>

1402
01:56:31,070 --> 01:56:33,448
You can't do it, you know that.

1403
01:56:35,241 --> 01:56:37,243
I do, Father.

1404
01:56:38,203 --> 01:56:40,205
But you don't know how thick she is...

1405
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:42,916
...how hard it was to train her.

1406
01:56:43,291 --> 01:56:47,212
Other fighters would do
exactly what you'd say to them...

1407
01:56:47,337 --> 01:56:52,842
...and she'd ask, why this and why that,
and then do it her own way anyway.

1408
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:55,804
How she fought for the title, I....

1409
01:56:55,970 --> 01:56:57,472
It wasn't by anything....

1410
01:56:57,639 --> 01:57:00,642
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1411
01:57:09,734 --> 01:57:11,986
But now she wants to die...

1412
01:57:12,195 --> 01:57:14,447
...and I just wanna keep her with me.

1413
01:57:18,785 --> 01:57:22,997
And I swear to God, Father, it's....

1414
01:57:23,498 --> 01:57:26,292
It's committing a sin by doing it.

1415
01:57:26,501 --> 01:57:29,921
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1416
01:57:30,296 --> 01:57:33,299
Do you know what I mean?
How do I get around that?

1417
01:57:34,676 --> 01:57:37,470
You don't. You step aside, Frankie.

1418
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:39,597
You leave her with God.

1419
01:57:40,306 --> 01:57:43,852
She's not asking for God's help.
She's asking for mine.

1420
01:57:44,018 --> 01:57:47,981
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass
almost every day for 23 years.

1421
01:57:48,189 --> 01:57:50,191
The only person comes
to church that much...

1422
01:57:50,358 --> 01:57:52,026
...is the kind who can't
forgive himself for something.

1423
01:57:52,193 --> 01:57:54,571
Whatever sins you're carrying...

1424
01:57:55,071 --> 01:57:57,532
...they're nothing compared to this.

1425
01:57:57,866 --> 01:58:02,036
Forget about God or heaven and hell.

1426
01:58:02,245 --> 01:58:05,331
If you do this thing, you'll be lost.

1427
01:58:08,793 --> 01:58:11,004
Somewhere so deep...

1428
01:58:12,881 --> 01:58:15,258
...you'll never find yourself again.

1429
01:58:21,431 --> 01:58:23,892
I think I did it already.

1430
01:58:45,747 --> 01:58:49,125
We're keeping her sedated
so she won't try that again.

1431
01:59:54,274 --> 01:59:56,985
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1432
01:59:58,736 --> 02:00:00,738
You must have been somewhere else.

1433
02:00:01,906 --> 02:00:03,783
Yeah.

1434
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:09,706
You got a fight I don't know about?

1435
02:00:15,128 --> 02:00:17,380
It wasn't your fault.

1436
02:00:17,839 --> 02:00:19,966
I was wrong to say that.

1437
02:00:20,216 --> 02:00:22,177
You're damn right.

1438
02:00:23,553 --> 02:00:24,846
I found you a fighter...

1439
02:00:25,054 --> 02:00:28,600
...and you made her
the best fighter she could be.

1440
02:00:31,186 --> 02:00:32,645
I killed her.

1441
02:00:32,812 --> 02:00:34,689
Don't say that.

1442
02:00:35,023 --> 02:00:37,609
Maggie walked through that door
with nothing but guts.

1443
02:00:37,775 --> 02:00:40,987
No chance in the world of being
what she needed to be.

1444
02:00:41,112 --> 02:00:44,532
A year and a half later, she's fighting
for the championship of the world.

1445
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:45,950
You did that.

1446
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:50,705
People die every day, Frankie.

1447
02:00:50,872 --> 02:00:52,749
Mopping floors, washing dishes.

1448
02:00:53,082 --> 02:00:55,043
And you know what
their last thought is?

1449
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:57,670
"I never got my shot."

1450
02:00:58,171 --> 02:01:00,423
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1451
02:01:01,716 --> 02:01:05,386
If she dies today, you know what
her last thought will be?

1452
02:01:06,262 --> 02:01:08,598
"I think I did all right."

1453
02:01:16,231 --> 02:01:18,775
I know I could rest with that.

1454
02:01:21,486 --> 02:01:22,529
Yeah.

1455
02:01:23,112 --> 02:01:24,906
Yeah.

1456
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,710
Yeah.

1457
02:02:15,915 --> 02:02:17,375
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1458
02:02:17,542 --> 02:02:19,002
Yeah.

1459
02:02:45,987 --> 02:02:47,572
All right.

1460
02:02:51,743 --> 02:02:54,245
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine...

1461
02:02:55,121 --> 02:02:57,373
...then you're gonna go to sleep.

1462
02:03:02,086 --> 02:03:04,839
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'II...

1463
02:03:05,882 --> 02:03:07,509
...stay asleep.

1464
02:03:12,847 --> 02:03:14,641
<i>Mo cuishle...</i>

1465
02:03:16,142 --> 02:03:19,771
...means "my darling, my blood."

1466
02:04:27,881 --> 02:04:30,633
<i>He gave her a single shot.</i>

1467
02:04:31,050 --> 02:04:35,263
<i>It was enough adrenaline
to do the job a few times over.</i>

1468
02:04:35,597 --> 02:04:38,475
<i>He didn't want her
going through this again.</i>

1469
02:05:28,316 --> 02:05:30,026
<i>Then he walked out.</i>

1470
02:05:30,652 --> 02:05:33,905
<i>I don't think he had anything left.</i>

1471
02:05:52,507 --> 02:05:54,717
<i>I went back to the gym.</i>

1472
02:05:55,009 --> 02:05:58,680
<i>Waited, figuring he'd turn up
sooner or later.</i>

1473
02:06:18,324 --> 02:06:21,744
<i>And that's when a ghost
came through the door.</i>

1474
02:06:24,289 --> 02:06:27,333
I got to thinking what you said,
Mr. Scrap.

1475
02:06:28,418 --> 02:06:30,044
What was that, Danger?

1476
02:06:31,713 --> 02:06:34,299
Anybody can lose one fight.

1477
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:37,385
That's the truth.

1478
02:06:38,178 --> 02:06:40,763
Go on, put your gloves on.
You missed a lot of training.

1479
02:06:42,724 --> 02:06:45,226
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1480
02:07:04,037 --> 02:07:07,165
<i>Frankie never came back at all.</i>

1481
02:07:21,930 --> 02:07:26,059
<i>Frankie didn't leave a note,
and nobody knew where he went.</i>

1482
02:07:26,434 --> 02:07:28,978
<i>I'd hoped he'd gone to find you...</i>

1483
02:07:29,103 --> 02:07:32,148
<i>...and ask you one more time
to forgive him.</i>

1484
02:07:32,273 --> 02:07:35,777
<i>But maybe he didn't have
anything left in his heart.</i>

1485
02:07:35,944 --> 02:07:39,280
<i>I just hope he found someplace
where he could find a little peace.</i>

1486
02:07:39,781 --> 02:07:42,867
<i>A place set in the cedars and oak trees.</i>

1487
02:07:43,243 --> 02:07:46,412
<i>Somewhere between
nowhere and goodbye.</i>

1488
02:07:46,579 --> 02:07:50,166
<i>But that's probably wishful thinking.</i>

1489
02:07:50,625 --> 02:07:52,627
<i>No matter where he is...</i>

1490
02:07:53,211 --> 02:07:57,966
<i>...I thought you should know what kind
of man your father really was.</i>
