2
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,739
You'll float, too!

3
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:31,205
You'll float, too!

4
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,324
You'll float, too!

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,869
I saw all of us.

6
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,838
All of us were there.

7
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:48,707
Back in the cistern.

8
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,494
But we were older.

9
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,329
We were our parents' ages.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,883
Am I still handsome
as an adult?

11
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:59,902
You grow into your looks.

12
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:01,820
What the fuck does that mean?

13
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:05,490
What about me?

14
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,611
Like now,

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,795
but taller.

16
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,537
Swear it.

17
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:24,176
Swear if It isn't dead,

18
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:27,228
if It ever comes back,

19
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,513
we'll come back, too.

20
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:34,520
Memory,

21
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,289
it's a funny thing.

22
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,444
People want to
believe they are

23
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,228
what they choose
to remember.

24
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,231
The good stuff.

25
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:49,769
The moments.

26
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:53,504
The places.

27
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,310
The people
we all hold on to.

28
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,381
But sometimes

29
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,350
sometimes

30
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,924
we are what we wish
we could forget.

31
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,865
Okay, kids.

32
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:37,866
Get ready.

33
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:38,967
Go!

34
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,402
Who's it gonna be?

35
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,219
First one to pop
their balloon's a winner!

36
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,806
It could be anyone!
We got a real

37
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,176
barn burner here, folks.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,578
It's getting close.

39
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,246
Who's gonna catch the
leader, huh?

40
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:53,849
Who's gonna be
the big winner tonight?

41
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,134
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!

42
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:57,887
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

43
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,320
Thank you.
Wow.

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,956
You really showed 'em, huh?

45
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,407
I did. I

46
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:04,143
Yeah.

47
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:08,631
Hey, girl, do you want this?

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,049
Thanks
for letting me win.

49
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:12,282
Yeah.

50
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,468
What'd you get, Vicky?

51
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:15,705
Aww.
Such a gentleman.

52
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,873
Look at that!

53
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:21,076
Well, here is
your consolation prize.

54
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:22,510
Look at that.

55
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,813
Never been a fan
of the beaver,

56
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,331
but look at this hat.
I mean

57
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,034
Thank you.

58
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,823
So, we need
to talk logistics.

59
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,825
Ooh. How romantic.

60
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,509
Romantic?

61
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:41,445
What's so
fucking romantic, huh?

62
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:44,216
Hey.

63
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,125
Your mommas ever teach you
boys to respond to someone

64
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:49,741
when they ask you
a fucking question?

65
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:51,623
Come on, Adrian.

66
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:54,794
You got a problem, faggot?

67
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:00,015
I don't,
but Meg Ryan called.

68
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,317
She wants her wig back.

69
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,450
All right. All right.

70
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,437
Come on.
Come on, Adrian.

71
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,593
Stuff like that is

72
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,290
why I have to leave
this shithole town.

73
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,390
Small minds.

74
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,490
They have small dicks.

75
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,866
I'm being serious.

76
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,099
We belong elsewhere.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,902
Hey, look,
if you end up hating New York,

78
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,304
we can always
move back here.

79
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:23,873
I just want
to be with you.

80
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,941
I don't care.
New York, Derry, whatever. It's

81
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,474
You have to say that.

82
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:28,772
I don't have
to say anything.

83
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,780
Take off that fucking hat.

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,715
Oh, God.
Come on, let's go.

85
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,573
Wouldn't want to
give people the impression

86
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:37,028
we allow a bunch of fucking
fairies like you in this town.

87
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,446
Yeah, he was
born here, asshole.

88
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:40,690
All right, let's go.
No. You know what?

89
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,027
I'll take off the hat
for you.

90
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,659
But why leave it there?

91
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,126
Anything else
you would like me

92
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,863
to take off
for you tonight?

93
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:50,049
Any special requests, ladies?

94
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,400
Fucker!

95
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,700
Let him go!

96
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,412
What's that?
Stop.

97
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,347
I don't think
you'll be needing that.

98
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:08,383
Leave him alone!
Hit him.

99
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:11,137
He's got asthma, fucker!

100
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,243
Come on!

101
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:20,662
Fuck him up!

102
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,797
Come on,
kick him!

103
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:24,296
Come on,
kick the shit out of him.

104
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:25,566
Adrian!

105
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,491
I still hate
your fucking hair.

106
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,328
Adrian!

107
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,065
Get the fuck off him!

108
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,034
Look what you did
to his fucking face!

109
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,520
Hey! Hey!
Help me get him up.

110
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,022
Adrian.

111
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:49,842
Help me get this fucking
punk up right now.

112
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:57,967
Give me the hat, Chris.

113
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,066
It's fucking mine!

114
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,787
I said give me
the fucking hat!

115
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:04,089
Adrian!

116
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:06,775
You like that?

117
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,895
Welcome to Derry,
motherfucker.

118
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:12,280
No! Adrian!

119
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,381
No!

120
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,820
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

121
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,638
Let's go!
No!

122
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,044
Adrian!

123
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,181
Help!

124
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:32,181
Help me!

125
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,686
Somebody!

126
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:40,258
Somebody fucking help me!

127
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:55,306
Oh

128
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,311
Adrian.

129
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,054
No!

130
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,330
Adrian!

131
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,573
We all
float down here!

132
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,578
Thing is,

133
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,883
sometimes what we wish
was forgotten,

134
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,887
what we tried to
leave in the past,

135
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,690
won't stay there.

136
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,244
Units, please respond.

137
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,301
I'm getting reports of a
body found dismembered.

138
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,647
Come back.
Was that "dismembered"?

139
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:54,015
That's affirmative.

140
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,433
Scene is near
the south entrance

141
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:56,652
of the festival grounds.

142
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,186
Copy that. En route.

143
00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,488
Any directive for TC?

144
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:01,289
That's affirmative.

145
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,306
Chief said to tape off
the Derry Street Bridge.

146
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,044
Sometimes,
it comes back for you.

147
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:22,753
Ah.

148
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:27,093
Mr. Denbrough?
They need you on set.

149
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,917
We're just going to
go this way.

150
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:36,819
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
No, don't!

151
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:38,420
Hey!
Clear the door!

152
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,357
Oh, come on.
You've never seen Indiana Jones?

153
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:41,690
Watch your back.

154
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,258
Hey, hey.
You a crewmember?

155
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,944
I'm the writer.

156
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,037
Your husband's here.

157
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,173
Hey!
Do you have the pages?

158
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,743
Everyone,
keep clear of the crane.

159
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:04,513
My friend,
a film needs an ending.

160
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,282
You do know that, right?
Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:08,349
You said that
you needed another day

162
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,785
to finish the pages,

163
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,682
and we're shooting this thing.
It's tonight.

164
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:12,782
That's, like, 17 hours

165
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:13,960
Everybody, calm down, okay?

166
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm calm.

167
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,715
I want you to be
happy with the movie.

168
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,173
You understand?
I'm on your side.

169
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,152
That's great.
'Cause in my book, the ending

170
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,430
Is terrible.

171
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,266
All due respect,
people loved your book. Loved.

172
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,801
They hated the ending.

173
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,570
You said
you liked the ending.

174
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,070
That was a lie.

175
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,272
We gotta do better, okay?
Yeah.

176
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:34,276
Audra, you have my notes.
Would you

177
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,245
Okay, thank you very much.
Take me back to one, please.

178
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,345
Bye.

179
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,617
You have his notes?

180
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:42,619
He's not wrong.

181
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,353
You hate my endings, too?

182
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:45,820
Not all your endings.

183
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:46,955
But this

184
00:10:47,056 --> 00:10:49,023
Okay.
Just

185
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,359
What? Do you want me
to keep lying to you

186
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,530
just because I'm your wife?
You're my wife?

187
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,096
No. No.
But you know what?

188
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,314
You've been blowing smoke
up my ass for eight years?

189
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,051
I guess I thought
you were someone else.

190
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:01,237
I have not been
blowing smoke up your ass.

191
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,439
Everybody wants
a happy ending.

192
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,840
Everybody wants closure.

193
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,508
But that's not
the way life works out.

194
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:08,911
I think what Peter wants
and what the studio wants

195
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,412
The studio?
When'd you become a company man?

196
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:12,947
Jesus, you're an artist.

197
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,685
Come on.
What's wrong with just doing it

198
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:16,383
the way it's written?
The way I wanted.

199
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,560
What's wrong with being
the woman I want you to be?

200
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,721
Fuck you, Bill.

201
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,874
On the page.
The part, I mean. Not you.

202
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,248
Hello?

203
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:34,103
Bill Denbrough?
It's Mike.

204
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:35,203
Mike who?

205
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,072
Mike Hanlon.

206
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,059
From Derry.

207
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:48,968
You need to come home.

208
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:56,425
Eddie,
I keep telling you

209
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:57,960
not to scare me
like this.

210
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,261
And you never
listen to me.

211
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,780
All right. Myra, please.
Not now.

212
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,065
You shouldn't be out there.

213
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:04,363
Eddie, it's not safe
to drive

214
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:05,901
when the roads
are slick like this.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,518
Sweetheart,
it stopped raining, like,

216
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:08,737
three hours ago.
All right?

217
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:10,339
Everything is gonna be fine.

218
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,555
Hey, dickhead!
Flow of traffic mean anything to you?

219
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:13,654
What if you hydroplane?

220
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:14,753
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

221
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,445
It is my job
to assess risk.

222
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:18,180
So, please trust me
when I tell you

223
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,548
that, statistically speaking,

224
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,487
I am much more likely to
get into an accident

225
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,484
because I am talking
to you on the phone!

226
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:24,920
All right?
I have to go.

227
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,706
I will talk to you soon.
Goodbye.

228
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,292
Edward Kaspbrak speaking.

229
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:32,028
You didn't say,
"Okay, bye, I love you,"

230
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,128
like you usually do.

231
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:34,228
Listen to me. I can't!

232
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:35,607
I'm going to be
late to this

233
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:37,682
meeting.

234
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:38,966
Say "I love you," Eddie.

235
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,802
Okay, I love you, Mommy.

236
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:41,902
What?

237
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,623
Myra. Bye.

238
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:47,375
Hello? Who's this?

239
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,744
It's me. Mike.

240
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,028
Mike who?

241
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,248
Eddie! You okay?

242
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,134
Yeah,
I'm pretty good.

243
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,526
Dude! Dude,
what the fuck?

244
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,293
You were fine, like,
five seconds ago.

245
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:07,596
Who was it? Who called? Huh?

246
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:09,998
Rich? Rich?
Talk to me.

247
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,768
You're on in two minutes.
You good?

248
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,551
'Cause you look not good.

249
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,074
I'm fine.
You're fine? Okay.

250
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:18,532
And we're walking.
We're walking.

251
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,676
Sixty seconds.

252
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:20,975
Even faster. All right.

253
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:22,714
Can we get him
a bottle of water, maybe?

254
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,278
Bourbon.
Bourbon. Sure, sure.

255
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:25,815
And a mint.

256
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,416
It is showtime.

257
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,551
I don't think I can do this.
It's what you do.

258
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,489
You kill. You're a killer.
That was fast.

259
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,868
Okay. We are
good to go, and

260
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:34,445
Hey! Where we going?
Where we going?

261
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:35,591
No. This way. Attaboy.

262
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,691
Okay.

263
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:39,729
All right.
How do I look?

264
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,564
Your hands are shaking, Rich.

265
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:42,663
Shit.

266
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,432
Ladies and gentlemen,

267
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,119
please welcome Richie Tozier!

268
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,662
All right.
How are we doing tonight?

269
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,716
So, my girlfriend
caught me masturbating

270
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:02,668
to her friend's Facebook page.

271
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:07,105
And so now
I'm in Masturbators Anonymous.

272
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,992
And I stand up
at the first meeting

273
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,829
and I say, "My name
is Richie Trashmouth."

274
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,797
Trashmouth.
Shut up, Richie.

275
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,865
Fucking perv.
Shut up, Richie.

276
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:18,032
Pussy!

277
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,018
Trashmouth. Uh

278
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,056
Forgot the joke.

279
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:26,191
You suck!

280
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,614
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

281
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:33,315
for letting us
present to you today.

282
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:36,918
Now, this will include
over a million square feet

283
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:40,055
of commercial
and residential space.

284
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:41,691
State-of-the-art
office towers.

285
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,125
What I'm really looking for
is to understand

286
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:47,094
how we create even more
retail opportunities.

287
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:50,431
If we put in walls here
and all along here

288
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,117
Lose them.

289
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,504
With all due respect,
Mr. Hanscom

290
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,875
Ben, please.
And with all due respect to you,

291
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:01,243
I'm getting claustrophobic

292
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,779
just looking at this model.
Aren't you?

293
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,349
Look. Throw up more walls,
it's gonna feel like a prison.

294
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,167
You know what people
want to do in prison?

295
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,787
Get out. Right?

296
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:13,772
This should be a place
that brings people together.

297
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,709
A meeting ground.

298
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,017
A clubhouse.

299
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,351
And if,

300
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,320
while people are there

301
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,761
Excuse me
for one second.

302
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,585
Hello?
Ben?

303
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:45,503
It's Mike Hanlon.
From Derry.

304
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,139
Should I just book it?

305
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,875
You're sure you can
get away from work?

306
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,460
It's summer, why not?

307
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,998
Okay, we are
Buenos Aires-bound.

308
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,681
Stanley Uris speaking.

309
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,733
It's Mike.

310
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:31,901
I'm sorry?

311
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,451
Mike Hanlon.

312
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:35,588
From Derry.

313
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:38,791
Mike.

314
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,744
God, sorry. Yes, hi.

315
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:44,128
I don't
know why I didn't

316
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:48,817
How long's it been?

317
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,436
A long time.

318
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,504
27 years.

319
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:02,031
It's come back,
hasn't it?

320
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,329
That's why
you're calling me?

321
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,499
It's starting again, Stan.

322
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,436
Bad things are happening.

323
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:08,638
Did you call the others?

324
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,974
I mean,
what if they don't come?

325
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,943
We made a promise,
remember?

326
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:15,561
How soon
can you get here?

327
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,128
Um

328
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:18,747
Well, I

329
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,016
Yeah, I would need to
do a few things

330
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:22,735
Tomorrow.

331
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,303
We don't have much time.

332
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:28,705
I'll text you
everything you need.

333
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:31,176
I'll see you soon,
Stan the Man.

334
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,145
Do you swear?

335
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,259
I swear, Bill.

336
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:09,058
You made
a promise, Beverly.

337
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:10,926
I'm so sorry, Mike.

338
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,561
I don't even really remember.

339
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,459
Haven't you ever wondered
why you can't seem

340
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,565
to remember the things
most people should

341
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,336
about where they're from,
about who they are,

342
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,355
why you have that scar
on your hand?

343
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,376
No one else remembered,
either.

344
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:31,848
Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie

345
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:32,947
Bill.

346
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,081
Bill.

347
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,269
You have to come back.

348
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:39,906
You all do.

349
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
When?

350
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:00,192
Whoa.

351
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:02,145
Are you okay?
What's going on?

352
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:06,348
It's the middle of the night.
You're packing?

353
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:07,849
I didn't want to wake
you, honey.

354
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:10,284
I know this week's
been really exhausting.

355
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:14,473
I just got a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

356
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,860
I have to go back there.

357
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:20,830
It's really hard
to explain why.

358
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:21,929
It's okay.

359
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,584
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

360
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,704
I trust you.

361
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:29,988
Thank you.

362
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:37,329
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

363
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,002
I heard you.

364
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:46,789
You said the name Mike.

365
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:47,888
Yes, my friend.

366
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:49,724
See, there was
a group of us back then,

367
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:52,180
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

368
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,897
You know trust is everything
in a relationship.

369
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:58,300
You know
it's everything to me, right?

370
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,334
I know. This isn't
Right?

371
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,337
What?
Like the last time?

372
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:04,173
I never cheated on you.

373
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:05,640
You're a bad fucking liar,

374
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:06,741
Bev.

375
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,444
You're not going anywhere,
okay?

376
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:12,147
I want you to stay right here,

377
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:13,582
and you're gonna show me

378
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:15,984
what it is you're gonna
do with Mike. Okay?

379
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,587
You're hurting me, honey.

380
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,722
No one else is
gonna love you like me.

381
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,040
You know that, right?

382
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,109
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,859
Don't make this
fucking harder!

384
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:32,985
Don't.

385
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:01,930
You're nothing without me!
You know that, right?

386
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:03,649
Tell me I'm wrong!

387
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:19,942
Jesus Christ.

388
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,042
Boys.

389
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:24,112
Little prick's got balls,
I'll give him that.

390
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,246
Far enough, Bowers!

391
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:26,548
I'm not done yet.

392
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,086
I'm not done.
I'm not fucking done.

393
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:29,464
On your knees.
I can't. No!

394
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,552
I gotta kill them all!
Fuck, fuck!

395
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:33,188
Fucking kill them all!
Stop it!

396
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:36,391
Cuff this sorry sack of shit!
Fuck you!

397
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:37,859
Fuck you!

398
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,794
Henry Bowers,
I am placing you under arrest

399
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,597
for the murder
of Oscar Bowers.

400
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,849
Do you understand, dipshit?

401
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:46,702
You have the right
to an attorney.

402
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,888
You have the right
to remain silent.

403
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,632
Bowers!

404
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:38,603
Bowers, calm the fuck down!

405
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:50,049
Someone needs a little extra
clozapine today, don't they?

406
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,351
Stay in your fucking room.

407
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:55,247
Hockstetter.

408
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:00,887
My knife.

409
00:26:15,636 --> 00:26:17,686
Whoa.
Careful.

410
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,288
This way.

411
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:20,939
Thanks a lot.

412
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,161
Hey.
Oh

413
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:27,563
Mike, you look good.
Bill.

414
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:30,081
Yup. Whoa.
Hey. How you doing?

415
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,650
Bill.

416
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:34,429
I didn't know
if any of you would

417
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,767
I mean,
after all this time

418
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,225
Yeah.
But of course you came.

419
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:38,674
You know,
an oath is an oath.

420
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:39,974
Losers

421
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:43,411
gotta stick together, right?

422
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:44,613
The Losers.

423
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:47,032
You remember that.
That's good.

424
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:49,717
What else do you remember?

425
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,086
I am allergic to soy,

426
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:53,155
anything that has egg in
it, uh, gluten,

427
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:57,176
and if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

428
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:00,146
Holy shit.

429
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:17,263
Is there a password
or something?

430
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:21,032
I'm sorry.

431
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,502
The new kid.

432
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,570
Ben?

433
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:27,504
Yeah.

434
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:30,792
Oh, my God.

435
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:32,994
Oh, my God.

436
00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:35,281
It's been so long.

437
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:40,202
Stay cool,
Ben from soc class.

438
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,070
You too, Beverly.

439
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,531
Hang tough,
new kid on the block.

440
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,590
Wow.

441
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,512
You two look amazing.

442
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:51,763
What the fuck
happened to me?

443
00:27:52,999 --> 00:27:54,436
What's going on, man?
Hey, man.

444
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:56,334
It's Richie. Hi.
Yeah. It's Ben.

445
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,472
Hi.
Hey.

446
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,259
This meeting
of the Losers' Club

447
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,426
has officially begun.

448
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:05,845
Look at these guys.

449
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:09,947
Ben.

450
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,240
So, wait, Eddie,
you got married?

451
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,097
Yeah, why's that so fucking
funny, dickwad?

452
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:21,196
What?
To, like, a woman?

453
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,145
Fuck you, bro.

454
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,613
Fuck you!

455
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:26,790
All right. What about you, Trashmouth?
You married?

456
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,207
There's no way
Richie's married.

457
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:29,308
No, I got married.

458
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,924
Richie, I don't believe it.
When?

459
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:32,262
Did you not hear this?
No.

460
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,599
You didn't know
I got married?

461
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:35,058
No.
Yeah, no. Me and your mom

462
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:36,436
are very, very happy
right now.

463
00:28:36,535 --> 00:28:37,959
Yeah, very happy.

464
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,500
He totally fell for it!
Thanks.

465
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:42,231
Fuck you.

466
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,687
She's very sweet.
Sometimes, she'll put her arm around me,

467
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:46,519
and she'll whisper to me,
she'll go

468
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:52,390
We all get it.
My mom was a great, big, fat person.

469
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:53,824
Shh.

470
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,994
Hilarious. Hysterical.

471
00:28:58,063 --> 00:28:59,683
Yeah,
it's a nice watch.

472
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:02,184
Wait, let's talk about the
elephant not in the room

473
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,283
Ben.

474
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:04,721
What the fuck, man?

475
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,656
Okay, okay.
Obviously, I lost a few pounds.

476
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:08,592
Lost a few pounds?
Yeah, no shit you lost

477
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:10,530
a few pounds.
You're, like You're hot!

478
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:11,629
That's true.

479
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:13,565
No, you're like
every Brazilian soccer player

480
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,184
wrapped up into one person.
Gorgeous.

481
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:16,961
Leave him alone.
You're embarrassing him.

482
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,657
Okay, okay, all right.
Please, come on.

483
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,935
Is Stanley coming
or what?

484
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:21,454
Someone save me.

485
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,555
Stan.

486
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,759
Stan

487
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,079
Stan Uris.
Stan Urine.

488
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:32,447
Stanley Urine.
No, no, he's a fucking pussy.

489
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:33,548
He's not gonna show.

490
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,417
Why would
Stanley save you, anyway?

491
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:37,086
Was I not the one
who basically

492
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,454
performed surgery on you

493
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:39,911
after Bowers cut you up?
Yes!

494
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:41,523
Holy shit!
That's right.

495
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:43,701
Please tell me you ended
up becoming a doctor, Eds.

496
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:46,494
No, I ended up becoming
a risk analyst.

497
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:48,032
Oh, that sounds
really interesting.

498
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:49,330
What does that entail?

499
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,217
Yeah, so I work for
a big insurance firm and

500
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:02,779
Fuck you, dude.
Fuck you.

501
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:05,313
Was this job
invented before fun?

502
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:08,082
That's so not funny.
It is funny.

503
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,653
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

504
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:12,538
I propose a toast

505
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:15,541
to the Losers.

506
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,349
Let's take our
shirts off and kiss!

507
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:24,948
Oh!

508
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:31,974
Oh, here we go.
Thank you.

509
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,609
Thank you.

510
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,812
Like, Rogan-Marsh,
half my wife's closet Rogan-Marsh?

511
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:39,013
That's
That's huge.

512
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:42,216
That's our line.
Me and my husband, Tom.

513
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:43,619
How long have
you been married?

514
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,186
Hey, we saw your movie,

515
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:46,522
by the way.
You did?

516
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:48,090
Oh, my God!
It was so good.

517
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:50,091
Oh, my God.
It was so scary.

518
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,476
And the ending sucked?

519
00:30:53,746 --> 00:30:55,496
Yeah, it did.
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:56,683
That's all right.

521
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:03,755
What?

522
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:05,474
Nothing.
This is just weird.

523
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,573
Yeah.

524
00:31:06,673 --> 00:31:08,276
Just all this,
all these memories,

525
00:31:08,377 --> 00:31:11,530
people that I don't even
remember forgetting.

526
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,917
I mean, it's weird, right?

527
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,753
Now that we're all here,

528
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:20,756
everything just comes back
faster and faster.

529
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,041
I mean, all of it.

530
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,108
Yeah.

531
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,721
Yeah, you know,
when Mike called me, I threw up.

532
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:28,964
Isn't that weird?
Like, I got nervous.

533
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,716
I got, like,
sick and I threw up.

534
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:33,735
I feel fine now.

535
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:35,713
I feel very relieved to be
here with you guys.

536
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,491
Why is everybody
looking at me like this?

537
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,174
When Mike called me,
I crashed my car.

538
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,309
Seriously?
Yeah.

539
00:31:40,408 --> 00:31:41,845
Shit, man,
I hear you.

540
00:31:41,945 --> 00:31:43,745
I mean, my heart
was literally

541
00:31:43,846 --> 00:31:46,415
pounding right
out of my chest.

542
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:48,667
I thought it was only me.
It was like pure

543
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:51,503
Fear.

544
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:56,324
It's fear.
What you felt.

545
00:31:56,425 --> 00:32:00,195
Why did we all
feel like that, Mike?

546
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:03,349
You remember something
we don't, don't you, Mike?

547
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:07,970
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

548
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,238
The farther away,
the hazier it all gets.

549
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,658
But me, I never left.

550
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:14,727
So, yeah.

551
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:17,597
I remember.

552
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:21,132
I remember all of it.

553
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:25,370
Pennywise.

554
00:32:27,372 --> 00:32:29,424
Oh, the fucking clown.

555
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:31,727
Oh, shit.
Pennywise.

556
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,863
Mike, you said you wanted
our help with something.

557
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:35,363
What was that?

558
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:36,999
There's an echo
here in Derry

559
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,701
that bounces back
every 27 years.

560
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:39,878
What are you talking about?

561
00:32:39,978 --> 00:32:41,369
Hold on.
Listen, listen.

562
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,237
We thought
we stopped It back then.

563
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,124
We thought It
was done, but

564
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:47,224
Mike.

565
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:49,477
A week ago, a man,

566
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:51,312
Adrian Mellon, slaughtered.

567
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,816
A girl, Lisa Albrecht,
the other night, went missing.

568
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,517
All right.

569
00:32:55,618 --> 00:32:57,774
There've already been others,
and there will be more.

570
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,391
I don't want to
hear about this shit.

571
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:01,009
More death. More pain.
Calm down.

572
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:02,109
Let's get another drink.

573
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:03,565
Let him explain.
Let him explain.

574
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,060
Explain it to us, Mike.

575
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,646
That echo,

576
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,666
we might have changed It,

577
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:10,966
just like It changed us.

578
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,901
But we didn't stop It.

579
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:15,087
Because It just bounced back.

580
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:19,641
We made an oath.

581
00:33:19,742 --> 00:33:22,811
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

582
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:24,680
To finish It.

583
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:26,264
For good.

584
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,185
Well, that shit got dark fast.

585
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,470
Thanks, Mike.

586
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,342
My fortune cookie
just says "Could."

587
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:40,795
They don't know how to do
fortune cookies here.

588
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:41,896
Mine just says "Guess."

589
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:45,017
You wanna throw
that over here?

590
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,120
What you got, Mikey?

591
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:55,677
Wait, what?

592
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:57,346
This is
what I'm talking about.

593
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,782
"Guess. Cut.
Not. Could. It."

594
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,316
It's a message.

595
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,251
No,
"Guess it could not cut."

596
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,588
Why would it guess
it could not cut?

597
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:06,723
Cut what?

598
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,189
"Guess
it could not cut."

599
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,925
"It" goes in front.
There.

600
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:11,359
"It could not guess."

601
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:13,796
It couldn't guess.
"Could it"

602
00:34:13,896 --> 00:34:15,129
No. "Could it not cut."

603
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:16,948
When it says "It,"
is it talking about It?

604
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:18,805
Yeah. All right.
Is that what it means?

605
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,343
Is "It" It?
Where does this go?

606
00:34:20,443 --> 00:34:21,682
That's what
I'm talking about.

607
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:22,782
It It could

608
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,318
I don't know
what it fucking means!

609
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:26,057
You fuck with
the fortune cookies, Mike?

610
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,515
No.
Whoa. Let him speak, man.

611
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,131
This is not me.
This is what It does.

612
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:30,812
I need my fucking inhaler!

613
00:34:30,912 --> 00:34:32,829
What is wrong with you, man?
Why'd you call us?

614
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,046
This is not fucking funny!
This is so not funny!

615
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:36,546
Beverly?
This is so not funny.

616
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:06,564
Why does it say Stanley?

617
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,003
Someone else
fucking answer me!

618
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,437
Holy shit.

619
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:14,974
Holy shit.

620
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:25,367
What the fuck
is that, man?

621
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,986
Oh, my God.

622
00:35:29,722 --> 00:35:30,724
Whoa, whoa!

623
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:35,492
Whoa!

624
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,834
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

625
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:43,970
Shit.

626
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,354
Hey! Hey!

627
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:49,943
That fortune cookie's
looking at me! Shit!

628
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,363
I don't want to be here.
I can't fucking do this.

629
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:57,483
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

630
00:35:58,184 --> 00:35:59,367
I don't wanna be here!

631
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:01,064
I wanna go home!
I don't wanna be here!

632
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:02,164
Holy shit!

633
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:04,555
Hey! God damn it.

634
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:10,696
Hey, Eddie!

635
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,330
Whoa! Fuck!

636
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,783
It's not real!

637
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:33,787
This isn't real!
It's not real!

638
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,838
It's not real!
It's not real!

639
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:39,407
It's not real!
It's not real!

640
00:36:39,506 --> 00:36:42,812
It's not real!
It's not real!

641
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:44,763
Is everything all right?

642
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,300
Yeah, yeah.
Could we get the check?

643
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:55,957
That's what
Pennywise does, right?

644
00:36:56,057 --> 00:36:57,934
He fucks with us.
So, Stanley's probably fine.

645
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,553
Hey, Mike.
Do you have Stan's number?

646
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:00,653
Yeah.

647
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,080
Hey, Richie.

648
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,901
How'd you

649
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:07,301
How'd you know my name?

650
00:37:07,401 --> 00:37:09,454
The fun's just beginning.

651
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:11,423
Right?

652
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:18,146
What he said, is it

653
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:19,782
Listen.
You think this is funny?

654
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:20,916
All right?

655
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:23,484
Think this is
some sort of game, huh?

656
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,754
Well, fuck you,
all right?

657
00:37:24,854 --> 00:37:26,122
Rich,
be careful, dude.

658
00:37:26,222 --> 00:37:27,941
Fuck you!
I'm not afraid of you!

659
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:30,725
"The fun's just beginning."

660
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:33,129
The line from your act, dude.
I'm a fan.

661
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,814
Are those your parents?
Yeah.

662
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:38,566
You want a picture?

663
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,736
You okay, Dean? Come on.
I think I'm good.

664
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:43,673
Okay, cool.
He's a good kid.

665
00:37:43,772 --> 00:37:45,439
Jesus, Richie.
You don't remember a line

666
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:46,809
from your own show?

667
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:48,977
I don't write
my own material.

668
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:51,780
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

669
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:56,184
Hello, Mrs. Uris.
My name's Beverly Marsh.

670
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:57,484
I apologize for calling,

671
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:59,354
but I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

672
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:01,022
You lied to us.
That's not okay.

673
00:38:01,122 --> 00:38:03,479
Yeah, first words out of your
mouth should have been like,

674
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,816
"Hey, man. You want to come
to Derry and get murdered?"

675
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,274
'Cause then
I would have said no.

676
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:08,374
Guys.

677
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:09,474
Fucking entrapment, man.

678
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:10,573
Oh

679
00:38:11,885 --> 00:38:13,720
He passed.

680
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:16,588
When did it happen?

681
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,256
Yesterday.

682
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:22,128
It was horrible,
the way he died.

683
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:24,713
His wrists.

684
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:27,066
In the bathtub.
In the bathtub.

685
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,888
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

686
00:38:32,988 --> 00:38:35,490
We're all very
sorry, Patty.

687
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,843
Thank you.

688
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:41,180
Stanley.

689
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:45,033
Pennywise knew.
He knew before we did.

690
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,836
We have to stop him.
I have a plan.

691
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:48,693
I got a plan.
Getting the fuck out of Dodge

692
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,907
before this ends worse
than one of Bill's books.

693
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:52,407
Who's with me?

694
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:53,825
We made a promise
to each other.

695
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:55,343
Let's un-make the promise.

696
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:56,881
Richie, other people
are gonna die.

697
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:58,914
Other people
die every day, man!

698
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:00,950
We don't owe
this town shit!

699
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,653
Plus, I just remembered I grew up
here, like, two hours ago.

700
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:06,488
So, I'm fucking leaving.
Fuck this.

701
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,890
I'm sorry, man,
I'm with Richie.

702
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,457
Eds, please.
Listen.

703
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,296
What? We stay,
we die, that's it?

704
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:15,765
I'm gonna go back to the inn,
I'm gonna pack up my shit,

705
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:17,332
and I'm gonna
drive to my home.

706
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:18,767
I'm sorry, man. Good luck.

707
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,602
No, Eddie. Please.
Please, Eddie!

708
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:22,220
Eddie, wait!

709
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,124
You okay?

710
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,017
I'm gonna head back
to the Town House, too.

711
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,495
Are you coming?
Yeah.

712
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:35,383
You should have told us,
Mikey.

713
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:37,620
Bill. Please, man.

714
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,854
I'm begging you.
Please.

715
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:40,388
Just listen to me, man.
Please.

716
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:42,075
What are you gonna say?

717
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,160
What could you possibly say

718
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,937
that would make
any kind of a difference?

719
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,564
They're all gone.

720
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:50,899
Come on.
Let me show you something.

721
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:54,501
One thing. And if you want to
leave, you can leave.

722
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,242
Just let me show you
this first. Please.

723
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,414
Lapskew!
What kind of name is that, huh?

724
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:06,816
My mom swings
better than you!

725
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,216
How many times
do I have to

726
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:11,037
She doesn't even play
baseball! You suck!

727
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:16,858
Mommy, how much longer?

728
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,762
Victoria,
we came to watch the game.

729
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,948
We're gonna
watch the game.

730
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:23,091
Hello, Vicky.

731
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,428
Isn't that what
your friends call you?

732
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:26,711
Vicky?

733
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:29,597
How did I know that?

734
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:33,234
I guess I must be
your friend, too.

735
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:36,254
If you're my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

736
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:41,126
You're not my friend.
You're scary.

737
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,004
Why are you crying?

738
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,809
People always make fun
'cause of the way I look.

739
00:41:59,412 --> 00:42:02,798
I thought if you
couldn't see my face,

740
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:06,285
then maybe you'd
want to be my friend.

741
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,238
Never mind.

742
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:14,876
Oh, silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

743
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:16,796
People make fun
of me, too.

744
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:19,664
They do?

745
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,767
'Cause of this.

746
00:42:24,504 --> 00:42:26,071
Well, isn't that silly?

747
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,325
That little thing?

748
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:32,077
Why, I can blow
that thing right away.

749
00:42:33,446 --> 00:42:34,497
You could?

750
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:35,897
Oh, yes!

751
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:38,917
One poof and it'd be gone!

752
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:45,358
You would have to get close
enough to see my face.

753
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:47,376
I don't know, Vicky.

754
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:50,196
No, it's okay.
I won't make fun. I promise.

755
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:53,231
Promise promise?

756
00:42:54,934 --> 00:42:56,651
Well, okie-dokie!

757
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,320
Just come on in
a little closer,

758
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:02,240
and we'll blow it away on
the count of three!

759
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:05,075
One,

760
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:09,814
two

761
00:43:21,928 --> 00:43:23,262
You're supposed to say three.

762
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:57,430
Holy fuck.

763
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,332
Boo!

764
00:44:13,446 --> 00:44:15,046
Fuck yeah!

765
00:44:17,515 --> 00:44:19,001
Hey, Hockstetter.

766
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,901
Let's go!

767
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:41,122
Let's get our shit and
get the fuck out of here.

768
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,591
Did you leave
your stuff here?

769
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,012
No, my stuff's
still in the car.

770
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:01,410
Tell me.
Tell you what?

771
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,262
Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

772
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:10,184
Bev. Bev.

773
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:12,762
Back at the Jade when you were
on the phone with Stanley's

774
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:13,861
Stop.

775
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:17,492
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

776
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:19,093
but, Bev, I saw you.

777
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:22,666
I heard it.
You said it first.

778
00:45:22,765 --> 00:45:24,244
Whatever you guys
are talking about,

779
00:45:24,343 --> 00:45:26,459
let's make it happen faster,
all right? We gotta go.

780
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,202
Eduardo, andale!
Let's go!

781
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:30,972
There's something
you're not telling us.

782
00:45:31,073 --> 00:45:33,258
You knew how Stanley died.
You knew.

783
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:35,595
Wait, what?

784
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:39,013
I can't do this.

785
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:40,671
She knew how Stanley
was going to die,

786
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,916
is that what
she just said?

787
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:44,119
You can't just
walk away from this.

788
00:45:44,218 --> 00:45:45,486
How did you know

789
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:46,586
where he killed himself?

790
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:47,686
Bev.

791
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:50,059
Talk to me.

792
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:51,994
Just talk to me.
Like we used to.

793
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:53,979
Come on,
how did you know?

794
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:56,082
Because I saw it.

795
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:00,051
I've seen all of us die.

796
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,198
Okay, I just got to
grab my toiletry bag,

797
00:46:03,298 --> 00:46:04,298
and then we can go.

798
00:46:06,124 --> 00:46:07,325
What'd I miss?

799
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:23,057
The library?

800
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:24,510
Mmm-hmm.

801
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,780
Wow.

802
00:46:28,363 --> 00:46:30,950
Didn't this place
used to be bigger?

803
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:45,363
Yo!
Mike, where are you going?

804
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:12,975
Mike, you live here?

805
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:15,059
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.

806
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:18,097
You want some water?
Yeah, sure.

807
00:47:31,845 --> 00:47:34,129
You see, memory's the thing.

808
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:35,731
It's the key.

809
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:37,298
It's the key
to everything.

810
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:41,135
If It really does want
us back here,

811
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:43,033
don't you think the
smartest thing we can do

812
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,530
is just get the hell
out of Derry?

813
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:46,508
No, no, no.
It does want us back.

814
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:47,676
Of course It does!

815
00:47:47,776 --> 00:47:49,374
But It doesn't know
I know what I know.

816
00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:50,474
What do you know?

817
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:51,852
How to kill the shit
out of It!

818
00:47:53,032 --> 00:47:54,617
I've read every book.

819
00:47:54,716 --> 00:47:57,218
I've talked to every person
in this godforsaken town,

820
00:47:57,318 --> 00:47:58,955
everybody that would talk to
me, anyway,

821
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:01,088
and that's not a long list.

822
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:02,390
But it wasn't enough.

823
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,693
I had to know
how this all started.

824
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:07,479
How It started.

825
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,720
And It started

826
00:48:15,888 --> 00:48:18,841
here.
Whoa.

827
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:22,044
What am I looking at, Mike?
It's an artifact.

828
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:24,446
Early 18th century Shokopiwah.

829
00:48:24,546 --> 00:48:26,916
Shoko
How'd you get it?

830
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:28,483
I found it, in the

831
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:30,952
No, no,
they gave it to me.

832
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:32,086
I stole it.

833
00:48:32,187 --> 00:48:34,122
You stole it?

834
00:48:34,222 --> 00:48:36,425
From Native Americans?
Uh

835
00:48:36,524 --> 00:48:39,796
It's complicated.
Yeah, it is.

836
00:48:39,896 --> 00:48:41,196
They helped me
on my journey.

837
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:43,030
So beautiful.

838
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:46,267
They showed me things.
A vision.

839
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:47,367
Ow.

840
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,338
Holy fuck.

841
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:51,439
I feel kind of funky.

842
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:52,539
Hot.

843
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:53,742
Am I sweating?

844
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:55,945
I need you to see
what they showed me, Bill.

845
00:48:56,044 --> 00:48:57,044
Bill.

846
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:03,117
They live outside of Derry.

847
00:49:03,218 --> 00:49:05,254
Beyond It's reach.

848
00:49:05,354 --> 00:49:07,539
They moved there
many years ago.

849
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,191
Their holy man,

850
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:12,611
their holy of holies,

851
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,981
he took me in.

852
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:18,785
Fed me their sacred Maturin.

853
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:22,704
I started to
To react.

854
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:25,807
All living things
must abide by the laws

855
00:49:25,908 --> 00:49:27,459
of the shape they inhabit.

856
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:35,617
While I sat there,
looking out over the valley,

857
00:49:35,718 --> 00:49:37,803
I saw It arrive.

858
00:49:41,975 --> 00:49:45,561
I knew that one day,
I would have to make you all see.

859
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,660
Mike,

860
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:50,783
did you put something
in my drink?

861
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:53,769
It's, uh

862
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:55,004
It's a root.

863
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:56,303
You

864
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:57,783
You drugged me?
You drugged me?

865
00:49:57,883 --> 00:49:59,508
No, it's a root
with properties.

866
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:01,883
It's just a micro-dose of
what the Shokopiwah gave me

867
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:02,983
Why would you do that?

868
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:04,713
to open my eyes.

869
00:50:04,814 --> 00:50:06,381
I don't feel real good.

870
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:09,619
I need you to look,

871
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:10,820
and you'll see.

872
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,789
I don't feel good.

873
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:14,256
Open your eyes.

874
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:16,158
Open your eyes.

875
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:18,443
They showed me the past.

876
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:27,754
Showed me the way
It appeared to them.

877
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:42,068
They showed me
their pain.

878
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:48,272
They showed me
how to stop It!

879
00:50:58,182 --> 00:50:59,367
It's over.

880
00:50:59,468 --> 00:51:00,937
It's over.
You're okay.

881
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:04,039
You're okay.
Did you see it?

882
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,407
The ritual?

883
00:51:05,506 --> 00:51:07,263
The Ritual of Chud?
Yeah, I knew you

884
00:51:07,363 --> 00:51:09,812
I knew you would see it.

885
00:51:09,912 --> 00:51:13,015
I saw the whole fucking
thing, Mike.

886
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,401
That's how we kill It.

887
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:23,660
How are we going
to do it?

888
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,129
Everybody already
said no.

889
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:28,914
But with you,

890
00:51:31,084 --> 00:51:33,367
they'll listen.

891
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:36,354
This won't work
without all of us.

892
00:51:39,758 --> 00:51:42,544
Okay. So, what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

893
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,012
Yeah,
'cause I gotta be honest.

894
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:46,153
That's a fucked-up thing
to just drop on somebody.

895
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,901
Every night since Derry,

896
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:52,738
I've been having
these nightmares.

897
00:51:54,338 --> 00:51:57,443
People in pain.
People dying.

898
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,995
People

899
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:00,428
So, you have nightmares.

900
00:52:00,528 --> 00:52:02,486
I have nightmares.
People, they have nightmares.

901
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,718
But that doesn't mean
that your visions are true.

902
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:10,504
I've watched
every single one of us

903
00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:12,791
You've seen
every single one of us what?

904
00:52:17,597 --> 00:52:19,865
At the place that
Stanley wound up.

905
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:24,120
That's how we end.

906
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,888
Okay, how come the rest of
us aren't seeing that shit?

907
00:52:26,988 --> 00:52:28,466
I mean,
what makes her so different?

908
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:29,709
The Deadlights.

909
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:33,445
The Deadlights.

910
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:47,876
She was the only
one of us

911
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:50,294
that got caught in
the Deadlights that day.

912
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:52,948
We were all
touched by It.

913
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:54,448
Changed.

914
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:58,352
Deep down. Like an infection.
Or a virus.

915
00:52:58,452 --> 00:53:00,756
A virus.
You understand.

916
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:02,091
Slowly growing.

917
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:05,426
That virus,
it's been growing for 27 years.

918
00:53:05,526 --> 00:53:07,562
This whole time,
metastasizing.

919
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:09,180
It just got to Stan
first, because

920
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,280
He was the weakest.

921
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:11,800
Jesus Christ, Rich.

922
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:13,858
Just saying what everyone
else is thinking, man.

923
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,204
I mean,
Rich, come on.

924
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:18,106
What Beverly sees,
it will come to pass.

925
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,044
It's what'll happen to
all of us, eventually,

926
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:21,408
unless we stop It.

927
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:23,149
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

928
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:25,396
The Ritual of Chud.

929
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,550
The Shokopiwah.

930
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:31,821
The first ones who fought
It, they have a saying.

931
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:33,823
"All living things
must abide by

932
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:35,441
"the laws of the
shape they inhabit."

933
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:36,608
A tribal ritual?

934
00:53:38,443 --> 00:53:39,796
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

935
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:41,597
All right,
there's gotta be another way.

936
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:43,733
Okay? This thing comes
back, what, every 27 years?

937
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,990
Let's just kick the can down
the road and do it then.

938
00:53:46,091 --> 00:53:47,608
Wait, we'll be 70 years
old, asshole.

939
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,321
It doesn't
work that way.

940
00:53:50,657 --> 00:53:52,457
None of us make it
another 20 years,

941
00:53:53,392 --> 00:53:54,894
and the way it happens

942
00:53:57,196 --> 00:54:00,115
So, if we don't beat It
this cycle, then

943
00:54:00,216 --> 00:54:01,615
We die.

944
00:54:01,751 --> 00:54:02,785
Horribly.

945
00:54:02,885 --> 00:54:04,586
Yeah, I don't need
the "horribly" part.

946
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:06,321
I didn't say it.
She said it. Not me.

947
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:07,722
All right, guys.
Look.

948
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:10,609
I've seen
what he's talking about,

949
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:13,780
and it's all true.

950
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:16,515
It's the only way.

951
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:19,535
If we want
this ritual to work

952
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:20,954
We have to remember.

953
00:54:22,354 --> 00:54:24,791
Remember what?

954
00:54:29,629 --> 00:54:31,463
It's better
if I show you.

955
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,499
We don't have
much time.

956
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:38,437
His cycle
will end soon.

957
00:54:40,305 --> 00:54:41,591
And once it does

958
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:42,941
We're fucked.

959
00:55:05,664 --> 00:55:07,448
The Barrens.

960
00:55:07,548 --> 00:55:09,167
This is where we came.

961
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:11,905
After the rock fight.

962
00:55:13,238 --> 00:55:14,439
The clubhouse.

963
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,858
You built that for us.

964
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:19,075
Yeah, the hatch has got to
be around here someplace.

965
00:55:19,175 --> 00:55:20,334
You did.
I do remember that!

966
00:55:20,434 --> 00:55:21,981
Oh!
Whoa! Whoa!

967
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:24,751
You okay?

968
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:29,488
What?
Nothing, it's just

969
00:55:30,689 --> 00:55:32,024
You haven't changed.

970
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:34,294
It's a good thing.

971
00:55:38,897 --> 00:55:41,633
You know what?
I actually think the door was more like

972
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:43,937
around

973
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,443
Found it.

974
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:53,211
I'm okay!

975
00:55:53,946 --> 00:55:55,013
Come down!

976
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:13,515
What the dick is this?

977
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:14,968
How'd you build it?

978
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:17,919
When did you build it?

979
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:20,088
Here and there,
I guess.

980
00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:21,745
It was already dug
out from something,

981
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,925
so I just had to
reinforce the walls

982
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:25,628
and get some wood
for the roof door,

983
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:27,428
and that's pretty much it.

984
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:29,513
Pretty good for
my first time, huh?

985
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,535
Now,
that's a cool feature.

986
00:56:33,635 --> 00:56:35,073
What happens when
you put your hand

987
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:36,537
on the other pillar,
professor?

988
00:56:36,637 --> 00:56:38,994
Okay, you see, this is exactly
why there are safety codes,

989
00:56:39,093 --> 00:56:40,276
why we have permits.

990
00:56:40,376 --> 00:56:42,334
This place is a death trap.
You understand that?

991
00:56:42,434 --> 00:56:44,191
Well, it's a work in progress.
Okay, Eddie?

992
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,129
Just so you know, I get
hurt, you are liable.

993
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:48,425
And, also, what is this?
The switch of an iron maiden?

994
00:56:48,524 --> 00:56:49,524
That's a flashlight.

995
00:56:49,624 --> 00:56:50,782
What is that,
a horse hitch?

996
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:52,160
When do you have
horses down

997
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,260
Oh, this is cool.

998
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:54,557
That was like,
three dollars,

999
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:55,937
so be careful with that, please.

1000
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:57,872
I have one of these.
Hey, Stan, you see this?

1001
00:56:57,961 --> 00:56:59,200
Yeah, okay,
can you maybe not?

1002
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:01,394
Maybe not what? Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Maybe not what?

1003
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:02,448
Be awesome and have fun

1004
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:04,240
and celebrate the magic
of the paddle-ball?

1005
00:57:04,515 --> 00:57:05,515
Wow.

1006
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:07,905
Oh, good going, fucknut.
You broke his thing.

1007
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:09,004
I broke it?
Yeah,

1008
00:57:09,104 --> 00:57:10,271
you broke it
with your face.

1009
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:11,372
What?

1010
00:57:12,173 --> 00:57:13,934
I'm not putting
my fucking hand down there.

1011
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,234
Oh, man.
That's so cool.

1012
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:25,220
Oh, my God.

1013
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:28,691
How do we all not
remember that this was here?

1014
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:30,675
Hey, Losers.

1015
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:34,981
Time to float.

1016
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:41,736
Ahh!
Fuck, Richie.

1017
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,394
Dude!
Remember when he used to say

1018
00:57:43,495 --> 00:57:45,992
that shit?
And he'd do that little dance.

1019
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:50,079
Am I the only one
who remembers this shit?

1020
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:53,215
Are you gonna be like this
the entire time we're home?

1021
00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:55,550
All right. Just trying to
add some levity to this shit.

1022
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:57,169
I'll go fuck myself.

1023
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:01,039
It smells so fucking
terrible in here.

1024
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:06,278
Hey, you guys?

1025
00:58:07,814 --> 00:58:11,149
This says "Stan."

1026
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:14,187
"For the use
of Losers only."

1027
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:17,722
Bill.

1028
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:28,751
The fuck is this?

1029
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,088
So you don't get
spiders stuck

1030
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:31,626
in your hair
when you're down here.

1031
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:33,564
Stanley, we're not afraid
of fucking spiders.

1032
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:37,742
I stand corrected.

1033
00:58:38,678 --> 00:58:39,879
That's a first.

1034
00:58:40,379 --> 00:58:41,778
Touche.

1035
00:58:42,064 --> 00:58:43,631
Hey, Rich,
your ten minutes are up.

1036
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:45,100
What are you talking about?

1037
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,957
The hammock.
Ten minutes each was the rule.

1038
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,416
I don't see any sign.
Are you

1039
00:58:48,515 --> 00:58:50,352
being this way right now?
Really? No, no, no.

1040
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:52,689
Why would there be a sign if
it was a verbal agreement?

1041
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:54,827
And I remember you agreeing
on the fucking rule!

1042
00:58:56,394 --> 00:58:57,680
I can see your vagina!

1043
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,314
Ten minutes each.

1044
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,066
Go back in
your dumb little corner!

1045
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:03,285
I fucked your mom!

1046
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:06,187
No, you didn't.
Take that back!

1047
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:08,274
You're awfully good at
this, new kid.

1048
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:10,709
You really think so?

1049
00:59:12,077 --> 00:59:14,229
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor.

1050
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:16,327
Teaches you, like,
everything about architecture.

1051
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:17,624
I was thinking about applying.

1052
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:18,901
I'll do that.

1053
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:21,769
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry.

1054
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,905
Man, when I graduate,
I'm going to Florida.

1055
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:25,791
What's in Florida, Mike?

1056
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:28,443
I don't know.

1057
00:59:28,544 --> 00:59:30,901
You know, I guess it's just a
place I always wanted to go.

1058
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,678
Stan, you should go
with Mike to Florida.

1059
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:33,983
You already act 80.

1060
00:59:34,082 --> 00:59:35,602
You'd clean up with all the grandmas.

1061
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:41,307
Do you guys think
we'll still be friends?

1062
00:59:43,575 --> 00:59:44,894
When we're older?

1063
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:45,994
What?

1064
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:49,664
Why wouldn't we be?

1065
00:59:49,765 --> 00:59:51,282
Do any of your parents
still hang out

1066
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,939
with their friends
from middle school?

1067
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:56,789
I mean, things might
be different then.

1068
00:59:57,923 --> 00:59:59,858
We all might be different.

1069
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,513
We'll always still be friends.

1070
01:00:04,613 --> 01:00:06,849
I don't think that just,
you know,

1071
01:00:06,948 --> 01:00:09,068
goes away
because we get older.

1072
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:12,338
Yeah, Stan. Come on.

1073
01:00:14,807 --> 01:00:17,459
You don't have
to be so

1074
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:18,559
Sad.

1075
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:25,200
He was old
before his time.

1076
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Yeah.

1077
01:00:27,336 --> 01:00:29,972
I wonder what he was
like all grown up.

1078
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:31,990
Probably what he
was like as a kid.

1079
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:36,495
The best.

1080
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:38,796
Here.

1081
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:42,934
All right, Mike.
What are we doing here?

1082
01:00:44,236 --> 01:00:45,354
The ritual.

1083
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:47,856
To perform it
requires a sacrifice.

1084
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:50,492
Sacrifice? I nominate Eddie.
Wait, what?

1085
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:52,550
Because you're little.
You'll fit on a barbeque.

1086
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,006
I'm 5'9". It's, like,
average height in most of the world.

1087
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:57,383
It's not that kind of
a sacrifice, guys.

1088
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,350
Mike?

1089
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,171
The past is buried.

1090
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:04,439
But you're gonna have
to dig it up.

1091
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:06,508
Piece by piece.

1092
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:07,843
And these pieces,

1093
01:01:07,943 --> 01:01:09,528
these artifacts,

1094
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:12,131
that's why we're here.

1095
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,800
They are
what you'll sacrifice.

1096
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,321
And since Stan
isn't here to find his

1097
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:21,390
I figured we should
all be here together

1098
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,008
to find his artifact.

1099
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:27,280
I think Bill just did that.

1100
01:01:32,285 --> 01:01:34,370
Okay, Mike, so where
do we find our tokens?

1101
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,347
Yeah, I gotta be honest, man.
All due respect.

1102
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:38,374
This is fucking stupid,
all right?

1103
01:01:38,474 --> 01:01:40,008
Why do we need tokens?
All right?

1104
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:41,611
We already remember
everything.

1105
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:42,910
Saving Bev,
defeating It

1106
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,879
I mean,
we're caught up!

1107
01:01:44,979 --> 01:01:46,298
It's not everything.

1108
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:50,001
We fought.
But what happened after that?

1109
01:01:51,102 --> 01:01:53,039
Before the house
on Neibolt.

1110
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,441
Think.

1111
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:00,428
We can't
remember, can we?

1112
01:02:00,528 --> 01:02:02,532
See, there's more to our story.

1113
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:03,983
What happened that summer.

1114
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:06,602
And those blank spaces,

1115
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:08,803
like pages torn out of a book.

1116
01:02:08,903 --> 01:02:11,340
That's what
you need to find.

1117
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:13,108
We need to split up.

1118
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:15,477
You each need to
find your artifact.

1119
01:02:15,577 --> 01:02:17,446
Alone.
That's important.

1120
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:18,546
When you do,

1121
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,316
meet me
at the library tonight.

1122
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,251
Yeah,
I gotta say,

1123
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:25,588
statistically speaking,
you look at survival scenarios,

1124
01:02:25,689 --> 01:02:27,245
we're gonna do much
better as a group.

1125
01:02:27,345 --> 01:02:28,903
Yeah, splitting up
would be dumb, man.

1126
01:02:29,004 --> 01:02:30,561
Okay, we gotta go together.
All right?

1127
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,494
We were together that
summer, right?

1128
01:02:32,593 --> 01:02:33,593
No.

1129
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:38,800
Not that
whole summer.

1130
01:02:38,901 --> 01:02:40,401
Take it back.

1131
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:41,501
Bill!

1132
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:45,157
You're just
a bunch of losers.

1133
01:02:45,758 --> 01:02:46,841
Fuck off!

1134
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:48,461
Fucking
Stop!

1135
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:52,914
We were all together
when we hurt It.

1136
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:55,149
That's why
we're still alive.

1137
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:57,937
Yeah? Well,
I plan to keep it that way.

1138
01:03:07,046 --> 01:03:08,097
I bet by tomorrow,

1139
01:03:08,196 --> 01:03:09,481
we'll all be
back together.

1140
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:13,501
I don't think so.

1141
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:15,655
Well, if we're gonna stop
It, we better be.

1142
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,091
Maybe Richie was right.

1143
01:03:20,693 --> 01:03:24,412
Maybe we shouldn't do anything about
It, or maybe we can't.

1144
01:03:24,512 --> 01:03:26,816
Okay, don't let them
get to you.

1145
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:28,602
It's a little late
for that.

1146
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:33,972
You should go.

1147
01:03:35,573 --> 01:03:37,410
Before your dad sees.

1148
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:12,977
Yes?

1149
01:04:14,713 --> 01:04:16,015
Sorry. I

1150
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,568
May I help you?

1151
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:20,936
I thought I rang Marsh.

1152
01:04:21,035 --> 01:04:22,236
Marsh?

1153
01:04:23,622 --> 01:04:25,090
Alvin Marsh?

1154
01:04:25,624 --> 01:04:27,091
My father.

1155
01:04:27,827 --> 01:04:29,528
I grew up here.

1156
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,001
Dear,

1157
01:04:37,452 --> 01:04:40,890
it's not for me to
tell you this,

1158
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:43,309
but your father
passed away.

1159
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:48,079
I'm so sorry.
You didn't know?

1160
01:04:50,883 --> 01:04:53,803
We hadn't spoken
in a while.

1161
01:04:53,903 --> 01:04:56,004
Well, won't you
come in?

1162
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,106
Let me offer you
something to drink.

1163
01:04:58,205 --> 01:05:01,108
No, it's fine.
I have to go.

1164
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:03,696
It's the least
I can do.

1165
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:08,033
Sure. Okay.

1166
01:05:20,012 --> 01:05:22,532
Is it like you remember?

1167
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,231
Cleaner.

1168
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:26,602
Well, you feel free
to look around

1169
01:05:26,702 --> 01:05:28,504
while I get
the water boiling.

1170
01:05:28,604 --> 01:05:30,602
Oh, really, it's fine.
You don't need to do that.

1171
01:05:30,702 --> 01:05:33,091
Don't be so polite.

1172
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:03,155
Today is her birthday.

1173
01:06:07,325 --> 01:06:09,193
I can still smell
her perfume.

1174
01:06:12,363 --> 01:06:14,800
And she'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

1175
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,387
Mama was sick.

1176
01:06:18,486 --> 01:06:22,057
You know that's why
she did what she did.

1177
01:06:22,157 --> 01:06:24,292
She did what she did

1178
01:06:24,392 --> 01:06:28,479
because she was embarrassed
to be your mother.

1179
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:31,651
You look like her.

1180
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,789
But you are nothing
like her.

1181
01:06:39,626 --> 01:06:41,126
Come here.

1182
01:06:43,662 --> 01:06:45,599
I said come here!

1183
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:49,702
Close your eyes.

1184
01:07:05,383 --> 01:07:08,169
You know that I
would never hurt you.

1185
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:09,521
You know that,
don't you?

1186
01:07:19,298 --> 01:07:21,783
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1187
01:07:21,883 --> 01:07:25,169
You'll always be my little
girl, won't you?

1188
01:07:25,872 --> 01:07:27,271
Always.

1189
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,713
"Your hair is winter fire,

1190
01:08:40,512 --> 01:08:43,264
"January embers

1191
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:45,919
"My heart burns
there, too."

1192
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:05,755
There. I do apologize.

1193
01:09:05,854 --> 01:09:11,160
It gets so very hot
here this time of year.

1194
01:09:11,259 --> 01:09:12,695
It's fine.

1195
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:16,598
Well, you feel like you
could just about die.

1196
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:19,768
But you know what
they say about Derry.

1197
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:23,990
"No one who dies here
ever really dies."

1198
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:40,039
But tell me,
how is it being back in Derry?

1199
01:09:42,241 --> 01:09:44,192
It's good.
Strange.

1200
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,893
Strange?

1201
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:47,461
Oh, my.

1202
01:09:47,562 --> 01:09:49,948
Strange, how?

1203
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:52,651
Oh.

1204
01:09:53,803 --> 01:09:56,872
I had some cookies in
the oven before you came.

1205
01:09:56,973 --> 01:09:58,273
You stay right there.

1206
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:00,509
I really I shouldn't impose
I'm gonna

1207
01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:03,362
No, no, no. I insist.

1208
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,853
Mrs. Kersh,
are these your family?

1209
01:10:10,952 --> 01:10:12,387
Yes, dear.

1210
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:16,457
My father came to this country
with $14 in his pocket.

1211
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:18,760
And he didn't ask
for a handout

1212
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,530
the way that people
come in here these days.

1213
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,198
You know what he did?

1214
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:25,366
What did he do,
Mrs. Kersh?

1215
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:28,487
My father joined the circus.

1216
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:48,907
I was always
Daddy's little girl.

1217
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:51,109
What about you?

1218
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:58,584
Are you still
his little girl, Beverly?

1219
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:03,421
Are you?

1220
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:17,704
Mustn't lie
to our father!

1221
01:11:24,109 --> 01:11:25,109
Help!

1222
01:11:25,492 --> 01:11:28,292
Run, run, run.

1223
01:11:29,182 --> 01:11:30,982
Run, run.

1224
01:11:33,652 --> 01:11:37,857
You haven't
changed anything yet.

1225
01:11:40,558 --> 01:11:44,764
You haven't
changed their futures.

1226
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:52,536
You You haven't
saved any of them.

1227
01:11:56,474 --> 01:11:58,542
Close your eyes, Bev.

1228
01:11:59,112 --> 01:12:00,161
Fuck you!

1229
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:02,447
If you don't believe,

1230
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:06,952
close them

1231
01:12:08,054 --> 01:12:09,653
and see!

1232
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:11,250
Come on, you.
Come on.

1233
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:15,004
Ken,
you little bitch

1234
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:16,103
Yes!

1235
01:13:16,205 --> 01:13:17,339
You're fucking good.

1236
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:19,439
Game over.

1237
01:13:21,827 --> 01:13:24,030
Ah, well, I gotta go.
Hey!

1238
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:25,528
Um

1239
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:29,919
How about we
go again?

1240
01:13:30,018 --> 01:13:31,452
Play some more,
you know?

1241
01:13:31,553 --> 01:13:33,022
Fuck you, man.

1242
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,139
Only if you want to.

1243
01:13:38,576 --> 01:13:40,929
Dude, why are you
being weird?

1244
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:42,665
I'm not
your fucking boyfriend.

1245
01:13:42,764 --> 01:13:44,566
Whoa, I
I didn't

1246
01:13:44,665 --> 01:13:46,500
What the fuck's
going on here?

1247
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,803
You assholes
didn't tell me

1248
01:13:47,902 --> 01:13:49,604
your town is
full of little fairies.

1249
01:13:49,705 --> 01:13:51,173
Richie fucking Tozier?

1250
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:54,027
What? You're trying to
bone my little cousin?

1251
01:13:56,094 --> 01:13:57,796
Get the fuck out of
here, faggot!

1252
01:14:02,134 --> 01:14:03,635
Fucking move!

1253
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:28,126
Want a kiss, Richie?

1254
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,688
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1255
01:15:01,787 --> 01:15:04,183
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1256
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:06,680
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. It's not real.

1257
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:17,977
I think I just shit
my pants.

1258
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:33,329
Canal Days Festival.
Shit.

1259
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:35,044
Closing performance
is tonight.

1260
01:15:35,143 --> 01:15:37,095
Hope to see you there, handsome.

1261
01:15:43,902 --> 01:15:45,387
Did you miss
me, Richie?

1262
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:47,072
Oh, fuck!

1263
01:15:50,611 --> 01:15:52,879
'Cause I've missed you.

1264
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,600
No one wants to play
with the clown anymore.

1265
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:01,003
Play a game with me,
would ya?

1266
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:02,403
How about Street Fighter?

1267
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:04,756
Oh, yes.
You like that one, don't you?

1268
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,130
Or maybe
Truth or Dare?

1269
01:16:11,764 --> 01:16:12,848
Jesus.

1270
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:14,849
Oh, you wouldn't want

1271
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:18,454
anyone to pick "truth,"
though, would ya, Richie?

1272
01:16:18,554 --> 01:16:23,442
You wouldn't want anyone
to know what you're hiding.

1273
01:16:25,945 --> 01:16:28,898
♪ I know your secret ♪

1274
01:16:28,997 --> 01:16:32,468
♪ Your dirty, little secret ♪

1275
01:16:32,567 --> 01:16:35,737
♪ Oh, I know your secret ♪

1276
01:16:35,838 --> 01:16:38,156
♪ Your dirty, little secret ♪

1277
01:16:39,457 --> 01:16:41,309
Should I
tell them, Richie?

1278
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,147
This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

1279
01:16:45,246 --> 01:16:47,866
It isn't real. It isn't happening.
It isn't real.

1280
01:16:53,072 --> 01:16:54,956
Come back and play!

1281
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:58,811
Come back
and play with the clown!

1282
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:04,549
Whoa!

1283
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:08,353
I'm so sorry. Sorry.
Watch it, you jerk!

1284
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:12,390
Sorry.

1285
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:39,867
Oh, man!

1286
01:17:39,968 --> 01:17:42,271
Can I help you?
Hi.

1287
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:45,156
Yeah, I want to see about the

1288
01:17:46,392 --> 01:17:47,393
Baseball card?

1289
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,012
The bowling ball?

1290
01:17:50,112 --> 01:17:51,146
No, the

1291
01:17:51,246 --> 01:17:52,446
Banjo?

1292
01:17:53,549 --> 01:17:54,948
Beaver?

1293
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:57,085
Fucking bike.

1294
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:59,839
You wanna use
that kind of language,

1295
01:18:01,707 --> 01:18:03,325
take it out
in the street.

1296
01:18:03,424 --> 01:18:04,893
I'm sorry.

1297
01:18:04,992 --> 01:18:07,345
Can we just start over and
pretend that I just walked in?

1298
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:10,131
How can I help you?

1299
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:12,867
Thank you. Yes.
I want to buy the bike.

1300
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:15,237
Aren't you William
Denbrough, the writer?

1301
01:18:15,336 --> 01:18:16,673
Yeah, that's

1302
01:18:16,773 --> 01:18:17,973
That's me.

1303
01:18:18,072 --> 01:18:20,942
That bike
used to be mine.

1304
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:24,514
Well, it's mine now.

1305
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:25,781
But you're
the big author.

1306
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,366
You want it,
you can afford it.

1307
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:30,469
All right.
How much?

1308
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,540
$300.

1309
01:18:37,076 --> 01:18:38,510
You can afford it.

1310
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:40,763
I'll get it.

1311
01:18:40,862 --> 01:18:43,515
I guess
that's kind of a deal.

1312
01:18:53,992 --> 01:18:55,679
You You want me to
sign it for you?

1313
01:18:55,778 --> 01:18:56,778
Nah.

1314
01:18:56,911 --> 01:18:58,496
I didn't like the ending.

1315
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:02,834
Uh

1316
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:05,655
Three big ones.

1317
01:19:05,755 --> 01:19:07,423
All yours.
Uh-huh.

1318
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:09,541
I don't know
how fast she'll go.

1319
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,344
Been there
a lot of years.

1320
01:19:13,512 --> 01:19:15,481
You know what,
mister?

1321
01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:18,983
She was fast enough
to beat the devil.

1322
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:27,526
Come on.

1323
01:19:34,366 --> 01:19:36,369
Yeah,
I missed you, too.

1324
01:19:43,643 --> 01:19:44,643
Yeah!

1325
01:19:45,411 --> 01:19:46,411
Whoo!

1326
01:19:55,755 --> 01:19:58,240
Hi-ho, Silver!

1327
01:19:58,339 --> 01:19:59,339
Away!

1328
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:24,582
Bye, Billy!

1329
01:20:56,817 --> 01:20:58,099
I know you're
down there.

1330
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,585
I know you
can hear me.

1331
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:04,223
There's something
I have to know.

1332
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,697
All of the kids in this
town you could have taken,

1333
01:21:08,796 --> 01:21:10,496
why Georgie?

1334
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:18,137
Say something!

1335
01:21:20,473 --> 01:21:21,490
Why him?

1336
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:23,710
Why him?
Why him? Why him?

1337
01:21:43,996 --> 01:21:44,996
Why?

1338
01:21:49,635 --> 01:21:54,473
Because you weren't
there, Billy.

1339
01:22:09,688 --> 01:22:11,456
Billy,
don't leave.

1340
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:14,326
Hello?

1341
01:22:16,897 --> 01:22:18,097
Billy.

1342
01:22:22,602 --> 01:22:23,670
I'm still here.

1343
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:28,506
Help me.

1344
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:30,710
Georgie.

1345
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:37,716
Georgie?

1346
01:22:38,884 --> 01:22:40,385
Help me, Billy.

1347
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:42,972
Take my hand.

1348
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,807
Take my hand.

1349
01:22:44,906 --> 01:22:46,274
I've got you, buddy.
Come on.

1350
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:47,559
He's coming.

1351
01:22:48,561 --> 01:22:49,912
Take my hand!

1352
01:22:50,013 --> 01:22:52,089
I got you. Come on.
Billy, please. He's coming.

1353
01:22:52,189 --> 01:22:53,189
Take my hand.
Billy!

1354
01:22:53,289 --> 01:22:54,366
Come on,
take my hand!

1355
01:23:16,889 --> 01:23:18,523
I hate you!

1356
01:23:19,325 --> 01:23:21,524
I hate you.

1357
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,094
Who are
you talking to?

1358
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:26,214
Move, move, move!

1359
01:23:26,313 --> 01:23:28,416
Move! Move!

1360
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:30,756
You hear voices from that
sewer, you stay away from it.

1361
01:23:32,271 --> 01:23:34,607
You hear voices
from the sewer?

1362
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:36,075
No.

1363
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:38,844
No. Just stay away
from that sewer.

1364
01:23:42,048 --> 01:23:43,616
I only hear voices
in the tub.

1365
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,821
You know.
From the drain.

1366
01:23:49,521 --> 01:23:51,423
What kind of voices?

1367
01:23:52,156 --> 01:23:53,156
Kids.

1368
01:23:54,393 --> 01:23:56,713
And other times,
like a

1369
01:23:56,813 --> 01:23:57,831
Like a clown?

1370
01:24:03,803 --> 01:24:05,286
You listen to me.
You listen good.

1371
01:24:05,387 --> 01:24:07,723
You need to
get out of this town.

1372
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:09,741
All right? Tell your parents.
Make up a reason.

1373
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,956
You make up a fucking lie.
I don't care what you do.

1374
01:24:12,057 --> 01:24:13,535
Just get out of this town.
Make them

1375
01:24:13,634 --> 01:24:15,272
never bring you back.
Do you understand?

1376
01:24:15,371 --> 01:24:17,089
You leave Derry and
you stay out of Derry!

1377
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:18,189
Do you understand me?

1378
01:24:18,289 --> 01:24:19,727
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1379
01:24:19,826 --> 01:24:21,755
Tell me you understand!

1380
01:24:26,759 --> 01:24:29,045
I'm supposed to be
at the festival.

1381
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:30,796
I gotta go.

1382
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:34,901
Just be careful!

1383
01:25:17,408 --> 01:25:19,344
Come on,
let's get the fuck outta here.

1384
01:25:20,211 --> 01:25:22,380
Wake up, fat-ass.

1385
01:25:25,085 --> 01:25:26,786
Fucking loser.

1386
01:25:49,709 --> 01:25:50,709
Whoa.

1387
01:25:51,227 --> 01:25:54,295
Easy. It's just me.

1388
01:25:54,396 --> 01:25:57,165
What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?

1389
01:25:57,265 --> 01:26:00,469
Oh. Those guys are
definitely not my buddies.

1390
01:26:00,568 --> 01:26:02,269
No, I meant
your real friends.

1391
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,005
Joey. Jonathan.
Donnie. Danny.

1392
01:26:04,106 --> 01:26:05,106
Oh.

1393
01:26:09,195 --> 01:26:10,764
Are you smoking
in school?

1394
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:13,966
Secret hideout.

1395
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,367
Don't tell anyone.

1396
01:26:24,276 --> 01:26:25,862
You okay, new kid?

1397
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:27,446
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

1398
01:26:29,014 --> 01:26:31,549
I guess I'm just worried

1399
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:37,472
that we're not all gonna be
the same after the fight.

1400
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:39,625
As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?

1401
01:26:41,559 --> 01:26:42,762
You really mean that?

1402
01:26:45,697 --> 01:26:48,299
Well, yeah,
of course, dummy.

1403
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:54,372
You and me.

1404
01:27:00,045 --> 01:27:01,446
Oh, my God!

1405
01:27:03,282 --> 01:27:04,651
I meant as a friend.

1406
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:08,095
You actually thought
I could like someone

1407
01:27:08,196 --> 01:27:11,991
as fat and gross and
disgusting like you?

1408
01:27:13,591 --> 01:27:15,343
No matter
how many stupid poems

1409
01:27:15,442 --> 01:27:16,662
you write.

1410
01:27:24,402 --> 01:27:26,537
"Your hair is winter fire.

1411
01:27:32,911 --> 01:27:34,478
"January embers.

1412
01:27:36,883 --> 01:27:39,518
"My heart
burns there, too."

1413
01:28:04,811 --> 01:28:06,762
That's not the real Beverly.

1414
01:28:06,862 --> 01:28:09,430
Beverly would never
say anything like that.

1415
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:10,950
She'd never say that.

1416
01:28:25,798 --> 01:28:28,500
Kiss me, fat boy.

1417
01:28:38,576 --> 01:28:44,000
Oh, nobody wants to
kiss the fat boy.

1418
01:28:44,099 --> 01:28:45,366
Just leave me alone.

1419
01:28:45,466 --> 01:28:46,666
Alone?

1420
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:51,372
Oh, you've always
been alone.

1421
01:28:51,473 --> 01:28:54,609
That's not true.
I have real friends.

1422
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,612
Bill. Eddie. Mike. Stanley.
Richie. Beverly.

1423
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:58,514
They're my real friends.

1424
01:28:58,613 --> 01:29:02,301
Kiss me as if it
were the last time.

1425
01:29:09,675 --> 01:29:11,509
What the hell
are you doing, kid?

1426
01:29:28,061 --> 01:29:29,061
Guys?

1427
01:29:30,362 --> 01:29:31,362
Hey.

1428
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:34,165
Hey.

1429
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:38,286
So, what did you see
out there?

1430
01:29:38,387 --> 01:29:40,472
Something I wish
I hadn't.

1431
01:29:44,109 --> 01:29:45,509
So, what, we just

1432
01:29:48,414 --> 01:29:52,533
We kill It, and then we just
forget everything again?

1433
01:29:52,634 --> 01:29:54,903
I hope so.
Don't you?

1434
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:57,206
I don't know.

1435
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:00,142
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

1436
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:01,241
Mmm.

1437
01:30:01,608 --> 01:30:03,125
Come on.
There must be something from

1438
01:30:03,225 --> 01:30:05,130
the past that you don't
want to forget again.

1439
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,201
I remember
being scared shitless.

1440
01:30:10,169 --> 01:30:11,169
Cold.

1441
01:30:12,688 --> 01:30:15,124
I remember you guys
in your tighty-whities.

1442
01:30:15,223 --> 01:30:18,111
Okay. Please forget
that moment.

1443
01:30:19,746 --> 01:30:21,947
I remember this.

1444
01:30:24,183 --> 01:30:26,952
I remember the boy
who wrote it for me.

1445
01:30:29,389 --> 01:30:31,189
Not him, so much,

1446
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:35,661
but how he made me feel.

1447
01:30:38,598 --> 01:30:40,665
And a kiss.

1448
01:30:45,438 --> 01:30:49,290
It's still blurry,
but I think the longer we're here,

1449
01:30:49,390 --> 01:30:51,126
the more I can see it.

1450
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:53,562
The more I can see that moment.

1451
01:30:53,661 --> 01:30:55,081
The more
I can see

1452
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:57,116
Bill.

1453
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:01,219
I think.

1454
01:31:03,523 --> 01:31:06,224
I don't know.
Do you remember

1455
01:31:08,061 --> 01:31:10,061
Bev, um

1456
01:31:11,731 --> 01:31:13,682
Move. Move.
What's wrong?

1457
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:15,817
I'm leaving.

1458
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:17,420
What?
You can't leave, man.

1459
01:31:17,519 --> 01:31:19,054
We split,
we all die.

1460
01:31:19,155 --> 01:31:21,274
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
We're gonna die, anyway.

1461
01:31:21,808 --> 01:31:24,008
Rich. Um

1462
01:31:26,144 --> 01:31:27,144
Rich.

1463
01:31:29,214 --> 01:31:31,834
Hey, kids!
It's Burrow the Beaver!

1464
01:31:31,933 --> 01:31:34,103
Come on down.
It's the last day

1465
01:31:34,202 --> 01:31:36,555
of the festival here
at Canal Days.

1466
01:31:38,357 --> 01:31:39,357
Ahh!

1467
01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:41,126
Asshole!

1468
01:31:54,807 --> 01:31:56,006
Hello?

1469
01:32:08,454 --> 01:32:09,737
Can I help you?

1470
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:11,240
Yeah, I called in

1471
01:32:11,339 --> 01:32:13,059
I had prescription
called in for Kaspbrak.

1472
01:32:13,459 --> 01:32:14,643
Kaspbrak?

1473
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:15,928
It's an inhaler.

1474
01:32:17,463 --> 01:32:20,549
Uh Eddie Kaspbrak?

1475
01:32:20,648 --> 01:32:22,201
Mmm-hmm.
That's me.

1476
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:24,704
I remember you.

1477
01:32:25,138 --> 01:32:26,138
Yeah.

1478
01:32:26,388 --> 01:32:27,923
Mmm-hmm.
How's your mom?

1479
01:32:28,023 --> 01:32:29,758
Oh, uh
Well, she died a few years ago.

1480
01:32:29,857 --> 01:32:31,495
It's very sad.
It was from liver cancer.

1481
01:32:31,594 --> 01:32:32,594
What's that?

1482
01:32:32,693 --> 01:32:34,647
What's what?
That.

1483
01:32:35,915 --> 01:32:37,665
All right.
Uh-huh.

1484
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:38,765
Okay.

1485
01:32:39,067 --> 01:32:41,303
No, it's not gonna pop.
It's a mole.

1486
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:43,505
It might not be cancer.

1487
01:32:43,606 --> 01:32:44,790
Cancer?

1488
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,676
But it might be.

1489
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:50,546
You just stay here.

1490
01:32:50,647 --> 01:32:52,598
I'll get you something.

1491
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:55,399
Okay.

1492
01:33:05,076 --> 01:33:07,345
You came here for your
stinky breath pills?

1493
01:33:08,848 --> 01:33:11,032
My breath
is fine.

1494
01:33:11,133 --> 01:33:12,867
Thank you.

1495
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:15,604
That's not
what my dad said.

1496
01:33:15,705 --> 01:33:17,689
He said you have a tumor.

1497
01:33:20,326 --> 01:33:21,628
On your dick.

1498
01:33:22,862 --> 01:33:25,164
But you don't
take pills for

1499
01:33:27,133 --> 01:33:28,433
Wait, what did
your dad say?

1500
01:33:29,434 --> 01:33:30,702
There you go.

1501
01:33:32,004 --> 01:33:33,244
I hope your dick
feels better.

1502
01:33:35,473 --> 01:33:36,841
Thank you.

1503
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:41,463
For the inhaler,
not for the penis thing.

1504
01:33:41,563 --> 01:33:42,763
Eddie!

1505
01:33:46,751 --> 01:33:48,853
Eddie bear!

1506
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,290
Mommy?

1507
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:01,166
Eddie bear!

1508
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:05,871
Mommy?

1509
01:34:08,941 --> 01:34:11,244
Eddie, come help me!
Quick!

1510
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,359
Eddie!

1511
01:34:29,778 --> 01:34:30,978
Mommy?

1512
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,414
Eddie?

1513
01:34:32,514 --> 01:34:33,881
Eddie, help me!

1514
01:34:33,982 --> 01:34:35,416
Quick, help me!

1515
01:34:35,517 --> 01:34:36,716
Mommy?

1516
01:34:37,853 --> 01:34:39,905
Eddie bear,
come help me, quick!

1517
01:34:56,723 --> 01:34:57,923
Eddie?

1518
01:34:58,941 --> 01:35:00,576
The fuck
is she doing here?

1519
01:35:00,676 --> 01:35:01,977
What is taking you
so long?

1520
01:35:02,076 --> 01:35:04,130
I don't know.
Why are you here?

1521
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:14,738
Mommy!

1522
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:16,866
He's coming!
You gotta get me outta here!

1523
01:35:16,966 --> 01:35:18,576
Who's coming?
Eddie.

1524
01:35:20,246 --> 01:35:22,214
What the fuck is that?

1525
01:35:29,155 --> 01:35:31,173
Mommy.
You gotta get me outta here.

1526
01:35:31,273 --> 01:35:32,709
He's coming!

1527
01:35:32,808 --> 01:35:34,809
He's gonna kill me!
Eddie!

1528
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:38,313
Help! Please, help me!
He's going to infect me!

1529
01:35:38,414 --> 01:35:40,982
Eddie! He's gonna infect me!
Eddie!

1530
01:35:41,082 --> 01:35:42,683
Help me!

1531
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:46,589
Help me, Eddie!
He's coming, Eddie!

1532
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,223
Eddie, hurry!

1533
01:35:49,323 --> 01:35:51,443
He's gonna infect me, Eddie!

1534
01:35:54,146 --> 01:35:55,348
Oh, my God!
Eddie!

1535
01:35:56,549 --> 01:35:57,582
Hurry up, Eddie!

1536
01:36:03,656 --> 01:36:04,857
Eddie!

1537
01:36:12,865 --> 01:36:14,549
I can't do it!
Eddie! Eddie!

1538
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:17,251
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

1539
01:36:17,352 --> 01:36:20,171
I knew you would leave me, Eddie!

1540
01:36:22,407 --> 01:36:23,908
Eddie, help me!

1541
01:36:29,548 --> 01:36:30,683
Eddie!

1542
01:36:35,554 --> 01:36:37,973
What's all this shit
doing here?

1543
01:36:38,072 --> 01:36:39,991
Why is that curtain
still here?

1544
01:36:40,593 --> 01:36:41,678
Okay, all right.

1545
01:36:41,777 --> 01:36:43,978
Are you gonna
do this, Eds?

1546
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:45,246
It's just a memory.

1547
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:46,750
It's just a memory.
You're fine.

1548
01:36:46,849 --> 01:36:49,167
Deep breath.
Deep breath.

1549
01:36:49,969 --> 01:36:52,237
Okay.
You gonna do it?

1550
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:03,750
Shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

1551
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:11,456
Stop! Stop!

1552
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:33,312
That's right!

1553
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,179
Fuck you!

1554
01:37:36,365 --> 01:37:38,165
Fuck you!

1555
01:37:51,764 --> 01:37:53,198
What the fuck?

1556
01:37:57,838 --> 01:37:58,838
What?

1557
01:37:59,454 --> 01:38:01,122
Push, don't pull,
you moron.

1558
01:38:01,223 --> 01:38:03,408
Oh. Thanks.

1559
01:38:17,589 --> 01:38:19,974
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

1560
01:38:20,075 --> 01:38:21,276
Nothing. I'm fine.

1561
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:23,362
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1562
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:26,554
Hey, how you doing?
Where's everybody else?

1563
01:38:26,655 --> 01:38:27,655
Richie wants to leave.

1564
01:38:27,754 --> 01:38:29,432
Ben's upstairs
trying to get him to stay.

1565
01:38:29,531 --> 01:38:31,085
Eddie's just scared.

1566
01:38:31,186 --> 01:38:32,420
So am I, Bill.

1567
01:38:32,521 --> 01:38:33,956
Aren't you?

1568
01:38:34,055 --> 01:38:35,591
We're all scared.

1569
01:38:35,692 --> 01:38:36,792
That's what worries me.

1570
01:38:36,893 --> 01:38:38,192
Because that's
what It wants.

1571
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:39,562
We can do this,

1572
01:38:39,661 --> 01:38:41,080
but we have
to stick together.

1573
01:39:39,304 --> 01:39:40,723
Should we be running?

1574
01:39:40,822 --> 01:39:42,642
This is Derry.
I'm kinda getting used to it.

1575
01:40:11,871 --> 01:40:12,871
What does that mean?

1576
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:16,107
Shit. It's the kid.

1577
01:40:16,776 --> 01:40:17,776
What?

1578
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:20,597
It's the kid
from the place.

1579
01:40:20,697 --> 01:40:21,731
The Chinese place.

1580
01:40:21,831 --> 01:40:22,908
I saw him
on the way here.

1581
01:40:23,009 --> 01:40:24,767
He lives
at my old house.

1582
01:40:24,866 --> 01:40:26,786
He was going to the fair, and

1583
01:40:30,255 --> 01:40:31,932
He's going to the fair.
I gotta help him.

1584
01:40:32,031 --> 01:40:33,830
Okay, okay. Listen to me.
We'll go together.

1585
01:40:33,929 --> 01:40:35,648
I'm gonna get Richie
and Ben and we'll go.

1586
01:40:35,747 --> 01:40:38,213
There's no time.
I can't let it happen again.

1587
01:40:38,313 --> 01:40:39,910
What happened before
wasn't your fault.

1588
01:40:40,009 --> 01:40:41,009
None of it was.

1589
01:40:41,108 --> 01:40:42,602
I wish
that were true, Bev.

1590
01:40:45,204 --> 01:40:47,204
Bill! Bev!

1591
01:40:47,689 --> 01:40:49,858
What is this? What happened?
Uh

1592
01:40:49,959 --> 01:40:51,093
Did Bill just leave?

1593
01:40:51,192 --> 01:40:52,227
I couldn't stop him.

1594
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:53,595
Everybody's leaving.

1595
01:40:53,696 --> 01:40:55,374
It's all right. It's Bill.
He'll be back.

1596
01:40:55,473 --> 01:40:57,098
He'll come back.

1597
01:40:57,198 --> 01:40:59,384
Well, at least
I got Richie to stay.

1598
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:03,287
Fuck. Oh.

1599
01:41:20,139 --> 01:41:22,097
Oh. And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

1600
01:41:22,197 --> 01:41:23,197
"Hey, it's Mike Hanlon.

1601
01:41:23,295 --> 01:41:24,733
"Why don't you
come back to Maine?"

1602
01:41:27,513 --> 01:41:29,281
It's your time, Eddie.

1603
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:31,884
What?

1604
01:41:34,653 --> 01:41:35,653
Why?

1605
01:41:36,037 --> 01:41:37,674
Why did you do that?

1606
01:41:37,773 --> 01:41:40,408
Because he says
it's your time.

1607
01:41:40,509 --> 01:41:42,428
Who says it's my time?

1608
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:46,014
You know, Eddie.

1609
01:41:46,115 --> 01:41:47,915
You know.

1610
01:41:48,216 --> 01:41:50,135
Time to float.

1611
01:41:56,274 --> 01:41:57,876
Where did he go?

1612
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:03,649
Now give me back
my fucking knife!

1613
01:42:20,933 --> 01:42:22,371
You should cut
that fucking mullet.

1614
01:42:22,472 --> 01:42:24,186
It's been, like,
30 years, man.

1615
01:42:24,286 --> 01:42:25,286
Guys!

1616
01:42:27,639 --> 01:42:28,741
Oh, shit.

1617
01:42:30,576 --> 01:42:31,576
Eds?

1618
01:42:33,512 --> 01:42:35,831
Jesus, Eds.
What the hell?

1619
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:37,515
Bowers is in my room.
Oh, my

1620
01:42:39,919 --> 01:42:41,653
Is it bad?
No.

1621
01:42:56,367 --> 01:42:57,954
I'm gonna
carve my whole name

1622
01:42:58,054 --> 01:42:59,338
onto this cottage cheese!

1623
01:43:06,478 --> 01:43:07,914
One down!

1624
01:43:09,148 --> 01:43:10,649
Fuck yeah!

1625
01:43:38,044 --> 01:43:39,044
Hey!

1626
01:43:39,361 --> 01:43:41,345
Hey, kid! Kid!

1627
01:43:42,648 --> 01:43:44,767
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1628
01:43:44,866 --> 01:43:45,866
Hey!

1629
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:48,269
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Hey!

1630
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:49,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1631
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:53,791
Fuck.

1632
01:44:04,137 --> 01:44:05,137
Fuck!

1633
01:44:22,688 --> 01:44:24,423
Kid! Hey, kid!

1634
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,290
Fuck.

1635
01:44:26,992 --> 01:44:27,992
Kid?

1636
01:44:32,331 --> 01:44:33,331
Fuck.

1637
01:44:45,143 --> 01:44:46,143
Kid?

1638
01:44:46,746 --> 01:44:47,746
Hey!

1639
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:57,356
Kid.

1640
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:05,881
Kid? Hey! Hey!

1641
01:45:05,982 --> 01:45:06,982
Kid!

1642
01:45:07,349 --> 01:45:08,349
Fuck.

1643
01:45:09,969 --> 01:45:10,969
Shit.

1644
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:12,838
Hey.

1645
01:45:13,389 --> 01:45:14,421
What are you
doing here?

1646
01:45:14,522 --> 01:45:15,522
Hey.

1647
01:45:16,392 --> 01:45:18,894
No, I'm here to
help.

1648
01:45:18,995 --> 01:45:20,528
Stop following me!

1649
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:22,948
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1650
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:30,389
No.

1651
01:45:32,858 --> 01:45:33,926
Please.

1652
01:45:38,264 --> 01:45:39,264
Ah.

1653
01:45:39,915 --> 01:45:41,968
I'm here this time.
Just take me.

1654
01:45:47,973 --> 01:45:48,974
Son of a bitch!

1655
01:46:00,385 --> 01:46:01,385
Help!

1656
01:46:05,523 --> 01:46:06,523
Help!

1657
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:09,061
Help!

1658
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:37,039
I should go back there.
I just fucking

1659
01:46:37,139 --> 01:46:39,255
left them in the lurch, man.
I should go back there.

1660
01:46:39,356 --> 01:46:41,273
What the fuck are you talking about?
Fuck that.

1661
01:46:41,372 --> 01:46:42,372
Fuck them.

1662
01:46:43,527 --> 01:46:46,131
I got dates
in fucking Reno, man.

1663
01:46:55,474 --> 01:46:57,192
Reflecting
on the meaning of

1664
01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:58,559
what I just read,

1665
01:46:58,660 --> 01:47:00,996
the word "Leshanot"
comes up a lot,

1666
01:47:01,097 --> 01:47:04,017
which means "to
change, to transform."

1667
01:47:04,916 --> 01:47:06,969
Which makes sense,
I guess,

1668
01:47:07,068 --> 01:47:09,822
because today I'm
supposed to become a man.

1669
01:47:12,924 --> 01:47:15,244
It's funny, though.

1670
01:47:15,344 --> 01:47:18,647
Everyone, I think,
has some memories

1671
01:47:18,746 --> 01:47:20,599
they're prouder of
than others, right?

1672
01:47:22,367 --> 01:47:25,804
And maybe that's why
change is so scary.

1673
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:30,242
'Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind

1674
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:34,095
Good morning, Mike.
How you doing?

1675
01:47:34,196 --> 01:47:36,064
the whispers we wish
we could silence

1676
01:47:36,165 --> 01:47:39,619
His pa is the one.
The one that set that fire.

1677
01:47:41,687 --> 01:47:44,956
the nightmares we most
want to wake up from,

1678
01:47:47,393 --> 01:47:50,295
the memories we wish
we could change

1679
01:47:54,866 --> 01:47:57,836
the secrets we feel
like we have to keep

1680
01:47:59,906 --> 01:48:02,674
are the hardest to
walk away from.

1681
01:48:06,545 --> 01:48:09,064
The good stuff?

1682
01:48:09,165 --> 01:48:13,335
The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest?

1683
01:48:13,434 --> 01:48:17,023
Those pieces of you it
feels the easiest to lose.

1684
01:48:18,723 --> 01:48:21,760
Maybe I don't want to forget.

1685
01:48:23,795 --> 01:48:27,099
Maybe if that's what
today is all about,

1686
01:48:29,367 --> 01:48:31,253
forget it, right?

1687
01:48:31,353 --> 01:48:32,955
Thank you, Stanley.

1688
01:48:33,054 --> 01:48:34,689
Today, I'm supposed
to become a man,

1689
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:37,777
but I don't feel
any different.

1690
01:48:39,745 --> 01:48:41,831
I know I'm a loser.

1691
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:44,099
And no matter what,

1692
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,119
I always fucking will be.

1693
01:49:06,505 --> 01:49:08,374
Thanks for showing up,
Stanley.

1694
01:49:49,915 --> 01:49:52,116
Mike! Help!

1695
01:49:54,085 --> 01:49:55,237
Help us!

1696
01:49:55,336 --> 01:49:58,506
Please, Mikey, get help!
Help us!

1697
01:49:58,607 --> 01:50:01,643
Please, Mikey,
get help!

1698
01:50:01,744 --> 01:50:02,943
Mikey!

1699
01:50:28,353 --> 01:50:31,156
You should
have burned, Mike.

1700
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:39,214
Just like
your druggie parents.

1701
01:50:39,314 --> 01:50:42,017
Can you see them yet?

1702
01:50:42,116 --> 01:50:43,436
Crisping?

1703
01:50:45,004 --> 01:50:47,173
Like fried fucking

1704
01:50:59,184 --> 01:51:01,836
I guess you could say
that was long overdue.

1705
01:51:01,937 --> 01:51:03,738
Get it?
'Cause we're in a library.

1706
01:51:03,839 --> 01:51:04,839
No.

1707
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,660
Oh

1708
01:51:10,362 --> 01:51:11,362
Mike?

1709
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,866
Hey.
Hey. Oh, my God.

1710
01:51:19,905 --> 01:51:21,490
Are you all right?

1711
01:51:21,589 --> 01:51:23,670
No, I'm not all right.
I just fucking killed a guy.

1712
01:51:24,442 --> 01:51:25,945
I was talking to Mike.

1713
01:51:28,014 --> 01:51:29,514
Where's Bill?

1714
01:51:35,187 --> 01:51:36,505
Bill, we're all
at the library.

1715
01:51:36,604 --> 01:51:38,006
Where are you at?

1716
01:51:38,107 --> 01:51:40,308
He took a little
kid, Mike.

1717
01:51:40,408 --> 01:51:43,946
He took a little kid right
in fucking front of me.

1718
01:51:44,045 --> 01:51:45,781
No, no, no, no, no.
Just, just

1719
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,358
Look, just come here
to the library.

1720
01:51:47,459 --> 01:51:48,783
We can talk about
the plan.

1721
01:51:48,884 --> 01:51:50,952
I'm gonna go kill It.
No, no, no.

1722
01:51:51,053 --> 01:51:54,822
I don't want any of you
to get killed with me.

1723
01:51:54,923 --> 01:51:56,274
Bill! Bill!

1724
01:52:01,046 --> 01:52:02,665
He's going
to fight It alone.

1725
01:52:02,765 --> 01:52:05,099
What?
Alone.

1726
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:06,434
It's about the group.

1727
01:52:06,535 --> 01:52:08,251
The ritual doesn't work
without the group.

1728
01:52:08,352 --> 01:52:09,790
Doing it together
is why it'd work.

1729
01:52:13,526 --> 01:52:15,943
Mike, did he tell you
where he was going?

1730
01:52:16,044 --> 01:52:17,845
If he really wanted
to kill Pennywise,

1731
01:52:17,946 --> 01:52:19,447
there's only one place
he'll go.

1732
01:52:19,548 --> 01:52:21,505
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

1733
01:52:21,606 --> 01:52:23,902
Oh, we're not gonna like
this, are we?

1734
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:25,870
Fuck.

1735
01:52:55,801 --> 01:52:56,801
Bill!

1736
01:52:57,754 --> 01:52:59,755
No, no,
you guys, no!

1737
01:52:59,856 --> 01:53:01,823
I started all this.

1738
01:53:01,924 --> 01:53:04,661
It's my fault that
you're all here.

1739
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,162
This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside you all.

1740
01:53:08,263 --> 01:53:10,198
It started growing
the day

1741
01:53:10,299 --> 01:53:11,857
that I made you go
down to the Barrens

1742
01:53:11,956 --> 01:53:16,522
because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

1743
01:53:17,956 --> 01:53:19,407
Now, I'm gonna
go in there,

1744
01:53:19,508 --> 01:53:21,143
and I don't know
what's gonna happen,

1745
01:53:21,242 --> 01:53:24,028
but I can't ask you
to do this.

1746
01:53:26,098 --> 01:53:27,098
Well,

1747
01:53:27,515 --> 01:53:29,652
we're not asking you,
either.

1748
01:53:29,751 --> 01:53:30,754
Bev
We didn't

1749
01:53:30,853 --> 01:53:32,353
do it alone
then, Bill,

1750
01:53:32,454 --> 01:53:35,057
so we're not gonna
do this alone now.

1751
01:53:35,156 --> 01:53:37,375
Losers stick together.

1752
01:53:42,947 --> 01:53:45,619
So, does somebody
want to say something?

1753
01:53:47,452 --> 01:53:50,572
Richie said it best
when we were here last.

1754
01:53:50,673 --> 01:53:51,872
I did?

1755
01:53:53,591 --> 01:53:56,378
"I don't want to die"?
Not that.

1756
01:53:56,478 --> 01:53:58,229
"You're lucky we're
not measuring dicks"?

1757
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:00,698
No.

1758
01:54:03,234 --> 01:54:04,670
"Let's kill
this fucking clown"?

1759
01:54:08,607 --> 01:54:11,277
Let's kill this
fucking clown.

1760
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,100
Hmm.

1761
01:54:37,652 --> 01:54:39,412
Well, I love what he's
done with the place.

1762
01:54:39,972 --> 01:54:41,089
Beep-beep, Richie.

1763
01:54:41,188 --> 01:54:42,441
All right.

1764
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,562
Hey, hey.
That's the basement, right?

1765
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:10,535
Ben?

1766
01:55:11,353 --> 01:55:13,555
No, no!
Hey, hey! Ben!

1767
01:55:13,656 --> 01:55:14,656
Ben!

1768
01:55:14,823 --> 01:55:15,823
Ben? What's wrong?

1769
01:55:18,143 --> 01:55:20,329
Ben!
Okay. All right.

1770
01:55:20,429 --> 01:55:21,429
Ben!

1771
01:55:28,187 --> 01:55:30,188
Okay, that can't
be good, right?

1772
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:33,358
Help! Hey!

1773
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Ugh!

1774
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:49,073
It's Stan.

1775
01:55:52,845 --> 01:55:54,045
It can't
be real.

1776
01:55:55,682 --> 01:55:56,682
Oh!

1777
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:00,670
Oh, God.

1778
01:56:00,769 --> 01:56:01,769
Shit.

1779
01:56:10,062 --> 01:56:12,497
I'd still be alive if
it wasn't for you, Bill.

1780
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:14,633
No.

1781
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:20,371
Beverly!

1782
01:56:42,294 --> 01:56:44,496
Richie, what's happening to me?

1783
01:57:04,316 --> 01:57:06,885
You gotta be
fucking kidding.

1784
01:57:12,191 --> 01:57:13,191
Fuck!

1785
01:57:15,929 --> 01:57:19,298
Oh, God damn it, get it away from me.
Oh, God!

1786
01:57:22,267 --> 01:57:24,303
Whoa, whoa!

1787
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:36,098
Eddie.

1788
01:57:36,197 --> 01:57:38,317
Hey. Are you okay?

1789
01:57:38,817 --> 01:57:39,818
I'm

1790
01:57:45,024 --> 01:57:46,258
Oh, there he is.

1791
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:51,196
Get it off of me!

1792
01:57:52,264 --> 01:57:53,866
Get it off of me!

1793
01:57:55,835 --> 01:57:56,835
Richie!

1794
01:57:56,933 --> 01:57:59,139
Richie!
Richie! Hey!

1795
01:58:01,808 --> 01:58:03,474
Get it off of me!
I wanna go home.

1796
01:58:05,045 --> 01:58:06,528
Get the knife!

1797
01:58:06,629 --> 01:58:08,362
God damn it, Eddie,
get the knife!

1798
01:58:08,463 --> 01:58:10,950
Bill! Get it off of me, Bill!
Quick!

1799
01:58:13,451 --> 01:58:15,219
Eddie, get the knife!

1800
01:58:15,854 --> 01:58:17,423
Ahh! Fuck!

1801
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:39,112
What?

1802
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:52,774
Is everybody okay?

1803
01:58:52,875 --> 01:58:55,644
You all right?

1804
01:58:55,745 --> 01:58:58,014
He could have
fucking died, man.

1805
01:58:58,113 --> 01:58:59,214
You know that, right?

1806
01:58:59,313 --> 01:59:00,849
I can't see.

1807
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:04,553
Georgie's dead. The kid's dead.
Stanley's dead.

1808
01:59:04,652 --> 01:59:07,156
You want Richie, too?
You want Richie, too?

1809
01:59:07,255 --> 01:59:09,508
I don't want Richie, too.
I don't. I don't.

1810
01:59:14,246 --> 01:59:16,247
Please don't
be mad, Bill.

1811
01:59:20,152 --> 01:59:22,021
I was just scared.

1812
01:59:24,523 --> 01:59:27,459
That's what
he wants, right?

1813
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:31,865
Don't give it to him.

1814
01:59:44,408 --> 01:59:46,012
A lot of memories, huh?

1815
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:49,581
All bad.

1816
02:00:02,294 --> 02:00:03,528
Oh, man.

1817
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,000
Blech. Gray water.

1818
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:46,738
Shit. This is it.

1819
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:49,942
This is where
it happened.

1820
02:01:05,825 --> 02:01:07,375
No, no, no.

1821
02:01:07,474 --> 02:01:09,027
No. Ugh!

1822
02:01:17,603 --> 02:01:18,905
Bevvie.

1823
02:01:28,313 --> 02:01:29,514
Bev, what is it?

1824
02:01:34,754 --> 02:01:36,356
I thought
I heard something.

1825
02:01:38,892 --> 02:01:39,892
Bev!

1826
02:01:40,343 --> 02:01:41,693
Time to sink!

1827
02:01:45,397 --> 02:01:46,397
Bev!

1828
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:49,701
Guys.

1829
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:54,807
Okay, guys.
Come on.

1830
02:01:59,278 --> 02:02:01,030
Hey, guys.

1831
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:03,198
Guys, come on.
Please, come on.

1832
02:02:03,299 --> 02:02:05,084
I don't want to walk
out of here alone.

1833
02:02:08,921 --> 02:02:10,639
You okay?

1834
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,908
I feel like crying.

1835
02:02:13,009 --> 02:02:15,795
Mike. Where do we go from here?

1836
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:24,553
In the depths
is where It crept.

1837
02:02:24,652 --> 02:02:26,420
In the beneath,
to find belief.

1838
02:02:26,521 --> 02:02:27,839
In the depths
is where It crept.

1839
02:02:27,938 --> 02:02:29,325
In the beneath,
to find belief.

1840
02:02:29,424 --> 02:02:30,859
Is he okay?

1841
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,996
I think at this point,
that's a relative question.

1842
02:02:33,095 --> 02:02:34,630
What's on
the other side?

1843
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:37,082
I don't know.
No one does.

1844
02:02:39,919 --> 02:02:41,120
Whoa,
whoa, whoa!

1845
02:02:41,955 --> 02:02:42,956
Mike.

1846
02:02:48,061 --> 02:02:50,079
Mike, don't.
All right.

1847
02:02:50,179 --> 02:02:51,446
See you down there.
Mike!

1848
02:02:51,545 --> 02:02:52,545
Wait!

1849
02:02:58,938 --> 02:03:01,206
Stay together.
Okay.

1850
02:03:04,309 --> 02:03:05,544
You guys,
I can't do it.

1851
02:03:07,647 --> 02:03:09,764
I can't.
You saw what happened up there.

1852
02:03:09,865 --> 02:03:11,901
I was gonna
let you die.

1853
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,869
I just fucking
froze up.

1854
02:03:13,969 --> 02:03:15,972
If you let me go
down there with you,

1855
02:03:16,072 --> 02:03:17,572
I'm gonna get us all killed.

1856
02:03:17,673 --> 02:03:18,831
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

1857
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:19,969
Give me that.
Richie.

1858
02:03:20,068 --> 02:03:21,509
Let go,
you little turd.

1859
02:03:21,608 --> 02:03:23,362
Just let me get

1860
02:03:24,764 --> 02:03:25,964
I got it.
Stop.

1861
02:03:26,698 --> 02:03:28,216
Listen to me.

1862
02:03:28,317 --> 02:03:29,852
You had a moment.
Fine.

1863
02:03:29,951 --> 02:03:32,738
But who killed a psychotic
clown before he was 14?

1864
02:03:34,273 --> 02:03:35,273
Me.

1865
02:03:35,491 --> 02:03:36,768
Who stabbed Bowers
with a knife

1866
02:03:36,869 --> 02:03:38,107
he pulled out
of his own face?

1867
02:03:38,206 --> 02:03:39,206
Also me.

1868
02:03:39,305 --> 02:03:41,224
Who married a woman 10
times his own body mass?

1869
02:03:43,548 --> 02:03:45,151
Me.
Yeah.

1870
02:03:48,187 --> 02:03:50,572
You're braver
than you think.

1871
02:03:50,671 --> 02:03:51,857
All right.
Thanks, Rich.

1872
02:03:52,791 --> 02:03:54,826
Ow.
Sorry.

1873
02:03:57,330 --> 02:03:58,447
Hey.
Here.

1874
02:03:58,546 --> 02:03:59,581
Take it.

1875
02:03:59,682 --> 02:04:01,566
It kills monsters.

1876
02:04:03,567 --> 02:04:05,787
Does it?
Yeah.

1877
02:04:05,888 --> 02:04:07,539
If you believe
it does.

1878
02:04:09,107 --> 02:04:10,175
Thanks, Bev.

1879
02:04:28,393 --> 02:04:29,512
You guys good?

1880
02:04:29,612 --> 02:04:30,612
Yeah.

1881
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:36,484
Can you get through that?

1882
02:04:36,585 --> 02:04:37,742
It's the only way.
This way.

1883
02:04:37,843 --> 02:04:39,237
It's in here!

1884
02:04:43,175 --> 02:04:44,292
Through here.

1885
02:04:44,393 --> 02:04:46,278
It's tight,
but we can get through.

1886
02:05:01,827 --> 02:05:03,696
This is where It hid.

1887
02:05:24,282 --> 02:05:28,603
So, all this has been under
Derry, like, forever?

1888
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,505
Not forever.

1889
02:05:30,606 --> 02:05:32,023
Just a few million years.

1890
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:11,045
It can only be
attacked in its true form.

1891
02:06:11,146 --> 02:06:12,344
The ritual
will show us that.

1892
02:06:12,443 --> 02:06:13,883
And what is
It's true form?

1893
02:06:13,982 --> 02:06:15,783
I hope it's a puppy.

1894
02:06:15,884 --> 02:06:18,153
Like a Pomeranian or

1895
02:06:18,254 --> 02:06:19,254
I'll shut up.

1896
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:21,273
It's light.

1897
02:06:25,111 --> 02:06:27,179
A light that must be
snuffed out by darkness.

1898
02:06:40,358 --> 02:06:41,359
Your artifacts.

1899
02:06:42,961 --> 02:06:45,113
Place them in the fire.

1900
02:06:45,214 --> 02:06:47,265
The past must
burn with the present.

1901
02:06:55,707 --> 02:06:58,978
This is the boat
that I built

1902
02:07:01,414 --> 02:07:02,915
with Georgie.

1903
02:07:07,519 --> 02:07:09,789
It's my inhaler.

1904
02:07:15,027 --> 02:07:16,195
Come on, dude.

1905
02:07:18,798 --> 02:07:21,032
Something that
I wish I had held on to.

1906
02:07:26,706 --> 02:07:29,593
This is a page
from my yearbook.

1907
02:07:29,692 --> 02:07:32,260
That only
one person signed.

1908
02:07:32,361 --> 02:07:35,665
I probably should
have forgotten it,

1909
02:07:35,764 --> 02:07:38,216
but I couldn't,
because I kept it in my wallet

1910
02:07:40,018 --> 02:07:41,519
for 27 years.

1911
02:07:47,826 --> 02:07:49,505
This is a token
from the Capitol Theater.

1912
02:07:49,604 --> 02:07:51,362
You brought an actual token?
Yeah, man.

1913
02:07:51,463 --> 02:07:53,259
That's what we were supposed to
do, asshole.

1914
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:55,635
Do you have any idea how long
that's gonna take to burn?

1915
02:07:55,736 --> 02:07:57,174
Yeah, but so is your
inhaler, dude.

1916
02:07:57,273 --> 02:07:58,273
Guys, come on.

1917
02:07:58,372 --> 02:08:00,451
All the toxic fumes and
the plastic and shit, so

1918
02:08:02,474 --> 02:08:03,475
Look closely, Bev.

1919
02:08:04,943 --> 02:08:06,829
You see it?

1920
02:08:06,929 --> 02:08:08,347
That's where
you hit Bowers.

1921
02:08:10,348 --> 02:08:11,349
The rock fight.

1922
02:08:13,853 --> 02:08:15,787
The day these bonds were forged.

1923
02:08:16,756 --> 02:08:18,256
That's not
gonna burn, either.

1924
02:08:23,795 --> 02:08:24,996
Oh, wait.

1925
02:08:28,401 --> 02:08:29,902
Couldn't forget
about Stan,

1926
02:08:30,637 --> 02:08:31,836
again.

1927
02:08:36,875 --> 02:08:37,875
Okay.

1928
02:08:38,594 --> 02:08:39,594
Grab hands.

1929
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:42,314
Come on.

1930
02:08:49,921 --> 02:08:52,006
The Ritual of Chud.

1931
02:08:52,107 --> 02:08:54,876
It's a battle of wills.

1932
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:57,412
The first step
was our reunion.

1933
02:08:57,513 --> 02:09:01,299
The second was
the gathering of tokens.

1934
02:09:03,169 --> 02:09:05,204
This is the final step.

1935
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,241
What the

1936
02:09:17,982 --> 02:09:19,602
Fuck is that?

1937
02:09:19,701 --> 02:09:21,059
Don't look at them!
Are those

1938
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,738
the Deadlights?
Don't look at it!

1939
02:09:22,839 --> 02:09:23,839
Okay.

1940
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:26,616
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark. Say it!

1941
02:09:26,715 --> 02:09:27,826
Say what?
Say it!

1942
02:09:27,926 --> 02:09:29,362
Turn light
into dark.

1943
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:32,947
Turn light into dark.

1944
02:09:33,048 --> 02:09:34,517
Turn light
into dark.

1945
02:09:34,616 --> 02:09:36,234
Turn light
into dark.

1946
02:09:37,838 --> 02:09:40,106
Turn light into dark.

1947
02:09:52,686 --> 02:09:55,036
Turn light into dark.
Mike, what's happening, man?

1948
02:09:55,137 --> 02:09:56,740
Keep chanting!

1949
02:09:56,839 --> 02:09:58,023
Turn light
into dark.

1950
02:10:01,192 --> 02:10:03,646
Turn light
into dark!

1951
02:10:03,746 --> 02:10:05,581
Turn light
into dark!

1952
02:10:05,682 --> 02:10:08,384
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1953
02:10:08,483 --> 02:10:10,121
Keep chanting!
Turn light into dark!

1954
02:10:10,220 --> 02:10:11,858
Keep chanting!
Turn light into dark!

1955
02:10:15,776 --> 02:10:17,693
Turn light into dark!
Turn light into dark!

1956
02:10:17,794 --> 02:10:18,954
Is it working?
Did we do it?

1957
02:10:22,548 --> 02:10:23,965
What is this?
Is this part of it?

1958
02:10:24,066 --> 02:10:25,662
Mike, is this supposed
to be happening?

1959
02:10:25,763 --> 02:10:27,241
What? No, no, no.
Keep chanting!

1960
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:28,340
What?
Keep chanting!

1961
02:10:28,439 --> 02:10:29,706
Turn light
into dark!

1962
02:10:29,805 --> 02:10:31,240
Turn light into dark.
Come on!

1963
02:10:31,339 --> 02:10:33,908
Turn light into dark.
Turn light into dark.

1964
02:10:34,009 --> 02:10:35,009
Whoa!

1965
02:10:39,765 --> 02:10:41,066
Hey! Hey!

1966
02:10:45,537 --> 02:10:46,537
Shit!

1967
02:10:49,375 --> 02:10:52,411
Move, move!
Whoa!

1968
02:11:00,585 --> 02:11:02,385
Bev. Bev.

1969
02:11:03,656 --> 02:11:06,174
Richie.
Are you okay?

1970
02:11:06,274 --> 02:11:07,710
I can't hear shit.
He's okay.

1971
02:11:07,809 --> 02:11:09,447
Are you all right?
Yeah. No, no, no.

1972
02:11:09,546 --> 02:11:10,912
Wait, where's Mike?
Mike!

1973
02:11:11,013 --> 02:11:12,013
Mike!

1974
02:11:12,281 --> 02:11:14,249
I'm here!
Hey, guys.

1975
02:11:14,348 --> 02:11:16,317
Did we do it? Did we do it?
Yeah? Did we do it?

1976
02:11:16,417 --> 02:11:17,952
We put the
tokens in the thing.

1977
02:11:18,053 --> 02:11:19,086
That's good, right?

1978
02:11:19,187 --> 02:11:20,941
We did it, right?

1979
02:11:22,942 --> 02:11:24,358
Shit! Shit!

1980
02:11:24,459 --> 02:11:27,513
Oh, did it work, Mikey?
Did it work?

1981
02:11:29,581 --> 02:11:33,117
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

1982
02:11:34,353 --> 02:11:36,103
Tell them
it's all just a

1983
02:11:36,204 --> 02:11:37,973
What's the word, Eds?

1984
02:11:38,072 --> 02:11:39,325
Gazebo?

1985
02:11:40,593 --> 02:11:42,210
Mike, what's
he talking about?

1986
02:11:42,311 --> 02:11:43,461
Mikey?

1987
02:11:44,996 --> 02:11:49,768
Oh, Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, did you?

1988
02:11:51,303 --> 02:11:52,722
Didn't want them to know

1989
02:11:52,822 --> 02:11:55,724
what actually happened to
the poor Shokopiwah?

1990
02:11:55,825 --> 02:11:58,076
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1991
02:12:06,585 --> 02:12:08,838
Fuck, Mikey.
You lied to us, again?

1992
02:12:08,938 --> 02:12:12,040
No,
but they didn't believe!

1993
02:12:12,139 --> 02:12:13,737
They didn't believe
they could kill It!

1994
02:12:13,838 --> 02:12:15,316
That's why it didn't
work back then!

1995
02:12:15,415 --> 02:12:16,773
Are you fucking kidding
me, Mike?

1996
02:12:16,874 --> 02:12:17,874
We hurt him.
Fuck!

1997
02:12:17,973 --> 02:12:19,281
Fuck you, Mikey.

1998
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:22,384
I needed something,
anything, for us to remember.

1999
02:12:22,483 --> 02:12:23,952
Anything for us
to believe!

2000
02:12:24,053 --> 02:12:25,137
God damn it!
Fuck!

2001
02:12:34,146 --> 02:12:35,197
The Deadlights!

2002
02:12:35,296 --> 02:12:36,649
Don't look at them!

2003
02:12:41,688 --> 02:12:43,289
For 27 years,

2004
02:12:44,223 --> 02:12:47,423
I dreamt of you.

2005
02:12:48,929 --> 02:12:51,213
I craved you.

2006
02:12:51,313 --> 02:12:53,883
Oh, I've
missed you!

2007
02:12:53,982 --> 02:12:55,884
Mike! Move back!

2008
02:12:55,984 --> 02:13:00,054
Waiting for
this very moment.

2009
02:13:00,155 --> 02:13:02,625
Mikey!
You gotta move, Mikey!

2010
02:13:02,724 --> 02:13:04,643
Sorry. I'm sorry, guys.
Mike, come on, man!

2011
02:13:04,742 --> 02:13:05,862
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

2012
02:13:05,961 --> 02:13:08,347
Time to float!

2013
02:13:10,951 --> 02:13:12,483
Oh, shit!
Sorry.

2014
02:13:14,653 --> 02:13:16,338
Mike, come on, get up!
Get him up!

2015
02:13:16,438 --> 02:13:18,240
Go, go!
Run!

2016
02:13:18,339 --> 02:13:20,660
Oh, shit!
Run! Go, go, go!

2017
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:32,403
Go, go, go!

2018
02:13:36,609 --> 02:13:37,609
Go!

2019
02:13:50,857 --> 02:13:52,357
Go, go, go!

2020
02:13:56,696 --> 02:13:57,696
Where'd he go?

2021
02:13:57,795 --> 02:13:59,195
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out.

2022
02:14:20,585 --> 02:14:22,220
Oh, shit!
Can he see us?

2023
02:14:23,255 --> 02:14:24,573
Oh, my God!

2024
02:14:24,674 --> 02:14:25,674
Shit.

2025
02:14:26,524 --> 02:14:28,175
Oh, shit.

2026
02:14:28,276 --> 02:14:30,344
Holy shit!
Holy shit! Run!

2027
02:14:30,445 --> 02:14:31,930
Oh, shit!

2028
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:35,200
Shit.
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

2029
02:14:41,372 --> 02:14:42,558
We're trapped.

2030
02:14:42,657 --> 02:14:44,410
Where do we go?

2031
02:15:13,405 --> 02:15:15,389
God damn it!
Uh

2032
02:15:15,490 --> 02:15:17,660
All right.
"Not Scary At All." All right?

2033
02:15:17,759 --> 02:15:18,759
No, no, no.

2034
02:15:18,858 --> 02:15:20,327
Wait. Why?

2035
02:15:20,428 --> 02:15:22,164
They're flipped.
He's fucking with us.

2036
02:15:22,264 --> 02:15:24,398
Are you sure? Positive?
Trust me.

2037
02:15:24,499 --> 02:15:25,785
Yes!
Okay.

2038
02:15:30,389 --> 02:15:31,624
Where's my shoe?

2039
02:15:44,503 --> 02:15:46,805
What the fuck?
You told me to trust you!

2040
02:15:49,142 --> 02:15:50,291
He's not
fucking with us.

2041
02:15:50,392 --> 02:15:51,670
Let's go to
"Not Scary At All."

2042
02:15:51,769 --> 02:15:52,769
Okay.

2043
02:15:58,785 --> 02:16:00,786
It's all right.
Let's go.

2044
02:16:03,055 --> 02:16:04,691
Oh, shit.

2045
02:16:06,859 --> 02:16:08,643
No way am I falling
for this shit again.

2046
02:16:08,744 --> 02:16:11,147
Oh, yeah.
That thing's a fucking monster.

2047
02:16:11,246 --> 02:16:12,447
Richie, make it sit.

2048
02:16:12,546 --> 02:16:15,033
I know your moves,
you little bitch.

2049
02:16:17,670 --> 02:16:18,670
Rich?

2050
02:16:19,371 --> 02:16:20,689
It's gone, man.

2051
02:16:20,790 --> 02:16:22,157
Yeah. Wait.
Oh. Okay.

2052
02:16:22,258 --> 02:16:23,258
Okay.

2053
02:16:25,010 --> 02:16:26,010
Sit.

2054
02:16:27,179 --> 02:16:28,664
He did it.

2055
02:16:28,764 --> 02:16:30,098
Oh, that's cute.

2056
02:16:30,198 --> 02:16:32,236
That's a good boy.
That's actually super cute.

2057
02:16:32,335 --> 02:16:33,335
That's a good boy.

2058
02:16:33,434 --> 02:16:34,794
Are you a good boy?
Good boy.

2059
02:16:39,758 --> 02:16:40,758
Shit!

2060
02:16:41,109 --> 02:16:43,027
Yo, next time,
we just go with regular "Scary."

2061
02:16:43,128 --> 02:16:44,396
Next time?

2062
02:16:56,909 --> 02:16:59,879
I lost it,
Billy.

2063
02:17:01,648 --> 02:17:03,917
It just floated off.

2064
02:17:06,585 --> 02:17:09,354
I'm not mad at you.

2065
02:17:10,757 --> 02:17:13,491
It's your fault what
happened, isn't it?

2066
02:17:15,828 --> 02:17:19,865
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

2067
02:17:21,233 --> 02:17:22,233
No.

2068
02:17:24,369 --> 02:17:27,355
I just pretended

2069
02:17:27,454 --> 02:17:29,843
because I didn't want to
play with you.

2070
02:17:33,278 --> 02:17:35,114
I just didn't want to.

2071
02:17:36,316 --> 02:17:38,918
You lied and I died.

2072
02:17:39,685 --> 02:17:43,272
You lied and I died.

2073
02:17:43,372 --> 02:17:46,308
You lied and I died!

2074
02:17:46,408 --> 02:17:49,177
You lied and I died!

2075
02:17:49,277 --> 02:17:51,147
You lied and I died!

2076
02:17:51,247 --> 02:17:53,480
It happened because of
me, Georgie. Me.

2077
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:55,068
No, no, no.
It was

2078
02:18:03,275 --> 02:18:04,326
Lied and died!

2079
02:18:04,426 --> 02:18:06,294
Lied and died!

2080
02:18:06,394 --> 02:18:08,130
Lied and died!

2081
02:18:08,230 --> 02:18:10,283
You lied and I died!

2082
02:18:42,649 --> 02:18:45,568
You in there, you little shit?
I can smell you.

2083
02:18:45,668 --> 02:18:48,087
You smell
just like Lois Lane.

2084
02:18:49,122 --> 02:18:50,290
Here's Johnny!

2085
02:19:30,495 --> 02:19:32,148
All that success,

2086
02:19:32,248 --> 02:19:33,615
all those sit-ups,

2087
02:19:33,715 --> 02:19:35,516
but deep down,
still just

2088
02:19:35,616 --> 02:19:38,536
a little fat, fat,
fatty loser

2089
02:19:39,972 --> 02:19:43,575
who always knew
he would die alone.

2090
02:19:50,215 --> 02:19:52,352
Slut!
Bev!

2091
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:56,554
Beverly!

2092
02:19:57,156 --> 02:19:58,555
Bevvie.

2093
02:19:58,674 --> 02:20:01,443
Just open up the door for
me, okay?

2094
02:20:01,543 --> 02:20:03,462
Beverly,
can you hear me?

2095
02:20:05,197 --> 02:20:07,481
Come to Daddy, now.

2096
02:20:07,581 --> 02:20:08,835
Bev, don't listen!

2097
02:20:10,534 --> 02:20:11,534
Bev!

2098
02:20:12,971 --> 02:20:14,973
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2099
02:20:16,809 --> 02:20:18,643
Beverly, I love you!

2100
02:20:19,612 --> 02:20:20,612
Ben!

2101
02:20:20,962 --> 02:20:23,331
Are you still
my little girl, Bevvie?

2102
02:20:23,432 --> 02:20:25,266
Are you still
my little girl?

2103
02:20:25,366 --> 02:20:26,385
Not anymore!

2104
02:20:29,553 --> 02:20:31,572
You little

2105
02:20:31,673 --> 02:20:33,558
"Your hair
is winter fire.

2106
02:20:35,027 --> 02:20:37,178
"January embers.

2107
02:20:37,278 --> 02:20:39,064
"My heart

2108
02:20:42,068 --> 02:20:43,102
"My heart"

2109
02:20:45,138 --> 02:20:46,138
No!

2110
02:20:52,543 --> 02:20:53,543
Ben!

2111
02:20:53,896 --> 02:20:54,896
Ben!

2112
02:21:18,371 --> 02:21:19,671
"January embers."

2113
02:21:21,473 --> 02:21:23,309
"My heart
burns there, too."

2114
02:21:25,177 --> 02:21:26,646
It was you.

2115
02:21:41,593 --> 02:21:43,178
We deserve to die.

2116
02:21:43,278 --> 02:21:44,278
No.

2117
02:21:44,812 --> 02:21:48,918
You were the best big brother
there ever was.

2118
02:21:49,017 --> 02:21:51,771
No! We killed
our little brother!

2119
02:21:53,305 --> 02:21:55,057
He loved you.

2120
02:21:55,157 --> 02:21:56,793
And just because
you didn't want to play

2121
02:21:56,893 --> 02:21:58,111
on a rainy day,

2122
02:21:59,277 --> 02:22:00,946
just one time,

2123
02:22:03,316 --> 02:22:05,318
that does not
make it our fault.

2124
02:22:16,795 --> 02:22:18,296
And it never,

2125
02:22:21,033 --> 02:22:22,433
ever

2126
02:22:25,371 --> 02:22:26,372
did.

2127
02:23:00,673 --> 02:23:01,673
Bill.

2128
02:23:03,442 --> 02:23:04,776
Miss me?

2129
02:23:06,278 --> 02:23:08,030
I know what you are.

2130
02:23:08,130 --> 02:23:09,415
That's why
I'm not afraid.

2131
02:23:16,054 --> 02:23:18,223
Well, I know
what you are.

2132
02:23:20,293 --> 02:23:21,827
A madman.

2133
02:23:28,301 --> 02:23:29,302
Hey, fuckface!

2134
02:23:36,275 --> 02:23:37,927
You wanna play
Truth or Dare?

2135
02:23:38,026 --> 02:23:39,260
Here's a truth.

2136
02:23:39,361 --> 02:23:40,929
You're a sloppy bitch!

2137
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:42,096
Yeah, that's right!

2138
02:23:42,196 --> 02:23:44,749
Let's dance!
Yippee-ki-yay

2139
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:20,219
This kills monsters.

2140
02:24:21,087 --> 02:24:23,071
If you believe it does.

2141
02:24:23,171 --> 02:24:24,956
If you believe it does.

2142
02:24:25,757 --> 02:24:27,259
If you believe it does.

2143
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:29,862
If you believe it does.

2144
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:34,900
Beep-beep,
motherfucker!

2145
02:24:53,686 --> 02:24:54,755
Holy shit!

2146
02:24:59,292 --> 02:25:00,292
Rich!

2147
02:25:00,475 --> 02:25:01,810
Oh, Rich!

2148
02:25:01,909 --> 02:25:03,513
Hey, Rich,
wake up!

2149
02:25:03,613 --> 02:25:04,613
Hey.

2150
02:25:04,946 --> 02:25:06,481
Yeah, yeah! There he is, buddy!

2151
02:25:06,581 --> 02:25:07,982
Hey, Richie, listen!

2152
02:25:08,082 --> 02:25:09,401
I think
I got him, man!

2153
02:25:11,738 --> 02:25:13,054
I think I killed It!

2154
02:25:13,155 --> 02:25:14,641
I did! I think
I killed It for real!

2155
02:25:19,544 --> 02:25:20,545
Eddie.

2156
02:25:23,316 --> 02:25:24,317
Richie.

2157
02:25:27,519 --> 02:25:28,622
Richie.

2158
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:34,491
No!

2159
02:25:35,828 --> 02:25:37,027
Eddie.

2160
02:25:38,531 --> 02:25:39,730
Uh-oh!

2161
02:25:42,534 --> 02:25:43,534
No!

2162
02:25:56,783 --> 02:25:57,982
Eddie!

2163
02:26:04,623 --> 02:26:05,623
Eds!

2164
02:26:06,759 --> 02:26:08,944
Eds! Eds!
Eddie!

2165
02:26:09,043 --> 02:26:10,496
Eds,
come on, man.

2166
02:26:12,063 --> 02:26:13,265
Be careful!
Be careful!

2167
02:26:23,909 --> 02:26:26,245
Come out
and play, Losers!

2168
02:26:27,748 --> 02:26:29,197
He's hurt.
He's hurt really bad.

2169
02:26:29,298 --> 02:26:30,566
We gotta
get him out of here.

2170
02:26:30,666 --> 02:26:32,266
How are we supposed
to do that, Richie?

2171
02:26:35,888 --> 02:26:37,489
I almost killed It.

2172
02:26:38,792 --> 02:26:39,991
The leper.

2173
02:26:40,892 --> 02:26:43,044
My hands
around his throat.

2174
02:26:43,144 --> 02:26:45,330
And I could feel
him choking.

2175
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:48,500
I made him small.

2176
02:26:53,839 --> 02:26:55,073
He seemed so weak.

2177
02:26:57,909 --> 02:26:59,512
He seemed so weak.

2178
02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:01,514
The Shokopiwah.

2179
02:27:03,149 --> 02:27:04,433
All living things
must abide by

2180
02:27:04,533 --> 02:27:06,017
the laws of the shape
they inhabit.

2181
02:27:07,018 --> 02:27:08,018
Guys!

2182
02:27:08,638 --> 02:27:10,689
There's a passageway.
Through here.

2183
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:14,076
The tunnel.

2184
02:27:14,176 --> 02:27:16,078
Pennywise has to
make himself small

2185
02:27:16,177 --> 02:27:19,248
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

2186
02:27:19,347 --> 02:27:21,066
Okay, so, if we can get back
there, we can

2187
02:27:21,166 --> 02:27:22,852
force him down to size.
Yeah.

2188
02:27:22,952 --> 02:27:26,138
We make him small.
Small enough so we can kill him.

2189
02:27:28,307 --> 02:27:31,677
I can smell
the stink of your fear!

2190
02:27:33,212 --> 02:27:35,196
Let's go! Go!
Come on! Come on!

2191
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:37,081
It's tight. It's tight.
Be careful!

2192
02:27:51,296 --> 02:27:54,600
I need a little rest.
Oh, thanks.

2193
02:27:55,768 --> 02:27:56,768
Hey.

2194
02:27:57,452 --> 02:27:58,453
Hey, Richie?

2195
02:27:58,553 --> 02:27:59,789
I gotta
tell you something.

2196
02:27:59,889 --> 02:28:01,473
What?
What's up, buddy?

2197
02:28:04,643 --> 02:28:05,644
I fucked your mother.

2198
02:28:10,248 --> 02:28:12,084
Losers out!

2199
02:28:14,888 --> 02:28:16,087
Go. Go!

2200
02:28:27,166 --> 02:28:28,366
Gotcha!

2201
02:28:29,668 --> 02:28:30,668
Whoa!

2202
02:28:31,319 --> 02:28:34,641
You filthy little children.

2203
02:28:36,374 --> 02:28:38,411
You got a plan B, man?
What the hell do we do now?

2204
02:28:38,512 --> 02:28:39,669
You die.
That's what you do.

2205
02:28:40,578 --> 02:28:41,578
Mike?

2206
02:28:44,349 --> 02:28:46,310
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

2207
02:28:48,419 --> 02:28:49,419
Oh!

2208
02:28:49,518 --> 02:28:51,507
Make him
believe that he is.

2209
02:28:51,606 --> 02:28:53,442
What?
Make him believe that he is.

2210
02:28:53,542 --> 02:28:56,542
Oh? Me?
Small?

2211
02:28:58,096 --> 02:29:01,149
I am
the Eater of Worlds.

2212
02:29:01,248 --> 02:29:02,434
Not to us,
you're not.

2213
02:29:05,169 --> 02:29:06,571
You're just a clown.

2214
02:29:11,878 --> 02:29:13,245
You're a weak old woman.

2215
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:18,734
The Eater of Worlds.

2216
02:29:18,835 --> 02:29:20,185
A headless boy!

2217
02:29:22,087 --> 02:29:23,588
Impostor!

2218
02:29:25,057 --> 02:29:26,525
You're a mimic!

2219
02:29:28,794 --> 02:29:30,394
A mimic!

2220
02:29:30,512 --> 02:29:33,314
You're a fucking bully!

2221
02:29:33,415 --> 02:29:35,050
You're just
a fucking clown!

2222
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:36,250
Eater of Worlds!

2223
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:38,370
A clown!
A dumb fucking clown!

2224
02:29:39,571 --> 02:29:40,772
Clown!

2225
02:29:42,841 --> 02:29:44,442
A leper!

2226
02:29:44,961 --> 02:29:46,763
You're a clown!

2227
02:29:46,863 --> 02:29:48,096
You're a clown!

2228
02:29:48,195 --> 02:29:49,298
A painting!

2229
02:29:49,398 --> 02:29:50,667
You're a clown!

2230
02:29:50,766 --> 02:29:52,067
I'm not afraid
of you anymore!

2231
02:29:52,167 --> 02:29:55,004
A motherfucking
stupid mummy!

2232
02:29:55,104 --> 02:29:56,287
You're a clown!

2233
02:29:57,723 --> 02:29:59,558
Clown! Clown!

2234
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:03,679
Clown!
Clown!

2235
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:05,915
You're a fucking clown!

2236
02:30:06,015 --> 02:30:07,348
You're a clown!

2237
02:30:07,448 --> 02:30:09,568
A stupid mummy!
Clown!

2238
02:30:10,936 --> 02:30:12,254
Clown, motherfucker!

2239
02:30:12,354 --> 02:30:15,608
I am the Eater of Worlds!

2240
02:30:20,178 --> 02:30:21,379
Clown!

2241
02:30:22,264 --> 02:30:24,834
Clown!
You're just a clown! Clown!

2242
02:30:24,934 --> 02:30:27,604
I am the Eater of Worlds!
A clown!

2243
02:30:27,703 --> 02:30:28,703
Whoa!

2244
02:30:29,237 --> 02:30:31,322
A clown! A clown!

2245
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:35,712
No one's
afraid of you.

2246
02:30:35,811 --> 02:30:37,229
No one's scared of you.

2247
02:30:38,831 --> 02:30:41,132
Clown! Clown!

2248
02:30:42,133 --> 02:30:45,838
Clown. Clown. Clown.

2249
02:30:48,273 --> 02:30:50,442
Clown.
Clown.

2250
02:30:52,646 --> 02:30:54,246
A clown.

2251
02:30:54,664 --> 02:30:56,683
With a scared,
beating heart.

2252
02:31:44,263 --> 02:31:46,632
Look at you.

2253
02:31:48,034 --> 02:31:52,034
You're all grown up.

2254
02:32:56,236 --> 02:32:57,469
Eddie. Eddie.

2255
02:33:01,141 --> 02:33:03,308
Eddie.
We got Pennywise, man.

2256
02:33:05,409 --> 02:33:06,613
Eddie?

2257
02:33:19,424 --> 02:33:20,626
Richie.

2258
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:22,477
He's gone.

2259
02:33:22,577 --> 02:33:24,015
He's all right.
No, he's just hurt.

2260
02:33:24,114 --> 02:33:26,381
We gotta get him outta here.
He's hurt. Ben.

2261
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:28,318
Bill, he's okay.
We gotta get him outta here.

2262
02:33:28,418 --> 02:33:29,418
Bev.

2263
02:33:29,969 --> 02:33:31,369
Richie.

2264
02:33:34,174 --> 02:33:35,174
What?

2265
02:33:35,557 --> 02:33:37,475
Honey, he's dead.

2266
02:33:40,846 --> 02:33:43,064
We have to go. Come on.
Come on, Richie.

2267
02:33:43,165 --> 02:33:44,700
We gotta go.

2268
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:46,484
Come on, buddy. Come on.

2269
02:33:50,355 --> 02:33:51,573
Let him go, man.
Let him go.

2270
02:33:51,674 --> 02:33:53,073
Got it.

2271
02:33:53,676 --> 02:33:56,394
We can still help him, guys!
We can still help him!

2272
02:33:57,396 --> 02:33:58,546
Go! Go! Get up!

2273
02:33:58,647 --> 02:34:00,834
Guys, we can
still help him!

2274
02:34:12,543 --> 02:34:14,543
No! Eddie!

2275
02:34:15,048 --> 02:34:16,248
Eddie!

2276
02:34:20,819 --> 02:34:22,021
Come on!
Let's go!

2277
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:28,060
Come on! Let's go!

2278
02:34:30,997 --> 02:34:31,998
Move, move!

2279
02:34:38,370 --> 02:34:40,188
Move, move!
Run!

2280
02:34:40,289 --> 02:34:41,289
Run!

2281
02:34:55,453 --> 02:34:56,873
Eddie!
No, no, no!

2282
02:34:56,972 --> 02:34:57,972
Eddie!

2283
02:34:59,692 --> 02:35:02,043
We gotta get in there
and get him!

2284
02:35:02,143 --> 02:35:03,795
He's still in there!

2285
02:35:14,438 --> 02:35:15,639
Eddie!

2286
02:35:16,309 --> 02:35:17,508
Eddie!

2287
02:36:17,269 --> 02:36:18,687
You know what?

2288
02:36:18,787 --> 02:36:21,924
Eddie would have
hated this, guys.

2289
02:36:22,024 --> 02:36:25,094
What? Cleaning ourselves
in dirty water?

2290
02:36:25,194 --> 02:36:26,194
Yeah.

2291
02:36:26,729 --> 02:36:29,430
He'd be telling us we'd get
streptococcal something.

2292
02:36:29,531 --> 02:36:30,531
Yeah.

2293
02:36:31,766 --> 02:36:33,405
But he would have
made us laugh, though.

2294
02:36:33,505 --> 02:36:34,769
Oh, yeah.

2295
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:36,822
He'd be
looking out for us.

2296
02:36:38,557 --> 02:36:40,591
The way he always was.

2297
02:36:44,463 --> 02:36:46,265
Ain't that right, Richie?

2298
02:36:48,835 --> 02:36:49,835
Hey.

2299
02:37:20,532 --> 02:37:21,532
Oh.

2300
02:37:22,468 --> 02:37:23,552
Thank you.

2301
02:37:23,651 --> 02:37:25,221
I don't have
my glasses on,

2302
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:27,361
so I don't know who you people
are, but thank you.

2303
02:37:29,541 --> 02:37:31,159
I legit
can't find my glasses.

2304
02:37:31,259 --> 02:37:32,461
You're serious?

2305
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:33,863
Glasses?
Go that way.

2306
02:37:33,962 --> 02:37:35,546
Around here somewhere?

2307
02:37:41,354 --> 02:37:43,390
I can't see them.
Oh, I see them. Right there.

2308
02:37:43,489 --> 02:37:45,373
Where?
Look. Right

2309
02:37:45,473 --> 02:37:46,858
If you just go, like

2310
02:37:47,626 --> 02:37:49,061
Anybody have any luck?

2311
02:38:51,189 --> 02:38:52,191
Hey, guys.

2312
02:38:54,060 --> 02:38:55,060
Look.

2313
02:39:04,737 --> 02:39:06,272
Nothing lasts forever.

2314
02:39:26,692 --> 02:39:28,393
I can't go home
like this, guys.

2315
02:39:29,262 --> 02:39:30,411
My mom will kill me.

2316
02:39:30,512 --> 02:39:32,847
Dude, you've been gone
for 24 straight hours.

2317
02:39:32,947 --> 02:39:35,116
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

2318
02:39:35,216 --> 02:39:37,753
Also, that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers.

2319
02:39:37,853 --> 02:39:39,021
Oh, shut up, Richie.

2320
02:39:39,121 --> 02:39:40,639
Okay, first of all,
my mom's slippers

2321
02:39:40,739 --> 02:39:42,490
smell like potpourri, asshole.

2322
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:44,025
No, they don't.

2323
02:39:44,125 --> 02:39:45,883
Yes, they do.
And, also, how would you know

2324
02:39:45,983 --> 02:39:47,622
what they smell like
in the first place?

2325
02:39:47,721 --> 02:39:48,800
Can we
just keep it quiet,

2326
02:39:48,900 --> 02:39:49,978
please,
until we get home?

2327
02:39:50,078 --> 02:39:51,635
"Potpourri" is
literally a French word

2328
02:39:51,736 --> 02:39:53,102
meaning "rotten pot."

2329
02:39:53,202 --> 02:39:54,962
I knew there
was something rotten about it.

2330
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:18,093
Mike?
Hey.

2331
02:40:18,193 --> 02:40:20,362
I just thought
I'd check up on you.

2332
02:40:20,462 --> 02:40:21,939
You know,
just to see if you learned

2333
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:23,277
how to finish
a book for once.

2334
02:40:25,350 --> 02:40:27,152
I just finished
the first chapter.

2335
02:40:28,888 --> 02:40:32,425
And I think I actually know
where I'm going this time.

2336
02:40:33,159 --> 02:40:34,159
Good.

2337
02:40:34,257 --> 02:40:36,144
Say, can I ask
you a question?

2338
02:40:36,245 --> 02:40:37,245
Sure.

2339
02:40:38,930 --> 02:40:40,832
Why do you think
we're not forgetting?

2340
02:40:41,733 --> 02:40:43,620
You know, like last time?

2341
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:45,437
Maybe 'cause It's dead.

2342
02:40:48,641 --> 02:40:49,991
Or maybe 'cause
we have more

2343
02:40:50,091 --> 02:40:52,528
we want to remember
than we want to forget.

2344
02:40:52,629 --> 02:40:54,146
I like that one.

2345
02:40:58,016 --> 02:40:59,294
You decide
what you want to do?

2346
02:40:59,394 --> 02:41:00,469
About leaving Derry?

2347
02:41:00,569 --> 02:41:02,921
Man, I've been in this cell
for 27 years.

2348
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:05,857
Just seeing
what It wanted me to.

2349
02:41:09,630 --> 02:41:12,364
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

2350
02:41:13,498 --> 02:41:15,651
Go get it, Mikey.

2351
02:41:15,751 --> 02:41:17,302
Oh, did you get the letter?

2352
02:41:18,536 --> 02:41:19,821
What letter?

2353
02:41:19,921 --> 02:41:22,659
You'll know
when you see it.

2354
02:41:22,758 --> 02:41:24,793
Well, hold on.
I just got the mail.

2355
02:41:24,892 --> 02:41:26,379
We all got one.

2356
02:41:28,980 --> 02:41:30,215
Patricia Uris?

2357
02:41:31,183 --> 02:41:32,184
Just

2358
02:41:33,352 --> 02:41:34,670
Just read it.

2359
02:41:34,771 --> 02:41:35,771
Okay.

2360
02:41:35,937 --> 02:41:38,157
And call me.
Anytime.

2361
02:41:38,924 --> 02:41:40,209
I will.

2362
02:41:40,309 --> 02:41:41,359
And, Bill,

2363
02:41:46,998 --> 02:41:49,250
I love you, man.

2364
02:41:49,350 --> 02:41:51,052
I love you, too.

2365
02:41:51,152 --> 02:41:53,506
All right.
See you around.

2366
02:42:20,667 --> 02:42:23,017
Dear Losers,

2367
02:42:23,117 --> 02:42:25,053
I know what this must seem like,

2368
02:42:25,153 --> 02:42:26,938
but this isn't
a suicide note.

2369
02:42:28,709 --> 02:42:32,393
You're probably wondering
why I did what I did.

2370
02:42:32,494 --> 02:42:35,497
It's because I knew I was
too scared to go back.

2371
02:42:35,596 --> 02:42:37,567
And if
we weren't together,

2372
02:42:37,667 --> 02:42:41,003
if all of us alive
weren't united,

2373
02:42:41,103 --> 02:42:43,304
I knew we'd all die.

2374
02:42:43,405 --> 02:42:47,744
So, I made
the only logical move.

2375
02:42:47,844 --> 02:42:49,527
I took myself
off the board.

2376
02:42:51,798 --> 02:42:53,399
Did it work?

2377
02:42:55,067 --> 02:42:57,103
Well, if you're reading
this, you know the answer.

2378
02:42:59,437 --> 02:43:01,407
I lived
my whole life afraid.

2379
02:43:03,275 --> 02:43:07,328
Afraid of
what would come next.

2380
02:43:07,428 --> 02:43:09,481
Afraid of what
I might leave behind.

2381
02:43:12,451 --> 02:43:13,486
Don't.

2382
02:43:15,521 --> 02:43:17,623
Be who you want to be.

2383
02:43:18,891 --> 02:43:20,459
Be proud.

2384
02:43:21,193 --> 02:43:22,811
You sleep okay?

2385
02:43:22,911 --> 02:43:23,911
Yeah.

2386
02:43:25,164 --> 02:43:27,182
I had a beautiful dream.

2387
02:43:27,282 --> 02:43:30,102
And if you find
someone worth holding on to,

2388
02:43:31,302 --> 02:43:34,173
never ever let them go.

2389
02:43:42,748 --> 02:43:44,417
Follow your own path.

2390
02:43:49,053 --> 02:43:50,555
Wherever that takes you.

2391
02:43:57,096 --> 02:44:00,231
Think of this letter
as a promise.

2392
02:44:03,234 --> 02:44:05,371
A promise
I'm asking you to make.

2393
02:44:06,605 --> 02:44:07,606
To me.

2394
02:44:08,841 --> 02:44:10,176
To each other.

2395
02:44:12,111 --> 02:44:13,545
An oath.

2396
02:44:17,416 --> 02:44:19,452
See,
the thing about being a Loser

2397
02:44:22,153 --> 02:44:24,222
is you don't have
anything to lose.

2398
02:44:26,892 --> 02:44:27,892
So

2399
02:44:28,911 --> 02:44:30,512
Be true.

2400
02:44:30,914 --> 02:44:32,096
Be brave.

2401
02:44:33,132 --> 02:44:34,332
Stand.

2402
02:44:35,099 --> 02:44:36,700
Believe.

2403
02:44:37,151 --> 02:44:39,437
And don't ever forget

2404
02:44:40,572 --> 02:44:42,041
We're Losers,

2405
02:44:43,309 --> 02:44:45,276
and we always will be.
