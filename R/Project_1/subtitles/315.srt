2
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,130
Morning,
Mr. Thrombey.

3
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,811
Mr. Thrombey? You up there?

4
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:03,381
Mr. Thrombey,
I'm coming in.

5
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,826
Shit!

6
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,182
<i>You killed him, you bastard!</i>

7
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,283
<i>You murdered him!</i>

8
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,817
<i>I didn't murder nobody!</i>

9
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,152
<i>You slashed
his face open.</i>

10
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:45,588
<i>You left him bleeding in
the street like a stuck pig,</i>

11
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,823
<i>then you crushed his skull
with a forklift</i>

12
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,226
<i>and burned his hands off
to erase the fingerprints!</i>

13
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,561
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

14
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:53,895
<i>We have
the nanny-cam footage!</i>

15
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,063
Alice, turn that
off now, please?

16
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,032
- <i>You're under arrest for...</i>
- Why? It's almost over.

17
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,034
- Now. Please, just turn it off.
- What? They're finding out who did it

18
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,136
and the WiFi
sucks in my room,

19
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,170
- so give me a break.
- Turn it off, now.

20
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:02,138
- There's two minutes left.
- Alice!

21
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,274
- What? There isn't even anything bad on.
- Off!

22
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:05,941
It's just normal TV

23
00:03:05,943 --> 00:03:07,277
- and they're just talking!
- They're talking murder on it!

24
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,177
Normal TV,
and they're just talking!

25
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,279
Your sister just
had a friend she loved...

26
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,281
- Okay, okay! Okay! Whatever.
- ...slit his throat open

27
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:13,316
and she doesn't need to
be hearing that right now!

28
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,818
Let's be sensitive!

29
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:21,190
Alice, you can keep watching your
show, it's fine.

30
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:22,425
No, I guessed
who did it anyway.

31
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:24,360
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, Marta.

32
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:25,996
It's okay.

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,799
It's Harlan's son.

34
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,603
Hi, Walt.

35
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,871
- <i>Hi, Marta, it's Walt.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

36
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,906
<i>Would you mind coming
to the house early?</i>

37
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:41,076
<i>The police have a few
more questions for everybody.</i>

38
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,213
What?

39
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,999
Hey.
Excuse me, ma'am.

40
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,134
You with the help?

41
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:08,003
Hey! Her name's Marta.
She was Grandad's nurse.

42
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,939
She's with us.
"The help"?

43
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:12,675
It's okay.
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:15,213
No, it's not okay.
What the hell?

45
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,949
Aw.

46
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,124
How are
you doing?

47
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,459
Not very good.

48
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,462
Alone.

49
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:35,166
Lots of this and not
knowing what to do next.

50
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:39,968
Marta, anything
you need...

51
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,473
You're part of
this family.

52
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,642
Thank you.

53
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,444
- How you doing, kiddo?
- Linda.

54
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:50,646
How are you?

55
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,185
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

56
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,086
I thought you should
have been there.

57
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,055
- I was outvoted.
- Get arrested!

58
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:02,360
- Die up your own ass for all I care!
- Richard.

59
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,096
He's not coming.

60
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:07,663
Ransom. Little shit.

61
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:08,666
Missed the funeral.

62
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,999
Excuse me.

63
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,402
Uh, we're ready
for you now.

64
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:14,137
We'd like to see you
one at a time.

65
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,372
All right.
Uh, I'll go first.

66
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:18,408
I'm assuming this
will all be wrapped up

67
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,209
before the
memorial tonight.

68
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,711
We'll do
our best, ma'am.

69
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:26,115
So...

70
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,718
How you
doing, kiddo?

71
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,454
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

72
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,222
I am Detective
Lieutenant Elliot,

73
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:34,757
and this is
Trooper Wagner.

74
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,227
Now, um,
I'm going to record this,

75
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,196
just to make things easier.

76
00:05:40,198 --> 00:05:43,766
All right, we're with
Linda Drysdale nee Thrombey,

77
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:45,635
Harlan Thrombey's
eldest daughter,

78
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,370
and discussing
the events that took place

79
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,439
the night of his demise
one week ago.

80
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:50,740
November eighth.

81
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,577
We're very sorry
for your loss.

82
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,746
Thank you.
That means a lot.

83
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,681
So, we understand
on that night

84
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:00,116
the family had gathered

85
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,185
to celebrate your
father's 85th birthday?

86
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:03,453
Yes.

87
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:06,255
- How was it? Uh...
- The party?

88
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:07,492
Pre-my-dad's-death?

89
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:10,226
Oh, it was great.

90
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,495
Did anyone besides
the family show face?

91
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,198
<i>Um, Fran,
the housekeeper.</i>

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,167
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

93
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,236
- Jacob?
- And I've dated Italian guys.

94
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,104
You know what I mean?
It was like...

95
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,540
<i>Marta,
Harlan's caregiver.</i>

96
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,676
<i>Good girl. Hard worker.</i>

97
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,246
Her family's from Ecuador.

98
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:30,746
And Wanetta.

99
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:33,115
<i>Great nana. Harlan's mom.</i>

100
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,451
- Hi, Nana.
- <i>His mom?</i>

101
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,653
- Nana?
- <i>Wow. How old is she?</i>

102
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,455
<i>We have no idea.</i>

103
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:41,624
Okay, um,
and your son, Ransom,

104
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:43,426
<i>did he attend as well?</i>

105
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:45,196
<i>Yes, but he left early.</i>

106
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,334
Ransom, are you leaving?

107
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,505
Right, um...

108
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:57,240
Would you say that
all three of you showed up

109
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,409
around the same time?

110
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,745
No.

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,616
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

112
00:07:06,618 --> 00:07:08,584
Okay. And you and
your husband, Richard,

113
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,219
work at a real estate
firm in Boston?

114
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,488
No. It's...
It's my company.

115
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,123
Right. Right. Sorry.

116
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,825
I built my business
from the ground up.

117
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,793
Oh, just like your father.

118
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,463
You two were very close.

119
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:23,833
We... We had our own secret
way of communicating.

120
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:27,203
I mean, you had to
find that with Dad.

121
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:29,238
You had to find a game
to play with him,

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,677
and if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

123
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:41,217
Everyone idolizes
their dad, right?

124
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,720
I don't know.
Do they?

125
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:45,888
Very much not.

126
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,757
Don't know why
I said that.

127
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,159
<i>But my wife, Linda, does.</i>

128
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:52,528
<i>Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith Corona</i>

129
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,863
<i>and built himself into</i>

130
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,799
<i>one of the best-selling
mystery writers of all time.</i>

131
00:07:56,801 --> 00:08:01,172
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

132
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:03,973
Sure.

133
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:06,609
For the record,
I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,

134
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,278
Harlan Thrombey's
youngest son.

135
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,781
So, you run your father's
publishing company?

136
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,317
Yeah. It's my...
It's our...

137
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,385
Uh, it's the family's
publishing company.

138
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:17,622
Dad trusts me to run it.

139
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,456
Thirty languages.

140
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,327
Over 80 million copies sold.
A real legacy.

141
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,195
Mmm-hmm.
- You guys fans?

142
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,731
I mean, I don't do much
fiction reading myself, but...

143
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,433
Big fan.
I'm a big fan.

144
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,635
I mean,
his plots are just like...

145
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,903
Like, I won't
spoil it for you but...

146
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:35,571
Okay, like
<i>Thousand Knives?</i>

147
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,906
<i>The Cow
and the Shotgun?</i>

148
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:39,375
Like, where do you
come up with that?

149
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:40,910
Well, Dad said
the plots just

150
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:42,912
popped into his head,
fully formed.

151
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:44,480
It was the easy part for him.

152
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,651
Um, so you're
in the area, right?

153
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,354
Uh, you guys probably
arrived around the same time.

154
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,255
Uh...

155
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:55,691
We all got here
around 8:00.

156
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,860
<i>My wife, Donna, she's my rock.</i>

157
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:02,398
Jesus, Donna!
Are you all right?

158
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,334
<i>My son, Jacob, he's 16.</i>

159
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,637
<i>Very politically active.</i>

160
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,405
The boy is
literally a Nazi.

161
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,741
He's an alt-right
troll dipshit.

162
00:09:11,743 --> 00:09:14,610
Kids today with the
Internet, it's amazing.

163
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,581
So the night went well?

164
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,716
<i>I mean,
we're all gutted, but, uh,</i>

165
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,952
<i>I was happy to have
that night with him.</i>

166
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,488
<i>To be by his side.
To think about our books</i>

167
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,224
<i>and what we've accomplished
with them.</i>

168
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,895
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

169
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,363
Passing the torch.

170
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,599
So, we're here
with Joni Thrombey,

171
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,634
Harlan Thrombey's
daughter-in-law?

172
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:41,437
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, I married his son, Neil.

173
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,539
We had one daughter, Meg.

174
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,543
And then Neil passed on
15 years ago.

175
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,645
But you remained close
to the Thrombeys?

176
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:52,348
Oh! They're my family.

177
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:58,354
<i>I feel
simultaneously freed by</i>

178
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:01,424
<i>and supported by them.</i>

179
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,366
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

180
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,566
Sorry, the nugget of...

181
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,934
Flam.

182
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:15,271
Oh. Yeah, Flam,
your skincare company. Sorry.

183
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,474
I forgive you.

184
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,340
Yeah, it's skincare,

185
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,543
but it promotes a total
lifestyle.

186
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,812
Self-sufficiency with
an acknowledgement

187
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:24,046
of human need.

188
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:25,414
That's Flam.

189
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,349
But it's also Harlan.

190
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,819
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

191
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,420
Grandad gives my mom
a yearly allowance

192
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,855
and he's never missed wiring

193
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:34,892
a tuition payment
to my schools.

194
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,862
He's a genuinely
selfless man.

195
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,931
But you left
the party early?

196
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,998
Have fun.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,300
<i>To see some friends at Smith.</i>

198
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,068
You know Dad pays for her

199
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,005
crypto-Marxist-post-
deconstructural-

200
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:53,309
feminist-poetry-theory-
whatever major?

201
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,611
She could have stuck
around for the cake.

202
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,381
<i>I think Linda was upset.</i>

203
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,951
Hmm.

204
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,754
But Harlan understood.

205
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,390
Right.

206
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,861
Um, you two showed up to the
party around the same time...

207
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,029
If I could pause?

208
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:15,032
Because I just...

209
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,433
Who is that guy?

210
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:19,368
And why are we doing
all this again?

211
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,669
This is just some
follow-up questions.

212
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,105
Um, we're attempting
to be thorough,

213
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,806
so we can figure out
the manner of death.

214
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,407
So by "manner of death,"

215
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,876
you mean if
someone killed him?

216
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:28,911
If one of us killed him?

217
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,347
- One of his family killed him?
- No, no, Walt, Walt, no, no...

218
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:32,748
Is that what you're
suggesting, Lieutenant?

219
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,816
No one's
saying that, okay?

220
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,486
This is all
pro-forma.

221
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,021
Okay.

222
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:39,724
So who the fuck is that?

223
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,690
Um...

224
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:43,926
This is
Benoit Blanc.

225
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:46,729
- Benoit Blanc?
- Yes.

226
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:48,531
Mr. Blanc is
a private investigator

227
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:49,698
of great renown.

228
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,966
Wait a minute.

229
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:54,137
I read a tweet about a
<i>New Yorker</i> article about you.

230
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,639
"The Last
of the Gentlemen Sleuths."

231
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:59,008
You solved that case
with the tennis champ?

232
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,112
You're famous.

233
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,413
Mr. Blanc is not
with the police department

234
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:06,015
and not officially involved
in the case,

235
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,750
but he's offered to consult.

236
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:10,085
Now, I happily obliged,
and I can vouch for him.

237
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,987
Mr. Blanc,
I know who you are.

238
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:13,923
I read your profile
in the <i>New Yorker.</i>

239
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:16,425
I found it delightful.

240
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:19,595
I just buried
my 85-year-old father

241
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:21,564
who committed suicide.

242
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,966
Why are you here?

243
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,638
I'm here
at the behest of a client.

244
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:29,407
Who?

245
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:32,608
I cannot say.

246
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,643
But let me assure you this.

247
00:12:34,645 --> 00:12:38,047
My presence
will be ornamental.

248
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,816
You will find me a respectful,

249
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:43,654
quiet, passive observer

250
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,023
of the truth.

251
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,058
Fine.

252
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,559
Are we getting there?

253
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,794
Nearly. Um...

254
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,063
Harlan's nurse,
she was at the party

255
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,031
in a professional capacity?

256
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,034
Marta?

257
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:58,968
I guess.

258
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,204
<i>Harlan hired her
to be around to take care</i>

259
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,606
<i>of whatever medical needs
popped up.</i>

260
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,644
<i>But really,
she's like part of the family.</i>

261
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:08,477
<i>Good kid.</i>

262
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,113
<i>Been a good friend to Harlan.</i>

263
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:12,047
<i>Family's from Paraguay.</i>

264
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,119
Linda really likes
her work ethic.

265
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:18,389
"Immigrants.
We get the job done."

266
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,858
- I...
- From <i>Hamilton.</i>

267
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,526
Oh, <i>Hamilton.</i>

268
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,661
It's so good.
It's so good.

269
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,465
- I saw it at The Public.
- Oh!

270
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,902
May I just, um...

271
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,869
Then I'll recede, but...

272
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,940
As a self-made
man myself,

273
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,109
I have to express
my admiration

274
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,712
for how you followed
in your father's footsteps.

275
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,915
- Thank you.
- Just marvelous.

276
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:47,950
You know,
the whole family, too.

277
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,919
And Joni with her thing,

278
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:52,521
and Walt with his
publishing empire...

279
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,724
It's...

280
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,660
Well...

281
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:00,096
Yes, I mean, Walt,
he's done well

282
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,598
with what Dad gave him.

283
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,632
Not that it matters.

284
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,702
But really, Dad hands him
a book twice a year

285
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:07,872
and Walt publishes it.

286
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,073
It's just not the same.

287
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:15,278
But surely Walt runs the
merchandising, adaptations,

288
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,513
film and television rights,
I mean...

289
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:19,182
Are you baiting me, Detective?

290
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,718
You know he doesn't.

291
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,987
And if you think
I am dumb enough

292
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,990
to be baited into
talking family business,

293
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,559
into shit-talking
my baby brother,

294
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,195
in front of
a police detective,

295
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,729
and a state trooper...

296
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,898
Walt doesn't run shit.

297
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,567
Because there are no TV
and film rights.

298
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,271
Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

299
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:42,671
Hated the idea.

300
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,772
No.

301
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,040
Yeah!

302
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,742
Drives Walt nuts.

303
00:14:46,744 --> 00:14:48,844
'Cause that's where
the real money is.

304
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,214
When Walt would get
a little Irish courage in him,

305
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:53,149
- <i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i>
- The window is...

306
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,619
Did he "get into it"
at the party?

307
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,619
Oh, my God!

308
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:58,787
Come on, Dad!

309
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,589
<i>Wouldn't leave
him alone, the poor guy.</i>

310
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,125
<i>Harlan finally had
to give him the hook.</i>

311
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,759
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy...

312
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:05,228
<i>I didn't hear
what he said,</i>

313
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,730
<i>but he must've really
handed him his lunch.</i>

314
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:11,301
<i>'Cause Walt was like a wounded
puppy the rest of the night.</i>

315
00:15:11,303 --> 00:15:12,835
What? Richard said what?

316
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,837
No. Jesus.
We did not get "into it."

317
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,341
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

318
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:20,709
Harlan took you aside
at the party.

319
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,781
When you returned,
you were chastened.

320
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,586
What did Harlan say to you?

321
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,288
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

322
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,224
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time,

323
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,991
and I just think
this is a window

324
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:37,760
that's not
gonna stay open.

325
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,861
We need to take
advantage of it

326
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:40,863
and then you just need
to look at the numbers!

327
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:42,898
- Yeah, Walt, look...
- Dad! Dad!

328
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,768
You... You put me
in charge of our books.

329
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,670
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

330
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:51,040
They're not
our books, son.

331
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,176
They're my books.

332
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:56,312
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

333
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:58,847
But you're right,
you're right.

334
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,885
It's unfair of me
to keep you tethered

335
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:05,788
to something that
isn't yours to control.

336
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,855
What?

337
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:10,594
No, I've done you
a grave disservice.

338
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:13,229
All these years,

339
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,898
I've kept you
from building something

340
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,236
of your own
that was yours.

341
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:22,838
But you're not
going to be running

342
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,177
the publishing house
anymore.

343
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,044
You're free of it.

344
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,046
Whoa...

345
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,382
Dad, are you
firing me?

346
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,650
No...

347
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,188
We'll talk
details tomorrow.

348
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:38,656
My mind's made up.

349
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:41,226
Good boy.

350
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,903
We talked. We had a business
discussion about e-books.

351
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:56,108
Jesus. It was nothing.

352
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,907
You want to talk
about an argument,

353
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,809
hell, Ransom had
an argument with him.

354
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:01,977
Ransom, that's, uh,

355
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,813
- Richard and Linda's son?
- Mmm.

356
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,785
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid. We love him.

357
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,986
But?

358
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,389
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

359
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:14,457
Ah.

360
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,092
And I'm not trying to...

361
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:18,261
I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.

362
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:21,164
But with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

363
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,866
And Dad,
for some unknown reason,

364
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,335
always supported him.

365
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,706
They have this love-hate bond.
They fight.

366
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,244
But that night, God,
they had a blowout.

367
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:34,110
About what?

368
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:35,944
Are you goddamn insane?

369
00:17:35,946 --> 00:17:37,280
<i>We couldn't
make it out really,</i>

370
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:39,081
<i>but it was huge.</i>

371
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,185
<i>And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.</i>

372
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,420
<i>Usually they like
to stoke up drama</i>

373
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,722
<i>in front of the whole family.</i>

374
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:48,158
Speaking of getting into it...

375
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:54,029
You were at the house early,
to help the caterers set up. Did...

376
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,467
Did you converse with Harlan
at that time?

377
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:59,935
Well, he was there.
We must have spoke.

378
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,173
In his study?

379
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,341
I don't think so.

380
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:08,411
You see, I spoke
with the caterer this morning,

381
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:11,181
she didn't see you
helping her staff.

382
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,882
She did hear Harlan
in a screaming match

383
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,254
with somebody that afternoon
in his study.

384
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,421
Yeah, I don't...

385
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:20,225
- Screaming match?
- Mmm-hmm.

386
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,392
No.

387
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,825
Um...

388
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:25,228
But Joni was here, too.

389
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,829
Um, she was early,
so it might have been her.

390
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:28,964
You can maybe ask her.

391
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:31,134
These were two male voices.

392
00:18:31,136 --> 00:18:33,068
<i>Harlan shouted the phrase...</i>

393
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,273
You tell her or I will!

394
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,242
"You tell her

395
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,743
"or I will!"

396
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,080
Bells ringing?

397
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,423
That's none
of your business.

398
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,424
You stay out
of my marriage.

399
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,560
I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.

400
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:00,296
I've put all of it
in this letter to her.

401
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:01,964
Tomorrow, she gets it.

402
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,832
Harlan, I'm warning you.

403
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,368
- No, she deserves to know.
- You stay out of my marriage.

404
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,470
She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.

405
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:10,308
- The hell I am!
- You tell her or I will!

406
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,146
Yes. I know.

407
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,013
Yes.

408
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:20,882
Uh...

409
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:25,521
Harlan had finally decided to
put his mom in a nursing home

410
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:27,923
and Linda had
always opposed that.

411
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,292
And I wanted to wait
until we got back

412
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,327
to Boston, uh, to tell Linda,

413
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:34,197
so, to avoid a whole scene,

414
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:37,034
and Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

415
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,169
That was it.

416
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,473
Sorry. Forgot.

417
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,340
The house?

418
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:47,876
Uh, early.
Richard said you were there.

419
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,047
I was at the house early.

420
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,217
To see Harlan?

421
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:54,885
To see Harlan.

422
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,820
Yes.

423
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:00,323
What were you
seeing Harlan about?

424
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,958
It was just a mix-up
with the, uh,

425
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,027
the payment for Meg's tuition.

426
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,296
I'm... I'm...

427
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,965
I'm sorry to press,

428
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,102
but what kind of mix-up?

429
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:14,370
Yeah, the school hasn't
got the check yet.

430
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,406
I don't know why Alan
didn't mail it.

431
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:18,040
Well,
Alan didn't mail it

432
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,244
because he caught
a discrepancy.

433
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:25,315
Alan's office has been wiring
tuition directly to the school

434
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,015
as per your request.

435
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,353
But Phyllis's office that
handles your yearly allowance

436
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:34,159
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.

437
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:38,094
You have been double-dipping
Meg's tuition

438
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,429
and stealing from me.

439
00:20:39,431 --> 00:20:42,398
$100,000 a year,

440
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,267
for the past four years.

441
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,336
Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,

442
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:47,969
but I swear to God...

443
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:49,905
So, now I am writing
this tuition check,

444
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:52,308
but you must know
that this is the last money

445
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,578
you or Meg will get from me.

446
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,246
Please,
you don't understand...

447
00:20:57,248 --> 00:20:59,047
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

448
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,951
but it's all for the best.

449
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:04,021
My mind's made up.

450
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:09,492
It was, uh,
a money wiring issue

451
00:21:09,494 --> 00:21:11,194
with the office at the school.

452
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:14,297
So I had to ask Harlan to cut
a check for the semester.

453
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:15,600
Mmm. No big deal.

454
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:17,600
Well...

455
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,302
Why don't we,
uh, just take

456
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,503
a little break
and we'll resu...

457
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:22,070
Oh, no...

458
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,174
She's gone.

459
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:32,217
Richard!

460
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:35,050
Joni, have you
seen Richard?

461
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:36,586
No, I was, uh,
just done with the, um...

462
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,655
Okay, thanks.

463
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,425
No.

464
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:42,893
Damn it. Richard!

465
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:46,063
Richard?

466
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,429
Son of a bitch.

467
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:30,773
See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,

468
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,008
but when
the great Benoit Blanc

469
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,510
comes knocking
at my door,

470
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:36,546
I expect it's going
to be about something,

471
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:38,347
if not extraordinary,

472
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:40,683
then at least interesting.

473
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:41,651
But... I'm sorry,

474
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:45,086
this is an open-and-shut
case of suicide

475
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:46,622
and, uh, quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point

476
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:48,357
where I need to know
what we're doing here.

477
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,360
The method?

478
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:52,330
Throat slit?

479
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:54,730
Typical for
a suicide?

480
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:56,666
Yes, I mean,
that's dramatic.

481
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,668
But look around.

482
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,372
I mean, the guy practically
lives in a Clue board.

483
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,513
<i>Come on, Benny,
talk to me, all right?</i>

484
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,182
<i>Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back</i>

485
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,751
<i>for questioning
all over again. I get it.</i>

486
00:23:15,753 --> 00:23:17,186
<i>Listen,
I've had boots on the ground</i>

487
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,321
<i>in this county
for a while now.</i>

488
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,589
<i>People are generally
what they seem to be.</i>

489
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:21,624
<i>You're not gonna find
murderers in this family.</i>

490
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:23,058
<i>This is a pleasant family</i>

491
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,293
<i>with the usual quarrels,</i>

492
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:26,329
<i>but no possible motives
for murder.</i>

493
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:27,398
<i>Where are you going?</i>

494
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:35,404
Harlan Thrombey's nurse.
Marta...

495
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:37,139
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera. Please.

496
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:38,608
Miss Cabrera,
you can just wait inside

497
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,278
- and we'll be with you in...
- Miss Cabrera.

498
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,182
I've been doin'
a little pokin'.

499
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:48,083
You were hired
on a part-time basis

500
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:49,719
as a registered
nurse, yes?

501
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:52,388
Uh, yes. I don't work for a VNA.

502
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,156
Harlan hired
me directly.

503
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:56,192
Take a seat, please.

504
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,496
And you're paid
a flat rate

505
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,364
for how many hours a week?

506
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:02,598
Um...

507
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,603
Well, I started at 15,
and then he...

508
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:07,870
He needed more help.

509
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:09,541
Medical help?

510
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,545
He needed a friend.

511
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,583
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

512
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,418
All right, Blanc,
I mean, this is...

513
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,587
Yeah, yeah. Marta?
We were just discussing

514
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,789
possible motives
in the family.

515
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,325
I suspect that
Harlan has told you

516
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,694
much unfiltered truth
about each of 'em.

517
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:35,131
And a little bird
has told me,

518
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,302
how shall I
put this delicately...

519
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:42,471
You have
a regurgitative reaction

520
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:44,342
to mistruthin'.

521
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,876
Who told you that?

522
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,511
Is it true?

523
00:24:48,513 --> 00:24:49,547
Uh...

524
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:52,315
- Yes.
- Oh.

525
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:54,817
It's something
I've had since I was a kid.

526
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:57,186
It's a physical thing
that I...

527
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:58,621
Just the thought of lying...

528
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,290
Yeah, it makes me puke.

529
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,658
Really?

530
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:08,733
Is Richard havin' an affair?

531
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:14,704
Why do men instinctively

532
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:18,276
pull at loose threads
on their parachutes?

533
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,511
What?

534
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:29,285
Richard?

535
00:25:29,287 --> 00:25:30,421
Mmm-hmm.

536
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,524
- An affair?
- Yeah.

537
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,394
A yes or no will do.

538
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,329
Mmm... No.

539
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:45,835
Oh, shit!

540
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,303
- Oh, my God!
- Dear girl, I'm sorry.

541
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:49,805
- I assumed you were speaking figuratively.
- Here, have some water.

542
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,208
- I have Wet-Naps in the car.
- All right, here, here.

543
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,676
Just take a
sip of this.

544
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,944
Take that.

545
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,246
- That's quite somethin'.
- Hmm?

546
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,615
- Thanks.
- But I was obviously right.

547
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,217
Richard is having
an affair.

548
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:03,452
His father-in-law found
out and confronted him.

549
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:04,720
"You tell her
or I will."

550
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,389
Okay, but even if
that were the case, he...

551
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:07,657
You all right?

552
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:08,724
Yeah.

553
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:09,792
Even if that were
the case, I mean,

554
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:11,560
protecting a relationship
as a motive,

555
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:13,295
that's weak sauce.
You know that.

556
00:26:13,297 --> 00:26:15,297
Well, then there
is Joni.

557
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:16,532
- Joni?
- Joni?

558
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,933
Lifestyle guru Joni?

559
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,535
No, Harlan was supporting
her and her daughter

560
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:20,736
and that's the
opposite of a motive.

561
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:22,371
And if that support
was threatened...

562
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,639
Miss Cabrera,
one moment, please.

563
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:24,974
Yes, I just wanna
get some Scope.

564
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,242
Miss Cabrera...

565
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:30,848
Was Harlan plannin' on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

566
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:35,353
Oh, Joni.

567
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:37,755
What's up?

568
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:42,324
Oh, my God.

569
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:43,426
All right, don't answer that

570
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:44,727
if you're gonna
puke again, please.

571
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,629
Meg said he paid
the school directly.

572
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:48,366
Joni said he sent
the money to her.

573
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:50,499
Both were true.

574
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:52,468
She was pocketing
the double payment.

575
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,536
Harlan found out,

576
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:55,004
and cut her off
without a cent.

577
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:56,005
Yes?

578
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:59,608
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

579
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,544
Come on, no,
have you seen her Insta?

580
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:02,678
She's an influencer.

581
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,513
No, allowance
as a motive?

582
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:05,948
Again, more weak sauce.

583
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,750
You're just dumpin' that vat
of weak sauce on me.

584
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,754
Granted. But she
lied to me.

585
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:11,921
All three of them did.

586
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:12,924
Three?

587
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,791
Walter.

588
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:18,294
Ah. I see where you're
going with this.

589
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:20,996
Harlan had turned Walter down
before regarding film rights,

590
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:23,599
but that night, somethin'
Harlan said shook him.

591
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,367
Now we look at the pattern.

592
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:27,238
Harlan was cleanin' house.

593
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:29,273
No wonder.

594
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:31,941
Did he plan to fire Walter?

595
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,309
Can I just wait inside?

596
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,376
I feel like
I shouldn't be here.

597
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:35,578
Yeah, please,
just wait inside.

598
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,914
Stay close, all right?

599
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,821
You have been
very patient, my friend.

600
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:45,757
And yes,

601
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:47,590
you are right.

602
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:49,992
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles

603
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:51,727
answer your question...

604
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:54,930
"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"

605
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:56,901
Well, now I will tell you why.

606
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,902
I'm here because this mornin',

607
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,607
someone dodged
a very important question.

608
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:04,842
Who?

609
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,110
Me.

610
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:09,578
Linda asked
who hired me.

611
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,015
Well, who hired you?

612
00:28:11,783 --> 00:28:14,483
I do not know.

613
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,419
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday

614
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:19,588
with a news clippin'
of Thrombey's death.

615
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,958
An envelope?
That worked?

616
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:25,761
- An envelope of cash.
- Hmm.

617
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:28,098
So somebody
suspects foul play

618
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,433
and goes through this
ha cha dance of hiring me,

619
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:32,804
of staying anonymous.

620
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:35,873
It makes no damn sense.

621
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:39,043
Compels me, though.

622
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,078
Walk me through
everyone's whereabouts

623
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,081
at the time of death.

624
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,851
We know that the party ended
around 11:30.

625
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:49,785
- Good night, Joni.
- 'Night.

626
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:51,620
<i>Marta took Harlan upstairs</i>

627
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:52,788
<i>to give him his meds.</i>

628
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,127
<i>The stairs leading
up to Harlan's bedroom</i>

629
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,662
<i>and his attic office
creak horribly</i>

630
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,664
<i>and Linda is a light sleeper.</i>

631
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:02,665
<i>So we know every time</i>

632
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,700
<i>someone took the stairs
that night.</i>

633
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,872
<i>The first was
when Joni heard a ka-thunk</i>

634
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,774
<i>from somewhere above her
in the house.</i>

635
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:22,585
<i>She's concerned about Harlan,</i>

636
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,753
<i>so she goes up
to investigate...</i>

637
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:28,023
<i>Waking Linda.</i>

638
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:30,492
<i>Harlan was in his attic office
with Marta.</i>

639
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:31,894
- Hi, Joni.
- I just... Hi.

640
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,028
<i>He explained that
they had just</i>

641
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,963
<i>knocked over the Go board.</i>

642
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,332
I just knocked over
the Go board, so...

643
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:37,700
<i>You know, that game
with the grid and stones?</i>

644
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:38,934
<i>They play it every night.</i>

645
00:29:38,936 --> 00:29:40,170
<i>He was fine. "Go to bed."</i>

646
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:41,770
Go to bed, Joni.

647
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:43,206
- Love you. 'Night.
- Love you.

648
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,842
- <i>So she did.</i>
- Bye.

649
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,076
<i>Ten minutes later,</i>

650
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:49,011
<i>Linda is awoken
a second time...</i>

651
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:52,548
<i>By Marta leaving.</i>

652
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,483
Walt, I'm leaving.

653
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:57,086
<i>Walt was smokin' a cigar
on the porch with his son.</i>

654
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,056
<i>He saw her leave
and drive off.</i>

655
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:01,557
<i>Noted the time.</i>

656
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,825
<i>Midnight.</i>

657
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,300
<i>Fifteen minutes later,</i>

658
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:13,068
<i>Linda is awoken for the third
and final time...</i>

659
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:18,040
<i>By someone coming
down the stairs.</i>

660
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:20,643
<i>Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.</i>

661
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:22,178
Dad, go back to bed.

662
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,182
<i>Which Walt tried
to discourage.</i>

663
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,316
<i>Based on this,</i>

664
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:28,118
<i>the medical examiner
determined the time of death</i>

665
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,121
<i>to be between
12:15 and 2.00 a.m.</i>

666
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,922
<i>As Walt was
finishing his cigar</i>

667
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:35,024
<i>at about 12:30, Meg came home.</i>

668
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:36,759
<i>She went straight to bed.</i>

669
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:39,662
<i>Walt and Jacob
turned in shortly after that.</i>

670
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,499
<i>And sometime later that night,</i>

671
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:46,535
<i>it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,</i>

672
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:49,738
<i>Meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside.</i>

673
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,775
<i>She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.</i>

674
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,677
That's it. All right?

675
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,745
Now, everyone's
stories matched,

676
00:30:56,747 --> 00:30:58,482
every moment
accounted for.

677
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:01,517
And there is
no other staircase

678
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,718
up to Harlan's room?

679
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,620
None. Just the creaky one.

680
00:31:04,622 --> 00:31:05,621
Interesting.

681
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:08,724
So, uh, we know that
Ransom didn't do it

682
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:10,025
because he
wasn't there.

683
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:11,593
Marta couldn't have.

684
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:13,263
Harlan was still alive
when she left.

685
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:14,897
- Yeah.
- Meg...

686
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:16,632
Meg came home
during the window

687
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:17,700
- of the time of death, right?
- Now look, look, it was a...

688
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:19,735
Except it was a suicide,
all right?

689
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,837
Harlan slit right
through his carotid.

690
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,639
We saw from
the blood splat patterns

691
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:25,040
that they
were uninterrupted,

692
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,076
meaning, it's almost
impossible for anyone

693
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:29,912
to have been around him
at the time.

694
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:31,214
He's the one who cut his
own throat, all right?

695
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:32,781
I don't know why
we keep goin' over this.

696
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:35,185
Physical evidence
can tell a clear story

697
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,821
with a forked tongue.

698
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:38,455
What?

699
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:40,889
And as we can see
from this mornin',

700
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:42,658
everyone can lie.

701
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:45,728
Well,

702
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,097
almost everyone.

703
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,202
Miss Cabrera, um...

704
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,969
We kept you waiting
all afternoon,

705
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:57,207
because I wanted to hear
from you last.

706
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:01,910
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,

707
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:05,583
and your piece of it
is at its very center.

708
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,086
So, please
take your time.

709
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:15,293
You took Mr. Thrombey
upstairs at 11:30

710
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:18,261
and left at midnight.

711
00:32:18,263 --> 00:32:20,062
Think very carefully

712
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:24,234
and with as much detail
as possible.

713
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,139
Tell us what happened
in that half hour?

714
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:34,076
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Yeah, you got it?

715
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,678
Up, up, up, I got it.
Up, up, up, I got it.

716
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,013
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Okay, that's...

717
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:39,915
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Hey, Harlan...

718
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,317
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Let's...

719
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,651
Up, up, up, I got it.

720
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:44,653
- Okay.
- No second thoughts.

721
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:46,289
No. No, no,
no, no.

722
00:32:46,291 --> 00:32:47,990
- Get up here!
- I had a glass of champagne.

723
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,359
- Harlan, listen to me.
- We are...

724
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,161
- It's late. I had...
- You've only had one glass.

725
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:52,795
Exactly. A glass of champagne.
I don't...

726
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:55,198
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

727
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,233
Can you just take your goddamn
medicine and go to bed?

728
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:59,668
If you're gonna put that
vile shit in me,

729
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,836
you have to earn it.

730
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:02,638
On my birthday.

731
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,039
- Oh, God.
- Eighty-fifth birthday.

732
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,942
- Fine. Jesus!
- I'm so old.

733
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,112
- I'm so old.
- You really love drama, huh?

734
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:10,313
Oh, Marta.

735
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:12,215
Okay, let's do this.
Nine-by-nine.

736
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,349
- Right.
- You ready?

737
00:33:13,351 --> 00:33:15,017
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

738
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:16,319
Yeah. Yeah.

739
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:17,621
How dare you.

740
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:21,792
I know how this is gonna end.

741
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:24,793
What is that?

742
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,895
Why can't I beat you
at this game?

743
00:33:26,897 --> 00:33:28,098
Because I'm not playing
to beat you.

744
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,731
I'm playing to build
a beautiful pattern.

745
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,134
That's elder abuse.

746
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,835
I'm gonna call the AARP.

747
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:34,437
Don't make me
get the belt, <i>abuelo.</i>

748
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,073
It's basically over.

749
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,311
My only hope is that
an earthquake will strike.

750
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:41,979
But what are the chances?

751
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,046
Uh-oh.

752
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,915
Hello?

753
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,418
Hello? Hello?

754
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,987
Hello? Get under a door frame!

755
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:51,755
Yes!

756
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,762
Such a bad loser you are!
Meds, then bed.

757
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,731
I'm done with you.

758
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,135
That's fair.

759
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,803
Walt is smoking
that filthy cigar

760
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:08,971
out there on the porch.

761
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:10,941
Dead and nasty things.

762
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:14,042
How was tonight?

763
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:16,281
Tonight was, uh, good.

764
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:18,314
Oh, yeah?

765
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:20,316
I know you weren't looking
forward to it.

766
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:21,852
No. But I did it.

767
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,922
I cut the line on
all four of 'em.

768
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:27,259
Yeah.

769
00:34:27,992 --> 00:34:29,225
Wasn't easy.

770
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:30,792
Mmm.

771
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,330
This goddamn fortune.

772
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:35,964
You know, sometimes I think

773
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:38,000
that everything I've
given my family,

774
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:40,370
I've done maybe

775
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:43,807
without knowing, or maybe
to keep them beneath me.

776
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:47,343
I certainly should have...

777
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:50,480
I don't know,
encouraged Walt

778
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:52,950
to write his own stories,
not just be

779
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:55,984
a caretaker of mine.

780
00:34:55,986 --> 00:34:58,121
Like you said I should.

781
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:00,956
And then be a father
and not just a provider

782
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:03,759
for Joni, like you
also said.

783
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:06,362
And I could have been kinder
to Linda and Ransom...

784
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:09,499
Jesus! Ransom.

785
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:14,705
Oh, there's so much of me
in that kid.

786
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,409
Confident. Stupid.

787
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:21,211
I don't know, protected.

788
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:25,716
Playing life like a game,
without consequence.

789
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,853
Until you can't tell
the difference

790
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:32,390
between a stage prop

791
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:35,260
and a real knife.

792
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,062
You know, I don't
fear death.

793
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,963
But, oh, God,

794
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:44,400
I'd like to fix some
of this before I go.

795
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:46,504
Close the book
with a flourish.

796
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:52,141
I guess we'll see. Hmm?

797
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:53,378
I guess we will.

798
00:35:59,016 --> 00:36:00,483
Hey.

799
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:01,785
You had a long day.

800
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:04,021
You wanna do drugs?

801
00:36:04,556 --> 00:36:06,088
You mean the good stuff?

802
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,523
Yeah?

803
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:11,427
Oh, come on,
send me to la-la land.

804
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:13,996
Just a tiny bit, okay?

805
00:36:13,998 --> 00:36:17,200
Why did I wait till my mid-age
to become a morphine user?

806
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,067
What a schmuck.

807
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:21,337
What a nudnik.
This...

808
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,141
This stuff
is the best.

809
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:29,847
Oh, my God.

810
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:32,417
Is there a problem?

811
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,489
This is what I just gave you
100 milligrams of.

812
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:41,157
I messed up.

813
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,229
You gave me 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

814
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:50,600
Excuse me, what is the good
stuff's dosage supposed to be?

815
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,934
Let's not call it that
right now, okay?

816
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:54,036
Three milligrams.

817
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:55,206
Oh, that's much less.

818
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,540
So what happens?

819
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,176
I'm gonna give you
an emergency shot of Naloxone,

820
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:01,977
so you don't die
in 10 minutes.

821
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:03,214
Oh, well, no pressure.

822
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:06,516
You know, this is
an interesting

823
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:09,152
and efficient
method of murder.

824
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:11,187
I need to write this down.

825
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:14,923
So, if someone switched
the meds on purpose,

826
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,394
I'd be dead in 10 minutes.

827
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:19,295
- Like stone-cold dead?
- Yes.

828
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:20,896
You'll feel symptoms in five.

829
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:23,499
Sweats, disorientation,
and then...

830
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:27,103
Yes. That big dose injected,
within 10, your...

831
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:29,339
Your brain...

832
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:31,140
Yes, 10 minutes.

833
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:32,542
From the moment of injection?

834
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,577
It's eight-ish now.

835
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,313
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance

836
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:38,980
when he first
felt the symptoms

837
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:42,385
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do,

838
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:46,356
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive

839
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,024
and it'd be too late.

840
00:37:49,026 --> 00:37:52,564
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

841
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,063
Marta?

842
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:59,702
- Do you have the Naxostuff?
- Yes, I'm gonna find it.

843
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:02,070
I have it because
it comes with the kit,

844
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,907
so it should be here.
It has to be.

845
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,410
It's like...

846
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,320
It's not here, Harlan.

847
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:19,355
I don't know why
it's not here.

848
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:21,024
So, I'm gonna
use the phone, okay?

849
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,128
To call an ambulance.

850
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:38,075
What are you doing?

851
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:41,146
What are you doing?

852
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,181
Marta, listen to me.

853
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:46,249
Harlan, I need to call
the ambulance.

854
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:47,350
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!

855
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:48,451
- They need to get here.
- There's no time!

856
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:49,519
- You have to...
- You have to listen!

857
00:38:49,521 --> 00:38:51,019
I'm calling the family!

858
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,692
What are you doing?

859
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,561
- Are you nuts?
- Don't make a noise.

860
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:00,196
- Harlan, we have to call the ambulance.
- Marta, listen to me!

861
00:39:00,198 --> 00:39:01,264
We don't have time!

862
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:02,465
- What's going on?
- Listen to me!

863
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,434
Now, if what you said
is true, I'm gone.

864
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:05,568
There's no saving me.

865
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,636
No, no.

866
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,069
We have six minutes.

867
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:09,305
- No, I can't...
- Wait, no.

868
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:11,140
We have got to get you
out of this!

869
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:12,510
Think of your mom.

870
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,177
My mom?

871
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:17,447
Marta, get behind me,
get behind me.

872
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:18,583
Don't make a noise.

873
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:20,585
Harlan?

874
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:22,652
Marta?

875
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,287
Everything all right?

876
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:26,789
- Oh, hi, Joni.
- I thought I... Hi.

877
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,791
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

878
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:30,726
No, no.
We're fine. We're fine.

879
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:34,697
Well, I just knocked over this Go board.
Sorry about that.

880
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:36,732
- Everyone's all right?
- Yeah, fine.

881
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:39,235
No, no.
Go to bed, Joni.

882
00:39:39,237 --> 00:39:40,803
Okay.

883
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:43,306
Maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the family...

884
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:44,674
Tomorrow's fine.

885
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,612
- Goodnight. Love you. 'Night.
- Love you. Bye.

886
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:52,150
Come on.

887
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:54,686
Pay attention, now.

888
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:57,153
Your mom

889
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:59,087
is still undocumented.

890
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,523
And if this is your fault,

891
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:03,226
she'll be found out
and at best deported

892
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:05,294
and your family
will be broken.

893
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:08,397
We're not gonna let that
happen, are we, huh?

894
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:11,400
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

895
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:13,538
Will you do this,
Marta? Hmm?

896
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,006
This last thing

897
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:17,840
for me?

898
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:19,042
For your family?

899
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:23,915
What do you want me to do?

900
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,818
<i>Go downstairs
as noisily as you can</i>

901
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,453
<i>and then say goodbye loudly.</i>

902
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:31,521
Walt, I'm leaving.

903
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:33,122
<i>Call attention
to the time...</i>

904
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,423
God, it's midnight already.

905
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:35,493
<i>If you can.</i>

906
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:38,594
<i>Drive out the gate.</i>

907
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:40,563
<i>Then to avoid
the security cameras,</i>

908
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,601
<i>pull off the road before
the carved elephant.</i>

909
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,669
Wait.
Was it before or after?

910
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:48,437
<i>After the carved elephant.</i>

911
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:50,239
No, he said before.
Was it?

912
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,241
<i>Beafterfore
the carved elephant.</i>

913
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:53,344
Oh, shit.

914
00:40:56,781 --> 00:41:01,350
<i>Park, and come back
on foot up to the house.</i>

915
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:05,154
<i>Take the side yard pass
through the little gate.</i>

916
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:07,523
<i>The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.</i>

917
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:11,260
<i>You've got to get up
to the third floor</i>

918
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:12,461
<i>without being seen.</i>

919
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:14,864
<i>And the only way
is to climb the side trellis</i>

920
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:17,867
<i>and come in through
the trick hall window.</i>

921
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:19,268
You gotta be kidding me.

922
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,337
<i>I am not. Do it.</i>

923
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,915
<i>And for God's sake,
don't make any noise!</i>

924
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:46,195
<i>Once you're inside,
now this is the tricky part...</i>

925
00:41:46,197 --> 00:41:47,630
<i>This is the tricky part?</i>

926
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:50,866
<i>Get my robe and cap
from my bedroom</i>

927
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:52,435
<i>and put them on.</i>

928
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:53,469
<i>Harlan...</i>

929
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:55,571
This is crazy.
I don't think I can do that.

930
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:57,373
No, we need to make this
so airtight

931
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,307
that the average cop

932
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,843
will entirely dismiss you
as a suspect.

933
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:03,247
It sounds crazy,
but it'll work.

934
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:10,622
<i>Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you</i>

935
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,289
<i>through the glazed window.</i>

936
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,393
Dad? Go back to bed.

937
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:18,361
<i>You were seen leaving.</i>

938
00:42:18,363 --> 00:42:21,364
<i>The security cameras
show you driving off.</i>

939
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:22,565
<i>And 20 minutes later,</i>

940
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:25,568
<i>I'm seen alive and well
by my son.</i>

941
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,602
<i>You see,</i>

942
00:42:26,604 --> 00:42:29,238
<i>you've gone from suspect
number one</i>

943
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,906
<i>to an impossibility.</i>

944
00:42:30,908 --> 00:42:32,808
<i>Leave the way you came</i>

945
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,647
<i>and don't be seen.</i>

946
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:47,525
Ransom?

947
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:51,295
Are you back
again already?

948
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,499
<i>Drive home.</i>

949
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:58,601
<i>And sometime
in the next few days</i>

950
00:42:58,603 --> 00:43:00,736
<i>the police will question you.</i>

951
00:43:00,738 --> 00:43:03,506
No. No, no, no. No!

952
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:05,441
I can't lie!

953
00:43:05,443 --> 00:43:07,443
You know I can't lie!
I'll puke!

954
00:43:07,445 --> 00:43:10,279
Well, then don't lie.
Tell fragments of the truth.

955
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,714
In this exact order.

956
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:20,425
I took him upstairs.

957
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:23,761
We played our nightly
game of Go.

958
00:43:25,596 --> 00:43:27,997
At some point,
he knocked the board over

959
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:31,202
and Joni came up
to check on us.

960
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:32,970
Um...

961
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:36,474
I gave him pain medication.

962
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:39,944
He pulled his shoulder
last week.

963
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:41,544
Um...

964
00:43:41,546 --> 00:43:43,881
And I left him
in his study.

965
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:45,881
At midnight

966
00:43:45,883 --> 00:43:47,285
I said goodbye
to Walt,

967
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:50,419
went home.

968
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:52,590
What kind of medication
did you give him?

969
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,727
Since his injury,
I've been giving him

970
00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:00,896
a 100 milligram IV push
of Toradol.

971
00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:03,299
It's a non-narcotic analgesic.

972
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,034
And to help him sleep,

973
00:44:05,036 --> 00:44:07,636
three milligrams
of morphine.

974
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:09,505
And the family
was aware of this?

975
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:10,840
Yes, of course.

976
00:44:10,842 --> 00:44:13,008
Did you notice
anything strange

977
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,712
or off about his demeanor?

978
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,617
No.

979
00:44:23,488 --> 00:44:25,556
Well, that sounds
about right.

980
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:28,760
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

981
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:49,612
Hey, sis, people are
gonna start getting here

982
00:44:49,614 --> 00:44:50,913
for the memorial pretty soon.

983
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:51,916
Are you...

984
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:56,619
Are you all right?

985
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:58,923
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

986
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,593
This all feels like one.

987
00:45:03,594 --> 00:45:06,063
Like something he'd write,
not do.

988
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:09,934
I keep waiting for
the big reveal.

989
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:14,069
Where it'll make sense.

990
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:15,640
Wouldn't that be nice?

991
00:45:16,774 --> 00:45:17,909
Oh, Walt.

992
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:22,914
<i>I don't think
he killed himself.</i>

993
00:45:23,648 --> 00:45:25,714
I don't. I really don't.

994
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:27,383
There's this
Hallmark movie

995
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:29,685
called <i>Deadly by Surprise</i>
with Danica McKellar.

996
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:31,121
And in it, she plays
this wife

997
00:45:31,123 --> 00:45:33,556
who's getting poisoned
by her husband,

998
00:45:33,558 --> 00:45:35,158
but he's doing it
little by little,

999
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,126
so she doesn't know it

1000
00:45:36,128 --> 00:45:38,861
and she goes crazy,
and she kills herself.

1001
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,729
And my cousin,
who's a receptionist

1002
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,498
at the medical
examiner's office,

1003
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,533
she says that stuff
totally happens.

1004
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:46,068
It's not even 3% as crazy

1005
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,736
as the stuff she's seen
come through there.

1006
00:45:47,738 --> 00:45:48,840
So, I'm just like...

1007
00:45:50,408 --> 00:45:52,007
Oh, God, yeah!

1008
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:54,177
I mean, don't like him
because you love him.

1009
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:57,046
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

1010
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:59,448
But maybe an asshole
is what we needed.

1011
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,016
Oh, my God, yeah,

1012
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:02,751
an asshole is what
Germany needed

1013
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:04,820
- in 1930-whatever.
- Here we go.

1014
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:06,789
Come on, Joni, those two
things don't even conflate.

1015
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,490
- There is the problem...
- Oh, Jesus.

1016
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:09,625
You do not care
about anybody's feelings...

1017
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:12,128
I'm gonna disappear until
the politics talk is done.

1018
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,530
- You, my friend...
- You want some champers?

1019
00:46:14,532 --> 00:46:16,432
I can't.
I'm technically working.

1020
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:18,168
Why don't you take off
your red cap, Richard,

1021
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,202
and look around you?

1022
00:46:19,204 --> 00:46:21,670
The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.

1023
00:46:21,672 --> 00:46:22,705
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1024
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:26,008
We are losing our way of life
and our culture.

1025
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,042
That's right.

1026
00:46:27,044 --> 00:46:28,744
There are millions
of Mexicans coming.

1027
00:46:28,746 --> 00:46:30,146
- Oh, God, really?
- Don't make this a race thing.

1028
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:31,747
You always make this
a race thing.

1029
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:33,116
- Yeah, this is not about race.
- I would say the same thing

1030
00:46:33,118 --> 00:46:34,550
if they were
European immigrants.

1031
00:46:34,552 --> 00:46:36,518
Oh, yeah? So, if the
Swiss were, like,

1032
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,554
- clogging in the streets...
- No. No, no, we allow them in

1033
00:46:38,556 --> 00:46:40,789
and they think
they own what's ours.

1034
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:42,992
They're putting children
in cages!

1035
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:44,160
- I mean, these are camps!
- Yes.

1036
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:45,527
Come on, Joni,

1037
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:46,996
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

1038
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:48,931
but the parents have
some blame here.

1039
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:51,667
Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?

1040
00:46:51,669 --> 00:46:54,237
- Isn't that what America is...
- For breaking the law!

1041
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:55,171
My God.

1042
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:56,038
And you're gonna
hate hearing this,

1043
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,741
but it's true,
America is for Americans.

1044
00:46:58,743 --> 00:46:59,975
Don't point at me.

1045
00:46:59,977 --> 00:47:01,144
Where's Marta?
Is she still here?

1046
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:02,678
- Oh, God, don't.
- Marta!

1047
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,979
- Come on over.
- No, Richard.

1048
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:05,248
Come on over, Marta.
Please, come over.

1049
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,515
You're shitting me.

1050
00:47:06,517 --> 00:47:07,883
Marta,

1051
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:11,854
your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

1052
00:47:11,856 --> 00:47:14,257
I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.

1053
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:15,626
She did it the right way.

1054
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:17,693
You work hard,

1055
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:20,496
and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.

1056
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,898
Just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

1057
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,833
And I'll bet you
agree with me, right?

1058
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:27,103
Oh, just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

1059
00:47:27,105 --> 00:47:29,705
It's okay! I just wanna
hear what she has to say!

1060
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:30,839
It's okay, Marta,
you can speak.

1061
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:32,175
Oh, sweetheart,
don't feel pressure to answer.

1062
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:33,809
- This is just a...
- Look...

1063
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:34,910
- Please don't.
- If you wanna

1064
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:36,679
become an American,

1065
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:39,115
there are legal
ways to do it.

1066
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,649
But if you break the law,

1067
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:43,085
it doesn't matter
how good your heart is,

1068
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:45,921
you gotta face
the consequences!

1069
00:47:45,923 --> 00:47:47,556
Are you goddamn insane?

1070
00:47:47,558 --> 00:47:49,760
- It's done.
- Hey! I'm warning you.

1071
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:56,799
That's when I ask her,
I'm like,

1072
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:57,967
"Tonya, what is wrong
with people?"

1073
00:47:57,969 --> 00:47:59,668
Literally.

1074
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,037
Oh, my God!
Marta, what?

1075
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,539
Marta?

1076
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:04,673
What's the matter?

1077
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,875
Whoa, whoa.
Hey. Breathe.

1078
00:48:06,877 --> 00:48:09,878
- Oh, my gosh.
- Marta, are you okay?

1079
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,117
Hey, Fran, do you still
have your stash?

1080
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:19,088
Take 'em whenever
you need 'em.

1081
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,724
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

1082
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:23,093
Thanks, Fran.

1083
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:24,994
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1084
00:48:24,996 --> 00:48:26,096
- No, just... No, stop...
- I'm sorry.

1085
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:27,596
I'm just very, very sorry.

1086
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,199
Stop saying
you're sorry. Jesus!

1087
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:31,334
I hate this. Oh, God,
my heart won't stop...

1088
00:48:31,336 --> 00:48:32,601
I can't...

1089
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:35,740
It's just everything...
No, thank you.

1090
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:40,676
That's where Fran
keeps her stash?

1091
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,714
Who's gonna
open a clock?

1092
00:48:45,283 --> 00:48:47,317
Do you want
dinner, Nana?

1093
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:49,651
Dinner? To eat?

1094
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:51,653
- To eat?
- Walt?

1095
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:53,123
- Nana?
- Walt, Walt, she's fine.

1096
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,227
She ate the entire
salmon spread already.

1097
00:48:57,095 --> 00:48:59,862
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

1098
00:48:59,864 --> 00:49:01,764
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

1099
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:03,966
Yes. Yes, a very good
time, right now.

1100
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:05,301
Oh, okay.

1101
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:07,239
All right. Calm down.

1102
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,207
Marta,

1103
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:13,811
we've been
talking it over and, uh...

1104
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,047
- Have you been smoking grass?
- No.

1105
00:49:18,049 --> 00:49:20,015
- Mmm-hmm.
- Come on.

1106
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:21,784
Marta, we've been
talking it over,

1107
00:49:21,786 --> 00:49:24,220
and, uh,
the whole family,

1108
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:26,124
we'd like to take
care of you.

1109
00:49:27,825 --> 00:49:28,926
What does that mean?

1110
00:49:30,128 --> 00:49:32,162
We all think that
you deserve something.

1111
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:34,763
Financially,
we'd like to help you out.

1112
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:36,734
You were never anything
but good to Dad

1113
00:49:37,835 --> 00:49:39,570
and because of that we...

1114
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:41,806
You can count on us.

1115
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,109
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

1116
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:48,811
I thought you should've been
at the funeral,

1117
00:49:48,813 --> 00:49:50,781
by the way, I was outvoted.

1118
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:02,760
Detective.

1119
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:05,163
You're still here?

1120
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:07,898
Mmm.

1121
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:13,669
Did you know Harlan?

1122
00:50:13,671 --> 00:50:14,937
He knew my father,

1123
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:17,007
who was a police detective
years ago.

1124
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,142
Oh.

1125
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:21,078
My father
respected Harlan.

1126
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,745
That says quite a lot.

1127
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:25,082
Is that why
you're here?

1128
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:28,218
Here now, here?

1129
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,320
No.

1130
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:32,656
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

1131
00:50:38,028 --> 00:50:41,031
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

1132
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,032
I know it.

1133
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:46,070
I believe you know it, too.

1134
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:49,207
So you're gonna keep digging?

1135
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:53,909
Harlan's detectives,
they dig.

1136
00:50:53,911 --> 00:50:56,112
They riffle and root.

1137
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:57,349
Truffle pigs.

1138
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:03,121
I anticipate the terminus
of <i>Gravity's Rainbow.</i>

1139
00:51:03,954 --> 00:51:05,123
<i>Gravity's Rainbow?</i>

1140
00:51:05,756 --> 00:51:07,055
It's a novel.

1141
00:51:07,057 --> 00:51:08,891
Yeah, I know.

1142
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:11,261
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

1143
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:12,328
Nobody has.

1144
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,797
But I like the title.

1145
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:16,932
It describes
the path of a projectile

1146
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,335
determined by natural law.

1147
00:51:19,337 --> 00:51:21,870
<i>Et voila,</i> my method.

1148
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:23,206
I observe the facts

1149
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:26,041
without biases
of the head or heart.

1150
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:28,043
I determine the arc's path,

1151
00:51:28,045 --> 00:51:30,779
stroll leisurely
to its terminus

1152
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:33,318
and the truth
falls at my feet.

1153
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:39,189
The medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide,

1154
00:51:39,191 --> 00:51:42,227
but Elliott agreed to keep it
pending for 48 hours.

1155
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:43,959
Tomorrow morning,

1156
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:45,794
I search the grounds
and the house,

1157
00:51:45,796 --> 00:51:46,931
begin my investigation.

1158
00:51:47,998 --> 00:51:50,166
I want you to be
by my side for it.

1159
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:51,767
- What?
- My confidante.

1160
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:52,868
My eyes and ears.

1161
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,803
Hey. Wait, wait,
Detective. Why me?

1162
00:51:54,805 --> 00:51:57,275
I trust your kind heart.

1163
00:51:59,177 --> 00:52:00,176
Also, you're the only one

1164
00:52:00,178 --> 00:52:02,280
who had nothing to gain
from Harlan's death.

1165
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:05,015
So how about it, Watson?

1166
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,250
Hey, Detective?

1167
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:09,454
If you want my insight
into the family...

1168
00:52:10,854 --> 00:52:12,290
None of them are murderers.

1169
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,224
That's my insight.

1170
00:52:14,226 --> 00:52:15,458
And yet,

1171
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,528
be it cruel or comforting,

1172
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,167
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

1173
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,802
That's what it does.

1174
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,272
Always?

1175
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,507
Tomorrow at 8:00.

1176
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:02,070
<i>I know
I've missed something.</i>

1177
00:53:02,072 --> 00:53:03,239
<i>There's gonna be something
I missed.</i>

1178
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:05,275
- <i>Harlan.
- But I know you can do this.</i>

1179
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:06,342
<i>No, I can't.</i>

1180
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:07,909
Without losing your soul,

1181
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:09,178
you have to do
what you have to do...

1182
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,580
- No.
- To beat this and win.

1183
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:12,014
Harlan, I can't.

1184
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:14,018
- You can. And you have to.
- No.

1185
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:16,053
For me.

1186
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,789
Right now!

1187
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:39,511
Harlan, I have to
get you help.

1188
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:42,347
You do as I say

1189
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:45,949
and everything
will be just fine.

1190
00:53:46,284 --> 00:53:48,184
No. No.

1191
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:49,321
I promise.

1192
00:53:50,322 --> 00:53:51,387
But...

1193
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:03,493
Fifty years ago,
I worked this estate.

1194
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:06,462
You know, security back then
was such that

1195
00:55:06,464 --> 00:55:10,099
you had to make
the rounds with a 94

1196
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:13,034
and keep your ears open.

1197
00:55:13,036 --> 00:55:17,440
Now you've got
all this modern technology.

1198
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,675
Now, that's
the video there.

1199
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:22,478
I saved the tape
from that night.

1200
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,115
Normally, I erase 'em
with a magnetic degausser,

1201
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:29,252
but in this case, I thought
I'd just save it, you know?

1202
00:55:29,254 --> 00:55:31,019
For security.

1203
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:33,491
Now, uh,
that's a live feed there.

1204
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:37,193
<i>To avoid
the security cameras,</i>

1205
00:55:37,195 --> 00:55:39,995
<i>pull off the road
after the carved elephant.</i>

1206
00:55:39,997 --> 00:55:42,131
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

1207
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,065
Well, of course you can.

1208
00:55:44,067 --> 00:55:46,302
I recorded it SSLP.

1209
00:55:46,304 --> 00:55:48,204
There's eight hours
in that tape.

1210
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:50,341
9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

1211
00:56:00,017 --> 00:56:02,083
Looks like
a Japanese horror movie.

1212
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:04,387
You think we could
scan forward on that?

1213
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:05,755
Are we all gonna die
in seven days?

1214
00:56:05,757 --> 00:56:07,156
How can we scan forward?

1215
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:09,659
Oh, yeah, just hold
the play button down

1216
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:13,063
and press FF
until you hear it grind.

1217
00:56:19,537 --> 00:56:21,137
All right.
Should be coming up now

1218
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:22,574
to the time
when the party ended.

1219
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:27,477
What happened?

1220
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:30,078
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

1221
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,215
That thing eats tapes
like popcorn.

1222
00:56:32,217 --> 00:56:34,317
You think your guys
can digitize this

1223
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,751
so we could scan it properly?

1224
00:56:35,753 --> 00:56:37,121
Yeah,
I think we can do that.

1225
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:39,290
I got it.

1226
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:42,758
You know,
all these statues

1227
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,826
that you see around here?

1228
00:56:43,828 --> 00:56:45,361
They're all straight out
of the series,

1229
00:56:45,363 --> 00:56:47,296
<i>The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.</i>

1230
00:56:47,298 --> 00:56:49,298
- Pretty cool.
- Awesome.

1231
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,700
Yeah.

1232
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:53,135
Benny,
it's beautiful out here,

1233
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:55,070
but do you really think
someone broke into the house

1234
00:56:55,072 --> 00:56:56,739
and murdered Harlan?
Is that why we're out here?

1235
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,608
Oh, it is unlikely,

1236
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:01,310
but if they did,
there will be traces.

1237
00:57:01,312 --> 00:57:03,481
- Uh, I can hang on to that.
- Yeah.

1238
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:14,323
Hey, Wagner,
you got any luck on...

1239
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:17,326
- Uh, what's-his-name?
- Ransom?

1240
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:19,197
- Yeah.
- No.

1241
00:57:20,465 --> 00:57:21,864
Did get an
address though.

1242
00:57:21,866 --> 00:57:24,736
- Yeah?
- 10 Kenoak Street.

1243
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,637
Ken... Kenoak?

1244
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:29,207
- Uh-huh.
- Kenoak.

1245
00:57:30,508 --> 00:57:32,477
It's a pleasant thing
to say, isn't it?

1246
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:34,343
Kenoak.

1247
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:36,812
I awoke amid Kenoak.

1248
00:57:36,814 --> 00:57:38,648
That's funny. Ken-oh-kia.

1249
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,349
All these leaves and mud,

1250
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,852
they're really gonna do
a number on my boots, man.

1251
00:57:42,854 --> 00:57:46,188
Mud. Did it rain
the past week?

1252
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,623
- No, stay there!
- What?

1253
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,758
Whoa!

1254
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,892
Okay.

1255
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:51,827
We got footprints here,
so, uh...

1256
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,298
- Oh.
- I wanna, um...

1257
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,398
Marta...

1258
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,732
- Stop.
- What?

1259
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:57,900
- Um...
- What?

1260
00:57:57,902 --> 00:57:59,368
Marta, stay there.

1261
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,537
- What?
- No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.

1262
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:02,905
- No! No!
- I couldn't hear. If you...

1263
00:58:02,907 --> 00:58:04,173
- Did you call me?
- All right.

1264
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:05,241
- All right.
- Excuse me.

1265
00:58:05,243 --> 00:58:06,208
- All right.
- Come here.

1266
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,743
Wagner, we're gonna
need to call the boys,

1267
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:08,811
have 'em come down here,

1268
00:58:08,813 --> 00:58:09,679
take a look
at all these tracks.

1269
00:58:09,681 --> 00:58:11,514
Get it taped off.
Stay on that side.

1270
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:12,715
- I'm sorry.
- Watch out. Watch out.

1271
00:58:12,717 --> 00:58:14,285
Okay.

1272
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:16,387
Hey! Yeah!

1273
00:58:17,288 --> 00:58:18,754
Hussie? Hussie, hey.

1274
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:22,858
Best judge of character
is a dog.

1275
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,827
- Good boy.
- I've found that to be true.

1276
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:30,635
Yes!

1277
00:58:31,235 --> 00:58:32,835
My puppies!

1278
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:33,903
- Yes.
- Yeah, well,

1279
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:37,340
they've got plans to read
the will at around 10:00,

1280
00:58:37,342 --> 00:58:39,210
so, the whole family
will be here soon.

1281
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:43,312
I've never been
to a will reading.

1282
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:44,714
Oh, well...

1283
00:58:44,716 --> 00:58:47,483
You think it'd be
like a game show,

1284
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:49,652
but think of a community
theater production

1285
00:58:49,654 --> 00:58:51,356
of a tax return.

1286
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,824
So, what are we
looking for?

1287
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:55,825
Oh, you know,

1288
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:59,295
anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

1289
00:58:59,297 --> 00:59:01,430
You'll know it
when you see it.

1290
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:02,700
Oh, my God.

1291
00:59:04,202 --> 00:59:05,570
Sweet beans!

1292
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:10,775
Well...

1293
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:13,378
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1294
00:59:22,387 --> 00:59:24,255
You think you could
handle the study?

1295
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:36,565
Where's your medical bag?

1296
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:38,734
I don't know.
I left it here.

1297
00:59:38,736 --> 00:59:40,436
I always leave it here
with Harlan at night.

1298
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:41,871
They must have taken
it in as evidence.

1299
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:43,472
I'll look
into that.

1300
00:59:43,474 --> 00:59:44,607
Mmm.

1301
00:59:48,946 --> 00:59:50,381
Shit.

1302
00:59:52,817 --> 00:59:55,618
How'd the Go board
get knocked over?

1303
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,321
We were just
goofing around.

1304
00:59:58,956 --> 01:00:00,258
What are you thinking?

1305
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,241
No! No, no, no!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1306
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:19,675
Oh, let me guess.

1307
01:00:19,677 --> 01:00:21,746
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1308
01:00:22,513 --> 01:00:23,548
Stop. Stop.

1309
01:00:24,649 --> 01:00:26,849
Hugh Drysdale?

1310
01:00:26,851 --> 01:00:29,752
Ransom. Call me Ransom,
it's my middle name.

1311
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:31,355
Only the help
calls me Hugh.

1312
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:33,389
Okay.

1313
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:34,957
Uh, this is
Trooper Wagner.

1314
01:00:34,959 --> 01:00:36,992
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

1315
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:38,696
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

1316
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,801
Excuse me?

1317
01:00:44,836 --> 01:00:46,368
Sir?

1318
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,837
We're officers
of the law!

1319
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,905
You gonna run me in?
I don't feel like talking.

1320
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:51,540
I'm distraught.

1321
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:53,876
Hey, Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

1322
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:55,377
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

1323
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:56,447
Mr. Drysdale.

1324
01:00:57,448 --> 01:00:59,283
CSI KFC?

1325
01:01:04,322 --> 01:01:05,721
Hey, Frannie,

1326
01:01:05,723 --> 01:01:07,389
how about a glass
of cold milk?

1327
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:08,758
Hey, asshole.

1328
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,459
Not her name,
not her job.

1329
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:13,796
Hey, Meg.
How's the SJW degree coming?

1330
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:16,601
- Trust fund prick.
- All right, guys.

1331
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:18,367
Hey.

1332
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:20,569
Hey. Everyone...

1333
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:22,838
I'm just gonna be
in the other room, setting up.

1334
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,342
Be ready in 10 minutes.

1335
01:01:30,414 --> 01:01:32,348
Funny, Ransom,
you skipped the funeral,

1336
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:33,985
but you're early
for the will reading.

1337
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:38,053
Okay, people grieve
in different ways.

1338
01:01:38,055 --> 01:01:39,054
Let's not...

1339
01:01:39,056 --> 01:01:40,756
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

1340
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:42,057
Why are you even bothering?

1341
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:43,692
That's what
I'm asking myself.

1342
01:01:43,694 --> 01:01:45,361
What's that supposed to mean?

1343
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:47,463
He knows what it's
supposed to mean.

1344
01:01:47,465 --> 01:01:48,866
Wait... Walt, what?

1345
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:53,838
Jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party.

1346
01:01:55,573 --> 01:01:57,573
Oh,
that's where you were all night?

1347
01:01:57,575 --> 01:01:58,874
What the hell
were you doing

1348
01:01:58,876 --> 01:02:00,143
in the bathroom all night?

1349
01:02:00,145 --> 01:02:02,011
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

1350
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:03,078
No, I was not.

1351
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,380
Alt-right troll.

1352
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:05,447
Liberal snowflake.

1353
01:02:05,449 --> 01:02:07,117
I don't know what
any of that means.

1354
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,884
It means your son's
a little creep.

1355
01:02:08,886 --> 01:02:09,952
Oh!

1356
01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:11,554
My son's a creep?

1357
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:12,855
Guys, just...

1358
01:02:12,857 --> 01:02:14,456
Walt, he was
in the bathroom.

1359
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:15,891
Yeah, he was
in the bathroom.

1360
01:02:15,893 --> 01:02:18,696
Joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

1361
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:21,497
You know what, Richard?

1362
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:22,565
You wanna go?

1363
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:24,167
You bet, skippy, let's go.

1364
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:25,601
You wanna go?
Come on!

1365
01:02:25,603 --> 01:02:26,969
You better
watch out, man.

1366
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:28,571
- Walt, stop it right now!
- Son of a bitch!

1367
01:02:28,573 --> 01:02:29,638
- Stop it! Just stop!
- Stop it!

1368
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,673
Let go!
Let go, Richard!

1369
01:02:30,675 --> 01:02:32,541
I have been waiting
for this my whole life!

1370
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,743
- Stop it, right now!
- Donna, I can handle myself!

1371
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:36,078
- Stop it!
- I can handle it.

1372
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,479
Oh, my God.

1373
01:02:37,481 --> 01:02:39,782
We gotta do this more often.

1374
01:02:39,784 --> 01:02:40,785
Hey!

1375
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:42,585
Jacob.

1376
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:44,453
We know
where this is going.

1377
01:02:44,455 --> 01:02:46,555
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

1378
01:02:46,557 --> 01:02:48,124
where he had the fight
with Ransom.

1379
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:49,758
Now, you heard something.

1380
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,895
Spill it.

1381
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,864
I just heard two things.

1382
01:02:58,203 --> 01:02:59,403
...my will.

1383
01:02:59,737 --> 01:03:00,771
"My will."

1384
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:04,041
And then there was more yelling.

1385
01:03:05,076 --> 01:03:07,078
And then I heard Ransom say...

1386
01:03:08,146 --> 01:03:09,547
"I'm warning you."

1387
01:03:13,584 --> 01:03:15,118
Ransom...

1388
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,019
What's that mean?

1389
01:03:17,021 --> 01:03:19,521
I think it means our father
finally came to his senses

1390
01:03:19,523 --> 01:03:22,892
and cut this worthless
little brat out of his will.

1391
01:03:22,894 --> 01:03:25,494
So I guess you're gonna have
to sell the Beemer

1392
01:03:25,496 --> 01:03:27,496
and give your notice
at the country club,

1393
01:03:27,498 --> 01:03:29,798
and kick whatever
fashion drug you're on.

1394
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,033
Because if you think

1395
01:03:31,035 --> 01:03:33,035
that after all the bridges
you've burned,

1396
01:03:33,037 --> 01:03:34,069
after all the
shit you said,

1397
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:36,839
after everything that
you put this family through

1398
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:38,073
for the last 10 years,

1399
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:40,509
that any of us
are gonna support you

1400
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:42,611
that any of us
are gonna give you,

1401
01:03:42,613 --> 01:03:44,580
like Dad liked to say,

1402
01:03:44,582 --> 01:03:46,882
"a single red dime..."

1403
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:48,184
you're nuts!

1404
01:03:49,754 --> 01:03:50,855
Wow.

1405
01:03:52,657 --> 01:03:53,758
Son...

1406
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,259
Father.

1407
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:58,261
Did Harlan tell you

1408
01:03:58,263 --> 01:04:00,064
he was gonna cut you
out of the will?

1409
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:02,967
Yep.

1410
01:04:06,138 --> 01:04:08,238
Well, then he's done

1411
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,574
what none of us were
strong enough to do.

1412
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:15,147
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

1413
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:19,014
This might be the best thing

1414
01:04:19,016 --> 01:04:20,749
that could
ever happen to you.

1415
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:23,219
Thank you. My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

1416
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:25,921
Look, this is not
gonna be easy for you,

1417
01:04:25,923 --> 01:04:27,523
but it'll be good.

1418
01:04:27,525 --> 01:04:29,194
Nothing good is ever easy.

1419
01:04:29,927 --> 01:04:31,127
Up your ass, Joni.

1420
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:33,296
You've had your teeth in this
family's tit for a long time.

1421
01:04:33,298 --> 01:04:35,597
"Up your ass"?
Oh, very nice.

1422
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,700
- Matter of fact, eat shit.
- Oh, my God, Ransom.

1423
01:04:37,702 --> 01:04:38,767
- What?
- How's that?

1424
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:40,069
Please do not
use that word

1425
01:04:40,071 --> 01:04:41,570
- in front of my son.
- In fact, eat shit. Eat shit.

1426
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:42,738
If I wasn't practicing...

1427
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:43,706
- Eat shit.
- You entitled prick!

1428
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:45,308
I would slap that
smug smile right off...

1429
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,776
- Definitely eat shit.
- ...of your goddamn face!

1430
01:04:47,778 --> 01:04:49,212
Eat shit.
You can all eat shit.

1431
01:04:51,615 --> 01:04:53,818
I'm not eating
one iota of shit!

1432
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:58,821
What was that about
will readings being boring?

1433
01:04:58,823 --> 01:05:00,923
The exception
that proves the rule.

1434
01:05:02,893 --> 01:05:04,595
Asshole.

1435
01:05:05,796 --> 01:05:07,997
"I'm warning you."

1436
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:10,200
Ransom said,
"I'm warning you."

1437
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:11,867
Well, you heard
Ransom in there.

1438
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:14,036
That's the kind of
thing he says.

1439
01:05:14,038 --> 01:05:15,706
You want this?
You want this?

1440
01:05:20,278 --> 01:05:22,114
What do we have here?

1441
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:31,687
This looks like
a relatively fresh break.

1442
01:05:31,689 --> 01:05:33,090
Yep. Right there.

1443
01:05:34,192 --> 01:05:35,657
Wait a minute.

1444
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:37,762
Well, that doesn't make sense.

1445
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,330
Where's that window?

1446
01:05:40,332 --> 01:05:42,731
How about some
more cookies, Hugh?

1447
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:44,635
- You want some more cookies?
- That's great. That's great.

1448
01:05:45,669 --> 01:05:47,137
Hey, maybe Harlan left you

1449
01:05:47,139 --> 01:05:50,041
a cold glass of milk
in his will. Asshole.

1450
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:54,045
Show me.
But stay off the carpet.

1451
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:10,859
It's the trick window

1452
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:13,062
from <i>A Kill For All Seasons.</i>

1453
01:06:13,064 --> 01:06:14,765
Trooper, here, will you?
Take this.

1454
01:06:24,942 --> 01:06:26,809
Hmm.

1455
01:06:26,811 --> 01:06:30,045
Traces of dried mud.

1456
01:06:30,047 --> 01:06:33,017
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

1457
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:35,151
Footprints?

1458
01:06:35,153 --> 01:06:37,052
No, just traces.

1459
01:06:37,054 --> 01:06:39,922
Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,

1460
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:43,159
this could have happened
at any time, right?

1461
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:45,197
No, that would
not explain this.

1462
01:06:46,897 --> 01:06:48,198
Analyze that mud.

1463
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,898
It will match
these traces.

1464
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:50,866
Take this to Jamie.

1465
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:51,967
And you will find
similar samples

1466
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:54,839
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house.

1467
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:56,939
On the night of the party,

1468
01:06:56,941 --> 01:06:59,942
somebody who did not want to
be heard climbing those steps,

1469
01:06:59,944 --> 01:07:01,677
went to a great deal of trouble

1470
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:03,381
to break into
Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1471
01:07:04,748 --> 01:07:07,219
The game is afoot,
eh, Watson?

1472
01:07:18,062 --> 01:07:21,197
Well, thank you all for
getting together like this.

1473
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:23,433
It isn't legally necessary,

1474
01:07:23,435 --> 01:07:24,933
but I thought because
you're all in town,

1475
01:07:24,935 --> 01:07:26,735
and some of you
are leaving soon...

1476
01:07:26,737 --> 01:07:27,803
Excuse me.

1477
01:07:27,805 --> 01:07:30,106
Uh, I'm sorry.

1478
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:33,176
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to gently request

1479
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:34,710
that you all stay in town

1480
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:37,147
until the investigation
is completed.

1481
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:39,047
Yeah, well,
he's gently requesting,

1482
01:07:39,049 --> 01:07:40,782
but I'm gonna have
to make that an order.

1483
01:07:40,784 --> 01:07:42,485
No one move until we
figure this all out.

1484
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:43,752
What?

1485
01:07:43,754 --> 01:07:44,953
Can we ask why?

1486
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:46,422
- Has something changed?
- No.

1487
01:07:46,424 --> 01:07:48,491
No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?

1488
01:07:48,493 --> 01:07:50,226
Mr. Stevens...

1489
01:07:50,228 --> 01:07:51,960
You may continue.

1490
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,231
Right. Well...

1491
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:55,298
The other reason I thought

1492
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,733
this gathering
would be, uh, beneficial

1493
01:07:57,735 --> 01:08:01,271
is because
Harlan altered his will

1494
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:02,905
a week before he died.

1495
01:08:02,907 --> 01:08:04,274
He sealed it.

1496
01:08:04,276 --> 01:08:06,875
He asked me not to
submit it to the courts

1497
01:08:06,877 --> 01:08:08,311
for probate
until after his death.

1498
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:11,247
So, if anyone is confused
about anything,

1499
01:08:11,249 --> 01:08:13,815
we're all together,
we can talk.

1500
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:15,984
Although I don't imagine
any of it

1501
01:08:15,986 --> 01:08:17,886
is going to be
that complicated.

1502
01:08:17,888 --> 01:08:19,955
Uh, Harlan's
assets included...

1503
01:08:19,957 --> 01:08:21,023
Um...

1504
01:08:21,025 --> 01:08:22,392
- The house.
- The house,

1505
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,059
which he owned outright.

1506
01:08:24,061 --> 01:08:25,128
Um...

1507
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,329
$60 million.

1508
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:29,132
Yes. $60 million
in various cash accounts

1509
01:08:29,134 --> 01:08:30,500
and investments.

1510
01:08:30,502 --> 01:08:32,103
And of course,

1511
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:34,137
the real asset,

1512
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:36,805
sole ownership
of Blood Like Wine,

1513
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:37,973
his publishing company.

1514
01:08:37,975 --> 01:08:41,544
He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes

1515
01:08:41,546 --> 01:08:43,248
and he wanted
that read first.

1516
01:08:46,184 --> 01:08:49,084
"Dearest Linda,
Walter, and Joni...

1517
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:51,987
"Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1518
01:08:51,989 --> 01:08:54,290
"No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion.

1519
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:56,092
"And its purpose
was not to sow

1520
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:57,793
"greater discord in the family,

1521
01:08:57,795 --> 01:08:59,462
"quite the opposite.

1522
01:08:59,464 --> 01:09:02,098
"Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness,

1523
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,499
"but do accept it,

1524
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:05,437
"it's for the best. Dad."

1525
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:19,115
Um...

1526
01:09:19,117 --> 01:09:22,851
Wow. Well, yeah,
not too complex at all.

1527
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:23,919
This will be quick.

1528
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:28,491
"I, Harlan Thrombey,
being of sound mind and body"

1529
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:31,527
and yada-yada-yada...

1530
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:34,197
"I hereby direct
that all my assets,

1531
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:35,931
"both liquid and otherwise...

1532
01:09:35,933 --> 01:09:39,404
"I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

1533
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:44,140
"My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing,

1534
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:47,009
"I leave in its entirety
to Marta Cabrera,

1535
01:09:47,011 --> 01:09:49,077
"the copyright
of its catalogue likewise

1536
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:51,915
"I leave in its entirety
to Marta Cabrera."

1537
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:57,155
What?

1538
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,424
Uh...

1539
01:10:01,426 --> 01:10:02,993
- What?
- No.

1540
01:10:04,028 --> 01:10:06,229
- That's not... That's... No.
- No.

1541
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:07,297
- That can't be.
- No.

1542
01:10:07,299 --> 01:10:08,398
Can I see that
please, Alan?

1543
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,865
- Yeah. It's right.
- Please.

1544
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:11,167
This can't be legal.

1545
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:12,602
It's right.

1546
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:14,304
- You know, he was...
- Oh, my God.

1547
01:10:14,306 --> 01:10:15,471
Aren't there safeguards...

1548
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:16,872
Alan, there's a mistake.

1549
01:10:16,874 --> 01:10:18,241
I don't know what to say.

1550
01:10:18,243 --> 01:10:19,542
We're his family, so...

1551
01:10:19,544 --> 01:10:21,009
It's not possible.

1552
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:23,078
Are there safeguards
against this?

1553
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,881
Right mind.
Something...

1554
01:10:25,883 --> 01:10:27,183
- You know...
- Alan, listen...

1555
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:28,384
- He was on medication.
- In his final days,

1556
01:10:28,386 --> 01:10:30,018
he was on a great deal
of medication.

1557
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,321
Morphine?
All right, morphine.

1558
01:10:31,323 --> 01:10:32,622
- I mean, I don't know.
- This is confusing.

1559
01:10:32,624 --> 01:10:34,457
- She seems like family...
- Alan, you can take...

1560
01:10:34,459 --> 01:10:36,125
- ...but she's not our family.
- ...this piece of paper

1561
01:10:36,127 --> 01:10:39,195
and shove it right up your
ass, and get out!

1562
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:40,663
And, you cops, too, out.

1563
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:42,198
- Linda?
- Out! Right now.

1564
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,567
- Hey, Linda?
- No, Richard, we need to talk.

1565
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:47,303
We need to fight this thing.
We're not going anywhere.

1566
01:10:47,305 --> 01:10:49,439
I said get out!

1567
01:10:49,441 --> 01:10:52,040
We are the Thrombeys,
God damn it!

1568
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:54,011
This is still our house!

1569
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:01,250
Hmm?

1570
01:11:01,252 --> 01:11:03,119
Oh, sorry.

1571
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:05,455
"Likewise the house
at 2 Deerborn Drive

1572
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:07,090
"and all
belongings therein,

1573
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:09,559
"I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1574
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:13,529
Oh, you little bitch!

1575
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:16,265
- You little bitch!
- Linda?

1576
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:17,400
Did you know about this?

1577
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:18,568
Were you in on this
from the beginning?

1578
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:19,569
- This is unbelievable!
- Easy.

1579
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:20,636
No, no, no! I just wanna know.
What were you...

1580
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:23,972
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

1581
01:11:23,974 --> 01:11:25,541
- "Boinking"?
- No, no, no.

1582
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:27,610
I think everybody just needs
to cool their jets.

1583
01:11:27,612 --> 01:11:30,213
You had sex with my grandpa,
you dirty anchor baby!

1584
01:11:30,215 --> 01:11:31,381
Now hold your horses.

1585
01:11:31,383 --> 01:11:33,149
And in the meantime,
I'd maybe run.

1586
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:34,584
Wait, wait, wait, Marta?

1587
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:36,119
Now,
would you please...

1588
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:37,453
- Ladies and gentlemen, please.
- Marta, talk to us.

1589
01:11:37,455 --> 01:11:39,288
Marta?

1590
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,390
Wait a minute.

1591
01:11:40,392 --> 01:11:42,158
I totally understand how
you must be feeling right now.

1592
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,526
- You cannot leave!
- You can talk to me.

1593
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:46,162
I don't know what to say.
I don't know.

1594
01:11:46,164 --> 01:11:48,097
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Marta, please...

1595
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:49,732
Marta, listen, darling...

1596
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:53,269
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

1597
01:11:53,271 --> 01:11:56,372
Guys, I'm also confused.
I need to think!

1598
01:11:56,374 --> 01:11:57,675
Marta! Are you listening?

1599
01:11:58,443 --> 01:12:00,008
I can't catch up!

1600
01:12:01,346 --> 01:12:02,678
- I understand. I understand.
- Richard! Open the door!

1601
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,614
Open up that door!

1602
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,249
- You are scaring her!
- I can't open the damn door!

1603
01:12:06,251 --> 01:12:08,184
Marta, go. Marta, go.

1604
01:12:08,186 --> 01:12:10,186
Marta,
you have to understand.

1605
01:12:10,188 --> 01:12:11,987
He is our father!

1606
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:13,389
Marta, listen to me.

1607
01:12:13,391 --> 01:12:15,291
Marta, don't listen
to them. I'm here.

1608
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:17,093
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1609
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:20,229
So DM me
on Instagram, okay?

1610
01:12:20,231 --> 01:12:21,499
I wanna talk to you.

1611
01:12:26,571 --> 01:12:28,069
Ransom!

1612
01:12:28,071 --> 01:12:29,505
What the hell's going on?

1613
01:12:29,507 --> 01:12:30,740
I think this could be
the best thing

1614
01:12:30,742 --> 01:12:32,277
to happen to all of you!

1615
01:12:34,379 --> 01:12:35,979
What does he
mean by that?

1616
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:39,215
Richard, why didn't
you stop her?

1617
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:40,450
What am I supposed to do?

1618
01:12:40,452 --> 01:12:42,085
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1619
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:54,666
Okay, seriously, though,
what the hell?

1620
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,537
Hey.
I'll take an extra bowl.

1621
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:02,805
Sure.

1622
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:11,079
You look like
you're gonna pass out.

1623
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:12,248
Have you eaten
anything today?

1624
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,251
Eat.

1625
01:13:17,455 --> 01:13:18,754
This is a nightmare.

1626
01:13:18,756 --> 01:13:20,391
Mmm-hmm.

1627
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:22,527
So why?

1628
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,264
- Why?
- Why?

1629
01:13:27,398 --> 01:13:31,501
Hey. This is everything.

1630
01:13:31,503 --> 01:13:33,536
There's gotta be a bigger reason
why, and you know it.

1631
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:34,604
Well, how about
it had to do more

1632
01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:36,107
with you guys
than with me?

1633
01:13:38,209 --> 01:13:40,243
Yeah.

1634
01:13:40,245 --> 01:13:42,247
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1635
01:13:47,485 --> 01:13:49,118
Did he tell you anything?

1636
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,720
Only that I wasn't
getting a cent.

1637
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:51,787
That's because
he wanted you

1638
01:13:51,789 --> 01:13:53,523
to build something from
the ground up like your mom.

1639
01:13:53,525 --> 01:13:54,624
"To build something
from the ground up."

1640
01:13:54,626 --> 01:13:56,526
Yeah, my mother built her
business from the ground up

1641
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:59,195
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1642
01:13:59,197 --> 01:14:02,131
My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.

1643
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:03,466
He lives in fear.

1644
01:14:03,468 --> 01:14:05,601
And I know that's what
my grandfather was trying

1645
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:07,136
to protect me from
by doing this

1646
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:08,671
and I know I shouldn't say
this out loud,

1647
01:14:08,673 --> 01:14:10,174
but when he told me, I...

1648
01:14:12,243 --> 01:14:13,311
Jesus.

1649
01:14:13,778 --> 01:14:15,146
I coulda killed him.

1650
01:14:17,482 --> 01:14:20,616
After I left the party though,
I was driving.

1651
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:23,488
Nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this, um...

1652
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:27,158
Clarity.

1653
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:29,292
Like, from here on out,

1654
01:14:29,294 --> 01:14:31,095
I was gonna have to
fend for myself.

1655
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:32,630
And that felt...

1656
01:14:34,632 --> 01:14:35,633
Good.

1657
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:38,503
The old bastard.

1658
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:44,674
Marta, I know
three things.

1659
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:45,741
One...

1660
01:14:45,743 --> 01:14:47,445
I know he didn't
commit suicide.

1661
01:14:49,814 --> 01:14:52,150
- What makes you think that?
- I don't think it.

1662
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:53,883
I know it.

1663
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:55,418
Because I knew my granddad.

1664
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,653
Maybe you and I were
the only two who knew him,

1665
01:14:57,655 --> 01:15:00,124
so you're not gonna bullshit me
on this because, two...

1666
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:03,459
I know lying makes you puke.

1667
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:06,729
'Cause of that mafia game
last Fourth of July.

1668
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:08,600
And three...

1669
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:11,100
I know you just ate

1670
01:15:11,102 --> 01:15:13,338
a full plate of baked beans
and sausage.

1671
01:15:16,374 --> 01:15:17,375
So...

1672
01:15:19,477 --> 01:15:20,812
Look me in the eye

1673
01:15:22,246 --> 01:15:24,349
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather.

1674
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:29,487
- You asshole.
- Marta,

1675
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:32,423
tell me everything.

1676
01:15:36,194 --> 01:15:37,960
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

1677
01:15:37,962 --> 01:15:39,261
No.

1678
01:15:39,263 --> 01:15:40,763
I don't know
how many times

1679
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:43,833
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1680
01:15:43,835 --> 01:15:47,203
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1681
01:15:47,205 --> 01:15:48,804
and we all
confirmed that he was...

1682
01:15:48,806 --> 01:15:50,406
Would a sound mind do this?

1683
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:51,641
How... Sound, how?

1684
01:15:51,643 --> 01:15:53,943
The very action
speaks to unsoundness.

1685
01:15:53,945 --> 01:15:55,413
Not legally. No.

1686
01:15:56,247 --> 01:15:57,713
You not liking what he did

1687
01:15:57,715 --> 01:16:00,249
does not speak
to testamentary capacity.

1688
01:16:00,251 --> 01:16:02,652
What about
undue influence?

1689
01:16:02,654 --> 01:16:05,388
Yeah! Undue influence,
how about that? Huh?

1690
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,622
Did you just google that?

1691
01:16:06,624 --> 01:16:08,924
Look, if Marta was
manipulating Dad somehow

1692
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:10,660
- and if we found out...
- If somehow, she had gotten...

1693
01:16:10,662 --> 01:16:11,861
- ...that somehow she was...
- ...her hooks into him...

1694
01:16:11,863 --> 01:16:14,730
You need a strong
case for that.

1695
01:16:14,732 --> 01:16:17,533
"Your Honor,
she endeared herself to him

1696
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,769
"through hard work
and good humor."

1697
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:21,637
That won't cut the salami.

1698
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:23,341
What about
the slayer rule?

1699
01:16:23,975 --> 01:16:26,242
I did just google that.

1700
01:16:26,244 --> 01:16:28,611
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1701
01:16:28,613 --> 01:16:30,546
Well, what the hell
is the slayer rule?

1702
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:31,881
Well, it's if
someone is convicted

1703
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:33,282
of killing the person,

1704
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:34,684
they don't get
their inheritance.

1705
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:35,751
Not even convicted.

1706
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:36,919
Even if they're
held responsible

1707
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:38,322
for their death
in civil court.

1708
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:39,891
Like O.J.?

1709
01:16:40,792 --> 01:16:43,025
Yes, like O.J.

1710
01:16:43,027 --> 01:16:46,230
But Harlan committed suicide.

1711
01:16:54,972 --> 01:16:56,806
Detective Blanc?

1712
01:16:56,808 --> 01:16:58,808
You said
the investigation is ongoing.

1713
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:00,342
You made a point of that.

1714
01:17:00,344 --> 01:17:01,644
Do you suspect foul play?

1715
01:17:01,646 --> 01:17:04,649
Mr. Blanc,
if you please...

1716
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:08,651
There is much
that remains unclear,

1717
01:17:08,653 --> 01:17:10,419
but yes,

1718
01:17:10,421 --> 01:17:13,522
I suspect foul play.

1719
01:17:13,524 --> 01:17:15,825
Marta?

1720
01:17:15,827 --> 01:17:18,730
I have eliminated
no suspects.

1721
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:21,864
You're full of shit.

1722
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:23,933
I don't trust this guy
in the tweed suit.

1723
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:26,270
And, Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

1724
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:27,937
Thank you.

1725
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:29,638
There's only one
answer to this.

1726
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,073
She has to renounce
the inheritance.

1727
01:17:31,075 --> 01:17:32,708
She knows it's
what she should do.

1728
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:33,776
- That's exactly what she...
- It's the right thing to do.

1729
01:17:33,778 --> 01:17:35,010
- Right?
- No way...

1730
01:17:35,012 --> 01:17:36,645
It's the moral thing.

1731
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:38,347
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

1732
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:39,915
If Granddad wanted to give
Marta everything,

1733
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:41,050
then that's what he wanted.

1734
01:17:41,052 --> 01:17:42,451
No.

1735
01:17:42,453 --> 01:17:44,687
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1736
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:46,055
He wanted us taken care of.

1737
01:17:46,057 --> 01:17:48,292
He wanted you
to have an education.

1738
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:50,093
Meg,

1739
01:17:50,095 --> 01:17:52,595
you think I can pay
for your school?

1740
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,107
I know.

1741
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:05,541
Just saying it,
it sounds insane,

1742
01:18:05,543 --> 01:18:06,776
but it's all true.

1743
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:09,578
And I think Blanc's been
on to me from the start.

1744
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,783
I don't care if I go to
jail, but my mom,

1745
01:18:12,517 --> 01:18:13,651
my sister?

1746
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:14,986
We...

1747
01:18:17,555 --> 01:18:18,823
You gonna say something?

1748
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:22,092
I always thought
I was the only one

1749
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:23,494
that could beat him at Go.

1750
01:18:24,629 --> 01:18:26,962
Always thought
that meant something.

1751
01:18:26,964 --> 01:18:28,964
Um, yeah, I know you did.

1752
01:18:28,966 --> 01:18:30,666
That night at the party,

1753
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:32,701
my last
conversation with him...

1754
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,769
My last argument,

1755
01:18:33,771 --> 01:18:36,539
that's what he
told me about you.

1756
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,510
That you beat him at Go more
than I do, and I thought...

1757
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:43,514
What a strange
thing to tell me.

1758
01:18:45,716 --> 01:18:46,951
Think I get it now.

1759
01:18:49,554 --> 01:18:51,322
Maybe it did mean something.

1760
01:18:56,861 --> 01:18:58,828
I'm not gonna tell
my family shit.

1761
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,163
You're not gonna go to jail.

1762
01:19:00,165 --> 01:19:02,998
That detective is not
gonna catch you.

1763
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,502
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

1764
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,969
This is what Granddad
wanted for you.

1765
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:08,804
I mean, think about what he
did to go through with this.

1766
01:19:08,806 --> 01:19:12,142
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1767
01:19:12,144 --> 01:19:13,943
And he wanted it for you.

1768
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:15,413
You've come this far.

1769
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:18,480
Let me help you
go all the way.

1770
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:20,082
What's going on?
This isn't you.

1771
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:21,951
You could just
turn me in right now

1772
01:19:21,953 --> 01:19:23,886
and still get your cut
of the inheritance.

1773
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:25,588
Why?

1774
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,058
Because fuck my family.

1775
01:19:28,826 --> 01:19:30,759
I can help you
get away with this.

1776
01:19:30,761 --> 01:19:32,728
And then,

1777
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:34,799
you're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

1778
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:39,668
Happy ending. Everybody wins.
You, me...

1779
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:40,769
Harlan.

1780
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:41,772
Yeah.

1781
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:44,408
Deal?

1782
01:19:56,554 --> 01:19:57,653
Meg.

1783
01:19:57,655 --> 01:19:58,656
<i>Marta...</i>

1784
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,023
<i>That was nuts.</i>

1785
01:20:01,025 --> 01:20:02,158
I know.

1786
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,527
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1787
01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:07,097
Yeah. Are you?

1788
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,666
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I...</i>

1789
01:20:10,102 --> 01:20:12,534
<i>Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...</i>

1790
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:13,638
<i>I wanted to...</i>

1791
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:19,111
<i>I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.</i>

1792
01:20:20,245 --> 01:20:22,544
<i>And, uh...</i>

1793
01:20:22,546 --> 01:20:25,783
I guess, I wanted to ask,
what are you gonna do?

1794
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:30,153
What do you mean?

1795
01:20:30,155 --> 01:20:31,121
<i>Well, the...</i>

1796
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:33,658
<i>You know, with the will,
what are you gonna do?</i>

1797
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:39,129
What do you
think I should do?

1798
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:43,701
<i>You should do
whatever you think is right.</i>

1799
01:20:44,035 --> 01:20:45,203
Mmm-hmm.

1800
01:20:46,637 --> 01:20:47,638
Look, I...

1801
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:51,609
I think you should
give it back to us.

1802
01:20:53,878 --> 01:20:56,078
<i>Granddad always
took care of us.</i>

1803
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,813
<i>You know, we're his family.</i>

1804
01:20:57,815 --> 01:20:59,682
<i>And I know
he was like family to you,</i>

1805
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:01,219
<i>but we're his actual family.</i>

1806
01:21:01,652 --> 01:21:02,751
Yeah.

1807
01:21:02,753 --> 01:21:04,653
And... Look, Marta,

1808
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:07,157
you know this isn't fair.

1809
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:08,757
We've always been good to you

1810
01:21:08,759 --> 01:21:11,827
<i>and you're like family,
and we'll take care of you,</i>

1811
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,798
<i>but you have
to make things right.</i>

1812
01:21:14,598 --> 01:21:15,666
<i>You know what's right.</i>

1813
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:17,835
<i>Marta...</i>

1814
01:21:20,738 --> 01:21:22,272
Mom's broke.

1815
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:24,840
<i>And she says I'm gonna
have to drop out of school.</i>

1816
01:21:24,842 --> 01:21:26,510
No. No, no, Meg.

1817
01:21:27,912 --> 01:21:29,912
Listen, I won't
let that happen.

1818
01:21:29,914 --> 01:21:32,248
<i>Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you.</i>

1819
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,482
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

1820
01:21:33,484 --> 01:21:35,251
<i>And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you,</i>

1821
01:21:35,253 --> 01:21:36,254
<i>I promise that.</i>

1822
01:21:36,754 --> 01:21:37,820
<i>Okay?</i>

1823
01:21:37,822 --> 01:21:39,255
Thanks.

1824
01:21:39,257 --> 01:21:41,093
<i>And once I...</i>

1825
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:02,011
Okay then.

1826
01:22:02,013 --> 01:22:04,849
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

1827
01:22:06,951 --> 01:22:09,319
Yes, he found mud upstairs.

1828
01:22:09,321 --> 01:22:11,187
Where I broke in
through the window.

1829
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:12,255
Shit.

1830
01:22:12,257 --> 01:22:13,524
Identifiable prints?

1831
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:15,091
No.

1832
01:22:15,093 --> 01:22:16,594
Good. Okay.

1833
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:19,162
Good. Hey...

1834
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:20,796
You lay low
for a couple days,

1835
01:22:20,798 --> 01:22:22,332
wait for this investigation
to blow over,

1836
01:22:22,334 --> 01:22:23,433
and it will.

1837
01:22:23,435 --> 01:22:25,801
'Cause no matter how good
this Blanc guy thinks he is,

1838
01:22:25,803 --> 01:22:26,971
he's got nothin'.

1839
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:30,273
Hey, relax.

1840
01:22:31,909 --> 01:22:33,075
Marta, get your ass up!

1841
01:22:33,077 --> 01:22:33,976
What the hell
is happening?

1842
01:22:33,978 --> 01:22:35,711
There's a guy here,
and a bunch of stuff.

1843
01:22:35,713 --> 01:22:37,215
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

1844
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:40,949
Maybe, Alice.
I don't know.

1845
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:42,051
I don't even know
what that means,

1846
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:43,119
but you better get
your ass up, okay?

1847
01:22:45,022 --> 01:22:46,955
<i>We don't know much
about Marta Cabrera,</i>

1848
01:22:46,957 --> 01:22:48,724
- <i>or her exact relationship...</i>
- Oh, my God...

1849
01:22:48,726 --> 01:22:50,160
- <i>...with Harlan Thrombey...</i>
- Marta, what is all this?

1850
01:22:50,162 --> 01:22:52,694
- <i>...beyond being his home nurse.</i>
- What did you do?

1851
01:22:52,696 --> 01:22:53,796
Is that here?

1852
01:22:53,798 --> 01:22:55,064
Oh, yeah, it is.

1853
01:22:55,066 --> 01:22:57,766
Wait, so is that true?

1854
01:22:57,768 --> 01:22:58,769
Are we rich?

1855
01:23:00,638 --> 01:23:01,737
<i>This is
a story so compelling...</i>

1856
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:02,805
Oh, my God.

1857
01:23:02,807 --> 01:23:04,775
<i>...you would think he had
written the story himself.</i>

1858
01:23:17,422 --> 01:23:19,357
Good morning,
Mrs. Thrombey.

1859
01:23:24,895 --> 01:23:27,665
Why is grief
the providence of youth?

1860
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:30,268
I don't know.

1861
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:37,109
But I'd imagine that age
deepens all feelings.

1862
01:23:38,776 --> 01:23:40,145
Including grief.

1863
01:23:43,013 --> 01:23:47,651
This was a long walk
to offering condolences

1864
01:23:48,386 --> 01:23:50,020
for the loss of your son.

1865
01:23:51,356 --> 01:23:53,989
And asking you,
if it isn't presumptuous of me,

1866
01:23:53,991 --> 01:23:58,261
not to think too harshly
of your family,

1867
01:23:58,263 --> 01:24:02,967
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1868
01:24:04,436 --> 01:24:07,037
They're young, aren't they?

1869
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:15,413
One thing I assume of age

1870
01:24:16,046 --> 01:24:18,214
is weariness.

1871
01:24:18,216 --> 01:24:21,484
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1872
01:24:21,486 --> 01:24:23,919
Tired of what I do.

1873
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:26,955
Following arcs
like lobbed rocks,

1874
01:24:26,957 --> 01:24:29,127
the inevitability of truth.

1875
01:24:32,164 --> 01:24:34,199
But the complexity and the gray

1876
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,067
lie not in the truth

1877
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:41,805
but what you do with the truth
once you have it.

1878
01:24:49,247 --> 01:24:52,217
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1879
01:24:54,018 --> 01:24:56,919
I think you're
very perceptive

1880
01:24:56,921 --> 01:25:00,156
and very capable of
telling me what you saw

1881
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:02,194
the night
of your son's party.

1882
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:12,237
But I'll happily wait.

1883
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,406
I'm in no rush.

1884
01:25:15,906 --> 01:25:17,039
In fact,

1885
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:19,142
I find it quiet pleasant

1886
01:25:19,144 --> 01:25:20,811
sitting here with you.

1887
01:25:29,053 --> 01:25:30,220
Lawyers were here.

1888
01:25:30,222 --> 01:25:31,820
Very big lawyers,
it looked like.

1889
01:25:31,822 --> 01:25:33,956
They left all this stuff
and business cards.

1890
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,325
And there was
a pile of other stuff

1891
01:25:35,327 --> 01:25:37,227
when I got home.

1892
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:39,027
I don't like
any of this, Marta.

1893
01:25:39,897 --> 01:25:41,431
I don't like it either.

1894
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:43,433
I'm slipping out the back.

1895
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:46,003
I'll be back later.
Please don't talk to anyone.

1896
01:25:52,577 --> 01:25:53,777
Walt?

1897
01:25:54,546 --> 01:25:57,146
Yeah, I came, uh...

1898
01:25:57,148 --> 01:25:58,448
Hey, how you doin'?

1899
01:26:01,186 --> 01:26:02,385
Walt, I want you to know

1900
01:26:02,387 --> 01:26:03,952
that I didn't know
about any of this.

1901
01:26:03,954 --> 01:26:05,288
- We know you didn't.
- This is...

1902
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,090
We know you didn't.

1903
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:10,093
Yeah, we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday.

1904
01:26:10,095 --> 01:26:11,795
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

1905
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:15,231
I haven't even
looked at all this, yet.

1906
01:26:15,233 --> 01:26:18,000
It must just be
local lawyers and accountants

1907
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:20,403
who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it.

1908
01:26:20,405 --> 01:26:22,773
Yeah. I'd be careful
of all of it.

1909
01:26:24,942 --> 01:26:29,114
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1910
01:26:32,384 --> 01:26:34,818
This is what Harlan wanted.

1911
01:26:36,588 --> 01:26:38,488
Yeah, but...

1912
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:41,226
Harlan put you in a very hard
position here. I mean,

1913
01:26:41,992 --> 01:26:43,128
it was unfair of him.

1914
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:45,861
I mean, you see

1915
01:26:45,863 --> 01:26:48,997
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up

1916
01:26:48,999 --> 01:26:51,569
and we know,
with your mother...

1917
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,170
My mother?

1918
01:26:54,172 --> 01:26:55,173
Yeah.

1919
01:27:00,545 --> 01:27:03,146
What did Meg tell you?

1920
01:27:03,148 --> 01:27:04,815
Oh, this isn't about...

1921
01:27:06,551 --> 01:27:07,983
You're missing the point.

1922
01:27:07,985 --> 01:27:10,052
We don't wanna
attack you with this,

1923
01:27:10,054 --> 01:27:11,387
but, Marta, if your mother

1924
01:27:11,389 --> 01:27:14,022
came into the
country illegally,

1925
01:27:14,024 --> 01:27:15,224
criminally.

1926
01:27:15,226 --> 01:27:17,160
And you've come
into this inheritance,

1927
01:27:17,162 --> 01:27:18,994
with all the scrutiny
that entails,

1928
01:27:18,996 --> 01:27:21,397
I'd be afraid
that could come to light.

1929
01:27:21,399 --> 01:27:23,466
And that's what
we wanna avoid here.

1930
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:24,569
We can protect you

1931
01:27:25,503 --> 01:27:26,902
from that happening,

1932
01:27:26,904 --> 01:27:28,904
or if it happens.

1933
01:27:28,906 --> 01:27:33,343
So you're saying that
even if it came to light,

1934
01:27:33,345 --> 01:27:36,112
with your family's resources,
you could help me fix it?

1935
01:27:36,114 --> 01:27:37,413
Yeah.

1936
01:27:37,415 --> 01:27:39,549
Yeah, with the right
lawyers, you know?

1937
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:41,016
Not these local guys,

1938
01:27:41,018 --> 01:27:43,586
but New York lawyers,
DC lawyers,

1939
01:27:43,588 --> 01:27:46,054
with enough resources
put toward it, yes.

1940
01:27:46,056 --> 01:27:49,059
Not that that ever even
needs to come up,

1941
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:50,961
but, yes.

1942
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:53,598
Okay, good.

1943
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,501
Okay?

1944
01:27:57,469 --> 01:28:01,537
Because Harlan gave me
all your resources.

1945
01:28:01,539 --> 01:28:03,206
So that means
with my resources,

1946
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:04,940
I'll be able to fix it.

1947
01:28:04,942 --> 01:28:07,008
So I guess
I will find the right lawyers.

1948
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,246
Uh, Marta, that's...

1949
01:28:10,715 --> 01:28:12,517
You better be sure that's

1950
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:15,153
what you want.

1951
01:28:53,258 --> 01:28:55,124
I don't know...
What's this?

1952
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:56,626
It's my
medical bag tag.

1953
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:59,395
They have my medical bag
for some reason.

1954
01:28:59,397 --> 01:29:01,664
Okay, but this is a photocopy
of just the header

1955
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:04,600
of a blood toxicology report
on Harlan.

1956
01:29:04,602 --> 01:29:07,336
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

1957
01:29:10,308 --> 01:29:11,309
So I'm screwed?

1958
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:15,178
How do you know all this stuff?

1959
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:17,348
I was Harlan's research
assistant for a summer.

1960
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,516
But what kind of
blackmail scheme is this?

1961
01:29:20,518 --> 01:29:22,017
I mean, the actual evidence

1962
01:29:22,019 --> 01:29:24,085
is sitting up the street,
at the crime lab.

1963
01:29:24,087 --> 01:29:26,291
There's no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1964
01:29:28,526 --> 01:29:30,328
What's the point
in sending you this?

1965
01:29:40,638 --> 01:29:41,771
It could be
a half hour.

1966
01:29:41,773 --> 01:29:43,372
It could be an hour.
It depends.

1967
01:29:43,374 --> 01:29:44,542
We wanna make sure...

1968
01:29:51,783 --> 01:29:53,349
So, it could take a while.

1969
01:29:53,351 --> 01:29:54,650
- What's the cheese?
- But I'll let you know.

1970
01:29:54,652 --> 01:29:56,219
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

1971
01:29:56,221 --> 01:29:57,653
- Thank you, Chief.
- No problem.

1972
01:29:57,655 --> 01:29:58,588
5:00 a.m.

1973
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,823
Security systems
here are all triggered.

1974
01:30:00,825 --> 01:30:02,725
Now, this thing
went up really quick,

1975
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:04,627
so that means
blood stores, records,

1976
01:30:04,629 --> 01:30:06,829
anything of that nature,
it's all gone.

1977
01:30:06,831 --> 01:30:08,498
There were no
employees here,

1978
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,700
- so, thank God for that.
- Mmm-hmm.

1979
01:30:10,702 --> 01:30:12,570
What about security cameras?

1980
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:14,172
Oh, yeah.

1981
01:30:16,574 --> 01:30:18,307
Speaking of security,

1982
01:30:18,309 --> 01:30:19,775
the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1983
01:30:19,777 --> 01:30:22,079
was all scrambled
for some reason.

1984
01:30:22,347 --> 01:30:24,280
Yeah.

1985
01:30:24,282 --> 01:30:27,082
What's still pending
from the autopsy?

1986
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:28,553
Just a report
on the blood work.

1987
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:31,389
Blood work?

1988
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:37,762
Holy shit.

1989
01:30:41,266 --> 01:30:42,634
This is insane.

1990
01:30:44,269 --> 01:30:46,769
I mean, who would blow up
a whole real building

1991
01:30:46,771 --> 01:30:48,170
just to blackmail me?

1992
01:30:48,172 --> 01:30:49,372
Marta, this means
the blackmailer

1993
01:30:49,374 --> 01:30:50,606
has the only paper copy

1994
01:30:50,608 --> 01:30:52,375
of the thing that
can prove your guilt.

1995
01:30:52,377 --> 01:30:53,809
You didn't get
any other instructions?

1996
01:30:53,811 --> 01:30:55,545
No phone call?
No email? Nothing?

1997
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:57,513
No.

1998
01:30:57,515 --> 01:30:59,484
Well, I haven't
checked my email.

1999
01:31:04,722 --> 01:31:06,422
There is one.

2000
01:31:06,424 --> 01:31:09,794
Yeah, that's it.
"1209, Columbus Road. 10 a.m."

2001
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,300
You know
what this means, right?

2002
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:18,834
If you destroy that copy,

2003
01:31:18,836 --> 01:31:20,405
you're totally in the clear.

2004
01:31:21,172 --> 01:31:22,340
Oh, no.

2005
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:25,376
Marta, did you hear me?

2006
01:31:27,745 --> 01:31:28,746
Yeah.

2007
01:31:36,854 --> 01:31:38,254
Elliott!

2008
01:31:38,256 --> 01:31:39,424
We gotta go!
We gotta go!

2009
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,560
- Okay, baby driver.
- Oh, God.

2010
01:31:44,562 --> 01:31:45,895
You regret helping me yet?

2011
01:31:45,897 --> 01:31:47,563
I regret not
taking the Beemer.

2012
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:51,334
Oh, shit.

2013
01:32:04,849 --> 01:32:05,915
Vehicles in pursuit

2014
01:32:05,917 --> 01:32:06,882
- on Washington Street.
- No force.

2015
01:32:06,884 --> 01:32:08,484
- Make sure you say "no force."
- No force.

2016
01:32:08,486 --> 01:32:09,552
We got a possible
murder suspect.

2017
01:32:09,554 --> 01:32:10,722
I said that. I said that.

2018
01:32:12,724 --> 01:32:14,757
Go. Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

2019
01:32:14,759 --> 01:32:16,461
I am literally flooring it!

2020
01:32:27,538 --> 01:32:29,372
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over. I'm...

2021
01:32:29,374 --> 01:32:30,439
If you miss your chance

2022
01:32:30,441 --> 01:32:31,843
to get this tox report,
it's all over.

2023
01:32:32,543 --> 01:32:33,745
Oh, my God.

2024
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:38,614
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

2025
01:32:38,616 --> 01:32:39,982
Why... Why are we stopping?

2026
01:32:39,984 --> 01:32:42,353
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

2027
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:56,401
Hold on.

2028
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:22,892
Oh, my God, I'm just
pure adrenaline right now.

2029
01:33:22,894 --> 01:33:24,794
I feel like I swallowed bees.

2030
01:33:24,796 --> 01:33:25,661
Okay...

2031
01:33:25,663 --> 01:33:27,463
So where is it?
What's the address?

2032
01:33:27,465 --> 01:33:28,898
1209, Columbus Road.

2033
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,800
Okay. I mean,
whatever they want,

2034
01:33:30,802 --> 01:33:32,268
- I'll say yes...
- Anything.

2035
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:33,636
You know, just to get
that report back.

2036
01:33:33,638 --> 01:33:35,805
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

2037
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:37,375
Holy shit, Ransom.

2038
01:33:38,042 --> 01:33:39,644
Hey, thank you.

2039
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:42,246
I couldn't do this without you.

2040
01:33:45,383 --> 01:33:47,351
Oh, my God.

2041
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:49,821
Get out.

2042
01:33:51,622 --> 01:33:54,724
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

2043
01:33:54,726 --> 01:33:56,058
Put your hands down.

2044
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,728
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana.

2045
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:00,563
Night of the party,
she saw someone

2046
01:34:00,565 --> 01:34:03,299
climbing the trellis
to the third floor.

2047
01:34:03,301 --> 01:34:05,735
- Mr. Drysdale, come on.
- Let's go.

2048
01:34:05,737 --> 01:34:07,670
Pat him down,
check him out.

2049
01:34:07,672 --> 01:34:09,472
What's going on?

2050
01:34:09,474 --> 01:34:11,373
"Ransom came back,"
she said.

2051
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:12,608
Hands on the vehicle.

2052
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,843
I don't know
what he came back to do,

2053
01:34:13,845 --> 01:34:15,010
but we'll find out.

2054
01:34:15,012 --> 01:34:17,346
You got anything sharp?

2055
01:34:17,348 --> 01:34:19,315
Watch your head. Thank you.

2056
01:34:19,317 --> 01:34:20,282
Hey, you don't need
to thank him.

2057
01:34:20,284 --> 01:34:23,488
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

2058
01:34:25,022 --> 01:34:26,324
Yes.

2059
01:34:33,765 --> 01:34:35,397
Blanc, coming with us?

2060
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:37,666
I'll drive with Marta.

2061
01:34:37,668 --> 01:34:39,368
Let's go to the
police station.

2062
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:42,772
I want a full rundown
on everything he said to you.

2063
01:34:42,774 --> 01:34:44,509
I'll catch you up
on where we're at.

2064
01:34:51,549 --> 01:34:54,318
<i>Strange case from the start.</i>

2065
01:34:55,486 --> 01:34:58,523
A case with a hole
in the middle.

2066
01:35:00,525 --> 01:35:01,726
A donut.

2067
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,394
I'm just talking
through my process here,

2068
01:35:05,396 --> 01:35:07,730
let me know
if this is boring.

2069
01:35:07,732 --> 01:35:09,865
I feel the noose tightening.

2070
01:35:09,867 --> 01:35:12,470
The family is
truly desperate.

2071
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:14,605
Desperate motives,

2072
01:35:15,473 --> 01:35:17,606
the mystery of who hired me,

2073
01:35:17,608 --> 01:35:19,410
the impossibility of the crime,

2074
01:35:20,478 --> 01:35:21,846
and yet...

2075
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,680
A donut.

2076
01:35:24,682 --> 01:35:27,383
One central piece

2077
01:35:27,385 --> 01:35:30,486
and if it reveals itself,
the fog would lift,

2078
01:35:30,488 --> 01:35:34,690
the arc would resolve,
the Slinky become unkinked.

2079
01:35:34,692 --> 01:35:36,692
Do you mind
if I stop for a second?

2080
01:35:36,694 --> 01:35:38,161
I need to pick something up.

2081
01:35:38,163 --> 01:35:39,597
It'll be very quick.

2082
01:35:40,898 --> 01:35:42,066
Sure.

2083
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,012
It'll be just a few minutes.

2084
01:35:57,014 --> 01:35:58,416
Watch the, uh,

2085
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,051
door.

2086
01:36:22,607 --> 01:36:23,641
Hello?

2087
01:36:47,498 --> 01:36:49,500
Listen, I don't know
what you want...

2088
01:36:52,069 --> 01:36:54,069
Whatever it is,
we can work it out.

2089
01:36:54,071 --> 01:36:56,805
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

2090
01:36:56,807 --> 01:36:58,676
And I'm leaving
with that report.

2091
01:37:03,115 --> 01:37:04,448
Hello?

2092
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,641
Fran?

2093
01:37:40,651 --> 01:37:43,085
No, no, no, no! Fran?

2094
01:37:43,087 --> 01:37:45,288
Oh, my God, Fran.

2095
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:47,056
Can you hear me?

2096
01:37:47,058 --> 01:37:49,259
Fran, give me a sign
if you can hear me.

2097
01:37:49,261 --> 01:37:51,694
- You...
- Yes, it's me. It's Marta.

2098
01:37:51,696 --> 01:37:53,696
You called me here,
you sent me an email,

2099
01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:55,831
that's why I'm here.
Did you take something?

2100
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:58,134
I'm gonna call an ambulance
now, you're gonna be okay.

2101
01:37:58,136 --> 01:37:59,302
You're gonna be fine, okay?

2102
01:37:59,304 --> 01:38:00,736
- Stay with me.
- Copy...

2103
01:38:00,738 --> 01:38:02,140
- What?
- Copy...

2104
01:38:03,241 --> 01:38:04,573
Stashed...

2105
01:38:04,575 --> 01:38:05,843
What? What are you saying?

2106
01:38:07,078 --> 01:38:09,279
You did this.

2107
01:38:09,281 --> 01:38:11,613
Won't get away with this.

2108
01:38:11,615 --> 01:38:12,783
Jesus, stop it!

2109
01:38:35,006 --> 01:38:37,008
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

2110
01:38:38,243 --> 01:38:43,078
<i>♪ The thought of you
stays bright</i>

2111
01:38:44,316 --> 01:38:49,221
<i>♪ Sometimes I stand
in the middle of the floor</i>

2112
01:38:50,855 --> 01:38:54,725
<i>♪ Not going left</i>

2113
01:38:55,926 --> 01:38:57,026
<i>♪ Not going...</i>

2114
01:38:57,028 --> 01:38:58,861
Oh, Lord.

2115
01:39:00,365 --> 01:39:03,034
All right, my friend,
thank you for the update.

2116
01:39:04,136 --> 01:39:05,235
No need for that.

2117
01:39:05,237 --> 01:39:07,069
I'll bring her in
once we get word

2118
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:08,804
that the housekeeper
is stable.

2119
01:39:08,806 --> 01:39:10,041
It's still
touch and go.

2120
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:11,709
All right.

2121
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:14,244
Listen, this is over.

2122
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:15,880
People are getting hurt.

2123
01:39:18,682 --> 01:39:19,815
So I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

2124
01:39:19,817 --> 01:39:23,621
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

2125
01:39:24,055 --> 01:39:24,920
Good.

2126
01:39:24,922 --> 01:39:27,190
Wait, I hope he
didn't cover for me.

2127
01:39:27,192 --> 01:39:28,857
Did he tell you
the real truth

2128
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:30,893
- about me switching the...
- Yeah.

2129
01:39:30,895 --> 01:39:32,262
- And the disguise bit?
- Yes.

2130
01:39:32,264 --> 01:39:33,896
And the whole blackmail and...

2131
01:39:33,898 --> 01:39:35,198
Mmm-hmm.

2132
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,666
But why did Fran
take my morphine?

2133
01:39:37,668 --> 01:39:39,968
I mean, obviously she had
swiped the bag from the house,

2134
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:42,004
but she didn't seem like
a user to me,

2135
01:39:42,006 --> 01:39:44,307
unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.

2136
01:39:44,309 --> 01:39:46,242
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

2137
01:39:46,244 --> 01:39:48,144
I have to tell the
Thrombeys myself,

2138
01:39:48,146 --> 01:39:49,212
I feel like I owe that to them.

2139
01:39:49,214 --> 01:39:50,946
I don't think
that's a good idea.

2140
01:39:50,948 --> 01:39:53,050
No, I have to do it.
I need to do it.

2141
01:39:55,019 --> 01:39:56,419
I gave the doctors
my number,

2142
01:39:56,421 --> 01:39:58,221
so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.

2143
01:39:58,223 --> 01:39:59,189
All right.

2144
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:01,124
I'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house,

2145
01:40:01,126 --> 01:40:03,226
along with a police escort.

2146
01:40:03,228 --> 01:40:05,428
For the arrest after.

2147
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:07,965
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

2148
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:11,136
I don't want
any more surprises.

2149
01:40:26,951 --> 01:40:28,451
Fran said
it was stashed,

2150
01:40:28,453 --> 01:40:29,920
the copy, and then she said,

2151
01:40:31,088 --> 01:40:33,323
"You did this.
You won't get away with it,"

2152
01:40:33,325 --> 01:40:36,026
and I called the ambulance.

2153
01:40:36,794 --> 01:40:37,895
That's it.

2154
01:40:39,097 --> 01:40:40,098
All right.

2155
01:40:42,267 --> 01:40:44,702
You ready?

2156
01:40:49,341 --> 01:40:50,739
Oh!

2157
01:40:50,741 --> 01:40:52,175
Okay.

2158
01:40:52,177 --> 01:40:54,210
Well, has she
come to her senses?

2159
01:40:54,212 --> 01:40:55,844
Well, she's standing
right there, Richard,

2160
01:40:55,846 --> 01:40:56,912
she can speak for herself.

2161
01:40:56,914 --> 01:40:57,980
Is the rest
of the family here?

2162
01:40:57,982 --> 01:40:59,047
In the living room.

2163
01:40:59,049 --> 01:41:00,082
I think that it
would be better

2164
01:41:00,084 --> 01:41:02,387
if we were to gather again
and get this over with.

2165
01:41:08,058 --> 01:41:09,427
- Hey.
- Hey.

2166
01:41:11,829 --> 01:41:13,795
I'm so sorry I told
them about your mom.

2167
01:41:13,797 --> 01:41:16,232
Meg, it's okay.

2168
01:41:16,234 --> 01:41:17,866
I'm sorry. No...
I was scared. I just...

2169
01:41:17,868 --> 01:41:18,967
I didn't wanna tell them.

2170
01:41:18,969 --> 01:41:20,037
I get it.

2171
01:41:20,472 --> 01:41:21,705
Trust me,

2172
01:41:22,474 --> 01:41:24,742
I understand.
It's all right.

2173
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:26,844
I'm sorry.

2174
01:41:30,047 --> 01:41:32,881
God, I am so raiding
Fran's stash after this.

2175
01:41:32,883 --> 01:41:36,018
I still think
this is a bad idea,

2176
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:38,156
but the family is assembled.

2177
01:41:41,426 --> 01:41:43,295
I know where
the tox report is.

2178
01:41:50,968 --> 01:41:52,703
She basically told me
where it was.

2179
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:57,041
Anyways, this will
tie everything up.

2180
01:41:59,277 --> 01:42:00,911
And I just
handed it to you.

2181
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,915
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

2182
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,084
Well, to be fair,

2183
01:42:08,953 --> 01:42:11,289
you make
a pretty lousy murderer.

2184
01:42:13,291 --> 01:42:15,059
Perhaps we
deserve each other.

2185
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:28,939
You've always
been good to me.

2186
01:42:30,908 --> 01:42:33,075
And what I'm about to say
isn't gonna be easy

2187
01:42:33,077 --> 01:42:35,144
and you're gonna
be upset.

2188
01:42:35,146 --> 01:42:37,280
But I thought after
what you've gone through

2189
01:42:37,282 --> 01:42:38,350
the last few days,

2190
01:42:39,517 --> 01:42:42,050
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

2191
01:42:42,052 --> 01:42:43,188
Hmm.

2192
01:42:45,022 --> 01:42:46,291
- I...
- Excuse me!

2193
01:42:50,595 --> 01:42:53,862
You have not been good to her.

2194
01:42:53,864 --> 01:42:56,031
You have all
treated her like shit,

2195
01:42:56,033 --> 01:42:58,468
to steal back a fortune
that you lost,

2196
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:00,203
and she deserves.

2197
01:43:00,205 --> 01:43:03,206
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast!

2198
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:05,174
Knives out, beaks bloody!

2199
01:43:05,176 --> 01:43:07,143
Well...

2200
01:43:07,145 --> 01:43:10,513
You're not getting bailed
out, not this time.

2201
01:43:10,515 --> 01:43:13,416
Ms. Cabrera has
decided, definitively,

2202
01:43:13,418 --> 01:43:15,318
not to renounce
the inheritance.

2203
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,153
- What?
- What?

2204
01:43:17,155 --> 01:43:20,156
Furthermore, it will be
my professional recommendation

2205
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:22,592
to the local authorities
that the manner of death

2206
01:43:22,594 --> 01:43:26,596
in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide!

2207
01:43:26,598 --> 01:43:28,264
- And the case is closed.
- Blanc?

2208
01:43:28,266 --> 01:43:29,332
What?

2209
01:43:29,334 --> 01:43:31,134
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

2210
01:43:31,136 --> 01:43:32,537
What's going on?
Just tell me...

2211
01:43:34,506 --> 01:43:37,173
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

2212
01:43:37,175 --> 01:43:38,408
No.

2213
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:39,375
Is anybody else confused?

2214
01:43:39,377 --> 01:43:41,845
Not what I was expecting
to hear at all.

2215
01:43:44,382 --> 01:43:45,981
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

2216
01:43:45,983 --> 01:43:47,216
Yes. Yes.

2217
01:43:47,218 --> 01:43:49,084
I just wanna come clean, okay?

2218
01:43:49,086 --> 01:43:50,386
- It's over.
- Almost.

2219
01:43:50,388 --> 01:43:51,887
Blanc, what are we doing?

2220
01:43:51,889 --> 01:43:54,257
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

2221
01:43:54,259 --> 01:43:55,991
Keep the family
out of this room,

2222
01:43:55,993 --> 01:43:57,393
and get 'em out of
the house if you can.

2223
01:43:57,395 --> 01:43:59,529
But stand by
with your additional officer.

2224
01:43:59,531 --> 01:44:00,563
Get the family out?

2225
01:44:00,565 --> 01:44:02,498
Yes, but not all of them.
Would you...

2226
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,599
Thank you.

2227
01:44:03,601 --> 01:44:04,534
- Blanc...
- Yes, sir.

2228
01:44:04,536 --> 01:44:06,402
Come on, come on,
what's all this drama?

2229
01:44:06,404 --> 01:44:08,237
- Indulge me.
- Blanc,

2230
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:10,106
I told Ransom, Ransom told you,

2231
01:44:10,108 --> 01:44:11,641
and I'm telling you now,

2232
01:44:11,643 --> 01:44:14,610
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

2233
01:44:14,612 --> 01:44:17,280
Yes, you did, yes, he did,
yes, you are.

2234
01:44:17,282 --> 01:44:20,483
But... But, I spoke in the car
about the hole

2235
01:44:20,485 --> 01:44:22,618
at the center of this donut.

2236
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:25,355
And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night

2237
01:44:25,357 --> 01:44:28,558
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly.

2238
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:31,960
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

2239
01:44:31,962 --> 01:44:34,564
But we must
look a little closer.

2240
01:44:34,566 --> 01:44:37,600
And when we do,
we see the donut hole

2241
01:44:37,602 --> 01:44:40,001
has a hole in its center.

2242
01:44:40,003 --> 01:44:42,171
It is not a donut hole,

2243
01:44:42,173 --> 01:44:45,141
but a smaller donut
with its own hole

2244
01:44:45,143 --> 01:44:48,111
and our donut
is not whole at all!

2245
01:44:48,113 --> 01:44:50,279
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you...

2246
01:44:50,281 --> 01:44:52,484
Why was I hired?

2247
01:44:53,284 --> 01:44:55,016
Why would someone hire me?

2248
01:44:55,018 --> 01:44:56,419
Someone fishing
for a crime

2249
01:44:56,421 --> 01:44:57,720
to reverse the will, Blanc.
Come on.

2250
01:44:57,722 --> 01:45:00,223
But I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

2251
01:45:00,225 --> 01:45:01,524
So, yes,

2252
01:45:01,526 --> 01:45:04,660
the person must have known
the contents of the will.

2253
01:45:04,662 --> 01:45:05,762
But one step further,

2254
01:45:05,764 --> 01:45:09,165
that same person must have
known a crime was committed,

2255
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:11,100
and further...

2256
01:45:11,102 --> 01:45:16,139
If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

2257
01:45:16,141 --> 01:45:19,208
they must have known
that Marta was responsible.

2258
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:21,577
An intriguing combination
of factors.

2259
01:45:21,579 --> 01:45:23,379
Someone who knew
what Marta did

2260
01:45:23,381 --> 01:45:25,046
wanted to expose it

2261
01:45:25,048 --> 01:45:27,082
but could not reveal
how they knew.

2262
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:28,451
Fran!

2263
01:45:28,453 --> 01:45:31,287
She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.

2264
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:32,622
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,

2265
01:45:32,624 --> 01:45:35,091
ergo she did not want
the crime exposed.

2266
01:45:35,093 --> 01:45:36,626
What if someone
in the family had observed

2267
01:45:36,628 --> 01:45:37,727
Marta doing
something suspicious?

2268
01:45:37,729 --> 01:45:41,132
But they would have had
no reason not to speak up.

2269
01:45:42,767 --> 01:45:46,769
The answer
is not so simple.

2270
01:45:46,771 --> 01:45:51,340
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

2271
01:45:51,342 --> 01:45:54,379
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

2272
01:45:56,448 --> 01:45:59,184
Marta it will not
be easy for you to hear.

2273
01:45:59,717 --> 01:46:02,351
But there is at least

2274
01:46:02,353 --> 01:46:05,388
one truly guilty party
behind it all,

2275
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:08,558
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

2276
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,230
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

2277
01:46:15,065 --> 01:46:16,299
Trooper Wagner.

2278
01:46:16,301 --> 01:46:17,735
Trooper Wagner?

2279
01:46:19,069 --> 01:46:20,070
No.

2280
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,440
Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

2281
01:46:24,442 --> 01:46:26,108
I figured it was up.
I'm sorry.

2282
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:28,478
Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

2283
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,079
Not exactly
everything though.

2284
01:46:31,081 --> 01:46:33,382
Is this about
what Greatnana told you?

2285
01:46:33,384 --> 01:46:36,352
She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.

2286
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:37,420
We'll get to that.

2287
01:46:37,422 --> 01:46:39,455
In the meanwhile,

2288
01:46:39,457 --> 01:46:42,258
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

2289
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:46,063
you might tell us all
why you hired me.

2290
01:46:49,367 --> 01:46:51,434
Why I hired you?

2291
01:46:51,436 --> 01:46:53,636
You're right,
let's back it up...

2292
01:46:53,638 --> 01:46:55,271
To the night of the party.

2293
01:46:55,273 --> 01:46:57,740
<i>Your argument with Harlan.</i>

2294
01:46:57,742 --> 01:46:59,342
What were the overheard words

2295
01:46:59,344 --> 01:47:02,445
by the Nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom?

2296
01:47:02,447 --> 01:47:06,115
<i>"My will," and
"I'm warning you."</i>

2297
01:47:06,117 --> 01:47:08,551
You and Harlan
were drama mamas,

2298
01:47:08,553 --> 01:47:11,587
you shared a love of twisting
the knife into one another.

2299
01:47:11,589 --> 01:47:13,189
You see, I don't believe

2300
01:47:13,191 --> 01:47:14,690
he would have
slipped it in halfway,

2301
01:47:14,692 --> 01:47:15,693
no, no, no.

2302
01:47:16,528 --> 01:47:18,327
I submit

2303
01:47:18,329 --> 01:47:20,830
Harlan told you everything.

2304
01:47:20,832 --> 01:47:22,298
You can't be serious!

2305
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,701
Not a red dime
or word of my work

2306
01:47:25,703 --> 01:47:28,239
to a single one of them,
you included.

2307
01:47:28,573 --> 01:47:30,106
Marta,

2308
01:47:30,108 --> 01:47:31,507
remind me what Ransom said

2309
01:47:31,509 --> 01:47:34,644
his conversation
with Harlan ended with?

2310
01:47:34,646 --> 01:47:37,246
Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

2311
01:47:37,248 --> 01:47:39,148
And I asked myself,

2312
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:40,316
"Marta?

2313
01:47:40,318 --> 01:47:42,351
"Why would the topic of the will

2314
01:47:42,353 --> 01:47:44,756
"have steered around
to Marta?"

2315
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:49,292
There is one
obvious explanation...

2316
01:47:49,294 --> 01:47:50,326
You can't be that crazy.

2317
01:47:50,328 --> 01:47:52,328
You're not just gonna
throw away your fortune.

2318
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:54,363
No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2319
01:47:54,365 --> 01:47:55,665
All of it.

2320
01:47:56,768 --> 01:47:58,200
Your Brazilian nurse?

2321
01:47:58,202 --> 01:47:59,535
Are you goddamn insane?

2322
01:47:59,537 --> 01:48:02,638
I'm sane for the first time
in my life,

2323
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:03,706
- and I've done it.
- Harlan, if you think

2324
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:04,640
I'm gonna let this happen,

2325
01:48:04,642 --> 01:48:05,541
if you think I'm gonna
stand here and...

2326
01:48:05,543 --> 01:48:07,677
I've made the change
to my will. It's done.

2327
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:08,680
I'm warning you!

2328
01:48:09,914 --> 01:48:11,749
That's some
heavy-duty conjecture.

2329
01:48:12,383 --> 01:48:13,816
Granted.

2330
01:48:13,818 --> 01:48:17,687
But it is the only way
what comes next makes sense.

2331
01:48:17,689 --> 01:48:20,558
So you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

2332
01:48:21,893 --> 01:48:23,593
<i>You tell Marta later...</i>

2333
01:48:23,595 --> 01:48:26,264
What was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

2334
01:48:26,631 --> 01:48:28,364
Clarity.

2335
01:48:28,366 --> 01:48:31,235
That he had to make do
for himself from here on out.

2336
01:48:31,569 --> 01:48:32,635
Exactly.

2337
01:48:35,573 --> 01:48:38,541
<i>Marta. The will. Harlan.</i>

2338
01:48:38,543 --> 01:48:40,242
<i>"Do for yourself."</i>

2339
01:48:40,244 --> 01:48:42,180
<i>"You won't get away with this."</i>

2340
01:48:42,714 --> 01:48:44,716
<i>And a plan forms.</i>

2341
01:48:53,391 --> 01:48:54,690
<i>You return,</i>

2342
01:48:54,692 --> 01:48:57,760
<i>careful to avoid the gate's
security camera range.</i>

2343
01:48:57,762 --> 01:49:00,329
<i>Then on foot up
towards the house,</i>

2344
01:49:00,331 --> 01:49:02,264
<i>you sneak in up the trellis,</i>

2345
01:49:02,266 --> 01:49:04,667
<i>so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family</i>

2346
01:49:04,669 --> 01:49:07,505
<i>who are still having
their party downstairs.</i>

2347
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:12,975
<i>What you need to do
will take moments.</i>

2348
01:49:12,977 --> 01:49:17,513
<i>But it is essential that you
are alone and undetected.</i>

2349
01:49:17,515 --> 01:49:20,216
<i>You knew what
medications Harlan took.</i>

2350
01:49:20,218 --> 01:49:22,920
<i>You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.</i>

2351
01:49:23,888 --> 01:49:24,889
<i>And you knew</i>

2352
01:49:25,923 --> 01:49:29,692
if Marta was responsible
for his death,

2353
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:32,561
<i>even unintentionally,</i>

2354
01:49:32,563 --> 01:49:35,598
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will

2355
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,734
and you would
get your share back.

2356
01:49:38,736 --> 01:49:40,536
<i>You used
the syringes in the kit</i>

2357
01:49:40,538 --> 01:49:43,541
<i>to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials.</i>

2358
01:49:44,542 --> 01:49:45,843
And as a final precaution...

2359
01:49:47,845 --> 01:49:49,781
<i>you took the Naloxone,</i>

2360
01:49:50,581 --> 01:49:53,683
the lifesaving antidote.

2361
01:49:53,685 --> 01:49:56,018
<i>No. No, no, no,
that's impossible.</i>

2362
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:57,820
That is the truth.

2363
01:49:57,822 --> 01:50:00,423
Hand me that vial of morphine,
I'll show you.

2364
01:50:00,425 --> 01:50:03,426
If he did that,
if the meds were switched,

2365
01:50:03,428 --> 01:50:05,763
then when I got them
mixed up, I...

2366
01:50:07,398 --> 01:50:09,500
I accidentally
switched them back,

2367
01:50:10,835 --> 01:50:12,034
so I gave Harlan...

2368
01:50:12,036 --> 01:50:13,438
The correct doses.

2369
01:50:14,005 --> 01:50:15,373
Yes.

2370
01:50:17,809 --> 01:50:19,343
But not accidentally.

2371
01:50:20,878 --> 01:50:23,948
I taped over the label
of these two vials.

2372
01:50:25,283 --> 01:50:27,919
The vials themselves
are identical.

2373
01:50:30,655 --> 01:50:33,322
How'd you know
this was the morphine?

2374
01:50:33,324 --> 01:50:34,724
I just knew.

2375
01:50:34,726 --> 01:50:36,692
You knew because
there is the slightest,

2376
01:50:36,694 --> 01:50:37,793
almost imperceptible
differences

2377
01:50:37,795 --> 01:50:40,431
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

2378
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,770
You knew because you've
done it a hundred times.

2379
01:50:47,371 --> 01:50:49,638
You gave him
the correct medication

2380
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:52,009
because you are a good nurse.

2381
01:50:53,444 --> 01:50:54,677
Then Harlan was...

2382
01:50:54,679 --> 01:50:56,681
I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.

2383
01:50:58,049 --> 01:51:00,251
- Harlan was perfectly fine.
- Oh, my God.

2384
01:51:01,352 --> 01:51:03,619
His blood was normal.

2385
01:51:03,621 --> 01:51:07,423
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide,

2386
01:51:07,425 --> 01:51:08,991
and you are guilty

2387
01:51:08,993 --> 01:51:10,993
of nothing but some damage
to the trellis

2388
01:51:10,995 --> 01:51:13,496
and a few amateur theatrics.

2389
01:51:13,498 --> 01:51:15,931
In fact,
if Harlan had listened to you

2390
01:51:15,933 --> 01:51:17,802
and called the ambulance,

2391
01:51:19,637 --> 01:51:20,872
he would be alive today.

2392
01:51:24,909 --> 01:51:25,975
Damn!

2393
01:51:25,977 --> 01:51:27,545
A twisted web

2394
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,046
and we are not finished
untangling it.

2395
01:51:31,048 --> 01:51:32,882
Not yet.

2396
01:51:32,884 --> 01:51:35,050
Marta, when Greatnana
spotted you

2397
01:51:35,052 --> 01:51:36,921
climbing down
the trellis, she said...

2398
01:51:38,456 --> 01:51:42,125
Ransom?
Are you back again already?

2399
01:51:42,127 --> 01:51:45,060
<i>"Are you back
again already?"</i>

2400
01:51:45,062 --> 01:51:46,531
'Cause earlier that night...

2401
01:51:49,667 --> 01:51:52,036
Ransom, you're back?

2402
01:51:53,571 --> 01:51:55,704
Come on, Marta.

2403
01:51:55,706 --> 01:51:58,007
This is stoopid with two o's.

2404
01:51:58,009 --> 01:51:59,475
You don't have
a shred of evidence,

2405
01:51:59,477 --> 01:52:01,076
you're just
spinning a fairy tale.

2406
01:52:01,078 --> 01:52:02,778
Not a shred, no.

2407
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,881
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta mixing up the vials,

2408
01:52:05,883 --> 01:52:07,049
so it's your word...

2409
01:52:07,051 --> 01:52:08,452
You have her confession!

2410
01:52:11,055 --> 01:52:12,557
All right, yeah.

2411
01:52:13,424 --> 01:52:14,824
Yeah, we do have that.

2412
01:52:14,826 --> 01:52:15,891
With your permission,

2413
01:52:15,893 --> 01:52:17,660
I'd like to spin
a little further.

2414
01:52:17,662 --> 01:52:19,095
<i>Much later that night,</i>

2415
01:52:19,097 --> 01:52:21,097
<i>you'd have to come back
to the house...</i>

2416
01:52:21,099 --> 01:52:23,465
<i>to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.</i>

2417
01:52:23,467 --> 01:52:26,635
<i>However, this time
the dogs were outside.</i>

2418
01:52:29,073 --> 01:52:31,407
<i>They barked,
waking Meg.</i>

2419
01:52:31,409 --> 01:52:32,575
<i>No matter.</i>

2420
01:52:32,577 --> 01:52:34,543
<i>You'll get the vials tomorrow.</i>

2421
01:52:34,545 --> 01:52:36,179
But tomorrow brings news...

2422
01:52:36,181 --> 01:52:39,014
Not of a medical error
and a guilty nurse,

2423
01:52:39,016 --> 01:52:41,419
but of a slit throat
and a suicide.

2424
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:48,791
<i>Now the circumstances
are perfect</i>

2425
01:52:48,793 --> 01:52:51,460
<i>for the anonymous hirin' of me.</i>

2426
01:52:51,462 --> 01:52:53,896
<i>You know a crime has been
committed by Miss Cabrera,</i>

2427
01:52:53,898 --> 01:52:55,664
<i>you need her
to be caught for it.</i>

2428
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:58,136
You cannot reveal
how you know.

2429
01:52:59,937 --> 01:53:01,171
Enter...

2430
01:53:01,173 --> 01:53:02,872
Benoit Blanc.

2431
01:53:02,874 --> 01:53:04,440
Benny, look...

2432
01:53:04,442 --> 01:53:05,574
I hear what you're saying,
but this...

2433
01:53:06,544 --> 01:53:08,744
The body is discovered early
the next morning.

2434
01:53:08,746 --> 01:53:09,778
<i>The police,</i>

2435
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,447
<i>the medical examiner,
the family,</i>

2436
01:53:11,449 --> 01:53:13,616
everyone swarms in

2437
01:53:13,618 --> 01:53:15,484
and there is no possible way

2438
01:53:15,486 --> 01:53:17,086
you can get to
Marta's medical bag

2439
01:53:17,088 --> 01:53:18,554
to retrieve the vials.

2440
01:53:18,556 --> 01:53:20,022
You must wait
for your moment,

2441
01:53:20,024 --> 01:53:21,924
when the investigation
is over

2442
01:53:21,926 --> 01:53:25,161
and you know
the house will be empty.

2443
01:53:25,163 --> 01:53:27,496
And that is why

2444
01:53:27,498 --> 01:53:28,900
you missed the funeral.

2445
01:53:30,135 --> 01:53:31,834
<i>There is no one home to wonder</i>

2446
01:53:31,836 --> 01:53:33,971
<i>why you're going
into Harlan's study.</i>

2447
01:53:35,107 --> 01:53:36,972
<i>Or so you think.</i>

2448
01:53:39,977 --> 01:53:41,510
<i>Poor Fran.</i>

2449
01:53:41,512 --> 01:53:42,711
<i>She witnessed you tampering</i>

2450
01:53:42,713 --> 01:53:45,547
<i>with Harlan's medication
in the medical bag.</i>

2451
01:53:45,549 --> 01:53:49,185
<i>She did not know
what you were doing.</i>

2452
01:53:49,187 --> 01:53:51,820
<i>But she knew
you were up to no good.</i>

2453
01:53:51,822 --> 01:53:53,822
<i>So her mind begins to turn.</i>

2454
01:53:53,824 --> 01:53:55,624
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2455
01:53:55,626 --> 01:53:57,559
That Hallmark movie
she told me about,

2456
01:53:57,561 --> 01:53:58,894
with Danica McKellar...

2457
01:53:58,896 --> 01:54:00,096
<i>Deadly by Surprise.</i>

2458
01:54:00,098 --> 01:54:01,697
That's what
she was talking about.

2459
01:54:01,699 --> 01:54:02,900
She loved Harlan.

2460
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:05,268
She hates Ransom.

2461
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:07,736
So the poor girl decides
to test her theory,

2462
01:54:07,738 --> 01:54:09,571
and make this asshole pay.

2463
01:54:09,573 --> 01:54:12,608
She gets a copy
of the toxicology report.

2464
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:16,011
Now, I will be honest,
I have no idea how.

2465
01:54:16,013 --> 01:54:17,613
'Cause she has a cousin.

2466
01:54:17,615 --> 01:54:19,115
She told me,
she has a cousin

2467
01:54:19,117 --> 01:54:21,784
who works as a receptionist
at the examiner's office.

2468
01:54:21,786 --> 01:54:23,052
Well, <i>voila!</i>

2469
01:54:23,054 --> 01:54:26,021
The numbers,
they mean nothing to her,

2470
01:54:26,023 --> 01:54:29,825
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat

2471
01:54:29,827 --> 01:54:32,830
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

2472
01:54:33,831 --> 01:54:35,531
So why did she send it to me?

2473
01:54:35,533 --> 01:54:37,066
She didn't.

2474
01:54:37,068 --> 01:54:38,836
She sent it to Ransom.

2475
01:54:43,975 --> 01:54:46,209
<i>And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,</i>

2476
01:54:46,211 --> 01:54:47,778
<i>what is his reaction?</i>

2477
01:54:48,546 --> 01:54:49,578
Elation.

2478
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:52,182
<i>He still thinks Marta
has given Harlan</i>

2479
01:54:52,184 --> 01:54:53,249
<i>the tampered drugs.</i>

2480
01:54:53,251 --> 01:54:56,219
<i>A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.</i>

2481
01:54:56,221 --> 01:54:58,654
<i>He goes to the will reading
in high spirits,</i>

2482
01:54:58,656 --> 01:55:01,557
ready to see the family
tear itself apart,

2483
01:55:01,559 --> 01:55:03,726
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone

2484
01:55:03,728 --> 01:55:06,530
when the tox report
comes to light.

2485
01:55:07,732 --> 01:55:09,132
And then...

2486
01:55:10,202 --> 01:55:12,668
<i>Marta's confession.</i>

2487
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:15,238
<i>And everything
turns on its head.</i>

2488
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:19,608
<i>He now realizes that Marta
has committed no crime</i>

2489
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:23,679
<i>and the tox report
will prove her innocence.</i>

2490
01:55:23,681 --> 01:55:25,616
<i>The changed will
is gonna stand.</i>

2491
01:55:26,017 --> 01:55:27,850
<i>He has lost.</i>

2492
01:55:29,653 --> 01:55:30,721
<i>Unless...</i>

2493
01:55:31,756 --> 01:55:33,589
Unless you decide...

2494
01:55:33,591 --> 01:55:34,823
You're not gonna give up
the money.

2495
01:55:34,825 --> 01:55:36,859
You're not gonna give up
the money.

2496
01:55:36,861 --> 01:55:37,993
You've come this far.

2497
01:55:37,995 --> 01:55:39,597
You've come this far.

2498
01:55:40,265 --> 01:55:42,267
Just one step further,

2499
01:55:42,933 --> 01:55:45,768
just one last act.

2500
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:47,972
In for a penny, in for a pound.

2501
01:55:50,641 --> 01:55:52,576
You decide you are in.

2502
01:55:57,315 --> 01:55:58,781
<i>Step one...</i>

2503
01:55:59,884 --> 01:56:02,887
<i>Destroy all evidence
of Marta's innocence.</i>

2504
01:56:09,261 --> 01:56:10,726
<i>Step two,</i>

2505
01:56:10,728 --> 01:56:13,028
<i>send her the anonymous email</i>

2506
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:15,633
<i>with a late morning
rendezvous time...</i>

2507
01:56:19,003 --> 01:56:22,073
<i>And deliver her
the blackmail note.</i>

2508
01:56:24,675 --> 01:56:26,409
<i>Step three,</i>

2509
01:56:26,411 --> 01:56:28,979
<i>keep your
appointment with Fran.</i>

2510
01:56:30,681 --> 01:56:32,714
Oh, I knew it.

2511
01:56:32,716 --> 01:56:35,385
I knew you were a no-good
son of a bitch.

2512
01:56:35,387 --> 01:56:37,886
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

2513
01:56:37,888 --> 01:56:39,688
Yes, Fran,
you were right.

2514
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:41,990
I knew you were
guilty as shit.

2515
01:56:41,992 --> 01:56:44,327
And now
you're gonna pay for it!

2516
01:56:44,329 --> 01:56:45,961
Don't you come near me.

2517
01:56:45,963 --> 01:56:48,664
Don't come near me!
I'm warning you!

2518
01:56:57,975 --> 01:57:00,376
<i>See, now,
now the board is set.</i>

2519
01:57:00,378 --> 01:57:02,245
<i>Marta will get
the blackmail note.</i>

2520
01:57:02,247 --> 01:57:04,280
<i>You'll put the pieces
together for her.</i>

2521
01:57:04,282 --> 01:57:06,216
<i>You'll guide her
to the rendezvous.</i>

2522
01:57:06,218 --> 01:57:08,384
<i>You'll make the anonymous call
to the police,</i>

2523
01:57:08,386 --> 01:57:09,486
<i>they will catch her there</i>

2524
01:57:09,488 --> 01:57:11,454
<i>with the body
and the burned evidence.</i>

2525
01:57:11,456 --> 01:57:14,390
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran

2526
01:57:14,392 --> 01:57:15,860
and Harlan.

2527
01:57:16,794 --> 01:57:17,926
She said...

2528
01:57:17,928 --> 01:57:19,231
You did this.

2529
01:57:20,731 --> 01:57:22,232
She didn't say...

2530
01:57:22,234 --> 01:57:23,235
"You did this."

2531
01:57:24,702 --> 01:57:26,702
She wasn't talking about me,
she said...

2532
01:57:26,704 --> 01:57:28,937
Hugh did this.

2533
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:30,839
"Hugh did this."

2534
01:57:30,841 --> 01:57:33,111
'Cause you made the help
call you Hugh.

2535
01:57:34,379 --> 01:57:35,813
'Cause you're an asshole.

2536
01:57:37,182 --> 01:57:39,282
And it would have worked

2537
01:57:39,284 --> 01:57:41,750
if we hadn't have brought you
in for questioning

2538
01:57:41,752 --> 01:57:44,487
<i>so you could not make
your anonymous call.</i>

2539
01:57:44,489 --> 01:57:45,988
<i>And if Fran had not stashed</i>

2540
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:48,491
a safety copy of the tox report.

2541
01:57:48,493 --> 01:57:52,730
And if Marta had not
outplayed you once again.

2542
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:55,300
<i>By having a kind heart.</i>

2543
01:57:57,768 --> 01:58:00,203
<i>By saving Fran's life</i>

2544
01:58:00,205 --> 01:58:02,372
<i>though it meant
her losing the inheritance</i>

2545
01:58:02,374 --> 01:58:03,506
<i>and going to jail.</i>

2546
01:58:03,508 --> 01:58:06,509
She didn't play your game.

2547
01:58:06,511 --> 01:58:08,280
She saved Fran's life.

2548
01:58:11,749 --> 01:58:12,750
Fran's alive?

2549
01:58:13,451 --> 01:58:15,050
Oh, yes.

2550
01:58:15,052 --> 01:58:16,785
Fran...

2551
01:58:16,787 --> 01:58:20,356
...who will confirm
this very story

2552
01:58:20,358 --> 01:58:21,725
or something close to it.

2553
01:58:22,927 --> 01:58:26,063
And send you, Hugh,

2554
01:58:26,764 --> 01:58:27,765
to jail.

2555
01:58:32,304 --> 01:58:33,305
Yes?

2556
01:58:37,142 --> 01:58:38,776
Doctor, that's great news.

2557
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:41,379
We'll be there soon.
Thank you.

2558
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:47,152
She's okay.

2559
01:58:48,018 --> 01:58:50,018
She's ready to talk.

2560
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:51,853
Trooper Wagner,
if you could, uh,

2561
01:58:51,855 --> 01:58:53,189
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

2562
01:58:53,191 --> 01:58:56,192
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself,

2563
01:58:56,194 --> 01:58:58,094
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

2564
01:58:58,096 --> 01:58:59,397
All right.
Up, come on.

2565
01:59:05,836 --> 01:59:07,836
I'm gonna say this
just to you.

2566
01:59:07,838 --> 01:59:09,172
No cameras, no courtroom,

2567
01:59:09,174 --> 01:59:10,908
just you,
'cause you know it's true.

2568
01:59:11,875 --> 01:59:13,842
We allowed you
into our home.

2569
01:59:13,844 --> 01:59:15,278
We let you watch
our granddad,

2570
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,045
we welcomed you
into our family.

2571
01:59:17,047 --> 01:59:19,349
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

2572
01:59:19,351 --> 01:59:22,485
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home,

2573
01:59:22,487 --> 01:59:24,254
our birthright,

2574
01:59:24,256 --> 01:59:27,156
our ancestral family home?

2575
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:30,593
That is hooey.

2576
01:59:30,595 --> 01:59:32,595
Harlan, he bought
this place in the '80s

2577
01:59:32,597 --> 01:59:34,597
from a Pakistani
real estate billionaire.

2578
01:59:34,599 --> 01:59:36,466
Oh, shut up, Blanc!
Shut up!

2579
01:59:36,468 --> 01:59:40,538
Shut up with that Kentucky
Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl!

2580
01:59:41,606 --> 01:59:43,872
Yeah, I killed Fran.
But I guess I didn't.

2581
01:59:43,874 --> 01:59:45,441
So what do you have on me?

2582
01:59:45,443 --> 01:59:47,310
Nothing.
What, attempted murder?

2583
01:59:47,312 --> 01:59:50,012
I get arson for the building,
and a few other charges.

2584
01:59:50,014 --> 01:59:52,181
With a good lawyer,
which I have,

2585
01:59:52,183 --> 01:59:53,416
I'll be out in no time.

2586
01:59:53,418 --> 01:59:55,318
And then you'll see
just how much hell

2587
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:56,985
I can wreak on your life,

2588
01:59:56,987 --> 01:59:59,823
you vicious little bitch.

2589
02:00:07,098 --> 02:00:08,564
What the shit!

2590
02:00:09,634 --> 02:00:11,367
That means
she's lying!

2591
02:00:11,369 --> 02:00:12,934
Yeah, man, we know.

2592
02:00:12,936 --> 02:00:13,937
That's right.

2593
02:00:14,872 --> 02:00:15,873
Fran's dead.

2594
02:00:20,178 --> 02:00:22,347
And you just confessed
to her murder.

2595
02:00:35,059 --> 02:00:36,060
Well...

2596
02:00:37,329 --> 02:00:38,363
In for a penny...

2597
02:01:23,141 --> 02:01:24,142
Shit.

2598
02:02:57,435 --> 02:02:58,436
Linda!

2599
02:02:58,770 --> 02:02:59,869
Linda!

2600
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:02,440
We've gotta get the attorneys
on the phone right now!

2601
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:04,209
We...

2602
02:03:10,381 --> 02:03:11,514
<i>Can I ask</i>

2603
02:03:11,516 --> 02:03:13,516
<i>when did you know
I had something to do</i>

2604
02:03:13,518 --> 02:03:15,251
<i>with Harlan's death?</i>

2605
02:03:15,253 --> 02:03:17,253
Oh, from the first moment

2606
02:03:17,255 --> 02:03:18,723
you set foot in front of me.

2607
02:03:24,061 --> 02:03:24,993
Oh, shit.

2608
02:03:24,995 --> 02:03:27,096
I want you
to remember something

2609
02:03:27,098 --> 02:03:28,333
that's very important.

2610
02:03:29,501 --> 02:03:30,700
You won,

2611
02:03:30,702 --> 02:03:33,571
not by playing the game
Harlan's way,

2612
02:03:34,372 --> 02:03:35,440
but yours.

2613
02:03:37,775 --> 02:03:39,177
You're a good person.

2614
02:03:41,379 --> 02:03:42,714
This family.

2615
02:03:49,187 --> 02:03:51,356
I should help them. Right?

2616
02:03:52,223 --> 02:03:54,592
Well, I have my opinion,

2617
02:03:56,227 --> 02:03:58,496
but I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.
