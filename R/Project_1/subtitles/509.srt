2
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,881
Ew, Mom, I'm trying
to eat breakfast.

3
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,149
Almost done.

4
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:16,619
Aw, your mustache
is really coming in.

5
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:18,888
Mom!

6
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:22,825
- Phoebe!
- Ow!

7
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,595
I'm bleeding!
You made me bleed!

8
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,964
You'll live. Phoebe!

9
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:30,431
Oh! What are you doing?

10
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,268
Neighbor's electricity
is running out of phase.

11
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,770
- I tied in, bumped us up to 220.
- Take that off.

12
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,005
Now I can run my lathe.

13
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:38,140
And you didn't think
to ask me?

14
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,843
I mean, you just demonstrate
zero aptitude for science.

15
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:43,112
- Uh-huh, got it.
- You're better at other things.

16
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:45,413
- Like quesadillas.
- My hair dryer.

17
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,483
- Your quesadillas are excellent.
- Thank you.

18
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:48,951
Now what?

19
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,619
Mom!

20
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:53,656
- Really? You don't have legs?
- I'm not an adult.

21
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,562
I'm literally driving
to pick up a check right now.

22
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:00,830
You win lottery?

23
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,565
Kind of. My father died.

24
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:04,300
Relax.
I didn't even know him.

25
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,734
I'm surprised
he left me anything.

26
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,236
- Sounds like my father.
- Yeah?

27
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,871
Did your dad
abandon your family

28
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:11,040
and move to a farm
in the middle of nowhere?

29
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:12,808
No.

30
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,543
Look, I...

31
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:18,147
I know I have not been
a reliable or consistent tenant.

32
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,482
But if you give me a week
to settle loose ends,

33
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:22,551
I'll be back
with everything I owe.

34
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:26,789
I can fix that!

35
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,157
Listen,

36
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,192
I wait for you to leave,

37
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:32,393
then I change locks.

00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,409
This is where
your grandfather lived.

54
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:22,611
And died.

55
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,914
Ah, come on.
Not a single bar?

56
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:27,016
There'd better be a bar.

57
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:28,550
That's funny.

58
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:44,633
"Behold,

59
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:47,269
"there was a great earthquake.

00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,605
"The sun became
as black as cloth,

61
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,407
"the seas boiled,

62
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,709
"the moon became as blood,

63
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,377
"the skies fell.

00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:56,912
Revelation 6:12."

65
00:07:58,347 --> 00:07:59,982
That was normal.

66
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,785
Hey, maybe it's a good thing
you never met your dad.

67
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:17,066
Great. You didn't tell us
we inherited a murder house.

68
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:21,236
And just think.

69
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,405
Now all of this is ours.

70
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,786
Pheebs, be a dear and break
into your grandfather's house.

71
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,143
Nice.

72
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,049
Oh, boy.

73
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:13,956
Not a single photo.

74
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,173
Rats.

75
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,514
You gotta see the gold mine
of junk I found out back.

76
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:38,714
Great.

77
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:41,850
Oh, my God,
this is so much worse

78
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,752
than I thought it was gonna be.

79
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:57,900
Under the dining table now!

80
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,570
Phoebe.

81
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,607
Remember that summer
we died under a table?

82
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:07,876
Of course this place is built
on a fault line.

83
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,211
Probably just fracking.

84
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,180
It's fracking annoying,
is what it is.

85
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,783
It's okay,
we're only here for a week.

86
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,287
Um, give or take.

87
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:22,091
What does that mean?

88
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:26,395
It means we're staying.

89
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,430
You said we'd
only be here for a week!

90
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah, well, that was
before we got evicted.

91
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,801
You said
you had money saved up.

92
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,038
- That was before I had children.
- Oh!

93
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:38,307
To be fair, you've never
been good with money.

94
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,808
Thanks, Pheebs.

95
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,948
What's that?

96
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,316
How am I supposed to know?

97
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:53,155
Can I help you?

98
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,965
Um, hi. We're...
We're the, um... The...

99
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:04,666
This was my father's place.

100
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:10,072
Hi.

101
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:11,273
Hi.

102
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,944
I'm, uh, Janine Melnitz.
We spoke on the phone.

103
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,346
I was your father's...

104
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,681
You know, we were friends.

105
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,518
- Very sorry for your loss.
- It's okay.

106
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,319
You knew him better than me.
I should be sorry for your loss.

107
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:26,489
I just tried to keep
the bills paid on time,

108
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,491
- that kind of thing.
- Like a money manager?

109
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,826
Oh, there was
no money to manage.

110
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,995
He could barely keep
the power on.

111
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,031
So he left us nothing?

112
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,835
Well, I wouldn't say that.

113
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,070
There is quite a bit of debt.

114
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:47,209
Ms. Melnitz,
I'm here to sign forms,

115
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:50,379
pack the silverware
and leave with a rent check.

116
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:52,981
Are you telling me
this place is worthless?

117
00:11:53,115 --> 00:11:55,652
You mean, aside from
the sentimental value?

00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,503
- Yeah, probably.
- Where's my order?

121
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,406
I can't believe
a place like this still exists.

122
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,309
I can't believe we have
to spend a summer in this heap.

123
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:22,645
- We have lives.
- You don't think I have a life?

124
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:24,379
No. You're a mom.
You live for us.

- Make them out of what?
- I'm serious.

134
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:56,245
A new home could be
an opportunity to start fresh.

135
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:57,813
Just keep an open mind.

136
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,564
Two taters, three Spinners,
grilled onions, one no cheese.

137
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,965
Lucky, there's... There's
something wrong with the meat.

- There's something wrong.

- Heh-heh-heh!

140
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:23,071
Cool place.

141
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:25,475
Yeah, I'll use that.

142
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:27,876
I don't own it.

143
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,712
I know you don't own it.

144
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,714
You look pretty young
to own a business.

145
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:37,487
I saw the sign out front.
"Help wanted"?

146
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:40,590
I... I can be helpful.

147
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:45,961
Under experience, you put
"friendly" with a smiley face?

148
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:47,597
I didn't really know
what to put.

149
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,365
I don't think "friendly"
qualifies as an experience.

150
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,334
It's a quality, I guess.

151
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:58,474
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

152
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:00,942
Think you can put in
a good word for me?

153
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:02,712
I can tell them
you have a pulse.

154
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:03,979
My name's Trevor.

155
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,516
My name's Trevor.

156
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,950
- Dude, that was great.
- Dude, that was really cute.

157
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,721
You have a chance with her.
You really do.

158
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,490
Mmm.

159
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,793
So where you heading?

160
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:18,427
We're staying, actually.

161
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:21,263
You know that farmhouse
off the highway with the barn?

162
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:23,265
Dirt? It was my father's.

163
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:26,034
Dirt Farmer had a family?

164
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:28,136
You knew my father?

165
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,640
No one knew your father.

166
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,675
Well, I'm sure he'll be missed.

167
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,276
Nope.

168
00:14:42,284 --> 00:14:43,185
Whoa!

169
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:45,854
What's up, Casanova?

170
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,780
Ow.

171
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,891
Damn it.

172
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,967
What?

173
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,605
Come on! Bus leaves in 15!

174
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,820
Hey, Pheebs, at school today,

175
00:16:57,954 --> 00:17:00,055
don't be afraid
to just start a conversation.

176
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:01,990
Are you kidding?
That's horrible advice.

177
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,159
You're literally setting her up
for failure.

178
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:07,195
Hey, how are the jokes
coming along?

179
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,364
Why should you
never trust atoms?

180
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,068
Because they
make up everything.

181
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:16,639
- That's funny.
- No, it's not.

182
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:19,007
- You can drop me off here.
- Are you embarrassed?

183
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,543
Yeah. Bye.

184
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:27,215
Love you!

185
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:33,021
- That almost killed you.
- Yeah, with your face.

186
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:36,157
- What's wrong? You love school.
- I love learning.

187
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,961
This is a state-sponsored
work camp for delinquents.

188
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:43,465
Fine. You can help me scrape
asbestos out of the attic.

189
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,301
I'll take my chances
with public education.

190
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:49,505
Hey, don't be yourself.

191
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,679
- You okay?
- Ah, yeah. First day.

192
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,047
Can you imagine who they've got
teaching summer school?

193
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,182
I can. I teach here.

194
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:02,785
Oh, I'm so sorry.

195
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,086
No, it's okay. It's...

196
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,024
Most of the kids that go here,
they're not very bright.

197
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:09,457
Hey, Colin.

198
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,528
He's...

199
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:14,697
I can kind of do
whatever I want.

200
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,965
Score.

201
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:16,966
- Right?
- Mm.

202
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:18,466
- Dream job.
- Mm-hm.

203
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:25,708
Good morning, class.
How's everybody doing today?

204
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,910
My name's Mr. Grooberson.

205
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:29,512
Um...

206
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,780
I know.

207
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:32,048
You don't wanna be here.

208
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,516
I don't wanna be here either.

209
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,785
Now, apparently,

210
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:38,888
your, uh, school is
still operating on VHS,

211
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:42,592
but, um, I found this gem
in the teachers' lounge.

212
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:44,125
It's great. It's called <i>Cujo.</i>

213
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,896
It's about
a rabid Saint Bernard that...

214
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,297
You know what? I don't
wanna give too much away.

215
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:52,068
But imagine Beethoven
if he contracted rabies

216
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,369
and just started
mauling children.

217
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,404
You'll get an idea.

218
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:57,773
Enjoy.

219
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:06,682
Speeding. Three, two, one.

220
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:09,952
She sits alone.

221
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:13,421
An outcast,
rejected by her peers.

222
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:15,024
But what is her secret?

223
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:17,593
Perhaps she's on the run.

224
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,796
On the run...

225
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,765
from herself.

226
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,533
And go.

227
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:27,970
Actually,
my grandfather died.

228
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:30,806
My mom says we're here to pick
through the rubble of his life.

229
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,977
So you're here to uncover
the mystery of his death?

230
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:36,277
No.

231
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:37,913
It was natural causes.

232
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:42,118
Are you sure
it wasn't unnatural causes?

233
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,686
Yes.

234
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,022
Pretty sure
it was just a heart attack.

235
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:48,924
Oh, the silent killer.

236
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,695
I'm Phoebe.

237
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:54,329
Oh, cool. Uh, I'm Podcast.

238
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:56,331
Why do people call you Podcast?

239
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,467
Oh, I call myself Podcast.
Because of my podcast.

240
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:06,475
- Doing some painting?
- Mm, yeah.

241
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:07,877
Whereabouts you staying?

242
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,047
Um, that old apocalyptic ranch
off of 99.

243
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,815
It was my father's place.

244
00:20:12,948 --> 00:20:15,051
Dirt Farmer had a family?

245
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,852
You all called him
the Dirt Farmer?

246
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:18,821
Meant nothing by it.

247
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:22,758
Man spends every week
working a piece of land...

248
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,161
but never seeding,
never watering,

249
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,328
never growing
a ding-dang thing.

250
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,931
It's curious behavior.

251
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,567
Great customer though.

252
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,070
He... He bought
some bizarre shit.

253
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:36,706
Yeah, that sounds like him.

254
00:21:00,763 --> 00:21:01,697
What is this?

255
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,067
Hello.

256
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,937
Um, you know, there's
a highly entertaining movie

257
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,238
about a killer dog
happening right over there.

258
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:13,709
- Is this a seismic map?
- Yes.

259
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:16,411
- How did you know that?
- It's a map of seismic activity.

260
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:18,614
- Right. But...
- You're a seismologist?

261
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:22,551
Does that seem
so hard to believe?

262
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,820
Figured you
for a football coach.

263
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,790
Oh.

264
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,892
Um, thank you.

265
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,695
These don't look
tectonic or volcanic.

266
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:35,965
Okay, smarty.

267
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,733
Here, check this out.

268
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,435
This is a volcano, all right?

269
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:44,305
It builds and crests.

270
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:47,243
But this is
a tectonic earthquake.

271
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,913
Notice a little P-wave
followed by a large S wave.

272
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:56,152
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

273
00:21:56,284 --> 00:22:00,455
Clearly. Well, this is
the pattern in Summerville.

274
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:05,094
Large P-wave, small S wave.
Like an explosion.

275
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:07,830
- Where is it coming from?
- I don't know. I don't know.

276
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,533
I set up geophones,
but I can't triangulate.

277
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,868
- Are you using three?
- Yeah.

278
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:15,171
I know how many sides
there are in a triangle.

279
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:17,873
I just thought
you were being obtuse.

280
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:23,112
Was that a geometry joke?

281
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:26,048
- Yes, that's why I winked.
- Ah.

282
00:22:26,182 --> 00:22:28,050
Uh, that's terrible.

283
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:29,552
No, I loved it.

284
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:32,054
Look at this.
I mean, somehow,

285
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:34,557
a town that isn't anywhere
near a tectonic plate,

286
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,993
that has no underground volcanic
activity, no fault lines,

287
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:40,196
no fracking,
no loud music even,

288
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:42,031
is shaking
on a daily basis.

289
00:22:44,266 --> 00:22:46,135
Maybe it's the apocalypse.

290
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:55,644
Twenty-three, 24, 25.

291
00:22:55,778 --> 00:22:59,014
Hey, no-skills. How's inventory?

292
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:01,150
Oh, hey, how's it going?
No, it's not good.

293
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:02,551
It's not good at all. Um...

294
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,020
- Does everyone do this?
- Yeah, it's important.

295
00:23:05,154 --> 00:23:06,589
You okay?

296
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,389
Your lips are literally blue.

297
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:09,758
Yeah, I'm fine.

298
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:11,193
You should borrow my hoodie.

299
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:12,895
No, it's fine. Seriously.

300
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,330
It's really masculine.

301
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:16,732
It's got a wolf on it.
Trust me.

302
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:18,100
Okay.

303
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,540
I'm kind of surprised
it fits me.

304
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:26,407
Yeah, it's my boyfriend's,
actually.

305
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,677
- Oh.
- Back to inventory.

306
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:34,116
Okay, we're speeding.
Three, two, one.

307
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,751
Uh, yeah,
just introduce yourself

308
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:37,920
and tell me
what you ate for breakfast.

309
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:40,022
Um, Phoebe.

310
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:41,957
Toast.

311
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:46,195
Okay, um, maybe a little more.
Tell me a joke or something.

312
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:48,564
- A joke?
- Mm-hm.

313
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,935
What do you call
a dead polar bear?

314
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:56,839
Anything you want.

315
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,574
It can't hear you now.

316
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:06,282
Wow. That was funny.

317
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:08,918
- You're funny.
- It's a pretty hilarious joke.

318
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:10,886
Fun fact:
Did you know Summerville

319
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,955
has more dead residents
than living ones?

320
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,491
Yeah, that's
how cemeteries work.

321
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:18,160
Wertheimers Hardware,
run by the Illuminati.

322
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:20,062
- Lizard people.
- Lizard people?

323
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,997
Jefferson, Einstein, Beyoncé?

324
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,099
How do you think
we got the pyramids?

325
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,001
- Slaves?
- Movie theater.

326
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,403
That one's haunted.

327
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:29,305
I don't believe in ghosts.

328
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,342
What? How can you...?

329
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:36,679
I mean, all the evidence!
You don't believe in spirits?

330
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:38,514
No.

331
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:41,784
I think we're all
just kind of meat puppets.

332
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,954
There's something
you need to see.

333
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:46,288
I'll grab my wheels.

334
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:56,498
Are we even allowed to be here?

335
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,400
Oh, yeah. Totally.

336
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,269
The mine's been closed
since the '40s.

337
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:01,937
They just put
all these signs up

338
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:04,106
'cause of
hazardous chemical leaks

339
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,108
and on account of dynamite.

340
00:25:06,241 --> 00:25:09,411
I do this. Hmm.

341
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:18,287
The whole town was basically
a mining operation.

342
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,489
They bore out this mountain
like a grapefruit

343
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:24,159
and smelted everything into
cold-riveted selenium girders.

344
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:25,828
Why would you
make a steel beam

345
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:28,397
out of an electro conductor
like selenium?

346
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:30,899
Right?

347
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,401
Weird.

348
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,803
Until one day,

349
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:37,306
they were forced to close down
the whole enchilada.

350
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,540
Why?

351
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:43,445
One by one,
miners who had worked for years

352
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,383
began leaping down
the mine shaft to their death.

353
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,184
They called it...

354
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:51,987
the Shandorian curse.

355
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:15,711
Who built these?

356
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:17,346
Depends who you believe.

357
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,082
One day, they just showed up
without explanation.

358
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,521
Cool.

359
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:54,517
What a shitbox.

360
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,887
So, what's
your podcast about?

361
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:01,723
Oh, um, mostly mysteries
and the unknown,

362
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:03,292
uh, conspiracy theories,

363
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:05,427
the occasional
restaurant review.

364
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:08,297
Well, maybe I could
check it out sometime.

365
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,599
- Really?
- Yeah.

366
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:19,408
The show really finds
its voice on Episode 46.

367
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,076
Okay.

368
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,611
Uh, hey.

369
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:25,114
Look, this is totally cool
if this is a no.

370
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:26,682
Uh, zero "presh."

371
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:29,519
Uh, but, um...

372
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:31,588
do you wanna
be my lab partner?

373
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:36,526
Well, I don't think
we're gonna be doing any labs,

374
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:38,193
but yeah.

375
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:39,928
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

376
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:42,164
Cool, cool. All right.

377
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:44,666
Yeah.

378
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:48,403
Well, this is me.

379
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:50,139
The Dirt Farmer's house?

380
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:53,809
- Yeah, he was my grandfather.
- No way, dude!

381
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:56,445
So you're just gonna walk in?

382
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:01,016
- Are you recording me?
- Yeah, just in case

383
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,018
your body's pulled apart
into tiny pieces

384
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:05,254
by an unseen dark force.

385
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,925
All right. Bye.

386
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,094
Okay, so this is happening.

387
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,087
Hello?

388
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,223
<i>No!</i>

389
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,095
<i>Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?</i>

390
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:41,436
I need to know
what's lurking inside.

391
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:44,906
- No way. Killer replica.
- Totally.

392
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,577
- A replica of what?
- A trap.

393
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:50,345
A ghost trap.

394
00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:56,251
Seriously? How do you of
all people not know about this?

395
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:59,321
- I'm ashamed.
- Oh, I was obsessed.

396
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:02,825
New York in the '80s,
it was like <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

397
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,594
- Then it just stopped?
- Mm-hm.

398
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,497
I mean, there hasn't been
a ghost sighting in 30 years.

399
00:32:19,174 --> 00:32:20,375
Wait a minute.

400
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,445
This thing is real?

401
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:25,013
- Absolutely.
- Maybe.

402
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,817
I found it
in my living room.

403
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,652
She lives on the Dirt Farm.

404
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:31,386
Oh, the really spooky one?

405
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,088
Yeah, the one
that says "dirt" on it.

406
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,793
What happened in New York?

407
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,294
The whole city was freaking out.

408
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:40,929
Then these physicists showed up

409
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:42,765
with these portable
proton accelerators

410
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,801
and blew the roof off
of a Manhattan high-rise.

411
00:32:49,772 --> 00:32:51,574
None of this rings a bell?

412
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,576
It happened 20 years
before we were born.

413
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:55,110
I believe it.

414
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:56,679
Ghostbusters!

415
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:58,614
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

416
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,720
I mean, your, uh, dad
never mentioned this?

417
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:06,121
It's just my mom.

418
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:08,390
Oh, just your mom. Oh.

419
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:11,159
Um, cool.

420
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,994
"Cool"?

421
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:15,163
I wonder if this still works.

422
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,233
Should we open it?

423
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:29,679
Glasses.

424
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:32,314
Two millimeters
of plastic eye protection?

425
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:33,683
Are you sure this is safe?

426
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:34,851
Safe?

427
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,886
Heh, no.

428
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,053
No.

429
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:39,689
History is safe.

430
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:41,691
Geometry, that's safe.

431
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:45,026
Science is all

432
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,830
particle accelerators
and hydrogen bombs.

433
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:49,732
Science is giving yourself
the plague

434
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:51,667
and gambling on the cure.

435
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,134
Science is reckless.

436
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:55,671
Totally! Yes!
It's punk rock.

437
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:58,073
It's a safety pin
through the nipple of academia.

438
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:01,443
- Ouch.
- Fire it up.

439
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:11,119
I've always wanted
to do this.

440
00:35:05,173 --> 00:35:07,108
Yes!

441
00:35:07,242 --> 00:35:09,110
Uh...

442
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:11,212
we should probably
get out of here.

443
00:35:11,346 --> 00:35:12,882
You're an adult.

444
00:35:13,015 --> 00:35:13,950
Yeah.

445
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:16,284
And liable.

446
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:20,221
You know what this means,
right?

447
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:23,124
Your grandfather
was a Ghostbuster.

448
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,961
Yes, I'm aware.

449
00:35:48,283 --> 00:35:51,020
It has a door and windows,

450
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,121
like any ordinary house.

451
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:54,924
But the distinct smell
of evil...

452
00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:58,694
...is prominent.

453
00:35:58,828 --> 00:36:00,029
What are you doing?

454
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:02,598
Oh, um,
giving a little color.

455
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,100
Setting the mood.

456
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:06,134
It's creepy.
I dig it.

457
00:36:10,106 --> 00:36:11,974
Wow.

458
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:13,441
Cool.

459
00:36:14,977 --> 00:36:18,279
Whoa. Aztec death whistle.

460
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:20,415
It's designed
to ward off evil spirits.

461
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,283
It's got
a really horrifying sound...

462
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:27,188
What...?

463
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:31,159
Um, what the hell is that?

464
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:33,194
Aztec death whistle.
Can I keep it?

465
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:35,598
Yes, please.
Just don't do that again.

466
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:39,467
Hi.

467
00:36:39,602 --> 00:36:40,736
Hello again.

468
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,339
You brought them home.

469
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:47,910
- It's a service I provide.
- Are...?

470
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:50,646
- Well, I'm also an escort.
- Mmm...?

471
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,848
- That came out wrong.
- Kind of... Yep.

472
00:36:52,982 --> 00:36:54,650
The truth is,
I've always wondered

473
00:36:54,784 --> 00:36:57,553
what lurked
inside this haunt box.

474
00:36:57,687 --> 00:37:00,056
Right. Well, the only thing
lurking inside here

475
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:01,891
is my slowly dying soul.

476
00:37:02,024 --> 00:37:03,559
Is that what that smell is?

477
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:06,261
Well, it's not dinner, so...

478
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,797
Well, all right.

479
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:13,069
- Um, would you...
- Sure.

480
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:15,037
- ...like...?
- Yeah.

481
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:16,706
I don't have any food.

482
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:17,973
- It's fine.
- Okay, tour.

483
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:19,340
- Great.
- Great.

484
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,578
Here's the dining room.

485
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:29,317
I think Grooberson's trying
to bone your mom.

486
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:33,321
Oh.

487
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:36,192
That doesn't bother you?

488
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:38,060
No, of course it bothers me.

489
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:41,597
I just don't exhibit emotions
the same way everyone else does.

490
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:43,866
Inside, I'm vomiting.

491
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:49,404
Wait.

492
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,440
Isn't this
what we saw earlier?

493
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:01,884
"The Sumerians believed
in a land of the dead,

494
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:06,789
"a dark and shadowy realm
within the bowels of the earth.

495
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:11,961
<i>"The souls of the dead are
ruled by a mighty god, Gozer,</i>

496
00:38:12,094 --> 00:38:15,463
"and protected
by a powerful Gatekeeper

497
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:18,934
"and Keymaster, in order
that Gozer might rise up

498
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:21,269
"and walk the human plane again.

499
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:25,708
The Gatekeeper and Keymaster
must assume the form of beasts."

500
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:29,812
What did we let out?

501
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:35,316
Yum.

502
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,153
Has this ever
been cleaned before?

503
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:38,621
Not by me.

504
00:38:38,754 --> 00:38:40,856
We're heading up the mountain.

505
00:38:42,691 --> 00:38:43,626
You coming?

506
00:38:57,106 --> 00:39:03,212

Rivers are like

514
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:30,706
Basically,
when you think about it.

515
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,062
Why'd you bring me up here?

516
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:56,765
Entertainment value.

517
00:39:56,899 --> 00:39:58,767
Can you juggle?

518
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:05,341
- It's not funny.
- What are you doing here

519
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:06,909
in Summerville anyway?

520
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:12,681
Honestly, my mom won't say it,
but we're broke.

521
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:15,551
We got evicted, and the only
thing that's left in our name

522
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:17,586
is this creepy, old farmhouse
our grandfather left us

523
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,889
in the middle of nowhere.

524
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:21,924
No offense.

525
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,059
I'm not offended.

526
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:26,028
This place is a dump.

527
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:29,698
Then why do you live here?

528
00:40:29,832 --> 00:40:32,568
I'm fourth-generation dump,
so...

529
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:33,736
Oh.

530
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:38,240
You think you'll ever leave?

531
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:44,246
I mean, if I don't,
what does that say about me?

532
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,916
You don't have a car.

533
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,985
What the hell? Get out.

534
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,326
What is that?

535
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:58,327
I don't know.

536
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:02,965
<i>Gozer.</i>

537
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:13,609
What was that?

538
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:22,084
It's not funny.

539
00:41:24,186 --> 00:41:26,155
What is this?

540
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:29,425
- That's a map.
- Yeah, I know it's a...

541
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:32,061
A map. But this...

542
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:35,130
This thing's ancient. It's
written in a kind of cuneiform.

543
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:37,433
Oh, yeah?

544
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:39,335
This is Summerville.

545
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,503
- That doesn't make sense.
- No, not at all.

546
00:41:41,637 --> 00:41:44,340
Summerville's not even 100
years old, but this is written

547
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:46,108
in a language
from thousands of years ago.

548
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:48,677
For all I know,
that's the language he spoke.

549
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:51,613
That's it?

550
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:53,349
You don't think
this is incredible

551
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:55,517
and bizarre and fascinating?

552
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,787
Can I have this?

553
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:00,489
Yeah, sure. Weirdo.

554
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:02,958
That's how it starts.
First there's a map.

555
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:04,660
Then you move
into a haunted house.

556
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:07,796
Then everyone's calling you
the Dirt Farmer.

557
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,165
What about Phoebe?
Think she'd want any of this?

558
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:13,535
Oh, I'm sure
Phoebe will find something.

559
00:43:03,152 --> 00:43:04,286
Hello?

560
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:03,138
Two of the CRT emitters
are missing.

561
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:11,481
Thanks.

562
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,699
How on earth did you build
such a small cyclotron?

563
00:45:32,868 --> 00:45:35,470
Got it. You're a genius.

564
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:41,076
Needle-nose pliers?

565
00:45:50,152 --> 00:45:53,088
<i>Are you troubled by
strange noises in the night?</i>

566
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:54,856
<i>Do you experience
feelings of dread</i>

567
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,258
<i>in your basement or attic?</i>

568
00:45:56,391 --> 00:45:57,893
<i>Have you or any of your family</i>

569
00:45:58,026 --> 00:45:59,629
<i>ever seen a spook, specter
or ghost?</i>

570
00:45:59,761 --> 00:46:00,896
<i>If the answer is yes,</i>

571
00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:02,532
<i>don't wait another minute.</i>

572
00:46:02,665 --> 00:46:04,900
- <i>Call the professionals.</i>
- <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

<i>Our courteous and efficient

00:46:07,936 --> 00:46:10,239

00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:11,940
<i>We're ready to believe you.</i>

576
00:46:12,074 --> 00:46:13,976
Hey, you're awake.

577
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,211
What are you up to?

578
00:46:16,345 --> 00:46:17,547
Experiments.

579
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,649
Ugh, lame.

580
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:21,984
Oh, you found popcorn.

581
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,454
What kind of scientist
was Grandpa?

582
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:27,657
The kind
that repels loved ones.

583
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,827
- Maybe a physicist?
- Sure.

584
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,598
So tomorrow I was thinking
of grabbing dinner with Gary.

585
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:38,133
Who's Gary?

586
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:39,901
Mr. Grooberson.

587
00:46:41,003 --> 00:46:43,640
His name is Gary Grooberson?

588
00:46:43,772 --> 00:46:45,774
You have a date
with Gary Grooberson.

589
00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:47,209
It's just dinner.

590
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:48,877
Good night, Phoebe.

591
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:51,748
Don't be yourself.

592
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:21,810
Welcome to Rust City.

593
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:24,614
This is where they processed
all the raw selenium?

594
00:47:24,747 --> 00:47:25,847
Yeah, I guess.

595
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:33,355
Cool.

596
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:36,124
How'd you
know how to fix it?

597
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:38,293
I mean, no offense,
but you are 12.

598
00:47:38,427 --> 00:47:41,497
I kind of met
my grandfather last night.

599
00:47:41,631 --> 00:47:43,700
He showed me what to do.

600
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:47,102
No way. Was he, like,
howling and clanking chains?

601
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:50,138
- No. That would've been weird.
- Oh.

602
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:51,440
Switch me on.

603
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,658
Safety's off.

604
00:48:44,025 --> 00:48:45,427
Her feet are planted.

605
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:47,162
Her face is poised.

606
00:48:47,295 --> 00:48:49,164
Will this be
the moment of her death?

607
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:51,099
Nobody knows.

608
00:48:58,741 --> 00:49:00,175
Yeah!

609
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:02,545
Whoo!

610
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:10,553
Oh, my gosh.

611
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:12,755
That is the best thing
I've ever seen.

612
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:19,896
Did I hit it?

613
00:49:21,798 --> 00:49:24,166
You didn't hit it.
You destroyed it!

614
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:27,302
It doesn't even exist anymore!

615
00:49:27,436 --> 00:49:28,671
My turn.

616
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:35,745
What was that?

617
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:38,447
Probably a pigeon or something.
Give me the gun.

618
00:49:42,184 --> 00:49:43,920
What is that?

619
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:46,923
Come on.

620
00:49:49,024 --> 00:49:50,425
Hold on.

621
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,597
- You coming?
- I'm coming.

622
00:50:18,253 --> 00:50:20,790
I gotta come back here
for my Halloween episode.

623
00:51:16,244 --> 00:51:17,580
It's a ghost.

624
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:22,284
A-aren't you just a little bit
freaked out right now?

625
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:24,754
Overstimulation calms me.

626
00:51:50,813 --> 00:51:53,883
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What's that for?

627
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:55,017
I have a plan.

628
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,786
Wait!

629
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,411
- Get the trap!
- Okay.

630
00:52:37,093 --> 00:52:38,861
I got him!

631
00:52:38,995 --> 00:52:40,161
Quick!

632
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:44,100
- Nuggets! Aah!
- Catch him!

633
00:53:10,258 --> 00:53:11,694
Okay.

634
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:17,133
Ugh, come on!

635
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:22,571
Come on, you can do this.

636
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,576
Come on, darling.

637
00:53:34,382 --> 00:53:35,316
Yes!

638
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:50,365

Hey.

650
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:34,375
This is Podcast.

651
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,945
He... He's my friend.

652
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:38,246
- You have a friend?
- You have a car?

653
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,315
Yeah, it's a Cadillac.

654
00:54:40,448 --> 00:54:42,317
Hey, dude. We need a ride.

655
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,620
- Do you know how to drive?
- He doesn't.

656
00:54:44,754 --> 00:54:47,223
He failed his driver's test
three times.

657
00:54:47,355 --> 00:54:48,557
Get in the back.

658
00:54:53,562 --> 00:54:55,698
- Thank you.
- It sounds crazy,

659
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:58,299
but Oklahoma never had
earthquakes. For centuries.

660
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:01,871
But then, between 2010 and 2016,
they had like a thousand.

661
00:55:02,004 --> 00:55:03,139
Oh, jeez, what happened?

662
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:05,708
Oil and gas,
that's what happened.

663
00:55:05,841 --> 00:55:08,077
Yeah, they started pumping
millions of gallons

664
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,279
of salinated water deep
into the Arbuckle Formation.

665
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:13,115
And then
the porous limestone...

666
00:55:15,951 --> 00:55:17,987
Are you drunk?
Or are you just really bored?

667
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,256
Because I think
I can see you falling asleep.

668
00:55:20,388 --> 00:55:23,291
Uh, I just have, uh,
an allergy to science.

669
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,628
Uh-huh.
Have you tried Benadryl?

670
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:28,130
- I've tried, um, whiskey.
- It's better than Benadryl.

671
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:31,366
But science is amazing.
Science is pure.

672
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,468
It's an absolute.

673
00:55:33,602 --> 00:55:35,671
I mean, it's an answer
to all the madness.

674
00:55:36,906 --> 00:55:38,306
Why don't you like science?

675
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:41,610
Was, uh... Was Phoebe's dad
a scientist, or...?

676
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:43,813
- Oh, gross. No.
- No?

677
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:45,781
I'm making an assumption.

678
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:49,485
What's his deal?

679
00:55:49,618 --> 00:55:51,452
Honestly, I don't...
It doesn't matter.

680
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:55,090
He was fine with Trevor, but
with Phoebe, he just really...

681
00:55:55,224 --> 00:55:57,259
He couldn't connect
with her, so...

682
00:55:57,392 --> 00:56:00,596
Right. Well, he sounds
like a royal dirtbag.

683
00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:02,932
Oh, no, he was actually
just a very ordinary dirtbag.

684
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:07,368
Well, hey, at least, uh,
Phoebe turned out okay, right?

685
00:56:07,503 --> 00:56:09,104
I hope so.

686
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:10,506
I don't know.

687
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:12,708
She really keeps me
on the outside.

688
00:56:12,842 --> 00:56:16,979
She's just an awkward,
nerdy kid, but she's awesome.

689
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,014
I think she's great.

690
00:56:19,148 --> 00:56:21,349
I think you're great.
You're a great mom.

691
00:56:21,483 --> 00:56:23,152
Yeah. You showed up. You win.

692
00:56:24,452 --> 00:56:25,988
I just wish she'd relax,
you know?

693
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:29,258
- Just get into some trouble.
- There's plenty of time for that.

694
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:31,026
Maybe she'll take up
pole dancing.

695
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,930
- She's not very coordinated.
- Oh, I don't think that matters.

696
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,738
So, what the hell is going on?

697
00:56:42,872 --> 00:56:45,174
In the 1980s,
New York City was attacked.

698
00:56:45,307 --> 00:56:47,408
I know
the Manhattan ghost stories.

699
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:49,879
- The stories are real.
- Yeah, and so were the guys

700
00:56:50,012 --> 00:56:51,981
who climbed a building
and saved the world

701
00:56:52,114 --> 00:56:54,350
and fought back
an invading army of the undead.

702
00:56:54,483 --> 00:56:57,019
Not to mention
a 100-foot marshmallow man.

703
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:02,491
Our grandfather
was Egon Spengler.

704
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:03,893
He was a Ghostbuster.

705
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:05,761
<i>All units,</i>

706
00:57:05,895 --> 00:57:08,330
<i>we're getting reports of,
well, some kind of animal</i>

707
00:57:08,463 --> 00:57:10,900

708
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:13,401
<i>Apparently, he almost took
the whole tailgate off?</i>

709
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:15,604
- Muncher.
- Muncher.

710
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:40,229
- What should I be looking for?
- Evidence.

711
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:57,579
Can you stop breathing
in my ear?

712
00:57:57,713 --> 00:57:59,148
No.

713
00:57:59,281 --> 00:58:00,783
You guys,
this is kind of stupid.

714
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:03,451
Are you sure you didn't see,
like, a raccoon

715
00:58:03,585 --> 00:58:06,055
or, like, a possum?

716
00:58:06,188 --> 00:58:07,089
There!

717
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,928
Is that a...?

718
00:58:13,062 --> 00:58:14,763
Free-floating metal muncher.

719
00:58:14,897 --> 00:58:15,898
Definitely Class Five.

720
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:18,067
Okay, uh, what do we do?

721
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,935
Let's get him.

722
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:21,403
What?

723
00:58:21,537 --> 00:58:22,771
Let me get a photo first.

724
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:27,276
Guys?

725
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:28,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

726
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:32,314
Whoa. It has a gunner seat?

727
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:45,327
Go, go, go!

728
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:47,496
Whoa!

729
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:03,946
Whoa!

730
00:59:23,799 --> 00:59:24,700
What the...?

731
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:31,774
Uh...

732
00:59:40,716 --> 00:59:43,185
- Yes!
- Trap him!

733
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,170
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

734
01:00:10,012 --> 01:00:11,213
Come on, keep it straight.

735
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:12,881
You try driving this thing.

736
01:00:16,553 --> 01:00:18,087
Left, left, left!

737
01:00:35,538 --> 01:00:37,574
- Ready!
- Trap him already!

738
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:39,675
- Three, two...
- Three, two, one...

739
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:53,755
♪ On the road again... ♪

740
01:01:02,764 --> 01:01:04,466
Oh, my God,
what just happened?

741
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,403
He's heading for
the mountain.

742
01:01:21,484 --> 01:01:23,352
- Closer.
- Okay.

743
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:24,987
I'm in range.

744
01:01:55,652 --> 01:01:57,085
She got him!

745
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:10,500
Whatever we're doing,
we have to do it now.

746
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:13,368
Come on!

747
01:02:26,148 --> 01:02:27,015
- Yes!
- Yeah!

748
01:02:27,149 --> 01:02:28,417
Bridge!

749
01:02:54,076 --> 01:02:55,210
What was that?

750
01:02:55,344 --> 01:02:57,145
I think we just caught
a ghost.

751
01:03:02,284 --> 01:03:03,285
Ugh!

752
01:03:03,418 --> 01:03:04,319
Sorry.

753
01:03:06,154 --> 01:03:08,056
I was here last night.

754
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:21,704
Does any of this bother you?

755
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:23,706
What do you mean?

756
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,974
Dude, your grandfather
was a legend.

757
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:28,544
You can literally be
anything you want.

758
01:03:28,678 --> 01:03:31,446
Like a influencer or a DJ.

759
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:33,650
It was easier when I thought
he went nuts.

760
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:35,117
- He didn't go nuts.
- Exactly.

761
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,418
So why did he leave Mom?

762
01:03:40,956 --> 01:03:43,358
Oh, no, no, no.

763
01:03:43,493 --> 01:03:45,160
We're screwed.
We're so screwed.

764
01:03:45,294 --> 01:03:47,530
- What do we do?
- I say we fight.

765
01:03:47,664 --> 01:03:50,098
What? No.
Just check the glove box.

766
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:55,304
License and registration.

767
01:03:56,673 --> 01:03:58,373
We were on that big mountain,

768
01:03:58,508 --> 01:04:01,611
and I went to go hang out with
this girl in this mining cage.

769
01:04:01,744 --> 01:04:04,379
All of a sudden, it started
shaking, like an earthquake.

770
01:04:04,514 --> 01:04:05,847
And there were lights,

771
01:04:05,981 --> 01:04:08,317
and then I looked down
in this giant hole.

772
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,520
Inside of it,
right in the middle of it,

773
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:13,822
was either a person
or a reptile...

774
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:15,692
Are you even
paying attention?

775
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:18,026
Yeah. I'm just excited
we're in jail.

776
01:04:19,629 --> 01:04:23,800
I thought I heard something
say, "Gozer."

777
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:27,469
He speaks the truth.
I was there.

778
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,374
Hey. Hi. How...?
What brings you here?

779
01:04:32,508 --> 01:04:35,110
Actually, you could help me
with hiding something.

780
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:36,679
- Yeah, yeah.
- Do you have priors?

781
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:38,180
'Cause they'll charge you
as a minor.

782
01:04:38,313 --> 01:04:39,649
You'll get two years. Max.

783
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:41,383
- Two?
- I'll visit you, okay?

784
01:04:41,517 --> 01:04:42,819
Lucky.

785
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:45,053
Quit messing with my inmates.

786
01:04:45,187 --> 01:04:46,723
Sorry, Dad.

787
01:04:47,956 --> 01:04:49,424
"Dad." So you're just...

788
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:54,029
Waiting for my ride. Yeah.

789
01:04:54,162 --> 01:04:56,264
But you look good behind bars.

790
01:04:57,533 --> 01:05:00,670
Hey. Don't we get a phone call?

791
01:05:00,803 --> 01:05:01,903
Sure you do.

792
01:05:04,474 --> 01:05:05,708
Who you gonna call?

793
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:09,512
Make it quick.

794
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:18,920
<i>Do you experience
feelings of dread</i>

795
01:05:19,054 --> 01:05:20,523
<i>in your basement
or attic?</i>

796
01:05:23,892 --> 01:05:25,227
<i>Have you
or any of your family</i>

797
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,329
<i>ever seen a spook, specter,
or ghost?</i>

798
01:05:29,799 --> 01:05:32,267
<i>If the answer is yes,
then don't wait another minute.</i>

799
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:34,604
<i>Pick up your phone
and call the professionals.</i>

800
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:54,791
Ray's Occult, and we're closed.

801
01:05:54,923 --> 01:05:57,325
<i>Wait!
I only get one phone call.</i>

802
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:58,728
I'm...

803
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:01,898
- in prison.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

804
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:04,634
The slammer, huh?
I've been there myself.

805
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,935
<i>I'm not a lawyer,
but I'm listening.</i>

806
01:06:08,704 --> 01:06:10,807
<i>Are you Ray Stantz,
the Ghostbuster?</i>

807
01:06:10,939 --> 01:06:13,709
- And now I'm hanging up.
- <i>Hang on. Please.</i>

808
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,979
I... I'm calling
about Egon Spengler.

809
01:06:22,785 --> 01:06:25,053
Egon Spengler can rot in hell.

810
01:06:30,058 --> 01:06:32,260
He died last week.

811
01:06:37,098 --> 01:06:38,333
Oh, man.

812
01:06:40,770 --> 01:06:42,070
No kidding.

813
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,476
Weren't you two friends?

814
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:48,310
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

815
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:51,112
What happened to you guys?

816
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:57,118
Oh, well, look, when we started,
busting ghosts was a gas.

817
01:06:57,252 --> 01:07:00,656
The economy was good.
Reagan years.

818
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,357
People believed in us.

819
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:05,393
Then things got slow,
hauntings got thin.

820
01:07:05,528 --> 01:07:08,330
Venkman thought
we did our job too well.

821
01:07:09,699 --> 01:07:12,502
We could barely keep up
our mortgage.

822
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:14,469
Some actor bought up
most of Tribeca,

823
01:07:14,604 --> 01:07:16,037
and we lost the firehouse.

824
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:17,640
It's a Starbucks now.

825
01:07:18,941 --> 01:07:21,042
So then you all
just walked away?

826
01:07:21,176 --> 01:07:22,979
Peter went back to academia.

827
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:25,615
He's at SUNY Cortland now.
He's a professor emeritus.

828
01:07:25,748 --> 01:07:28,350
He teaches advertising
and promotion.

829
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:29,819
Winston went into finance.

830
01:07:29,952 --> 01:07:31,854
He worked hard,
coined a fortune and...

831
01:07:31,988 --> 01:07:33,021
And I'm here.

832
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:37,860
- Well, what about Egon?
- <i>Well, he wasn't helping.</i>

833
01:07:37,994 --> 01:07:41,363
We went from ten calls a week
to one if we were lucky.

834
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:42,832
Egon started to tell people

835
01:07:42,965 --> 01:07:44,734
that their ghost problems
didn't matter

836
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:46,167
because the world
was coming to an end.

837
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:48,203
<i>He got spooky. Freaked me out.</i>

838
01:07:48,336 --> 01:07:49,572
One morning, I go to work

839
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:51,607
and Ecto-1, our old Cadillac,
is gone,

840
01:07:51,741 --> 01:07:54,610
his neutrona thrower,
collider pack, all the traps,

841
01:07:54,744 --> 01:07:57,178
16 ounces of fuel isotope,
all gone!

842
01:07:57,312 --> 01:07:58,413
He cleaned us out.

843
01:07:59,482 --> 01:08:01,017
Now we were the dead ones.

844
01:08:01,149 --> 01:08:02,919
Don't you think
he had a reason?

845
01:08:03,051 --> 01:08:05,287
He phoned me
about ten years later,

846
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,389
some small town in Oklahoma.

847
01:08:07,523 --> 01:08:09,759
He kept rambling
about "the rising storm"

848
01:08:09,892 --> 01:08:11,459
and "the huge psychic tornado"

849
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:15,397
that was gonna "consume
humanity in darkness forever."

850
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:17,567
And, kid, I wanted to believe.

851
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,735
You don't understand.
There is this mountain

852
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:21,571
and it has these
ancient carvings...

853
01:08:21,704 --> 01:08:23,405
<i>Kid, there are
a lot of mountains</i>

854
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:24,907
<i>with ancient carvings.</i>

855
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:27,944
Take a little advice.

856
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:29,779
Don't go chasing ghosts.

857
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,449
Egon Spengler
was my grandfather.

858
01:08:35,918 --> 01:08:36,852
Time's up.

859
01:08:38,253 --> 01:08:39,120
Hey, hello?

860
01:08:45,928 --> 01:08:47,797
- Where are my kids?
- They're in the lockup.

861
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,799
My children are not criminals.

862
01:08:49,932 --> 01:08:52,635
- Sure they're not.
- Driving without a license.

863
01:08:52,768 --> 01:08:56,072
Expired registration.
Speeding.

864
01:08:56,204 --> 01:08:58,306
They can't be the first
to go joyriding.

865
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,977
No, they are not.
But they are the first

866
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:04,245
to destroy half of Main Street
with whatever that thing is.

867
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:05,514
Whoa!

868
01:09:09,284 --> 01:09:11,353
- Sorry.
- What were you thinking?

869
01:09:11,487 --> 01:09:15,323
You know, you two could have
really hurt yourselves.

870
01:09:17,093 --> 01:09:18,594
Hey. I'm Gary.

871
01:09:18,728 --> 01:09:20,295
You process them out yet?

872
01:09:24,934 --> 01:09:26,602
Did you catch anything?

873
01:09:26,736 --> 01:09:27,770
It's inside the trap.

874
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:29,572
- Right now?
- Yes.

875
01:09:29,705 --> 01:09:31,674
Let's go. You were supposed
to look after her this summer.

876
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:33,476
- I was?
- Not you. Him.

877
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:34,844
This was her idea.

878
01:09:34,977 --> 01:09:37,113
But what about our stuff?
The Ecto-1?

879
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:40,281
Everything will remain nice
and safe in our impound locker.

880
01:09:40,415 --> 01:09:43,184
- No! We need it.
- Phoebe, let's go.

881
01:09:43,318 --> 01:09:45,286
We caught a ghost tonight.

882
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,090
- Dirt Farmer's family.
- It's true.

883
01:09:49,592 --> 01:09:50,993
And there will be more.

884
01:09:51,127 --> 01:09:53,729
You're starting to sound
like your lunatic grandfather.

885
01:09:55,463 --> 01:09:58,734
Phoebe! She didn't mean it.

886
01:09:58,868 --> 01:10:01,003
You wanna spend the night
in my jail?

887
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:07,643
You can... You can keep it.

888
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,816
Go. Now.

889
01:10:17,019 --> 01:10:20,056
- Trevor.
- I'll see you at work.

890
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:21,490
Yeah. See you.

891
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:24,192
Hey.

892
01:10:42,778 --> 01:10:43,913
All right, you guys.

893
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:45,413
Remember that...

894
01:10:45,548 --> 01:10:46,716
Yeah, you got it.

895
01:10:53,556 --> 01:10:55,256
I'm sorry the night
went sideways.

896
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,760
No. I-I had a blast.

897
01:10:57,893 --> 01:11:00,261
Why don't we just pick it up
tomorrow night, same time.

898
01:11:00,395 --> 01:11:02,932
- You really want more of this?
- Are you kidding me?

899
01:11:03,065 --> 01:11:06,135
We had kung pao shrimp.
We went to jail.

900
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:09,605
I don't know how we're gonna
top this. This is a home run.

901
01:11:13,175 --> 01:11:16,244
Um, my life is a dumpster fire.

902
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:19,715
I love dumpster fires.
You should see my apartment.

903
01:11:19,849 --> 01:11:22,752
I don't mean now.
Or a-anytime soon.

904
01:11:22,885 --> 01:11:26,188
You don't want to...
I'd need to clean...

905
01:11:26,321 --> 01:11:29,357
This is moving way too fast.
You gotta just relax.

906
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,328
The kids hungry?
They want some of this, uh,

907
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:35,564
unrefrigerated shrimp?

908
01:11:48,177 --> 01:11:50,546
- We're barely hanging on here.
- You don't understand.

909
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,248
I understand
you drove around town,

910
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,083
destroying
expensive property.

911
01:11:55,751 --> 01:11:58,319
Don't you think your father
came out here for a reason?

912
01:11:58,453 --> 01:11:59,822
No.

913
01:11:59,955 --> 01:12:02,658
No. I think
he was a sad old man

914
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:05,027
who turned his back
on his family, his partners.

915
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:08,664
And for what? For a stupid farm
in a town nobody cares about.

916
01:12:08,798 --> 01:12:11,133
Where, by the way,
everybody thought he was nuts.

917
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:13,334
Yeah, great decision, Dad.

918
01:12:14,804 --> 01:12:17,540
He was special.
He loved science, like me.

919
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:20,308
Why didn't you tell me my
grandfather was Egon Spengler?

920
01:12:23,444 --> 01:12:27,483
Hey, I'm glad you found yourself
here. I really am.

921
01:12:29,785 --> 01:12:31,086
But all I see are reminders

922
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,589
that I didn't mean a thing
to him.

923
01:12:33,722 --> 01:12:35,423
He never cared about me.

924
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,033
He's not nuts.

925
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:46,702
Well, then he's an asshole.

926
01:12:48,103 --> 01:12:50,005
Welcome to the family.

927
01:13:30,145 --> 01:13:31,146
Yeah.

928
01:13:46,795 --> 01:13:47,997
Jamoca.

929
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:50,766
There we go.

930
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,935
Strawberry, red velvet...

931
01:13:54,536 --> 01:13:55,571
Blue velvet?

932
01:14:51,894 --> 01:14:53,829
Aah! Ah.

933
01:15:17,086 --> 01:15:18,053
Oh, God.

934
01:16:36,165 --> 01:16:37,032
Hey...

935
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:25,114
Okay, so,
what exactly is happening with the map?

936
01:17:25,247 --> 01:17:27,449
See the concentric circles
around the mountain?

937
01:17:27,584 --> 01:17:28,650
No.

938
01:17:29,985 --> 01:17:32,654
- Do you see the circles?
- Yes.

939
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:35,290
Something's happening
inside that old mine.

940
01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:38,127
Yeah. I know that.
It's pretty obvious.

941
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:40,262
So I did some digging
on the word you heard

942
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:41,330
in the mountain. "Gozer."

943
01:17:41,463 --> 01:17:42,464
You did some digging?

944
01:17:42,599 --> 01:17:43,999
Gozer was a Sumerian god

945
01:17:44,133 --> 01:17:45,701
who once walked
amongst the living.

946
01:17:45,834 --> 01:17:47,970
A soul-eating,
flame-dripping deity of evil.

947
01:17:48,103 --> 01:17:49,606
And I think it wants back.

948
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:51,039
Here?

949
01:17:51,173 --> 01:17:53,208
I know.
I would've picked Orlando.

950
01:17:53,342 --> 01:17:55,612
What does the name Ivo Shandor
mean to you guys?

951
01:17:55,744 --> 01:17:58,615
Ivo Shandor?
He built this whole town.

952
01:17:58,747 --> 01:18:02,117
He built the mine, foundry,
the school, library.

953
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:04,286
- His name is on everything.
- That's tacky.

954
01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:06,489
In New York, he created
an apartment building

955
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:09,191
made out of selenium girders,
mined from right here.

956
01:18:09,324 --> 01:18:11,793
On that same rooftop is
where our grandfather fought

957
01:18:11,927 --> 01:18:14,463
to keep a horde of ghosts
from entering our dimension.

958
01:18:14,597 --> 01:18:17,799
Phoebe, what exactly
is happening here?

959
01:18:17,933 --> 01:18:20,637
I can only think of one way
for us to find out.

960
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:36,718
So, what do a cigarette
and hamster have in common?

961
01:18:38,921 --> 01:18:41,491
- What?
- They're both harmless

962
01:18:41,624 --> 01:18:44,226
until you stick one in your
mouth and light it on fire.

963
01:18:46,962 --> 01:18:48,565
The worst time.

964
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:13,690
Hey, guys, look.

965
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:40,650
Is that her?

966
01:19:42,351 --> 01:19:43,885
Is that Gozer?

967
01:19:44,019 --> 01:19:46,255
Gozer isn't he or she.

968
01:19:46,388 --> 01:19:49,057
Pretty woke for 3000 BC.

969
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:50,792
Everyone watch their steps.

970
01:19:52,461 --> 01:19:53,596
Another hole?

971
01:19:56,231 --> 01:19:58,568
I wonder where
this one leads to.

972
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:00,102
A sacrificial death pit.

973
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:02,804
What were they sacrificing?

974
01:20:02,938 --> 01:20:04,674
Virgins, probably.

975
01:20:04,806 --> 01:20:07,242
Tough luck for you, dude.
Sorry.

976
01:20:07,376 --> 01:20:10,178
Well, statistically,
most 15-year-olds are virgins.

977
01:20:10,312 --> 01:20:11,947
Shh! Oh...

978
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,550
Fifteen? You're 15?

979
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:17,487
I'll be 16 in February.

980
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,221
It's June.

981
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:22,424
What are those holes
in the wall?

982
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:27,764
They're vacancies.

983
01:20:29,398 --> 01:20:31,900
If this is a tomb,
where are all the bodies?

984
01:20:33,268 --> 01:20:34,403
Found one.

985
01:20:35,738 --> 01:20:36,938
Oh.

986
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,149
- What?
- Oh, my God.

987
01:20:47,282 --> 01:20:49,251
Is he sleeping?

988
01:20:49,384 --> 01:20:51,253
Dude, he's in a coffin.

989
01:20:51,386 --> 01:20:56,024
It's Ivo Shandor.
He's been in here for 75 years?

990
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:57,527
He looks fantastic.

991
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:00,329
You know when you die,
your fingernails keep growing.

992
01:21:00,462 --> 01:21:02,464
Not true.
Your skin just shrinks.

993
01:21:02,598 --> 01:21:04,634
Something was
coming and he knew it.

994
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:09,137
I think these are years.

995
01:21:11,173 --> 01:21:12,374
1883.

996
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:15,778
The Krakatoa eruption.

997
01:21:15,911 --> 01:21:18,413
The most violent volcanic
activity in human history.

998
01:21:18,548 --> 01:21:20,817
What happened in 1908?

999
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:23,753
Probably the
Tunguska blast over Siberia.

1000
01:21:23,885 --> 01:21:25,020
1945.

1001
01:21:26,355 --> 01:21:27,557
What didn't happen?

1002
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:30,827
1984.

1003
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:32,695
Ghosts attack New York City.

1004
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:34,429
The Manhattan Crossrip.

1005
01:21:42,371 --> 01:21:45,440
- It's a countdown.
- Like a prophecy?

1006
01:21:45,575 --> 01:21:46,875
Do you guys hear that?

1007
01:21:58,488 --> 01:21:59,589
Yeah, I do.

1008
01:22:06,895 --> 01:22:09,197
I think it's coming
from the death pit.

1009
01:22:29,084 --> 01:22:30,018
Phoebe.

1010
01:22:45,668 --> 01:22:46,569
Phoebe!

1011
01:22:52,107 --> 01:22:53,208
The earthquakes.

1012
01:22:56,945 --> 01:22:59,649
- Oh, my gosh!
- Phoebe!

1013
01:22:59,782 --> 01:23:01,884
Phoebe.

1014
01:23:06,354 --> 01:23:09,458
Phoebe.

1015
01:23:30,913 --> 01:23:32,548
I think he's alive.

1016
01:23:32,682 --> 01:23:35,618
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1017
01:23:35,751 --> 01:23:37,018
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1018
01:23:41,858 --> 01:23:43,626
Pheebs, what's wrong?

1019
01:23:43,759 --> 01:23:45,160
He was right all along.

1020
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:49,364
- What do you mean?
- Our grandfather.

1021
01:23:49,499 --> 01:23:52,067
He was right here.
He built this.

1022
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,737
He was standing guard,
even when no one believed him.

1023
01:23:56,973 --> 01:23:59,140
He sacrificed everything.

1024
01:23:59,274 --> 01:24:00,743
His life.

1025
01:24:01,978 --> 01:24:03,178
His friends.

1026
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:07,415
Us.

1027
01:24:12,387 --> 01:24:13,355
Bummer.

1028
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:16,826
Dude.

1029
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:21,196
We need to tell Mom.

1030
01:24:21,329 --> 01:24:22,430
Phoebe?

1031
01:24:24,432 --> 01:24:25,333
Pheebs?

1032
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:01,524
Mom?

1033
01:27:06,829 --> 01:27:07,730
Mom?

1034
01:27:10,365 --> 01:27:13,803
There is no Mom.
There is only Zuul.

1035
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:21,177
Mom, are you okay?

1036
01:27:25,514 --> 01:27:30,285
There is no Mom.
There is only Zuul.

1037
01:27:33,556 --> 01:27:34,857
What's happening right now?

1038
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:38,393
Mom?

1039
01:27:38,527 --> 01:27:39,695
Is she okay?

1040
01:27:39,829 --> 01:27:40,696
Mom?

1041
01:27:53,341 --> 01:27:55,410
Are you the Keymaster?

1042
01:27:55,544 --> 01:27:57,980
- Um, I don't know.
- Mom!

1043
01:27:58,114 --> 01:27:59,380
- What do I do?
- Mom, stop!

1044
01:27:59,515 --> 01:28:00,883
Whoa!

1045
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,111
Mom!

1046
01:29:06,248 --> 01:29:08,684
What the hell is going on?

1047
01:29:35,277 --> 01:29:36,478
What is all this?

1048
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:39,248
This isn't a farm.

1049
01:29:41,851 --> 01:29:43,252
It's a trap.

1050
01:30:12,915 --> 01:30:13,849
What?

1051
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:15,851
Nothing.

1052
01:30:18,187 --> 01:30:20,522
This is what he's been working
on all those years.

1053
01:30:20,656 --> 01:30:22,524
- Building this model?
- The detail is amazing.

1054
01:30:22,658 --> 01:30:23,926
No, he came here to finish

1055
01:30:24,059 --> 01:30:25,861
what the original
Ghostbusters started.

1056
01:30:25,995 --> 01:30:27,796
- To trap Gozer...
- Out in that dirt field.

1057
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:30,532
Exactly. These big silos act
as a capacitor.

1058
01:30:32,334 --> 01:30:34,435
- What's a capacitor?
- Would it kill you to read?

1059
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:36,071
Would it kill you
to just tell me?

1060
01:30:36,205 --> 01:30:37,438
Once activated,
these towers

1061
01:30:37,573 --> 01:30:39,208
can hold a charge
for one moment.

1062
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:41,610
But in that one moment, they
can power hundreds of traps.

1063
01:30:41,744 --> 01:30:44,013
So how do we get Gozer
into the field?

1064
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:45,881
Gozer's protected
by two evil spirits.

1065
01:30:46,015 --> 01:30:47,415
The Keymaster
and the Gatekeeper.

1066
01:30:47,549 --> 01:30:50,686
She needs both of them.
No Gatekeeper, no Gozer.

1067
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:53,589
First these spirits must
possess two human souls.

1068
01:30:53,722 --> 01:30:56,058
- Like Mom.
- So they can unite...

1069
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:58,527
formally.

1070
01:31:00,529 --> 01:31:01,730
What are we talking about?

1071
01:31:01,864 --> 01:31:03,933
We're thinking
at least third base.

1072
01:31:04,066 --> 01:31:04,967
Go, Mom.

1073
01:31:28,023 --> 01:31:29,558
I like your eyes.

1074
01:31:32,294 --> 01:31:33,329
Thanks.

1075
01:31:55,017 --> 01:31:56,185
They were just here.

1076
01:31:58,921 --> 01:31:59,822
There she is.

1077
01:32:04,626 --> 01:32:07,963
- Got anything?
- No, just more stupid guns.

1078
01:32:10,332 --> 01:32:13,569
A jail inside a jail.

1079
01:32:13,702 --> 01:32:15,237
What are you talking about?

1080
01:32:16,338 --> 01:32:17,806
No, no, no!

1081
01:32:20,175 --> 01:32:23,245
It's an ANSI Class One
electromagnetic deadbolt.

1082
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,547
I believe in you.

1083
01:32:27,182 --> 01:32:28,183
It's unpickable.

1084
01:32:40,796 --> 01:32:43,799
- What are you doing?
- I have a plan.

1085
01:32:45,968 --> 01:32:46,869
Wait!

1086
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:12,594
Come on. Let's go.

1087
01:33:12,728 --> 01:33:13,729
Okay.

1088
01:33:18,901 --> 01:33:20,269
- Ready?
- I'll be waiting.

1089
01:34:06,815 --> 01:34:08,317
That's my mom.

1090
01:34:27,102 --> 01:34:28,137
What?

1091
01:35:01,604 --> 01:35:02,704
Your Eminence.

1092
01:35:04,072 --> 01:35:06,175
Goddess of Gods.

1093
01:35:06,308 --> 01:35:09,711
I have built this temple
for you,

1094
01:35:09,845 --> 01:35:11,648
so that you might return
to Earth...

1095
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:14,716
<i>and together...</i>

1096
01:35:17,152 --> 01:35:18,153
<i>we...</i>

1097
01:35:19,788 --> 01:35:21,156
We can rule the world.

1098
01:35:51,186 --> 01:35:52,254
Excuse me.

1099
01:35:53,556 --> 01:35:54,790
Uh...

1100
01:35:54,923 --> 01:35:56,693
P-pardon me.

1101
01:35:56,825 --> 01:35:58,293
Yeah, hi.

1102
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:00,729
Uh...

1103
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,200
Uh...

1104
01:36:07,436 --> 01:36:10,105
What do you call a fish
with no eyes?

1105
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:17,246
A fsh...

1106
01:36:19,848 --> 01:36:21,083
Uh...

1107
01:36:22,184 --> 01:36:23,752
A whale...

1108
01:36:23,885 --> 01:36:26,054
There's two whales in a bar.
One of them goes:

1109
01:36:30,959 --> 01:36:32,928
And then the other one goes:

1110
01:36:33,061 --> 01:36:34,631
"Go home. You're drunk."

1111
01:36:37,432 --> 01:36:39,001
Uh...

1112
01:36:42,037 --> 01:36:43,772
- Okay.
- Uh...

1113
01:36:43,905 --> 01:36:46,676
So a grasshopper
walks into a bar...

1114
01:36:47,809 --> 01:36:49,444
and the bartender's like:

1115
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:51,980
"We have a drink
named after you."

1116
01:36:52,114 --> 01:36:53,448
Then the grasshopper's like:

1117
01:36:54,617 --> 01:36:57,654
"You have a drink named Steve?"

1118
01:37:01,423 --> 01:37:05,894
Have you come
to offer yourself in sacrifice?

1119
01:37:06,028 --> 01:37:07,329
What?

1120
01:37:08,797 --> 01:37:11,734
Are you prepared to die?

1121
01:37:13,268 --> 01:37:14,970
No, I'm 12.

1122
01:37:18,373 --> 01:37:19,509
Are you?

1123
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:31,788
Mom!

1124
01:37:53,008 --> 01:37:55,410
- Wait, wait. What's going on?
- Hey!

1125
01:37:55,545 --> 01:37:57,312
- What's happening? Where am I?
- It's okay.

1126
01:37:57,446 --> 01:37:58,748
- You were possessed.
- Possessed?

1127
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,584
- Then you turned into a dog.
- Then you got humpy.

1128
01:38:01,718 --> 01:38:02,752
- Humpy?
- Hold on!

1129
01:38:16,632 --> 01:38:20,268
Oh, Phoebe. Phoebe.
There's this secret basement...

1130
01:38:20,402 --> 01:38:22,739
- We know.
- ...with computers and equipment.

1131
01:38:22,871 --> 01:38:24,272
- Isn't that place insane?
- Yes!

1132
01:38:24,406 --> 01:38:27,242
And it seemed
like he had a plan.

1133
01:38:27,376 --> 01:38:28,745
- We're aware.
- Oh. Oh.

1134
01:38:28,877 --> 01:38:31,246
And there were
all these photos of me.

1135
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,583
Like he was tracking
my entire life.

1136
01:38:33,716 --> 01:38:35,050
- How rewarding.
- Super news.

1137
01:38:35,183 --> 01:38:36,385
We wanna hear about it.

1138
01:38:36,519 --> 01:38:38,621
Yeah, but we're trying
to save the world.

1139
01:38:38,755 --> 01:38:41,123
Okay. Cool. I'm in.
Uh, how can I help?

1140
01:38:41,256 --> 01:38:43,358
- No!
- What the hell was that?

1141
01:38:43,493 --> 01:38:45,961
- That was your boyfriend Gary.
- Boyfriend?

1142
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,638
Inside that trap
is the Gatekeeper.

1143
01:38:55,772 --> 01:38:57,072
- Gatekeeper?
- If the Gatekeeper

1144
01:38:57,205 --> 01:38:58,106
and the Keymaster reunite...

1145
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,375
- Keymaster?
- One second.

1146
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:11,186
Phoebe.

1147
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:13,355
You're... You're...

1148
01:39:15,323 --> 01:39:16,458
I'm a scientist.

1149
01:39:19,928 --> 01:39:22,097
- Oh. We got her!
- Yes!

1150
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:23,566
This was Grandpa's plan.

1151
01:39:25,333 --> 01:39:26,468
Coming in hot!

1152
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,391
Mom, come on!

1153
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:50,560
Oh, my God.

1154
01:40:03,673 --> 01:40:05,207
- Get back. Get back.
- Mom.

1155
01:40:08,644 --> 01:40:10,011
- What's up?
- Hey.

1156
01:40:14,784 --> 01:40:15,718
No, no, no.

1157
01:40:51,954 --> 01:40:52,822
Pull the lever.

1158
01:40:52,955 --> 01:40:53,856
Pull...?

1159
01:41:05,635 --> 01:41:06,536
Aah!

1160
01:41:07,269 --> 01:41:08,203
Hey!

1161
01:41:19,682 --> 01:41:21,484
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1162
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:22,985
I'm waiting
for this thing to work!

1163
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:24,419
- It's not working!
- Uh...

1164
01:41:40,402 --> 01:41:42,203
- Mom, hit the pedal!
- Pedal?

1165
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:00,590
Lucky!

1166
01:42:00,723 --> 01:42:02,024
Podcast,
what are you doing?

1167
01:42:02,157 --> 01:42:03,559
I've got my own problems!

1168
01:42:53,476 --> 01:42:54,510
Oh, no.

1169
01:42:56,244 --> 01:42:57,145
No.

1170
01:43:02,118 --> 01:43:03,385
Hey, flattop.

1171
01:43:06,756 --> 01:43:07,923
Have you missed us?

1172
01:43:12,427 --> 01:43:14,530
Gozer the Gozerian...

1173
01:43:14,664 --> 01:43:17,399
...in the name of the county of
Summerville, state of Oklahoma,

1174
01:43:17,533 --> 01:43:19,135
the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service,

1175
01:43:19,267 --> 01:43:21,269
all the members
of Ducks Unlimited,

1176
01:43:21,403 --> 01:43:23,973
the Association for the
Advancement of Retired Persons,

1177
01:43:24,106 --> 01:43:27,375
I command you under the National
Invasive Species Act

1178
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:30,713
to depart this world
immediately.

1179
01:43:30,846 --> 01:43:31,781
Bravo.

1180
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,318
I think she remembers us.

1181
01:43:40,623 --> 01:43:42,390
Are you...

1182
01:43:42,525 --> 01:43:44,026
a god?

1183
01:43:47,295 --> 01:43:49,065
- Ray?
- Oh, come on, Ray.

1184
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:51,801
Yes.

1185
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:53,903
Yeah, we're all gods.

1186
01:43:54,036 --> 01:43:56,572
Yeah, I mean, we're all pretty
dang special down here.

1187
01:43:56,706 --> 01:43:57,973
On a personal note:

1188
01:43:58,107 --> 01:44:00,543
I thought that we had busted up
for good.

1189
01:44:00,676 --> 01:44:02,144
It wasn't working for me.

1190
01:44:02,277 --> 01:44:05,346
My friends didn't think so.
I know yours didn't.

1191
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:07,717
Okay, playtime's over.
Let's toast this muffin.

1192
01:44:10,853 --> 01:44:12,220
Light them up.

1193
01:44:13,889 --> 01:44:15,858
Man, I love that sound.

1194
01:44:17,927 --> 01:44:19,227
On the count of three.

1195
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,864
Go on "two." One. Two.

1196
01:44:24,767 --> 01:44:27,402
Yeah, nothing stings
like a billion electron volts!

1197
01:44:37,345 --> 01:44:38,481
Yes!

1198
01:44:40,182 --> 01:44:41,150
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.

1199
01:44:41,282 --> 01:44:42,218
Uh-oh.

1200
01:44:46,421 --> 01:44:48,256
She's uncrossing
the streams!

1201
01:44:53,696 --> 01:44:54,797
- No!
- Oh!

1202
01:44:56,932 --> 01:44:57,800
Are they dead?

1203
01:45:01,604 --> 01:45:03,973
I don't remember
this job being so painful.

1204
01:45:05,273 --> 01:45:07,843
- I do.
- You got a lot of nerve.

1205
01:45:09,879 --> 01:45:13,381
Coming back here,
crawling back to me.

1206
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:16,819
We could've been the most
spectacular power couple.

1207
01:45:16,952 --> 01:45:21,257
You know, my sense of fun
and your personality.

1208
01:45:21,389 --> 01:45:24,325
But, no, you always had
to vanquish and conquer.

1209
01:45:24,459 --> 01:45:25,995
Always had to maim somebody.

1210
01:45:26,128 --> 01:45:29,632
And that's probably
the number one reason why...

1211
01:45:29,765 --> 01:45:31,233
Good try, anyway.

1212
01:45:31,366 --> 01:45:33,468
Now we're finished, babe.

1213
01:45:33,602 --> 01:45:34,737
We're finished.

1214
01:45:43,546 --> 01:45:44,445
No.

1215
01:45:56,826 --> 01:45:58,194
Come on, Phoebe.

1216
01:46:24,954 --> 01:46:25,855
Holy shit.

1217
01:47:09,565 --> 01:47:10,532
We're on!

1218
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,263
I thought
you might turn up.

1219
01:48:20,069 --> 01:48:20,970
I'm sorry...

1220
01:48:22,104 --> 01:48:23,639
I didn't believe you.

1221
01:48:25,908 --> 01:48:26,976
I should've called.

1222
01:48:28,243 --> 01:48:29,478
I miss you, my friend.

1223
01:48:35,751 --> 01:48:37,119
Are you okay?

1224
01:48:37,252 --> 01:48:39,121
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Mom.

1225
01:48:39,254 --> 01:48:40,522
I can't breathe.

1226
01:48:40,656 --> 01:48:41,657
Okay.

1227
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:44,827
Hi there.

1228
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,662
Pete Venkman
from the home office.

1229
01:48:46,795 --> 01:48:49,131
- Thanks for pitching in.
- You're welcome.

1230
01:48:49,264 --> 01:48:50,566
I like your style.

1231
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:52,201
Who's that one?

1232
01:48:52,334 --> 01:48:53,235
Callie.

1233
01:48:55,504 --> 01:48:56,872
Callie Spengler.

1234
01:48:57,006 --> 01:48:58,507
- Spengler?
- Mm.

1235
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,543
Weird name.
Try to make the best of that.

1236
01:49:01,677 --> 01:49:04,046
All right.
We're gonna have cocoa inside.

1237
01:49:04,179 --> 01:49:06,348
And some of us
will have rum with it.

1238
01:49:07,683 --> 01:49:08,650
Lucky!

1239
01:49:13,889 --> 01:49:17,159
- Oh.
- God. Hey. Hey, man.

1240
01:49:17,292 --> 01:49:20,662
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I... Yeah.

1241
01:49:20,796 --> 01:49:22,464
My hands hurt
from galloping.

1242
01:49:30,272 --> 01:49:31,907
Oh, my God.

1243
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:33,510
I totally thought I lost you.

1244
01:49:33,642 --> 01:49:35,144
Sorry about that.

1245
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:37,179
Well, that was weird.

1246
01:49:37,312 --> 01:49:38,547
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1247
01:49:39,815 --> 01:49:41,016
I'm bleeding.
Why am I bleeding?

1248
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:42,418
You headbutted a park bench.

1249
01:49:42,551 --> 01:49:44,186
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1250
01:49:46,822 --> 01:49:48,323
- Hi.
- Hi.

1251
01:49:49,492 --> 01:49:52,261
- Um, back there, yeah.
- Yeah.

1252
01:49:52,394 --> 01:49:54,063
I mean, before we became dogs

1253
01:49:54,196 --> 01:49:58,033
and opened the gates of hell,
I think that maybe we, uh...

1254
01:49:58,167 --> 01:50:00,235
Yeah. Yeah, I think so too.

1255
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:03,272
But then we saved the world,
so...

1256
01:50:03,405 --> 01:50:04,773
That's true.

1257
01:50:08,977 --> 01:50:11,346
Are you all right, son?

1258
01:50:11,481 --> 01:50:15,050
You just singlehandedly defeated
a manifestation of Gozer.

1259
01:50:15,184 --> 01:50:17,052
You gotta be on my podcast.

1260
01:50:17,186 --> 01:50:18,521

1261
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:20,422

Don't worry.

It's a souvenir
from the World's Fair

1360
02:01:58,854 --> 02:02:02,323
at Flushing Meadow
in 1964.

1361
02:02:02,457 --> 02:02:04,126
It's my lucky coin.

1362
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:07,462
I shouldn't take it.
We might not be coming back.

1363
02:02:07,596 --> 02:02:10,666
Take it anyway.
I got another one at home.

1364
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,474
<i>Egon was the brains.</i>

1365
02:02:19,608 --> 02:02:20,810
<i>Ray was the heart.</i>

1366
02:02:22,211 --> 02:02:23,411
<i>Peter just kept it cool.</i>

1367
02:02:25,114 --> 02:02:26,749
Who were you?

1368
02:02:26,882 --> 02:02:27,917
The sex appeal.

1369
02:02:31,887 --> 02:02:34,290
You've done very well
for yourself.

1370
02:02:34,422 --> 02:02:36,759
A lot of shelf space.

1371
02:02:36,892 --> 02:02:39,161
See, that's the thing.

1372
02:02:39,295 --> 02:02:40,996
<i>I don't do it for me.</i>

1373
02:02:42,097 --> 02:02:43,499
<i>I do it for my kids,</i>

1374
02:02:43,632 --> 02:02:46,836
and I wanna be an example
of what's possible.

1375
02:02:46,969 --> 02:02:49,972
You still covering the rent
at Ray's bookshop?

1376
02:02:50,105 --> 02:02:53,642
Ray's gonna turn
a profit one of these days.

1377
02:02:53,776 --> 02:02:57,079
<i>I
remember the day you came in.</i>

1378
02:02:57,213 --> 02:03:00,082
<i>I came in looking
for a steady paycheck.</i>

1379
02:03:00,216 --> 02:03:02,551
<i>But busting ghosts
with the guys...</i>

1380
02:03:02,685 --> 02:03:04,653
taught me not to be afraid.

1381
02:03:04,787 --> 02:03:07,422
That I had the tools
and I had the talent.

1382
02:03:07,556 --> 02:03:11,160
I started this business
with one employee.

1383
02:03:11,293 --> 02:03:14,395
And I've grown it into
a thriving global enterprise.

1384
02:03:15,463 --> 02:03:17,666
I may be a businessman,

1385
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:20,870
but I will always be
a Ghostbuster.
