1
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:15,502
Step right up.

2
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:17,504
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:19,589
and come with us to yesteryear.

4
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:22,467
Witness the Wild West as it really was.

5
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:24,886
The greatest show on Earth.

6
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:28,432
Fun and educational for you, young sir.

7
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:33,228
Step right up to another time

8
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:35,731
of mighty beasts
and hard-hearted outlaws.

9
00:02:56,478 --> 00:02:58,146
Kemosabe?

10
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,651
Who? Me?

11
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,158
You bring horses?

12
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:13,286
I think you made a mistake, mister.

13
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,793
Mistake?

14
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,473
Make trade.

15
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,370
Trade.

16
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,813
Who did you think I was, anyway?

17
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:29,112
Never take off mask.

18
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,409
Why not?

19
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,675
You sure about this?

20
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,093
Mmm.

21
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:55,680
Dead man strike fear
into heart of his enemy.

22
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,603
All right.

23
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,730
Let's do this.

24
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:14,866
Easy!

25
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:22,541
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,126
my colleague and I
will be making a withdrawal.

27
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,087
I understand this bank is insured, so...

28
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:31,299
...nobody move.

29
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,428
What's with the mask?

30
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:38,848
See? I told you. I feel ridiculous.

31
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,984
I guess I didn't make myself clear!

32
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,485
This is a damn bank robbery!

33
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:54,281
Wait a minute.

34
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,408
You're saying you're Tonto?

35
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:57,492
The Tonto?

36
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,829
There is another?

37
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:03,999
But the Lone Ranger
and Tonto were good guys.

38
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:06,126
I mean, they didn't rob banks.

39
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:11,006
Did they?

40
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,176
Come a time, kemosabe...

41
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,977
...when good man must wear mask.

42
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,490
Run that next rail!

43
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,203
More rocks! They need
more rocks right there!

44
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,876
Rail down!

45
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,716
Shake a leg, chums!

46
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,362
My friends and citizens of Colby,

47
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,490
I've asked you here today
so you can see at firsthand

48
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,367
what I believe to be the single most

49
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,078
important enterprise under God.

50
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:26,873
The unification of
this great country of ours

51
00:07:27,374 --> 00:07:28,958
by iron rail.

52
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,752
Hear, hear!

53
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:37,676
To the Comanche,

54
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,136
I say you have nothing to fear.

55
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:42,430
As long as there is peace between us

56
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,808
all land treaties shall be honoured.

57
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,396
But to the outlaw,
those who prey upon the weak,

58
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:52,649
make no mistake, law and order

59
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,026
has come to the Wild West.

60
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:57,362
Which is why I am bringing

61
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:00,615
notorious outlaw and Indian-killer,

62
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,911
Butch Cavendish here
to Colby to hang for his crimes.

63
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:10,083
The future is bright,
ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,711
and it's just around the bend.

65
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,188
Ride 'em out! Come on!

66
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,860
Whoa, girl!

67
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:56,129
Run a man all the way to state line,

68
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:58,089
put him on a train
and ship him right back.

69
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,049
Don't make no sense.

70
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,886
Guess they run out of
hanging rope in Oklahoma.

71
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:05,555
Mr Cole wants to make an example.

72
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:08,892
Word is, Cavendish is
looking for payback with you, Dan.

73
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,310
Reckon so.

74
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:12,979
They say Butch Cavendish
ate a Red-Legger's heart

75
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,689
in the Missouri wars.

76
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,357
Swallowed it whole.

77
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,359
I heard it was the eyes.

78
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,237
Man told me he ate part of his own foot

79
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,239
just to win a bet.

80
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:25,825
Hell, he did.

81
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:27,327
MARTINI Which is it, Dan?

82
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,370
Don't see how it makes a difference.

83
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,080
What's the matter with him?

84
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,002
It's not Cavendish he's worried about.

85
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:04,531
Like Daniel
entering the lion's den,

86
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,199
we shall stare down the beast.

87
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:07,325
Amen!

88
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,577
And purge
this Godless land

89
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:12,330
of the poisons of sin and licentiousness.

90
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,832
Hallelujah!

91
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:17,168
Dear God, grant us
thy mercy and wise judgment.

92
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:18,670
- Amen!
- Amen.

93
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:21,297
Thy equanimity
and singleness of purpose,

94
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,467
so we might prove
thy stalwart and worthy servants

95
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,053
in our war against sin. Amen!

96
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:28,555
Amen.

97
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:29,889
Catch.

98
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,110
Baby, baby, baby.

99
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,071
Care to pray with us?

100
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,031
We're Presbyterian.

101
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:51,578
I'm much obliged, ma'am,
but this, here, is my bible.

102
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:58,334
Shall we gather at the river

103
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:03,131
Where bright angel feet have trod

104
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:07,343
With its crystal tide forever...

105
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,195
It's almost hanging time, Butch.

106
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,824
Do you hear what I said, boy?

107
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,669
I'm gonna enjoy watching them
wipe that look off your face.

108
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:49,177
It's broke, lnjun. Can't you see that?

109
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,073
Very pretty.

110
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:16,871
For you.

111
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:19,248
Oh. No, I couldn't.

112
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,042
For you!

113
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,173
She's right.

114
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,217
It matches your eyes.

115
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,431
I didn't think
you'd make it out, Mrs Reid.

116
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,975
Well, I just wanted
to see what all the fuss was about.

117
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,937
And, um,
what do you think of our endeavour?

118
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,399
Looks to me like
just a lot of men digging in the desert.

119
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,027
Danny, one day soon,

120
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,238
you'll be able
to get on a train right here in Colby,

121
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,073
travel all the way to San Francisco

122
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:53,992
eating New York oysters packed in ice.

123
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,160
Then you can sail to China.

124
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,663
Come back around
the other way if you want.

125
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:00,415
That true, Mama?

126
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,458
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

127
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,377
Here, let me show you.

128
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,921
You see that?

129
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:08,923
Now you try.

130
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:13,928
Oh, I expect on a lawman's salary,
quite a lot falls on you.

131
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,641
We do just fine.

132
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,809
Thank you.

133
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,687
Oh, I mean no disrespect.

134
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,273
They don't make men
like your husband any more.

135
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,525
In fact, I envy him.

136
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:28,985
A fine family.

137
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:31,863
A son to carry on his name.

138
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:36,784
I just hate to see a bird in a cage.

139
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,172
Well...

140
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:52,049
That is right about on time.

141
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,507
Shh!

142
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,556
Piss break, boss.

143
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:48,040
Grace our spirits will deliver

144
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:52,169
And provide a robe and crown...

145
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,493
Afternoon, ladies.

146
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,871
There's no need for violence, my son.

147
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,601
Fifteen hours,
I watched you feed that bird.

148
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,521
Gets on a man's nerves.

149
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,778
I do not fear what comes next.

150
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,864
Nothing comes next.

151
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,371
Nice suit.

152
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:16,837
Time has finally come, Windigo.

153
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,053
Do I know you, lnjun?

154
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:25,805
You know me.

155
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,392
You know me by the screams

156
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:31,477
of my ancestors in the desert wind.

157
00:17:32,353 --> 00:17:34,897
As you will know their cries of joy

158
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:38,859
when I remove your evil seed
from the face of Earth.

159
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,531
That won't be necessary.

160
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:44,615
As District Attorney,

161
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll see to it that this man is prosecuted

162
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:47,952
to the full extent of the law.

163
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,962
What kind of a lawman
don't carry his own gun?

164
00:17:58,212 --> 00:17:59,797
Believe me, where this train's headed,

165
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,299
there's no place for men who do.

166
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,342
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

167
00:18:05,636 --> 00:18:06,887
The future.

168
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,100
Know something,
Counsellor?

169
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:13,269
Maybe you're right.

170
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:16,480
A lawyer and a crazy lnjun.

171
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:19,066
Bet you two got a lot to talk about.

172
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,320
Best make it quick.

173
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:40,171
Shall we gather at the river

174
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:41,505
...the river

175
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,966
I can't get it off.

176
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,760
No...

177
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:47,553
Play on, boys.

178
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:52,058
Sing it to me!

179
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,772
Should be slowing down by now.

180
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:08,616
Anyway, I'm sure we'll be
at the station any minute.

181
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,582
Get the horses! Come on!

182
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:21,921
Jesus, we ought to go.

183
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:37,728
That's reinforced Bethlehem steel.

184
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:40,147
Any attempts at escape is futile.

185
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:52,034
That's great!

186
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:53,869
Good job.

187
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,914
And for coming to the aid
of a federal prosecutor,

188
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:59,333
I can be sure to put in
a good word with the judge.

189
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,815
Come on, boys!
Put your backs into it.

190
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:25,359
The rail road waits for no man!

191
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,697
That's the end of the line.

192
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,157
We jump.

193
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,117
What about the passengers?

194
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,243
They jump.

195
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:37,621
There are children on board.

196
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,914
All jump.

197
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,001
Have you no decency?

198
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:43,294
Windigo getting away!

199
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,337
No, you're not going anywhere.

200
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:05,107
Going somewhere?

201
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,067
- Yes.
- No.

202
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:08,986
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

203
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,654
- No, we are not. No.
- Yes. Yes.

204
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,406
Shut up!

205
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,201
Yes.

206
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:28,297
Ugh.

207
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:51,904
Thank you.

208
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,033
Do-si-doe.

209
00:21:57,618 --> 00:21:59,036
Why don't you put that thing down,

210
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,913
and we'll settle this like men?

211
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:02,748
Although, I warn you.

212
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:05,084
I boxed in law school.

213
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:13,384
Huh?

214
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:27,815
Great warrior.

215
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:29,900
Yeah, that's my brother.

216
00:22:40,077 --> 00:22:41,245
Nice suit.

217
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,247
We have to stop the train.

218
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,331
No time!

219
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:45,499
Must to jump!

220
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,294
I'm not leaving
these passengers!

221
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:50,504
Then help me unhook the cars!

222
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,760
Come On!

223
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:01,348
It's jammed! Give me a hand.

224
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,059
You hold.

225
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:06,186
Whoa!

226
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,407
John.

227
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,568
What the...

228
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:58,298
Ugh.

229
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:08,767
Hey, hold it right there.

230
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:14,273
I'm afraid I have to take you in.

231
00:25:19,903 --> 00:25:21,572
Do you hear me?

232
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:23,323
You speak English, don't you?

233
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,246
Halt!

234
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:33,459
By the authority granted to me

235
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,586
by the state of Texas,

236
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:38,464
I'm hereby arresting you.

237
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,595
You all right there, little brother?

238
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:45,763
Fine.

239
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,389
Just taking this man into custody.

240
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:49,391
Uh-huh.

241
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:55,939
He was on that train for a reason, Dan.

242
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,691
Probably.

243
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,234
What's your crime, boy?

244
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,446
Indian.

245
00:26:03,906 --> 00:26:06,241
And a man, in the eyes of the law.

246
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:07,409
Now, throw me your cuffs.

247
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,372
Whatever you say, little brother.

248
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:15,959
it's nothing personal.

249
00:26:23,258 --> 00:26:24,259
Dan?

250
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:28,972
John.

251
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:32,142
They said there was an accident

252
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:34,144
and someone fell off the train.

253
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:36,730
Actually, it was me.

254
00:26:37,648 --> 00:26:38,774
Dan's fine.

255
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:42,236
Saved the day. Same as usual.

256
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:44,613
Oh, my God, your face.

257
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,156
Um...

258
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:49,743
Come here.

259
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,168
God, it's good to see you.

260
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:00,921
What's it been, nine years?

261
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,590
Eight, since you stopped writing.

262
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,636
We were just kids back then.

263
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,268
Well, he takes good care of you, I see.

264
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:19,439
Yeah. In his way.

265
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,360
He spends most his time

266
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:25,696
in Indian territory these days.

267
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,698
Indian territory?

268
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,867
Doesn't sound like Dan.

269
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,368
Doing what?

270
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:32,703
Well, whatever it is,

271
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,454
he doesn't talk to me about it.

272
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:37,249
So...

273
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,084
Have you got a place to stay?

274
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,210
I...

275
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:41,753
No. Not as yet.

276
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:44,214
Well, you should stay
with us at Willow Creek.

277
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,761
I don't know.

278
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,974
Oh, God, look at you.

279
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,976
City boy.

280
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,814
Why would you ever want
to come back here?

281
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,651
It's my home.

282
00:28:11,992 --> 00:28:13,035
Who are you?

283
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,538
Danny, this is your Uncle John.

284
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,334
Why, you look
just like your dad did

285
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,585
when he was your age.

286
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,295
They're going out again.

287
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:04,586
He deserves a trial, Dan.

288
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,673
Two Rangers are dead.
Didn't get no trial.

289
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,758
Well, I'm coming with you.

290
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:12,010
The law looks a lot different
on the ground, little brother.

291
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,887
Well, it doesn't include vengeance,

292
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,138
no matter where you're standing.

293
00:29:15,222 --> 00:29:16,807
For "Wherever men unite into society,

294
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,517
"they must quit the laws
of nature and assume..."

295
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,644
"And assume the laws of men,

296
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,772
"so that society as a whole
may prosper."

297
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:27,401
That's John Locke's
Treatises of Government.

298
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:30,070
Never thought to hear
the likes of it in Colby.

299
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:32,406
Mr Cole, my brother John.

300
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:33,782
New county prosecutor.

301
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:37,494
Latham Cole? It's an honour, sir.

302
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:39,079
I read about you during the war.

303
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:41,581
John, here,
is an educated man like yourself.

304
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,667
Well, let's try not to
hold that against him.

305
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:46,211
You going after Cavendish?

306
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:48,380
Collins, here, picked up a trail.

307
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:50,716
- Used to track for our father.
- Can he ride?

308
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:55,887
Well enough.

309
00:29:56,179 --> 00:29:58,140
Yeah, well, you see to it.

310
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:00,183
Railroad promised
these people a hanging.

311
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,351
I didn't know the rail road

312
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,103
was in the business
of keeping promises.

313
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:04,771
A simple task.

314
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:07,774
Collect the prisoner,
deliver him to his execution.

315
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,193
If you're not up to that, Mr Reid,

316
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:12,904
I'll find someone who is.

317
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,248
Maybe you should think
about staying in town for a few days.

318
00:30:23,915 --> 00:30:25,333
Comanche are restless.

319
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,626
They're always restless,

320
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,086
but they keep to their side of the river,

321
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,755
and I keep to mine.

322
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,299
Besides, fences won't
put themselves up.

323
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,634
It's my job.

324
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,928
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

325
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:38,638
I am happy.

326
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:41,641
I'm happy with the life
you provide. I just...

327
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,398
Is that new?

328
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:54,654
Matches your eyes.

329
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,076
All right.

330
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:02,287
Now, I expect you
to be bagging squirrels

331
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,497
by the time I get back.

332
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:26,019
Like old times, huh?

333
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:30,273
Thank you.

334
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,365
All right, Mr Prosecutor.

335
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:41,993
Let's see how your due process
fares on the trail.

336
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,004
It's Dad's.

337
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:57,217
I hereby deputise you a Texas Ranger.

338
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,223
But I can't help you with them clothes.

339
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:53,273
Indians call that your spirit horse.

340
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:57,027
Come to take you to the other side.

341
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:59,779
You can't scare me
with your ghost stories any more, Dan.

342
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:04,034
Since when did you start
wearing Indian jewellery, anyway?

343
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:05,702
Since my kid brother became a lawyer.

344
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:06,786
Yeah?

345
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,915
World needs lawyers
same as it does Rangers.

346
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:12,626
I reckon so. It's a nice hat, by the way.

347
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,502
They didn't have a bigger one?

348
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,173
He missed you.

349
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:19,633
Could have fooled me.

350
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,893
You smell like a distillery already.

351
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,186
Steadies the hand.

352
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,106
You even sleep last night?

353
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,274
You know me, Johnny.

354
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:40,278
Never been one
to resist a little Western hospitality.

355
00:33:43,698 --> 00:33:45,408
"Red's." Hmm.

356
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:47,118
What's this? Like, dancing?

357
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:49,412
Yeah.

358
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,498
Dancing.

359
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,686
Could go by the flats.

360
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,730
Lose a day. Maybe a day and a half.

361
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:18,108
What is it?

362
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:19,693
No cover.

363
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,321
What do you figure, Dan?

364
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:26,199
Figure Collins should go take a look.

365
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,576
If he can stay in the saddle.

366
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,335
John. Come here.

367
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:46,177
No, I don't believe in them.
You know that.

368
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:50,557
Butch Cavendish don't care
one way or the other.

369
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:55,020
I'll take my chances.

370
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:00,316
You stay close.

371
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,401
Come on.

372
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,497
Where the hell's Collins?

373
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:01,586
Ambush!

374
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:03,546
I can't see him!

375
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,006
I got no shot!

376
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:07,467
Ride! Ride!

377
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:46,172
Dan!

378
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,008
Ride! Ride out!

379
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:08,319
Your hand! John, give me your hand!

380
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:09,904
- No. No!

381
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,617
No, Dan! Dan!

382
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:16,536
No! No, no...

383
00:37:19,122 --> 00:37:20,915
You shouldn't have come back, John.

384
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:22,041
No, it's okay. It's okay.

385
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:23,585
I messed up.

386
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:27,130
No, no. You're okay, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

387
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:31,885
She always loved you.

388
00:37:35,513 --> 00:37:37,473
Take care of her for me.

389
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,518
No, you're coming with me.
Come on! Come on!

390
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:57,494
Come on!

391
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:40,119
It's been
a long time, Ranger.

392
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,790
You've looked better.

393
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:48,211
I heard them boys in Tulsa
took a real shine to you.

394
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:54,550
All heart, ain't you?

395
00:39:03,226 --> 00:39:06,145
A year you took from me
in that sweatbox.

396
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:14,654
You take something from me,

397
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:17,448
be damn sure

398
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:23,079
I'm gonna take something from you.

399
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,965
Oh, yes!

400
00:40:15,923 --> 00:40:18,051
Deal dies with you, old friend.

401
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:17,068
That's not right.

402
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:19,278
It can't be right.

403
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,157
They're dead? All dead?

404
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:24,659
Even Dan?

405
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:28,913
Dan very dead.

406
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,999
But he's the Lone Ranger.

407
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:35,837
Would have been much easier, I agree.

408
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:40,258
How did you get out of jail, anyway?

409
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:41,634
Hmm?

410
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:00,319
And would you stop feeding that bird?

411
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:01,821
It's not alive, you know.

412
00:42:06,784 --> 00:42:09,078
Awaiting spirit to return.

413
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:11,831
Not same thing.

414
00:43:13,518 --> 00:43:14,644
Hmm.

415
00:43:52,348 --> 00:43:55,142
Greetings, noble spirit horse.

416
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:05,111
No, no! No, no, please.
You make mistake.

417
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:09,574
Half-wit.

418
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,701
Wet brain.

419
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:13,452
You come.

420
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:14,704
Come, come.

421
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,126
Him

422
00:44:20,793 --> 00:44:22,545
great warrior.

423
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:27,466
Spirit horse

424
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:30,303
you have travelled far.

425
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:32,597
Obviously very fatigued.

426
00:44:32,805 --> 00:44:34,307
I understand.

427
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:37,018
You come. Come, come.

428
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,394
Come, come.

429
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:43,190
Him strong brother.

430
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:45,151
Want him, bring him back.

431
00:45:36,952 --> 00:45:38,079
John! Give me your hand!

432
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:51,342
Rebecca.

433
00:45:55,388 --> 00:45:56,389
John!

434
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,250
If you are going to
sneak up on an Indian,

435
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:50,503
best to do it downwind.

436
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:54,215
Why are you talking to that horse?

437
00:47:54,298 --> 00:47:57,468
My grandfather spoke
of a time when animals could speak.

438
00:47:58,094 --> 00:48:01,388
When you get them alone, some still do.

439
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:05,684
But I cannot decide
whether this horse is stupid,

440
00:48:06,727 --> 00:48:08,687
or pretending to be stupid.

441
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:11,565
Tricky.

442
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:14,527
Why am I covered in dirt?

443
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:17,655
Because I buried you.

444
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:22,701
Then why am I alive?

445
00:48:26,497 --> 00:48:29,208
Horse says you are Spirit Walker.

446
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,086
A man who has been to the other side,

447
00:48:32,169 --> 00:48:33,587
and returned.

448
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,005
A man

449
00:48:36,132 --> 00:48:38,551
who cannot be killed in battle.

450
00:48:43,514 --> 00:48:45,474
Horse definitely stupid.

451
00:48:48,144 --> 00:48:49,854
Are those my boots?

452
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:07,079
He cut out his heart.

453
00:49:08,622 --> 00:49:11,041
What kind of a man
does something like that?

454
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:13,460
Not a man.

455
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:16,088
An evil spirit

456
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:19,049
born in the empty spaces of the desert.

457
00:49:20,217 --> 00:49:21,886
With a hunger

458
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,598
that cannot be satisfied.

459
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,231
And the power
to throw nature out of balance.

460
00:49:38,694 --> 00:49:41,280
My people call this spirit "windigo."

461
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:44,617
I am Tonto of the Comanche,

462
00:49:45,117 --> 00:49:47,202
last of the windigo hunters.

463
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:49,538
So, what do you want with me?

464
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:52,166
A vision told me a great warrior

465
00:49:52,249 --> 00:49:55,002
and Spirit Walker
would help me on my quest.

466
00:49:56,462 --> 00:49:58,672
I would have preferred someone else.

467
00:49:58,756 --> 00:50:00,549
Your brother, perhaps.

468
00:50:01,383 --> 00:50:02,801
He would have been good.

469
00:50:03,802 --> 00:50:06,680
But who am I to question
the great father, hmm?

470
00:50:07,973 --> 00:50:10,476
All I know is a man killed my brother,

471
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:12,895
and I'll see him hang for it.

472
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:23,197
Then you will need this.

473
00:50:27,117 --> 00:50:28,118
A bullet?

474
00:50:28,577 --> 00:50:29,745
Mmm.

475
00:50:31,288 --> 00:50:32,414
A silver bullet?

476
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:34,416
Silver made him what he is.

477
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:37,753
And so it will return him to the earth.

478
00:50:40,965 --> 00:50:42,132
Right.

479
00:50:43,217 --> 00:50:44,301
You know what?

480
00:50:44,843 --> 00:50:47,221
I would like to thank you

481
00:50:47,304 --> 00:50:49,682
for everything that you've done for me.

482
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:53,894
But I should get back.

483
00:50:58,023 --> 00:51:01,068
I, too,
seek the windigo Butch Cavendish.

484
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:02,736
Good.

485
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,488
I was prisoner on the train

486
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:06,407
the way a coyote stalks buffalo.

487
00:51:06,782 --> 00:51:09,994
After hunting 26 years I had my prey

488
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:11,328
until you interfere.

489
00:51:14,456 --> 00:51:16,917
Actually, I think I saved your life.

490
00:51:18,544 --> 00:51:19,837
So, we're even.

491
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:22,589
Ow!

492
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:25,217
What the hell was that for?

493
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:28,262
Bird angry.

494
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,686
Yeah. You know what?

495
00:51:35,894 --> 00:51:37,521
I can't help you.

496
00:51:37,938 --> 00:51:39,273
Or your bird.

497
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,566
Where do you go?

498
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:42,943
Into town, to form a posse.

499
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:44,862
I would not do that, kemosabe.

500
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,071
Yeah?

501
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:49,324
There was a gun
waiting for Cavendish on the train.

502
00:51:51,243 --> 00:51:53,287
Eight men rode into canyon.

503
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,832
I dig seven graves.

504
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,921
Collins.

505
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:10,137
He's known us since we were kids.

506
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:13,223
You find traitor,

507
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:18,228
you find the man who killed your brother.

508
00:52:20,314 --> 00:52:22,358
That's my brother's vest.

509
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:30,199
Eyes, cut by the bullets that killed him.

510
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:32,951
From the great beyond,

511
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:35,120
he will protect you

512
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:37,915
and the ones you love.

513
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,919
You want me to wear a mask?

514
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:44,963
The men you seek
think you are dead, kemosabe.

515
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:49,051
Better to stay that way.

516
00:52:58,644 --> 00:53:01,188
All right, but if we ride together,

517
00:53:01,271 --> 00:53:03,816
it's to bring these men to justice
in a court of law.

518
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:06,110
Is that understood?

519
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:25,796
Justice

520
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,590
is what I seek, kemosabe.

521
00:53:32,511 --> 00:53:34,805
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

522
00:53:34,888 --> 00:53:37,432
into the Hall of Human Deformities.

523
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,602
Fun and educational for you, sir.

524
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:50,445
...trampling out the vintage

525
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:53,490
Where the grapes of wrath are stored...

526
00:53:54,324 --> 00:53:57,244
God has forsaken all you sinners,

527
00:53:57,327 --> 00:54:00,622
and now the armies of hell are upon us.

528
00:54:01,248 --> 00:54:03,542
Heathen. Heathen!

529
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:07,504
Heathen in our midst!

530
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:09,339
Heathen!

531
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:13,927
I'm looking for a man.

532
00:54:15,262 --> 00:54:16,346
I bet.

533
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:18,640
Got money?

534
00:54:18,724 --> 00:54:19,975
Of course.

535
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:26,690
Where did you get that?

536
00:54:26,773 --> 00:54:27,774
Make trade.

537
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,736
With a dead man?

538
00:54:31,236 --> 00:54:32,613
Hard bargain.

539
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:55,260
So...

540
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,347
Are all these women professionals?

541
00:54:58,597 --> 00:55:01,016
Sickness of greed is strong.

542
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,435
What about her?

543
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:06,772
Oh, yes. Her, too.

544
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:11,109
So how do you know all this?

545
00:55:11,193 --> 00:55:13,529
A vision said it would be so.

546
00:55:13,612 --> 00:55:14,696
Hmm.

547
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,114
Hi, Tonto.

548
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:28,752
Couple of freaks here to see you.

549
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:30,254
Mmm-hmm. Thank you, Homer.

550
00:55:30,337 --> 00:55:31,797
Just let me do the talking.

551
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:34,800
Ma'am.

552
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,886
What's with the mask?

553
00:55:39,638 --> 00:55:41,306
Second thought, don't answer that.

554
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,475
No, one thing you learn in my business.

555
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:46,311
Killers, preachers,
war heroes, railroaders...

556
00:55:46,395 --> 00:55:47,896
Every man has his thing.

557
00:55:49,189 --> 00:55:51,900
Railroaders?
Are you referring to Mr Cole?

558
00:55:52,985 --> 00:55:54,903
Oh, no, not Mr Cole. No.

559
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:57,364
By all reports, Mr Cole is, uh...

560
00:55:57,447 --> 00:55:59,157
Well, he is no longer guided

561
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:00,617
by the same imperatives as other men.

562
00:56:02,786 --> 00:56:04,413
Mr Cole gelding.

563
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,206
Come to think of it, there was talk

564
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,250
of an incident during the war.

565
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,418
Let go of me!

566
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,503
I won't let you go!

567
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:14,840
Whoa!

568
00:56:17,259 --> 00:56:19,094
No free rides, gentlemen!

569
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,851
Scrimshaw.

570
00:56:26,101 --> 00:56:27,269
Ivory.

571
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:29,021
- I want to touch.
- Uh-uh!

572
00:56:29,396 --> 00:56:31,189
Not if you favour your hand.

573
00:56:32,524 --> 00:56:35,277
We're looking for a man named Collins.

574
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,696
He's a tracker, speaks Indian.

575
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,406
Never heard of him.

576
00:56:40,282 --> 00:56:41,491
I see.

577
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:43,702
Well...

578
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:46,330
Coming in here,
we did happen to notice a number

579
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:48,665
of fairly serious health code violations.

580
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:49,750
Hmm.

581
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,753
It is a house of sin.

582
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:54,588
Yes, well, one with evidence

583
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:56,590
of livestock on the premises,

584
00:56:56,673 --> 00:56:58,800
inadequately marked fire escapes,

585
00:56:58,884 --> 00:57:01,303
and a fairly sinister-looking
jar of pickles on the bar.

586
00:57:01,386 --> 00:57:02,512
Hmm. Pickles?

587
00:57:02,721 --> 00:57:04,264
Unrefrigerated.

588
00:57:04,473 --> 00:57:06,183
I'd hate to have to shut you down.

589
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:07,559
You want to shut down the rail road?

590
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:08,810
- Yes.
- No.

591
00:57:08,894 --> 00:57:10,479
- Yes.
- Well, then you have a problem,

592
00:57:10,562 --> 00:57:11,813
because there ain't no rail road

593
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:13,815
without girls like mine
doing the heavy lifting.

594
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:16,318
Homer, help these morons find the door.

595
00:57:19,404 --> 00:57:21,198
Windigo getting away.

596
00:57:21,448 --> 00:57:22,699
What the hell is he talking about?

597
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:24,868
Nothing. It's an Indian thing.

598
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:28,121
Man who has taste for human flesh.

599
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:33,418
Butch Cavendish.

600
00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:36,713
That's right.

601
00:57:41,093 --> 00:57:42,761
Well, why didn't you just say so?

602
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:45,680
Collins was in about
a week ago with a lawman.

603
00:57:45,764 --> 00:57:47,766
Ranger like you, as a matter of fact.

604
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:49,935
Said his name was, uh, Reid.

605
00:57:50,894 --> 00:57:51,895
Dan Reid?

606
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:53,855
Had themselves
a hell of an argument.

607
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:54,940
What about?

608
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:56,233
Something
they found in the desert.

609
00:57:56,692 --> 00:57:58,110
Paid me with this.

610
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:03,198
Do not touch rock!

611
00:58:04,574 --> 00:58:05,992
Rock cursed.

612
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,306
lnjun's right. Worthless around here.

613
00:58:28,473 --> 00:58:29,891
But get it to San Francisco,

614
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:32,310
they'd pay a thousand dollars cash.

615
00:58:32,477 --> 00:58:34,813
Maybe I'll be on the first train west.

616
00:58:34,896 --> 00:58:36,565
Retire.

617
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,527
Do you have cat?

618
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,611
I did.

619
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,405
I thought he'd be an improvement

620
00:58:43,488 --> 00:58:44,823
on the last man in my life,

621
00:58:44,906 --> 00:58:45,907
but maybe it's me.

622
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:48,034
Red, we got trouble.

623
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:56,585
What are you doing?

624
00:58:56,668 --> 00:58:58,879
Comanche gesture of respect.

625
00:58:59,129 --> 00:59:01,006
Taste another man's drink.

626
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:02,340
Oh. Right.

627
00:59:02,424 --> 00:59:04,468
- Thank you.
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to

628
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:05,844
bring our little visit to a close.

629
00:59:05,927 --> 00:59:08,680
Some of my clientele don't take kindly
to an Indian on the premises.

630
00:59:10,974 --> 00:59:12,934
He has as much right
to be here as anyone else.

631
00:59:13,018 --> 00:59:15,312
Not since the Comanche
violated the treaty.

632
00:59:15,812 --> 00:59:17,522
- Treaty?
- You didn't hear?

633
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:19,733
They've been raiding settlements
up and down the river.

634
00:59:20,984 --> 00:59:22,694
My God. Rebecca.

635
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:26,531
Fear of cat.

636
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:29,034
Better go out the back.

637
00:59:31,703 --> 00:59:32,871
How do I thank you?

638
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:36,958
Just make that animal pay
for what he took from me.

639
00:59:41,505 --> 00:59:42,631
Hey!

640
00:59:50,055 --> 00:59:52,724
Nature is indeed out of balance.

641
01:00:04,528 --> 01:00:05,695
Come. Must to go.

642
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:08,073
Must to go, drunken beast!

643
01:00:09,991 --> 01:00:11,910
'Tis judgment day, harlot!

644
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:13,161
Oh.

645
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:14,579
May I help you?

646
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:15,830
Where are they?

647
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:18,166
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.

648
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:21,086
Ma'am, I believe I've located your...

649
01:00:23,255 --> 01:00:24,422
...cat.

650
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:27,133
Ma'am.

651
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:29,010
Get him!

652
01:00:29,344 --> 01:00:30,971
There's the redskin!

653
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:52,742
Where you runnin', lnjun?

654
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:55,287
What the hell is wrong
with these people?

655
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,330
Blood has been spilled, kemosabe.

656
01:00:58,248 --> 01:01:00,959
And soon, rivers run red.

657
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:09,676
Oh, God...

658
01:01:13,805 --> 01:01:15,640
Let's call it a night, Joe.

659
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:17,559
Yes, ma'am.

660
01:01:31,323 --> 01:01:32,824
Come on, Danny.

661
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:31,841
Get yourselves inside!

662
01:02:32,008 --> 01:02:33,301
Danny, come on.

663
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:35,512
Pilar, get the shutters.

664
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:19,139
Pilar, fire!

665
01:04:06,478 --> 01:04:08,146
Indian savages.

666
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:11,149
Was not Indian.

667
01:04:12,484 --> 01:04:13,902
The hell it wasn't.

668
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:17,614
Indians make trade.

669
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:22,410
Leave him alone.

670
01:04:24,454 --> 01:04:25,455
I said leave him alone!

671
01:04:27,832 --> 01:04:29,626
Indian is like coyote.

672
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:32,212
He kill and leave nothing to waste.

673
01:04:32,879 --> 01:04:34,672
Tell me, kemosabe,

674
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:37,926
what does the white man kill for?

675
01:04:53,233 --> 01:04:55,360
This one's nice, ain't it?

676
01:04:58,279 --> 01:04:59,948
I love me some aquamarine.

677
01:05:06,246 --> 01:05:07,455
Not an Indian.

678
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:10,041
This ain't what it looks like, mister.

679
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,293
I just like them pretty things.

680
01:05:12,377 --> 01:05:14,963
Rebecca and Danny. Where are they?

681
01:05:16,631 --> 01:05:19,884
You tell me where they are, or I'll let
the Indian do what he wants to you.

682
01:05:21,386 --> 01:05:23,513
What does he want to do?

683
01:05:33,189 --> 01:05:34,524
What the hell is going on?

684
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:36,484
There's a Ranger.

685
01:05:36,568 --> 01:05:37,819
What are you talking about?

686
01:05:37,902 --> 01:05:40,071
He got some lunatic Indian with him.

687
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:42,740
He was gonna violate me
with a duck foot.

688
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:52,000
You shoot anything that comes out.

689
01:06:01,885 --> 01:06:03,595
Go for horse, kemosabe.

690
01:06:04,971 --> 01:06:06,139
I cover you.

691
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:10,143
Why don't I cover you?

692
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:11,936
You have been to the other side.

693
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,230
Spirit Walker cannot be killed.

694
01:06:17,775 --> 01:06:19,110
All right.

695
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:21,863
But we take them alive.

696
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:26,159
Texas Ranger!

697
01:06:26,576 --> 01:06:28,995
Put down your weapons
and step out with your hands up!

698
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:36,252
It's dark!

699
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:39,130
Spirit Walker.

700
01:06:39,964 --> 01:06:42,133
See! What did I tell you?

701
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:43,801
Go around back.

702
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:49,349
What's with the mask?

703
01:07:22,507 --> 01:07:23,675
What is it?

704
01:07:31,015 --> 01:07:32,642
So, the horse,

705
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:34,852
it can fly?

706
01:07:36,229 --> 01:07:37,897
Don't be stupid.

707
01:07:52,662 --> 01:07:54,038
Hold it right there.

708
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:58,543
Rebecca and Danny,

709
01:07:59,127 --> 01:08:00,420
where are they?

710
01:08:00,712 --> 01:08:03,006
Comanche don't take no prisoners.

711
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:04,549
Just the scalps.

712
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:06,968
Isn't that right, boy?

713
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:15,226
I will take the Spaniard.

714
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:19,397
I haven't fired a gun
in nine years.

715
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,402
Might want to keep that
to yourself, kemosabe.

716
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:42,962
Great shot!

717
01:08:43,254 --> 01:08:45,256
That was supposed
to be a warning shot.

718
01:08:46,049 --> 01:08:47,633
In that case, not so good.

719
01:08:54,474 --> 01:08:55,475
What?

720
01:08:57,185 --> 01:08:58,269
Nothing.

721
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,960
That was my brother's.

722
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:25,755
Comanche.

723
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:28,174
Very sacred.

724
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:34,514
How am I supposed
to find Rebecca and Danny now?

725
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:38,142
Tracks lead north,
toward Indian country.

726
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:41,646
That's 400 square miles
of rock and desert.

727
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:42,855
Even an Indian can't track through that.

728
01:09:43,397 --> 01:09:45,775
We follow horse, kemosabe.

729
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:51,364
"Kemosa..." Why do you
keep calling me that?

730
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:52,740
What's that mean?

731
01:09:56,494 --> 01:09:57,745
"Wrong brother."

732
01:10:00,164 --> 01:10:01,249
Right.

733
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:15,096
My husband will kill you for this.

734
01:10:16,097 --> 01:10:18,057
That'd be a trick.

735
01:10:20,893 --> 01:10:23,437
Last time I saw your husband,

736
01:10:23,604 --> 01:10:25,690
he was drowning in his own blood.

737
01:10:29,777 --> 01:10:30,778
We got company.

738
01:10:30,862 --> 01:10:32,071
Hold up!

739
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:34,198
It's Frank.

740
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,460
Where's Barret and Jesus?

741
01:10:47,753 --> 01:10:49,130
He killed them.

742
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:50,590
Straight draw.

743
01:10:51,215 --> 01:10:54,051
Fired one bullet
and they didn't stand a chance.

744
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,429
You better start talking straight, Frank.

745
01:10:56,512 --> 01:10:57,930
Now, who killed them?

746
01:11:00,016 --> 01:11:02,101
It was a Ranger, Butch.

747
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:04,687
A lone Ranger.

748
01:11:09,484 --> 01:11:10,651
Rangers are dead.

749
01:11:13,988 --> 01:11:15,156
The ghost of Dan Reid.

750
01:11:15,281 --> 01:11:16,490
Frank!

751
01:11:16,908 --> 01:11:17,909
He coming for you.

752
01:11:19,744 --> 01:11:21,245
You shouldn't have done what you did.

753
01:11:21,662 --> 01:11:22,914
- Shut up!

754
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:25,583
Let him come!

755
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:28,085
I killed him once.

756
01:11:28,628 --> 01:11:31,589
I won't have to answer for it
when I kill him again.

757
01:11:31,756 --> 01:11:33,341
Scared, aren't you?

758
01:11:38,137 --> 01:11:39,472
You should be.

759
01:11:47,021 --> 01:11:48,022
Hey, Collins.

760
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:52,860
Do you know
what the Indians call this place?

761
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,155
"The Valley of Tears."

762
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:10,336
Please don't do this. Please, don't...

763
01:12:14,382 --> 01:12:15,967
Mmm!

764
01:12:18,886 --> 01:12:19,971
That's far enough.

765
01:12:26,143 --> 01:12:27,144
Don't look at me.

766
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:29,146
He loved you.

767
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:32,525
I said, don't look at me.

768
01:12:44,245 --> 01:12:45,913
Run.

769
01:12:47,164 --> 01:12:48,708
Please, run.

770
01:12:52,962 --> 01:12:54,088
Danny, come on.

771
01:12:57,383 --> 01:12:58,676
Mama?

772
01:13:15,401 --> 01:13:16,944
Why would Cavendish
make it look

773
01:13:17,028 --> 01:13:19,530
like the Comanche violated the treaty?

774
01:13:19,697 --> 01:13:20,698
It has something to do

775
01:13:20,823 --> 01:13:21,866
with what my brother found in the desert.

776
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,660
Perhaps he want to make it look

777
01:13:24,744 --> 01:13:26,996
like Comanche violate treaty.

778
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:30,374
That's very helpful, thank you.

779
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:31,876
Whoa.

780
01:13:32,543 --> 01:13:34,003
What is it?

781
01:14:02,573 --> 01:14:04,075
Horse dead.

782
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:07,078
I can see that. Now what?

783
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:13,751
We're lost, aren't we?

784
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:15,795
I knew it.

785
01:14:15,961 --> 01:14:17,963
Just follow the horse.
That was your idea?

786
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,591
But you can't talk
to a dead horse, now, can you?

787
01:14:20,758 --> 01:14:22,760
You know what? Let me try.

788
01:14:24,095 --> 01:14:27,306
Hello. If you could
just point us in the right direction,

789
01:14:27,473 --> 01:14:28,933
we'll take it from here.

790
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,309
What's that?

791
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:31,936
Nothing!

792
01:14:36,982 --> 01:14:39,193
That's just fantastic, isn't it?
Cavendish is out there somewhere,

793
01:14:39,276 --> 01:14:40,986
doing God-knows-what
to Rebecca and Danny,

794
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:42,697
and I'm gonna die
here in the desert with you

795
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,281
and that ridiculous bird!

796
01:14:48,285 --> 01:14:50,079
The woman, Rebecca,

797
01:14:50,246 --> 01:14:52,456
you will fill her with child, no?

798
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:53,624
What?

799
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:54,792
No!

800
01:14:54,959 --> 01:14:56,419
That's my brother's wife.

801
01:14:57,128 --> 01:14:58,963
When you were on the other side,

802
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:01,632
you spoke of her in your vision.

803
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:06,262
Well, lack of oxygen
can cause the brain to hallucinate.

804
01:15:06,345 --> 01:15:07,680
Everyone knows that.

805
01:15:07,805 --> 01:15:08,806
Yes,

806
01:15:09,473 --> 01:15:13,310
but you did not speak of her
as the wife of your brother.

807
01:15:15,604 --> 01:15:17,606
Well, she's his widow now.

808
01:15:17,982 --> 01:15:20,359
So, it is better that
she live the rest of her life alone?

809
01:15:20,484 --> 01:15:22,695
Yes. No.

810
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:26,657
Look, it just isn't done.
You wouldn't understand.

811
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,034
Because I am a savage?

812
01:15:44,133 --> 01:15:46,010
Would you stop?

813
01:15:46,177 --> 01:15:47,261
You can't track.

814
01:15:47,344 --> 01:15:50,222
If you could, we wouldn't be
out here in the first place!

815
01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:56,896
What is that?

816
01:15:57,688 --> 01:15:58,689
Track!

817
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:02,359
That's impossible.

818
01:16:08,032 --> 01:16:09,700
Train track.

819
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:16,248
You are lost, aren't you?

820
01:16:17,249 --> 01:16:19,001
Train tracks?

821
01:16:19,168 --> 01:16:21,212
I thought you were in Indian territory.

822
01:16:22,838 --> 01:16:24,006
Yes.

823
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:54,119
Let the Comanche make no mistake.

824
01:16:54,203 --> 01:16:57,414
We will not be dissuaded from our task.

825
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,083
From here on,

826
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,835
all treaties with the Indian Nation

827
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:03,587
are null and void.

828
01:17:04,588 --> 01:17:06,215
We will be in Promontory Summit

829
01:17:06,298 --> 01:17:07,424
ahead of schedule,

830
01:17:07,758 --> 01:17:09,969
three days from today!

831
01:17:10,135 --> 01:17:13,472
Now, go ahead. Put that in your paper.

832
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:17,226
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

833
01:17:18,727 --> 01:17:19,770
Sir?

834
01:17:21,105 --> 01:17:22,439
It arrived last night.

835
01:17:23,941 --> 01:17:25,985
I had to dip into petty cash.

836
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:27,987
Put it somewhere safe.

837
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:30,239
Where would that be?

838
01:17:30,906 --> 01:17:32,616
Use your imagination.

839
01:17:42,251 --> 01:17:44,295
I understand you have
an Indian problem.

840
01:17:45,796 --> 01:17:47,339
Right on time.

841
01:18:06,984 --> 01:18:08,611
I thought you said I couldn't get shot.

842
01:18:10,112 --> 01:18:11,280
No.

843
01:18:11,655 --> 01:18:13,490
I said you could not be killed.

844
01:18:13,616 --> 01:18:14,700
Oh.

845
01:18:17,703 --> 01:18:18,829
Apache?

846
01:18:19,038 --> 01:18:20,247
Comanche.

847
01:18:20,414 --> 01:18:21,415
Well, that's good, right?

848
01:18:22,374 --> 01:18:24,001
Not so much.

849
01:18:26,503 --> 01:18:27,588
What are they doing?

850
01:18:28,339 --> 01:18:29,340
Death dance.

851
01:18:29,423 --> 01:18:31,550
They are preparing for war
with the white man.

852
01:18:31,717 --> 01:18:32,885
War?

853
01:18:34,219 --> 01:18:35,220
Wait.

854
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,681
Is that thing sterile?

855
01:18:37,765 --> 01:18:40,059
Yes. I make urine on it.

856
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:41,393
What?

857
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:45,272
War?

858
01:18:45,356 --> 01:18:47,691
But the Comanche didn't
attack the settlements!

859
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,944
White man does not know this.

860
01:18:51,612 --> 01:18:52,988
But you're going to tell them.

861
01:18:53,072 --> 01:18:56,033
I mean, you did tell them, right?

862
01:19:10,464 --> 01:19:11,966
My name's John Reid,

863
01:19:12,132 --> 01:19:14,218
and I know that you didn't
raid those settlements.

864
01:19:14,385 --> 01:19:16,470
If you let me go, I can prove it.

865
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:20,391
There doesn't have to
be a war, understand?

866
01:19:22,393 --> 01:19:25,145
No. Of course you don't.

867
01:19:31,902 --> 01:19:33,070
Mmm!

868
01:19:33,946 --> 01:19:36,490
Good. Good.

869
01:19:37,074 --> 01:19:40,119
Me, Spirit Walker

870
01:19:40,285 --> 01:19:41,995
from great beyond.

871
01:19:42,996 --> 01:19:46,625
The hunter of wendingo

872
01:19:47,668 --> 01:19:49,086
and the other things.

873
01:19:49,795 --> 01:19:51,505
Sunstroke?

874
01:19:51,922 --> 01:19:55,300
Or his mind is poisoned with whiskey.

875
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:04,810
Comanche gesture of respect?

876
01:20:06,103 --> 01:20:07,688
What's with the mask?

877
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:11,066
What?

878
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,693
Tonto told you these things?

879
01:20:13,819 --> 01:20:14,820
That's right.

880
01:20:14,945 --> 01:20:17,114
And he told you to wear the mask?

881
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:25,539
That's funny?

882
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:26,790
Very funny.

883
01:20:26,957 --> 01:20:27,958
Tonto's a Comanche.

884
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:29,877
He's one of you.

885
01:20:31,545 --> 01:20:33,005
No more.

886
01:20:37,384 --> 01:20:39,136
What do you mean?

887
01:20:41,138 --> 01:20:43,640
His mind is broken.

888
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,979
He is a band apart.

889
01:20:55,152 --> 01:20:56,987
Many moons ago,

890
01:20:57,321 --> 01:21:01,492
a boy found two white men
in the desert.

891
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:14,046
He brought them to
his village to be healed.

892
01:21:25,432 --> 01:21:27,768
When they found silver in the river,

893
01:21:28,894 --> 01:21:31,230
they asked the boy where it came from.

894
01:21:52,251 --> 01:21:54,419
In exchange for a cheap pocket watch

895
01:21:54,545 --> 01:21:56,213
from Sears Roebuck,

896
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:00,717
the boy showed them
where the river begins,

897
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:06,640
where they found more silver

898
01:22:06,723 --> 01:22:09,768
than any white man had ever seen.

899
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:15,107
They took what they could carry,

900
01:22:15,774 --> 01:22:19,069
but they wanted to
keep the place a secret,

901
01:22:19,236 --> 01:22:21,613
so they could one day return.

902
01:23:05,824 --> 01:23:09,745
The boy could not live
with what he had done,

903
01:23:10,787 --> 01:23:12,998
so he decided the men were possessed

904
01:23:13,123 --> 01:23:15,626
by evil spirits in the silver.

905
01:23:20,464 --> 01:23:22,799
He called it "windigo,"

906
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:26,303
like the ghost stories
we tell our children.

907
01:23:34,978 --> 01:23:36,480
And he made a vow.

908
01:23:36,813 --> 01:23:39,149
When he found these two men,

909
01:23:39,316 --> 01:23:40,651
he would drain their blood

910
01:23:40,734 --> 01:23:43,487
into the soil of his ancestors,

911
01:23:46,156 --> 01:23:49,493
so he could return to the tribe.

912
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:55,123
But he is too late.

913
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:58,627
There is no more tribe to return to.

914
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:01,505
Our time has passed.

915
01:24:02,297 --> 01:24:05,842
They call it "progress."

916
01:24:09,763 --> 01:24:13,100
You're John Reid, brother of Dan.

917
01:24:14,518 --> 01:24:15,602
Yes.

918
01:24:17,604 --> 01:24:19,356
By this totem, your brother swore

919
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:20,607
if we kept the peace,

920
01:24:20,691 --> 01:24:22,943
he would protect our land.

921
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,946
Now the Cavalry cut down our children.

922
01:24:26,113 --> 01:24:29,783
Like all white men, your brother lied.

923
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:32,619
No. No, Dan was murdered.

924
01:24:32,786 --> 01:24:35,414
And if you let me go,
I'll keep his promise.

925
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:40,043
So, we have a deal?

926
01:24:43,297 --> 01:24:45,340
Not so much.

927
01:24:48,802 --> 01:24:51,054
My name come up?

928
01:24:57,519 --> 01:24:59,563
Please, this is a mistake.

929
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,732
There doesn't need to be a war.

930
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:03,233
It makes no difference.

931
01:25:04,317 --> 01:25:06,528
We are already ghosts.

932
01:25:16,663 --> 01:25:17,789
Shh! Shh!

933
01:25:21,501 --> 01:25:22,753
Cavalry.

934
01:25:23,295 --> 01:25:24,921
Let us bring the pure sceptre

935
01:25:25,005 --> 01:25:27,466
of Almighty God
to the heathens!

936
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:31,678
Oh, thank God! Civilisation.

937
01:25:31,845 --> 01:25:34,014
We'll just explain the entire situation,

938
01:25:34,181 --> 01:25:36,725
and we'll get this whole
misunderstanding cleared up.

939
01:25:36,892 --> 01:25:38,560
The United States Army.

940
01:25:38,643 --> 01:25:40,520
Finally someone
who will listen to reason.

941
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:52,824
Help! Over here!

942
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:55,077
Wait!

943
01:25:58,413 --> 01:26:00,165
Perhaps they didn't see us.

944
01:26:00,332 --> 01:26:01,583
Oh, no.

945
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,002
They will be back any minute now.

946
01:26:07,798 --> 01:26:08,965
Could be worse.

947
01:26:10,008 --> 01:26:11,134
Worse?

948
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,345
How could this be worse?

949
01:26:13,512 --> 01:26:15,430
Could develop an itch

950
01:26:17,849 --> 01:26:19,684
on your nose.

951
01:26:25,023 --> 01:26:27,192
I'm not talking to you any more.

952
01:26:34,866 --> 01:26:35,867
What is that?

953
01:26:36,868 --> 01:26:38,161
You hear it, too?

954
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,997
I was hoping it was in my head.

955
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:49,548
This is worse.

956
01:26:51,049 --> 01:26:52,676
Hmm.

957
01:26:55,512 --> 01:26:58,014
Nature is most definitely...

958
01:26:58,807 --> 01:26:59,808
- Out of balance.
- Mmm.

959
01:27:11,027 --> 01:27:12,028
Hello again.

960
01:27:14,364 --> 01:27:15,824
Any chance you could...

961
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:29,713
Atta boy! Yes! Thank you.

962
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:31,506
Uh...

963
01:27:37,262 --> 01:27:38,263
Ah!

964
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:41,558
Here we go, okay, go!

965
01:27:49,107 --> 01:27:50,400
Thank you.

966
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,280
Going, kemosabe?

967
01:27:55,405 --> 01:27:56,573
Uh-huh.

968
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,533
To find Rebecca and Danny?

969
01:27:58,617 --> 01:27:59,701
Yup.

970
01:27:59,868 --> 01:28:01,745
- To capture Cavendish?
- That's right.

971
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,246
Hmm.

972
01:28:03,455 --> 01:28:05,207
Where the river begins?

973
01:28:05,373 --> 01:28:06,583
Exactly.

974
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,963
It is a good day to die.

975
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:14,090
Yeah, well,

976
01:28:14,257 --> 01:28:15,634
same to you.

977
01:28:16,134 --> 01:28:17,302
Come on.

978
01:28:32,108 --> 01:28:33,526
"Where the river begins."

979
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:35,779
You know where that is, don't you?

980
01:28:45,914 --> 01:28:48,458
Where the river begins.

981
01:29:03,139 --> 01:29:04,140
Oh!

982
01:29:04,266 --> 01:29:07,435
Sorry, Butch. it was a accident. I'm...

983
01:29:07,602 --> 01:29:09,062
I didn't mean it.

984
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:14,734
What the hell is that damn noise?

985
01:29:17,904 --> 01:29:20,740
Sorry, Butch.
They say they won't go inside no more.

986
01:29:20,907 --> 01:29:22,993
Indian spirits or some damn thing.

987
01:29:23,118 --> 01:29:25,161
They say they causing the cave-ins.

988
01:29:26,746 --> 01:29:28,123
He the one doing the talking?

989
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:29,624
That's right.

990
01:29:32,168 --> 01:29:34,212
Anybody else want to negotiate?

991
01:29:34,296 --> 01:29:35,297
You?

992
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:39,759
They don't even speak English, Butch.

993
01:29:39,884 --> 01:29:41,720
I think they understood.

994
01:29:42,387 --> 01:29:45,015
Now go show them
there's nothing to be afraid of.

995
01:29:48,101 --> 01:29:50,061
Do I have to ask twice?

996
01:29:51,521 --> 01:29:53,398
I've been thinking.

997
01:29:55,191 --> 01:29:58,361
Why don't we just take
what we can carry

998
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,988
and get out of here?

999
01:30:01,448 --> 01:30:04,367
I mean, hell, we already rich.

1000
01:30:05,243 --> 01:30:06,286
Right?

1001
01:30:08,413 --> 01:30:09,831
Scraps?

1002
01:30:10,915 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah.

1003
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:14,878
You think I waited 20 years

1004
01:30:15,795 --> 01:30:17,589
for scraps?

1005
01:30:18,506 --> 01:30:20,216
I'm taking all of it!

1006
01:30:20,383 --> 01:30:21,426
Every damn piece!

1007
01:30:21,551 --> 01:30:22,677
I'm sorry!

1008
01:30:22,844 --> 01:30:26,097
Now, get in there
before I put a hole in you!

1009
01:30:27,599 --> 01:30:28,725
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1010
01:30:29,059 --> 01:30:30,518
Get in there.

1011
01:30:58,171 --> 01:30:59,464
Frank?

1012
01:31:02,509 --> 01:31:03,676
Ray,

1013
01:31:05,011 --> 01:31:06,012
Skinny,

1014
01:31:06,471 --> 01:31:08,139
90 get him.

1015
01:31:08,807 --> 01:31:09,808
Frank?

1016
01:32:24,549 --> 01:32:26,551
It can't be.

1017
01:32:29,345 --> 01:32:31,681
The Rangers are dead.

1018
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:41,691
Where are they?

1019
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:44,903
You're dead.

1020
01:32:49,407 --> 01:32:51,409
Rebecca and Danny.

1021
01:32:51,576 --> 01:32:53,912
If you hurt them, I swear
to God, I'll make you pay.

1022
01:32:56,206 --> 01:32:58,708
...to the full extent of the law.

1023
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:01,169
I'll be damned.

1024
01:33:01,336 --> 01:33:04,005
Lawyer and a crazy lnjun.

1025
01:33:05,757 --> 01:33:06,883
Tell me.

1026
01:33:13,932 --> 01:33:15,558
Had a nice smell on her.

1027
01:33:16,351 --> 01:33:17,560
Didn't she?

1028
01:33:31,574 --> 01:33:32,575
See?

1029
01:33:33,076 --> 01:33:35,078
You're no spirit.

1030
01:33:35,537 --> 01:33:37,539
You're just a man in a mask.

1031
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:42,252
You're no different than me.

1032
01:33:45,755 --> 01:33:47,549
Finish him.

1033
01:33:47,966 --> 01:33:49,092
No.

1034
01:33:50,093 --> 01:33:51,594
This isn't justice.

1035
01:33:51,761 --> 01:33:53,471
Justice

1036
01:33:53,596 --> 01:33:56,432
is what a man must take for himself.

1037
01:33:58,268 --> 01:34:00,311
No, I can't believe that.

1038
01:34:00,478 --> 01:34:01,771
I won't.

1039
01:34:01,938 --> 01:34:04,315
Windigo cut out brother's heart.

1040
01:34:05,316 --> 01:34:07,318
Where is brother's justice?

1041
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:09,654
I'm not a savage.

1042
01:34:12,407 --> 01:34:14,284
You are not a man.

1043
01:34:15,118 --> 01:34:17,078
- I will do it.
- Wait.

1044
01:34:20,582 --> 01:34:23,293
You keep me from my destiny once.

1045
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:25,461
It will not happen again.

1046
01:34:26,796 --> 01:34:28,798
Now, windigo must die.

1047
01:34:28,965 --> 01:34:31,759
There's no such thing as a wendingo.

1048
01:34:32,468 --> 01:34:34,053
You made it up.

1049
01:34:34,637 --> 01:34:36,973
Like you make up everything.

1050
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:40,393
You sold out your whole village
for a watch.

1051
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,563
And now you're an outcast.
You're a band apart.

1052
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:44,731
A messed up little kid

1053
01:34:44,814 --> 01:34:47,483
who couldn't live with what you did.

1054
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:50,403
There's no such thing as cursed silver,

1055
01:34:50,612 --> 01:34:53,114
or a Spirit Walker for that matter.

1056
01:34:53,823 --> 01:34:55,325
I'm not like you.

1057
01:34:55,783 --> 01:34:56,993
I have a tribe.

1058
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:01,664
You have nothing.

1059
01:35:02,165 --> 01:35:03,666
Like me.

1060
01:35:05,752 --> 01:35:07,170
You're wrong.

1061
01:35:07,337 --> 01:35:10,757
Go back to your tribe, white coward.

1062
01:35:12,008 --> 01:35:13,843
I do not need you.

1063
01:35:21,017 --> 01:35:22,185
Look at me.

1064
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:26,522
See the face of my people

1065
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:28,149
as you die.

1066
01:35:30,318 --> 01:35:32,570
I knew I could count on you, Counsellor.

1067
01:35:32,737 --> 01:35:34,238
Shut up.

1068
01:35:58,304 --> 01:35:59,305
Hey.

1069
01:35:59,889 --> 01:36:01,557
Where am I?

1070
01:36:03,351 --> 01:36:04,644
Drink.

1071
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:07,438
Feel better.

1072
01:36:21,911 --> 01:36:24,247
Your tactics
have been most effective, Captain.

1073
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:25,790
With the natives in retreat,

1074
01:36:25,873 --> 01:36:27,625
we'll be in Promontory Summit
ahead of schedule.

1075
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:31,087
Believe me, what they have done to the
settlements we have given back tenfold.

1076
01:36:32,922 --> 01:36:34,424
Tenfold.

1077
01:36:38,219 --> 01:36:41,014
Danny, I told you,
take it easy on the corners

1078
01:36:41,097 --> 01:36:42,807
and press down on the straightaway.

1079
01:36:42,974 --> 01:36:44,934
It's just a toy.

1080
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:48,146
Come here, Danny.

1081
01:36:48,312 --> 01:36:49,647
I want to show you something.

1082
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:53,901
Since the time of Alexander the Great

1083
01:36:54,068 --> 01:36:55,611
no man has travelled faster

1084
01:36:55,695 --> 01:36:57,363
than the horse that carried him.

1085
01:36:57,864 --> 01:36:59,365
Not any more.

1086
01:36:59,782 --> 01:37:04,120
Imagine, an entire continent
connected by iron rail.

1087
01:37:04,287 --> 01:37:07,206
That's fuel for our cities.
Metals for our factories.

1088
01:37:07,373 --> 01:37:09,792
Food for the masses.

1089
01:37:11,627 --> 01:37:14,130
Whoever controls this,

1090
01:37:14,297 --> 01:37:16,466
controls the future.

1091
01:37:17,008 --> 01:37:20,636
Power that makes emperors and kings

1092
01:37:20,803 --> 01:37:22,138
look like fools.

1093
01:37:26,809 --> 01:37:28,561
You mean it's mine?

1094
01:37:28,728 --> 01:37:31,022
It could be, son.

1095
01:37:31,814 --> 01:37:34,317
Could be all yours.

1096
01:37:37,653 --> 01:37:39,697
Rebecca. Feeling better?

1097
01:37:39,989 --> 01:37:42,200
Look what Mr Cole got me, Mama.

1098
01:37:42,325 --> 01:37:43,326
Huh!

1099
01:37:43,409 --> 01:37:44,786
Danny...

1100
01:37:44,869 --> 01:37:45,870
Oh!

1101
01:37:46,662 --> 01:37:48,331
Well, it was the least I could do

1102
01:37:48,414 --> 01:37:49,707
after what you've been through.

1103
01:37:49,832 --> 01:37:52,668
You should consider yourself
a lucky woman, Mrs Reid.

1104
01:37:52,835 --> 01:37:55,046
Had Mr Cole not
come along when he did

1105
01:37:55,213 --> 01:37:57,173
with those outlaws,
who knows what manner

1106
01:37:57,256 --> 01:37:58,674
of violations might have transpired...

1107
01:37:58,841 --> 01:38:00,176
Captain. Captain, please.

1108
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:01,511
The boy.

1109
01:38:01,677 --> 01:38:03,096
We're indebted to you.

1110
01:38:03,262 --> 01:38:05,848
Oh, no. It is I who is indebted.

1111
01:38:06,015 --> 01:38:09,685
Ever since the war, I prayed
that God might send me

1112
01:38:09,852 --> 01:38:12,939
a family that I could care for.

1113
01:38:13,272 --> 01:38:14,857
And now he has.

1114
01:38:15,525 --> 01:38:16,567
Wait.

1115
01:38:17,401 --> 01:38:19,195
There's one left.

1116
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:21,030
- I'm sorry?
- A Ranger.

1117
01:38:23,282 --> 01:38:24,367
A Ranger is still alive.

1118
01:38:24,534 --> 01:38:25,618
No, ma'am.

1119
01:38:25,785 --> 01:38:27,620
My troopers found seven graves.

1120
01:38:27,787 --> 01:38:29,372
So, perhaps when you fell
and hit your head...

1121
01:38:29,455 --> 01:38:30,456
Captain.

1122
01:38:31,999 --> 01:38:33,835
If there is a Ranger still alive,

1123
01:38:34,001 --> 01:38:37,004
we will scour the countryside
until we find him.

1124
01:38:37,547 --> 01:38:39,215
I promise you that.

1125
01:38:45,388 --> 01:38:46,848
Heavenly Father,

1126
01:38:47,014 --> 01:38:50,393
we call upon you in this,
our hour of need.

1127
01:38:52,061 --> 01:38:53,396
For you are the shepherd

1128
01:38:53,563 --> 01:38:56,858
that shall guide the wanderer
through the desert.

1129
01:38:57,024 --> 01:38:59,610
You are the light
that shall be his beacon

1130
01:38:59,735 --> 01:39:01,237
in the darkness.

1131
01:39:02,113 --> 01:39:04,448
And yours is the mighty sword

1132
01:39:04,574 --> 01:39:06,784
that shall strike down his enemies.

1133
01:39:07,285 --> 01:39:10,955
For he is on the path of righteousness.

1134
01:39:12,206 --> 01:39:13,583
Amen.

1135
01:39:25,386 --> 01:39:26,596
Latham Cole!

1136
01:39:26,762 --> 01:39:28,222
Sir!
Someone's coming in!

1137
01:39:28,306 --> 01:39:29,932
Sentries,
at your posts!

1138
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:39,442
- Daddy!
- Dan.

1139
01:39:41,277 --> 01:39:42,278
We don't know who's out there.

1140
01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:43,946
I intend to find out.

1141
01:39:44,071 --> 01:39:45,364
Latham Cole!

1142
01:39:45,448 --> 01:39:48,576
Wendell, take Mrs Reid
and her son to the supply car.

1143
01:39:48,951 --> 01:39:50,536
For their own safety.

1144
01:39:53,956 --> 01:39:54,957
What is it, friend?

1145
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,589
This is the man you've been looking for.

1146
01:40:05,801 --> 01:40:07,136
Butch Cavendish,

1147
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,388
just like one of those great lizards

1148
01:40:09,472 --> 01:40:10,932
buried in the desert.

1149
01:40:11,098 --> 01:40:12,266
The last of a dying breed.

1150
01:40:15,311 --> 01:40:16,312
That's enough.

1151
01:40:22,652 --> 01:40:24,820
I brought this man in for justice.

1152
01:40:26,822 --> 01:40:28,157
Of course.

1153
01:40:29,492 --> 01:40:31,619
Soldier.

1154
01:40:39,335 --> 01:40:41,337
I'm just doing my job, Mrs Reid.

1155
01:40:41,504 --> 01:40:42,546
You wanna keep me in this room,

1156
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:43,798
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1157
01:40:44,131 --> 01:40:45,257
Is that part of your job?

1158
01:40:47,718 --> 01:40:48,803
Whoa!

1159
01:40:49,303 --> 01:40:50,471
Danny.

1160
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:53,891
And don't let him leave.

1161
01:40:55,184 --> 01:40:56,435
But he's just a boy.

1162
01:40:57,228 --> 01:40:58,396
That's right.

1163
01:40:59,563 --> 01:41:00,648
Oh.

1164
01:41:00,982 --> 01:41:02,858
And he's got a twitchy finger, too.

1165
01:41:29,343 --> 01:41:31,262
Stupid white man.

1166
01:41:35,224 --> 01:41:37,393
There were rumours
that sustained us.

1167
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,103
A lone Ranger,

1168
01:41:39,395 --> 01:41:41,939
a masked man.

1169
01:41:42,064 --> 01:41:45,526
A ghost, some people said.

1170
01:41:46,402 --> 01:41:47,695
And now, here you are.

1171
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:51,240
Flesh and blood.

1172
01:41:51,782 --> 01:41:53,951
Civilised society
has no place for a masked man.

1173
01:41:54,076 --> 01:41:55,077
Of course not.

1174
01:41:56,078 --> 01:41:58,247
How can I thank you
for what you've done?

1175
01:41:58,914 --> 01:42:01,417
You can stop this war before it's too late.

1176
01:42:01,584 --> 01:42:03,169
Comanche didn't attack
those settlements.

1177
01:42:03,252 --> 01:42:05,671
It was Butch Cavendish and his gang.

1178
01:42:06,756 --> 01:42:08,424
All for this.

1179
01:42:16,098 --> 01:42:17,516
Butch Cavendish.

1180
01:42:20,394 --> 01:42:22,605
In one man,

1181
01:42:22,772 --> 01:42:25,775
everything I hate about this country.

1182
01:42:26,567 --> 01:42:28,569
No sense of the common good.

1183
01:42:29,612 --> 01:42:31,113
No vision.

1184
01:42:33,282 --> 01:42:34,533
Come to think of it,

1185
01:42:34,617 --> 01:42:37,411
not unlike your brother, Dan.

1186
01:43:00,309 --> 01:43:04,230
Men like that can't accept
what we know to be true.

1187
01:43:04,397 --> 01:43:06,315
A man can't stay the same

1188
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:09,402
with the world evolving around him.

1189
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,293
Remember me?

1190
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:29,713
But a man can't choose
his brother, can he?

1191
01:43:30,339 --> 01:43:33,634
It's almost as if his brother chooses him.

1192
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:36,929
You see, that's what we are.

1193
01:43:38,305 --> 01:43:39,473
Me and Butch.

1194
01:43:39,932 --> 01:43:41,475
Brothers.

1195
01:43:42,268 --> 01:43:44,228
Born in the desert.

1196
01:43:44,395 --> 01:43:46,188
All those years ago.

1197
01:43:50,317 --> 01:43:52,444
And now you've come back.

1198
01:43:53,362 --> 01:43:54,822
Train tracks.

1199
01:43:55,406 --> 01:43:57,783
That's what Dan found
in Indian Territory, isn't it?

1200
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:58,951
He knew there was gonna be a war

1201
01:43:59,034 --> 01:44:00,035
and he wouldn't go along with it,

1202
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:01,620
so you had him killed.

1203
01:44:01,787 --> 01:44:03,205
Like I said,

1204
01:44:03,289 --> 01:44:04,331
no vision.

1205
01:44:04,874 --> 01:44:07,001
Stop this train.

1206
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,336
Oh, there's no stopping this train, John.

1207
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:11,755
I think you know that.

1208
01:44:24,226 --> 01:44:25,936
Danny!

1209
01:44:27,396 --> 01:44:29,190
You're not my daddy.

1210
01:44:29,607 --> 01:44:31,901
No. Put the gun down, son.

1211
01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:33,819
Where's my daddy?

1212
01:44:34,153 --> 01:44:35,529
He's dead, Danny.

1213
01:44:37,072 --> 01:44:38,491
- He killed him.
- Shut up.

1214
01:44:38,866 --> 01:44:39,867
Listen to me, Danny.

1215
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:41,368
You remember me, it's your Uncle John.

1216
01:44:41,452 --> 01:44:43,579
You trust me, don't you, Danny?

1217
01:44:43,913 --> 01:44:46,707
Look, Danny,
I'm gonna put my gun away, okay?

1218
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:47,958
Nice and slow.

1219
01:44:48,417 --> 01:44:49,835
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1220
01:44:51,587 --> 01:44:52,630
Shoot him, son.

1221
01:44:56,467 --> 01:44:58,093
Danny?

1222
01:44:59,595 --> 01:45:01,472
Is my daddy dead?

1223
01:45:09,104 --> 01:45:10,272
Is he?

1224
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,276
Is he?

1225
01:45:14,777 --> 01:45:16,487
Just put the gun down.

1226
01:45:17,613 --> 01:45:18,948
Please?

1227
01:45:22,201 --> 01:45:24,036
Now, just put the gun down.

1228
01:45:40,302 --> 01:45:41,929
Captain, arrest these men.

1229
01:45:42,012 --> 01:45:43,639
This man is a common criminal

1230
01:45:43,722 --> 01:45:45,391
trespassing on railway property.

1231
01:45:45,474 --> 01:45:47,393
Comanche never
raided any settlements.

1232
01:45:47,476 --> 01:45:49,603
They staged the attacks
so they could violate the treaty.

1233
01:45:49,687 --> 01:45:51,438
We've heard enough. Captain.

1234
01:45:51,522 --> 01:45:53,065
You represent
the United States government.

1235
01:45:53,148 --> 01:45:54,275
You do not work for this man!

1236
01:45:54,358 --> 01:45:56,402
- Captain!
- They started this war!

1237
01:45:56,485 --> 01:45:58,571
Well, if what you say is true,

1238
01:45:58,654 --> 01:46:01,323
that would mean
I attacked the Comanche for no reason.

1239
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:02,950
That's right, Captain.

1240
01:46:03,867 --> 01:46:06,203
Slaughter of the innocents.

1241
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:08,163
Their blood on your hands.

1242
01:46:09,665 --> 01:46:11,500
Tenfold.

1243
01:46:12,668 --> 01:46:14,878
Are you capable of that?

1244
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:24,680
Well, the way I see it,

1245
01:46:24,847 --> 01:46:27,683
these men are with the rail road.

1246
01:46:28,142 --> 01:46:29,852
So, the question is,

1247
01:46:31,562 --> 01:46:33,063
who the hell are you?

1248
01:46:51,957 --> 01:46:53,542
Clear the track, men!

1249
01:46:53,626 --> 01:46:55,169
Outta the way!

1250
01:47:10,225 --> 01:47:11,477
Going to pit!

1251
01:47:19,568 --> 01:47:20,736
My God!

1252
01:47:20,903 --> 01:47:22,696
Out here, it's just rock.

1253
01:47:22,863 --> 01:47:25,491
Put it on a train, it's priceless.

1254
01:47:25,657 --> 01:47:27,951
What could you buy with all of that?

1255
01:47:29,828 --> 01:47:31,080
A country, Captain.

1256
01:47:33,082 --> 01:47:34,625
A great country.

1257
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:37,086
For which our children will thank us.

1258
01:47:39,129 --> 01:47:42,466
Take her ahead!
Line her up!

1259
01:47:48,138 --> 01:47:49,223
You're lined up.

1260
01:47:52,643 --> 01:47:54,061
RAILWAYMAN 22 That'll do!

1261
01:47:55,687 --> 01:47:57,731
Get these Chinamen out of here!

1262
01:47:57,898 --> 01:47:59,566
Move it, move it!

1263
01:48:00,442 --> 01:48:02,778
Detail, halt!

1264
01:48:05,364 --> 01:48:07,241
Order, up!

1265
01:48:17,459 --> 01:48:19,294
Didn't you hear me, Chinaman?

1266
01:48:19,545 --> 01:48:21,547
I said, get out!

1267
01:48:24,174 --> 01:48:25,592
Port arms!

1268
01:48:28,971 --> 01:48:31,223
Please, don't do this.

1269
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:39,106
You'll take care of us, like you said.

1270
01:48:40,649 --> 01:48:42,234
You don't have to do this.

1271
01:48:43,193 --> 01:48:44,820
Load!

1272
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,161
I ain't gonna tell you again!

1273
01:48:58,167 --> 01:48:59,418
What the hell is that?

1274
01:49:04,381 --> 01:49:07,259
Gas. That's gas!

1275
01:49:07,342 --> 01:49:08,510
What'd he say?

1276
01:49:08,594 --> 01:49:09,845
Gas! Get out of there!

1277
01:49:10,345 --> 01:49:11,597
She's going to blow!

1278
01:49:17,853 --> 01:49:19,188
Shoulder arms!

1279
01:49:21,106 --> 01:49:22,691
I was at Gettysburg.

1280
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,069
Twelve-thousand casualties
before lunch.

1281
01:49:27,196 --> 01:49:29,490
Know what I learned in all that carnage?

1282
01:49:29,656 --> 01:49:33,577
Nothing is accomplished
without sacrifice.

1283
01:49:37,706 --> 01:49:39,666
- Leave her alone!
- Danny!

1284
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:42,211
Nice and easy!

1285
01:49:42,294 --> 01:49:44,463
Gas! Oh, Lord! Gas!

1286
01:49:44,546 --> 01:49:45,547
What the hell?

1287
01:49:45,631 --> 01:49:47,007
Gas! Gas! Gas!

1288
01:49:48,842 --> 01:49:50,511
Ready!

1289
01:49:50,844 --> 01:49:52,888
I'm gonna have to
teach you about respect, aren't I, son?

1290
01:49:52,971 --> 01:49:53,972
No!

1291
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:56,809
Aim!

1292
01:50:00,562 --> 01:50:01,688
Fire!

1293
01:50:03,315 --> 01:50:04,316
Oh!

1294
01:50:12,991 --> 01:50:14,243
What the hell just happened?

1295
01:50:53,782 --> 01:50:55,576
Get the train moving!

1296
01:51:00,205 --> 01:51:03,542
Attack!
Maintain order! To arms!

1297
01:51:03,625 --> 01:51:05,085
Hold on, kemosabe.

1298
01:51:05,627 --> 01:51:06,628
Tonto?

1299
01:51:09,298 --> 01:51:10,632
What was that?

1300
01:51:10,799 --> 01:51:12,134
No reason for concern.

1301
01:51:12,259 --> 01:51:14,136
Over here! To the guns!

1302
01:51:14,553 --> 01:51:16,555
Defensive position!

1303
01:51:17,306 --> 01:51:18,307
John!

1304
01:51:19,224 --> 01:51:21,268
Rebecca! I'm coming for you!

1305
01:51:21,351 --> 01:51:22,477
John!

1306
01:51:22,561 --> 01:51:24,062
Rally on me!

1307
01:51:35,574 --> 01:51:36,742
Lord, save us.

1308
01:51:41,496 --> 01:51:43,415
Faster! Now!

1309
01:51:45,167 --> 01:51:47,127
Form a firing line!

1310
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,795
Come this way. Fall in on me.

1311
01:51:52,132 --> 01:51:53,800
Hold your positions, gentlemen!

1312
01:51:55,636 --> 01:51:56,929
Hold!

1313
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:59,640
Steady!

1314
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:03,101
For God!

1315
01:52:04,561 --> 01:52:06,229
And for country!

1316
01:52:09,733 --> 01:52:10,943
Fire at Will!

1317
01:52:15,364 --> 01:52:18,158
Tonto? What is that?

1318
01:52:27,626 --> 01:52:29,628
Now... must to jump!

1319
01:52:30,128 --> 01:52:31,129
Left or right?

1320
01:52:31,213 --> 01:52:32,381
Yes!

1321
01:52:50,148 --> 01:52:51,900
Kerosene?

1322
01:52:52,067 --> 01:52:54,444
What are you trying to do?
Blow up the whole mountain?

1323
01:52:54,611 --> 01:52:58,907
Trust me. These two have
a hard time staying dead.

1324
01:53:20,137 --> 01:53:21,388
Cover the flank!

1325
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:03,657
Mister Tonto?

1326
01:55:06,576 --> 01:55:07,994
Mister Tonto?

1327
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:11,456
You mean, they killed all of them?

1328
01:55:12,499 --> 01:55:15,627
The Indians, the settlers...

1329
01:55:16,253 --> 01:55:17,379
Dan?

1330
01:55:18,004 --> 01:55:19,131
For silver?

1331
01:55:23,969 --> 01:55:25,846
You were right.

1332
01:55:26,221 --> 01:55:28,098
There is no justice.

1333
01:55:29,057 --> 01:55:31,476
Cole controls everything.

1334
01:55:32,144 --> 01:55:35,397
The rail road, the Cavalry,

1335
01:55:36,481 --> 01:55:37,816
everything.

1336
01:55:40,694 --> 01:55:43,363
If men like him represent the law,

1337
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:45,699
I'd rather be an outlaw.

1338
01:55:48,869 --> 01:55:50,537
That is why

1339
01:55:51,663 --> 01:55:53,456
you wear the mask.

1340
01:56:11,766 --> 01:56:15,145
Something very wrong with that horse.

1341
01:56:26,156 --> 01:56:27,824
Ladies and gentlemen,

1342
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:30,535
we are here today to celebrate a dream.

1343
01:56:31,161 --> 01:56:33,330
And now I'd like to introduce the man

1344
01:56:33,496 --> 01:56:35,290
who made that dream a reality.

1345
01:56:35,457 --> 01:56:37,083
Chairman of the Transcontinental

1346
01:56:37,167 --> 01:56:39,127
Railroad Corporation,

1347
01:56:39,211 --> 01:56:40,587
Mr Lewis Habberman the Third.

1348
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,963
Thank you!

1349
01:56:42,297 --> 01:56:45,300
But I cannot take credit alone.

1350
01:56:45,508 --> 01:56:46,635
No, sir.

1351
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:50,680
The working men before you
deserve your applause!

1352
01:56:50,805 --> 01:56:52,224
Yes!

1353
01:56:52,974 --> 01:56:56,478
As does one man in particular,

1354
01:56:56,561 --> 01:57:00,565
and a more dedicated, loyal employee

1355
01:57:00,649 --> 01:57:02,943
the rail road could not ask for,

1356
01:57:03,026 --> 01:57:04,402
Mr Latham Cole!

1357
01:57:07,239 --> 01:57:08,990
- Come on.
- Good man.

1358
01:57:09,574 --> 01:57:10,575
Bravo, sir.

1359
01:57:11,242 --> 01:57:12,661
Mr Cole!

1360
01:57:13,495 --> 01:57:16,498
A testament of our thanks.

1361
01:57:21,544 --> 01:57:22,671
Cheers!

1362
01:58:01,543 --> 01:58:03,253
You missed something.

1363
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:05,046
Where did you get the explosives?

1364
01:58:06,214 --> 01:58:07,882
I told you.

1365
01:58:08,508 --> 01:58:09,551
No, you didn't.

1366
01:58:11,594 --> 01:58:15,223
But you had a plan. I mean,
he didn't get away with it?

1367
01:58:15,557 --> 01:58:17,225
We had plan.

1368
01:58:20,186 --> 01:58:22,230
It was good plan.

1369
01:58:26,568 --> 01:58:27,944
This is a damn bank robbery!

1370
01:58:40,457 --> 01:58:42,208
Oh, Mr Habberman,

1371
01:58:42,292 --> 01:58:43,418
if you and the other shareholders

1372
01:58:43,543 --> 01:58:44,502
would like to follow me,

1373
01:58:44,586 --> 01:58:45,962
I have a little surprise for you.

1374
01:58:46,087 --> 01:58:47,213
Ah!

1375
01:58:51,801 --> 01:58:52,927
Oh, my.

1376
01:58:55,555 --> 01:58:56,973
What was that?

1377
01:58:57,140 --> 01:59:00,393
Tunnelling for supply routes.
Nothing to be concerned about.

1378
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,103
This way, gentlemen.

1379
01:59:05,065 --> 01:59:06,608
Bring the girl.

1380
01:59:16,326 --> 01:59:17,619
He's coming for you.

1381
01:59:17,952 --> 01:59:19,788
Just like Frank said.

1382
01:59:20,622 --> 01:59:22,248
What you got makes them Reid boys

1383
01:59:22,332 --> 01:59:24,125
so hot under the collar, anyway?

1384
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:28,296
Maybe I'll have a taste and find out.

1385
01:59:28,463 --> 01:59:30,340
The men around this table represent

1386
01:59:30,465 --> 01:59:32,425
the finest families in our country

1387
01:59:32,509 --> 01:59:33,968
as well as controlling interest

1388
01:59:34,094 --> 01:59:36,346
in the Transcontinental
Railway Corporation.

1389
01:59:36,513 --> 01:59:38,139
Hear, hear!

1390
01:59:38,306 --> 01:59:39,390
What you cannot know

1391
01:59:39,474 --> 01:59:40,809
is that over the past six months,

1392
01:59:40,892 --> 01:59:42,310
I have leveraged a position

1393
01:59:42,435 --> 01:59:44,646
which will make me
the majority shareholder

1394
01:59:44,729 --> 01:59:47,649
when this company is
listed Monday morning

1395
01:59:47,774 --> 01:59:50,318
on the New York City Stock Exchange.

1396
01:59:50,485 --> 01:59:53,571
In essence, gentlemen, you work for me.

1397
01:59:53,655 --> 01:59:55,573
Have you lost your mind?

1398
01:59:55,657 --> 01:59:56,908
Do you have any idea the cost?

1399
01:59:57,242 --> 01:59:59,244
Each one of those freight cars contains

1400
01:59:59,327 --> 02:00:01,413
4.5 tons of purest raw silver.

1401
02:00:01,496 --> 02:00:03,498
When it reaches the bank
in San Francisco,

1402
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:05,500
that's 65 million dollars.

1403
02:00:05,667 --> 02:00:07,836
It's what you might call
a hostile takeover.

1404
02:00:08,169 --> 02:00:10,588
You can keep the watch.

1405
02:00:16,886 --> 02:00:19,013
Have you checked the undercarriage?

1406
02:00:19,889 --> 02:00:21,850
- Check it again.
- Yes, sir.

1407
02:00:26,604 --> 02:00:28,481
Pleasure to see you, Red!

1408
02:00:33,695 --> 02:00:34,737
Oh!

1409
02:00:34,821 --> 02:00:37,365
May I be of some
assistance to you, madam?

1410
02:00:37,532 --> 02:00:39,951
Seems I have a run in my stocking.

1411
02:00:41,703 --> 02:00:43,413
Ivory.

1412
02:00:52,589 --> 02:00:53,673
Hurry up with them grapes.

1413
02:00:55,049 --> 02:00:56,092
Shh!

1414
02:00:58,928 --> 02:01:00,597
Make trade.

1415
02:01:05,935 --> 02:01:07,061
Hey, boy!

1416
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:10,440
Boy, I'm talking to you!

1417
02:01:13,818 --> 02:01:15,570
Hey! You can't leave that here!

1418
02:01:15,737 --> 02:01:19,073
Mr Cole's pickles. Take it up with him.

1419
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,242
This is an outrage!

1420
02:01:21,409 --> 02:01:23,661
I, for one, am not gonna sit here

1421
02:01:23,745 --> 02:01:25,914
and negotiate with one of my employees.

1422
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:28,082
Then, let's get down to it, shall we?

1423
02:01:33,755 --> 02:01:34,714
My gluteus!

1424
02:01:34,797 --> 02:01:37,008
Gentlemen, our chairman
has had to take

1425
02:01:37,091 --> 02:01:39,135
a sudden leave of absence.

1426
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,929
Any nominations?

1427
02:01:43,806 --> 02:01:47,644
I nominate Mr Latham Cole.

1428
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:49,020
I accept

1429
02:02:01,824 --> 02:02:02,992
It's magnificent.

1430
02:02:04,077 --> 02:02:05,119
So clean.

1431
02:02:05,286 --> 02:02:06,621
You want to touch it?

1432
02:02:07,622 --> 02:02:08,748
Oh, yes.

1433
02:02:12,502 --> 02:02:13,962
Attention!

1434
02:02:14,254 --> 02:02:15,296
About face!

1435
02:02:16,464 --> 02:02:18,424
Everyone wants to touch it.

1436
02:02:25,723 --> 02:02:27,725
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1437
02:02:27,809 --> 02:02:28,810
Robbery.

1438
02:02:28,977 --> 02:02:30,770
We don't have no money here, boy.

1439
02:02:33,314 --> 02:02:34,983
Train robbery.

1440
02:02:35,149 --> 02:02:36,609
A little higher.

1441
02:02:36,776 --> 02:02:38,444
How high does it go?

1442
02:02:38,611 --> 02:02:39,821
Almost there.

1443
02:02:40,613 --> 02:02:45,201
...land of the free

1444
02:02:45,994 --> 02:02:52,417
and the home of the brave

1445
02:03:01,926 --> 02:03:02,927
Um...

1446
02:03:03,011 --> 02:03:04,512
Mr Cole?

1447
02:03:05,430 --> 02:03:07,015
They're stealing my train.

1448
02:03:07,849 --> 02:03:09,642
Get the horses!

1449
02:03:09,809 --> 02:03:11,019
Right

1450
02:03:12,854 --> 02:03:13,855
there!

1451
02:03:23,698 --> 02:03:25,533
What are you waiting for? To the engine!

1452
02:03:27,285 --> 02:03:29,287
Stop that train!

1453
02:03:35,501 --> 02:03:36,878
Shoot him, you idiot.

1454
02:03:37,378 --> 02:03:38,796
- No, Danny's in there!
- That's an order!

1455
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,881
Mama!

1456
02:03:46,888 --> 02:03:48,222
I've been shot!

1457
02:03:48,723 --> 02:03:50,391
There he is, men!

1458
02:04:08,826 --> 02:04:10,328
John!

1459
02:04:17,835 --> 02:04:19,003
John!

1460
02:04:32,934 --> 02:04:34,102
Come on!

1461
02:05:00,753 --> 02:05:02,422
Get me close!

1462
02:06:04,817 --> 02:06:07,111
The Ranger! He's on the roof!

1463
02:06:10,323 --> 02:06:13,367
How many times
do I have to tell you to kill that Ranger?

1464
02:06:14,035 --> 02:06:15,661
I told you he'd come.

1465
02:06:37,892 --> 02:06:39,727
Adios, Counsellor!

1466
02:06:41,562 --> 02:06:42,647
John!

1467
02:07:12,593 --> 02:07:14,720
Dance, monkey! Dance!

1468
02:07:15,388 --> 02:07:16,722
Oh! Ooh!

1469
02:07:24,855 --> 02:07:25,898
Danny!

1470
02:08:24,749 --> 02:08:26,334
Butch Cavendish!

1471
02:08:28,669 --> 02:08:30,087
Let her go!

1472
02:08:30,421 --> 02:08:31,797
If you insist.

1473
02:08:35,343 --> 02:08:36,344
Go ahead.

1474
02:08:37,637 --> 02:08:38,638
John?

1475
02:08:39,347 --> 02:08:41,015
She tends to land on her feet.

1476
02:08:41,349 --> 02:08:42,433
John!

1477
02:08:43,851 --> 02:08:45,019
Oh!

1478
02:08:48,314 --> 02:08:49,649
What you gonna do, Counsellor?

1479
02:08:50,483 --> 02:08:52,193
Shoot me?

1480
02:08:54,111 --> 02:08:55,112
That's right.

1481
02:09:00,534 --> 02:09:02,870
Guess I cut out
the wrong brother's heart.

1482
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:09,710
Don't tell me.
You boxed in law school.

1483
02:09:12,713 --> 02:09:13,881
What the hell?

1484
02:09:17,134 --> 02:09:19,011
As a matter of fact, I did.

1485
02:10:07,768 --> 02:10:08,769
Where is girl?

1486
02:10:09,061 --> 02:10:11,188
What? Where's the silver?

1487
02:10:13,858 --> 02:10:15,526
What are you...

1488
02:10:40,217 --> 02:10:41,802
End of the line.

1489
02:10:43,763 --> 02:10:45,723
We've been here before, haven't we?

1490
02:10:46,307 --> 02:10:47,725
Easy.

1491
02:10:55,441 --> 02:10:57,818
Where did you say
that train was headed?

1492
02:10:57,985 --> 02:10:59,653
The future?

1493
02:11:02,782 --> 02:11:06,118
Well, this here train,
she going straight to hell.

1494
02:11:16,962 --> 02:11:19,090
You know something, Butch?
I believe you're right.

1495
02:11:22,426 --> 02:11:23,511
Enjoy the ride!

1496
02:11:32,478 --> 02:11:33,521
Huh?

1497
02:11:49,829 --> 02:11:50,830
Hey!

1498
02:11:53,332 --> 02:11:54,375
Wrong brother?

1499
02:11:54,750 --> 02:11:56,043
Not today.

1500
02:12:27,283 --> 02:12:28,576
Time's up, Indian.

1501
02:12:30,911 --> 02:12:31,954
Uncle John!

1502
02:12:47,261 --> 02:12:50,389
Pretty soon, no one will even know
you people were here.

1503
02:12:50,764 --> 02:12:52,933
I'm a Spirit Walker.

1504
02:12:54,226 --> 02:12:55,769
I can't miss.

1505
02:13:08,782 --> 02:13:09,825
All these years,

1506
02:13:09,992 --> 02:13:12,745
I think you are windigo.

1507
02:13:13,245 --> 02:13:14,246
But, no.

1508
02:13:16,624 --> 02:13:18,667
You are just another white man.

1509
02:13:20,127 --> 02:13:21,295
Who are you?

1510
02:13:24,798 --> 02:13:26,091
Bad trade.

1511
02:13:38,187 --> 02:13:39,772
You let him get away?

1512
02:13:40,981 --> 02:13:42,107
No.

1513
02:13:44,652 --> 02:13:46,487
The bridge.

1514
02:13:48,155 --> 02:13:49,823
What bridge?

1515
02:13:59,708 --> 02:14:01,126
Oh, my.

1516
02:14:02,836 --> 02:14:04,505
"Bad trade."

1517
02:15:08,736 --> 02:15:11,030
Ladies and gentlemen,

1518
02:15:11,196 --> 02:15:14,408
as Chairman of the
Transcontinental Railroad,

1519
02:15:14,575 --> 02:15:16,744
I'd like to express our gratitude

1520
02:15:16,869 --> 02:15:19,246
to this masked man,

1521
02:15:19,413 --> 02:15:23,125
this Lone Ranger.

1522
02:15:23,292 --> 02:15:24,752
Hear, hear.

1523
02:15:25,919 --> 02:15:27,254
Come on, come on.

1524
02:15:28,714 --> 02:15:32,259
A small token of our thanks.

1525
02:15:36,555 --> 02:15:38,348
There will be plenty more
where that came from.

1526
02:15:40,684 --> 02:15:44,605
Always nice to have a lawman
on the side of progress.

1527
02:15:49,526 --> 02:15:51,862
Time to take off the mask, son.

1528
02:16:00,871 --> 02:16:01,955
Not yet.

1529
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:25,771
I can't stay.

1530
02:16:27,731 --> 02:16:28,982
I know.

1531
02:16:31,235 --> 02:16:33,237
But if that badge
ever starts to weigh on you,

1532
02:16:35,572 --> 02:16:38,909
well, you know where to find us.

1533
02:16:39,451 --> 02:16:41,286
Train's headed west.

1534
02:16:42,162 --> 02:16:44,164
There's nothing
holding you here any more.

1535
02:16:45,666 --> 02:16:47,793
It's my home.

1536
02:16:54,758 --> 02:16:57,177
You're not a boy
any more, Danny.

1537
02:16:58,470 --> 02:17:01,014
Your daddy would be proud.

1538
02:17:02,516 --> 02:17:04,476
You take care of your mama.

1539
02:17:40,345 --> 02:17:42,389
I thought I'd call him Silver.

1540
02:17:43,765 --> 02:17:44,975
Silver?

1541
02:17:46,018 --> 02:17:47,811
It is a good name.

1542
02:17:49,855 --> 02:17:51,231
You know, it isn't really a trade

1543
02:17:51,315 --> 02:17:53,442
unless both parties agree.

1544
02:17:53,609 --> 02:17:56,695
Who would really trade
a watch for some bird seed?

1545
02:17:58,530 --> 02:18:02,534
Bird cannot tell time, kemosabe.

1546
02:18:06,413 --> 02:18:08,332
"Kemosabe." Yeah, about that.

1547
02:18:08,499 --> 02:18:10,125
Look, I was thinking,
if we're gonna be outlaws,

1548
02:18:10,292 --> 02:18:11,752
I'm gonna need a better name.

1549
02:18:11,919 --> 02:18:15,047
I was thinking, "The Mask of Justice."

1550
02:18:15,214 --> 02:18:16,423
No.

1551
02:18:16,882 --> 02:18:18,467
What about,
"The Lone Rider of..."

1552
02:18:18,550 --> 02:18:19,551
No.

1553
02:18:20,010 --> 02:18:22,095
Do you know
what "Tonto" means in Spanish?

1554
02:18:41,114 --> 02:18:43,116
I guess I should be heading home.

1555
02:18:44,451 --> 02:18:45,702
Home.

1556
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:51,625
It was nice to meet you, Mr Tonto.

1557
02:19:00,884 --> 02:19:03,220
So, the windigo.

1558
02:19:03,387 --> 02:19:05,055
Nature out of balance.

1559
02:19:05,222 --> 02:19:06,974
The masked man.

1560
02:19:08,308 --> 02:19:10,644
It's just a story, right?

1561
02:19:11,645 --> 02:19:14,147
I mean,
I know he's not real.

1562
02:19:15,065 --> 02:19:16,817
Was he?

1563
02:19:17,484 --> 02:19:20,654
Up to you, kemosabe.

1564
02:20:00,861 --> 02:20:03,363
Never take off the mask.

1565
02:20:05,574 --> 02:20:09,161
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!

1566
02:20:12,706 --> 02:20:15,000
Don't ever do that again.

1567
02:20:18,378 --> 02:20:20,172
Sorry.
