1
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,014
Daily Sentinel.

2
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,725
One minute, please.

3
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,439
The mayor doesn't want the article
to print until after the next quarter.

4
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,026
Tell the mayor I'm insulted.

5
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,613
I'd never jeopardize the journalistic
integrity of this newspaper...

6
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,158
for some rent-a-mayor's
political agenda.

7
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,367
Very well, Mr....

8
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,539
So, Britt.

9
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,959
Here we are again.

10
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,963
Sent home after another
schoolyard fight.

11
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,257
I know you miss your mother.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,050
So do l.

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,930
But l have to take care
of 750 employees...

14
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,725
and you have to
take care of yourself.

15
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:45,605
Still, that seems to be
asking too much.

16
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,399
I was trying to stop some bullies
and the guy hit me.

17
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,152
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,448
No! No!

19
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,788
Do you think it makes
me happy to do this?

20
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,623
- Yes!
- No, it doesn't.

21
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,794
But not a week goes by without you
finding yourself in trouble.

22
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,046
If you're doing this for attention...

23
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,548
you have all that l can
afford to give you.

24
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,509
And you're wasting my time.

25
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,585
Frank!

26
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,591
No, no. Not you.

27
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,978
Have a seat.

28
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,648
Either one.
They're both very comfortable.

29
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,239
So, what can l do for you?

30
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,407
As you know...

31
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,953
l've worked my entire life,
very hard, to achieve one goal.

32
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,622
And that goal...

33
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,000
which I have,
in fact, achieved...

34
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,045
was to be in charge of all the crime
in the city of Los Angeles.

35
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:35,381
Therefore...

36
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,301
the fact that you assume
that you can...

37
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,887
open this establishment
without my permission...

38
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,391
without payment, and sell narcotics
out of it, is completely unacceptable.

39
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,559
Really?

40
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,935
And, to be honest...

41
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,437
quite insulting.

42
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,065
Therefore, you must
sign over ownership...

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,942
of this establishment to me...

44
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,153
at which time,
you become my employees.

45
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,613
We're your employees?

46
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,156
Yeah. Or...

47
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,699
close down permanently.

48
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,200
Choice is yours.

49
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,578
Okay. How do l pronounce
your name?

50
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,580
Tchaikovsky?

51
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,040
Chudnofsky.

52
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,791
Char... Chudofsk...

53
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,251
Chowdofsky?

54
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,425
Chud-nof-sky.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,385
Chudnofsky?

56
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,388
All right.
Chudnofsky, kiss my ass.

57
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,059
Put your lips to my ass...

58
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,394
and kiss it. French kiss it.

59
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,688
Tickle it with your gray whiskers.

60
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,066
I got bittersweet news for you.

61
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,026
You're washed-up.

62
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,946
You're old. You're boring.
You're not scary.

63
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,864
You dress like shit.

64
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,117
It's over for you, okay?
That's the bitter news.

65
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,911
Now the sweet news is:

66
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,329
You can retire.

67
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,623
You can go play golf...

68
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,210
eat your dinners at 3:00
in the afternoon...

69
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:59,090
play with your grandkids,
drink Metamucil, old people shit.

70
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,509
Okay? Look at me.

71
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,387
I got a name people can say.

72
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,305
My name's Danny Clear.

73
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,349
I deal crystal meth.

74
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,477
People call me Crystal Clear.
It's easy.

75
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,271
Check out my kick-ass
hangout here.

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,149
I got shitloads of glass
everywhere.

77
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,693
I got a see-through piano.

78
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,903
Look at my boys.

79
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,905
They're pimped out.

80
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,407
We got Gucci...

81
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,908
Armani...

82
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,327
another Gucci, tailor-made.

83
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,124
This is what you need
to get to the top today.

84
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,750
Not hard work.

85
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,211
Not dressing like
Disco Santa Claus.

86
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,130
You need charisma.

87
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,756
You look like my Uncle Greg.

88
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,094
A very nice guy, but, you know,
he's a dentist.

89
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,472
Now consider this
your retirement letter.

90
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,309
It's over.

91
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,854
See your way out.

92
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,068
What, you truly
don't think I'm scary?

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,405
No.

94
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,536
Okay, okay, you're scary.

95
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,038
Shit, you're scary.

96
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,247
You just said l'm not.

97
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,832
No, no, you are. You are.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,625
What's a "Disco Santa"?

99
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,794
"A Disco Sa... "? l don't know.

100
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:19,962
Sorry.

101
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,464
It was just something stupid.

102
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,882
You said I'm boring.

103
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,010
My gun has two barrels.
That's not boring.

104
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,387
And it was very difficult to make.

105
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,182
Answer me!

106
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,433
What?

107
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,895
What could l do
to be more scary?

108
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,396
A better name?

109
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,314
Cooler name?

110
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,732
More color or something.

111
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,111
Maybe you could say
something to people...

112
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,988
before you kill them.
But not now.

113
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,949
It's hard to think with this
double-barrel in my face.

114
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,950
Sorry.

115
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,750
You've given me
a lot to think about.

116
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,799
You're not gonna kill me?
Oh, l get it.

117
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,302
You keep me alive
so l can spread your legend.

118
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,889
Okay, l'll do that, man.
I'll spread your legend.

119
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,933
Hey, you forgot your briefcase.

120
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,215
Let's get this party crazy!

121
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,509
Behold, my lady.

122
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,403
That's the good stuff.

123
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,198
Oh, man.

124
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,411
Good morning....

125
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,665
Ana Lee.

126
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,875
Ana Lee. That's what l meant.

127
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,586
Oh, shit.

128
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,968
Son. This what you want
from your life?

129
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,055
This....

130
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,225
This gives you
a sense of fulfillment?

131
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,520
Dad, I told you,
tomorrow l'm enrolling...

132
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,730
in lTT Technical Institute...

133
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,233
and l'm gonna fix computers
for a living, so...

134
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:11,777
I spend...

135
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,654
all night writing an editorial...

136
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,407
about the nausea this town
has come to inspire.

137
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,785
About the corruption, the violence
and the decadence...

138
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,705
that we've come to expect
as part of our daily life.

139
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,874
Then l have to turn the page...

140
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,169
and see my own son's
contribution...

141
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,963
to this mayhem.

142
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,801
Sweet! l'm in the paper?

143
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,469
Now, you may think you're...

144
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,679
humiliating me...

145
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,806
but you're humiliating yourself.

146
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,809
Sorry. lf you don't like it,
just ask them not to print it.

147
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:44,977
It's your newspaper.

148
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,438
I can't, because, unfortunately,
it's news.

149
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,897
That's a good point.

150
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,941
I kept myself out of
the papers for years.

151
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,985
Now do me a favor
and do the same.

152
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,320
And l told you...

153
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,406
stop taking girls
into my garage.

154
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,035
You do it again,
I'll change the lock.

155
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,497
- Okay, but can you sign this for me?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,088
"Never stop the partay."

157
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,571
Look at these.

158
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,367
My shoe.

159
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,160
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

160
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,412
I'm very uncomfortable.

161
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,624
Who is it?

162
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,460
Paparazzi in the house.

163
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,212
Change the channel.

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,923
I think we may have our
first visual on Britt Reid.

165
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,801
- Go, go, go! Go! Get in there!
- Lt's for me. Hello?

166
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,052
Get in there!

167
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,640
And how are you coping
with your father's death?

168
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:05,891
Give us some insight!

169
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,310
If you're just joining us...

170
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,979
James Reid has been found dead
from an allergic...

171
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,731
reaction to a bee sting...

172
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,775
leaving his son his media empire.

173
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,319
How are you coping
with your father's death?

174
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,971
It was during my
election campaign...

175
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,849
for district attorney
that I first met James Reid.

176
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,185
And it was immediately clear to me
that he was a man of...

177
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,146
infallible integrity.

178
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,108
He dedicated himself to this city
through his philanthropic endeavors...

179
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,527
and his newspaper,
The Daily Sentinel...

180
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,404
a shining beacon of truth.

181
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,449
He was our North Star.

182
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,325
He showed us the way.

183
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,537
Thank you, James.

184
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,136
Britt, your father was truly...

185
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,388
a great man.
When l started campaigning...

186
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,639
he gave me some...

187
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,725
The best businessman
I've ever known.

188
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,144
- He always came out on top.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,437
Britt?

190
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,398
Britt.

191
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,818
Hey. I'm so sorry for your loss.

192
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,362
I just wanted to say
that my father...

193
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,657
was a federal court judge,
so l think l know how it feels.

194
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:50,037
When he passed away,
I had some pretty big shoes to fill.

195
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,538
Just like you.

196
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,958
So if you ever need
somebody to talk to....

197
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,755
I mean, if you ever just want to grab
a drink, you want to get cheered up...

198
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,715
l'm around.

199
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,676
Okay, thanks, man.
I really appreciate...

200
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,345
- Lock it up.
- Yeah. Okay.

201
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,430
- Keep it tight.
- Cool.

202
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,944
This is your newspaper...

203
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,032
but the burden doesn't
have to fall on you alone.

204
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,373
I've been your father's...

205
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,459
most trusted colleague
for the past 45 years.

206
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,587
I'm gonna make sure
The Daily Sentinel...

207
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,090
stays on a path that
would make him proud.

208
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,349
So, what do you think
of all this?

209
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,561
I don't think anything, man.

210
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,356
I don't know a thing
about this newspaper.

211
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,484
I've never even read
a full edition of it.

212
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,237
You can do whatever the hell
you want with it.

213
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,739
I'm not the guy to run
The Sentinel.

214
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,546
Trying doesn't matter
when you always fail.

215
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,057
Where's my leaf?

216
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,485
Stupid bush.

217
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,825
Hello!

218
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,329
Who makes my coffee?!

219
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,665
Will someone explain to me why,
on the worst day of my life...

220
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,543
my coffee tastes like shit?!

221
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,879
Your coffee is normally
made by Kato.

222
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,797
Who the hell is that?

223
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,967
He works on your father's cars
and makes his coffee.

224
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,137
You fired him and everyone who
works for your father yesterday.

225
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,014
I want Kato here now!

226
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,947
You're Kato?

227
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,785
I thought your name was Henry.
I thought the pool guy was Kato.

228
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,286
I'm Kato.

229
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,374
I'm sorry to hear about your father.

230
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,335
He was a complex man.

231
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,297
Yeah.

232
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,551
I have two questions for you, Kato.
Then you can go home.

233
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,179
Why is it that my dad's mechanic
makes the coffee?

234
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,848
And why is it that without you,
the coffee tastes...

235
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,808
like crap?

236
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,768
I think it's easier if l show you.

237
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,939
Holy cow.

238
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,440
Where did you get that thing?

239
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,566
I made it.

240
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,567
Watch this.

241
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,777
You made that?

242
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,322
Sit with me, Kato.
Tell me your tale.

243
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,159
I was born in Shanghai.
You know Shanghai?

244
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,618
Love Japan.

245
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,121
My parents died when l was 4...

246
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,333
and until l was 12
I lived in an orphanage.

247
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,004
I'm sorry. My mom died
when l was young too.

248
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,174
What happened after that?

249
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,718
Then me and a few friends
ran away.

250
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,012
- Lived on the street.
- How'd you start...

251
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,556
- ...working for my dad?
- L work in a garage.

252
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,018
And one day your father came in
with a '65 Chrysler.

253
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,603
I know the car well.

254
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,815
He was so happy with my work
that he offered me a job.

255
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,358
I said yes.

256
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,652
The coffee.
How'd that come about?

257
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,362
He used to always say:

258
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,532
"No one could ever make me
a good cup of coffee."

259
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Good impression.

260
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,994
So l built him the coffee machine.

261
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,873
Well, you make one
damn fine cup of coffee, sir.

262
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,042
Wanna see something cool?

263
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,794
Yeah.

264
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,966
Not bad, man.

265
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,384
- You did that?
- Yep.

266
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,637
Industrial polycarbonate.

267
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,973
What the hell is industrial
polycarbonate?

268
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,351
It's the stuff...

269
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,728
they use to make shark tanks.

270
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,398
What are you doing?
Put that away. Are you crazy?

271
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,566
Come on.

272
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,193
Don't be a pussy.

273
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,403
Okay.

274
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,073
What are you gonna do?

275
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,662
Dude.

276
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,832
That was awesome. What is that stuff?
How does that wo...?

277
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,583
Whoa, what are you
gonna do now?

278
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,793
And....

279
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,257
That is some Ben-Hur shit, dude.

280
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,007
Yeah.

281
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,511
Your dad made me do this kind
of stuff over the last few years.

282
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,057
That is the balls.

283
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,938
Old man was getting
paranoid, huh?

284
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:50,856
You like that?

285
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,941
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

286
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,826
You drew all these?

287
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,953
This is awesome.

288
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,538
Kato, you are...

289
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,789
a really good drawer.

290
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,165
This is really impressive.

291
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,793
Thanks. That's the stuff
I would really like to do.

292
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,128
Holy...!

293
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,046
Kato, are you a pervert?

294
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,841
I wish I could draw stuff that sexy.

295
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,554
Beer?

296
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,806
Yeah, l'd love a beer. Sure.

297
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,612
Thank you.

298
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,079
Hey, Kato?

299
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,333
What did you think of my father?

300
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,626
He was fine.

301
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,837
Come on. Just tell me.

302
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,257
He was my boss.
Nobody loves their boss.

303
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,177
Don't sugarcoat this.
You're not going to offend me.

304
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,970
Just tell me, man to man.

305
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,641
He was a bit of a dick.

306
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,519
Yep.

307
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,358
You are...

308
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,526
Look at that.

309
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,654
I am genius.

310
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,322
- You are a genius.
- Yeah.

311
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,823
You're a mad genius.

312
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,283
I like classical music.

313
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,329
You're a genius who likes classical
music. You know what you are?

314
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,705
A human Swiss Army knife.

315
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,248
What's that mean?

316
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,751
It's a little thing,
you keep pulling out things.

317
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,212
When you think
there couldn't be any more...

318
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,297
a new cool thing comes out.
That's you.

319
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,715
You even dress like one.

320
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,676
Just need a little plus
on your chest.

321
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,886
- Let's drink more.
- Yeah, let's drink.

322
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,264
Yeah.

323
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,059
You're speaking Chinese.

324
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,186
Oh, shit. Sorry.

325
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,357
I spent three weeks making a new
bumper for his Rolls-Royce.

326
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,694
And the day after l finished,
he crashed it.

327
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,448
He actually said it was my fault.
He screamed at me.

328
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,575
That sounds like him.

329
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,246
Listen to this, here's another story
of the 1 0 million l have.

330
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,915
I'm young, there's a...

331
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,918
Guys are picking on a girl
in school, I try to stop it.

332
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,169
I get in trouble.

333
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,421
What does my dad do?

334
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,675
He takes my favorite toy, and he rips
the head off of it! Right in front of me.

335
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,218
He throws it in the garbage.

336
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,179
I was trying to help!
That's all l was trying to do!

337
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,682
You know, it's unbelievable.

338
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,895
He's an ass his entire life and then,
you know, they build him a statue.

339
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,439
I just don't think....

340
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,860
People are gonna look at it
and think he's great but he's not.

341
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,695
It's totally unfair.

342
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,197
There's no justice.

343
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,286
Well, Kato?

344
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,623
What do you say we get ourselves
some goddamn justice, huh?

345
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,083
You serious?

346
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,293
I'm totally serious.

347
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,046
Let's do something crazy, man.
Let's do something nuts!

348
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,756
Let's just do it.

349
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,757
Yeah!

350
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,309
Let's roll, Kato.

351
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,159
Do you think it makes me
happy to do this, Dad?

352
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,757
Come here.

353
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,429
I know what you mean.

354
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,352
Oh, this looks ominous.

355
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,022
Where you going, man?

356
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,785
Oh, shit. Oh, no.

357
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,792
What do I do? What do l do?

358
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,544
Oh, God.

359
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,839
Hey! Leave them alone!

360
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,882
Let's get him!

361
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,883
Oh, shit!

362
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,301
I made a mistake!

363
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,891
Shit.

364
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,854
Guys, seriously! That's messed up!

365
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,813
Seriously!

366
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,361
No!

367
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,405
Okay. Okay. No.

368
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,198
I'm gonna give him a root canal.

369
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,199
Just cut him.

370
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,368
Get off, man! That's enough!

371
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,370
Open wi...

372
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,250
- You're a dead man!
- Come on, let's go!

373
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,709
Britt! Behind you!

374
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,176
Eat shit!

375
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,473
Kato, wait up!

376
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,644
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

377
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,480
Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Wait!

378
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,692
- Go, go, go.
- L'm in! l'm in! l'm in!

379
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,614
Oh, God! That was crazy!
I can't believe that!

380
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,659
Holy shit! Oh, my God, Kato.

381
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,126
Shit. Pigs.

382
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,920
Oh, no. Oh, no.

383
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,588
Are you a good driver?

384
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,965
You kidding me?

385
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,175
When I was a kid,
me and some friends...

386
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,677
Kato, not now. Just drive.

387
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,886
Okay, okay.

388
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,184
Just act cool.

389
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,520
- What do I do?
- Just act casual.

390
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,729
Pull it over! Now!

391
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,274
What are you doing?

392
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,608
I'm trying to lose him.

393
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,401
I don't know!

394
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,486
Man, now we're in a car chase!

395
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,738
Here he comes!

396
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,910
Show me your hands!

397
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,961
He's trying to kill us!

398
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,546
Do the Ben-Hurshit!

399
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,048
The Ben-Hurshit!

400
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:26,561
Oh, no.

401
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:36,738
Damn it.

402
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,574
Kato...

403
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,828
l think this is the greatest
moment of my entire life.

404
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,872
I know. Mine too.

405
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,339
Yeah! We rule!

406
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,800
That was amazing!

407
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,560
We are awesome!

408
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,728
That was crazy!

409
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,814
How do you do that, dude?
You beat the crap out of those guys!

410
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,442
Where l grew up,
it was very dangerous.

411
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,403
I got in a lot of fights
when l was a kid.

412
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,864
But you knew where people
were without looking.

413
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,115
You were so fast.

414
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:25,453
When my heart starts pumping,
it's almost like time slows down.

415
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,705
It's unbelievable how cool we are!

416
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,208
Do you hear me, Dad? We did it!

417
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,793
That was amazing!

418
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,378
Kato, I'm serious.

419
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,633
I'm gonna get real with you,
so just go with this.

420
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,302
It might get weird and intimate...

421
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,887
but just accept me, okay?

422
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,558
What we did tonight was fantastic.
It was amazing.

423
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,479
We saved those people, man.
We saved their lives!

424
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,607
So here's what I'm saying.
We keep doing this.

425
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,901
You can beat the crap
out of a million dudes...

426
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,779
because you freeze time
when your heart starts pumping.

427
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,115
We do that every night,
I'm saying!

428
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,908
Kato? Kato?

429
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,789
We could be heroes

430
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,748
Hey, hey, hey.

431
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:11,833
Look, look.

432
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,252
We're on television!

433
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,587
We're on TV.

434
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,841
Look at me!

435
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,175
Where am l?

436
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,635
I don't know.

437
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,847
I'm too fast for TV.

438
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,515
Yes, exactly.

439
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,354
We saved those people and they
just talk about that stupid head.

440
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,691
How can we be heroes
if they think we're criminals?

441
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,527
The suspects are considered
armed and dangerous.

442
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,281
I am coming to you live from
Elysian Fields Cemetery....

443
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,032
Okay.

444
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,535
Think about this, Kato.

445
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:52,790
What is the one insanely stupid thing
every superhero has in common?

446
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,959
Tights?

447
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,169
No.

448
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,170
Cape?

449
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,546
No, Kato.

450
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:03,634
It's that everyone knows that they're
the good guy, the hero, you know?

451
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,721
All the bad guy has to do is
start capping innocent people...

452
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,390
and he's got the good guy
by the nuts.

453
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,642
It's in every movie,
it's in every comic book.

454
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,895
It's in everything. lt's so stupid.

455
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,563
But if the bad guy...

456
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,734
thought the good guy was also a bad
guy, he wouldn't be able to do that.

457
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,361
That's what we'll do differently.
We will...

458
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,654
pose as villains...

459
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,490
but we'll act like heroes.

460
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:29,869
But then the police and the bad guys
will both try to kill us.

461
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,163
We're dead already, Kato.

462
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,082
I mean, seriously, look at us.

463
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,960
We've both been completely
wasting our potential.

464
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,921
You a little bit more than me.

465
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,590
What do you want your
autobiography to be called?

466
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,676
Oil Changes and Cappuccinos?

467
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:51,098
Because I think Balls Deep
in Shit-Kicking Dudes by Kato...

468
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,351
is a much cooler-sounding book.

469
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,937
I would read that book,
and l don't read shit.

470
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,607
But when they adapted it into a movie,
I would see the shit out of it.

471
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,443
Kato, you should never make
coffee for anyone again.

472
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,945
It's a waste of your talent.

473
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,572
It's not dying that
you need to be afraid of.

474
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,450
It's never having lived
in the first place.

475
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,915
It did feel good
saving those people.

476
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,292
Well, technically, l saved them,
but you helped.

477
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,126
Whatever.

478
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,754
- Let's not get technical.
- But why would people...

479
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:24,799
take us serious? We're just
two guys who stole a head.

480
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,641
I know how to make them
take us seriously.

481
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,443
All right, gentlemen. Hear ye, hear ye.
Court is in session.

482
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,654
Let's talk shop, okay?

483
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:47,905
Shall we?

484
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,825
Who's this guy?

485
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,618
Who's your friend?

486
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,912
- He's my man.
- L'm not your man.

487
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,332
He's not my man.
No. He's not my man.

488
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,168
He's like, you know, he's like
"my man." He's my...

489
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,337
Not... We're plato... lt's plato...

490
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,631
We're platonic friends.
Platonic male friends.

491
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:06,924
He's my...

492
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,135
executive associate.

493
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,847
Yes. That's who he is,
and that doesn't matter.

494
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,516
What does matter
is how we tackle...

495
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,143
this horrible incident.

496
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:20,813
Whoever did this means business,
and this is just the beginning.

497
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,275
What are you talking about?
You mean the vandalizing business?

498
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,610
I get it.

499
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,613
Listen, let's not blow this thing
out of proportion.

500
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,157
I will blow this guy
in any proportion l like.

501
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,199
This is my...

502
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,703
newspaper, Axford, and l want
this man on the front page of it.

503
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:39,373
I want him on the webpage.
I want you to blog about him.

504
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,876
I want him on every
news outlet we have.

505
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,502
I want the whole city to know...

506
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,379
how dangerous this man is.

507
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,298
The man that cut the head off...

508
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,176
of my father's statue. Not yours.

509
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,637
All right.

510
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,599
Since there isn't any real info
on the guy's identity...

511
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,560
what do we call him?

512
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,989
That's easy.

513
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,616
I got it.

514
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,411
This man is called...

515
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,914
the Green Bee.

516
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,504
It's kind of lame.

517
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,214
It sounds like a knitting store.

518
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,132
It sounds like an energy bar.

519
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,594
No, that came out wrong. That's not
what I meant. I didn't mean that!

520
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,554
I like The Decapitator.

521
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,307
Well, then make it like
the Green Desecrater.

522
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,184
What's the guy
that drives the horse?

523
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,519
Or Green Trenchcoat Guy.

524
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,895
The Green Hornet.

525
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:44,271
No. It's more like...

526
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,773
- What?
- What did...?

527
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,441
The Green Hornet.

528
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,444
That's pretty awesome.

529
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,612
Much better.

530
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,073
- You guys like that?
- Yeah, your man's right.

531
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,950
- Green Hornet it is.
- Looks good too.

532
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,036
- The Green Hornet. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

533
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,746
It's decided, then.

534
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,790
The front page of
tomorrow's newspaper...

535
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,293
will feature the Green Hornet.
Unless you like Green Bee better?

536
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,294
Anyone? No one?

537
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,587
Oh, that's much worse.

538
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,297
- Definitely Hornet.
- Okay, fine.

539
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,216
Let's roll, Kato.

540
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,804
So Green Hornet des... Oh, no, not
"desecrates." How about decapitates?

541
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,472
It's gonna be a long night.

542
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,157
I am.

543
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,787
We need to think of
a cool name for you.

544
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:42,997
The Lil' Stinger!

545
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm the Green Hornet,
you're Lil' Stinger!

546
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,250
No way.

547
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,502
The Honey Pot.

548
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,255
Get it? Like, bees make honey?
You're my Honey Pot.

549
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,341
What's going on?

550
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,099
Decapitated statues.
I decapitated real people.

551
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,185
No, no. I wouldn't worry about it.

552
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,604
He won't affect business.

553
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,315
I'm not worried.

554
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,026
Who told you l'm worried?

555
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,319
DA Scanlon!

556
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,530
With the nightclub bombing,
and now this Green Hornet guy...

557
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,366
some saying the streets
might not be as safe as you say.

558
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,370
Look, guys, stop connecting separate
thoughts with invisible lines.

559
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,123
This Green Hornet thing
is just a prank.

560
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,084
What you guys should report
is that since I took office...

561
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,379
crime is down significantly
in the city of Los Angeles.

562
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,714
Thank you.

563
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:03,994
- Hi.
- Hi.

564
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,663
I'm Lenore Case.

565
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,999
I'm the temp for Mr. Reid's
secretarial position.

566
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,543
Today's my first day.

567
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,338
Oh, nice to meet you. I'm Kato.

568
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,840
It's my first day too.

569
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,175
Really? Well, nice to meet you.

570
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,718
Do you work for Mr. Reid?

571
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,096
I'm his executive associate.

572
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,098
That must be great.

573
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,934
Yeah, it is. So far.

574
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,062
I have a really important question.

575
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,275
Who is the hottie-boom-bottie who's
standing right behind me right now?

576
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,236
I'm kidding. Hi, I'm Britt Reid.
I own this newspaper.

577
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,239
- What's going on?
- Lt's such a pleasure. I'm Lenore Case.

578
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,284
I've been sent to be your temp
until you find a new secretary.

579
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,121
Jackpot.

580
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,789
Right this way.

581
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,207
So...

582
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,126
got one.

583
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,460
Why don't you tell me:

584
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,298
How do you feel about
the state of this...

585
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,716
newspaper...

586
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,926
as it stands today.

587
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,303
Go.

588
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,139
To be honest,
this paper has taken a dip...

589
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,600
in the last few years
in quality and ambition.

590
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,559
Really?

591
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,394
Well, the entire industry has...

592
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,146
because of the lnternet.

593
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:15,649
So there's a lot of pressure to print
easy-to-digest articles.

594
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:16,775
And it's the last...

595
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,029
family-owned paper in the city,
one of the only not attached...

596
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,656
to a conglomerate,
so it's understandable.

597
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:23,616
Conglomerate?

598
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,160
The Sentinel used to really
use its independence...

599
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,953
to be brazen, at the very least.

600
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,831
Like that article your father wrote
just after the bombing?

601
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,501
That was reporting. That is the kind
of article that can make a difference.

602
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,839
That was good. You know
a lot about this shit, huh?

603
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,009
I studied journalism.
I have a minor in criminology.

604
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,677
- Really?
- Yeah.

605
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,639
Criminology.
The study of the criminal mind.

606
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,848
What are your...

607
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,976
thoughts on this
Green Hornet character? Go.

608
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,647
Well, first, there's two kinds
of criminals.

609
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,273
There's the psycho egomaniac...

610
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,691
and the power maniac.

611
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,276
He seems to be the second.

612
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,903
- English.
- He defied authority...

613
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,363
What will he do next?

614
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,114
Yeah.

615
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,951
What is his next move,
is what I was gonna ask.

616
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,494
Write this down.

617
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,038
Well, he'll probably try to...

618
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,373
appropriate more power.

619
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,708
He'll hit somebody
on their own turf.

620
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,379
Basically, he'll start out small, and
then he'll work his way up to the top.

621
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,382
I mean, that's what John Gotti did
to Paul Castellano in '85.

622
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,384
- And it worked?
- Yes.

623
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:25,719
Look at you!

624
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,805
You really know a lot
about this stuff.

625
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,807
And you're lovely
and beautiful and...

626
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,978
I'm just sitting here thinking, "Why
are you only pursuing this in your...?"

627
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,231
Kato, help me out here.

628
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,565
Twilight?

629
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,528
"Twilight"?

630
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,570
Yeah.

631
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,573
I saw the movie,
but I don't see how this is...

632
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,576
Oh, no, no, no. Not like that.
No. Not like the movie.

633
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,789
I guess if we're doing movies,
it would be more like Cocoon...

634
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,916
or something like that.

635
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,335
Yeah. Later in one's years.

636
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,087
What are you...? l'm only 36.

637
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,338
You're 36?

638
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,923
Holy shit. That's crazy.

639
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,842
Thought you were, like, 31, tops.

640
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,136
I don't even know if we
can hire a 36-year-old.

641
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,429
We have to build a ramp.

642
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:10,597
Why now?

643
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,099
She doesn't wanna tell you.

644
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,184
You don't know what
you're talking about.

645
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,436
Mr. Kato is right.

646
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,271
I do not feel comfortable.

647
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,442
And if this means l am not going to be
your temp any longer, I'm sorry. lt's...

648
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,235
That's exactly what it means.

649
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,447
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

650
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,700
Because you are now
my permanent secretary!

651
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,411
Here is what has
gone down, Lenore.

652
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,955
You've displayed two things.

653
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,123
Balls.

654
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,876
And if there's one thing
I like on my women...

655
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,961
it's balls.

656
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,296
Be my permanent secretary.

657
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,464
Are you kidding me?

658
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,299
I'm not kidding. This is how l do.

659
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,426
This is how l roll,
every day, all day.

660
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,636
I make it rain like this, okay?

661
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,055
Come work for me.

662
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,474
- Just say yes. Don't think.
- Really?

663
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,225
- l'll do it. Yes!
- Thank you. Yes!

664
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,144
- This is so exciting.
- Lt is exciting.

665
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,063
- Thank you so much.
- Don't thank him.

666
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,397
- Thank you.
- Yes.

667
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,983
- l will not disappoint you.
- L don't think you will.

668
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,236
I will do in-depth research,
fact checking, spell checking.

669
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,488
Anything that you need.

670
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,241
Why don't you get started on more
Green Hornet research? Perfect.

671
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,162
She is hot. lt's crazy how
hot she is. lt's sickening.

672
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,914
Did you write down everything?

673
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,123
Let me see!

674
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,125
Pervert.

675
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,836
Let's get to work, Kato.

676
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,423
All right, we got a plan.
Start small...

677
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,592
- ...work our way up to the top.
- Okay.

678
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,677
We'll need a car.

679
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,012
Yes, we'll need a car.

680
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,305
With some weapons.

681
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,099
And armor.

682
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,850
Cool rims. Spinning rims.

683
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,018
Slurpee machine.

684
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,770
A horn that plays "La Cucaracha."

685
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,688
Loaded up the ass with cool shit!

686
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,023
I can do that.

687
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,025
Kato, I want you to take my hand...

688
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,319
and come with me
on this adventure.

689
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,447
I'll go with you,
but I don't wanna touch you.

690
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,700
Don't take my hand, but will you
come with me on this adventure?

691
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,640
No.

692
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,486
I'll pick this one.

693
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,322
All right. This one.

694
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,492
Tell me what's going down, girl.

695
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,081
Hey, Kato!

696
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,499
Come closer.

697
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,376
I had an idea for the car.

698
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,587
Ejector seats.

699
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,088
Ejector seats?

700
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,048
You don't think it's a good idea?

701
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,094
- Hi.
- Hi.

702
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,425
I'm so excited right now.

703
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,469
I can't wait!

704
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,642
Oh, man. What the hell?

705
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,185
Watch your feet.

706
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,063
I call it the Black Beauty.

707
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,065
Kato!

708
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,400
It's beautiful!

709
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,320
And it's black.

710
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,698
Incredible.

711
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,833
Dude, we're forgetting
something important.

712
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,753
Watch this.

713
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,218
That is so wicked.

714
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,002
Where we going?

715
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,045
I have no idea. I thought you knew.

716
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,798
Oh, okay, l got an idea. Okay.

717
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,511
Mr. Reid's office.

718
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,388
I'm looking at you.

719
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,222
What?

720
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,390
I'm totally joking.

721
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,058
Britt Reid calling.

722
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:07,894
Burning the candle at both ends,
I see.

723
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,732
Wouldn't Mr. Case
be upset with that?

724
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,484
There is no Mr. Case?

725
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,403
Well, that's not why l'm calling.

726
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,073
Remember we asked you to do
all that Green Hornet research?

727
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,867
Predicting what he might do next?

728
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:24,077
If you could send us that?
Those crime maps.

729
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,246
- Oh, yeah.
- That'd be helpful. Fax it over.

730
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,414
Hold on a second.

731
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,374
Let me see.
It's coming right at you.

732
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:30,667
Great.

733
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,419
So, what you doing? Just...?

734
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,504
If you need anything else,
let me know.

735
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,214
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Bye-bye.

736
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,676
She wants me so bad...

737
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:40,594
it's crazy.

738
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,058
Here we go.

739
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,100
South Central.

740
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,769
Yeah. Okay. We got...

741
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,270
14 homicides...

742
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,398
34 assaults, 1 1 6 drug arrests.

743
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,733
This month.

744
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,527
A good place for
the Green Hornet to make his debut.

745
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,113
- Let's roll, Kato.
- Let's roll.

746
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,286
This is really far east.

747
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,413
I've never been to this part of town.

748
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,125
I think we're in the hood, Kato.

749
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,879
Britt, Britt! Do you think...

750
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,089
we start with them?

751
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,882
Yeah. Just like Lenore said.

752
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,134
Start small, work our way up.

753
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,969
This is really, really intense.

754
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,596
- You don't want to do it?
- L do.

755
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,765
Let's do it before
we chicken out, okay?

756
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,975
- l won't chicken out.
- Who knows who might?

757
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,143
Just pull up to them.

758
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,311
I don't want to talk.

759
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:34,064
- Well, l don't want to talk either.
- So get in the back!

760
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:37,150
- l barely speak English.
- You're speaking English now!

761
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,903
Okay, fine! Oh, this is so stupid.

762
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,071
Okay.

763
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,407
- Calm down.
- L am calm. This is scary.

764
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,659
- Shut up.
- You shut up. Just let me talk.

765
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,661
- Be cool, be cool.
- L am cool. Shut up.

766
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,998
Yo, you looking for
that good stuff, man?

767
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,918
I am the Green Hornet.

768
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,170
And l would like to sit
down with your boss.

769
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,338
Sit on this, bitch.

770
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:02,926
Oh, God!

771
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:04,886
My arm!

772
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,898
Bean bags! Kato, hit them
with the bean bags!

773
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,488
Yeah!

774
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,031
Let me show you how it's done!

775
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:27,492
Green...

776
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,702
Hornet...

777
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,911
says hello!

778
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,227
Eat my foot...

779
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,562
bitch!

780
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,898
My nuts!

781
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,240
What the hell was that?

782
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,995
Who do you work fo...?

783
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,538
Oh, God. Gross.

784
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,584
Who do you work for?

785
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,920
Shit. Hey! You!

786
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,421
Come here! Come here!

787
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:22,881
Hey! Who do you work for?

788
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:23,757
Chudnofsky.

789
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,217
Guy everybody works for.

790
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,051
Chov-what-sky?

791
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:27,177
Chudnofsky.

792
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,013
What kind of a dumb name is that?

793
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,766
- Where do you get the shit you sell?
- L won't tell you.

794
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,434
Oh, really? Never?

795
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,855
Chudnofsky's on our ass, guys.

796
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,774
We gotta get this shipment done.

797
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,617
You've just been stung!

798
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:51,993
Yeah!

799
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:52,994
You!

800
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,288
This is my town now!

801
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,791
My name is the Green Hornet.

802
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,126
Cool, man. Nice to meet you.

803
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,045
Cool. How's it going?

804
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,381
Anyway, tell your boss...

805
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,676
the Green Hornet
sends his regards.

806
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,677
Dude.

807
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,889
You broke my lab, man.

808
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:13,723
Yeah.

809
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,517
I'm sorry about that.

810
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,730
Let's burn this mother down, Kato.

811
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,375
Explain yourself, Mr. Tupper.

812
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:45,005
The guy was crazy, man. I mean,
he drove a car through a wall.

813
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,132
The thing looked like a half-tank.

814
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,050
There was fire
coming out of the thing.

815
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:50,510
And?

816
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,762
Oh, yeah, he gave me this.

817
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,017
He said that this is his town now.

818
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,355
A man comes in in an insect
costume and you shit your pants?

819
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,524
Look, trust me!

820
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,235
A grown man wearing a mask...

821
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,030
is a little bit scarier
than a guy wearing a suit.

822
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:21,082
You're not pleased with my suit?
Does it fail to fill you with fear?

823
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,463
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
any disrespect.

824
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,924
Do you have any idea how many great
people have killed in a suit?!

825
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,553
I like your suit.

826
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,721
Me too.

827
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:36,931
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

828
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,894
I'm not as scary as some idiot
in a green mask. Come on!

829
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,772
You say they won't affect business.

830
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,398
Now, this guy ran six...

831
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,442
of the biggest meth labs in L.A.

832
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,444
Now because of that Hornet,
he's dead.

833
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,155
Business affected.

834
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,241
I've got reports of the Green Hornet
shooting out a camera....

835
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,827
I had a report that
an elderly couple claims...

836
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,954
he gave the finger
from the HOV Lane.

837
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,166
That saw the Green Hornet
and his chauffeur in a fistfight...

838
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,752
with gang members
in South Central.

839
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,546
The Green Hornet raises questions.
We all know that...

840
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,965
gang proliferation
has been rising.

841
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,676
Okay, that'll be homework.

842
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,135
I got a yoga class.

843
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:18,264
Don't worry. Anyhoo, bottom line:
Headlines, people.

844
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,767
Get this story out there.

845
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,812
Will the violence continue
to spill out onto the street?

846
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,106
What are the police
doing about it?

847
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,358
Is anyone safe...

848
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,859
at the mercy of...

849
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,444
dot, dot, dot...

850
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,612
the Green Hornet?

851
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,323
And l want those dots.
I want dots in the paper, okay?

852
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,950
Want us to handle this delicately?

853
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,576
No.

854
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:42,414
But DA Scanlon's re-election platform
is based on cleaning up the streets.

855
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,040
You guys are acquaintances.

856
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,543
- So if you want us to...
- That's a great idea.

857
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,669
You should use that.

858
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,295
Write an article about that!

859
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:53,174
"Even DA Scanlon is quivering
at the feet of this scourge."

860
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:54,718
Use the word "scourge."

861
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,636
- Write an article about that.
- Britt.

862
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,638
- Can l talk to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

863
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:02,684
I know what you're trying to do, turn
this newspaper into a discotheque.

864
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:03,977
But it's not gonna work.

865
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,312
That's not what l'm doing.
She's a brainy broad.

866
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,022
This is a serious matter, okay?

867
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,191
Every line we print,
there's repercussions.

868
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,694
Somebody has to take
responsibility. That's me.

869
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:15,989
Well, l'm not afraid of these bastards
and you shouldn't be either.

870
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,907
Neither was Daniel.

871
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,325
He made it to the wall.

872
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,245
They killed him for wantonly
speculating on the drug war.

873
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,832
That's exactly what you and your
little girlfriend are doing.

874
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,334
I know you think my experience
ain't worth shit...

875
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,754
but your father listened to me.
So should you.

876
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,089
This is the story l want to run.

877
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:37,051
I'm going with it,
and if he were still with us, it's what...

878
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:41,264
Daniel Vertell.... Vertellah?

879
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,060
Vertalot. lt's what he would've
wanted too. Okay?

880
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:49,272
That's the story, team. Run it!

881
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,399
Britt Reid outro.

882
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,541
"Scourge"?

883
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,257
Tail on this Hornet guy!

884
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,201
Yeah!

885
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,577
Red light. Stop!

886
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,079
Shit, the camera got us.

887
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,253
What camera?

888
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,550
The Green Hornet
and his masked accomplice...

889
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,844
stirred up trouble in
the southland today.

890
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,304
Violence has erupted downtown....

891
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,601
- Kato? Breakfast in the house.
- Yes.

892
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,311
I just checked the Hornet mail.

893
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,814
Nothing new,
but they'll be a-knocking.

894
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:14,440
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

895
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,820
- l have something for you.
- Really? Awesome.

896
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:26,119
"Dear Britt, you are my shon-di."

897
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,120
What's shon-di?

898
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:28,288
Brother.

899
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,623
That's awfully nice.

900
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,502
I've never had a brother, man.
I always wanted one.

901
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,551
What the hell is this?

902
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,512
It's a gas gun. Your Hornet gun!

903
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,055
- A gas gun?
- Yeah.

904
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,349
Why not a "gun" gun?

905
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,976
Our enemies have "gun" guns.

906
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,312
What? l don't understand.
What are these?

907
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,981
What is this? What are these?
Are these paint balls?

908
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,150
No. Inside is knockout gas.

909
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,651
That's insane.

910
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,486
Where's yours? Do you have one?

911
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,156
- Do you have a black version of it?
- No, just you.

912
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,158
- No?
- No.

913
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,826
Well, why not? Why just me?

914
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,329
You are so special.

915
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,873
I know, but how come
I'm the only one with a gun?

916
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:12,916
You don't have...

917
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,877
much fighting experience,
so l thought you needed a gun.

918
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,547
Well, l'll be honest,
that's a little insulting, man.

919
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,549
We were both badasses
the other night.

920
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,677
I kicked that guy in the face
like three times. ln the face.

921
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,095
Yeah, yeah, l remember.

922
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,513
Yeah.

923
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,057
It makes you look cool.

924
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,184
I need to look cool now?
What the hell?

925
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,685
You said my outfit was pimp.

926
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,855
I thought, "That's a weird word."
But you said it was pimp.

927
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,357
- lt is pimp.
- Yeah.

928
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,525
The Hornet gun
is just an accessory.

929
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,693
- An accessory?
- Yeah.

930
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,905
Well, then you need
nunchucks, then.

931
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:47,116
- lf you don't like it, don't use it.
- How does it work?

932
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,534
Shit!

933
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,370
Hey.

934
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,205
Hey, hey, hey.

935
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,374
Okay. lt works.

936
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,051
What the hell?

937
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:08,304
Kato!

938
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,472
I'm here!

939
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,559
Hey, you're awake.

940
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,063
What the hell? What happened to me?
What's happening? What happened?

941
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,899
You shot yourself in the face
by mistake.

942
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,069
How long was I out?
What time is it?

943
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,487
Two o'clock.

944
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,489
Oh, that's not so bad, l guess.

945
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:28,741
On Thursday.

946
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,911
It's Thursday? Are you ki...?
It's not Monday right now?

947
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,121
No. I'm sorry.

948
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,296
Did you put this diaper on me?

949
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,928
Well, what did l miss?

950
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,096
Nothing really.

951
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,557
I did some work on
the Black Beauties.

952
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:53,766
"Beauties"?

953
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,436
Holy crap.

954
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,187
Backups.

955
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,690
How the hell did you do this
in four days?

956
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,400
It's been 1 1 days.

957
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,864
Whoa, 1 1 days? What?!
Are you kidding me?

958
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,616
I wasn't sleeping,
I was in a coma, dick!

959
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,119
But it's okay now,
I fixed the Hornet gas.

960
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,496
The gas only lasts one hour.

961
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,789
Can l see it?

962
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,791
Okay, but be careful
this time. Okay?

963
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,919
I just want to look at it.
Just give it to me for one second....

964
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,341
See you in an hour.

965
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,676
Mr. Reid!

966
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:29,802
Hey.

967
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,513
Welcome back. l'm so glad
you're feeling better.

968
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,515
I heard that mono was the worst.

969
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:35,808
Mono?

970
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,313
Yeah, well,
it's better than herpes, right?

971
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,483
Here are your messages.
I have some meetings...

972
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,651
- ...I'd like to set up with you.
- Cool.

973
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,986
Knock that off.

974
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,364
Here is the research that you
asked for before you got sick.

975
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,408
Green Hornet! Me likey!

976
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,661
DA Scanlon called, he said that
he really needs to speak to you.

977
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,454
Boring!

978
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,498
I need to go look at this stuff.

979
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,050
I read the article you sent me.

980
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:10,510
What are you doing tonight?

981
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,677
- Nothing.
- No?

982
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,720
Nothing at all.

983
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:16,682
Thought maybe we could get dinner
or get a drink, blow off some steam.

984
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,185
Yeah. l would love to.

985
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,521
- What time?
- L was thinking 7?

986
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,897
We could meet downstairs.

987
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,525
Seven.

988
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,780
- Perfect. l'll be there.
- Okay.

989
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,201
That was awesome!

990
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,245
Hey, Kato!

991
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,539
Can you make me some coffee?

992
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,877
You don't have your whole
little operation set up...

993
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,046
but whatever you whip up
would be great.

994
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,381
Lenore...

995
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,967
have you had this
little bastard's coffee?

996
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,009
Because it is...

997
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,345
scrump-diddly-umptious.
You want a cup?

998
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:55,471
I'm fine, thank you.

999
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,306
So that's just one...

1000
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,558
cup of coffee, Kato.

1001
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,895
So there's this restaurant that just
opened in the San Fernando Valley...

1002
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,941
and it's called
La Maison des la Voide.

1003
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,735
The whole thing is you eat
your meal in total darkness.

1004
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,070
So with deprived sight...

1005
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:14,323
each bite is like an orgasm
in your mouth.

1006
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,409
And l was thinking
maybe it would be...

1007
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,244
- Mr. Reid's office.
- ...fun if....

1008
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,788
This is DA Scanlon calling
for Britt Reid, please.

1009
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,915
Hello, sir.
I'm aware you've been calling.

1010
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,750
No, he's had mono.

1011
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,087
Let me look. Maybe there's a chance
we could work that out today.

1012
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,427
If you ever tell me
to get you coffee again...

1013
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,179
l'll beat the shit out of you!

1014
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,973
What are you...? What is wrong
with you? Are you crazy?

1015
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,809
This is our plan,
you're supposed to work for me!

1016
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,436
You got me a Jamba Juice!

1017
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:45,354
We're supposed to be
brothers, man.

1018
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,440
We're supposed to be shon-di!

1019
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,442
What happened to that, huh?

1020
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:50,776
I'm sorry.

1021
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,361
You should be sorry.

1022
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,781
We've become superheroes
and there's a lot of stress involved...

1023
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,075
but you don't gotta
freak out about it.

1024
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,119
Now can l have the coffee?

1025
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,580
I'm joking. I'm totally joking.

1026
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,498
You still mad at me, Kato?

1027
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,708
No.

1028
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:06,876
Good.

1029
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,794
Because you shouldn't be anyway.

1030
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,254
What's up with Lenore, man?

1031
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,006
Is she acting weird around me?

1032
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,299
No, why?

1033
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,467
I "like" like her.

1034
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,470
And l can't nail her.
She's completely un-nailable.

1035
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:20,139
It's a terrible fact.
I don't know what to do.

1036
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,808
She doesn't like you,
why would you want her?

1037
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,811
Maybe it's because she doesn't
like me. lsn't that sick?

1038
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,313
That could be it.

1039
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:31,484
Girls are such a drag, Kato.
Thank God we have each other.

1040
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:35,655
Hey! I'm calling a boys' night!
What do you say, huh?

1041
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,822
What are you doing?

1042
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,993
I didn't know you wanted to hang out.
I'm going for drinks with a friend.

1043
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,496
Friend? Who? Come on.

1044
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,248
Tony.

1045
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,499
Tony?

1046
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,710
Well, have fun!

1047
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,837
Hey, wait, wait, wait! Can l come?

1048
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:59,178
- You want to try?
- No.

1049
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,721
Hit the black key.

1050
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,515
- Really?
- Yeah.

1051
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,183
Okay, l'll try. Which one?

1052
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:19,240
You know, this Green Hornet thing
is just crazy, isn't it?

1053
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:21,575
I mean, it's all l can think about
sometimes.

1054
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:26,455
I feel really in tuned with it. Kind of
like that guy with the Zodiac Killer.

1055
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,708
What about the man
dressed in black?

1056
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,085
Johnny Cash?

1057
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,920
No. His partner.

1058
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:36,424
His partner. No, I don't think
that that's his partner.

1059
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,551
That's probably just
some thug he hired.

1060
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:41,053
Anyhow, they'll both
be dead in no time.

1061
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:42,722
Yeah.

1062
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,640
Why?

1063
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,893
Because the Green Hornet's been
attracting way too much attention.

1064
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,646
Whoever's in charge
is gonna get tired of it...

1065
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,065
call him in to make a deal,
then kill him.

1066
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,693
It's what Gotti did
to Mangela in '87.

1067
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,612
In two weeks. Two weeks, tops,
that's what l give them.

1068
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,072
- Two weeks?
- Dead.

1069
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,660
You're not gonna like this,
but we got nothing.

1070
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,079
It's like the Green Hornet
didn't exist.

1071
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,748
Nobody's done a deal with him...

1072
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,999
done time with him.

1073
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,250
Nobody's heard of him.

1074
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,252
It's like he came out of thin air.

1075
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,463
Yeah, and I've gotta say...

1076
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,466
he's setting a bad example
for the other gangs.

1077
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,343
I met with the Armenians today.

1078
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,346
They told me if the Hornet
is independent...

1079
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,806
they wanna be independent too.

1080
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,267
The Armenians truly said that?

1081
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,729
And l heard rumors the Koreans
are talking the same.

1082
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,147
Which Korean?

1083
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,774
Kim.

1084
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,611
Kim?

1085
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,198
No, Kim never said that.

1086
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:45,284
No, we've been doing business
for 25 years. We're friends.

1087
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,620
I'm sorry, boss.

1088
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,372
That's just shocking.

1089
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,124
Maybe we should go down there
and teach them...

1090
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,709
to keep their mouths shut.

1091
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:54,460
No.

1092
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,003
No. No.

1093
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:59,298
I should kill Kim myself.
He's a friend.

1094
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:03,219
And l'll kill the Armenians too.
It'll make me feel better.

1095
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,261
Wait! Wait!

1096
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,265
Great. What about The Hornet?

1097
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,565
Britt?

1098
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,485
What you doing here?

1099
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,196
Guess what, you son of a bitch.

1100
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,908
We got mail.

1101
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,328
We got Hornet mail!
He e-mailed! lt happened!

1102
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:32,706
Come here, look! Come here!
Look, look, look!

1103
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,584
"Green Hornet." Me.

1104
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,336
"Good job on the meth lab.

1105
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,881
The place was costing me money
and l wanted to shut it down."

1106
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:41,882
That's B.S.

1107
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,261
"Let's talk about another venture
that could be mutually beneficial.

1108
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:48,514
Please meet tomorrow
at the lot on Fifth and Union...

1109
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,808
in downtown at 4 p.m."

1110
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:53,936
Another adventure for
the Green Hornet...

1111
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,355
and his nameless sidekick!

1112
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,527
Looks like we've got
some planning to do.

1113
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,404
It could be a trap.

1114
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:06,866
Like how Gotti killed
Mangela in '87.

1115
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,201
Where did you hear that from?

1116
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,329
The History Channel.

1117
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:13,539
Oh, yeah?

1118
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,458
Should we go downtown now...

1119
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,792
and check it out?

1120
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,794
No, that's cool. l got that covered.

1121
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,088
You fill up the car
with weapons and stuff.

1122
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:25,342
So you're just gonna come up
with the plan by yourself?

1123
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,052
Bingo.

1124
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,597
I don't know if that's the best idea.

1125
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,474
- Course you don't.
- What's that mean?

1126
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,727
Oh, it means that you think
you're an awesome karate dude...

1127
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:37,813
that can do anything, and that
I'm an incompetent schmuck...

1128
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:40,399
who needs a gun
that shoots farts at people.

1129
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,485
I'm saying,
we should do this together.

1130
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,153
I'm saying you should go home.

1131
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:48,908
You should go to sleep so tomorrow
you could process my incredible plan.

1132
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:51,744
Fine.

1133
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,415
This is so stupid.

1134
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,584
We pissed this guy off.

1135
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,377
Now we're walking into his turf.

1136
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,880
We walked into their turf last time
and guess what.

1137
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,757
We kicked the crap out of them.

1138
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,843
And everyone knows: what happens
when you corner a hornet?

1139
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,094
You get stung.

1140
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,180
"You get stung."
What does that mean?

1141
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:14,725
This is not a game, Britt.
And you're gonna get us killed.

1142
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,437
If you don't like my plan,
you do not have to be a part of it.

1143
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,648
- l don't think you have a plan.
- L do!

1144
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,233
I just haven't told you yet.

1145
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,401
And it's amazing, okay?

1146
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,279
So are you in, or are you
chickening out like a bitch?

1147
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:28,614
You are a bitch.

1148
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,950
Not now, Kato, not now.
Turn in here.

1149
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,124
There they are.
Game faces, Kato. Game faces.

1150
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:43,420
Here's the plan.
Take this, put it in your ear.

1151
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,214
You listen in on my phone...

1152
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,882
which I've taped to my chest.

1153
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:50,261
When I say the secret word,
which is "Constantinople"...

1154
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,764
l'll kick the old guy in the nuts,
you blow them up with missiles.

1155
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,058
Truck! Kato, back up!

1156
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,309
Back up! Back up!

1157
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,978
Okay, okay, okay.

1158
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,481
This is not part of the plan!

1159
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:03,399
No shit!

1160
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:18,080
And so thunder strikes lightning.

1161
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,086
Okay, don't panic!

1162
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,173
The worst thing we can do
right now is panic.

1163
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,967
Just let me think.

1164
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,684
Okay, don't worry.
I'll get us out of here, okay?

1165
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:41,520
No, you won't! We're gonna
die now, you ass-wipe.

1166
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:44,189
Well, with that attitude we will!
Come on, man!

1167
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,113
- l think l'm claustrophobic!
- Let me think.

1168
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:51,822
Oh, no!

1169
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,241
- l can't breathe!
- Listen, listen.

1170
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,039
We're buried!
We are totally buried!

1171
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,957
Okay, okay.

1172
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,542
What are you doing?

1173
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:06,295
Either killing us or saving us.

1174
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,882
Missiles armed?
That's your plan? You'll blow us up.

1175
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,634
That's not a good plan!

1176
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,052
Disarm them, man!

1177
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:14,678
Shall we part?

1178
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,181
Feel like kebabs for dinner?

1179
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:23,979
Look out!

1180
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,194
Chili!

1181
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,405
They killed him! They killed Chili!

1182
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:43,874
Run!

1183
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,258
Oh, shit.

1184
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,302
- There's thorns in these bushes!
- Shut up!

1185
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:56,345
Shut up!

1186
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:00,849
This thing has no aim!

1187
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:01,934
It sucks!

1188
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:03,435
You have no aim!

1189
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:07,439
Britt!

1190
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:16,532
What?

1191
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,627
I smash window, you shoot in.

1192
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,629
Every man for himself!

1193
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,055
Go away!

1194
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,391
Die!

1195
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:43,726
Oh, shit!

1196
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,461
So you just gonna
ignore me now, is that it?

1197
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,129
Like a baby?

1198
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,965
And go home,
eat some baby food maybe?

1199
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,633
Drink some milk?

1200
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,262
Why don't you talk like a baby.
Mama, goo-goo. You baby.

1201
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,189
Baby.

1202
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,195
Explosives were triggered
from that vehicle, destroying it...

1203
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,122
- ...freeing the Green Hornet....
- Dickweed.

1204
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,825
You're calling me that too?
I know people call me that.

1205
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,994
That's not a surprise.
That's not a mystery.

1206
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,204
Why not?

1207
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:47,664
You say rude things to me
all day, every day.

1208
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,208
That's not how partners work.

1209
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,542
We're not partners.

1210
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,713
I'm the hero, you're my sidekick!
That's what this is.

1211
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,715
I'm lndy, you're Short Round!

1212
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:59,218
Simon, Garfunkel!

1213
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,720
Scooby, Doo!

1214
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,556
Stop fooling yourself.
Green Hornet is nothing without me.

1215
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:08,227
I made the knockout gas. l alone
designed and built the Black Beauty.

1216
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,521
And l didn't help at all?

1217
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,231
How? Ejector seats?

1218
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,524
Exactly.

1219
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,692
What a great idea.

1220
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,237
You may have started
this Green Hornet thing...

1221
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,239
because you hated your father.

1222
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:23,200
- You're an egomaniac.
- L know.

1223
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,911
Exactly like your father.

1224
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:30,666
You are a jealous,
pathetic little man!

1225
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:33,043
Fine. You're doing great
with Lenore.

1226
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:34,920
What the hell does that mean?

1227
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,339
Don't you walk away on that!

1228
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,925
What, you're charming her
pants off, that's what...

1229
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,426
l'm supposed to believe?

1230
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:44,930
No, that is a filthy gesture!

1231
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,181
You know I like her!

1232
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,933
I confided in you, Kato!

1233
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,269
I trusted you!
I told you l liked her!

1234
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,855
Stop it! You hit on
everything that moves.

1235
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,107
I'm amazed you haven't...

1236
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,400
hit on me yet.

1237
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,612
If you keep talking like this, Kato...

1238
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,614
l'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.

1239
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,534
- Just so you know.
- L'd like to see you try.

1240
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,077
You are a yuppie wimp...

1241
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:10,539
and l'm a martial arts expert who
grew up penniless on the streets.

1242
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:12,916
You grew up penis-less
on the streets.

1243
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,459
Funny!

1244
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,962
Heroes beat sidekicks, period!

1245
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,463
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

1246
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,798
I'm warning you.

1247
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,471
Okay, l'm gonna forget that slap...

1248
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,931
so we can fix this.

1249
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,309
Okay, okay, you're right.
You're right.

1250
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,936
Let's talk. I'm sorry.

1251
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,232
Sacked you like a bitch, Kato!

1252
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,031
Come here! Chop-chop!

1253
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:50,329
You like that, Kato? You like it?
This is what you get...

1254
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,414
when you corner a hornet!

1255
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,665
You get...

1256
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,167
Oh, God!

1257
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,425
Now I'm gonna hurt you.

1258
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,093
I'd like to see you try.

1259
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:11,934
Get this stupid thing off me...

1260
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,268
you cheating bastard!

1261
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,858
You dirty bastard!

1262
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:35,707
You idiot.

1263
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:37,501
Okay, let's...

1264
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:40,712
Can we end this?

1265
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,804
You are so stubborn.

1266
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,071
Do you like it? You like it?

1267
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,531
No, I don't like it!

1268
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:08,907
You like it? You like it?

1269
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:09,950
I don't like it.

1270
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,336
Okay. Now we can end this.

1271
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:23,839
Just stop. Just stop.

1272
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:26,091
Just stop! Stop!

1273
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,134
Stop, stop, stop!

1274
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:38,270
Britt!

1275
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,272
Help!

1276
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,619
Get out of my pool.

1277
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:57,622
Get off my property!

1278
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,458
You're fired!

1279
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,293
- Never come back!
- Help!

1280
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,422
I can't swim!

1281
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,930
Britt! Britt!

1282
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:39,998
Lenore, it's me.

1283
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,084
It's me, Kato.

1284
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,127
What the hell?

1285
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:46,630
- That's for whatever lie you told Britt.
- What?

1286
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:49,007
He called me a minx,
and then he fired me.

1287
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,679
Chili was a fine warrior.

1288
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,266
He was a man of honor and dignity.

1289
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,728
We must show our respect.

1290
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:04,523
And we must show it in blood.

1291
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,275
Popeye, go forth.

1292
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,112
Take these words
and spread them:

1293
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:13,615
The bounty, 1 million dollars.

1294
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,535
The prey, the Green Hornet.

1295
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,703
Dead, if possible.

1296
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,123
Alive, if necessary.

1297
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,001
I don't care whence they have to go,
or who they have to do.

1298
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:28,755
I want the head of the Green Hornet,
and l want it tonight!

1299
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:31,258
Find him. Kill him. Take him out.

1300
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,059
How do you do?

1301
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,687
Everybody, chase The Hornet!

1302
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:46,523
It's about The Hornet.
We want him dead.

1303
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:47,691
All right.

1304
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:49,860
Hey, you, do me a favor.

1305
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,571
Listen to me. He's got a mask on.

1306
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,240
I need you to spread the word,
all right? Kill him.

1307
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:56,908
The mask was green. Yeah.

1308
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,160
Yo.

1309
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,913
A green mask.

1310
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,416
A hit on The Hornet.
A million bucks.

1311
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:05,584
Good, good.

1312
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,586
What's going on?
What's the word?

1313
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,423
Listen, this Green Hornet.
He's got a mask on.

1314
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,383
One million dollar.
The Green Hornet.

1315
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,760
You got it. All right.

1316
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,095
Hey, Jacko!

1317
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:19,389
Hey, man, you wanna
make a few bucks?

1318
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,542
You failed to kill me
The Hornet, Popeye!

1319
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,761
I warned you about this.

1320
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:59,679
You heightened this
thing to a point...

1321
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,265
where it had to reach
some kind of a climax.

1322
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,643
Well, here it is.

1323
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:10,315
I hope you realize now that
you should stay out of my way.

1324
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,567
Let me run this paper.

1325
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:21,743
A gruesome scene last night as
bodies were found across the city...

1326
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,579
every one of them
wearing green clothing.

1327
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,335
DA Scanlon's office, please.

1328
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:33,213
The victims were unrelated
and authorities believe...

1329
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:34,965
their only connection was...

1330
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,426
their choice of attire.
As a precaution, police are advising...

1331
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,846
citizens to avoid wearing
the color green, so as not to be...

1332
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,807
unwittingly targeted.

1333
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,852
This is my fault. This is
what I did with this paper.

1334
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:48,853
So what?

1335
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,357
At least you tried. Your dad
would have understood that.

1336
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,859
Look, running a newspaper
must be difficult.

1337
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:58,571
I mean, if it's anything like running
a re-election campaign...

1338
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,615
it's gotta be a pain in the ass.

1339
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:05,787
Fortunately, l think we can
make each other's lives easier.

1340
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:07,831
How?

1341
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:09,708
There are two sides
to every story.

1342
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,877
I mean, some people,
they see an event and they...

1343
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,964
interpret it as this crime war,
you know?

1344
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,882
Other people see
the same incident...

1345
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,343
and they interpret it
as an isolated event.

1346
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,846
- Yeah.
- L guess I could...

1347
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:27,892
help you decide how
these incidents are exposed.

1348
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,811
In the public interest, of course.

1349
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:34,024
Now, if this collaboration
leads to assert my position...

1350
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,401
well, l will make sure that you...

1351
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,904
enjoy compensation in return.

1352
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,491
What kind of compensation?

1353
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:46,953
Frank, are you...?

1354
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,581
Are you saying you want me
to slant the news...

1355
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,000
for your re-election?
Is that what this is?

1356
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:53,543
I thought you needed my help.

1357
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:56,296
We help each other out...

1358
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,923
so that we can both get ahead.

1359
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,468
This is mutually beneficial.

1360
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,679
Okay, l get it now.

1361
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,349
You went to my dad,
he rejected your offer...

1362
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,559
and you think you can
push me around.

1363
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,561
That's what you think?

1364
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,480
No, what l think...

1365
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:17,192
is that you overvalue
your dad's integrity.

1366
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,988
You get out of my office
right this second.

1367
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:28,787
This might be
what you're looking for.

1368
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:29,996
Thank you.

1369
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,247
You're welcome.

1370
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,774
Stay here.

1371
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,946
Boss, what are you
doing up here?

1372
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:04,781
We were waiting for you down...

1373
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,157
Come here.

1374
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,828
I've been doing some thinking.

1375
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:12,455
And l had a revelation.

1376
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,416
Look, l'm obsolete.

1377
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,292
I'm a dinosaur.

1378
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,837
Not in the scary way,
in the extinct way.

1379
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,588
And it's time for changes.

1380
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,090
You know, it's time for me...

1381
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,383
to gain some...

1382
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,844
charisma.

1383
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,930
I've no idea what you're
talking about. I mean...

1384
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:33,351
I'm talking about a motif.
A theme.

1385
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,519
A mask.

1386
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,521
Perhaps a stylish cape.

1387
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:39,065
I'm talking about the death
of Chudnofsky...

1388
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:42,068
and the rebirth of Bloodnofsky.

1389
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,487
What do you say?

1390
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:47,574
Honestly?

1391
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,825
Yeah.

1392
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:53,788
I think that is the stupidest thing
I have ever heard.

1393
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:56,332
Why is that stupid?

1394
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,168
That's not stupid.

1395
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,712
Bloodnofsky.

1396
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,215
I was gonna wear red.

1397
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,176
For blood, get it?

1398
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,136
That's scary.

1399
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:09,888
And cool.

1400
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,514
Get this:

1401
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:16,478
"Be it my mask or your blood, red will
be the last color you'll ever see."

1402
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,732
I say that to people
when l kill them.

1403
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,901
The Green Hornet killed Chili.

1404
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,612
I am minus an eyeball here.

1405
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,656
You can't go and tell these
guys that, they'll think you've...

1406
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,158
lost your bloody mind.

1407
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,744
I think you're having
a midlife crisis here.

1408
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:34,829
Seriously, you're starting
to scare me.

1409
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,374
Want to know a secret?

1410
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,586
I'm starting to scare myself.

1411
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,594
Gentlemen...

1412
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:53,181
the reign of Bloodnofsky
starts tonight.

1413
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,898
- Hey. l'm sorry l fired you!
- Get out of here!

1414
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:04,108
I shouldn't have
called you a minx.

1415
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,777
Look, please, just listen to me.

1416
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,612
Kato lied about us, okay?

1417
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,073
You should have found that out
before you fire me.

1418
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,908
- Nothing happened?
- No.

1419
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:14,953
Oh, thank God! I knew it!
I knew nothing happened!

1420
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,622
- That ass. He said you did this.
- What?

1421
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,456
What is that?

1422
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,292
I don't know. lt's gross.
That's not why I'm here.

1423
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,127
I need you to come back and work.

1424
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,630
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll double your salary.

1425
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,550
Things at The Sentinel
Not what they seem.

1426
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,468
As soon as Scanlon
started running...

1427
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,555
my father stopped printing news
about hard crime.

1428
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,306
He was making Scanlon
look good.

1429
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,684
And l have to make it right.

1430
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:42,146
And l realized that if I want to do
what's best for this world...

1431
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,650
that The Daily Sentinel is the most
responsible way to do that.

1432
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,277
But here's the problem:

1433
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,653
I don't know...

1434
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,071
anything...

1435
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,198
- ...about journalism.
- That's the truth.

1436
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:54,659
Look, l need someone who does.

1437
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,829
I need someone who
I can trust with my life.

1438
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,247
I'm just... Okay?

1439
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:02,667
I need someone who is you.
I need you, Lenore.

1440
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:05,670
Will you please help me?

1441
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,924
Britt, I...

1442
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,343
I know, I know.

1443
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:14,429
Oh, my God!

1444
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,348
Oh, God.

1445
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,100
What is your problem?

1446
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,101
God.

1447
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,477
Why did you do that to me?

1448
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,979
Because you tried to kiss me!

1449
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:25,440
- Yeah, we were gonna make out.
- No, we weren't.

1450
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:28,693
Then l guess I owe you an apology,
because l misread that.

1451
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:29,861
As usual.

1452
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:33,448
Okay. Look, I'm sorry. l didn't plan
on kissing you when l said all that.

1453
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,617
Will you come back
and work for me, please?

1454
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:36,868
Pretty please?

1455
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:38,536
Double my salary.

1456
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,455
And l want a parking spot.

1457
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,874
You don't have a parking spot?
Oh, that sucks.

1458
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:46,210
And if you ever so much
as look at my ass again...

1459
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,378
I can't even see it.

1460
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,215
L will sue you for sexual harassment.
Do you understand?

1461
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:52,884
Hugs?

1462
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,136
Where my hugs at, y'all?

1463
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,417
- Britt Reid's office.
- Frank Scanlon.

1464
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:28,461
Please hold.

1465
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,421
DA Scanlon.

1466
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,006
- Really?
- Yes.

1467
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:33,800
Hello?

1468
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:35,927
Hey, Britt, it's Scanlon.

1469
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:39,097
Listen, l think l owe you
an apology.

1470
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:53,444
Too much blood in the gutter.
You win. Let's split L.A.

1471
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:56,948
You get the L. I get the A.
That means we share the gold...

1472
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,616
and the work.

1473
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:06,541
One million dollars for today.

1474
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,460
I think you misunderstood
where l was coming from...

1475
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,963
and l'd like a chance
to clarify some things.

1476
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:13,381
Things are pretty clear.

1477
01:24:13,549 --> 01:24:15,133
- l got three words for you:
- No.

1478
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,093
- Suck it, you dick face!
- Look.

1479
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,804
Tell him that you wanna meet him.
This is journalism.

1480
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:23,015
If you wanna be an investigative
reporter, you have to investigate.

1481
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,809
Tell him that you wanna meet him.

1482
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,979
- Might've gotten disconnected, Britt.
- You're right. Watch this.

1483
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:33,985
I was joking.

1484
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:36,821
Yeah, why don't we get together
and talk about things?

1485
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,156
That's a good idea. Okay?

1486
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,075
Let's meet for dinner.
A place called Gonpachi Hibachi.

1487
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,660
Little place on La Cienega.

1488
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,203
Around 8:30?

1489
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,126
La Cienega...

1490
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,210
8:30.

1491
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:31,834
Britt!

1492
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:43,888
Hey, Frank.

1493
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:44,931
Hey, Britt.

1494
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,098
Good to see you.

1495
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,059
I'm having a sake.
What are you having?

1496
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,560
Yeah, l'll have some sake.

1497
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,231
Thanks for coming.

1498
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:55,066
No problem.

1499
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,641
Mr. Chudnofsky?

1500
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,935
Bloodnofsky. Blood-nof-sky.

1501
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:34,313
I commissioned the Green Hornet.
You're the chauffeur.

1502
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,148
Partner.

1503
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,525
Where's The Hornet?

1504
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:39,485
Right there.

1505
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,781
Whoa, we only get half the team?

1506
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,324
Who says you're the good half?

1507
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:51,873
Where's Reid?

1508
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,207
Guess.

1509
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:59,297
Any of you move, you're dead.

1510
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,300
I'm not actually here
for forgiveness, Britt.

1511
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,509
I don't understand.

1512
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:05,136
You understand nothing...

1513
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,471
so l'm gonna explain it
to you very simply.

1514
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,975
If you ever come across any article
regarding a major crime...

1515
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:12,810
a man named
Benjamin Chudnofsky...

1516
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,271
or anything that makes
this city think...

1517
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:18,566
l am not the fine line protecting
the light from the darkness...

1518
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,192
you're gonna bring it to me.

1519
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,777
You're gonna bring it to me...

1520
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,113
and l'll tell you
if it's okay to print...

1521
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,324
in your stupid little newspaper.

1522
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,577
That's how l did it with your dad.

1523
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,705
And that's how you and l
are gonna do it.

1524
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,461
Scanlon, are you saying you want me
to let you write the news?

1525
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,342
Finally you understand.

1526
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:49,180
Yup. l understand, all right.

1527
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:50,723
Here's what l understand.

1528
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:54,018
That you, son, just got played...

1529
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,228
by a player.

1530
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,522
Recording device. USB.

1531
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,232
No, you can't have it, it's mine!

1532
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,318
You stupid schmuck!

1533
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:05,738
I got you by the balls, Scanlon.
I own a newspaper, genius.

1534
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,032
- This'll be front-page.
- L have to say...

1535
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,742
- ...I'm impressed.
- You should be.

1536
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,077
It won't do you any good.

1537
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,205
How could it not? Are you
gonna kill me in this restaurant?

1538
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:15,206
Yes.

1539
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,124
What, you're gonna murder me?

1540
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,002
Yeah. Like l murdered your father.

1541
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:23,756
I don't think so. My dad was not
murdered. He died of a bee sting.

1542
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,592
No, no, your father died of
an overdose of apitoxin...

1543
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:30,221
most commonly found in a bee sting,
which he happened to be allergic to.

1544
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:32,014
But that apitoxin...

1545
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,892
was administered by me.

1546
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,020
Shit!

1547
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:42,066
Think, Britt. You can figure this out,
my son, with your brains.

1548
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,819
It's almost like time slows down.

1549
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:48,489
That's right. Think. Slowly.

1550
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,409
Okay, two years ago,
Scanlon decides to run for DA.

1551
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,911
He says he's cleaning up
the streets of L.A...

1552
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,621
which is impossible.

1553
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:57,623
So he asked the media
to slant the news.

1554
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,001
And you go along with it
like everybody else?

1555
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,919
No way. l refused.

1556
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,922
So he... Shit! What does he do?
So Scanlon decides...

1557
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,090
to go really dirty.

1558
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:09,093
Makes a pact with a criminal.
Chudnofsky kills your reporter.

1559
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,428
Vertolibe? Vertoleeb?

1560
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,514
L didn't want more bloodshed,
so I stopped reporting on crime.

1561
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,474
To be honest,
in the last few years...

1562
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:17,935
this paper has dipped
in quality and ambition.

1563
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,146
Scanlon can hold up
his part of the deal...

1564
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:23,733
keeping the media under control,
and Chudnofsky does what he wants!

1565
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:24,942
To be honest....

1566
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,945
But Chudnofsky
had a different plan.

1567
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:30,781
He wanted to take over
all the gangs of L.A.

1568
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,616
So that's when you decided...

1569
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:33,951
to cut the strings.

1570
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,580
I couldn't look in the mirror.
I hated every word I said to you...

1571
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:38,789
that morning, Britt.

1572
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,667
So you start reporting
on crime again.

1573
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,419
And now Scanlon
is a dead man...

1574
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:45,463
unless he proves
he's still in control.

1575
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,256
He has no choice
but to organize...

1576
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:48,799
a meeting with you...

1577
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,135
and he kills you himself.

1578
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:53,804
In the end...

1579
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,474
you stood up
for what's right, Dad.

1580
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,392
Now l have to do the same.

1581
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:06,525
I can see by that expression you've
had on your face for five minutes...

1582
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:09,278
that you're piecing this together,
but it's no good.

1583
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,530
You're about to be killed
by the Green Hornet.

1584
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,157
What?

1585
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:20,664
The Green Hornet's sidekick!
He's got a gun!

1586
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:24,752
Bluff! Bluff!

1587
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:26,504
Eradicate!

1588
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,426
Before you do this,
I want you to know that l'm sorry.

1589
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,678
I'm sorry for everything.

1590
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:36,722
I forgive you.

1591
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,354
Hey, not me. Him, stupid.

1592
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,272
Confused? You should be.

1593
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:47,358
Go, go.

1594
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:48,651
Let's bail, Kato!

1595
01:30:49,528 --> 01:30:50,361
Back here!

1596
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,871
We're cornered!

1597
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,374
Know what happens
when you corner a hornet?

1598
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:04,875
- No!
- You get stung!

1599
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,462
Oh, Je...!

1600
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,054
See? Backups.

1601
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,392
Go, go, go!

1602
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,649
What the hell?
He's supposed to kill Britt Reid!

1603
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,943
- He's shooting at me!
- Embark the vehicle!

1604
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,486
Okay, okay, okay.

1605
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:43,789
Are you okay?

1606
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:45,457
Wait. Yeah, l'm fine.

1607
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:46,959
My outfit's back here.

1608
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,590
Britt Reid is the Green Hornet!

1609
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,717
I know.
You hired a guy to kill himself.

1610
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,094
Shut up!

1611
01:31:57,888 --> 01:32:00,598
Britt Reid recorded
the whole conversation...

1612
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,099
on some sushi drive USB!

1613
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,601
We can't lose him!

1614
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,686
We're not losing him,
we're following him!

1615
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:06,854
Oh, Kato. Thank you.

1616
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:09,315
- l need to hug you to thank you!
- What the hell?

1617
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:10,149
Okay.

1618
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:11,442
- To the house?
- No!

1619
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:12,693
Here's the dilly yo.

1620
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:16,197
We gotta get this to The Sentinel.
It's got Scanlon spilling the beans.

1621
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,115
We're gonna put it on the Net.

1622
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,075
It's what my father
would have wanted.

1623
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,077
- You like your father now?
- Yes!

1624
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,954
You see, he wasn't a dick after all.

1625
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:27,791
Well, he was a dick, just not
really how we thought he was.

1626
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:31,629
At the end, he wasn't a di... It's
complicated. l'll explain later, okay?

1627
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,631
It's a lot of conflicting emotions.

1628
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,466
Let's roll, Britt.

1629
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:45,809
Here's the thing, honestly.

1630
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,020
I've been jealous of you
this entire time.

1631
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,564
- You're awesome. You built this car.
- L know.

1632
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,900
- You know karate. You're charming.
- Thank you!

1633
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:54,902
These guys are amazingly
well organized.

1634
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:57,863
Hold on!

1635
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:01,992
Yeah! Yeah!

1636
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,203
Oh, yeah!

1637
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:11,085
Burn them from the side!

1638
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:12,920
Door guns!

1639
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,921
What's a door gun?

1640
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:14,672
Here!

1641
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:21,679
The other side!

1642
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:24,056
Your turn!

1643
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:30,854
Oh, God!

1644
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:39,697
Oh, shit!

1645
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:43,951
We lost him!

1646
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,120
- He's gone! He's gone!
- Yeah!

1647
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,706
Shit! He's back!

1648
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,374
You gotta be kidding me.

1649
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:51,750
These guys are good!

1650
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,211
Over there, over there!

1651
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:56,714
We're not gonna make it, dude.

1652
01:33:57,882 --> 01:33:59,049
We're not gonna make it!

1653
01:33:59,217 --> 01:34:00,551
Yeah, we're gonna make it!

1654
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,066
That's a very big gun.

1655
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:29,997
Kato, be careful!

1656
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:32,499
Take the wheel.

1657
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:33,417
What?!

1658
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:34,752
- Take the wheel.
- L can't!

1659
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:35,878
Yes, you can!

1660
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:37,880
Nunchucks?! That was my idea!

1661
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:39,923
Where are you going?

1662
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,766
Are you okay?
What are you doing?

1663
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:03,697
Shit! Shit!

1664
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:04,531
Kato!

1665
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:05,532
Jesus!

1666
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,159
I don't know what anything does!

1667
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:09,186
Why didn't you do this in English?!

1668
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,505
- What are you saying?
- Closer.

1669
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:20,672
Just jump in!

1670
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,840
Turn the knob!

1671
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:23,467
These guys are shooting at me!

1672
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:26,887
- Sorry! l'm sorry!
- Turn the knob!

1673
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:28,389
- l don't know how!
- Calm down!

1674
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:31,642
How do l stop it?

1675
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,186
Oh, God, l'm sorry.

1676
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:40,692
- lt's on fire!
- Lt's okay.

1677
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,152
It's okay!

1678
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,821
Next time, don't touch anything.

1679
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,367
Kato! Look!

1680
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:49,660
We made it!

1681
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:51,412
- Kato, we made it!
- Hell, yeah!

1682
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:52,579
Yeah!

1683
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,373
- l can't.
- Okay, that's cool.

1684
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,465
Oh, we're screwed!

1685
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:26,697
Come on, hurry! Hurry up!

1686
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:35,831
Did you drop it?

1687
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:36,665
Yes.

1688
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:37,666
Shit!

1689
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,006
Go get it! l'll cover you!

1690
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:45,466
Wish me luck!

1691
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:48,302
Good luck!

1692
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,618
Dear Hornet...

1693
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,203
be it my mask...

1694
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,038
or your blood, red will be...

1695
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:16,914
the last...

1696
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,751
It's Britt Reid!

1697
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:22,211
There he is! Get him!

1698
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:24,254
Don't let them go!

1699
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:25,422
Come on!

1700
01:37:26,591 --> 01:37:28,008
Get him! Get him!

1701
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:32,513
Let me shoot him!

1702
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:35,057
Oh, no.

1703
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:38,727
Shoot to kill!

1704
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,022
You brought a gas mask?!

1705
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,649
Of course I brought a gas mask!

1706
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:44,775
Just for yourself?!

1707
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:50,280
Where the...?

1708
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:12,302
There!

1709
01:38:17,267 --> 01:38:18,475
There! Behind the paper!

1710
01:38:25,775 --> 01:38:26,608
Over here!

1711
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:33,699
The helmet, it fogs up everything.

1712
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,126
There. There.

1713
01:38:44,294 --> 01:38:44,960
Shoot, shoot.

1714
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:51,508
Kato!

1715
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:55,637
Kato, save me!

1716
01:39:04,022 --> 01:39:05,439
I'm ungassable!

1717
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,031
Move it!

1718
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:22,372
That was dangerous.

1719
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:26,877
Drop me by the elevators,
I'll take it from here!

1720
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:33,759
No, we stay together!

1721
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:41,683
Get in the front seat!

1722
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:42,643
Quick! Quick!

1723
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:54,696
Tenth floor! Tenth floor!

1724
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:55,572
What works?

1725
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,240
- Missiles?
- Four missiles left.

1726
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:58,533
Hornet gun?

1727
01:39:58,701 --> 01:39:59,868
Check. Machine guns?

1728
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:00,702
Check.

1729
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:01,662
Does it drive?

1730
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,497
Front-wheel drive.

1731
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:09,670
Get out!

1732
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:10,837
Get out of here!

1733
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,261
You can let me out here.

1734
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:24,726
Bazooka!

1735
01:40:24,894 --> 01:40:25,852
Guy with a bazooka!

1736
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:29,398
Missile!

1737
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:31,316
Fire!

1738
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:42,327
Reload!

1739
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:47,916
Kato, they're here.

1740
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,292
Go be a journalist.

1741
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,544
I'll kick ass.

1742
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:51,628
There they are!

1743
01:40:51,796 --> 01:40:52,421
There!

1744
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,055
Come on.

1745
01:41:09,105 --> 01:41:09,813
I'm there.

1746
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:12,232
In one minute,
this'll be all over the world.

1747
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:16,153
Blue team, go!

1748
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:18,989
Start up.

1749
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,493
Shit!

1750
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:28,999
Yeah.

1751
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:44,973
There!

1752
01:42:07,914 --> 01:42:09,706
Can you see him? I can't see him.

1753
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:38,819
Oh, l'm so stupid.

1754
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:50,539
All right, Reid!

1755
01:42:51,082 --> 01:42:52,541
Hand over the thing.

1756
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:53,542
You want it?!

1757
01:42:54,502 --> 01:42:55,544
Go get it!

1758
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:02,050
Where is it? Where is it?

1759
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:03,552
I am Bloodnofsky.

1760
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:06,429
I killed a thousand before
and l'll kill a thousand more.

1761
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:16,982
Now tremble before your death.

1762
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:20,026
For be it my mask,
or be it your blood...

1763
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,113
red will be the last color
you'll ever see.

1764
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:13,914
Britt.

1765
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:14,998
Britt!

1766
01:44:27,094 --> 01:44:27,802
- Shit!
- Hey!

1767
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:30,305
End of the road, Scanlon.

1768
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,682
Okay, okay.
Let's just calm down.

1769
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,434
Hand over the sushi.

1770
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:36,603
Yeah, hand it over.

1771
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:37,771
We can talk about it.

1772
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:39,606
- On the ground, now!
- Get down!

1773
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:41,691
It's the Green Hornet. Shoot him!

1774
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:48,531
Britt, quick!

1775
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:51,910
I'm District Attorney Frank Scanlon!

1776
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:54,871
That is the Green Hornet.
Go shoot him!

1777
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:57,707
Down on the ground!

1778
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:01,503
Kato, I screwed up!

1779
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:03,380
Scanlon's gonna
get away scot-free!

1780
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:04,839
No, he's not.

1781
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,161
Don't move. Don't move.

1782
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:46,339
Holy shit!

1783
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:48,216
Ejector seats!

1784
01:45:48,592 --> 01:45:49,759
You actually built them!

1785
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:50,927
It was a good idea.

1786
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:00,270
This is really scary.

1787
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,398
A high-speed chase
between the Green Hornet...

1788
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:06,359
and gang members has led
to The Daily Sentinel office...

1789
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:07,944
Oh, my God! I called it.

1790
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,031
Leaving a trail of demolished cars
and trucks in their path.

1791
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,909
Here's the story: We're on our way
to a costume party. Okay?

1792
01:46:15,536 --> 01:46:17,203
We gotta get out of our suits.

1793
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:19,456
Where the hell are we gonna go?

1794
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:22,682
No one knows why
the district attorney....

1795
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,210
Lenore!

1796
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:25,170
No, no, no.

1797
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:28,089
- Lenore, stop!
- No, wait!

1798
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:29,716
Stop. Lenore!

1799
01:46:29,884 --> 01:46:30,675
Lenore! Wait.

1800
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:31,968
How do you know my name?

1801
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:32,927
Kato.

1802
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:34,387
- lt's me.
- Oh, my God.

1803
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:37,974
You assholes!

1804
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:40,643
What the hell are you doing?!
You guys are criminals!

1805
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:42,479
You're criminals! Oh, my God.

1806
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:44,814
- Stop.
- We're helping people.

1807
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:47,358
Why ask me to do research
on the Green Hornet...

1808
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:49,069
when you are the Green Hornet?

1809
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,322
We don't know what we're doing.
We needed you. Don't you see?

1810
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:53,823
- You're the mastermind.
- What?

1811
01:46:54,909 --> 01:46:56,326
This is the police. Open up.

1812
01:46:56,494 --> 01:46:59,079
Please don't screw us.
We were trying to be good people.

1813
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,246
Think about it.

1814
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,666
Hello, officer, can I help you?

1815
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:06,044
We're looking for two masked men.
Seen anything?

1816
01:47:06,212 --> 01:47:07,504
Yeah, of course.

1817
01:47:07,713 --> 01:47:08,505
Really?

1818
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,673
They're all over the news
all the time.

1819
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:14,302
All right. Well, please report
anything suspicious.

1820
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,470
Absolutely.

1821
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:19,432
You guys are such stupid assholes!

1822
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,310
- What are you thinking?!
- Please forgive us. Forgive me.

1823
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,646
- Are you crazy?
- Kiss and make up later.

1824
01:47:24,814 --> 01:47:25,939
I don't kiss him!

1825
01:47:26,107 --> 01:47:27,315
I got a bullet in me!

1826
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:30,527
You and I don't kiss! You guys
might kiss, but l don't kiss you!

1827
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:33,780
I've been shot in the shoulder.

1828
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,490
Well, then go to the hospital!

1829
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:38,368
No! Don't you see? The police
know the Green Hornet was...

1830
01:47:38,536 --> 01:47:39,702
shot in the shoulder.

1831
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,872
If l go to the hospital,
they'll know l'm the Green Hornet.

1832
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,374
Yeah, you've been shot.

1833
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:45,792
- Here's what l need.
- What?

1834
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:48,002
Get me a spatula to bite
and a knife.

1835
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:51,381
You gotta dig this bullet
out of my meat. Do it.

1836
01:47:51,715 --> 01:47:52,882
I'm cold.

1837
01:47:54,844 --> 01:47:56,219
It's deep inside me.

1838
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:58,346
- Oh, God.
- Spatula.

1839
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:00,974
Okay, okay. Wait!

1840
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:02,308
- Sterilize it!
- What?

1841
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:03,560
Sterilize it.

1842
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,145
I don't wanna get gangrene.

1843
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:06,396
Say it, say it.

1844
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:08,731
Shon-di forever.

1845
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:11,401
- Here we go, this is hot. Let me see.
- Just wait.

1846
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:13,361
I'm not ready. Stop, stop, stop.

1847
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,196
Wait, it hurts.

1848
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:17,490
Okay, l can't do it.
Take me to the hospital.

1849
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:18,741
Would you just shut up?

1850
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:20,493
Okay, look, if l'm...

1851
01:48:20,661 --> 01:48:23,913
the mastermind of this, just let me
have a second of silence...

1852
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:26,583
so l can figure this out! Okay?

1853
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:28,376
Mere hours ago...

1854
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:31,337
the Green Hornet and a group
of his criminal underlings...

1855
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:34,591
launched a horrendous attack
on this building...

1856
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,303
that claimed the life of
District Attorney Frank Scanlon.

1857
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:39,888
It's unfortunate, but...

1858
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:42,098
you know, that's what happens.

1859
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:45,101
The Daily Sentinel will be rebuilt.

1860
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,270
And to start that off...

1861
01:48:47,438 --> 01:48:51,399
l am naming Mike Axford
the new editor in chief.

1862
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:54,527
Mike's great and he's
comfortable telling me off...

1863
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:57,030
so he's the perfect man
for the job.

1864
01:48:57,448 --> 01:49:00,950
We have to get this paper
back to the ideals...

1865
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:03,703
that my father started it on.

1866
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:08,291
I wanna make him proud,
and l hope to...

1867
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:12,629
make this city proud of
The Daily Sentinel like never before.

1868
01:49:17,343 --> 01:49:19,469
The Green Hornet
sends his regards.

1869
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:25,141
He shot me!

1870
01:49:26,268 --> 01:49:27,560
Directly in the shoulder!

1871
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:30,647
The Green Hornet's sidekick
shot Britt Reid!

1872
01:49:31,148 --> 01:49:32,440
Get me to the hospital!

1873
01:49:32,608 --> 01:49:34,067
He's been shot in the shoulder!

1874
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:36,569
We gotta get him
to a hospital right away!

1875
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:39,656
It worked.

1876
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,945
Kato.

1877
01:50:19,196 --> 01:50:19,946
Hey!

1878
01:50:20,197 --> 01:50:22,365
We have a secret mission.
Everything...

1879
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:24,951
we've done up till now is
complete and utter crap!

1880
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,786
This is all that matters.

1881
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:28,871
This is it.

1882
01:50:29,331 --> 01:50:30,707
Let's roll, Kato.

1883
01:50:38,549 --> 01:50:39,924
It's crooked.

1884
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:41,884
He's kind of...

1885
01:50:42,219 --> 01:50:43,886
He's kind of looking....

1886
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:45,346
Down?

1887
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:46,723
It's fine.

1888
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:48,391
Doesn't matter.

1889
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:50,226
We did it.

1890
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:52,228
We did.

1891
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:54,731
The Green Hornet.

1892
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:56,733
His reliable partner...

1893
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,401
The Blue Wombat.

1894
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,362
Oh, man.

1895
01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:05,950
Okay, how about
The Red Hippopotamus?

1896
01:51:06,952 --> 01:51:08,411
No? Not Red Hippopotamus?

1897
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:10,038
Hippos are not red.

1898
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:12,373
I know. Hornets aren't green.
Who cares?

1899
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:15,043
The Orange Albatross.
