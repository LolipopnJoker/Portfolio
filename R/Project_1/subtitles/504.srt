1
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,439
You have no actual
medical training?

2
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,502
No. I have kids.

3
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:00,639
I learned a lot right there.

4
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:05,515
I've seen nurses give my son
throat cultures and... What is it?

5
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:08,920
You stick a giant Qtip down
their throat and wait.

6
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:11,458
Or a urinalysis where you take
that dipstick...

7
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,790
to see whether or not
the white count's high.

8
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,226
Yes, I understand.

9
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:17,230
And I'm great with people.

10
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,234
You'd have to observe me to know
for sure, but you can trust me on that.

11
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:25,272
I'm an extremely fast learner.
You show me something in a lab once...

12
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,604
and I've got it down.

13
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:31,877
I always wanted to go
to medical school.

14
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,107
That was my first interest, really...

15
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:38,117
but then I got married and had a kid
too young and that blew that.

16
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:40,814
When I got out of high school,
I got a job...

17
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:43,880
with Fleuer Engineers
and Constructors in Irvine.

18
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,983
I fell madly in love
with geology.

19
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:50,191
Geology?

20
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,324
I learned how to read maps.
I love maps.

21
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:55,631
But I lost my job because...

22
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:58,797
my boy came down with chicken pox,
had 104 temperature.

23
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:01,967
My ex-husband was useless, so...

24
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:04,011
that didn't really work out.

25
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,943
You got a really nice office.

26
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,589
Thanks.

27
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:22,822
Look.

28
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:55,252
Oh, fuck!

29
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,201
Goddamn it.

30
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:49,877
Good morning, Mr. Masry.
How are you doing today?

31
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,450
Fine, thanks. And you?

32
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:53,519
Very well.
Thank you for asking.

33
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,179
Good morning.

34
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,329
Did you see it last night?

35
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,730
I was out, but I taped it.
Don't tell me what happens.

36
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,200
It was so good.
Your 9:00 is here already.

37
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:20,978
Remind me.

38
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:24,641
Erin Brockovich. Car accident.
Not her fault, she says.

39
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,077
She was referred.

40
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:36,287
Erin, hi.

41
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,524
Ed Masry.
Sorry you had to wait.

42
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,162
That's okay.

43
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:44,759
Here, sit down.

44
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:55,145
Thank you.

45
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,878
I never thought just standing
could take it out of you...

46
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:05,947
but ever since that shithead hit me, I
feel like my body's put together wrong.

47
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,959
You poor thing.

48
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:12,162
Did anyone ask
if you wanted coffee?

49
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:14,961
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Good.

50
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:19,730
Listen. Whoever did this to you
made one hell of a mistake.

51
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:23,241
And you and me,
we're gonna make him pay for it.

52
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:30,211
Why don't you tell me
what happened.

53
00:05:30,283 --> 00:05:32,876
I was pulling out real slow...

54
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,009
and out of nowhere...

55
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,818
his Jaguar comes racing around
the corner like a bat out of hell.

56
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:43,486
They took some bone from my hip
and put it in my neck.

57
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:46,052
I don't have insurance, so...

58
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:50,726
I'm about $17,000 in debt
right now.

59
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:55,569
I couldn't take painkillers 'cause they
made me too groggy to care for my kids.

60
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,609
Matthew's eight
and Katie's almost six...

61
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:01,839
and Beth's just nine months.

62
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:05,040
I just wanna be a good mom,
a nice person...

63
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,344
a decent citizen.

64
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,648
I just wanna take good care
of my kids.

65
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:13,715
Yeah, I know.

66
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:18,353
Seventeen thousand in debt?

67
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:22,959
- Is your ex-husband helping?
- Which one?

68
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:26,498
There's more than one?

69
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,735
Yeah, there's two. Why?

70
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,847
So, you must've been feeling
pretty desperate that afternoon.

71
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:40,475
What's your point?

72
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:43,179
Broke, three kids, no job.

73
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:45,518
A doctor in a Jaguar?
Good meal ticket.

74
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:48,252
- Objection.
- What? He hit me.

75
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:49,258
So you say.

76
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:52,387
He came tearing around the corner
out of control.

77
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:57,127
An ER doctor who spends his days
saving lives was the one out of control?

78
00:06:57,202 --> 00:07:01,535
That asshole smashed in
my fucking neck.

79
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:08,235
- Open and fucking shut?
- It's that language that lost the case.

80
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:11,781
- It was over long before then.
- I told you they'd get personal.

81
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,282
- You told me I'd be set.
- I never said that.

82
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,615
You told me I had a good shot.
I had no shot.

83
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,780
- Let's settle down.
- Fuck settle down!

84
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,416
I've got $74 in the bank.
I can't afford to settle down.

85
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,323
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,423
Do they teach lawyers
to apologize?

87
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:30,762
Because you suck at it.

88
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:05,600
Hello?

89
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,072
You're back so soon.

90
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,471
Were you a good girl?

91
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,704
You're my little baby.

92
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,610
- What, is that a little cough?
- She's got a little cough.

93
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:22,412
I sat in the steam with her
to try to loosen it up, but...

94
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:24,613
I think I've got
some cough medicine.

95
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,085
Listen. I didn't want to
tell you before.

96
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,355
- You know, with your worries.
- What?

97
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,160
My daughter, she bought a big house
with a room for me.

98
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,758
- I'm moving in with her.
- When?

99
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,893
- Next week.
- Next week?

100
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:43,438
I know,
but it's good for me.

101
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,202
Now I can help my daughter
take care of my grandkids.

102
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,902
And it's good for you too.
Now that you have money...

103
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:53,277
you can hire a good baby-sitter,
not the old lady next door.

104
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,782
Thanks.

105
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:01,956
Matthew? Katie?
You back here?

106
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,225
Come on in.

107
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,192
Get in the house.
No dripping.

108
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,429
Okay.

109
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:21,200
Please don't get sick on me.
Please.

110
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,185
Let's fx some dinner.

111
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,097
Look at the water.

112
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,969
Oh, God!

113
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,405
Damn it.

114
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,568
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

115
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,718
We're going out.

116
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,956
Go ahead and order.

117
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,049
I'm gonna have a cheeseburger deluxe
with a Coke.

118
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:18,254
Mommy, can I have a cheeseburger deluxe
with no cheese and no bread?

119
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,328
- Did you get that?
- Yeah.

120
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:26,132
And she will have a cup of chicken broth
and a few crackers, please.

121
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:30,409
- And for you?
- Just a cup of coffee.

122
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:31,809
Mom, you're not eating?

123
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,976
My lawyer took me out to a fancy lunch
to celebrate, and I'm still stuffed.

124
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:38,575
How 'bout that?

125
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,054
I'm calling about the job ad
in the paper.

126
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,462
I'm calling about the job ad.

127
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,365
The great personality,
good voice.

128
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,528
I don't have any actual
sales experience.

129
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,131
I don't really have a resumÃ©,
but I can...

130
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,676
No, I don't have
any computer skills, but...

131
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:40,714
I thought it...
I thought it was the local store.

132
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,648
Okay.
Thanks anyway.

133
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:45,309
Okay, bye.

134
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,986
Ed Masry, please.

135
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,290
Yes, I'm holding for Ed Masry.

136
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:57,057
Is he ever in the office?

137
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:59,691
I've called about a dozen times.

138
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,563
Yes, I'd like to leave
another message.

139
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:05,435
Brockovich.
B-R-O-C-K-O-V-l-C-H.

140
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:09,202
I'm a client. I want him to call me.
It's as simple as that.

141
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,221
Goddamn it!

142
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,403
Who put that there?

143
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:39,405
Those are the files
you asked for.

144
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:42,100
But I didn't ask for you
to put it in the middle of the floor.

145
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,575
Look at me.
Get a towel, will you?

146
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,009
- What's she doing here?
- Who?

147
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,884
What's she doing here?

148
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,620
She works here.

149
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,933
How's it goin'?

150
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:20,403
You never called me back.
I left messages.

151
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:23,073
You did?
Well, I didn't know that.

152
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,049
Donald seems to think...

153
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,551
There's two things that aggravate me,
Mr. Masry:

154
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,986
Being ignored
and being lied to.

155
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:32,456
- I never lied.
- You told me things would be fine.

156
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:34,493
They're not.
I trusted you.

157
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,996
- Sorry about that.
- I don't need pity. I need a paycheck.

158
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:41,500
And I've looked. But when you spend
the past six years raising babies...

159
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:44,127
it's real hard to convince someone to
give you a job that pays worth a damn.

160
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:48,367
Are you gettin' every word of this down,
honey, or am I talkin' too fast for you?

161
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:51,170
I'm sorry about that.
I really am.

162
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,507
- We have a full staff right now.
- Bullshit!

163
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,515
If you had a full staff, this office
would return a client's phone call.

164
00:13:57,584 --> 00:14:00,450
I'm smart, I'm hardworking
and I'll do anything...

165
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,544
and I'm not leaving here
without a job.

166
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,798
Don't make me beg.

167
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,464
If it doesn't work out,
fire me.

168
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:23,907
Don't make me beg.

169
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,541
No benefits.

170
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:38,622
What we do in here
is file all of the cases.

171
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:42,422
That way, at any time,
we can tell the status of a file...

172
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:45,225
you know, where it is in the office,
stuff like that.

173
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,858
Here's where we organize
all the files alphabetically.

174
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:50,867
Simple enough.

175
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,028
And here is your desk.

176
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,107
Now I want to show you
where the Xerox machine is.

177
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,699
Everybody has a code
and you need to know about that.

178
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:01,005
- Do I get to pick my own code?
- We'll see.

179
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:11,889
I was wondering, who would I talk to
about getting an advance on my paycheck?

180
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,356
Just for the weekend.

181
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:18,419
Rosalind's the office manager.
She handles the payroll and petty cash.

182
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:24,061
But she's gone already.
She leaves early on Fridays.

183
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:30,736
- Okay. Thank you.
- For Pete's sake. Here.

184
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:36,071
I've only got hundreds.

185
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,016
Here.

186
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,849
I don't want your money.

187
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:47,790
Where do you think
your paycheck comes from? Here.

188
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,555
- Have a good weekend.
- Thank you.

189
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,061
See ya.

190
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,139
Hi, my sweetie.

191
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,217
How are you?
Matthew. Katie.

192
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:15,718
Hey, Mom.

193
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:21,821
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

194
00:17:06,538 --> 00:17:07,765
Hello.

195
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:10,567
What are you doing
making all that goddamn noise?

196
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:15,608
Introducing ourselves
to the neighborhood, I guess.

197
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,341
Well, I'm the neighbors.

198
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,111
There. We're introduced.
So shut the fuck up.

199
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:25,922
Wait. Hold on there.

200
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,356
Let's start over, okay?
My name's George. What's yours?

201
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:34,329
Just think of me as the person next door
who likes it quiet.

202
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:35,990
Don't be like that.

203
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,466
We live next door to each other,
and I feel bad.

204
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:41,504
I feel terrible.
I'm sorry. Will you accept my apology?

205
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:45,508
We're livin' next door to each other.
If you need a cup of sugar...

206
00:17:45,577 --> 00:17:47,874
- I don't need sugar.
- You don't.

207
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:51,005
Why don't I take you out to dinner
to apologize for my rudeness?

208
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:53,914
You give me your number.
I already got your address.

209
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:56,418
So you can't get away.

210
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,646
I'll call you up proper
and ask you out.

211
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:01,487
You want my number?

212
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,855
I do. I do want your number.

213
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:08,195
Which number do you want?
George?

214
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,532
George.
I like the way you say that.

215
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,159
How many numbers you got?

216
00:18:13,237 --> 00:18:16,899
I got numbers coming out of my ears.
For instance, ten.

217
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,372
Yeah. That's how many months old
my baby girl is.

218
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,007
You got a little girl?

219
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,207
Sexy, huh?
How about this for a number?

220
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:30,082
Six. That's how old my other daughter
is. Eight is the age of my son.

221
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:33,019
Two is how many times I've been married
and divorced.

222
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,557
Sixteen is the number of dollars
I have in my bank account.

223
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:38,651
850-3943,
that's my phone number.

224
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:43,461
With all the numbers I gave you, I guess
zero is how many times you'll call.

225
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:47,192
How do you remember your bank balance
off the top of your head?

226
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:49,362
That impresses me.

227
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:51,906
You're dead wrong
about that zero thing.

228
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:03,076
How long has she been
crying like that?

229
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:06,978
She's got that tooth comin' in.

230
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,354
Give her a cold wash cloth to suck on.
I got to go.

231
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,450
I'll check back later.

232
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:12,551
Where's Anna?

233
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,495
She's out to lunch with the girls.

234
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,201
I have to open a file.

235
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,628
Real estate thing,
pro bono.

236
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:28,542
- You know how to do that, don't you?
- Yeah, I got it. No problem.

237
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:33,442
You're a girl.

238
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:36,509
Excuse me?

239
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:40,384
Why aren't you out to lunch
with the girls? You're a girl.

240
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:44,625
I guess I'm not the right kind.

241
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,857
You may want to,
now that you're working here...

242
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,030
you may want to rethink
your wardrobe a little.

243
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:01,602
Why is that?

244
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,873
Well, I think some of the girls...

245
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:08,814
are a little uncomfortable
because of what you wear.

246
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,617
Is that so?

247
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:15,952
Well, it just so happens...

248
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,049
I think I look nice.

249
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:21,562
And as long as I have one ass instead
of two, I'll wear what I like...

250
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,392
if that's okay.

251
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,032
You might wanna rethink
those ties.

252
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:51,590
With this real estate stuff,
could you remind me?

253
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,025
I'm a little confused
exactly how we do it.

254
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:58,794
Why are there medical records and
blood samples in real estate files?

255
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,801
You've been here long enough.

256
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:05,270
If you don't know how to do your job,
I'm not about to do it for you.

257
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,288
Hello?

258
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:21,704
What the hell happened?

259
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:25,775
- Hungry?
- Am l...

260
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:28,985
Why are they here?
I went to pick them up.

261
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,992
She came by and said something came up
and had to drop the kids off.

262
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,392
Something came up?
Why didn't she call me at work?

263
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:40,296
I don't know.
She... I was... I don't know why.

264
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:43,335
- That stupid bitch!
- Mom!

265
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:47,304
Sorry. I just can't believe she dumps
my kids off when nobody's home.

266
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:49,500
I was home.

267
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,567
We're fine.
We cooked some burgers, had some milk.

268
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,512
Want a hot dog?
There an extra one on the grill.

269
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,843
Or a cheeseburger.

270
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,941
But this mustard is slippery.

271
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:03,716
Mom, what do you think
about me getting a tattoo?

272
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,723
One, two, three.

273
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:13,830
I got kings.
You win. You got a joker.

274
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,026
King. Joker.

275
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:20,469
You stole a joker!

276
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,202
- You cheat!
- What do you mean, I cheat?

277
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:25,701
You're cheating!

278
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,110
Get another one.

279
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:30,910
Time to go to bed.

280
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:33,508
Excuse me. Get ready for bed.
Brush your teeth.

281
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:35,643
Play tomorrow?

282
00:23:40,827 --> 00:23:42,657
Good night, buddy.

283
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,093
What's that?

284
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:47,496
This is a Harley-Davidson.
It's the best damn motorcycle ever made.

285
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,627
And if I ever catch either one of you
near one, I'll knock you silly.

286
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:59,540
Brush your teeth. And keep it down.
The baby's asleep.

287
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:02,213
You got great kids.

288
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,177
Well, I'm sure
I'll fuck 'em up eventually.

289
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,050
Why?

290
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:11,688
Obviously, not a good judge
of character...

291
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:14,384
or I would never have left them
with that idiot...

292
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,020
who cost a fortune
and smelled like chicken fat.

293
00:24:18,097 --> 00:24:20,360
And after I find her
and kill her...

294
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:23,162
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

295
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,736
If you need help with them,
I can do that.

296
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:29,399
- I'm not leaving my kids with you.
- Why?

297
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:33,377
- I don't even know you.
- What do you want to know? Ask.

298
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:36,937
- Thanks for today.
- You're welcome.

299
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,949
It was my pleasure.

300
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,715
- How many decks do you guys have here?
- We have more than enough.

301
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,314
What, you got so many friends
you can't use one more?

302
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:53,488
I'm serious. If you need someone
to look after your kids after school...

303
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:55,658
I don't have a job now, so...

304
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:00,499
That's a great recommendation.
I'm unemployed.

305
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:01,903
By choice.

306
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:03,907
I work when I need to.

307
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:07,570
What do you do the rest of the time,
live off your trust fund?

308
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:12,015
I do construction which pays real good,
and I make it last by livin' cheap.

309
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,244
I hope that's not supposed
to impress me.

310
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,048
Hey, bed.

311
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:18,055
Your little ghosts.

312
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,384
You always this hard on people
who try to help you?

313
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:25,628
I'm out of practice.

314
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,995
Well, let me remind you, then.

315
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,160
The polite thing is to say,
Thank you. Start it off with that.

316
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:35,239
And you could say,
Hey, that's a really nice offer.

317
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:37,865
I don't mind taking you up
on that."

318
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:40,410
Why the hell
do you wanna watch my kids?

319
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:41,705
- I like kids.
- Right.

320
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,714
I like hanging out with them.
They keep it simple.

321
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,015
You're home every afternoon?

322
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:51,316
I'm usually just workin'
on my bike.

323
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,148
It's no big deal.

324
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:59,992
If it doesn't work out, you can send
them back to the chicken fat lady.

325
00:26:06,337 --> 00:26:08,236
This isn't gonna get you laid.

326
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,764
Get in bed.

327
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:15,073
That's good, 'cause I didn't
find you attractive either.

328
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,079
Well, good.
Then we're even.

329
00:26:17,148 --> 00:26:20,310
So we don't have to worry about that.
I'm glad we got that out of the way.

330
00:26:20,385 --> 00:26:23,251
- I feel much better.
- I do too. Really, seriously.

331
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:27,848
I can just look after the kids and
not worry about you coming on to me.

332
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:30,117
Bring the phone into the changing room.
Of course they won't.

333
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,848
Mrs. Masry, don't be such a tease.

334
00:27:32,923 --> 00:27:34,913
Hold on. Yeah?

335
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:37,892
Sorry. Would you mind
if I investigate this further?

336
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,393
Investigate what?

337
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:42,761
This real estate thing
with the Jensens. The pro bono case.

338
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,395
I just wanna make sure
I'm understanding what I'm reading.

339
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:49,869
- Sure.
- You don't mind?

340
00:27:51,074 --> 00:27:53,007
Okay. Great. Thanks.

341
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:04,778
Hi. Donna Jensen?

342
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:08,973
I'm Erin Brockovich,
with Masry and Vititoe.

343
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:11,109
Oh. You're a lawyer?

344
00:29:11,187 --> 00:29:12,813
Hell, no.

345
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:15,083
I hate lawyers.
I just work for 'em.

346
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:16,817
Do you have a minute?

347
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:19,918
I don't mean to be a pain
in PG&E's backside...

348
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:22,657
especially after all they've done
for Hinkley, but...

349
00:29:22,765 --> 00:29:25,232
I look around here and I think...

350
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:28,029
if they want this place,
they're gonna have to pay for it.

351
00:29:28,104 --> 00:29:32,506
So you didn't put the house up for sale?
They just wanted to buy it.

352
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:34,269
Oh, yeah.

353
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:36,572
I don't wanna move.

354
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:40,012
Uproot the kids?
I got a couple of girls.

355
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:43,573
Honest to God,
I don't know if I have the energy.

356
00:29:43,653 --> 00:29:47,679
You know, I've been sick.
Me and Pete both have.

357
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:51,185
The whole idea of selling this house...

358
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,228
if they're not gonna pay us properly,
I just don't see the point.

359
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:58,825
I can see that. But...

360
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:04,429
The thing confusing me, not that your
medical problems aren't important...

361
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:09,273
but how come the files on that
are in with all the real estate stuff?

362
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,374
There's so much correspondence,
I just keep it all in one place.

363
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,383
Right. Right.

364
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:22,055
I'm sorry.
I just don't see...

365
00:30:22,123 --> 00:30:27,253
why you're corresponding with PG&E
about your medical problems at all.

366
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:30,388
Well, they paid
for the doctor's visit.

367
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,357
They did?

368
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:35,902
You bet. Paid for a checkup
for the whole family.

369
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:38,131
And not like with insurance
where you pay...

370
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:41,140
and a year goes by
and maybe you see some money.

371
00:30:41,209 --> 00:30:44,075
They just took care of it,
just like that.

372
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:47,739
- We never even saw a bill.
- Wow. Why'd they do that?

373
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,578
'Cause of the chromium.

374
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:51,880
- The what?
- The chromium.

375
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:55,012
Well, that's what kicked
this whole thing off.

376
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:39,124
- What kind of chromium is it?
- There's more than one?

377
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:42,464
There's straight up chromium, does
all kind of good things for the body.

378
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,004
Chrom three,
which is fairly benign.

379
00:31:45,073 --> 00:31:47,870
Then there's chrom six,
hexavalent chromium...

380
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:50,876
which, depending on the amounts,
can be very harmful.

381
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,878
Harmful, how?
What would you get?

382
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:57,347
With repeated exposure to toxic levels,
God, anything really...

383
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:01,376
from chronic headaches and nosebleeds
to respiratory disease...

384
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:04,389
liver failure, heart failure,
reproductive failure...

385
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:08,826
bone or organ deterioration,
plus, of course, any type of cancer.

386
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,954
So, that stuff,
it kills people.

387
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,694
Yeah, definitely.
Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.

388
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,760
It gets into your DNA too,
so you pass the trouble to your kids.

389
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,203
It's very, very bad.

390
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,241
What's it used for?

391
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:23,832
A rust inhibitor.

392
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:27,846
Utility plants use piston engines.
The engines get hot.

393
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:31,213
They run water through them. Chromium's
in the water to prevent corrosion.

394
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:35,687
Well, how do I find out what kind
of chromium they use in Hinkley?

395
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:38,223
- Been to their water board?
- What's that?

396
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:39,553
Every county has one.

397
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:42,492
It has records of anything water-related
within its jurisdiction.

398
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:45,792
- You should find something there.
- County water board.

399
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,798
All right.
Well, thanks.

400
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:49,994
Good luck.

401
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,004
I wouldn't advertise
what you're looking for.

402
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:56,906
Incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble.

403
00:32:58,178 --> 00:33:00,441
I'll remember that.
Thanks.

404
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:33,211
Damn, that's a heavy door.

405
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,838
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thank you very much.

406
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:39,406
- Aren't you a gentleman, Mr...
- Scott.

407
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,511
Mr. Scott.
Pleased to meet you.

408
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,885
I'm Erin.

409
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,617
Erin. Cool.

410
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,558
So what can I do for you?

411
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:53,222
Believe it or not, I'm on the prowl
for some water records.

412
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,926
- You've come to the right place.
- I guess I did.

413
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:02,839
Just tell me what you wanna look at
and I'd be glad to dig 'em out for you.

414
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:05,035
I wish I knew.
It's for my boss.

415
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:07,271
He's in this water dispute...

416
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:12,282
and he wants me to find all kinds
of papers from all kinds of places.

417
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:19,954
You know, it would probably
be easiest...

418
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:22,994
if I just squeezed back there
and poked around myself.

419
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,360
- Would that be all right with you?
- Heck, yeah. Come on back.

420
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,059
I'm just gonna need you
to sign in here.

421
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,226
Sure.

422
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,801
- Pattee. Is that your middle name?
- Maiden.

423
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,476
You're married?

424
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,510
Not anymore.

425
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,607
Can I just...

426
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,547
I love your pants.

427
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:53,623
Thanks.

428
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,182
This is it.

429
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:58,121
It's impressive.

430
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,488
I'll call you if I need anything.

431
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,495
Thank you.

432
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,578
Where's my stuff?

433
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:37,592
- Where have you been?
- Where the fuck's my stuff?

434
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:40,629
Don't you use language like that
with me. Who do you think you are?

435
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,059
- Someone took my stuff.
- Nice to see you.

436
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:50,071
- I had photos of my kids, a mug...
- Toothpaste, mousse and deodorant.

437
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,539
- Here.
- What's going on?

438
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:56,942
There may be jobs where you can
disappear, but this isn't one of'em.

439
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,777
Here, you don't do the work,
you don't get to stay.

440
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,647
I've been working.
Ask Mr. Masry. He knows.

441
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,950
You ask Mr. Masry.
He fired you.

442
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,389
You said to fire me?

443
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,621
I'll call you back.
You've been gone for a week.

444
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,722
I left a message. I was working
on this real estate thing.

445
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:21,327
- I was gonna write a report.
- You don't leave a message and take off.

446
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:25,134
- Do I check in every two seconds?
- Yes, it's called accountability.

447
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,574
- I'm not talking to you, bitch!
- Excuse me?

448
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,440
That's enough.
Look, Erin.

449
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:33,278
This incident aside, I don't think
this is the right place...

450
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,112
for you, okay?

451
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:38,950
So I'll make a few calls on your behalf
and find something else.

452
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:40,989
- Don't bother.
- I'm trying to help.

453
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:45,254
You're trying to feel less guilty
about firing someone with three kids.

454
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,727
Fuck if I'm gonna help you
do that!

455
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,664
Get back to work!

456
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:16,887
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Fixing the leak under your sink.

457
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:20,223
Damn it, George. I don't ask you
to do things like that.

458
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,864
Look at this mess you've made.

459
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:25,524
I'm not done with that.

460
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:27,067
Get it out.

461
00:38:27,136 --> 00:38:28,659
- Jesus!
- Relax.

462
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:31,103
Shit! Where did it go?

463
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:33,505
- Where is it?
- Somewhere back there.

464
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,770
Behind your foot.
Going up your leg now.

465
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:39,905
Jesus!
Who fucking lives like this?

466
00:38:39,982 --> 00:38:42,643
Who lets their kids run around
in a place...

467
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:45,584
that is crawling with bugs
the size of house cats?

468
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:48,851
All you have to do is call
an exterminator. Everybody gets them.

469
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,858
I can't call an exterminator.

470
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:55,385
I can't afford one.
I can't even afford my phone.

471
00:38:58,534 --> 00:38:59,693
I got fired.

472
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,963
What?

473
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:05,666
What do you mean you got fired?
You're working so hard.

474
00:39:06,742 --> 00:39:08,675
It doesn't matter.

475
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:14,376
It doesn't make one fucking
bit of difference.

476
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:31,396
I don't know what happened to me.

477
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,135
I mean...

478
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:41,572
God, I was Miss Wichita,
for Christ's sake.

479
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:45,443
Did I tell you that?

480
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:52,816
You are living next door
to a real live fucking beauty queen.

481
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:00,790
I still have my tiara.

482
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:07,423
And I thought it meant I was gonna
do something important with my life...

483
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:10,834
that it meant I was someone.

484
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:20,078
You're someone to me.

485
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:33,291
Are you gonna be something else
that I have to survive?

486
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,493
'Cause I'll tell you the truth.

487
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,501
I'm not up to it.

488
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,068
So I get up on the stage, right?

489
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:29,114
And I have the big bouquet
of flowers.

490
00:41:29,183 --> 00:41:31,810
And I had my foot out like this,
and I say...

491
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:35,843
I will devote my entire reign
as Miss Wichita...

492
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:38,321
to bringing an end
to world hunger...

493
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:41,622
and to the creation
of a peaceful Earth...

494
00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:44,458
- for every man, woman and child."
- God!

495
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:47,499
- How long were you Miss Wichita?
- One year.

496
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:52,193
Of course, by the time I got through
opening new supermarkets...

497
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:57,709
I only had a few weeks left
to work on hunger and world peace.

498
00:41:57,778 --> 00:42:00,769
- Right.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

499
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:04,046
What about you, huh?

500
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:05,709
What about me?

501
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:10,079
What about you?

502
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,155
Hey, baby,
let me tell you somethin'.

503
00:42:14,228 --> 00:42:16,991
Let me get that out of your hair.

504
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:20,965
- Thank you.
- Nice.

505
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:29,136
You're a very special lady.

506
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:38,309
- Don't be too nice to me, okay?
- Why?

507
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,353
Makes me nervous.

508
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,933
It's some slim pickings here, baby.

509
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:03,440
Maybe that's Ed McMahon.
Let's go see.

510
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:11,140
Wrong Ed.

511
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:13,581
- I'm sorry?
- What are you doing here?

512
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:16,415
I had an interesting call
this afternoon...

513
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:19,080
from Dr. Frankel from UCLA.

514
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:24,555
He wanted you to know that the legal
limit for hexavalent chromium...

515
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:29,361
is.05 parts per million.

516
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:33,199
And at the rate you mentioned, .58...

517
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:37,900
it could be responsible for the cancers
in that family you asked about...

518
00:43:37,976 --> 00:43:40,273
the Jensens.

519
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:43,040
Well, wasn't that nice of him?

520
00:43:43,115 --> 00:43:47,346
Isn't it funny how some people
help people and others just fire them?

521
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:51,514
I'm sorry. You were gone.
I assumed you were off having fun.

522
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:54,614
And why the hell
would you assume that?

523
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:58,786
I don't know. Maybe you look like
someone who has a lot of fun.

524
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:01,798
So by that standard,
I should assume you never get laid.

525
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:05,327
I'm married.

526
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:11,941
What is all this...
What is the story on this cancer?

527
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,247
You wanna know? Hire me back.
I got a ton of bills to pay.

528
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,285
Fine.

529
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:28,422
So Donna just put in these new cabinets,
real nice, stained the wood and all...

530
00:44:28,493 --> 00:44:30,960
when she gets a call
from somebody at PG&E...

531
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:33,529
saying a freeway's gonna be built
and they wanna buy her house...

532
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:35,531
to put in an off-ramp
to the plant.

533
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,363
Meanwhile, the husband's sick
with Hodgkin's.

534
00:44:38,436 --> 00:44:40,699
She's in and out of the hospital
with tumors...

535
00:44:40,772 --> 00:44:43,239
believing one thing
has nothing to do with the other.

536
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,673
Because PG&E told her
about the chromium?

537
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,768
Get this.
They had a seminar.

538
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:52,110
They invited 200 residents
from the area, had it at the plant...

539
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:55,175
telling them all about chromium three,
and how good it is for you...

540
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,687
when all the time
they're using chromium six.

541
00:44:58,824 --> 00:45:03,157
That document you found
at the water board...

542
00:45:03,228 --> 00:45:07,095
the one that says
about the bad chromium...

543
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,759
you didn't happen to make a copy?

544
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:12,496
Of course I did.

545
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:14,663
Well, could I have a look at it?

546
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:16,968
I want a raise.

547
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:20,943
And benefits, including dental.

548
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,980
This isn't the way I do business.

549
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:25,606
- What way is that?
- Extortion.

550
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,019
A 5% raise.
We'll talk about benefits later.

551
00:45:36,094 --> 00:45:37,720
Ten.

552
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:41,993
There are lots of other places
I could get work.

553
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:46,835
Ten percent raise and benefits.
But that's it. I'm drawing the line.

554
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,831
He's drawing the line.

555
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:02,115
Is this all you've got?

556
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,450
So far. That place is a pigsty.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

557
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,717
Yeah, those things are a mess.

558
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:12,028
What makes you think
you can just walk in there...

559
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:15,259
and find what we need?

560
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,225
They're called boobs, Ed.

561
00:46:37,888 --> 00:46:39,115
I understand.

562
00:46:39,223 --> 00:46:42,419
Okay, I agree.
I'm going to.

563
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:44,084
Right now.

564
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:53,631
I'm almost done. Look.

565
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:55,796
How are we doing?

566
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:58,272
We're doing great.

567
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:00,999
Good.

568
00:47:01,078 --> 00:47:05,411
You've got quite a lot
done already, so...

569
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,647
I'm sorry, but we need
those records back now, okay?

570
00:47:12,423 --> 00:47:13,889
What?

571
00:47:13,991 --> 00:47:16,550
These papers are a matter
of public record...

572
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,026
and I'm not leaving
until they're copied.

573
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:37,203
Fax these to this number, okay?

574
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,544
- All of them?
- All of them!

575
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:04,470
An on-site monitoring well?
That means it was...

576
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,565
Right on the PG&E property.

577
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:10,478
And you say that this stuff...

578
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:12,480
hexavalent chromium...

579
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,278
it's poisonous.

580
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:26,795
It's gotta be different
than what's in our water...

581
00:48:26,864 --> 00:48:28,592
'cause ours is okay.

582
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:30,632
The guys from PG&E told me.

583
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:35,262
They sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine.

584
00:48:36,573 --> 00:48:40,975
I know, but the toxicologist
I've been talking to...

585
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:46,175
he gave me a list of problems that can
come from hexavalent chromium exposure.

586
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,514
Everything you all have
is on that list.

587
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:57,858
No, that's not what
our doctor said.

588
00:48:59,063 --> 00:49:00,654
He said that...

589
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:05,330
that one's got absolutely
nothing to do with the other.

590
00:49:05,402 --> 00:49:06,925
Right.

591
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:09,403
But PG&E paid for that doctor.

592
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:36,291
- Get out of the pool!
- How come?

593
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:37,855
'Cause I said so!

594
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,298
That's it. Okay, girls.

595
00:49:43,941 --> 00:49:46,875
The minute Brenda sent that fax...

596
00:49:46,944 --> 00:49:50,470
I'm saying the second
she pressed the send button...

597
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:56,544
PG&E's claim department
was on the phone to me...

598
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:58,779
scheduling a meeting.

599
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:01,721
So you think...
Wait. Let me do it.

600
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:05,124
You're driving me nuts.
You think we scared 'em, don't you?

601
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:07,685
They've taken the trouble
to send someone.

602
00:50:07,764 --> 00:50:11,199
Sure as hell sounds like
they're sitting up and taking notice.

603
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:27,907
Mr. Foil?

604
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,176
In the interest of putting
this whole thing to rest...

605
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:37,054
PG&E is willing to offer the Jensens
$250,000 for their home.

606
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:39,150
$250,000?

607
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:43,220
In terms of land value
out in Hinkley...

608
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:45,766
we feel that's
a more than fair price.

609
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:48,701
How about in terms
of medical expenses?

610
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:53,469
250,000 isn't come close to what
this family is gonna spend on doctors.

611
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:59,936
I understand they've had bad luck,
health-wise. They have my sympathies.

612
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,781
- But that's not PG&E's fault.
- You're kidding, right?

613
00:51:05,488 --> 00:51:07,455
Look at these readings.

614
00:51:07,557 --> 00:51:11,549
PG&E's own technicians
documented...

615
00:51:11,661 --> 00:51:17,098
toxic levels of hexavalent chromium
in those wells on numerous occasions.

616
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,599
Everything the Jensens
have had...

617
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:22,899
is proven reaction to exposure
to hexavalent chromium...

618
00:51:22,972 --> 00:51:24,905
and they have had...

619
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:34,715
Breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's
disease, immune deficiencies...

620
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:36,410
asthma, chronic nosebleeds.

621
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:39,112
A million things could have
caused those problems.

622
00:51:39,188 --> 00:51:43,453
Poor diet, bad genes,
irresponsible lifestyle.

623
00:51:43,526 --> 00:51:46,119
Our offer is final.
And it's more than fair.

624
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:49,322
Wait a minute.
I thought we were negotiating here.

625
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:56,466
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
is all I'm authorized to offer.

626
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,098
I'll present your offer
to my clients.

627
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:03,701
I'll doubt they'll accept.

628
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:07,405
Before you go off
on some crusade...

629
00:52:07,483 --> 00:52:10,212
you might wanna remember who it is
you're dealing with here.

630
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,913
PG&E's a $28 billion corporation.

631
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:17,423
Twenty-eight billion dollars?

632
00:52:17,526 --> 00:52:21,928
I didn't know it was that much.
Wow!

633
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,624
Holy cow!

634
00:52:26,702 --> 00:52:28,396
At least they made an offer.

635
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:31,371
That wasn't an offer.
A million would have been an offer.

636
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,670
And they send their mail clerk
to jerk me off, waste my time!

637
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:38,138
- Why would they do that?
- Because they can.

638
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:41,842
You heard that kid. They have
$28 billion at their disposal.

639
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,418
- They can afford to waste time.
- And you can't?

640
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,987
- You think I'm made of money?
- What are you yelling at me for?

641
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:48,851
- Because I'm pissed off!
- Good.

642
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,256
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you back!

643
00:53:02,071 --> 00:53:04,368
I really hate you sometimes.

644
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,873
No, you love me.

645
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,254
You've been reading for hours.

646
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,223
I'm a slow reader.

647
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:54,177
Excuse me.

648
00:53:55,324 --> 00:53:57,257
- Are you Erin Brockovich?
- Yeah.

649
00:53:58,094 --> 00:54:01,392
I'm Tom Robinson.
This is my wife Mandy.

650
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,123
We used to live across the street
from the Jensens.

651
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,133
I think you know Donna.

652
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,933
PG&E bought our house last year.

653
00:54:13,074 --> 00:54:17,339
The vets said they had
a bunch of tumors and stuff.

654
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:21,279
You can see
they couldn't really walk.

655
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:23,441
How many were born like this?

656
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,076
Twelve or thirteen or so.

657
00:54:27,188 --> 00:54:28,347
Yeah.

658
00:54:28,456 --> 00:54:32,414
When Donna told us about you and
what you told her about the chromium...

659
00:54:32,527 --> 00:54:35,461
we figured that might have something
to do with this too.

660
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,156
Yeah, it might.

661
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,324
- I'm really... May I keep these?
- Yeah.

662
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,892
Okay, great. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

663
00:54:44,806 --> 00:54:46,739
There's something else too.

664
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:49,940
What?

665
00:54:54,215 --> 00:54:57,240
Mandy here has had...

666
00:54:57,352 --> 00:54:58,978
five miscarriages.

667
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,812
I'm so sorry.

668
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:05,982
I figured it was something I did...

669
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,823
like when I smoked marijuana,
maybe...

670
00:55:08,897 --> 00:55:11,421
or took birth control pills.

671
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:13,329
But then Donna said...

672
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:17,632
that you thought that this chromium
might be to blame for her problems...

673
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:19,331
so I figured...

674
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,377
maybe it wasn't just me.

675
00:55:34,055 --> 00:55:35,487
Whoa.

676
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:42,795
I gotta take a bath.

677
00:55:43,898 --> 00:55:45,489
You should go in.

678
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,060
They're not asleep?

679
00:55:52,674 --> 00:55:55,039
Beth and Katie are.

680
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,919
How was school?

681
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,391
Fine.

682
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:16,792
- Did you do your homework?
- Yeah.

683
00:56:19,133 --> 00:56:20,394
Any problems?

684
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,640
I know you're upset, but...

685
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:38,378
the way this job is,
things come up at the last minute...

686
00:56:38,486 --> 00:56:40,419
real important things
that I gotta deal with...

687
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:42,045
Fine!

688
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:51,028
Please don't be mad at me.

689
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:53,157
I'm doing this for us.

690
00:56:53,234 --> 00:56:56,168
I know it's hard for you
to understand, but...

691
00:56:57,972 --> 00:57:00,963
Don't you want Mama
to be good at her job?

692
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,872
Hmm?

693
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:11,072
I don't miss dinner all the time.
We all ate together last night.

694
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:13,945
You were reading
the whole time.

695
00:57:20,094 --> 00:57:21,560
Okay.

696
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:42,479
There's something about this whole thing
I don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.

697
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:45,540
If PG&E messed with our water...

698
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:48,745
why would they bother saying
anything about it to us at all?

699
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:50,879
Why not just keep quiet?

700
00:57:50,991 --> 00:57:53,254
To establish
a statute of limitations.

701
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:56,557
In a case like this,
you only have one year...

702
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,598
from the time you first learn
about the problem to file suit.

703
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:02,065
So PG&E figures...

704
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:06,264
We'll let the cat out of the bag,
tell people the water's not perfect...

705
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,604
and if we can ride out the year
with no one suing...

706
00:58:09,676 --> 00:58:11,575
we'll be in the clear forever.

707
00:58:11,678 --> 00:58:14,111
But it was more than a year ago
that they told us.

708
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:17,445
- That's okay. We're not suing.
- Not yet.

709
00:58:17,551 --> 00:58:20,485
All we're doing
is using this information...

710
00:58:20,554 --> 00:58:23,488
to get you a real nice purchase price
on your house...

711
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:28,391
and you two a comparable
retroactive bonus on your sale price.

712
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:31,362
That way PG&E can still look good
to their shareholders...

713
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:33,694
'cause they're not involved
in an ugly lawsuit.

714
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:35,791
All they're doing
is buying a little property.

715
00:58:37,671 --> 00:58:40,764
Doesn't say here how much
this whole thing's gonna cost us.

716
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:44,907
My fee's 40 percent
of whatever you get awarded.

717
00:58:54,721 --> 00:58:57,120
Boy, do I know how you feel.

718
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:01,683
The first time I heard that number
I said, You've got to be kidding me.

719
00:59:01,762 --> 00:59:03,160
Forty goddamn percent?

720
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:07,165
I'm the one that's injured,
this joker sits at a desk all day...

721
00:59:07,234 --> 00:59:10,691
and he wants to walk away
with almost half my reward?"

722
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:12,067
But then...

723
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:14,504
I asked him...

724
00:59:14,574 --> 00:59:17,508
what he makes
if I don't get anything.

725
00:59:18,812 --> 00:59:21,006
Then I don't get anything either.

726
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:23,446
Plus, he's out all the costs.

727
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:25,983
So I realized...

728
00:59:26,053 --> 00:59:27,986
he's taking a chance too.

729
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:39,189
You got a pen, honey?

730
00:59:44,404 --> 00:59:45,700
All right, then.

731
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:51,440
Oh, I made a bundt cake.

732
00:59:51,511 --> 00:59:53,671
Who would like coffee and cake?

733
00:59:53,747 --> 00:59:55,941
- I do.
- We have to be getting back.

734
00:59:57,551 --> 01:00:00,041
Have a fucking cup of coffee, Ed.

735
01:00:00,153 --> 01:00:02,177
Coffee will be great.
Thank you.

736
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:04,256
- All right.
- I'll help you.

737
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:12,229
My wife makes really good
bundt cake.

738
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:13,822
I love bundt cake.

739
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:21,666
Well, seems like everybody in the family
ended up with a rash somehow.

740
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:25,871
It also seems like no matter what
we did for it, it always came back.

741
01:00:25,946 --> 01:00:28,709
Over what kind of period of time?

742
01:00:28,815 --> 01:00:31,612
Oh, a long time.
You know, years.

743
01:00:31,718 --> 01:00:36,051
We never did keep track of it.
Kids are sick, animals need to be fed.

744
01:00:36,123 --> 01:00:38,249
Just couldn't get rid of it,
that's all.

745
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:41,887
Uh, well, Mrs. DeSoto said...

746
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:45,192
that she wasn't exactly sure
what you had.

747
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:47,664
Oh, well, we know what it is.

748
01:00:47,734 --> 01:00:50,099
It's gastrointestinal cancer.

749
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,434
She got sick
about nine months ago...

750
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:56,600
and they operated on her
about six months ago.

751
01:00:56,676 --> 01:00:58,336
- The intestine.
- Right.

752
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:11,446
- Hi. I'm Erin Brock...
- I know who you are.

753
01:01:11,558 --> 01:01:12,649
Donna called me.

754
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:15,751
Oh. Can I come in?

755
01:01:16,663 --> 01:01:19,563
I told Donna we're not interested
in getting involved.

756
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:22,595
Can I ask why?

757
01:01:23,836 --> 01:01:25,700
What's the point?

758
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,967
Well, Donna told me that you
and your kids have been sick...

759
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:34,773
Oh, you people don't give a shit.

760
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,939
Anything to get what you want.

761
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:48,692
- It's good of you to have me here.
- It's a good day to come by.

762
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:50,284
She's feeling good today.

763
01:01:50,362 --> 01:01:55,663
Mike Ambrosino said he saw you folks
at the hospital from time to time...

764
01:01:55,734 --> 01:01:57,724
so that's what brought me
out here.

765
01:01:59,572 --> 01:02:03,166
Yeah, we've been there
from time to time.

766
01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:05,709
And you. Wooftie!

767
01:02:05,778 --> 01:02:07,267
Aren't you a beauty?

768
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:10,007
You have all the boys crazy,
don't you?

769
01:02:10,115 --> 01:02:13,481
I can see it in your eyes.
You drive 'em wild.

770
01:02:13,552 --> 01:02:15,348
You do, don't you?

771
01:02:15,421 --> 01:02:18,014
Torture 'em.
It's good for 'em.

772
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:23,155
Don't teach her anything
too early.

773
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:26,686
Yeah, she can't wait to get on
her new dress. Isn't that right?

774
01:02:26,765 --> 01:02:31,167
She wants to go back to school,
hopefully in the next couple of months.

775
01:02:31,237 --> 01:02:34,000
Yeah, get her out
of her nightgown here.

776
01:02:34,773 --> 01:02:36,706
She's gonna do it.

777
01:02:56,495 --> 01:02:58,086
Uh-uh. Absolutely not.

778
01:02:58,163 --> 01:03:00,653
- That's crazy. Why not?
- Because I said no.

779
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:05,897
PG&E is only talking to us because
this is a quiet real estate dispute.

780
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:09,565
We add plaintiffs, suddenly
we're in the middle of a toxic tort...

781
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:12,769
with a statute problem
against a massive utility.

782
01:03:12,845 --> 01:03:15,779
- No, thank you.
- Okay, so here's what I'll do.

783
01:03:15,881 --> 01:03:19,816
I'll go to Ted and Rita Daniels, two of
the nicest people you could ever meet...

784
01:03:19,885 --> 01:03:23,183
who every day watch their Annabelle
fight like a dog against cancer...

785
01:03:23,255 --> 01:03:28,385
and I'll tell them we can't help them
because you don't wanna work that hard.

786
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,893
Work hard?
Why, you little manipulative...

787
01:03:30,996 --> 01:03:33,896
Let me tell you something.
I've worked all my life.

788
01:03:33,999 --> 01:03:38,401
I built a firm and kept it alive through
lawsuits, injunctions and evictions.

789
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:41,632
I've survived a quadruple bypass,
cancer...

790
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:44,368
being born with one kidney
and having diabetes.

791
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:47,240
I've personally managed
to save a million dollars...

792
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:50,247
over 30 years of getting some clients
ten times that.

793
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:52,714
Don't tell me
I don't work hard.

794
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:56,151
Don't tell me I haven't earned the right
to stop, take a breath and enjoy life.

795
01:03:56,221 --> 01:03:59,155
What the hell do you know
about any of this anyway?

796
01:03:59,224 --> 01:04:02,590
Something like this, Erin,
it could take forever.

797
01:04:02,661 --> 01:04:04,389
They're a huge corporation.

798
01:04:04,463 --> 01:04:07,056
They could bury us in paperwork
for the next 15 years.

799
01:04:07,132 --> 01:04:09,497
I'm just a guy
with a small, private firm!

800
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:13,801
Who happens to know
they poisoned people and lied about it.

801
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:16,129
We can get these people.

802
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:20,234
With a little effort, I really think
we can nail their asses to the wall.

803
01:04:20,312 --> 01:04:22,609
With all your legal expertise,
you believe that?

804
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:25,649
- Don't you ever just know?
- Where's the money coming from?

805
01:04:25,718 --> 01:04:27,651
That's why most of these cases settle...
lack of money.

806
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,950
Do you know what toxicologists
and geology experts cost?

807
01:04:31,056 --> 01:04:33,114
A hundred grand a month, easy.

808
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:36,524
- I've already used a lot of my savings.
- We'll figure it out.

809
01:04:36,595 --> 01:04:38,528
I admit
I don't know shit about shit...

810
01:04:38,597 --> 01:04:40,689
but I know the difference
between right and wrong!

811
01:04:40,766 --> 01:04:43,757
- Lovers' quarrel?
- Oh, bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.

812
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,006
I feel you looking at me.

813
01:04:53,312 --> 01:04:54,278
I'm sorry.

814
01:04:57,483 --> 01:05:00,417
How many families
are we talking about here?

815
01:05:00,486 --> 01:05:02,976
Four more.
Eleven people so far.

816
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:04,349
You mean there's more?

817
01:05:04,423 --> 01:05:09,724
Well, I found one document that was
a toxic test-well reading from 1967.

818
01:05:09,794 --> 01:05:12,728
A hell of a lot more people
have lived on that land since then.

819
01:05:12,797 --> 01:05:15,594
Oh, this is
a whole different ball game.

820
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:17,428
A much bigger deal.

821
01:05:18,169 --> 01:05:21,137
Kinda like David
and what's-his-name.

822
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:26,608
It's kinda like David and
what's-his-name's whole fucking family.

823
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:30,343
Okay, here's the deal.

824
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:33,143
If, and only if, you find
all the evidence to back this up...

825
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:35,718
I'll do it, I'll take it on.

826
01:05:35,787 --> 01:05:37,344
You're doing the right thing.

827
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:38,887
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

828
01:05:38,956 --> 01:05:41,890
Remind me of that
when I'm filing for bankruptcy.

829
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:47,396
Of course, gathering evidence
is a big job.

830
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,932
A hell of a lot bigger
than just filing.

831
01:05:50,001 --> 01:05:51,900
I'll be working a lot harder now.

832
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:55,631
- Taking on a lot more responsibility.
- I don't believe this.

833
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:57,696
Another raise wouldn't hurt.

834
01:05:57,775 --> 01:06:00,709
And I'll be spending a lot of time
in my car...

835
01:06:00,778 --> 01:06:03,245
so I'll probably be needing
a cell phone.

836
01:06:03,347 --> 01:06:05,007
I don't believe this.

837
01:06:05,116 --> 01:06:06,810
Just a little phone?

838
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:17,215
Thank you!

839
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:29,423
Just go ahead and play.

840
01:07:29,496 --> 01:07:32,055
Roll the dice and play.

841
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:36,566
Come on.
Aren't you gonna play?

842
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:38,728
Roll the dice!

843
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,567
Come on.

844
01:07:45,078 --> 01:07:49,810
Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich who's
been snooping around the water board?

845
01:07:49,883 --> 01:07:51,349
Yeah. Who's this?

846
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:53,213
You should watch your step.

847
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:57,244
A young lady like yourself, with three
young children, should think again.

848
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:58,415
Who is this?

849
01:07:59,426 --> 01:08:01,916
Do you understand what I'm saying?

850
01:08:08,435 --> 01:08:09,560
Who was it?

851
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,436
It's okay.

852
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:18,668
I'm not gonna quit 'cause of
one creepy phone call, George.

853
01:08:18,778 --> 01:08:23,544
Come on, Erin. Your job is supposed to
pay your bills, not put you in danger.

854
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:25,277
I'm not in danger.

855
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:28,514
The phone might be tapped,
but that's usual.

856
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:31,181
We've got a dead bolt.
It's not a big deal.

857
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:33,384
You're not out of your league?

858
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,086
See? See?

859
01:08:35,128 --> 01:08:38,290
That's what those arrogant PG&E fucks
want me to think.

860
01:08:38,365 --> 01:08:41,299
- But they're wrong.
- It doesn't have to be so complicated.

861
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:44,268
- There are plenty of jobs out there.
- How would you know?

862
01:08:53,612 --> 01:08:55,875
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

863
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:58,916
If you'd rather I got a job instead of
taking care of your kids, just say so.

864
01:08:58,984 --> 01:09:00,917
- I didn't say that.
- Because I will.

865
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:04,216
And you can start leaving the kids
with the chicken-fat lady again. Okay?

866
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:06,587
I said I'm sorry.
Keep your voice down.

867
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:08,592
Please. I know what these kids
can sleep through.

868
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:10,594
I probably know 'em
better than you.

869
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,176
Hey, Scott,
tell me something.

870
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,179
Does PG&E pay you
to cover their ass...

871
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:32,239
or do you just do it
out of the kindness of your heart?

872
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:35,285
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The fuck you don't.

873
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:37,287
Nobody calls me Pattee.

874
01:09:37,356 --> 01:09:42,383
That sicko that called the other night
could've only found about me from you.

875
01:09:42,461 --> 01:09:44,189
People are dying, Scott.

876
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:48,061
You've got document after document
right under your nose that says why...

877
01:09:48,133 --> 01:09:50,623
and you haven't said
one word about it.

878
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:54,896
I wanna know how the hell
you sleep at night.

879
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,952
I'm about to drive off the road,
I'm so tired. Keep me awake, will ya?

880
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:22,293
What do you want, a joke?

881
01:10:22,368 --> 01:10:25,666
No, I don't want a joke.

882
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:28,672
Tell me about your day.
What went on back there?

883
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:33,439
Come to think of it,
we had a pretty big event around here.

884
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:37,109
Beth...

885
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:38,648
started talking.

886
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:42,251
What?

887
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:45,384
Beth? My Beth?

888
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:47,390
We were all sitting around
at lunch...

889
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:50,490
and she pointed at a ball
and said...

890
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,620
"ball."

891
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:55,632
Right out of the blue.

892
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,094
It was pretty intense...

893
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,605
you know,
seeing somebody's first word.

894
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:07,269
All the words they say in their life,
the first word she says is "ball."

895
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:13,074
She was pointing
her little finger...

896
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:16,552
with her beautiful, soft,
chubby little arm...

897
01:11:16,622 --> 01:11:18,088
and her little cheeks...

898
01:11:18,157 --> 01:11:21,489
She was looking at it like she'd been
looking at it for nine months...

899
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,687
and just couldn't get it out
but knowing what it was.

900
01:11:24,763 --> 01:11:27,026
She didn't look away or anything.

901
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:29,794
She was just sitting there
with her arm out.

902
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,768
You should've seen
Matthew and Katie and me.

903
01:11:32,838 --> 01:11:35,772
Our jaws just dropped,
and we were looking at her.

904
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:38,900
We must've stood there three or four
minutes and just looked at her.

905
01:11:39,011 --> 01:11:42,275
And she just had her arm out
like that. "Ball."

906
01:11:42,348 --> 01:11:45,282
And, you know, her little lips
wrapped around her...

907
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:49,986
It was great.
It was intense.

908
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:01,020
I brought some stuff that I thought
you guys might be interested in seeing.

909
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,626
My name's Erin,
and I'll be here all day.

910
01:12:04,703 --> 01:12:08,103
Let's go over to these nice ladies.
Hi. How are you?

911
01:12:08,173 --> 01:12:11,141
My name is Erin, and I've brought
some information today...

912
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,143
if you want to look at it.

913
01:12:13,212 --> 01:12:15,372
Any questions,
please let me know.

914
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,948
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Ed Masry.

915
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:22,486
I'm a lawyer involved in the case.
I thought you might like to read these.

916
01:12:22,554 --> 01:12:25,317
- Any questions, I'll be here all day.
- Sounds good.

917
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:26,789
Thanks so much.

918
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:29,793
You got your phone number
in this?

919
01:12:30,728 --> 01:12:33,890
There's more important information
in there than that, trust me.

920
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,632
I'm bored.
So are the kids.

921
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:41,262
Okay, well,
I'm a little busy here, honey.

922
01:12:41,339 --> 01:12:44,273
We invited all these people here.
Ed and I have to... I'm sorry.

923
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:47,673
You know what? I have an idea.
Please. I have an idea.

924
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:49,234
Can you take her?

925
01:12:49,347 --> 01:12:52,281
She's getting heavy, and I can do
my work faster if you take her.

926
01:12:58,956 --> 01:13:01,856
Sugar sleepin'
on two feather pillows

927
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:03,552
Sleepin'
on two feather pillows

928
01:13:03,628 --> 01:13:05,094
Got a need for me?

929
01:13:06,464 --> 01:13:08,761
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetness.

930
01:13:08,833 --> 01:13:10,732
- Guess what.
- What?

931
01:13:10,802 --> 01:13:12,735
I would like to go home.

932
01:13:12,804 --> 01:13:15,897
- Get anything done?
- I got a lot of work done.

933
01:13:15,973 --> 01:13:18,065
I think I ate three watermelons.

934
01:13:18,176 --> 01:13:19,335
Piggyback!

935
01:13:19,444 --> 01:13:20,933
Let's go, brother.
Get on.

936
01:13:21,045 --> 01:13:22,671
Careful, careful.

937
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,440
Here, get on me now.

938
01:13:24,515 --> 01:13:26,778
- Erin, excuse me.
- Oh, hi.

939
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:28,283
This is Nelson Perez.

940
01:13:28,352 --> 01:13:31,286
- He works at the compressor station.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

941
01:13:31,355 --> 01:13:32,685
PG&E.

942
01:13:32,757 --> 01:13:34,690
Oh, hi. Wow.

943
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:37,793
- I've come at a bad time.
- No, no.

944
01:13:37,862 --> 01:13:40,091
Can you just give me one...

945
01:13:40,164 --> 01:13:43,360
- Of course. Sure.
- Thank you. Thank you.

946
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:44,900
Oh, my God.

947
01:13:46,037 --> 01:13:47,936
You know what?

948
01:13:48,005 --> 01:13:49,995
You guys go ahead without me...

949
01:13:50,107 --> 01:13:52,040
and I'll get a ride with Ed...

950
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:54,668
Sweetie, I'll be right behind.

951
01:13:54,779 --> 01:13:56,939
I'll be right behind you.
Okay?

952
01:13:57,048 --> 01:14:00,039
- I really... This is so...
- Fine. Go, go, go.

953
01:14:05,323 --> 01:14:06,949
Get down, bud.

954
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:11,054
We're gonna go home.
All right?

955
01:14:11,128 --> 01:14:12,924
Hang on tight there.

956
01:14:12,997 --> 01:14:15,931
Help your sister with her shoes.
Come on. Let's go.

957
01:14:31,883 --> 01:14:35,818
Mr. Perez, this is so helpful.
May I write some of this down?

958
01:14:35,887 --> 01:14:37,319
I have so many questions.

959
01:14:37,388 --> 01:14:41,847
I wanna know how the plant works,
the cooling towers, everything.

960
01:14:41,926 --> 01:14:42,289
They used the hexachrome here
in these cooling towers...

961
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:45,226
They used the hexachrome here
in these cooling towers...

962
01:14:45,296 --> 01:14:47,263
as an anticorrosive.

963
01:14:47,331 --> 01:14:50,493
Then they dumped the excess water
into these ponds.

964
01:14:50,568 --> 01:14:53,627
I don't remember
seeing any ponds up there.

965
01:14:53,704 --> 01:14:55,933
This is an old picture.
They've been covered over.

966
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,600
And not too carefully, because
if you dig one inch under the surface...

967
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:01,939
the dirt's as green
as a fuckin' shamrock.

968
01:15:02,013 --> 01:15:04,572
And that's what caused
the contamination?

969
01:15:04,682 --> 01:15:08,674
Well, it didn't help, but no.
The problem started on the bottom.

970
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:10,686
According to...

971
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:14,485
this...

972
01:15:14,525 --> 01:15:17,493
in most cases
you would line these ponds...

973
01:15:17,528 --> 01:15:19,859
so this shit didn't seep
into the ground.

974
01:15:19,931 --> 01:15:22,899
- But guess what.
- They skipped that step?

975
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:26,193
And here are the ponds.

976
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,432
The plume comes down like this,
and Hinkley is down here.

977
01:15:29,507 --> 01:15:33,135
It's, like, 14 years of hexachrome
just flowing into the ground water.

978
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:34,608
Jesus.

979
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:38,780
And this guy
just offered all this information?

980
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:40,110
Well, yeah.

981
01:15:40,184 --> 01:15:42,208
Nelson cares
what's in those ponds.

982
01:15:42,286 --> 01:15:46,085
He used to spend half the day wading
around in them... that was his job.

983
01:15:46,157 --> 01:15:47,555
Shit.

984
01:15:54,565 --> 01:15:55,895
What's the matter?

985
01:15:58,202 --> 01:16:01,364
I don't know
if we can pull this off.

986
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:03,372
This is a monster case.

987
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:05,908
We're up to 411 plaintiffs.

988
01:16:05,977 --> 01:16:10,936
We've taken 162 declarations.

989
01:16:11,048 --> 01:16:14,608
Probably hundreds more out there
have moved away.

990
01:16:14,684 --> 01:16:17,618
We're gonna have to find 'em.
It's taking time, manpower.

991
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:21,486
Money's going out, nothing's coming in.
I'll have to take out a second mortgage.

992
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:23,821
- So?
- "So"?

993
01:16:24,961 --> 01:16:27,053
So...

994
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:29,393
I have to tell you...

995
01:16:29,466 --> 01:16:32,491
I've been making inquiries...

996
01:16:32,569 --> 01:16:34,900
with other firms,
bigger firms...

997
01:16:34,971 --> 01:16:37,268
to share some of the cost.

998
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:40,274
They all said no,
said we don't have it.

999
01:16:41,778 --> 01:16:43,836
Bullshit.
We got PG&E by the balls.

1000
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:45,880
PG&E Hinkley by the balls.

1001
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:49,315
But nobody'll get rich unless we can pin
this on PG&E Corporate in San Francisco.

1002
01:16:49,386 --> 01:16:50,647
What do you mean?

1003
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,018
PG&E Corporate claims they had no way
of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

1004
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,216
Oh, they knew.
They had to know.

1005
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:59,226
Show me the document
that proves it.

1006
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:03,464
Then they didn't know,
and if they didn't know...

1007
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:05,466
we can't hit them
with punitive damages.

1008
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:10,471
Punitive damages means a sum
that can actually have some effect...

1009
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:12,540
on these people's lives.

1010
01:17:13,977 --> 01:17:15,910
So what do we do now?

1011
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,683
Let's assume there are documents...

1012
01:17:22,752 --> 01:17:24,946
connecting PG&E Hinkley
with PG&E Corporate...

1013
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:26,954
and they know
these documents exist.

1014
01:17:27,023 --> 01:17:31,982
We take our 400-or-so plaintiffs
and everything you've dug up...

1015
01:17:32,062 --> 01:17:34,996
we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction...

1016
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:38,864
see if they offer a reasonable amount
or just throw more paper at us.

1017
01:17:38,935 --> 01:17:40,868
That sounds great.
Let's do that.

1018
01:17:40,937 --> 01:17:42,369
There's a downside.

1019
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:46,140
PG&E will submit a demurrer...

1020
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:48,676
a list of reasons
attacking each complaint...

1021
01:17:48,745 --> 01:17:51,679
claiming that each cause of action
has no merit.

1022
01:17:51,748 --> 01:17:55,478
If the judge agrees with them,
he'll dismiss our case...

1023
01:17:55,552 --> 01:17:57,678
PG&E will have no reason
to settle...

1024
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:00,421
and it's all over.

1025
01:18:06,162 --> 01:18:09,528
So, basically,
it all comes down to...

1026
01:18:09,599 --> 01:18:11,998
what this one judge decides.

1027
01:18:12,969 --> 01:18:14,697
Basically, yeah.

1028
01:18:15,705 --> 01:18:17,137
Jesus.

1029
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:04,785
I'd gotten so used to
having them come up benign.

1030
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:08,322
Guess I just didn't expect it.

1031
01:19:10,393 --> 01:19:13,828
Sure wish I would have had longer
to get used to the idea.

1032
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,557
You think if you've got
no uterus...

1033
01:19:20,637 --> 01:19:23,070
and no breasts...

1034
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:26,141
you're still
technically a woman?

1035
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,734
Sure you are.

1036
01:19:29,846 --> 01:19:31,779
Yeah, you're just...

1037
01:19:31,848 --> 01:19:34,714
you're actually
a happier woman...

1038
01:19:34,784 --> 01:19:37,911
because you don't have to worry
about maxi pads and underwire.

1039
01:19:44,994 --> 01:19:47,257
We're gonna get them, Erin,
aren't we?

1040
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,765
You gotta promise me
that we're gonna get them.

1041
01:19:53,802 --> 01:19:55,166
Yeah.

1042
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:09,942
All right,
I have before me a complaint...

1043
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:12,850
on behalf of the residents of Hinkley...

1044
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:16,412
who have filed this lawsuit
against Pacific Gas and Electric...

1045
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:20,452
for damages, medical expenses
and personal trauma...

1046
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:23,827
due to contamination
of the ground water in their area...

1047
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:25,364
by the defendant.

1048
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:28,459
And I have here
84 motions to strike...

1049
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:31,835
and demurrers
submitted by representatives...

1050
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,463
of Pacific Gas and Electric...

1051
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:36,907
each one attacking
the validity of this complaint.

1052
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:41,148
I have reviewed
all of the information carefully.

1053
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,740
I'm ready to give my decision.

1054
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,912
Before I do, is there anything
anyone wants to say?

1055
01:20:47,756 --> 01:20:49,689
No, Your Honor.

1056
01:20:51,627 --> 01:20:53,116
Very well.

1057
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:55,287
In the matter of the Plaintiffs
of Hinkley, California...

1058
01:20:55,364 --> 01:20:57,991
versus Pacific Gas and Electric...

1059
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,090
it is the order of this court...

1060
01:21:00,168 --> 01:21:03,603
that each of the 84 motions to strike
and demurrers...

1061
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:06,070
are denied...

1062
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:10,338
and the causes of action against
Pacific Gas and Electric are upheld.

1063
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,705
On a more personal note...

1064
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:17,376
as a resident here in Barstow,
which is not far from Hinkley...

1065
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:21,717
I am disturbed
by reference to evidence...

1066
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:25,281
that suggests that not only
was hexavalent chromium used...

1067
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,956
but that your clients actually
sent these residents pamphlets...

1068
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,125
telling them
that it was good for them.

1069
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:36,532
Tell your clients
they're going to trial.

1070
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:51,450
Jesus.
They look like the Secret Service.

1071
01:21:52,187 --> 01:21:53,619
Intimidation.

1072
01:21:55,657 --> 01:21:58,056
Let the games begin.

1073
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:00,389
Show them into the conference room.

1074
01:22:02,564 --> 01:22:04,497
Donald. Anna.

1075
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:08,000
I want to talk to you
for a minute.

1076
01:22:12,274 --> 01:22:13,865
Counselors.

1077
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,511
Let's be honest here.

1078
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:27,577
Twenty million dollars is more money
than these people have ever dreamed of.

1079
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:30,623
See, now that pisses me off.

1080
01:22:31,259 --> 01:22:35,160
First of all, since the demurrer
we have more than 400 plaintiffs.

1081
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,857
Let's be honest.
We all know there are more out there.

1082
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:41,333
They may not be the most sophisticated
people, but they do know how to divide.

1083
01:22:41,403 --> 01:22:44,735
Twenty million dollars isn't shit
when you split it between them.

1084
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,933
Second of all, these people
don't dream about being rich.

1085
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:51,478
They dream about being able to
watch their kids swim in a pool...

1086
01:22:51,546 --> 01:22:54,810
without worrying that they'll have to
have a hysterectomy at the age of 20...

1087
01:22:54,883 --> 01:22:56,816
like Rosa Diaz,
a client of ours...

1088
01:22:56,885 --> 01:23:01,685
or have their spine deteriorate
like Stan Bloom, another client of ours.

1089
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:05,817
So before you come back here
with another lame-ass offer...

1090
01:23:05,894 --> 01:23:09,852
I want you to think real hard about
what your spine is worth, Mr. Walker...

1091
01:23:09,931 --> 01:23:13,457
or what you might expect someone
to pay you for your uterus, Ms. Sanchez.

1092
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:15,627
Then you take out your calculator...

1093
01:23:15,704 --> 01:23:17,898
and you multiply that number
by 100.

1094
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:21,304
Anything less than that
is a waste of our time.

1095
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:26,845
By the way, we had the water
brought in special for you folks.

1096
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:28,141
Came from a well in Hinkley.

1097
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:46,832
I think this meeting's over.

1098
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,925
Damn right it is.

1099
01:24:26,307 --> 01:24:30,072
Fuck, George, did a bomb blow up?
You letting the kids run wild?

1100
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:41,982
What's that?

1101
01:24:52,032 --> 01:24:54,465
I saw 'em in a mall one day.

1102
01:24:55,636 --> 01:24:57,762
I said, " Damn...

1103
01:24:57,872 --> 01:25:00,806
those would look good
on those beautiful ears."

1104
01:25:02,476 --> 01:25:05,638
So I bought 'em and said, " Next time
Erin does or says something nice...

1105
01:25:05,713 --> 01:25:07,646
I'll surprise her with 'em."

1106
01:25:09,116 --> 01:25:11,549
You know how long ago that was?

1107
01:25:13,654 --> 01:25:15,086
Six months ago.

1108
01:25:17,324 --> 01:25:18,255
I'm sorry...

1109
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:20,918
And so what I'm thinking is...

1110
01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:28,362
either you gotta find a different job
or a different guy.

1111
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:34,940
There may be many men
out there...

1112
01:25:35,009 --> 01:25:38,273
who don't mind being the maid
and getting nothing in return...

1113
01:25:38,345 --> 01:25:41,279
but I sure as shit
ain't one of'em.

1114
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:44,449
I can't leave my job, George.

1115
01:25:44,518 --> 01:25:46,781
Yes, you can.

1116
01:25:46,854 --> 01:25:49,947
You can just quit.
People do it all the time.

1117
01:25:50,024 --> 01:25:52,457
How can you ask me to do that?

1118
01:25:53,761 --> 01:25:55,193
This job...

1119
01:25:57,164 --> 01:26:01,429
For the first time in my life
I've got people respecting me.

1120
01:26:01,502 --> 01:26:03,093
Up in Hinkley...

1121
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:07,606
I walk into a room and everyone shuts up
to hear if I've got something to say.

1122
01:26:07,675 --> 01:26:10,165
I never had that before.
Ever.

1123
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:13,842
Please don't ask me
to give it up.

1124
01:26:13,914 --> 01:26:16,814
What about what your kids
are giving up?

1125
01:26:16,884 --> 01:26:20,250
I'm doing more for my kids now
than I did living with my parents.

1126
01:26:20,321 --> 01:26:22,254
One day they'll understand that.

1127
01:26:22,323 --> 01:26:25,155
- Well, what about me?
- What about you?

1128
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:32,364
You think either one of the men
who gave me those children...

1129
01:26:32,433 --> 01:26:35,367
asked me what I wanted
before he walked away?

1130
01:26:35,436 --> 01:26:41,374
All I've ever done is bend my life
around what men decide they need.

1131
01:26:41,442 --> 01:26:44,774
Well, not now.
I'm sorry. I won't do it.

1132
01:26:44,845 --> 01:26:46,812
Well...

1133
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,608
Erin, I'm not them.

1134
01:26:49,883 --> 01:26:53,283
What more do I have to do
to prove that to you?

1135
01:26:53,354 --> 01:26:54,718
Stay.

1136
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:12,204
What for?

1137
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,872
Hmm?

1138
01:27:14,942 --> 01:27:16,465
You got a raise.

1139
01:27:16,577 --> 01:27:19,010
You can afford day care.
You don't need me.

1140
01:28:15,542 --> 01:28:16,974
Thank you.

1141
01:28:20,913 --> 01:28:22,777
We can get them, Pamela.

1142
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,407
We can.

1143
01:28:26,352 --> 01:28:28,683
I don't want to feel it
all over again...

1144
01:28:28,755 --> 01:28:31,689
and then not have it
come out right.

1145
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:36,552
I don't know
if I could handle that.

1146
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:39,153
Put the kids through that.

1147
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:41,165
The thing is,
it doesn't matter...

1148
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:43,667
whether you win,
lose or draw here.

1149
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:48,172
You were lied to. You and your kids
are sick because of those lies.

1150
01:28:51,143 --> 01:28:54,077
And for no other reason,
you all have to come together...

1151
01:28:54,146 --> 01:28:57,080
to stand up in a courtroom
and say that.

1152
01:29:02,788 --> 01:29:06,245
I'd bring the kids
into the hospital...

1153
01:29:06,324 --> 01:29:09,258
with towels soaked
from their nosebleeds.

1154
01:29:12,964 --> 01:29:14,396
They called County Services...

1155
01:29:14,466 --> 01:29:17,957
'cause they assumed
the kids were being abused.

1156
01:29:22,573 --> 01:29:26,030
Am I gonna get the best behavior
I was talking about earlier?

1157
01:29:27,578 --> 01:29:31,343
What's with the attitude?
I just need cool, I need quiet.

1158
01:29:31,415 --> 01:29:32,938
Okay?

1159
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:35,609
Hello?
Am I alone in the car? Yes?

1160
01:29:35,686 --> 01:29:39,246
I said we'll see.
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

1161
01:29:39,323 --> 01:29:42,223
- All the other moms gave permission.
- I don't care.

1162
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:44,760
When can I get
a freakin' answer?

1163
01:29:44,829 --> 01:29:46,762
Don't talk to me like that.

1164
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:49,765
- Randy's mom said ""yes"" right away.
- Goddamn it, Matthew!

1165
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:52,768
Randy's mom doesn't work,
and Randy's dad did not leave her.

1166
01:29:52,837 --> 01:29:57,364
Figuring out who can take who to roller
hockey is easier at Randy's house.

1167
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,565
Now cool it.

1168
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:06,714
I'll be as quick as I can.
Matthew, can you watch your sister?

1169
01:30:08,718 --> 01:30:10,878
All right, fine.
Come here, Beth.

1170
01:30:10,954 --> 01:30:14,389
- Can I come with you?
- No, baby, I'll just be a second.

1171
01:30:43,452 --> 01:30:46,386
You can't fight a war
without ammunition, can you?

1172
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:52,892
Thank you. I'm only sorry
you didn't get to meet Erin.

1173
01:30:52,961 --> 01:30:56,123
Well, I will. We have
a lot of work to do together.

1174
01:30:56,198 --> 01:30:58,131
Okay.
Well, thanks for coming over.

1175
01:30:58,199 --> 01:31:00,132
Erin, I was just
talking about you.

1176
01:31:00,201 --> 01:31:03,294
This is our new partner, Kurt Potter.
He'll be handling Hinkley now.

1177
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:06,339
Oh, I see what you mean
about a secret weapon.

1178
01:31:06,407 --> 01:31:09,842
Erin, it's great to meet you.
You've done a fabulous job.

1179
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:13,038
- I'll be seeing you.
- Thanks. I appreciate your coming over.

1180
01:31:25,226 --> 01:31:26,317
What?

1181
01:31:26,394 --> 01:31:30,557
Our new partner? When was I gonna hear
about this, in the monthly newsletter?

1182
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:34,759
Hey, just listen. Did I ever
tell you about that airline case?

1183
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:37,063
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1184
01:31:37,137 --> 01:31:40,105
A few years back
I was trying this airline case.

1185
01:31:40,173 --> 01:31:44,802
I got my ass kicked by this guy.
He just buried me in paper. Brutal.

1186
01:31:44,911 --> 01:31:47,378
Toughest mother
I'd ever been up against.

1187
01:31:47,447 --> 01:31:51,280
-Jesus, make a point!
- It was Kurt Potter.

1188
01:31:51,351 --> 01:31:56,617
When we got the PG&E decision, I asked
him to partner. He didn't hesitate.

1189
01:31:56,690 --> 01:31:59,522
Of course he wouldn't hesitate now.
We did all the fucking work.

1190
01:31:59,593 --> 01:32:00,889
Where was he before?

1191
01:32:00,961 --> 01:32:04,896
It doesn't matter. Erin, listen to me.
You want to win this?

1192
01:32:04,964 --> 01:32:09,127
He just gave me this check.
It covers all our expenses to date.

1193
01:32:09,201 --> 01:32:12,727
He's got more toxic tort experience
than anyone in this state.

1194
01:32:12,838 --> 01:32:14,270
This is good news.

1195
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,273
By the way,
I got Pamela Duncan.

1196
01:32:32,424 --> 01:32:35,119
I wanna open it, Mommy.

1197
01:32:35,193 --> 01:32:39,219
You wanna open the can for Mommy?
Well, here, I'll help you.

1198
01:32:39,297 --> 01:32:40,888
Can you turn it?

1199
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:44,457
Hi, George.

1200
01:32:44,569 --> 01:32:45,626
Let's go see.

1201
01:32:45,737 --> 01:32:48,170
Let's go see if it's George.

1202
01:33:11,728 --> 01:33:13,194
Erin Brockovich?

1203
01:33:13,263 --> 01:33:15,696
- Yeah.
- Package from Masry and Vititoe.

1204
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:28,767
Thank you.

1205
01:33:30,914 --> 01:33:32,540
Let's see what's in here.

1206
01:33:32,616 --> 01:33:34,583
- What's in here?
- Baby.

1207
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,414
There's no baby in here.

1208
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,454
- What is it?
- A dolly.

1209
01:33:39,523 --> 01:33:40,716
It's a dolly?

1210
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:41,847
It's--

1211
01:33:54,937 --> 01:33:56,130
Lookit.

1212
01:33:58,674 --> 01:34:00,231
"" Lookit"" is right.

1213
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,581
Do you see that?

1214
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:16,683
- I want that.
- I want that too.

1215
01:34:16,758 --> 01:34:18,691
It's our lucky day.

1216
01:34:30,939 --> 01:34:34,567
PG&E has requested that we submit
to binding arbitration.

1217
01:34:34,642 --> 01:34:36,541
What's that?

1218
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:41,714
That's where we try the case
without a jury, just before a judge.

1219
01:34:41,816 --> 01:34:46,548
It's called a test trial. The judge's
decision is final. There's no appeal.

1220
01:34:47,488 --> 01:34:50,923
- How many plaintiffs do you have?
- Six hundred and thirty-four.

1221
01:34:51,759 --> 01:34:54,352
They'll never try that many
all at once.

1222
01:34:54,428 --> 01:34:58,022
So we need to get them together
in groups of 20 or 30--

1223
01:34:58,132 --> 01:35:01,225
worst cases, the most life-threatened,
the sickest in the first group...

1224
01:35:01,335 --> 01:35:03,268
and so on and so on.

1225
01:35:03,337 --> 01:35:06,669
Each one gets to go before a judge
to determine damages.

1226
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,105
PG&E has proposed
that they are liable...

1227
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:13,077
anywhere between
50 and 400 million.

1228
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:17,349
Wait a minute.
Let me just get this straight.

1229
01:35:17,416 --> 01:35:21,249
If we went to trial, PG&E could
stretch this over ten years...

1230
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,980
with appeal after appeal.

1231
01:35:23,055 --> 01:35:26,080
- Those people in Hinkley--
- These people are expecting a trial.

1232
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:30,720
That's what we told them, you and me.
They won't understand this.

1233
01:35:32,832 --> 01:35:35,425
Kurt thinks
it's the best way to go.

1234
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:49,339
Look, I promise you that
we'll be very sensitive on this point.

1235
01:35:49,415 --> 01:35:51,575
We'll make sure they understand...

1236
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:55,983
that this is the only way
that we can go forward at this time.

1237
01:35:56,054 --> 01:35:58,317
But we have
a lot of work to do...

1238
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:01,984
before we even
broach that subject.

1239
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,785
Why don't I take Erin down the hall
so we can start on this stuff...

1240
01:36:06,898 --> 01:36:09,730
and I'll fill her in
on the rest of the details.

1241
01:36:10,802 --> 01:36:14,737
- Those are my files.
- Yeah. We had them couriered over.

1242
01:36:14,806 --> 01:36:17,205
And listen, good work.
They're a great start.

1243
01:36:17,275 --> 01:36:21,040
We'll just have to spend some time
filling in the holes in your research.

1244
01:36:21,112 --> 01:36:23,739
Excuse me--
Theresa, is it?

1245
01:36:23,814 --> 01:36:26,077
There are no holes
in my research.

1246
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:29,880
No offense. Some things we need
you probably didn't know to ask.

1247
01:36:29,954 --> 01:36:32,319
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

1248
01:36:32,389 --> 01:36:35,323
I may not have a law degree,
but I've spent 1 8 months on this case...

1249
01:36:35,392 --> 01:36:38,656
and I know more about these plaintiffs
than you ever will.

1250
01:36:39,997 --> 01:36:42,226
You don't even have phone numbers
for some of them.

1251
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:44,698
- Whose number do you need?
- Everyone's.

1252
01:36:44,768 --> 01:36:47,531
We need to be able to
contact the plaintiffs.

1253
01:36:47,605 --> 01:36:50,004
I said,
whose number do you need?

1254
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:53,766
You don't know 600 plaintiffs'
numbers by heart.

1255
01:37:08,091 --> 01:37:09,557
Annabelle Daniels.

1256
01:37:09,626 --> 01:37:14,324
Annabelle Daniels.
7 1 4-454-9346.

1257
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:17,557
Ten years old, eleven in May.
Lived on the plume since birth.

1258
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:22,296
Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer, so
she spent every minute in the PG&E pool.

1259
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:25,807
A tumor on her brain stem
was operated on on Thanksgiving...

1260
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:27,808
shrunk with radiation after that.

1261
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:30,867
Her parents are Ted and Rita.
Ted's got Crohn's disease.

1262
01:37:30,946 --> 01:37:34,972
Rita has chronic headaches and nausea
and underwent a hysterectomy last fall.

1263
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:36,380
Ted grew up in Hinkley.

1264
01:37:36,451 --> 01:37:39,351
His brother Robbie, his wife May
and their five children...

1265
01:37:39,421 --> 01:37:43,516
RobbieJr., Martha, Ed, Rose and Peter
also lived on the plume.

1266
01:37:43,592 --> 01:37:46,059
Their number is 454-95 54.

1267
01:37:46,128 --> 01:37:48,061
You want their diseases?

1268
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:55,631
Look, we got off
on the wrong foot here.

1269
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:59,730
That's all you got, lady--
two wrong feet and fucking ugly shoes.

1270
01:38:05,813 --> 01:38:07,279
She insulted me.

1271
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:09,508
Bullshit.
It was a misunderstanding.

1272
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:12,813
But instead of handling it politely
and treating her with respect--

1273
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,615
Why should I respect her?

1274
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:17,623
Just because she's not supporting 3 kids
with no husband and no education...

1275
01:38:17,692 --> 01:38:19,488
doesn't make her an idiot.

1276
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:21,890
Just because
she dresses like a lawyer...

1277
01:38:21,963 --> 01:38:25,659
doesn't mean she didn't work her ass off
in shit positions to earn her way.

1278
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,666
Excuse me
for not going to law school.

1279
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:31,670
Law school? At this point
I'd settle for charm school.

1280
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,544
Mr. Linwood.

1281
01:38:41,614 --> 01:38:43,046
Oh, God.

1282
01:38:49,622 --> 01:38:51,418
Bob?

1283
01:38:55,762 --> 01:38:58,924
6086 Bridge Road...

1284
01:39:00,433 --> 01:39:02,024
Hinkley, California.

1285
01:39:07,973 --> 01:39:11,408
Okay, now, if you could
walk me through...

1286
01:39:11,477 --> 01:39:13,410
all of the elements of...

1287
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,413
Annabelle's illnesses.

1288
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,849
Specific details.

1289
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:24,820
When the symptoms began
prior to the first medical visit.

1290
01:39:25,991 --> 01:39:29,926
If you could reserve sentimental
embellishments, I'd appreciate it...

1291
01:39:29,995 --> 01:39:32,690
because they're not gonna
help you in court.

1292
01:39:32,765 --> 01:39:36,029
I just need facts, dates, time.

1293
01:39:37,101 --> 01:39:40,263
I know Theresa isn't real warm,
but they say she's a good lawyer.

1294
01:39:40,338 --> 01:39:44,797
She asked the same questions you asked.
I already told you everything.

1295
01:39:44,876 --> 01:39:49,471
I don't want her here again. She's kinda
stuck-up, and she upsets Annabelle.

1296
01:39:49,547 --> 01:39:53,312
Okay, if you don't like Theresa,
that's okay.

1297
01:39:53,384 --> 01:39:55,442
You know how important
Annabelle is to me.

1298
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,646
Ed and I are still here for you.

1299
01:39:57,755 --> 01:40:01,952
I called Ed two days ago, Erin.
He still hasn't called me back.

1300
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,584
Now, I hate to say this, but...

1301
01:40:04,695 --> 01:40:07,288
everyone's pretty upset
about this arbitration thing.

1302
01:40:08,099 --> 01:40:09,565
What?

1303
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:11,895
Pamela's written a letter
in the Hinkley News...

1304
01:40:11,968 --> 01:40:14,401
telling everybody
to get new lawyers...

1305
01:40:14,471 --> 01:40:16,028
that we've been lied to.

1306
01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:17,730
Is it true?

1307
01:40:19,576 --> 01:40:20,940
Did you? Did you?

1308
01:40:21,011 --> 01:40:25,242
I'm telling you the truth,
and I will get to the bottom of this.

1309
01:40:25,315 --> 01:40:26,872
Don't lie to us.

1310
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:30,350
- I'll take care of this, I promise.
- We're trusting you, so--

1311
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,444
Thanks.
I'll talk to you soon.

1312
01:40:32,556 --> 01:40:34,045
All right. Bye-bye.

1313
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:39,857
I'm not saying
it's not a strong case.

1314
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:42,989
If it wasn't a strong case, every
demurrer wouldn't have been dismissed.

1315
01:40:43,065 --> 01:40:44,497
I wouldn't be here.

1316
01:40:44,567 --> 01:40:47,729
What I am saying is,
we still don't have a smoking gun...

1317
01:40:47,803 --> 01:40:49,736
that ties San Francisco
to Hinkley...

1318
01:40:49,805 --> 01:40:53,296
something that proves
that prior to 1 987...

1319
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:56,468
PG&E Corporate
knew the water was bad in Hinkley...

1320
01:40:56,545 --> 01:40:58,307
and did nothing about it.

1321
01:40:59,548 --> 01:41:02,539
Hey, Erin. I thought
you were taking a sick day.

1322
01:41:02,618 --> 01:41:04,050
So did I.

1323
01:41:09,758 --> 01:41:11,384
What's going on in there?

1324
01:41:11,494 --> 01:41:13,961
Meeting about the PG&E thing.

1325
01:41:14,063 --> 01:41:15,654
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

1326
01:41:17,832 --> 01:41:21,267
We can find it,
or we don't have a big win.

1327
01:41:21,336 --> 01:41:24,498
Can I take a brief break here
for a moment?

1328
01:41:24,572 --> 01:41:26,596
I'll be right back.

1329
01:41:28,409 --> 01:41:30,000
What are you doing?

1330
01:41:30,078 --> 01:41:32,944
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna
choke you with that fucking tie.

1331
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:39,644
- You told me you weren't feeling great.
- Oh, that is bullshit!

1332
01:41:39,754 --> 01:41:44,247
If I was on my death bed, if it
helped you, you'd drag me out of it.

1333
01:41:48,362 --> 01:41:50,454
How could you take this
away from me?

1334
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:52,691
- Nobody's taking anything.
- Bullshit!

1335
01:41:52,766 --> 01:41:57,600
You stuck me in Siberia,
dictating to some goddamn steno clerk...

1336
01:41:57,671 --> 01:41:59,604
so you could finish this
without me.

1337
01:41:59,673 --> 01:42:04,200
They screwed up, Erin. Do I have
your attention now? They admit it.

1338
01:42:04,278 --> 01:42:08,213
The arbitration proposal they submitted
could have been written in Sanskrit...

1339
01:42:08,282 --> 01:42:10,181
for all the sense it made
to the people in Hinkley.

1340
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:14,879
I know. I spoke to Ted. Pamela Duncan
wouldn't even get on the phone with me.

1341
01:42:14,988 --> 01:42:19,481
She's got everybody seeing red with that
letter she wrote. She called us thieves.

1342
01:42:19,592 --> 01:42:21,957
- The whole thing is falling apart.
- Why? Why?

1343
01:42:22,028 --> 01:42:25,326
Because before we go to arbitration,
we have to get the plaintiffs to agree.

1344
01:42:25,398 --> 01:42:29,333
- How many?
- Usually they require about 7 0%.

1345
01:42:29,402 --> 01:42:33,167
PG&E is demanding 90.
In other words, everybody.

1346
01:42:33,239 --> 01:42:35,570
Now do you understand?
This is serious.

1347
01:42:35,641 --> 01:42:38,040
And what, Ed?
I'm not serious?

1348
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,339
You're emotional.
You're erratic.

1349
01:42:40,413 --> 01:42:43,609
You say whatever comes into your head.
You make this personal, and it isn't.

1350
01:42:43,683 --> 01:42:45,479
Not personal?

1351
01:42:45,585 --> 01:42:49,645
That is my work, my sweat,
my time away from my kids.

1352
01:42:49,755 --> 01:42:52,689
If that's not personal,
I don't know what is--

1353
01:42:58,763 --> 01:43:00,696
Hey, come on.

1354
01:43:00,765 --> 01:43:02,197
Come on.

1355
01:43:03,268 --> 01:43:05,292
Go home. Get well.

1356
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:08,702
Because you're
no good to me sick.

1357
01:43:08,773 --> 01:43:11,297
I need you. All right?

1358
01:43:11,376 --> 01:43:13,309
This case needs you.

1359
01:43:15,647 --> 01:43:17,580
Did you tell them that?

1360
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:46,975
Binding arbitration isn't
all that different from a trial.

1361
01:43:47,044 --> 01:43:48,908
It's overseen by a judge.

1362
01:43:48,979 --> 01:43:51,412
Evidence is presented
in much the same way.

1363
01:43:51,482 --> 01:43:53,108
Then a jury decides?

1364
01:43:53,217 --> 01:43:55,912
Oh, no, sorry.
I forgot to mention that.

1365
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:58,954
There's no jury
in binding arbitration.

1366
01:43:59,022 --> 01:44:00,545
No jury, no appeals.

1367
01:44:02,325 --> 01:44:05,316
What option do we have
if we don't like the result?

1368
01:44:05,395 --> 01:44:07,624
None.
The judge's decision is final.

1369
01:44:07,697 --> 01:44:11,132
- Not a good answer.
- But we don't think that's a problem.

1370
01:44:12,101 --> 01:44:13,692
As I already told you...

1371
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:17,830
it's definitely between
50 and 400 million dollars.

1372
01:44:17,907 --> 01:44:20,431
Well, which?
There's a big difference there.

1373
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,636
I wouldn't like to speculate
at this point.

1374
01:44:23,913 --> 01:44:26,073
Well, how does it get divided?

1375
01:44:26,182 --> 01:44:27,910
Yeah, who gets what?

1376
01:44:30,519 --> 01:44:35,353
My medical bills started two years ago,
before some of the other people here.

1377
01:44:35,424 --> 01:44:38,824
My daughter has been in and out
of hospitals a lot more than his.

1378
01:44:38,894 --> 01:44:41,157
It shouldn't matter
when it started.

1379
01:44:41,229 --> 01:44:42,889
Just a minute, please.

1380
01:44:42,964 --> 01:44:45,397
People, listen, please.

1381
01:44:45,467 --> 01:44:50,199
Please, the point we have to address
tonight is getting everyone to agree...

1382
01:44:50,272 --> 01:44:52,239
that going binding arbitration...

1383
01:44:52,307 --> 01:44:56,504
is preferable to a trial that could
last ten years before you see any money.

1384
01:44:57,312 --> 01:45:00,678
Maybe some of us
want to wait ten years.

1385
01:45:04,218 --> 01:45:07,675
Everyone has to agree,
or no one has a chance.

1386
01:45:07,788 --> 01:45:11,086
Those of you about to leave,
keep this date in mind--

1387
01:45:11,158 --> 01:45:13,318
1 97 8.

1388
01:45:13,394 --> 01:45:16,658
That's the year
of the Love Canal controversy.

1389
01:45:16,731 --> 01:45:19,324
Those people are still waiting
for their money.

1390
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:22,835
Think about where you'll be
in 1 5 or 20 years.

1391
01:45:29,443 --> 01:45:34,209
Look, everyone, is this a big decision?
Absolutely.

1392
01:45:34,314 --> 01:45:38,306
But I do not believe, and I wouldn't
say this otherwise, this is a sell-out.

1393
01:45:38,418 --> 01:45:41,614
This is the best shot
at getting everyone some money now.

1394
01:45:43,523 --> 01:45:46,252
You and I both know...

1395
01:45:46,326 --> 01:45:50,421
there are people in this room
who can't afford to wait...

1396
01:45:51,297 --> 01:45:53,924
who need to take that chance.

1397
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,763
Are you gonna make them wait?

1398
01:46:02,809 --> 01:46:04,605
So, how many altogether?

1399
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:08,979
Well, we got just about everybody
that came here tonight...

1400
01:46:09,047 --> 01:46:11,606
but that still leaves us
about 1 50 short.

1401
01:46:11,717 --> 01:46:13,149
Oh, shit.

1402
01:46:15,254 --> 01:46:17,687
We'll have to go door-to-door.

1403
01:46:19,691 --> 01:46:22,124
I gotta go pick up my kids.

1404
01:46:25,764 --> 01:46:28,698
- You need a hand with that?
- No, I got it.

1405
01:46:34,406 --> 01:46:35,633
You did good.

1406
01:46:37,176 --> 01:46:38,904
We'll see.

1407
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:40,408
Yeah.

1408
01:47:13,543 --> 01:47:14,975
Thanks for coming.

1409
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:21,779
Don't take 'em anywhere
on your bike, okay?

1410
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:25,116
I'll give you some money for a cab
if you wanna go somewhere.

1411
01:47:25,188 --> 01:47:27,121
I got money.

1412
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:30,124
So how long
is this gonna take?

1413
01:47:32,362 --> 01:47:34,295
I don't know.
A few days.

1414
01:47:35,465 --> 01:47:37,432
Got you your own room.

1415
01:47:49,745 --> 01:47:51,678
I am really sorry, George.

1416
01:47:53,782 --> 01:47:55,248
Have the kids eaten?

1417
01:49:07,487 --> 01:49:09,920
Wanna go get some pancakes?

1418
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:11,923
Let's go.
Everybody up.

1419
01:49:11,992 --> 01:49:14,357
Everybody up today.

1420
01:49:14,428 --> 01:49:16,054
All right.

1421
01:49:16,129 --> 01:49:18,722
- Let's go get some pancakes.
- What time is it?

1422
01:49:18,799 --> 01:49:22,734
It's early. We're gonna take your car
and get some breakfast.

1423
01:49:24,303 --> 01:49:25,894
No, I need my car.

1424
01:49:26,005 --> 01:49:28,234
We'll be back in a minute.

1425
01:49:28,341 --> 01:49:30,274
- Okay.
- Get some sleep.

1426
01:49:31,444 --> 01:49:33,536
Hey, buddy.

1427
01:49:33,613 --> 01:49:36,740
- Put that down. Let's go.
- I'll be there in a minute.

1428
01:49:38,951 --> 01:49:41,384
Let's go eat some pancakes,
girlie.

1429
01:49:41,454 --> 01:49:42,886
Come on.

1430
01:49:52,198 --> 01:49:55,257
Baby, don't play with that.
It took me so long to get it organized.

1431
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:57,766
Will you put that back, please?

1432
01:49:57,836 --> 01:49:59,826
This girl's the same age as me.

1433
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:07,609
She's one of the sick people?

1434
01:50:10,415 --> 01:50:15,374
That's why I'm helping her. We'll get
her some medicine, make her feel better.

1435
01:50:15,453 --> 01:50:18,046
Why can't her own mama
help her?

1436
01:50:21,059 --> 01:50:23,219
Because her own mom's
real sick too.

1437
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:39,908
I'll bring you back some breakfast.

1438
01:50:39,977 --> 01:50:41,375
You want eggs?

1439
01:50:44,415 --> 01:50:46,644
Eggs would be great.

1440
01:50:54,925 --> 01:50:56,858
Eggs would be perfect.

1441
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:08,520
Hey, Matt.

1442
01:52:08,596 --> 01:52:10,586
Erin, how are you?

1443
01:52:13,601 --> 01:52:16,034
- So, been at this all day?
- Yeah.

1444
01:52:16,103 --> 01:52:18,662
- You look tired. You want some coffee?
- I'd love some.

1445
01:52:18,739 --> 01:52:20,706
- I'll make a fresh pot.
- Thanks.

1446
01:52:47,867 --> 01:52:49,766
Don't I know you?

1447
01:52:49,869 --> 01:52:51,165
I don't think so.

1448
01:52:51,237 --> 01:52:54,171
Sure, you were at
the barbecue in Hinkley...

1449
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,867
and at the town meetin'.

1450
01:52:56,943 --> 01:52:58,876
I was watching you.

1451
01:53:00,713 --> 01:53:02,646
I had my eye on you.

1452
01:53:04,951 --> 01:53:06,679
How nice.

1453
01:53:06,753 --> 01:53:10,950
Sure, you were talkin' to everybody
and writin' down a lot of stuff.

1454
01:53:11,023 --> 01:53:13,957
When I saw you
I said to myself...

1455
01:53:14,026 --> 01:53:16,789
""There's something about her.

1456
01:53:16,895 --> 01:53:19,385
I really like that girl.''

1457
01:53:21,099 --> 01:53:24,158
- Matt, can I get that coffee to go?
- Sure thing.

1458
01:53:27,206 --> 01:53:30,140
I feel like
I can talk to you too...

1459
01:53:31,476 --> 01:53:34,967
like you're the type of person
I could say anything to.

1460
01:53:36,648 --> 01:53:38,808
- There you go.
- Great. What do I owe you?

1461
01:53:38,884 --> 01:53:40,817
There's no charge.

1462
01:53:40,885 --> 01:53:42,351
Thanks, Matt.

1463
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:45,217
Well, nice talking to you.

1464
01:53:45,289 --> 01:53:48,223
Would it be important if I told you that
when I worked at the Hinkley plant...

1465
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:50,088
I destroyed documents?

1466
01:53:55,833 --> 01:53:57,390
Maybe.

1467
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:00,736
What was your name?

1468
01:54:00,838 --> 01:54:02,429
Charles Embry.

1469
01:54:05,509 --> 01:54:07,169
Nice to meet you.

1470
01:54:09,347 --> 01:54:13,874
Can you excuse me
for just a quick second?

1471
01:54:28,498 --> 01:54:29,930
Come on.

1472
01:54:31,568 --> 01:54:35,128
Oh, you fucking piece of crap
with no signal!

1473
01:54:35,205 --> 01:54:36,637
Fuck!

1474
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:55,813
Ed! Oh, my God.

1475
01:54:55,891 --> 01:54:58,358
This guy Charles
said he destroyed records.

1476
01:54:58,427 --> 01:54:59,552
He worked at Hinkley.

1477
01:54:59,662 --> 01:55:00,753
Slow down.

1478
01:55:00,863 --> 01:55:03,831
I'm trying to relax,
and this Charles Embry guy--

1479
01:55:03,899 --> 01:55:05,490
- Who?
- Charles Embry.

1480
01:55:05,601 --> 01:55:08,660
First I thought he wanted to kill me.
Then I thought he wanted to pick me up.

1481
01:55:08,737 --> 01:55:12,672
But why would he say that?
Why would he use that as his line?

1482
01:55:14,944 --> 01:55:18,970
Shit. Now go back and see
if he'll make a declaration.

1483
01:55:19,047 --> 01:55:21,173
- A declaration.
- Yeah, but be careful.

1484
01:55:21,249 --> 01:55:22,681
Don't scare him off.

1485
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:26,014
And stay calm.
Stay calm!

1486
01:55:26,087 --> 01:55:29,317
Remember, if it weren't for you,
I'd be in Palm Springs right now.

1487
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:31,983
You're good at
talking people into things.

1488
01:55:32,093 --> 01:55:35,152
Don't pepper him with questions.
Don't do that.

1489
01:55:35,263 --> 01:55:37,093
Just let--

1490
01:55:37,165 --> 01:55:41,225
You know, people want to tell
their story. Just let him talk.

1491
01:55:41,302 --> 01:55:44,202
Let him do all the talking.

1492
01:55:48,609 --> 01:55:50,041
Sorry.

1493
01:55:54,715 --> 01:55:56,648
Would you like another beer?

1494
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,751
My cousin
passed away yesterday.

1495
01:56:10,931 --> 01:56:14,263
He had kidney tumors.
No colon.

1496
01:56:14,334 --> 01:56:16,961
His intestines were eaten away.

1497
01:56:17,037 --> 01:56:18,731
Forty-one years old.

1498
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,831
I remember seeing him
over at the plant.

1499
01:56:22,908 --> 01:56:26,206
He'd be cleaning the cooling towers
wearing one of those--

1500
01:56:26,278 --> 01:56:28,211
What do you call 'em?

1501
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:31,339
- A mask?
- Yeah, yeah, doctor's masks.

1502
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:35,920
It'd be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds.

1503
01:56:49,268 --> 01:56:51,462
I was working in the compressor...

1504
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:55,199
and out of nowhere the supervisor
calls me up to the office and says...

1505
01:56:55,273 --> 01:56:58,708
""We're gonna give you a shredder machine
and send you on down to the warehouse...

1506
01:56:58,777 --> 01:57:01,210
to get rid of the documents
we've got stored there.''

1507
01:57:03,081 --> 01:57:05,071
Did he say why?

1508
01:57:05,917 --> 01:57:07,315
Nope.

1509
01:57:07,385 --> 01:57:09,079
And I didn't ask.

1510
01:57:12,724 --> 01:57:15,658
Did you get a look
at the stuff you destroyed?

1511
01:57:15,727 --> 01:57:18,661
It was a lot of dull stuff--
vacation schedules and the like.

1512
01:57:19,998 --> 01:57:24,024
But then there were a few memos about
the holding ponds, the water in them.

1513
01:57:24,102 --> 01:57:27,298
They had readings
from the test wells...

1514
01:57:27,371 --> 01:57:28,803
stuff like that.

1515
01:57:32,576 --> 01:57:35,271
You were told to destroy those?

1516
01:57:35,345 --> 01:57:36,606
That's right.

1517
01:57:38,749 --> 01:57:41,114
Of course, as it turns out...

1518
01:57:41,185 --> 01:57:44,210
I wasn't a very good employee.

1519
01:58:00,503 --> 01:58:02,333
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

1520
01:58:02,405 --> 01:58:04,998
Ed, Erin, what's this?

1521
01:58:05,842 --> 01:58:08,275
- May I?
- Go ahead.

1522
01:58:08,344 --> 01:58:11,176
Well, you know what,
Mr. Potter?

1523
01:58:11,247 --> 01:58:13,771
We completely forgot
your birthday this year...

1524
01:58:13,850 --> 01:58:18,343
and as you've been so good to me,
it seemed a terrible oversight.

1525
01:58:18,421 --> 01:58:22,652
So what Ed and I have been doing is
putting together a present for you.

1526
01:58:22,758 --> 01:58:24,850
Six hundred and thirty-four.

1527
01:58:24,961 --> 01:58:26,928
They're all signed,
every single one.

1528
01:58:27,797 --> 01:58:30,822
- Holy shit!
- Don't go getting jealous, Theresa.

1529
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:31,991
She's getting jealous.

1530
01:58:32,068 --> 01:58:34,001
We have something for you too.

1531
01:58:34,069 --> 01:58:37,697
Internal PG&E documents
all about the contamination.

1532
01:58:37,772 --> 01:58:39,705
The one that I like best says--

1533
01:58:39,774 --> 01:58:43,766
I'm paraphrasing here, but it says,
Yes, the water's poisonous...

1534
01:58:43,845 --> 01:58:47,644
but it would be better for all involved
to not discuss this with the neighbors.

1535
01:58:47,716 --> 01:58:50,377
It's to the Hinkley station
from PG&E headquarters.

1536
01:58:50,452 --> 01:58:53,352
Stamped "" Received, March 1 966.""

1537
01:58:58,226 --> 01:59:00,557
How did you do this?

1538
01:59:00,629 --> 01:59:04,655
Well, seeing as how I have no brains
or legal expertise...

1539
01:59:04,732 --> 01:59:07,199
and Ed here was losing faith
in the system...

1540
01:59:07,268 --> 01:59:10,202
- No faith.
- I just performed sexual favors.

1541
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:13,068
Six hundred and thirty-four blow jobs
in five days.

1542
01:59:19,446 --> 01:59:21,242
I'm really quite tired.

1543
01:59:22,316 --> 01:59:23,748
Oh, thank you.

1544
01:59:49,642 --> 01:59:52,235
I'm still not sure
why you wanted me to come.

1545
01:59:53,613 --> 01:59:57,207
I want to show you
what you helped to do.

1546
02:00:24,009 --> 02:00:26,203
- How are you feeling today?
- Good.

1547
02:00:26,278 --> 02:00:29,212
- It's a good day.
- Oh, I'm glad.

1548
02:00:29,281 --> 02:00:30,713
Come on in.

1549
02:00:32,117 --> 02:00:34,812
What a nice surprise this is.

1550
02:00:41,526 --> 02:00:46,690
I wanted to come out here
instead of calling...

1551
02:00:46,764 --> 02:00:49,994
because the judge came back
with a number.

1552
02:00:56,607 --> 02:00:59,074
For the whole group, or...

1553
02:00:59,143 --> 02:01:01,167
for us, or--

1554
02:01:01,245 --> 02:01:02,677
Both.

1555
02:01:04,348 --> 02:01:06,440
He's gonna make them pay...

1556
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:09,279
333 million.

1557
02:01:13,524 --> 02:01:15,354
Oh, my God.

1558
02:01:17,394 --> 02:01:21,261
And he's gonna make them give
five million of that to your family.

1559
02:01:22,932 --> 02:01:24,523
Five million dollars?

1560
02:01:29,906 --> 02:01:33,204
I don't even know
how much money that is!

1561
02:01:33,276 --> 02:01:35,038
Well, it's enough...

1562
02:01:35,111 --> 02:01:37,271
for whatever
you could ever need...

1563
02:01:37,347 --> 02:01:41,680
or whatever your girls need
or your girls' girls need.

1564
02:01:41,785 --> 02:01:43,342
It'll be enough.

1565
02:01:43,453 --> 02:01:45,249
Oh, Erin.

1566
02:01:45,288 --> 02:01:46,754
Oh, God.

1567
02:01:49,024 --> 02:01:51,958
Thank you so much.

1568
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:56,763
It's okay.

1569
02:02:01,370 --> 02:02:04,304
I don't know what I would've done
without you.

1570
02:02:05,207 --> 02:02:06,798
It's a good day.

1571
02:02:08,143 --> 02:02:10,076
This is too much!

1572
02:02:20,955 --> 02:02:23,718
Masry and Vititoe.
Can I--

1573
02:02:23,791 --> 02:02:25,223
Shoot.

1574
02:02:28,262 --> 02:02:30,889
I have a delivery for Ed Masry.

1575
02:02:30,965 --> 02:02:33,398
It's the last office
down the corridor on the right.

1576
02:02:33,468 --> 02:02:34,934
Thank you.

1577
02:02:35,002 --> 02:02:37,094
Masry and Vititoe--

1578
02:02:37,171 --> 02:02:41,607
Damn it. Does anyone know
anything about these phones?

1579
02:02:46,314 --> 02:02:48,907
Everybody loves the desk...

1580
02:02:49,016 --> 02:02:50,949
you picked out for me, baby.

1581
02:02:52,552 --> 02:02:56,351
And guess who's on the cover
of Los Angeles Lawyer magazine.

1582
02:02:56,423 --> 02:02:58,356
Talk to you later.
Bye.

1583
02:03:03,196 --> 02:03:05,129
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1584
02:03:19,913 --> 02:03:22,073
I'd rather walk her through this
in person.

1585
02:03:22,182 --> 02:03:26,675
There's some things I want to show her--
visual aides, documents and stuff.

1586
02:03:26,786 --> 02:03:30,221
If you could just tell her
I won't take up too much of her time.

1587
02:03:31,357 --> 02:03:33,449
Right.

1588
02:03:33,526 --> 02:03:37,461
Well, it's a little more complicated
than Hinkley, so let me do that.

1589
02:03:39,532 --> 02:03:42,295
Tell her I'm not a lawyer.
That may help.

1590
02:03:43,369 --> 02:03:44,494
Great.

1591
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:47,834
Why don't you give me the address now,
just in case.

1592
02:03:51,744 --> 02:03:53,404
All right.

1593
02:03:53,512 --> 02:03:55,638
Thanks so much.
Bye.

1594
02:03:55,748 --> 02:03:57,681
What's up?

1595
02:03:58,917 --> 02:04:01,077
I have your bonus check.

1596
02:04:04,722 --> 02:04:07,053
I want you to be prepared...

1597
02:04:07,125 --> 02:04:09,092
because...

1598
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,559
the figure's not exactly
what we discussed.

1599
02:04:15,233 --> 02:04:16,961
Why not?

1600
02:04:17,035 --> 02:04:21,095
Because after careful consideration,
I felt...

1601
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:24,164
that the figure was not...

1602
02:04:24,242 --> 02:04:25,503
appropriate.

1603
02:04:26,945 --> 02:04:28,935
Although you may not agree...

1604
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,574
you have to trust my judgment.

1605
02:04:31,682 --> 02:04:34,616
Trust?
You want me to trust you?

1606
02:04:34,685 --> 02:04:37,653
Do me a favor, Ed. Don't use
big words you don't understand.

1607
02:04:37,721 --> 02:04:40,814
It's a complicated issue, Erin.
You're not a qualified lawyer.

1608
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:44,223
I did a job.
You should reward me accordingly.

1609
02:04:44,294 --> 02:04:48,992
That is the problem. All you lawyers do
is complicate uncomplicated situations.

1610
02:04:49,066 --> 02:04:52,296
Do you know why people think all lawyers
are backstabbing, bloodsucking scumbags?

1611
02:04:52,369 --> 02:04:53,630
Because they are.

1612
02:04:53,704 --> 02:04:57,867
I cannot believe you'd do this when I'm
up to my ass in Kettleman plaintiffs...

1613
02:04:57,941 --> 02:05:00,909
which, by the way, looks like it's gonna
be double the amount we had in Hinkley.

1614
02:05:00,978 --> 02:05:04,777
You expect me to go out there, leave my
kids to be looked after by strangers...

1615
02:05:04,847 --> 02:05:08,782
get these people to trust you with their
lives, and all while you're screwing me.

1616
02:05:10,386 --> 02:05:13,320
I want you to know something, Ed.
It is not about the number.

1617
02:05:13,389 --> 02:05:15,982
It's about the way my work
is valued in this firm.

1618
02:05:16,058 --> 02:05:18,787
It's about how,
no matter what I do, you're not--

1619
02:05:23,966 --> 02:05:25,865
As I was saying...

1620
02:05:25,935 --> 02:05:28,562
I decided that...

1621
02:05:28,638 --> 02:05:31,071
the figure you proposed...

1622
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:33,699
was inappropriate...

1623
02:05:33,809 --> 02:05:35,298
so I increased it.

1624
02:05:46,288 --> 02:05:50,223
Do they teach beauty queens
how to apologize?

1625
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:52,521
Because you suck at it.

1626
02:06:06,408 --> 02:06:10,070
Thank you, Ed.
