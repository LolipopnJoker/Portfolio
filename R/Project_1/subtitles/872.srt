1
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,785
Pearl Harbor outer marker, 30 minutes.

2
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,334
- Hey, Case! What's happening?
- Tackman, how you doing?

3
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,544
Where's your whites?
The prez is coming.

4
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,213
He won't miss me.

5
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:33,217
What's this? You're in the Navy,
you've got to look good. There we go.

6
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,719
- Cue Ball!
- Where's your whites?

7
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,432
- Poor boy doesn't have a dress uniform.
- I've got the dress, I forgot the pumps.

8
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,368
Tell him not to worry.
Everything here is handled.

9
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,954
Oh, my God.

10
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,166
No, no. No, no, no, that's okay.
We'll take care of it.

11
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,879
Well, it's gonna be a zoo.

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,841
- Chief Ryback, captain.
- Yeah, send him in.

13
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,515
Get in your dress uniform.

14
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,810
You know how I feel about ceremonies.
I thought this time...

15
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,271
If I had your ribbons,
I'd wear them to bed.

16
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,647
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,608
Get in your whites.
I'll introduce you to the president.

18
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,279
- I appreciate that, but...
- That's not a good idea.

19
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,782
For once, Commander Krill and I
are in total agreement.

20
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:43,662
I have 50 gallons of bouillabaisse
I need to prepare by tomorrow.

21
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,999
- My birthday?
- I could do the cheeseburger routine.

22
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,129
It's not for me, it's the crew.
They really love that stuff. So we'll do that.

23
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,965
Just don't show your face
until after the ceremony.

24
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,466
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,427
You're a sorry-looking sailor.

26
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,388
That I am, sir. Thank you, sir.

27
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,854
Sir...

28
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,732
Why do you tolerate that clown?

29
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,650
I know he's a good cook...

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,447
He's more than a good cook.
You have no idea. Now let him be, XO.

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,240
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,081
Fifty years ago today...

33
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,543
the infamous Japanese attack
destroyed the Pacific fleet...

34
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,128
here in Pearl Harbor.

35
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,299
Today, in honor of those who lost
their lives, the USS Missouri returns.

36
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,011
Built to avenge Pearl Harbor,
she did.

37
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,722
Days after we dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima...

38
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,683
the Japanese surrendered
on the Missouri's deck...

39
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,268
ending World War II.

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,148
The Missouri fired the first shots
of the Gulf War.

41
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,069
Her powerful 16-inch guns destroyed
Iraqi bunkers.

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,864
Her Tomahawk missiles rocketed deep
into the heart of Baghdad.

43
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,035
The fastest and most powerful
dreadnought ever to sail the seas...

44
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,789
Where's your tattoo?

45
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,124
Where I got it, you don't want to see.

46
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,629
The last battleship left in the world,
BB63, will be decommissioned.

47
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,799
President Bush is paying final tribute
to the ship...

48
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,467
and her great history.

49
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,638
Did you hear the joke when Andre
and Beaudreau went hunting on the bayou?

50
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,059
Where're the guns, Druillet?

51
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,852
That's about right.

52
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,106
In the end this unity of purpose...

53
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,985
These ceremonies not only remember war,
they celebrate peace.

54
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,030
The president ordered the removal
of all Tomahawk cruise missiles...

55
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,740
from U.S. surface ships.

56
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,953
Tomorrow the ship embarks for
San Francisco for her final voyage.

57
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:53,125
Her weaponry will be removed,
dismantled, and never fired again.

58
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,629
The Missouri will then take her place
in naval history.

59
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,259
We will gain the inevitable triumph,
so help us God.

60
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,348
Look at the money spent
on this photo opportunity.

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,352
Ready to get under way, sir.

62
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,731
Very well, let's single up.

63
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,359
Aye, sir.
Single up all lines.

64
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,060
- Captain, you have clear water to port.
- Very well.

65
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,978
No, no, no.

66
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,773
Krill ain't running this ship.

67
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,984
The old man has to okay
all helicopter landings.

68
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,739
How's the captain going to authorize
a surprise party for himself?

69
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,116
We already stowed all the gear.

70
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,411
- What's on this helicopter?
- This little sweetheart.

71
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,625
- Damn. She's in the...?
- Yeah, she's in the cake.

72
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,545
That is Miss July '89. Jordan Tate.

73
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,758
- We'll be ready for her.
- Good. Go ahead and keep that.

74
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,347
Lieutenant, we don't have time
to talk about this now.

75
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,601
No time for the security
of nuclear weapons?

76
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,895
Maybe I'm not being clear.

77
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,690
Any watches not crucial shall be
secured during the party...

78
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,859
including the Marine roving patrol.

79
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,404
We're operating on a skeleton crew.

80
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,822
This is a direct order.

81
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,326
The log will show I consider this unsafe,
and obeyed under protest.

82
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,661
Fine.

83
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,165
- You missed a spot.
- Aye, sir.

84
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,792
Hey, Cue Ball.

85
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,378
- Cue Ball in the house.
- What's up?

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,879
Show me a move!

87
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,173
Turn up the tunes! Turn up the tunes!

88
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,345
Show them some moves, Cue Ball.
Show them the moves.

89
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,180
Go, Cue Ball! Go, Cue Ball, go!

90
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,766
Go, Cue Ball! Go, Cue Ball, go!

91
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,703
That was cute.

92
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,038
Petty Officer Ryback?

93
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,791
- Ensign Taylor.
- Sir.

94
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,295
You don't have to "sir" me.
We're casual in the galley.

95
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,214
I'd watch it.
We still have a week together.

96
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,092
I guess I won't get to see you
go through puberty.

97
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,346
What do you want?

98
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,766
I have orders from the XO
on the captain's birthday.

99
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,603
We're having dinner flown in
from Hawaii.

100
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,189
This galley will be cleared by 1700.

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,902
You and your crew are to assemble
at the mess deck prior to the helo's arrival.

102
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,195
Negative.

103
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,488
Excuse me?

104
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,658
Only I cook for the captain.
You don't like that, talk to him.

105
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,952
I don't believe you get it.

106
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,831
See, this is a surprise party.

107
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,835
No one is going to talk
to the captain about this.

108
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,128
You know something?

109
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,757
He don't like surprises. Neither do I.

110
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,594
Then I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?

111
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,728
There go that little redhead, boss.

112
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,898
I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?

113
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,485
Hey, Ryback, man.
Krill's going to skin you alive.

114
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,072
Why is it that I'm
starting to shake so bad...

115
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,282
and there's this deep fear in me...

116
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:59,287
thinking about Mr. Krill and
the horrible things he'll do to me?

117
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,585
Commander Krill.

118
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,504
Send him in.

119
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,723
You wanted to see me, captain?

120
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,725
Commander Krill...

121
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,688
how'd you expect to land
a helicopter without my authorization?

122
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,067
- It was a mistake to think...
- It was a mistake to try.

123
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,903
Your actions are grossly insubordinate.

124
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,781
I want an explanation. Now.

125
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,619
Admiral Bates wanted to thank you
for how smoothly things went.

126
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,330
He has a surprise for your birthday.

127
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,416
He's flying in from Hawaii.

128
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:50,088
Bates, I see. If the admiral wants a party,
I guess we'll have one.

129
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,384
Let's keep it simple.
Off-duty personnel can attend...

130
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,094
but watches are by the book.

131
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,846
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,556
Captain...

133
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,309
since he wants this to be a surprise...

134
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,811
if you could stay here
till we come for you...

135
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,190
- I'll be engrossed in a novel.
- Very good, sir.

136
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,502
- How's that bouillabaisse? Heads up!
- We'll carry it in. This needs some more.

137
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,843
Excuse me.

138
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,141
If I'm not mistaken...

139
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,354
every one of you has orders
to report to the mess deck...

140
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,314
for the party.

141
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,150
You stand fast.

142
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,572
Everyone else go! Now.

143
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,866
See you at the party, Casey.

144
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,412
You know...

145
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,373
this does look delicious.

146
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,337
It smells like a lard omelet.

147
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,839
I put up with your shit...

148
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,550
because the captain likes
your cooking.

149
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,720
But this time he won't be here
to save you.

150
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,931
Is that right?

151
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,895
Little flavor.

152
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,942
You like that?

153
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,112
- Fucking crazy?
- That's striking an officer!

154
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,822
That's not striking an officer!

155
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,241
That's striking an officer!

156
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,876
- Okay! All right!
- Cuff him and throw him in the brig!

157
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,672
- Throw him in the brig!
- You need the old man's signature.

158
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,048
Good point.

159
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,467
Secure him in the meat locker.

160
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,137
Now! Right now.

161
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,430
Let's go.

162
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:08,101
Now I know why you're a cook.
You hit like a faggot.

163
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,395
Steel.

164
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,400
Private Nash...

165
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,194
- You came on board in Hawaii?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,363
Then you don't know about Ryback.

167
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,827
He is an extreme psychopath.

168
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,247
He hates officers. He hates America.

169
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:33,334
This is the captain's birthday.
I don't want him ruining it.

170
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,337
No one speaks to him or lets him out.

171
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,883
If he tries to escape,
shoot him right here.

172
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,594
I'm counting on you.

173
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,596
Yes, sir.

174
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,973
Let's go.

175
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,529
Another cold day in hell.

176
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,371
It speaks well for the Navy
that we can entertain a ship at sea.

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,207
It's so human.

178
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,751
And I love that. Don't you?

179
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,378
I just hope I don't throw up.

180
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,589
You'll be fine.

181
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,233
I love it. I love it!

182
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,542
Goddamn!

183
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,045
Watch your step there.

184
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,257
- Welcome to the USS Missouri.
- Thanks.

185
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,347
You okay?

186
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,185
Fantastic!

187
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,899
We're quite excited.
We're looking forward to a great time.

188
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,363
God, I love this business!

189
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,283
My future wife.

190
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,702
She's landed.

191
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,788
The Bunny's landed. See you.

192
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,291
Private!

193
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,336
Doesn't it seem strange
that Krill put me in here?

194
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,880
I ain't listening to you.

195
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,548
- Welcome aboard.
- Okay.

196
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,092
- Guys, make a hole.
- Okay.

197
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,721
Don't let them bother you.
Been at sea too long. You okay?

198
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,223
I still feel really queasy.

199
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,977
We'll go to the wardroom,
where you can change.

200
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,522
Let the lady through!

201
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,657
Be careful with the cake.
Make sure the wires are covered.

202
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,659
That's the way it goes.

203
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,787
- Are you lost?
- No, no. Where do you want us?

204
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,748
- Is the band set up?
- Ready to go.

205
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,750
You're over here.

206
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,919
Starboard side, right now.

207
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,383
You'll knock the captain
off his feet. You're beautiful.

208
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,845
- For motion sickness. Take two.
- This will save me.

209
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,222
- What happened to your face?
- Cut myself shaving.

210
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,849
The cake's almost ready.

211
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,562
We have a room for you to change.
You'll be safe from my men.

212
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,856
- I'm gonna put on my party dress.
- All right.

213
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,900
See you later.
Let's go, get in line!

214
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,652
Hey.

215
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,364
Don't worry. You can play
this with your eyes shut.

216
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,831
Private!

217
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,708
Let me out!

218
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:05,296
You follow Krill's orders, you'll
go to the brig! Use your head!

219
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,008
Go get my pies out of the oven!

220
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,560
I must be nuts.

221
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,152
Very sick. Very sick.

222
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,076
We want to give you
a great big welcome...

223
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,706
to the big, big,
beautiful Missouri lounge...

224
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,545
out here in the middle
of the big beautiful Pacific Ocean.

225
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,923
I'm Bad Billy.

226
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:53,386
And these are
the fabulous Bail Jumpers!

227
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,808
I have orders not to talk to you.
Understand? Orders.

228
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,060
You could be held accountable...

229
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,688
keeping me in here like this.

230
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,232
You have to think about that.

231
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,442
Private?

232
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,820
He didn't say
you can't talk to the captain.

233
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,573
Go ask him if he wants me in here.

234
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,119
You little E-1 prick.

235
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,210
Lieutenant, this is absolutely beautiful.

236
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,146
Old man says keep her level.

237
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,732
How about an hors d'oeuvre?

238
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,821
What have we here?

239
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,868
All right. There's the Twinkies.
Where's Miss July?

240
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,453
And there she is.

241
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,122
Miss July 1989.

242
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,917
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, no!

243
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,044
That's not Miss July.

244
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,879
My God, look at him.

245
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,132
Commander Krill.

246
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,225
Welcome to the revolution.

247
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,857
This party will make history.
No wonder he wanted everyone here.

248
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,157
Maybe Krill isn't
such an asshole after all.

249
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,704
That's great. Go get the old man.
He's been waiting on you now.

250
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,541
All right.

251
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,793
Miss July!

252
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,715
Let's go see the old man.

253
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,677
We're going to surprise the captain now.

254
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,722
- Have a good party!
- Come on, dear.

255
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,895
Hey, where's the chief?

256
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,982
In the meat locker until after the party.

257
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,943
It's only like 40 degrees in there.

258
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,445
He'll be fine. He's got a guard.

259
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,447
Yeah?

260
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,410
Krill's a maniac.
Tell the captain he spit in my soup.

261
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,495
You got a fire in here.

262
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,373
Get my pies out of the oven!

263
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,831
Feels good walking around
in these pantyhose.

264
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,003
It's okay. I'm here to escort
the captain to the party.

265
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,339
Aye, commander.

266
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,343
- Commander Krill.
- Send him in.

267
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,682
Krill?

268
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,352
I'm your date tonight, captain.

269
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,076
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

270
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,956
Who is the highest-ranking
officer here?

271
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,833
Who is the highest-ranking officer
in this room?

272
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,503
All right, sir. Stand up.

273
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,880
Stand up and be recognized.

274
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,802
Part the waves there.
Get out of the man's way.

275
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,804
Put a light on the man.

276
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,684
Now, you, sir, are the
highest-ranking officer in this room?

277
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,812
Yes. Operations officer.
Third in command.

278
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,190
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Commander Green.

279
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,737
Get down!

280
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,867
What's going on?

281
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,661
The party's just beginning.

282
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,872
Captain!

283
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,417
Good shot.

284
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,377
Get down! Hands up!

285
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,670
Heads down!

286
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,840
What are you looking at?
On the floor!

287
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,300
Put your head down.

288
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,468
- You gonna be good now, boy?
- Yes, sir.

289
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,554
What is this, a joke?

290
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,139
No joke!

291
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,101
I hear gunfire. What's going on?

292
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,400
It's done.

293
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,241
Four minutes ahead of schedule.
Damn, I'm good.

294
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,368
Come on!

295
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,704
Come on! Move it!

296
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,789
Let's go.

297
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,251
Mother Goose,
the quails are in the nest.

298
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,090
It's just the music.

299
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,261
You got shit for brains.
That's gunfire. Call the bridge.

300
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,890
I don't know who you're talking to.
No one's listening to you.

301
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,642
I ain't asking you to listen to me.

302
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,020
Call the captain. Listen to him.

303
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,438
Oh, Ryback.

304
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,697
Seal it!

305
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,662
Let's move it! Move your feet! Let's go!

306
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,499
- Let's go! Move! Move!
- Move your feet!

307
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,636
Eyes on the man in front of you!

308
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,056
Goddamn it,
that's the last time I'll tell you!

309
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,018
Shit!

310
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,735
Let this be a learning experience.

311
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,947
If you resist, we will kill you
and the man next to you.

312
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,367
Now move out of here
in an orderly fashion.

313
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,121
Now!

314
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,150
What the hell?

315
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,407
Turn around. Hands on your head.

316
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,057
Where is it? Where is it?

317
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,269
Here it is. Here it is.

318
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,314
Listen to the shit
I've had to put up with.

319
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:50,029
Commander Krill has become
increasingly hostile to the crew...

320
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,574
possibly due to anger over
reviews of his performance.

321
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,913
I recommend psychological
evaluation before his next assignment.

322
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,170
Do I look like I need a
psychological evaluation?

323
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,797
Not at all.

324
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,927
I got to change.

325
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,812
Behind your head.

326
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,899
On your toes!

327
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,567
Up against the wall.

328
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,365
XO on the bridge.

329
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,784
Listen up.

330
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,954
Hands on your head and move
to the counter, right now.

331
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:47,044
Your destination is the focsle.
Cooperate and you won't be harmed.

332
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,425
Change of watch.

333
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,306
You've done a good job,
but you're relieved of duty.

334
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,270
Get your hand off that console.

335
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,072
You're a cheeky bastard. Move out!

336
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,453
My God! Bunch of wussies.

337
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,879
The disk, Mr. Pitt.

338
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,300
Guard it with your life.

339
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,093
Of course.

340
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,305
Bring up the layout, if you will.

341
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,894
- We've overridden their systems.
- We control crypto, CIC...

342
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:49,857
engine rooms, boiler rooms,
bridge and all open decks.

343
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,651
We've welded shut the hatches.

344
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,738
A few loose sailors may be berthing...

345
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,991
or they're caught in nonessential
areas and can go nowhere.

346
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,745
- The rest are in the focsle.
- Excellent. Excellent.

347
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,040
Reactivate the weapons systems
if you will, Mr. Pitt.

348
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,291
Mr. Daumer...

349
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:12,421
you may deploy the welding crews
and chop up broadway.

350
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,384
Commander Krill,
you're hereby promoted to captain.

351
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,138
Congratulations. The ship is yours.

352
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,057
The ship is mine.

353
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,810
Thank you, Billy. All right!

354
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,397
- Can we get something to eat in here?!
- Yes, sir.

355
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,983
Get some food!

356
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,990
Krill warned me you were tricky.

357
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,204
I'm not tricky, I'm just freezing.
Something's going on here.

358
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,665
Call the bridge. No one will yell at you.

359
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,292
You're just doing your job.
Check right away.

360
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,087
All right. All right, I'll check in.

361
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,755
That's all.

362
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,674
Do that. And be careful.

363
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,513
'Tis a rare thing.

364
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,225
This is good. It'll work.

365
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,229
Got a call from Private Nash
on guard duty in the kitchen.

366
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,232
- Pitt, pull it up.
- Shit, shit, shit.

367
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,443
That's an unsecured area.
They can access the whole ship.

368
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,487
Ryback.

369
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,489
Ryback?

370
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,742
Ryback. A cook.
A pain-in-the-ass cook.

371
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,327
Give me that.

372
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,539
- Private Nash.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,500
I'm glad you checked in.
I've been with the captain.

374
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,878
Keep Ryback under control
and don't open the door.

375
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,506
- Tell him you're sending relief.
- What?

376
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,302
Tell him you are sending
somebody to relieve him.

377
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:48,016
Stand your station fast.
I'm sending someone to relieve you.

378
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,312
Is everything all right?
We heard what sounded like gunshots.

379
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,649
Gunshots? Oh, that.

380
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,152
Those are party poppers. Firecrackers.

381
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,862
Part of the party.

382
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,573
Stand firm until you're relieved.

383
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,325
- Yes, sir.
- Over and out.

384
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,290
Anything else you didn't tell us?

385
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,835
Any further memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps?

386
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,255
No other memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps.

387
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,467
There's two men. One's locked up.
I'll take care of it.

388
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,469
No, no, no.

389
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:27,931
We'll handle it. Secure the galley.
Send Cates and Ziggs.

390
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,600
This Marine's armed.

391
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,227
We should send more. I'll go.

392
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,855
Don't worry. They're professionals.

393
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,608
They can handle 20 Marines...

394
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,985
and 100 cooks.

395
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,327
You're wrong, Ryback. You're wrong.

396
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,914
- They were party poppers.
- You got shit for brains.

397
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:56,752
I know they brainwashed you,
but you have to question authority.

398
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,712
Trust me, boy.

399
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,007
That's gunfire.
Get me out of here and I'll take care of it.

400
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,970
I'll be relieved in a few minutes,
so just shut up and sit tight.

401
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,516
Something's going on.
Use your head this time.

402
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,601
Do what you got to do. Get me out.

403
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,521
Or when I'm out,
I'll shoot you myself.

404
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,277
Commander Krill?

405
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,281
Is that you?

406
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,622
Get your hands on your head.
Turn around.

407
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,707
Get down on your knees.

408
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,417
Cross your ankles.

409
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,883
Where's the cook?

410
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,593
In the reefer.

411
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,512
Which one?

412
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,295
Son of a bitch!

413
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,409
Cates. Hey, Cates.

414
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,810
- Hey, Pitt.
- Yeah.

415
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,687
We've got an F-18.

416
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,943
Daumer, they're sending an F-18
to look for the chopper.

417
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,490
Heading 315 miles, speed 430,
approximately 8000.

418
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,621
Two-zero-seven, 61 miles now.

419
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,166
Bearing 180.

420
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,002
Heading 330.

421
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,855
Four-thirty. Five thousand now,
into descent.

422
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,858
We're going down now.

423
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,190
Looks like one helo on deck.

424
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,613
Going in for a closer look.

425
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,371
Thirty-one to Missouri, over.

426
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,082
Goodbye!

427
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,253
Are you tracking me?

428
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,504
Negative.

429
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,383
He's locked me up! Mayday.

430
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,313
Welcome to the revolution.

431
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,488
- Better call the office.
- Good idea.

432
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,971
You're in deep kimchi, buddy.

433
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,807
Better have it all
in one sock for this one.

434
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,352
Claims he was a company man
who worked for you.

435
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,896
What's his name?

436
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,772
William Strannix.

437
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,567
Jesus Christ!

438
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,111
Not good.

439
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,488
Not good.

440
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,583
Mr. Breaker...

441
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,295
you better be candid
with us here tonight.

442
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,006
We need answers,
and we need them now.

443
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:05,055
Gentlemen, if any ships or aircraft
approach within 100 miles...

444
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,434
we will kill the crew and retaliate
with everything in the ship's arsenal.

445
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,480
Bill, this is Tom. What's going on?

446
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,689
Hi, Tom.

447
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,317
I have 32 Tomahawks under my thumb...

448
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,153
and all you can do
is alert the media.

449
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,364
You don't have the launch codes.

450
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,782
Let me guess.

451
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,538
5-6-6-0-4-9-9-7-8-0?

452
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,876
This is insane.

453
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,628
Be careful with that word, Tom.

454
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,714
Mr. Strannix,
this is Admiral Bates speaking.

455
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,592
Would you please tell us
why the hell you're doing this.

456
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,802
Hi, admiral.

457
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:48,223
Six months ago, Tom Breaker
canceled Operation Cleopatra.

458
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:53,561
Shortly thereafter, two young men
from Langley tried to cancel me.

459
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,400
You received each man's right forefinger
in the mail, didn't you, Tom?

460
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,528
Tom?

461
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,779
Yes, I did.

462
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,240
Did you expect us
to wait for you to try again?

463
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,908
Look, Bill...

464
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,994
I know things are a little...

465
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,998
- chaotic for you right now.
- Chaotic!

466
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,916
Wake up, Tom!

467
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:20,588
You and I know that chaos and
bedlam are consuming the entire world.

468
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,217
UV rays are only the beginning.
We have an inch of topsoil left.

469
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,177
Topsoil?

470
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:31,224
Sexually transmitted diseases,
depletion of the gene pool.

471
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,892
It adds up to oblivion.

472
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,937
Governments will fall.
Anarchies will reign.

473
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,440
- It's a brave new world.
- Bill?

474
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,192
What are you planning to do?

475
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:46,281
Do you realize that whatever I do
is inevitable? Can we agree on that?

476
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,533
Not necessarily.

477
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,035
There you go.

478
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:54,831
You can't argue with me
or negotiate or attempt a ploy.

479
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,751
You have to reconsider your philosophy.

480
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:02,047
All right, I'm sorry.
Whatever you decide to do is inevitable.

481
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,298
Look at my life.

482
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,802
The life you tried to take.
There was Annapolis, Vietnam, so on.

483
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,306
I missed the '60s,
and I believe if I had been there...

484
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,684
to contribute,
everything would've worked out fine.

485
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,980
Bill, if this is about reliving
the '60s, you can forget it.

486
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,774
The movement is dead.

487
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,484
Hence the name.

488
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,320
Movement. It moves a certain distance,
then it stops.

489
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,824
Revolution gets its name by always
coming back around in your face.

490
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,161
You tried to kill me,
you son of a bitch.

491
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,789
So welcome to the revolution.

492
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,792
There's more to follow. I'll stay in touch.

493
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,297
He's flipped.

494
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,133
He's completely flipped.

495
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,428
I want an inventory of everything
on that ship.

496
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,180
Aye-aye, sir.

497
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,644
General, here's what we know.

498
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:02,774
The threat is verifiable. It is real.
I repeat, it is real.

499
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,778
Shit! You son of a bitch.

500
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,279
Think they believe you?

501
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,783
They believe I'm crazy,
paranoid or something.

502
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,743
I have a harpoon locked on.

503
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,036
Fire when ready.

504
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,297
Pipe down, men! Pipe down.

505
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,300
Missile away.

506
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,850
Missile away.

507
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,518
Oh, boy.

508
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,813
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

509
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,949
Bang! You're dead.

510
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,497
- He's taken out satellite relay.
- What doesn't he want us to see?

511
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,040
He wants to blind us.

512
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,669
It's illogical. We can
follow his movement from Pearl.

513
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,337
You can vector an AWACS.

514
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,008
- Or send E-2C from Nimitz.
- Make it happen.

515
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,969
Wake up the president.

516
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,016
Bring it in.

517
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,394
Keep it coming in.

518
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,024
Cut it fast.
Time is money on this deal.

519
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:32,071
- This better be a competent crew.
- Get your ass up there!

520
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,574
Watch your heads.

521
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,124
Glad I sent you the blueprints.

522
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,379
I have four sections this way,
seven sections this way.

523
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,424
I'll have it cut and up in an hour.

524
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,265
Time is money on this job!

525
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,521
Time is money.

526
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:09,275
This will cut them to the bone.
Right to the bone.

527
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,447
What's that noise?

528
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,491
That's my beloved crew.

529
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,041
Keep trying. Keep pounding.
Someone will hear us.

530
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,407
Shut the music off.

531
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,128
What the hell is going on?

532
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,715
What happened to them?

533
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:04,932
- Who are you and what are you doing here?
- My name is Jordan Tate.

534
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,851
I'm Miss July '89.

535
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,813
I was hired to jump out of the cake...

536
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,400
but I got airsick
on the way here and so...

537
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,111
this guy gave me these pills.

538
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,615
- I guess I fell asleep.
- What kind of bullshit is this?

539
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,493
I am an actress, okay?

540
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,454
I did a Hunter episode
and a Wet 'n Wild video.

541
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:30,083
My agent said I was
going to jump out of the cake.

542
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,668
How many on the chopper?

543
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,711
I don't know.

544
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,256
It was full.
There was a band and caterers.

545
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,466
Where's the crew?

546
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,095
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

547
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,848
You didn't see or hear anything
and don't remember anything?

548
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,893
I've done stupid things in my life...

549
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,813
but believe me,
I don't know anything.

550
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,775
All right, I believe you.

551
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:03,199
So who are you? Are you
a special forces guy or something?

552
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,118
I'm just a cook.

553
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,453
A cook?

554
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,039
Just a lowly, lowly cook.

555
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,042
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

556
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,088
The ship contains 40,000 rounds
of 20mm CWIZ.

557
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,549
Over 1000 16-inch projectiles.

558
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,554
We believe there's 15 harpoon
cruise missiles still aboard...

559
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,180
and 32 Tomahawks.

560
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,474
What kind of Tomahawks?

561
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,476
It's all right. It's okay.

562
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,603
Eight of them are specials.

563
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,065
Nuclear-tipped. 220 kilotons each.

564
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:40,361
Mr. Breaker, would you explain how
this nut could hold a top position...

565
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,321
in an intelligence agency?

566
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,365
Would you answer that?

567
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:49,537
High-level covert operatives
like Strannix are under great stress.

568
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,374
They're creative thinkers who,
by their very nature...

569
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,586
Tom trains everyone
in the CIA who's crazy.

570
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:01,841
All we want to know
is how he got our battleship.

571
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,677
That's his specialty.

572
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,058
North Korea was refitting a sub
to fire antiship missiles...

573
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,643
so we sent Strannix in.

574
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,397
You've been financing
this maniac's private army?

575
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,025
It didn't occur to you
it might become a problem?

576
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,695
Once we realized we had
lost positive control...

577
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:27,950
under Executive Order 136,
we tried to neutralize him. We missed.

578
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,827
Excuse me.

579
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,413
This North Korean sub...

580
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,124
How do you know he sunk it?

581
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,504
Oh, we're positive he sunk it.

582
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,922
Positive.

583
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,059
Roadrunner to Tweety Bird.
Do you read me? Come in.

584
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,603
Tweety Bird to Roadrunner.
We're nearby.

585
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,439
- How's it going?
- Sub's up.

586
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,609
- It's all rock 'n' roll to me.
- Any sign of Wile E. Coyote?

587
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,946
No. Meet at the birdcage.
Roadrunner out.

588
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,073
- You're the Roadrunner?
- Yeah.

589
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,699
Never been caught.

590
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,247
- Problem. Cates and Ziggs are missing.
- Missing?

591
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,041
I've been radioing them for five minutes.
No response.

592
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,460
- The last location?
- The galley.

593
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,839
I told you to send more men.
I told you.

594
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,424
Please don't leave me here alone.

595
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:30,137
Believe me, this is the safest place
you can be. Understand?

596
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,931
No!

597
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,641
Let me out of here!

598
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,690
Let me out!

599
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,318
Do you understand what'll happen
if anybody hears you?

600
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,195
They'll try to kill us.

601
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,115
Now be quiet.

602
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,914
I hate being alone.

603
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,499
Do you hate being dead?

604
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,005
Check it out.

605
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,009
- Clear!
- Clear!

606
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,688
Put those on.

607
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:34,118
Okay, you're coming with me,
you got to be invisible.

608
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:37,580
If you walk by a hatch and see the enemy,
you become the hatch.

609
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:42,001
I'm giving you this rifle
with a selector switch on it.

610
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,588
One is fully automatic,
one is semiautomatic.

611
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,383
The definition of semiautomatic is,
when you depress the trigger...

612
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,302
one round will go off.

613
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:57,058
That's what I want to give you.
Spend one round at a time. Okay?

614
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,935
Turn on the lights.

615
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,021
Check the breaker box.
It's happened before.

616
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,652
Man who did this is a professional.

617
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,033
- Who is he and why is he on my ship?
- Your ship?

618
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,453
You wouldn't be on this battleship
if not for me.

619
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,872
He's a cook, plain and simple.

620
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,125
- This is not the work of a cook.
- He came with the captain.

621
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:27,338
I know his routine front and back.
He's good with cooking knives.

622
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,423
Shit! Cooking knives!

623
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,469
He got lucky.

624
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,431
In my professional opinion,
he is a military reject...

625
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,850
in command of a galley.

626
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,478
Get down!

627
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,744
- What was that?
- A bomb, jackass.

628
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,455
He used the microwave as a detonator.

629
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,333
Secure everything
between here and the CIC.

630
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,712
You see anything, radio at once
for backup. Understand?

631
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,839
Put these fires out!

632
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,721
I'd like to see the personnel file
on this plain-and-simple cook.

633
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,890
- Yes, sir.
- Put out these goddamn fires!

634
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,689
SEAL Team 5 will launch from Nimitz
aboard a CH-53 Echo...

635
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,108
with an Apache gunship in support.

636
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,029
At the objective area, the Apache
will take out the ship's radar...

637
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,531
and her electronic warfare systems.

638
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,492
Then SEAL Team 5 will board
and retake the vessel.

639
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,162
And the odds of success?

640
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,248
If it's a lunatic who only
partially controls the ship...

641
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,833
the odds are good.

642
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,420
But if he's ready for us...

643
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,006
if he's prepared to repel boarders...

644
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,216
the odds are not good.

645
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:59,180
Bear in mind, the operators
from SEAL Team 5 are the best there are.

646
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,517
This is our only hope of saving
the crew and retaking the ship intact.

647
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,188
Let me make one thing
absolutely clear.

648
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,191
If the SEAL team fails...

649
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:14,487
we will have no alternative
but to launch an air strike...

650
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,615
and destroy the Missouri.

651
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,368
You know what that means.

652
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,121
We'll get her back for you.

653
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,957
Make it happen. Make it happen.

654
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,878
Twenty-two, 12, perfect.

655
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,381
It's 44 feet from the weather deck
to the missile canisters.

656
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:38,260
It'll take a half hour to assemble
that section of the crane.

657
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:44,350
Ryback's file wasn't in personnel.
It was in the captain's private cabinet.

658
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,560
Ryback is an ex-SEAL.

659
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,521
The goddamn cook's a SEAL?

660
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,774
Shut up and listen.
Expert in martial arts...

661
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,235
explosives, weapons, tactics.

662
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,822
Silver Star. Navy Cross.
Purple Heart with cluster.

663
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:03,244
Security revoked after Panama.
So he could only rate as a yeoman...

664
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,747
or a cook. How little did I know.

665
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,458
We lost two men in the engine room.

666
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,586
You were told to review
every crew member's file.

667
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,132
I know, but I didn't have access
to the captain's files!

668
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,468
- I'll get this fucker myself.
- Oh, no, calm down.

669
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,804
- Want to get killed?
- Are you an idiot?

670
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,098
- You're calling me an idiot?
- Yeah, I am.

671
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,018
Calm down. Get me three roving patrols.
Keep him below the weather deck.

672
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,854
- Move out!
- Stay on schedule!

673
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,357
To the bridge!

674
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,737
I'm the girl.
Why do I have to carry everything?

675
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,992
- I support women's lib, don't you?
- When it works in my favor.

676
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,578
- Hear this, all personnel.
- Move ahead.

677
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,872
Beware of booby traps.

678
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,584
Do not pursue hostile parties into
areas of the ship we do not control.

679
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,797
Report to Daumer individually
at five-minute intervals and switch...

680
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,091
to the alternate frequency.

681
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,467
Now.

682
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,015
Goddamn SEAL.

683
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,893
I'll carry everything...

684
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,979
if you kill whoever we run into.

685
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,982
I have a rule about killing people.

686
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,986
Actually, I have two rules. One.

687
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,198
I don't date musicians.
And two. I don't kill people.

688
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,075
I'm thrilled to death to hear that.

689
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,245
But it leaves a lot of open territory.
Get up the ladder.

690
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,788
- Let's go.
- God!

691
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,585
I think you've got the wrong partner.

692
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,798
Now wait here.

693
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,846
Sit down there.

694
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,058
I'll be back in a minute.

695
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,188
What's that?

696
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,151
What is that?

697
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,778
This is a SEAL magnaphone.

698
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,074
It's an MX 20-20.
It's a secure satellite uplink.

699
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,493
Like a car phone.

700
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,122
Yeah. Something like that.

701
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,214
Excuse me, this is hot.

702
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,054
You know Casey Ryback?

703
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,972
Chief Ryback?

704
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,142
He's top hand in the Teams.
Wish we had him here.

705
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,479
He reached us on a SEAL magnaphone.
He's on the Missouri.

706
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,022
What?

707
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,525
Listen. Everyone listen up.

708
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,528
Affirmative. Roger that.

709
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,281
Can you estimate
the size of the force?

710
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,658
- I'd say about 30.
- Affirmative.

711
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,744
We'll connect you to Captain Garza.

712
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,412
Stand by.

713
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,206
What if he's working for them?

714
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,793
Hey, I'll guarantee Ryback.
He's a good guy.

715
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,378
Wait a minute.

716
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,589
We won't take the chance.
Don't tell him about our response.

717
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,927
- Chief Ryback, Captain Garza.
- Glad you're there.

718
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,722
What we want you to do
is just feed us on-site intel.

719
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,850
This man may be crazy,
but he's a professional.

720
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:41,146
They're manufacturing a railing
system to offload the Tomahawks.

721
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,941
Believe it or not,
the XO's with them.

722
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,986
Commander Krill's involved?

723
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,321
Admiral...

724
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,241
That means they control the ship.

725
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,909
Holy God.

726
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,996
Chief Ryback,
this is Admiral Bates speaking.

727
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,248
Sir.

728
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,877
Coordinate your efforts with us.
I want you to keep cool...

729
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,047
and wait for the strike team.
Do you understand?

730
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,675
I'd better get
off before they pick up the signal.

731
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,428
- Call us in half an hour.
- Roger that.

732
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,263
You're not a cook.

733
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,516
Yeah, well...

734
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,728
I also cook.

735
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,439
Get your stuff.

736
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,984
He had an extremely distinguished
career until Panama...

737
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:30,195
when most of his team was killed
due to poor intelligence.

738
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,615
Ryback's a warrior. The best there is.

739
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,286
When he got back from Panama,
he punched his officer in charge.

740
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:41,039
Adams took him on as a cook
so he could finish his 20.

741
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,125
Hold it. Just hold it.

742
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:47,254
What if this toad, Zwieback,
or whatever his name is, is right...

743
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:51,508
and the missiles are offloaded
before the SEAL team gets there?

744
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,678
There is no way for Mr. Strannix
to get past us.

745
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,765
We have AWAC surveillance
and SOSUS in Honolulu...

746
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,852
tracking every ship and sub at sea.

747
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,938
They leave the Missouri, they're ours.

748
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,109
How do we know that Honolulu
isn't his next target?

749
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,195
Tell me that.

750
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,502
Take a look at this.

751
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,131
- Know what all those lights are for?
- I've been trained.

752
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,759
Come on! All right. All right.

753
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,347
- You can fly that helicopter?
- Yeah.

754
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,475
- Then we can get out of here, right?
- No.

755
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,852
Here's the MP5K.

756
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,231
When the dot's on target,
what you see is what you get.

757
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,109
- I told you I don't like guns.
- I know. Neither do I.

758
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,987
Now get back under there.

759
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:26,853
These things are going to sell
like hot cakes!

760
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,689
Absolutely.

761
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,359
What are you gonna do
with $200 million in the bank?

762
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,860
Buy the presidency.

763
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,266
Someone's moving. Right there!

764
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:11,231
He's on the flight deck! Go! Go!

765
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,152
Come on out of there!

766
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:16,505
Where are you taking me?
I don't know anything! I don't know!

767
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,468
Let go of me! Leave me alone!

768
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,345
Get your hands off of me!

769
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,764
Now! God, leave me alone!

770
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,358
Move!

771
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,777
There he is!

772
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:48,620
Move!

773
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,958
Stand fast!
Do not pursue that man!

774
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,802
- Secure missile battery three, now!
- Man that hatch!

775
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,595
This guy's a pain in the ass!

776
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,764
We got to do something about him.

777
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,558
I know what to do.

778
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,644
I do.

779
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,150
This insanity is so logical.

780
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,779
There's a sprinkler system
where they're being held.

781
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,614
Mr. Pitt?

782
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:27,701
The focsle.

783
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,329
Hit a button, it starts to flood.

784
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,374
In a short time, they'll all drown.

785
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,793
Ryback'll kill himself trying to save them.

786
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,712
Mr. Pitt.

787
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,430
You're a maniac.

788
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,432
Drowning your own crew.

789
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,310
They never liked me anyway.

790
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,605
Bet they fucking love you now.

791
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,072
You see this? These are cut everywhere.

792
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,616
What is that?

793
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:12,037
They're for a railing system to offload
the missiles onto a ship or sub...

794
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,164
they're gonna rendezvous with.

795
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:17,709
What's that?

796
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,837
Morse code.

797
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,007
What are they saying?

798
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,678
Get me the fuck out of here.

799
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,355
- What's that?
- Get away from the hatch!

800
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,918
Now what?

801
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,798
Ryback?

802
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:11,513
Johnson, guard the door.
Shoot anyone who comes through.

803
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,265
You okay?

804
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,475
Yeah. Are you okay?

805
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,352
Yeah.

806
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,437
- Is this all of you?
- What you see.

807
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,898
Six of us got trapped.
What's going on?

808
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,568
We got a problem. Who's this?

809
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,113
Calaway, Gunner's mate,
2nd class, '44, '46.

810
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,908
This is Jordan. She's a casualty
of the situation I'll brief you on.

811
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,453
- Hi.
- Nice to see you. You too, Case.

812
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,081
Granger, you take this.

813
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,377
- Get your tools. We've got work to do.
- Right.

814
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,005
We're jumping into a shit storm here.

815
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,099
Must've been a power surge.

816
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,851
Yeah.

817
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,190
That's the last one.

818
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,694
This should disable their
weapons systems within a half an hour.

819
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,406
Mr. Ryback,
may I have your attention, please?

820
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,159
This is Captain Krill speaking.

821
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,333
I'd like you to look at the monitors...

822
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,835
where you are
at this point in time.

823
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,213
Are you watching?

824
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,716
I prepared a special show for you.

825
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:33,970
Here it goes.

826
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:41,144
I want you to know
there are no hard feelings.

827
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,273
I have no grudge against you...

828
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,609
or the rest of the crew.

829
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,152
You did your best.

830
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,787
Discipline is right out
the window here.

831
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,833
Granger, turn it off.

832
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:05,961
We got to save them.

833
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,545
They'll have a trap.

834
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:11,341
But they're expecting me,
not all of us.

835
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,259
All of what? I do laundry.

836
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:16,721
I ironed during the Gulf War.
I ain't cut out for this.

837
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,807
You're in the Navy, remember?

838
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,142
It's not a job, it's an adventure.

839
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,979
To hell with that.
I'm on the college program.

840
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,855
- I'm with you, Case.
- Let's do it.

841
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,524
We're out of here.

842
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,110
All right,
I'll stay and watch Miss July.

843
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,488
- Get the lights out in broadway.
- I'm going.

844
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,324
Okay, but the emergency lights
will kick on soon.

845
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,869
All right, what the hell.
How does this work?

846
01:06:58,848 --> 01:06:59,889
Go!

847
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,941
Take cover! Take cover! Come on, guys!

848
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:20,368
Take cover! Get down!

849
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,540
Turn it!

850
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,335
Turn the water off!

851
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,548
They're gonna get us out of here!

852
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,008
They're gonna get us out!

853
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,056
Pull him out of there!
Pull him out of there!

854
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,974
Help him, Tack! Help him!

855
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,439
Come on, buddy!

856
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,399
Breathe!

857
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,568
Listen to him!

858
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,320
Hang in there!

859
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,447
Shit!

860
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:59,199
We'll be offloading in an hour.

861
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:02,494
Listen, he freed a few men,
and I think...

862
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,915
they went into the focsle,
but we got them pinned down.

863
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,292
Kill them if you can't contain them.

864
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,002
It worked. They're trapped.

865
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,796
- Good.
- Drop the anchor!

866
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,311
This is where it's going to happen.

867
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,444
Hello?

868
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,322
- Who in the hell is this?
- Who in the hell is this?

869
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,743
This is Admiral Bates.
I'm trying to get ahold of Ryback.

870
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,746
He's in a gunfight.
I'll have to take a message.

871
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,706
What's going on there?

872
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,043
Hold on. Here.

873
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:55,672
Yes, sir.

874
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,967
Chief Ryback, this is Admiral Bates.

875
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,720
I see that you completely
disobeyed my orders. Correct?

876
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,807
Sorry. You can court-martial me
if I live.

877
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,433
I see.

878
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,686
Listen to me carefully.

879
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,522
SEAL Team 5 is en route.
You understand?

880
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,940
Yes, sir.

881
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,819
Nimitz air group is our backup.
Understand?

882
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,864
Yes, sir.

883
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:24,367
Now, since your ass is on the line,
I authorize you...

884
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:28,538
to do whatever you can
to aid the arrival of the SEALs.

885
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,457
Because if I goddamn
can't control you...

886
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,962
- I might as well support you. Correct?
- That's affirmative, sir.

887
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,797
You...

888
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,342
You have some good luck there, sailor.
I'm out.

889
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:44,762
They got a lot of trouble on that ship.

890
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,561
Here I go.

891
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,870
I'm not staying here.

892
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:11,331
- Where are you going?
- What did you say to her?

893
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:25,428
- What are you doing?
- The safest place is behind you.

894
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,681
Hug the wall.
Get out of the middle!

895
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,392
Miss July, come back here!

896
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,556
Casey!

897
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,534
TAG leader, this is Cobra escort.
We have you in our sights.

898
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,287
You should see us
on your portside now.

899
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:25,131
Francois, put the money in the Zurich
bank now, or nothing will happen.

900
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,175
Fuck you, Strannix!

901
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,553
Sell what we got
in MacGregor Aircraft.

902
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,348
It'll go to shit
when they find out about this.

903
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,893
Two choppers trying to sneak in
under our radar.

904
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,144
Strike team.

905
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,814
We drive a hard bargain for hard value.

906
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:50,490
You give me any more trouble,
I'll call Mohammed. Understand?

907
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,742
Strike team is in range and locked on.

908
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,077
Kill them.

909
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:57,497
Not you, Francois.
I'll put my accountant on the line...

910
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,124
with my account number.
Talk to that frog.

911
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,754
Strannix?

912
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,547
Something's wrong.

913
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:10,718
We've got a big problem here.
Switch to auxiliary!

914
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:12,053
Nothing.

915
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,102
Shit, I lost the phalanx.
We're sitting ducks.

916
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,312
Get me secure to the sub.

917
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:28,653
Sub's up.

918
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,364
Coyote, this is Roadrunner. Come in.

919
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,931
Here come the good guys.

920
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:04,689
One minute!

921
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:05,982
One minute!

922
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:10,736
The fantail's fouled up!
We're going in on the bow.

923
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:20,037
What the hell was that?!

924
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,353
It's confirmed. We lost them all.

925
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,149
We have no choice now...

926
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,071
but full air assault from the Nimitz.

927
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:59,285
Mr. Trenton, would you please?

928
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,665
We need more hands on deck
to help tie this sub up.

929
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,209
Start offloading.

930
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,796
The crane isn't finished.
We got another problem below decks.

931
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:14,300
Pull four men off the welding crew
to help tie up the sub.

932
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,593
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

933
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,360
My goodness!

934
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:39,867
Daumer, Daumer, Daumer.
Why didn't you hire this person?

935
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:44,038
Whatever his price would've been,
it would've been worth it.

936
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,127
Bring it up!

937
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:34,589
Okay, okay. Ease it over.
Ease it over now.

938
01:16:57,237 --> 01:17:00,239
Number seven. Number seven.
Get number seven now.

939
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,824
Easy!

940
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,520
There's someone in the water!

941
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,356
Behind you!

942
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,608
- I saw someone in the water!
- Hey! Hey!

943
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:28,661
Hook him!

944
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,581
Hook that son of a bitch!

945
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,765
Check for a bomb!

946
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,117
Who saw him? Come on!

947
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,057
You're incredible, Ryback.

948
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:36,687
It's a shame you're not cooking for us.

949
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:52,995
Next thing I know...

950
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,415
you'll be dating musicians.

951
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,340
What the hell you doing over there?

952
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,389
Where's Daumer?

953
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,308
Probably dead.

954
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,936
The bowplane is jammed.

955
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,395
We can't submerge.

956
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:24,360
I'll handle it.
It'll be operational under way.

957
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,946
You fix it, I'll make you an admiral.

958
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,240
Consider it done. Where are you going?

959
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:33,410
- Make Honolulu glow in the dark.
- Outstanding.

960
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,664
I'll meet you 15 miles
due south in the captain's launch.

961
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,875
Rally your men here in zero one.

962
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:45,047
I need an acetylene torch,
an arc welder and a crowbar, now!

963
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,009
- What'd he say?
- He can't fix it.

964
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:51,762
I'll fix it! Go! Now!

965
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,807
Why can't you speak English?

966
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,981
Hang in there, Casey.

967
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,211
Talk to me.

968
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,131
There's nothing to say.

969
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,009
Whatever they did...

970
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,636
they're smarter than I am.

971
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,972
Everything's dead.

972
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:36,682
It's hopeless.

973
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:39,560
Nothing is hopeless. Take heart.

974
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,066
Give me time, I'll figure it out.

975
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:49,320
I like your attitude. Excellent.

976
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:56,368
It's clear. Hey, Case.

977
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,041
What the hell?

978
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,923
I'll put it to you in plain English.
It is so simple.

979
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,508
Hammer that rod into place.

980
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,678
Weld it over the bowplane.
Without it, we can't survive.

981
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,014
Make him understand. Now!

982
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:29,318
Where's Johnson?

983
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,197
- He's gone.
- We can't let them get away with this!

984
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,240
What about those 5-inch guns?

985
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:40,037
No good. We offloaded all the
armor-piercing rounds. We got starbursts.

986
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,997
Nothing that will penetrate.

987
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,586
Calaway.

988
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,547
- Gunner's mate.
- Yeah, chief.

989
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:51,757
See those?

990
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:55,886
We still got shells for those.

991
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,776
I did it.

992
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:14,697
It's charging. In a few minutes
we'll have enough power to fire.

993
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,073
Well done.

994
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:24,999
Let's go!

995
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:31,255
Get on those last three bags!

996
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:34,967
Out of line.

997
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,387
- Another one.
- Watch my hand signals!

998
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,472
Stand clear!

999
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,646
Easy, guys, easy. Just glide it through.

1000
01:23:57,907 --> 01:24:00,034
What's the sub's course and speed?

1001
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,828
Course 172. Speed six knots.

1002
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:06,165
Get down the 5-inch guns!

1003
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,752
- What do you want me to do?
- See those black switches?

1004
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:14,006
- Click them on, one by one.
- If the sub blows, won't the nukes go?

1005
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,133
No. They won't detonate.

1006
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:17,634
They'll sink with the sub.

1007
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:18,927
Lower the cradle.

1008
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:21,013
Cradle lowered.

1009
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:23,640
- Ram the projectile.
- Easy.

1010
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,894
Ram the powder easy.

1011
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:28,187
Real easy.

1012
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:30,606
Starbursts are ready.

1013
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,149
Fire the starburst!

1014
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:35,402
All right.

1015
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:38,947
You, secure this room.
Get back to work, jack-off!

1016
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,619
They're firing at us!

1017
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:45,537
They're just desperate.

1018
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:50,250
Those are starbursts.
They don't have shells to hurt us.

1019
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,336
Two-zero-four degrees, Calaway.

1020
01:24:57,675 --> 01:24:58,926
Elevate the barrel.

1021
01:24:59,302 --> 01:25:01,261
Zero-two-eight degrees.

1022
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:11,647
Fire in the hole.

1023
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:25,077
He's doing it! We're out of time!

1024
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,454
They're reloading right now.

1025
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,997
Granger, Tackman! Reload!

1026
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,336
Lowering cradle.

1027
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:35,879
Scoot over!

1028
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:40,592
Goddamn it!

1029
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:41,844
Close the breech.

1030
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:45,973
Lower it. Lower the bowplane!

1031
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,603
Pull! It's working! It's working!
Come on, let's go.

1032
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,438
Two-four-one degrees.

1033
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:55,023
Two-four-one degrees back.

1034
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,025
Dive!

1035
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:03,073
It's working!

1036
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:06,368
- Two-zero-four degrees.
- Two-zero-four degrees.

1037
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:07,995
This is it.

1038
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:13,250
Ryback is gone.

1039
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,086
Let me look.

1040
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,674
Fire in the hole!

1041
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:39,234
- Direct hit!
- We hit it!

1042
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:47,242
Strannix, what the hell is going on?

1043
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:58,587
Daffy Duck. Porky Pig. Little red fucker
with the mustache. The big chicken.

1044
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:01,757
Strannix!

1045
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,844
All of my life...

1046
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,597
Saturday morning cartoons.

1047
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,182
The best.

1048
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:12,851
Shit.

1049
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,314
For example...

1050
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:21,902
remember those two little shrimp
coming in, riding seahorses...

1051
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,154
little chaps, little pistols?

1052
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,531
Shooting back over their shoulders.

1053
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:29,201
Rescue that lobster from the...

1054
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,703
Swedish cook.

1055
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,081
Funniest thing I ever saw!

1056
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,208
- Splendid work, by the way.
- Strannix!

1057
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:38,126
Splendid work!

1058
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,753
My, my, my...

1059
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,839
How hell doth quicken the spirit.

1060
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,343
- Tomahawks!
- They're up and ready.

1061
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:47,594
Where?

1062
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,555
- Fire control.
- Of course! The fire control.

1063
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:53,475
Chips and dips on the weather deck.

1064
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,895
Don't be late! Motor launch is waiting!
All hands!

1065
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,818
Clear out of here!

1066
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,612
Let's go.

1067
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,698
Strannix!

1068
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:08,907
Four minutes.

1069
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,327
- Four minutes.
- Meet us at the motor launch.

1070
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,204
Four little minutes.

1071
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,833
Home run.

1072
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:20,127
Yeah!

1073
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,421
We did it!

1074
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:24,756
This little piggy went to market.

1075
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,343
This little piggy stayed home.

1076
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,637
And this little piggy...

1077
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,432
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

1078
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,104
All the way home!

1079
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:04,629
Happy trails.

1080
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,801
In the captain's launch, there's the
MX 20-20, the SEAL magnaphone.

1081
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,387
- Bring it here. Take her with you.
- The what?

1082
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:14,139
The car phone.

1083
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:25,859
- Admiral?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:29,529
The Nimitz is tracking two Tomahawks
launched from the ship.

1085
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,365
- Where are they headed?
- Honolulu.

1086
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:32,991
Oh, God.

1087
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:36,370
- What's the flight time?
- Twenty-four minutes, sir.

1088
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:41,500
- Can we destroy them in the air?
- Destruct codes are on the Missouri.

1089
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:44,378
Scramble Navy and Air Force
fighters from Pearl.

1090
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:48,924
What are the consequences
of missiles dropping on Honolulu?

1091
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:53,804
About 1 million people will reach
10,000 degrees Fahrenheit...

1092
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:55,764
in less than a second.

1093
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,853
Mr. Secretary...

1094
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,482
We'll just blame it on the cook.

1095
01:30:06,275 --> 01:30:07,651
Absolutely.

1096
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,282
Take it north.

1097
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,993
Roger that. Heading north.

1098
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,042
I'll take that weapon.

1099
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,211
Quietly.

1100
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,129
Now.

1101
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,641
You look familiar.

1102
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:04,643
I know you, don't I?

1103
01:32:04,894 --> 01:32:06,561
I think you do.

1104
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,482
Been a long time.

1105
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:12,400
Yes, sir. It has.

1106
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:13,735
Turn around.

1107
01:32:14,987 --> 01:32:16,988
We'll have a tour. Step forward.

1108
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:22,285
Here we have...

1109
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,037
our Tomahawks...

1110
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:27,916
speeding their way to the sunny
Aloha State. Turn around.

1111
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,043
As you can see...

1112
01:32:31,295 --> 01:32:32,796
there will be no return.

1113
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:34,756
And I got the key.

1114
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,467
The lock is broken. Step forward.

1115
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,261
Sit over there.

1116
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:43,098
You'll watch the end of the world on TV.

1117
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,185
Put your feet up. Relax.

1118
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:51,856
You know, you're good.

1119
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,442
You are really good.

1120
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:56,778
It's gonna be a shame to kill you.

1121
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,198
Behold my finest work.

1122
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,492
Do me a favor. Tell me something.

1123
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:06,746
You really think blowing up
a bunch of innocent people...

1124
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:08,790
is gonna change anything?

1125
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:10,625
What made you flip like this?

1126
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:14,045
I got tired of coming up with
desperate solutions...

1127
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:17,507
to impossible problems
created by other fucking people.

1128
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:21,720
All your ridiculous,
pitiful antics won't change a thing.

1129
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,430
You and I...

1130
01:33:24,056 --> 01:33:27,017
we're puppets in the same sick play.

1131
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,144
We serve the same master...

1132
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:34,941
and he's an ungrateful lunatic.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1133
01:33:35,318 --> 01:33:36,735
You and I are the same.

1134
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,821
No. There's a difference, my man.

1135
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,283
You have faith. I don't.

1136
01:34:38,547 --> 01:34:40,799
Keep the faith, Strannix.

1137
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,227
Locked on my nose, 15 miles.

1138
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:59,317
Five miles, on target.
Weapon status, clear.

1139
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,111
Roger.

1140
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,285
- Excuse me, admiral.
- Yes?

1141
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,414
They intercepted one missile.

1142
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,207
And the other one?

1143
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:15,917
It slipped through.

1144
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:34,894
Chief...

1145
01:35:35,187 --> 01:35:39,357
We've only got time for one shot.
So we'll do it by the numbers.

1146
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:42,068
Ryback, load the disk.

1147
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,987
Now punch 47.

1148
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:45,947
You're now on KU.

1149
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,578
Code is six, four...

1150
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:53,747
three, five...

1151
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,915
zero, zero.

1152
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,586
That's 643500.
Is my read-back correct?

1153
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:00,920
That's affirmative.

1154
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:12,974
Stand by, sir.

1155
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,749
Got it!
Nimitz is no longer tracking.

1156
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:41,002
Good man! Good man, Ryback!

1157
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,927
Sir, call off your bombers.
Call off your bombers.

1158
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:52,764
We're calling off the aircraft.
We're calling them off.

1159
01:36:53,015 --> 01:36:55,809
Thanks, Ryback. Great job!
Great job!

1160
01:36:56,101 --> 01:37:00,605
Want to go swimming?
I got a Zodiac and some C-rays...

1161
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,982
a little umbrella...

1162
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,526
I'll go with you.

1163
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:10,365
She's all right! She's all right!

1164
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,410
Good, good, all of you guys.

1165
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:15,703
Great!

1166
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,622
Good job!

1167
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:25,088
Hold on in there,
we'll get you out in a minute!

1168
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:44,399
What did I miss, chief?

1169
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:57,328
You'll need three or four stitches.
I wanna see you down in the infirmary.

1170
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,622
I'm afraid of needles, you know.

1171
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:05,753
- What's for breakfast, Case?
- Subs, Tackman. Subs!

1172
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,590
Case, show me a move.

1173
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:10,383
Here's one move.

1174
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:43,833
Present arms!
