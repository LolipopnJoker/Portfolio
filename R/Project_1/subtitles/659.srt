1
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:30,344
- Are you sure you're eighteen?
- Why? Do I look older?

2
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:40,776
- Alberta Scrubb?
- It's a typographical error

3
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:48,496
- It is supposed to be Albert A. Scrubb.
- Edmund, you are supposed to be helping
me with the groceries.

4
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:56,424
Better luck next time, ay, squirt?

5
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:04,352
Squirt? 
He barely had 2 years on me!

6
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:08,629
I am a king. I've fought wars
and I've led armies.

7
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,324
- Not in this world!
- Yeah, instead I'm stuck here,

8
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:16,140
doing battles with 
useless Clarence Scrubb.

9
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:19,374
If anyone so 
deserve the name.

10
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,130
What are you doing?

11
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:27,407
Nothing.
Come on then.

12
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:37,108
Dear Diary,
It is now day 253,

13
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,864
since my ratchet cousins
Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.

14
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:43,889
Not sure how much long 
I can cope living with them.

15
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:45,975
Hard to share my things.

16
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:49,522
If only one could treat relatives like
one who treat insects,

17
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:54,112
all my problems would be solved.
I could simply put them in a jar,

18
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,659
- pin them to my wall
- I'm home!

19
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:01,206
- Hello?
- Note to self,

20
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:05,483
investigate legal ramifications
of impaling relatives!

21
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,951
And that concludes the war news 
from the western front./Hi, Uncle Harold!

22
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:15,184
I've tried to find some carrots,
but all they had were turnips again.

23
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:19,149
Should I start making soup?
And Alberta is on her way home.

24
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:25,199
- Uncle Harold?
- Father.

25
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:29,580
Edward making faces at you!

26
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,188
- Why, you little...
- Father, he's going to hit me

27
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:36,257
Edmund look, it's from Susan!

28
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,552
I do wish you were here with us.
It is such an adventure.

29
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:43,455
But not like our times in Narnia.
America is very exciting.

30
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:48,149
Except we never see father.
He works so very hard.

31
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:51,800
I was invited to the British consul's
tea party this week by a naval officer,

32
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,973
who happens to be very handsome.
I think he fancies me.

33
00:03:55,973 --> 00:04:00,250
It seems that the Germans have made 
the crossing difficult right now.

34
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,214
Time are hard. Mother hopes 
you both won't mind,

35
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,883
another few months 
in Cambridge.

36
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:09,534
Another few months?
How will we survive?

37
00:04:09,534 --> 00:04:14,124
You're lucky. At least you've got your 
own room. I'm stuck with mullet mouth.

38
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,567
Susan and Peter 
are the lucky ones.

39
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:22,053
- Off on adventures.
- Yeah. They are the olders, we are the youngest.

40
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,243
We don't matter as much.

41
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,207
Do you think I 
look anything like Susan?

42
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:36,448
- Lucy, have you seen this ship before?
- Yes, it's very Narnian looking, isn't it?

43
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:41,247
Yeah. Just another reminder 
that we're here, not there!

44
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,003
There once was two orphans
 who wasted their time,

45
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:47,298
believing in 
Narnian nursery rhyme.

46
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:47,923
- Please let me hit him!
- No.

47
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:49,801
- Don't you ever knock?
- It's my house.

48
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,722
I do as I please. 
You're just guests.

49
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,938
What's so fascinating about 
that picture anyway? It's hideous.

50
00:04:57,938 --> 00:05:00,650
You won't see it from 
the outside of the door.

51
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,676
Edmund look, looks like 
the water is actually moving.

52
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:09,830
What rubbish, see? That's what happens when you
read all those fancy little novels and fairy tales of yours.

53
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,273
There once was a boy called Eustace, 
who read books for facts which were worthless

54
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:19,115
People who read fairy tales are always a sort of becoming
a hideous burden compared to people like me.

55
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:23,079
- I read books with real information.
- A hideous burden?

56
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:26,313
I haven't seen you lift a finger
since we've been here.

57
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:31,529
I hope you won't mind I tell your father it was you
who stole Aunt Alberta sweets?

58
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:32,989
- Liar!
- Really?

59
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:34,867
- Edmund, the painting!
- I found them under your bed.

60
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:38,205
And you know what? 
I've licked every one of them!

61
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,187
Ew! I'm infected with you!

62
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,741
- What is going on here?
- Lucy, do you think...

63
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:51,349
This is some kind of a trick. 
Stop or I'll tell mother.

64
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:54,270
Mother!

65
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,921
I'll just smash the whole thing.

66
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:03,241
- Do something!
- No.

67
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:06,058
- Help me.
- Let me go.

68
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,292
Let go.

69
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,264
- Eustace, swim!
- What's going on?

70
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:51,749
Swimming!

71
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,566
Swim.

72
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:04,894
It's alright! I got you.

73
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:08,127
- Caspian?
- Lucy.

74
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,300
- Edmund, it is Caspian.
- You're safe now.

75
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,221
- Are we in Narnia?
- Yes, you are in Narnia.

76
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:20,750
I don't wanna go. I want to go back 
to England! I'm going back to England!

77
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,984
Hold on!

78
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:44,743
That was thrilling!

79
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:48,290
- How in the world do you end up here?
- I have no idea.

80
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,524
- Caspian!
- Edmund!

81
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:54,653
- It's great to see you.
- Didn't you call for us?

82
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:58,722
No, not this time!

83
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,017
Well, whatever the case, 
I'm just glad to be here.

84
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:07,693
Ahh! Get that thing off me!

85
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:12,805
Reepicheep!

86
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,039
- Your Majesty.
- Hello, Reep.

87
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,064
- What a pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine sir.

88
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:23,341
But first, what to do about
this hysterical interloper?

89
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,471
That giant rat thing 
just tried to claw my face off!

90
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:30,956
I was merely trying to expel 
the water from your lungs, sir.

91
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,607
- Does anyone understand? He just talk!
- He always talks.

92
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,528
Actually its getting him to 
shut up, that's the trick.

93
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:41,075
The moment there is nothing to be said 
your highness, I promise you I will not say it.

94
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:45,352
I don't know what kind of prank this is.
I wanna wake up right now!

95
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,439
Perhaps we can throw him back?

96
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,654
And being abducted by a kind
of zeepiratencarnival.

97
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:56,931
I demand to know just 
where in the blazes am I?

98
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,896
You're on the Dawn Treader.
The finest ship in Narnia's Navy

99
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:08,511
Was it something I said?

100
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:11,536
- See to him for me.
- Your majesty.

101
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:17,482
Men!

102
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:21,133
Behold our castaways!

103
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:24,680
Edmund the Just
and Lucy the Valiant.

104
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:28,436
High King and Queen of Narnia.

105
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,670
Aslan.

106
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,015
Look! Susan's bow and arrows.

107
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:16,422
- Lucy!
- My Healing Cordial and Dagger!

108
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:18,926
- Oh, May I?
- Of course. They are yours.

109
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:21,534
- Peter's sword.
- Yes.

110
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:24,455
I looked after as promised.

111
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,940
Here.
Hold it if you wish.

112
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,278
No, it's yours.
Peter has given it to you.

113
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,556
I did saved this for you though.

114
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,754
Thanks.

115
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:47,405
Since you've left, the Giants in the North
had surrendered unconditionally.

116
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,804
And we defeated the Calormen army 
of the great desert.

117
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:53,872
- There is peace across all of Narnia.
- Peace?

118
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,541
For three years.

119
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,401
And have you found yourself 
a queen in those three years?

120
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,696
No. Not one to
compare to your sister.

121
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:06,182
Hang on, so there are no wars to fight
and no one is in trouble...

122
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,999
- then, why are we here?
- That's a good question.

123
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,355
I have been asking myself
the same thing.

124
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:14,945
- So, where are we sailing?
- To get back the throne from my uncle.

125
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:18,804
He tried to kill my father's closest friends 
and most loyal supporters.

126
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,247
The seven Lords of Telmar.

127
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,985
They fled to the Lone Islands.

128
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:31,531
No one has heard from them since.

129
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:36,643
- So you think something has happened to them?
- Well, if it has...

130
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:39,147
It is my duty to find out.

131
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:42,276
What lies east of the Lone Islands?

132
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:47,492
Uncharted waters. Things that
you can barely imagine.

133
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:50,935
Tales of sea serpents and worse.

134
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:57,924
- Sea serpents?
- Alright captain, enough of your tall tales.

135
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:13,154
Where skies I want to be, 
where the waves are sweet.

136
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:18,579
Descends upon you, 
Reepicheep!

137
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:26,924
- That's pretty!
- Oh! Thank you.

138
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:31,097
A "driad" sung to me 
when I was just a "materling".

139
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:35,583
I can't divine the meaning but 
I've never forgotten the words.

140
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:36,835
What do you think 
past Lone Islands is?

141
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,903
I've been told the furthest east 
one can sail is to the end of the world.

142
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:44,971
- Aslan's country.
- Do you really believe there is such a place?

143
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:49,144
We have nothing if we do not believe.

144
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,734
Do you think you can 
actually sail there?

145
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,821
Well, there is only 
one way of finding that out.

146
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,785
Only hope one day 
I'd earn the right to see it.

147
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:03,644
Your majesty.

148
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,628
You have grown stronger, my friend.

149
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:05,088
Seems I have.

150
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:09,574
Alright! Back to work.

151
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:23,344
Edmund, Do you think if we keep sailing
to the end of the world, we just...

152
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:24,387
tip off the edge?

153
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:27,516
Don't worry, Lu.
We're long way from there.

154
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,186
I see you're still talking nonsense.

155
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:35,653
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, but not thanks to you.

156
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:40,139
- It's like I have an iron constitution.
- You're ever "vesitence" ever I see.

157
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,225
- Found your sea legs?
- Never lost them.

158
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,686
It's just given a shock of things.

159
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:47,650
Obviously have the cutest position,
due to my intelligence.

160
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,258
I don't think he has "apute" anything

161
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:52,553
I'll have you know as soon as
I find civilization.

162
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:55,891
I'm contacting the British Consulate.
Having you arrested for kidnapping.

163
00:14:55,891 --> 00:15:00,272
Kidnapping is it? That's funny.
I thought we had saved your life.

164
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:02,359
- You held me here against my own will!
- Did I?

165
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:07,679
...in that quarters
It's like a zoo down there!

166
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,913
- He's quite the complainer, isn't he?
- He is just warming up.

167
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:13,208
Landfall!

168
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:39,496
The Lone Islands.
Narrow Haven's portal.

169
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,000
Strange. No Narnia flag in sight.

170
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:45,860
The Lone Islands has
always been of Narnia's.

171
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,763
Seems suspicious.

172
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,518
I say we prepare a party

173
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:58,899
- Drinian?
- Forgive me, Your Majesty...

174
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,489
But the chain of command starts 
with Prince Caspian on this ship

175
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,558
Right!/We use rowboats. Drinian, 
pick some men and come on shore!

176
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:15,486
Men the row boats! Throw 
the sailer and prepare to go out,

177
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:19,554
and get ready to lower the anchor.

178
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,263
En route! Lies ahead!

179
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:36,663
Can't we just wait till the morning?

180
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:40,835
There is no honor in 
turning away from adventure land.

181
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:44,486
Listen!
Where is everyone?

182
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:48,972
- Come on, jelly legs.
- I'm capable of getting out myself!

183
00:16:51,684 --> 00:16:54,501
And you're certain 
you're related by blood?

184
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,207
Reepicheep, stay here with 
Drinian's men and secure the place.

185
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:22,250
We will head up.

186
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,710
If we don't come back by dawn,

187
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,631
- send the party.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

188
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:46,243
Yeah, looks like nobody is in.
So do you think we should go back?

189
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:51,355
Do you want to come here 
and guard...something?

190
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,693
Ah, yes.
Good idea, cousin.

191
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:57,822
Very..um, logical.

192
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:12,010
I've got it.
Don't worry.

193
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:31,621
I'm ready to go when you are!

194
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,478
- Who are all these people?
- Why are they've been crossed out?

195
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:53,320
- Looks like some kind of fee..?
- Slave Traders.

196
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,014
Look out!

197
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:18,252
Unless you want to hear 
this scum squeal like a girl again,

198
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:21,694
I would say, 
you should drop your weapons.

199
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,989
- I'm not a girl.
- Now!

200
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:27,849
- Put it down!
- Eustace!

201
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:33,795
- Put them in irons!
- Come here you!

202
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:34,630
Get your hands off me!
Let go!

203
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,011
Take these two to the market.
Send those other two to the dungeons.

204
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,349
Listen to me, you insolent fool.
I am your king!

205
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,731
- You're gonna pay for that!
- Actually...

206
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:50,486
someone else is going to pay...

207
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:53,511
for all of you.

208
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:13,436
- You all right?
- Yeah.

209
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:21,364
It is hopeless.
You'll never get out.

210
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,746
- Who's there?
- Nobody.

211
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:28,041
Just a voice in my head.

212
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,750
Lord Bern?

213
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:49,635
That was me once.
I do not deserve that title anymore.

214
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,930
Is he one of the seven?

215
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:04,761
Your face. You remind me of
a king that I once know.

216
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:08,412
That man was my father.

217
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:11,959
My Lord, please forgive me.

218
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,732
No, please.

219
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:19,783
No!

220
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:33,344
- Mommy!
- Get back!

221
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:39,395
- Stay with daddy!
- Don't worry. I will find you!

222
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:40,855
Mommy!

223
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,877
- Where are they taking them?
- Keep watching!

224
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,755
- What happened?
- It's a sacrifice.

225
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:33,119
- Where did they go?
- No one knows.

226
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:37,083
The mist was first seen 
in the east.

227
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:41,047
Reports of fishermen and sailors
disappearing out at sea.

228
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,342
We lords have made a pact...

229
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:46,367
to find the source of the mist
and to destroy them.

230
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:48,245
They each set sail,

231
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:51,061
but none of them came back.

232
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:58,781
You see, if they don't sell you 
to the slave traders,

233
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:03,475
- you're likely to be fed to the mist
- We have to find Lucy,

234
00:23:03,788 --> 00:23:07,126
- before it's too late.
- I offer 60.

235
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:08,795
- I bid 80!
- 100 for the little lady.

236
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:12,447
- 120!
- 150!

237
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,889
Anymore bids?

238
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,436
SOLD!

239
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:21,835
Come on, move!

240
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,094
And now, for this fine speciment!

241
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:30,076
Who'd kick off the bidding?

242
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:35,605
Come on now, he may not 
seem like much, but uh..he is strong.

243
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,569
Yes, he's strong alright. Smells like
the rear end of a Minotaur.

244
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,864
That is an outrageous lie.

245
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,994
I won the school hygeine award,
two years running!

246
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:50,210
- Come on, someone make your bid!
- I'll take them off your hands.

247
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:54,904
I'll take them all out of your hands.

248
00:23:54,904 --> 00:23:56,886
For Narnia!

249
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:20,462
- Thanks, Reep. I knew you would come.
- Your Highness!

250
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:30,268
Grab the keys!

251
00:24:36,632 --> 00:24:38,822
Keys!

252
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:19,089
Oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?

253
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:41,205
I hope that wasn't British consul.

254
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:44,021
- Your majesty!
- Wait.

255
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:48,090
- My wife was taken just this morning.
- Daddy!

256
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:50,385
I beg you, take me with you.

257
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:52,367
- I want to come.
- No, Gael. Stay with your aunt.

258
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:57,791
I am a fight sailor, been on the seas
my whole life.

259
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:00,608
- Of course, you must.
- Thank you.

260
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:04,572
- But Daddy!
- If I ever not come back...

261
00:26:05,093 --> 00:26:06,450
Now be good.

262
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,943
My king!

263
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:24,184
This was given to me by your father.
I hid it safely in the cave.

264
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:26,479
- All these years.
- I thought that is Narnian sword?

265
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:29,295
It's from your Golden Age.
There are seven of those swords.

266
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:34,198
Gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.

267
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:36,806
Your father entrusted them to us.

268
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:38,475
Here. Take it.

269
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:44,317
And it may protect you.

270
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:59,130
Thank you, my Lord!
And we shall find your "lost sisters"

271
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:02,260
Edmund!

272
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,019
Dear diary, there has been 
extraordinary turn of event.

273
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:27,088
I have been abducted by my cousins 
and set to drift in uncharted waters,

274
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:28,444
in some ridiculously looking boat.

275
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,329
What's worse, as I share quarters 
with obnoxious mouse thing,

276
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,207
My thought barking with 
my cousins was bad enough.

277
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:40,023
So far, every person I met in 
this strange place suffers...

278
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:42,318
from the most florit delusions

279
00:27:42,318 --> 00:27:46,700
Chasing for green mists 
and looking for lost lords.

280
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:51,394
I can only assume 
this is the result of poor diet.

281
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:52,333
Everyone are barking mad.

282
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:58,383
Cousin Edmund is no exception.

283
00:27:58,383 --> 00:28:01,096
He spends every spare second
rubbing that thin sword.

284
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:05,373
Like it's some magic lantern.
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.

285
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,876
It is going to be magnificient.
Do they come in a smaller size?

286
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:13,927
Peeving Marmud!
He's more delusional than my cousin.

287
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:19,456
In England, we have mousetraps
and that sort of things.

288
00:28:22,794 --> 00:28:25,402
Speaking of food, 
don't you think I can get any, do you?

289
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:28,844
Uh, why you talking to that bird?

290
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:35,729
- I just naturally assumed that...
- (Laughs) He's talking to birds.

291
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,129
He is as mad as a looner that one.

292
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,406
Shoo! Go go!

293
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:10,780
Are you aware sir...
Stealing rations is a capital offense?

294
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,849
Up here!

295
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:19,334
- You.
- Men have been killed for less.

296
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:23,090
- For What?
- Treason and sneakiness...and general nuisances.

297
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,115
Just hand over the orange 
and we'll let the matter pass.

298
00:29:26,637 --> 00:29:30,496
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Allow me to...

299
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,730
- I've had quite enough of you.
- Unhand the tail!

300
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,547
The Great Aslan himself 
gave me this tail.

301
00:29:36,547 --> 00:29:40,198
No one. Repeat, 
no one touches the tail.

302
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:44,058
- Period "exclamation mark"
- Sorry!

303
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:48,856
Now. I will have the orange, 
then I will have satisfaction.

304
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:50,630
Puh, puh, please, please, 
please, um. I'm a pacifist.

305
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:59,080
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

306
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:05,339
Are you trying to run away?
We're on a boat you know.

307
00:30:06,591 --> 00:30:07,634
Can't we just discuss this?

308
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:13,371
That is for stealing, that is for lying,
and that was for good measure.

309
00:30:15,353 --> 00:30:19,735
(Laughs) That's the spirit! 
We have ourselves a duel! Catch.

310
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:23,594
Now, come on.
Take your best shot.

311
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,515
Is that it?
Come on, boy.

312
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,836
Stop flapping your wings like
a drunken pelican.

313
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:37,156
Hoist!
Keep your leg up.

314
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:47,588
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

315
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:49,778
On your foot.
On your left, your right.

316
00:30:49,778 --> 00:30:54,473
Got it? Come on.
The Nimble. It is a dance, boy.

317
00:30:55,307 --> 00:31:00,002
Come on now. And again.

318
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:02,610
Oh, no!

319
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:12,311
And that!

320
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:20,761
Look!

321
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,725
Gael, what are you doing here?

322
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,632
It seems that we
have an extra crew member.

323
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:57,794
- Welcome aboard.
- Your majesty.

324
00:31:57,898 --> 00:31:59,985
Call me Lucy.
Come on.

325
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,654
Come on, look lovely, back to work!

326
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:10,208
Good match!
I will make a swordsman of you yet.

327
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:15,737
Yes, well...it's the plane 
we look more even

328
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:16,884
it would be
an entirely different result.

329
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:19,909
(Laughs) Indeed!

330
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,679
It looks like uninhabited.

331
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,018
If the Lords follow the mist to the east,
they would have stopped here.

332
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,834
It could be a trap.

333
00:32:40,147 --> 00:32:44,946
- Or it can help us some answer!
- Caspian?

334
00:32:46,824 --> 00:32:50,057
We spend the night on shore.
Scout everyone the island!

335
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:50,996
Ay, Your Majesty.

336
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:13,946
Seems they have brought a pig.

337
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:20,414
This one. It's female.

338
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,439
So is this one.

339
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,864
This one reads.

340
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:32,098
Let's take her.

341
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:11,322
- There is no escape!
- We are scary.

342
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:14,868
- What are you?
- We are terrifying invisible beasts.

343
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:19,145
If you could see us, you would 
be really intimidated.

344
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:20,919
You forgot to mention that 
we all are very large.

345
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,300
- What do you want?
- You'll do what we ask.

346
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,725
- She will!
- Very clear. Well put!

347
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:31,977
- Or what?
- Or death.

348
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:37,297
Death.

349
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:40,113
Well, I won't be much use to you when
I'm dead now, would I?

350
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:44,912
- I haven't thought of that.
- No, you hadn't. Fair point.

351
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:48,667
Alright. Then 
we'll just kill your friends!

352
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:54,718
- Good idea.
- What do you want with me?

353
00:34:54,822 --> 00:35:00,351
You'll enter the house 
of the Opressor.

354
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:03,063
- What house?
- This one.

355
00:35:08,488 --> 00:35:12,348
Upstairs, you'll find 
the book of incantation,

356
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:15,790
recite the spell 
that makes the unseen, seen.

357
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:21,111
- Well put chief, well put.
- Very. Yeah.

358
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,718
Well, go on.
We haven't got all day.

359
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:26,952
Remember what will 
happen to your friends

360
00:35:26,952 --> 00:35:29,143
- You've been warned.
- Yeah.

361
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,125
Right.

362
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,071
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- We can't read,

363
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:40,409
can't write for the matter of fact.

364
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:43,748
- All that.
- Yeah.

365
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,981
Why didn't you just say so?

366
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:50,424
- Beware of the opressor.
- He is very aggressive!

367
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:58,039
What makes the unseen, seen.
Got it? Don't forget that!

368
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:13,583
Ed, wake up.

369
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:17,651
Wake up!
Look.

370
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:28,500
Where's Lucy?
Lucy!

371
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,795
- Everybody up!
- Get up.

372
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:38,723
- This way.
- Move!

373
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,372
The Book of Incantation

374
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,221
MAXIM TO HEAL PAIN

375
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:38,602
A MAXIM TO FORGET

376
00:37:41,523 --> 00:37:47,991
With these words, your tongue must sew.
For all around there to be snow.

377
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:43,175
An infallible spell to make you she,
the beauty you've always wanted to be.

378
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,614
Susan, what's going on?

379
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:06,543
I'm beautiful.

380
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,374
No! Wait!

381
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:22,816
Make me she, whom I'd agree...

382
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:39,507
Aslan?

383
00:39:54,216 --> 00:39:57,450
A spell to make the unseen, seen.

384
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:04,231
If the 'p' in psychology,
the 'h' in psychiatry...

385
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:07,360
invisible ink and the truth
in theology.

386
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,447
Caspian, Lucy's dagger.

387
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,479
Stop right there or there is!

388
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:26,242
The spell is complete.

389
00:40:26,346 --> 00:40:28,850
Now all is visible.

390
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:52,843
- What sort of creatures are you?
- Great ones.

391
00:40:52,843 --> 00:40:57,850
With the head of a tiger and
the body of um-different tiger.

392
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,875
- You don't want to mess with us!
- Or what?

393
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,422
Or I'll claw you to death!

394
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:08,282
I'll run my touch 
right through you!

395
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,289
- I will crush you with my teeth.
- And i'll bite you with my fangs.

396
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:17,045
You mean squash us
with your fat bellies?

397
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:21,531
- Fatty bellies?
- Or tickle us with your toes?

398
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,869
What have you done with 
my sister, you little pip squid?

399
00:41:27,477 --> 00:41:28,520
- Now, calm down.
- Where is she?

400
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,919
- Can I tell him?
- Tell him, chief!

401
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:33,840
- In the mansion.
- What mansion?

402
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:45,106
Oh. That mansion.

403
00:41:45,106 --> 00:41:48,236
Now, I'm getting tired of you 
leaving me behind.

404
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,157
The thing came back.

405
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:54,808
This place is weirder and weirder.

406
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:56,477
He's calling us "weird".

407
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:08,369
- Lucy! Your majesty.
- Caspian and Edmund.

408
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:10,039
This is Coriakin.
It's his island.

409
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,524
That's what he thinks.
You have wronged us, magician.

410
00:42:14,524 --> 00:42:18,488
I have not wronged you, I've made you
invisible for your own protection.

411
00:42:18,488 --> 00:42:21,618
- Protection?
- That's aggressive! Opressor!

412
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:25,165
- I have not opressed you.
- But you could have!

413
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:29,442
- If you wanted to!
- Be gone!

414
00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:35,597
- What was that?
- Loot. But don't tell them.

415
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:41,856
- What were those things?
- Dufflepuds.

416
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:45,507
Of course.
Silly me.

417
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:51,349
What did you mean when you said you made them
invisible for their own good?

418
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:53,435
It seems to be the easiest way
to protect them,

419
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:56,982
- from the evil.
- You mean the mist?

420
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:01,780
I mean what lies behind the mist.

421
00:43:20,036 --> 00:43:21,705
It's quite beautiful.

422
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:33,180
I mean for a made belived that and
a made believed world.

423
00:43:33,285 --> 00:43:35,267
There is the source of your problems.

424
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:42,986
The Dark Island.
A place where evil lurks.

425
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:49,245
It can take any form. It can make your
darkest dream come true.

426
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:54,461
It seeks to corrupt all goodness

427
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:58,008
Steal the lights from this world.

428
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,138
- How do we stop it?
- You must break its spell.

429
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:06,249
That sword you carry, there
are six others.

430
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,544
- Have you seen them?
- Yes.

431
00:44:08,544 --> 00:44:11,674
- The six lords, they passed through here?
- Indeed.

432
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:15,534
- Where are they heading?
- Where I've sent them.

433
00:44:18,663 --> 00:44:23,357
Break the spell.
You must follow the Blue Star...

434
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:27,217
to Ramandu's Island.

435
00:44:28,156 --> 00:44:30,660
There the seven swords must be laid
at Aslan's table.

436
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,041
Only then can the truly magical power
be released.

437
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,552
But beware. You will
all about to be tested.

438
00:44:42,552 --> 00:45:46,186
Tested?

439
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:57,365
It will do everything in it's power
to tempt you.

440
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:03,833
Be strong...

441
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:09,988
Don't fall to temptations.

442
00:45:10,092 --> 00:45:11,761
To defeat the darkness out there,

443
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:17,812
you must defeat 
the darkness inside yourself.

444
00:45:46,604 --> 00:45:48,168
For reasons beyond 
my comprehension,

445
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:50,881
we have taken the advice 
from the senile old coup,

446
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,532
who doesn't possess a razor, and
walks around on a dressing gown.

447
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,913
So we're back in the bathtub and
and lost in the tempest. Brilliant!

448
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:17,482
14 days of being tossed like a pancake,
not the slightest sight of land.

449
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:25,410
The only consolation is that everyone 
is finally as miserable as I am.

450
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,835
Except for that 
show-off talking rat.

451
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:35,216
He is one of the annoying glass, 
is always half full part.

452
00:46:39,806 --> 00:46:42,935
So, we're stuck here...

453
00:46:43,248 --> 00:46:46,274
with half rations, we have food and 
water for two more weeks maximum.

454
00:46:48,777 --> 00:47:54,498
This is your last chance to
turn back, your majesty.

455
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:57,540
Not in this storm.

456
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:02,026
Like needle in a haystack trying 
to find this remoteless place.

457
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:04,008
We can't sail way past and
knocked to the end of world.

458
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,346
We can be eaten by a Sea Serpent.

459
00:47:08,181 --> 00:47:10,163
You'll see when 
the men are getting nervous.

460
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:14,857
These are strange seas 
we are sailing

461
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:16,839
the lights that which 
I've never seen before.

462
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:20,594
Then perhaps captain, you'd love to be the one
to explain to Mr. Rince that we're abandoning,

463
00:47:20,594 --> 00:47:24,350
the search for his families?

464
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:26,958
I'll get back to it.

465
00:47:29,461 --> 00:47:32,487
Just a word of warning,

466
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:37,077
the seas can play nasty tricks 
on a crew mind.

467
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,998
Very nasty!

468
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:15,779
Transform my reflection, 
cast into affection

469
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,178
lashes, lips and complexion.

470
00:48:18,178 --> 00:48:23,811
Let me like whom I agree,
cause more beauty over me.

471
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:33,809
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ms. Pevensie.

472
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:43,302
- Edmund?
- You look beautiful, Sister.

473
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:44,762
- As always.
- Peter!

474
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:47,996
Excuse me Miss,
Can I get a photo?

475
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:51,960
Mother's gonne love this,
all her children in one picture.

476
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,924
- Smile!
- Hang on. Where am I?

477
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,784
- I mean where's Lucy?
- Lucy, who's Lucy?

478
00:50:00,723 --> 00:50:02,392
Susan, what's wrong?

479
00:50:02,392 --> 00:50:05,209
Come on now Miss.
A nice big smile!

480
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:08,130
Edmund, I'm not sure about this. 
I think I want to go back.

481
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,468
- Go back where?
- To Narnia!

482
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:14,597
- What is Narnia?
- What's going on?

483
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:16,997
Stop this!

484
00:50:23,047 --> 00:50:26,803
- Lucy!
- Aslan?

485
00:50:31,184 --> 00:50:32,853
What have you done, child?

486
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:39,217
I don't know,
but that was awful.

487
00:50:39,634 --> 00:50:41,720
But you chose it, Lucy.

488
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:47,666
I didn't mean to choose all that. I just 
wanted to be as beautiful like Susan.

489
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:50,379
That's all!

490
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:55,803
You wished yourself away,
and with it, much more.

491
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:59,767
Your brothers and sisters wouldn't 
know Narnia without you, Lucy.

492
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,688
You discovered it first, 
remember?

493
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:05,818
I'm so sorry.

494
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:13,433
You doubt your value,
don't run from who you are.

495
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:16,980
Aslan!

496
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:12,269
Father.

497
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:15,502
Edmund.

498
00:52:18,841 --> 00:52:21,449
Come with me.
Join me.

499
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:27,499
Edmund?

500
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:31,255
Lucy.

501
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:40,330
- I can't sleep.
- Let me guess. Bad dream?

502
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:48,571
So either we're all going mad,
or something is playing with our minds.

503
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:13,921
I doubt the Lord stopped here,
there is no sign of anything living.

504
00:53:13,921 --> 00:53:17,363
Right. Well, once you have got on shore, 
take your men for food and water.

505
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:22,475
- The three of us will look for clues.
- You mean the four of us?

506
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:27,899
- Come on, please don't send me back to the rat.
- I heard that!

507
00:53:30,612 --> 00:53:33,741
- Big ears.
- I heard that, too.

508
00:53:51,684 --> 00:53:54,083
Look. We not the first on the island.

509
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:56,483
- The Lords?
- Could be!

510
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:04,202
What do you think 
could be down there?

511
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:07,645
Let's find out!

512
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:48,016
- What is that?
- I don't know. Looks like some kind of a gold statue.

513
00:55:19,207 --> 00:55:21,502
He must have fallen in.

514
00:55:22,128 --> 00:55:24,632
- Poor man.
- You mean, poor Lord.

515
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,430
- The crust of Lord rest in him.
- And his sword.

516
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,038
We need it.

517
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:35,585
Be careful.

518
00:55:38,715 --> 00:55:44,348
- Your sword hasn't turn to gold.
- Both swords are magical.

519
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:51,024
He mustn't have known 
what hit him.

520
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:52,485
Maybe, or maybe
He was onto something.

521
00:55:56,449 --> 00:55:59,265
What are you talking about?

522
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,399
What are you staring at?

523
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:28,579
Whoever has access to this pool could be 
the most powerful person in the world.

524
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:34,838
Lucy, we'll be so rich

525
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:39,219
no one can tell us what to do, 
or who to live with.

526
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:41,201
You can't take anything 
out of Narnia, Edmund.

527
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:46,730
- Who says?
- I do!

528
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:55,284
I am not your subject.

529
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:59,979
You have been waiting for this, haven't you?
To challenge me. You doubt my leadership!

530
00:56:59,979 --> 00:57:01,126
You doubt yourself.

531
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,900
- You're a child.
- And you're a spineless sap.

532
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:05,508
- Edmund?
- I'm tired of playing second fiddle...

533
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:08,116
First it was Peter, 
and now it's you.

534
00:57:08,116 --> 00:57:10,411
You know I am braver 
than both of you.

535
00:57:10,515 --> 00:57:14,583
Why did you Peter's sword?
I deserve a kingdom of my own!

536
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:19,382
- I deserve to rule!
- If you think you're so brave...

537
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:21,886
prove it!

538
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:26,267
No!
Stop it!

539
00:57:26,163 --> 00:57:30,753
Both of you.
Look at yourself.

540
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:33,569
Can't you see what's happenning?

541
00:57:33,361 --> 00:57:35,864
This place has tempted you.

542
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:41,915
It is bewitching you,
This is exactly what Coriakin is talking about.

543
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:45,566
Let's just get outta here.

544
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:13,628
Oh yes, follow the imaginary blue star,
to the island of Rabandoedoe...

545
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:17,592
like the seven steak knives
on the table of a talking lion.

546
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,138
Nonsense!

547
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,970
What is that?

548
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,096
I must be dead.

549
00:59:14,758 --> 00:59:18,096
You are definitely dead.

550
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:26,024
You wouldn't be 
needing that one, won't you.

551
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:45,532
Finally, a favorable 
turn of events.

552
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,007
What foods did you found?

553
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:02,223
It is volcanic, My majesty.
Nothing grows.

554
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,353
Where is Eustace?

555
01:00:05,248 --> 01:00:09,630
I believe he's out not helping us 
loading the boats.

556
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:11,716
Eustace!

557
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:19,748
I have got a bad feeling.

558
01:00:18,705 --> 01:00:20,583
I'm going to find him.

559
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,608
I'll come with you.

560
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:35,918
Eustace?

561
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,785
Treasure.

562
01:00:44,993 --> 01:00:48,019
Trouble.

563
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:59,076
Eustace's.

564
01:01:02,102 --> 01:01:05,231
No.

565
01:01:12,847 --> 01:01:17,228
- I'm sorry.
- He was just a boy.

566
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:21,296
I shouldn't have left him.

567
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:26,617
What could have happened to him?

568
01:01:26,825 --> 01:01:30,268
In this place? 
Anything.

569
01:01:30,268 --> 01:01:33,397
And he wasn't the first.

570
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:38,196
It's Lord Octesian.

571
01:01:39,865 --> 01:01:44,559
We should find this... sword.

572
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:07,405
What was that?

573
01:02:10,222 --> 01:02:13,038
Is it the volcano?

574
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:18,671
Oh no, that's not a volcano.
All hands on deck.

575
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:26,495
Archers, arm yourselves!

576
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:48,506
Take your positions
and wait for my command.

577
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,460
- What is it doing?
- Fire!

578
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:06,136
He will break the mast.

579
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,586
Hold your positions.

580
01:03:16,881 --> 01:03:19,906
Fire!

581
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:50,367
Edmund!

582
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:58,191
- Edmund!
- Lucy.

583
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:22,289
I AM EUSTACE

584
01:04:23,436 --> 01:04:27,922
You've got to be joking!

585
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:40,544
He must have been 
tempted by the treasure.

586
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:42,109
Everyone knows that 
the dragon's treasure is enchanted.

587
01:04:43,883 --> 01:04:46,491
Apart anyone from here.

588
01:05:00,574 --> 01:05:05,477
- Is there any way to change him back?
- Not that I know of.

589
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:10,797
Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.

590
01:05:10,797 --> 01:05:15,595
Sorry about the hand, oh boy.
I can be a little over zealous sometimes.

591
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:19,351
- The boats are ready, sire.
- We can not leave him.

592
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:22,167
Well, we can't bring him 
on board, Your Majesty.

593
01:05:23,106 --> 01:05:26,132
You and others take one boat back.
The rest of us stay here until morning,

594
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:29,157
- work out what to do.
- But you have no provisions,

595
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:31,973
and no means of 
staying warm, My Majesty

596
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:38,024
And you were saying?

597
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:49,186
I've never seen 
these constellation before.

598
01:05:49,186 --> 01:05:52,315
Me neither.

599
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,549
We are long way from home.

600
01:05:55,549 --> 01:06:00,244
When I was a boy I used to imagine 
sailing to the end of the world,

601
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:03,999
to find my father there.

602
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:08,589
Maybe you are!

603
01:06:21,212 --> 01:06:24,967
I miss my mommy.

604
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:30,079
I miss mine, too.

605
01:06:29,974 --> 01:06:32,895
Don't worry, you'll see her again.

606
01:06:32,895 --> 01:06:37,277
- How do you know?
- You just have to have faith about these things.

607
01:06:37,277 --> 01:06:40,824
Aslan will help us.

608
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:49,586
But Aslan could have 
stopped her from being taken.

609
01:06:49,586 --> 01:06:53,655
We'll find her, I promise.

610
01:06:53,655 --> 01:06:57,202
Somehow.

611
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:24,220
Trouble sleeping?

612
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:31,001
Now now, 
all is not lost as it seems.

613
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:34,235
I'll stay up with you if you wish.
To keep you company.

614
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:39,763
You didn't even believe 
in dragons this morning.

615
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:48,318
You know, extraordinary things
only happen to extraordinary people.

616
01:07:50,613 --> 01:07:51,864
Maybe it's a sign!

617
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:56,246
That you've got 
an extraordinary destiny

618
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:01,879
Something greater 
than you could have imagine.

619
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:09,286
I can tell you one or two of my adventures
if you like, just past the time.

620
01:08:09,703 --> 01:08:13,354
Believe it or not, you are not the
first dragon I've encountered.

621
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:15,858
Many years ago,
too many that I care to imagine.

622
01:08:16,171 --> 01:08:19,509
I was with a band of pirates
and I met another dragon,

623
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:20,865
much fierce than you.

624
01:08:33,696 --> 01:08:35,991
Lucy, wake up!

625
01:08:36,304 --> 01:08:39,225
Look!

626
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:41,207
The Blue Star.

627
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:45,171
- Everybody up.
- What?

628
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,031
- It is the blue star.
- Wake up.

629
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,402
Pull.

630
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:32,949
Put your strokes in there, lads!
Pull!

631
01:09:34,514 --> 01:09:36,287
The wind has left.

632
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:39,730
So how do we get to 
Ramandu Island now then?

633
01:09:40,981 --> 01:09:43,172
My guess is something 
doesn't want us to get there.

634
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:47,658
Pull.

635
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:53,187
If I'm getting hungrier,
I'm gonna eat that dragon!

636
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:58,403
Don't worry, Eustace. They will
to deal with me first.

637
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:02,888
If we don't get to landfall by tonight,
they might as well eat them...

638
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:10,086
What are we hitting?

639
01:10:13,216 --> 01:10:17,388
Eustace, that's brilliant!

640
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,673
En Route!

641
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:50,979
We can't be sure that the other Lords even
made it to Ramandu's Island.

642
01:11:01,932 --> 01:11:08,609
You got us there! What did I tell you?
Eustace, you're extraordinary!

643
01:12:02,437 --> 01:12:05,254
Wait.

644
01:12:40,722 --> 01:12:42,704
Lord Revilian.

645
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:49,693
Lord Mavramorn.

646
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:55,118
Lord Argoz.

647
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,341
He's breathing!

648
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:13,061
So are they?

649
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:17,964
They're under the spell.

650
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:20,780
It's the food!

651
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:27,978
Hey, it's the stone knife.
This is Aslan's table!

652
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:30,482
The swords.

653
01:13:38,932 --> 01:13:41,122
Let me take it.

654
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:51,867
That's six.

655
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:55,831
We're missing one.

656
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:01,360
Look!

657
01:14:27,022 --> 01:14:29,630
Travellers of Narnia

658
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:31,612
Welcome.

659
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,368
Arise!

660
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:40,688
- Do you look hungry?
- Who are you?

661
01:14:40,688 --> 01:14:42,357
I am Lilliandil.

662
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:44,757
Daughter of Ramandu.

663
01:14:44,757 --> 01:14:47,156
I am your guide.

664
01:14:49,972 --> 01:14:53,415
You're a star.

665
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:01,656
You're most beautiful.

666
01:15:01,656 --> 01:15:06,455
If it is a distraction for you, I can
change forms./No!

667
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:10,315
Please!

668
01:15:10,627 --> 01:15:13,966
The food is for you.

669
01:15:13,966 --> 01:15:17,825
There is enough for everyone
that welcome to Aslan's table.

670
01:15:18,034 --> 01:15:21,164
Always. Help yourselves.

671
01:15:22,207 --> 01:15:24,189
Wait.

672
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:26,484
What happened to them?

673
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,344
These poor men were half mad
by the time they reached our shores.

674
01:15:30,552 --> 01:15:36,290
They threatened each other with violence.
Violence is forbidden at the table of Aslan.

675
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:40,463
- So they were sent to sleep.
- Will they ever awake?

676
01:15:40,358 --> 01:15:43,070
When all is put right.

677
01:15:43,488 --> 01:15:46,304
Come. There is little time.

678
01:16:01,743 --> 01:16:06,333
The Magician Coriakin told you
of Dark Island?

679
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:09,254
Yes.

680
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,452
For long, the evil 
used to be unstoppable.

681
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:20,834
Coriakin said, to break the spell,
we need the seventh sword on the Aslan's table.

682
01:16:20,834 --> 01:16:24,589
- He speaks the truth.
- But we found only six.

683
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:26,884
Do you know 
where the seventh is?

684
01:16:27,927 --> 01:16:29,388
In there.

685
01:16:29,388 --> 01:16:33,039
You will need great courage.

686
01:16:38,046 --> 01:16:42,010
Now, don't waste your time.

687
01:16:43,262 --> 01:16:46,392
How we meet again?

688
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:50,669
Goodbye.

689
01:17:15,079 --> 01:17:18,313
So what do you think it's in there?

690
01:17:18,313 --> 01:17:20,504
Our worst nightmares.

691
01:17:20,504 --> 01:17:23,529
Our darkest wishes.

692
01:17:23,425 --> 01:17:26,346
Pure evil.

693
01:17:28,954 --> 01:17:32,813
Tavros, unlock the armory

694
01:17:32,813 --> 01:17:36,778
Archers, prepare yourselves.

695
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,177
Dock the lanterns.

696
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:41,472
Let's get ready.

697
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:50,756
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

698
01:17:57,641 --> 01:18:00,145
When you grow up,

699
01:18:01,501 --> 01:18:05,361
you should be just like you.

700
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,897
If case we don't get through,

701
01:18:15,897 --> 01:18:18,505
whatever this is...

702
01:18:18,505 --> 01:18:21,947
I want you to 
think of me as your brother.

703
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,242
Me too.

704
01:18:27,685 --> 01:18:30,502
You gave up your sword.

705
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:33,527
It was not mine to keep.

706
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:39,369
Use this.

707
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:43,020
- But it is...
- Peter would like you to have it.

708
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:56,060
Here it is, my friend.
The battle awaits.

709
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:00,441
Eustace, no. Wait.

710
01:19:00,337 --> 01:19:03,362
Stop.

711
01:19:04,196 --> 01:19:10,038
I will not accept surrender.
A true warrior does not flight out of fear.

712
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:12,959
Look at me 
when I'm talking to you.

713
01:19:15,254 --> 01:19:19,844
I'm a mouse.
You a dragon.

714
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:24,121
You have a skin of leather.
You breathe fire.

715
01:19:23,913 --> 01:19:26,729
Come on, let's meet our destiny.

716
01:19:33,718 --> 01:19:36,326
No matter what happens here,

717
01:19:36,222 --> 01:19:41,229
every soul standing before me, has earned 
a place on the Dawn Treader.

718
01:19:42,273 --> 01:19:44,568
Together we traveled far.

719
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:48,114
Together, we have faced diversity.
Together...

720
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:50,201
we can do it again.

721
01:19:50,514 --> 01:19:55,104
So now is not the time to fall in fears and
temptations. Be strong!

722
01:19:54,686 --> 01:19:56,877
Never give in.

723
01:19:57,086 --> 01:20:02,197
Our world, our Narnian lives
depend on it.

724
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,953
Think of the lost souls
we are here to save.

725
01:20:08,874 --> 01:20:11,169
Think of Aslan.

726
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:16,906
- Think of Narnia.
- For Narnia!

727
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,766
For Narnia!

728
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,245
Helene?

729
01:21:27,843 --> 01:21:30,659
We can't see a thing.

730
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:33,476
The fog is too thick.

731
01:21:39,213 --> 01:21:42,343
You're a great disappointment 
to me.

732
01:21:42,343 --> 01:21:44,534
You call yourself my son?

733
01:21:44,534 --> 01:21:48,498
And act like a king.

734
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:52,462
Edmund.

735
01:21:53,192 --> 01:21:55,278
Come with me.

736
01:21:55,487 --> 01:21:58,304
Be my king.

737
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:02,685
- I let you rule.
- Go away.

738
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:06,649
- You're dead.
- You can never kill me.

739
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:11,656
I will always be alive
in your mind, silly boy.

740
01:22:11,656 --> 01:22:15,203
- No!
- Edmund?

741
01:22:15,829 --> 01:22:18,959
Are you alright?

742
01:22:29,599 --> 01:22:33,355
Keep away!

743
01:22:33,876 --> 01:22:37,945
- Keep away!
- Who's there?

744
01:22:37,945 --> 01:22:43,056
- We will not fear you!
- Not, are you?

745
01:22:51,193 --> 01:22:55,157
- Keep away!
- We do not leave.

746
01:22:54,531 --> 01:22:56,931
You will not defeat me.

747
01:22:56,826 --> 01:23:01,103
Caspian, the sword!

748
01:23:01,834 --> 01:23:04,755
Lord Rhoop.

749
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:11,222
- You cannot own me!
- Stand down.

750
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:14,039
Let's get him onboard, quickly!

751
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:27,183
- Be calm my Lord.
- Off me, demons!

752
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:30,104
We're not here to hurt you.
I am your king.

753
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:33,129
Caspian.

754
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,640
My Lord.

755
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,917
You should not have come.
There is no way out of here.

756
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:48,151
Quickly turn this ship about
before it is too late.

757
01:23:48,151 --> 01:23:50,029
We have the sword!
Let's go!

758
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:53,054
Let's turn this ship around.

759
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:54,201
Do not think.

760
01:23:55,245 --> 01:23:59,939
Do not let it know your fears,
or it will become them!

761
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:04,007
- Oh no!
- Edmund.

762
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:07,763
- What did you just think of?
- I'm sorry.

763
01:24:23,411 --> 01:24:25,914
What is that?

764
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,670
It's too late!

765
01:24:32,591 --> 01:24:36,033
Get off there!

766
01:24:45,109 --> 01:24:47,300
Come, walk!

767
01:24:47,717 --> 01:24:51,890
Don't let me down.
No fear. No retreats.

768
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:04,929
For Narnia! Take that!

769
01:25:05,764 --> 01:25:08,163
And that!

770
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:10,458
Eustace, hang on!

771
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:42,588
- I'll kill it.
- No, the sword!

772
01:25:41,858 --> 01:25:44,988
Eustace!

773
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:49,160
- Come back.
- We are doomed. Doomed!

774
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:53,124
- Turn this ship about.
- Stop him.

775
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:04,078
Rowers.
To your rowing position.

776
01:26:03,765 --> 01:26:09,085
- Forward at double speed.
- Aslan, please help us.

777
01:26:15,657 --> 01:26:18,057
Pull.

778
01:26:38,816 --> 01:26:41,424
Pull!

779
01:26:48,309 --> 01:26:50,395
Where are you?

780
01:27:02,288 --> 01:27:06,043
You must stay here until 
someone comes and get you!

781
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:16,579
Ed! We run the serpent, 
smash him on the rocks.

782
01:27:15,953 --> 01:27:20,126
Stay on the port, 
I will keep it on the ground.

783
01:27:20,648 --> 01:27:23,568
Look out!

784
01:27:26,489 --> 01:27:28,680
Pull!

785
01:27:35,565 --> 01:27:39,738
Try to kill me, come on!
Come on here.

786
01:27:42,241 --> 01:27:45,580
- No!
- Edmund.

787
01:28:02,584 --> 01:28:06,235
I'm still here.

788
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:14,789
Brace yourselves!

789
01:29:26,873 --> 01:29:30,211
Move!

790
01:29:43,564 --> 01:29:46,485
We can beat this.

791
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:06,722
- We must get closer.
- Everybody to the main deck.

792
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:10,165
Get ready.

793
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,050
I want everyone here.

794
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:22,996
Ready...

795
01:30:22,579 --> 01:30:25,708
now!

796
01:30:29,568 --> 01:30:33,011
Put his head down!

797
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:56,065
Heave!

798
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:13,591
What are you trying
to prove, Edmund?

799
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:16,720
That you are a man?

800
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,673
Do it!

801
01:31:27,673 --> 01:31:32,055
I can make you that.
I can make you my king.

802
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:36,228
Just take my hand.

803
01:31:48,746 --> 01:31:52,501
Just give it here.

804
01:32:00,429 --> 01:32:02,412
Do it!

805
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:05,645
Come on!

806
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:10,444
No!

807
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:46,747
The spell, it has lifted.

808
01:32:52,171 --> 01:32:57,387
Edmund, Caspian, Look!

809
01:33:23,363 --> 01:33:27,640
Narnians!

810
01:33:42,036 --> 01:33:46,104
- Mommy!
- Helene.

811
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:05,299
Mommy.

812
01:34:09,263 --> 01:34:12,914
Let's have them 
onboard, clear the decks.

813
01:34:14,687 --> 01:34:19,277
We did it.
I knew we would.

814
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:21,885
- It wasn't just us.
- You mean?

815
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:26,892
I'm here, Lucy.

816
01:34:26,788 --> 01:34:30,752
Here, Lucy.
I'm in the water.

817
01:34:30,752 --> 01:34:34,925
I am a boy again.
A boy!

818
01:34:35,029 --> 01:34:38,472
Eustace! I see your wings 
have been clipped.

819
01:34:40,767 --> 01:34:46,817
Where sky and water meet,
where the waves grow ever sweet.

820
01:34:45,774 --> 01:34:49,634
It's sweet!

821
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:54,641
Look.

822
01:35:00,066 --> 01:35:03,091
Aslan's country.

823
01:35:02,674 --> 01:35:04,969
We must have be close.

824
01:35:04,969 --> 01:35:08,724
Well, we've come so far.

825
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:23,642
So what was it like?
When Aslan changed you back?

826
01:35:23,642 --> 01:35:29,171
No matter how hard i tried,
I just couldn't do it myself.

827
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:32,300
Then he came towards me.
It was sort of hurt, but...

828
01:35:32,509 --> 01:35:35,117
It was good pay.

829
01:35:35,117 --> 01:35:38,872
Like when you pull 
a sword from your foot.

830
01:35:38,872 --> 01:35:40,854
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.

831
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:45,236
I mean I was a better dragon
than a boy, really.

832
01:35:45,236 --> 01:35:48,157
I'm so sorry for being such a sob

833
01:35:48,157 --> 01:35:52,955
It's okay Eustace.
You were a pretty good dragon.

834
01:35:56,293 --> 01:36:00,988
My friends, 
we've arrived

835
01:36:37,603 --> 01:36:39,898
Aslan.

836
01:36:39,898 --> 01:36:42,715
Welcome, children.
You have done well.

837
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:46,366
Very well indeed.
You have come far.

838
01:36:46,366 --> 01:36:48,661
Now your journey 
is at it's end.

839
01:36:48,661 --> 01:36:53,877
- Is this your country?
- No, my country lies beyond.

840
01:36:57,111 --> 01:37:01,492
- Is my father in your country?
- You can only find that out on yourself, my son.

841
01:37:01,597 --> 01:37:06,291
But you should know that 
if you continue, there is no return.

842
01:37:38,734 --> 01:37:40,612
You not going?

843
01:37:40,716 --> 01:37:46,245
Can't imagine my father would be 
very proud that I gave up what he died for.

844
01:37:48,331 --> 01:37:51,982
I spent too long wanting what have been 
taken from me, not what was given.

845
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,947
I was given a kingdom.

846
01:37:55,947 --> 01:37:59,702
People.

847
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:08,673
- I promise to be a better king.
- You already are.

848
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,968
Children.

849
01:38:11,281 --> 01:38:14,724
I think perhaps it's time 
we went home actually then?

850
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:19,940
- I thought you loved it here?
- I do!

851
01:38:20,253 --> 01:38:25,886
But I love home
and our family as well!

852
01:38:27,138 --> 01:38:30,372
They need us.

853
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:42,890
Your eminence, ever since I can remember, I've
dreamt of seeing your country

854
01:38:43,203 --> 01:38:49,358
I have had many great adventures in this world,
but nothing has dampen that yearning.

855
01:38:49,358 --> 01:38:53,322
I know I'm hardly worthy,
but with your permission...

856
01:38:53,322 --> 01:38:57,390
I'd lay down my sword for 
the joy of seeing your country,

857
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,937
with my own eyes.

858
01:39:03,128 --> 01:39:08,031
My country was made for 
noble hearts such as yours.

859
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:10,430
No matter 
how small that can be.

860
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:14,603
- Your majesty.
- Nobody deserves it more.

861
01:39:14,603 --> 01:39:17,836
It's true.

862
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:36,614
- May I?
- Well, I suppose...just this..

863
01:39:40,369 --> 01:39:42,560
Goodbye, Lucy.

864
01:39:57,999 --> 01:39:58,938
Don't cry.

865
01:39:58,938 --> 01:40:01,546
I don't understand.

866
01:40:03,424 --> 01:40:07,909
When will I see you again?

867
01:40:07,909 --> 01:40:10,309
What a magnificent puzzle 
you are.

868
01:40:10,309 --> 01:40:11,247
And a true hero.

869
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:15,629
It has been my honor to fight 
beside such a brave warrior.

870
01:40:16,046 --> 01:40:17,820
And a great friend.

871
01:40:30,964 --> 01:40:34,302
I won't be needing this.

872
01:41:00,381 --> 01:41:04,241
- This is our last time here, isn't it?
- Yes.

873
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:07,475
You have grown up, my dear one.

874
01:41:07,371 --> 01:41:11,543
- Just like Peter and Susan.
- Will you visit us in our world?

875
01:41:12,795 --> 01:41:14,986
I shall be watching you always.

876
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:20,411
- How?
- In your world...

877
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:24,896
I have another name.
You must learn to know me by it.

878
01:41:25,314 --> 01:41:29,278
That was the very reason 
you were brought to Narnia.

879
01:41:29,278 --> 01:41:34,389
That by knowing me here for a little,
You'll know me better there.

880
01:41:35,015 --> 01:41:37,310
Will we meet again?

881
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:41,587
Yes, dear one. One day.

882
01:41:56,818 --> 01:42:00,260
You are closest to me 
I have as family.

883
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:05,059
And that includes you, Eustace.

884
01:42:05,372 --> 01:42:07,458
Thank you.

885
01:42:34,268 --> 01:42:36,041
Will I come back?

886
01:42:36,041 --> 01:42:39,380
Narnia may yet of need of you.

887
01:43:36,546 --> 01:43:43,744
Eustace! 
What are you doing up there?

888
01:43:43,744 --> 01:43:46,769
Jill drops in for a visit.

889
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:01,791
We spoke often of Narnia 
in the days that follow.

890
01:44:03,043 --> 01:44:06,798
And when all my cousins have left.

891
01:44:06,798 --> 01:44:08,780
After the war ended...

892
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:12,953
I missed them with all my heart.

893
01:44:12,953 --> 01:44:16,500
As I know all Narnians 
will miss them,

894
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,255
till the end of time.
