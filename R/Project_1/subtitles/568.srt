1
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:12,693
<i> I'm pretty hungry.
I hope we catch some fish soon. </i>

2
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,102
<i> Me too. </i>

3
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,698
- Okay, help me wind.
- Wind back?

4
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:20,211
Can we turn this one?
Slowly.

5
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,645
Slowly, slowly,
slowly, slowly.

6
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,548
- I am doing it slowly.
- Okay, you got it.

7
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,586
Oh, Matty, look!

8
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:30,121
- You see that big boat out there?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:35,991
<i>She is the prettiest boat on Whidbey
Island. That's the Morning Star. </i>

10
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,155
Someday when you're big enough,
I'm gonna teach you how to sail.

11
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,995
<i>- It's the best thing there is, sailing.
- Better than fishing?</i>

12
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:45,400
Yup.
But you know what, kiddo?

13
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:48,440
- I don't think I want you to grow up.
- Why?

14
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,498
<i>What if you grow up
and marry some beautiful girl?</i>

15
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:54,512
- Who's gonna go sailing with me then?
- Dad.

16
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,480
Not a chance.

17
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,754
Thank you so much.

18
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,492
<i>Nick. Uh, we need to talk. </i>

19
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,594
Always happy to talk to you, Rudy.
Hey, Warren.

20
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,663
Did you get that notice
from First Seattle today?

21
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,038
Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

22
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,373
- Good.
- Then you know.

23
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:30,438
- We've got a real problem.
- First Seattle is not a problem.

24
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,178
These martinis are a problem.
Do you mind?

25
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:36,346
<i>- Not at all.
- Where were we? Right, First Seattle.</i>

26
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,559
- Mommy?
- Hey, kiddo.

27
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:44,084
<i>- How's it going?
- Hand off.</i>

28
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:48,732
- Oh, you sack of potatoes.
- Ay-yi-yi.

29
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,099
Have you been carrying him
around the whole party?

30
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,297
- Yeah.
- We're never gonna marry you, Angie.

31
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:58,071
Mm, yes. Picasso.

32
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,304
Blue Period.

33
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,507
<i>The artist's name is Kandinsky. </i>

34
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:05,516
Wassily Kandinsky.

35
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:10,078
He was German, of Russian extraction,
1866 to 1944.

36
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,783
And by the way,
Picasso's Blue Period was figurative...

37
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,053
and ended in 1904.

38
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:19,393
And these watercolors
are abstract, done in 1911.

39
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,497
Picasso.

40
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,669
Everyone pipe down.
I'm about to give a speech.

41
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,679
<i>Thank you for coming.
I always say the sign of a good party... </i>

42
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,079
is when I'm having a better time
than anyone else, but...

43
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:39,379
now is the time when you're
expected to ante up...

44
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:41,749
for drinking all my liquor,
and eating all my food...

45
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,450
and spilling tomato sauce
on my couch, Bobby Long.

46
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:50,120
<i>-  Ooh...
- What, you didn't think I saw you?</i>

47
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:53,062
- Oh, he's insufferable.
- I know it.

48
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,124
<i>Now, we are here to raise a vast sum
of money for the Small Frye School. </i>

49
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,160
<i>So, while you are reaching
for your checkbooks... </i>

50
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,639
it gives me great pleasure to
introduce Mrs. Rebecca Tingley...

51
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,903
<i>our totally ravishing... </i>

52
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,969
<i>and completely adorable Headmistress. </i>

53
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,644
Mr. Parsons, thank you.

54
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,483
<i>First of all, I'd like
to start by introducing... </i>

55
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:20,787
- a few members of my staff to you today.
- Oh, God.

56
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,589
I give you our dedicated teacher
and Head of Admissions...

57
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:25,596
Miss Angela Green.

58
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:28,497
Yea!

59
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:33,004
Me!

60
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,844
What are you thinking about?

61
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,853
Was I always as rude as I am now?

62
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,185
Absolutely.

63
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:04,530
Hi.
Come have a seat.

64
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,643
Angela, do you think we ought
to break the news to her?

65
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,843
I suppose it's better she hears it
from us than from someone else.

66
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,284
She's not gonna be
happy about it.

67
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:24,481
What's up, guys?

68
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,491
Close your eyes.

69
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,494
Close 'em.

70
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:34,498
Okay, now, stand up.

71
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,126
Keep 'em closed.

72
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,540
<i>Now, Libby,
what is your favorite thing?</i>

73
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,137
- Me?
- Not even close.

74
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,474
All right, open.

75
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,089
<i>I heard Sean Gittman
was thinking of selling. </i>

76
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,091
<i>I made him an offer... </i>

77
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,093
and he agreed to let us
take her out for the weekend.

78
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,527
And if you like it, it's yours.

79
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:07,156
<i>- If I like it?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

80
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,723
<i>Honey, we can't afford that. </i>

81
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,099
<i>When have I ever let that
get in my way? Come on. </i>

82
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,162
Huh?

83
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,070
What about Matty?

84
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:18,541
I'll take care of him.
We'll have a great time.

85
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,704
<i>You hate to sail.</i>

86
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,011
I can learn.

87
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,811
Huh?

88
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:57,439
<i>Generally, wine like this
needs time to breathe... </i>

89
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:00,679
but I don't know,
I don't think we should...

90
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,686
wait.

91
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,723
I don't see land.

92
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,424
So where is it?

93
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,964
Alaska's over that way,
Japan is straight ahead...

94
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,762
and Australia's
somewhere to the left.

95
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,769
Where would you like to go?

96
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,737
Bed.

97
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:23,673
That can be arranged.

98
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:11,420
We should do this more often.

99
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,516
What do you mean?
Buy expensive sailboats?

100
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:17,562
If this is what happens,
I'll buy another one tomorrow.

101
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,225
No, go away, just the two of us...

102
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,599
with nobody else around.

103
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,234
I'll drink to that.

104
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,687
Nick?

105
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,790
Nick?

106
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,858
Oh, my God.
Nick?

107
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,272
<i>Nick?</i>

108
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:16,921
Nick? Ni...

109
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:20,549
<i>Oh, my God. </i>

110
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:37,908
Nick?

111
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:50,378
Nick!
Nick!

112
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,282
<i>Nick!
Oh, my God. </i>

113
00:09:56,828 --> 00:10:00,992
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

114
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,000
Nick?

115
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,600
<i>Morning Star, this is the Coast Guard. </i>

116
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:10,937
<i>Put the knife down,
ma'am, and step away. </i>

117
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,671
I- I don't...
I don't know...

118
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,579
I don't know...
where my husband is!

119
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,243
...search for local businessman...

120
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:23,889
Nick Parsons, who disappeared
in these waters off Whidbey Island.

121
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,257
All right, tie it off.

122
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,667
<i>- Hey, Cutter.
- Hey, Tom. What have you got for me?</i>

123
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:56,479
<i>- Anything?
- No.</i>

124
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,250
Cutter, please don't let them give up.
He's very strong.

125
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:02,657
- Libby. L-Libby.
- He's a very strong man.

126
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:09,831
The raft and life preservers
are all on board.

127
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:14,634
These guys,
they tracked the wind, currents...

128
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,300
Nothing.
The water temperature overnight...

129
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:22,312
was 51 degrees.

130
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,144
That's cold. That's really cold.

131
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,648
- Cutter, I can't breathe!
- Just put your head down.

132
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,916
Yeah, that's it.
Deep breaths.

133
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,015
Big breaths.

134
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,587
Shh.

135
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,753
Mommy, look!

136
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,695
Hi, kiddo.

137
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,506
Hey, Bobby.

138
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,208
Hey, Libby.

139
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,111
Um, well, Cutter, he, uh...

140
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,547
<i>He asked me to come by
and talk to you, you know. </i>

141
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:35,677
<i>Just, um...
Not as an attorney, just as a friend. </i>

142
00:12:38,056 --> 00:12:40,854
The inquest was held this morning,
and they reviewed all the evidence...

143
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:44,952
and Nick, uh, well,
he's officially been declared dead.

144
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:50,161
<i>Now, Libby, they, um... </i>

145
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:53,932
<i>they've determined it was
a "wrongful death, and you... </i>

146
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:58,601
Oh, Jesus, you... You're being
formally charged with his murder.

147
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,610
<i>I am here to advise you. </i>

148
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:03,408
<i>Make no statements
whatsoever to the sheriff. </i>

149
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,776
<i>I'm sorry, Libby. </i>

150
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,824
<i>Cutter!</i>

151
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:17,589
Not in front of my kid, okay?

152
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,889
I'm sorry, Libby.
Uh, the judge denied us bail.

153
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:02,164
Can Angie keep looking after Matty?

154
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:08,538
<i>Good. Okay, uh... </i>

155
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:12,548
<i>- Let's look at this, see what we can do.
- Bobby.</i>

156
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:14,846
<i>Here's what
I think happened. </i>

157
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,284
I had some wine, okay?

158
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,756
And I fell asleep.
It must have been the sun.

159
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:26,660
<i>And maybe Nick was trying
to cut a snagged line or something... </i>

160
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,257
because the knife...

161
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:32,529
from the galley
was on deck.

162
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:36,733
And-And maybe the boat
pitched or something...

163
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,775
and he cut himself.

164
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:42,107
And he tried to come downstairs.
He tried to come below...

165
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,875
to wake me up.

166
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,953
I quit these things
when I met Nick.

167
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:03,061
It'll be all right.
I promise you.

168
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:08,599
<i>So. Why don't we take a look
at this First Guarantee Life?</i>

169
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,368
Now. You both bought
life insurance policies...

170
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,469
from the company
around four months ago.

171
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:22,582
- And you are the beneficiary.
- I'm his wife.

172
00:15:22,653 --> 00:15:25,053
Libby, you know this policy is
worth two million?

173
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:28,489
Nick wanted to make sure that if
anything happened to him, we'd be okay.

174
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,585
The jury may feel there's a difference
between "okay" and $2 million.

175
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:34,062
<i>They may see it as a motive. </i>

176
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:36,565
- Is that what they're saying?
- No, no one is saying that.

177
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:41,263
- I don't think we have to be concerned...
- That I killed Nick for money?

178
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:47,233
I know we had some problems,
and Nick worried...

179
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,245
- but we were okay!
- Libby!

180
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:52,510
Two of his investors
were suing him for embezzlement.

181
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,108
First Seattle issued a lien on
all of his real estate properties...

182
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:57,449
your personal possessions...

183
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,580
Now, Nick's death means
all these problems disappear...

184
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:04,093
<i>behind a corporate shield,
leaving you with $2 million. </i>

185
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:10,792
- Do you think I killed him?
- The first rule of being a lawyer.

186
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,926
What we think doesn't matter.

187
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:15,301
It matters to me.

188
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:21,203
No. Of course.
I don't think you killed him.

189
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:28,008
<i> Petty Officer Young,
what was the condition... </i>

190
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,851
<i>of the Morning Star's marine band radio
when you had a chance to inspect it?</i>

191
00:16:31,922 --> 00:16:34,220
The handset cord
had been cut.

192
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,158
<i>And as you initially
approached the sailboat... </i>

193
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:40,025
what did you see?

194
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,861
Mrs. Parsons
was holding a knife.

195
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:51,139
I show you State's exhibit...
number four.

196
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,301
Uh, Mayday. Mayday.

197
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,242
<i>This is the Morning Star. </i>

198
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:57,906
<i>State your emergency, Morning Star.</i>

199
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,972
<i>I've been stabbed. </i>

200
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,451
<i>I'm bleeding, uh...
Oh, Jesus. </i>

201
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>My na...
My name's Nicholas Parsons. </i>

202
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:09,918
<i>-  State your position.
- I don't know, man. </i>

203
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:15,192
<i>Three miles northwest of,
uh, of Whidbey Island, I guess. </i>

204
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:18,894
Oh, God! Oh, God!

205
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:22,234
<i> Mrs. Parsons, you've heard
the testimony presented to this court... </i>

206
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:27,538
<i>and your explanation is that somebody
must have come aboard the Morning Star. </i>

207
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:33,516
- That's right.
- Let's consider all the possibilities.

208
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,983
Maybe a band of pirates.

209
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,386
Or aliens!
Did aliens murder your husband?

210
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:43,017
No. Aliens weren't beneficiaries in...

211
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,459
<i>- your husband's life insurance policy.
- Objection.</i>

212
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,622
<i>- Your Honor, the prosecutor...
- Overruled.</i>

213
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,599
- I told you what happened.
- Yes, you did.

214
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:54,068
- You told us that you were asleep.
- Yes.

215
00:17:54,137 --> 00:17:57,436
<i>Maybe you were sleepwalking
when you stabbed your husband. </i>

216
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:58,496
<i>Objection. </i>

217
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:01,100
<i>Is Miss Halliwell questioning the
witness, or making a closing argument?</i>

218
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:05,877
- Withdrawn.
- I didn't kill my husband!

219
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,940
I loved my husband.

220
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:16,524
Bobby, I did not
kill my husband!

221
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,653
You have to believe me.

222
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:37,411
<i>I'm-I'm sorry, Libby. </i>

223
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:42,447
It's not your fault, Bobby.

224
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:55,094
I want to ask you
something, Angie.

225
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,601
I'd like you to adopt my son.

226
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,833
No, Lib, I can't do that.
Not to you.

227
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,705
<i>I've thought it through. </i>

228
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:10,713
I barely survived my parents' house.
I'm not gonna put him there.

229
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:16,710
<i>Money won't be a problem
because there's the $2 million... </i>

230
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:19,483
from the life insurance, and it's going
into a trust fund in his name.

231
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:23,492
- It isn't about money.
- I know.

232
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:30,158
Matty loves you.

233
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,695
We can't let him become
a ward of the state.

234
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,746
Thank you.

235
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,747
Hey, kiddo.

236
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,918
Come see me.

237
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,898
You're gonna go stay with Angie
for a while. Okay, kiddo?

238
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,901
Okay.

239
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,530
And you're gonna have lots of fun...

240
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:13,042
and I know you're gonna be
a good boy, right?

241
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:15,236
<i>Yes, Mommy. </i>

242
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:18,509
<i>And as soon as
all this is over... </i>

243
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:22,313
we'll be together again.

244
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:24,785
That's a promise, kiddo.

245
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:26,858
Okay?

246
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,786
I love you.

247
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,422
I love you, too.

248
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:32,417
<i>- Who's this?
- Rich bitch from Whidbey Island. </i>

249
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,927
- She ain't gonna make it.
- What do you think... a year?

250
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:41,124
<i>Five cartons says she offs herself
inside of six months. </i>

251
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,826
- Deal.
- Get away from me.

252
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:46,369
Hey, take it easy.
We're you new best friends.

253
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:49,873
Heard you did your husband.
Probably deserved it.

254
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,000
Mine did.

255
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,066
<i> I know what a pain
it is to get here. </i>

256
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,900
- I taught him how to say the ABC's.
- Is that true?

257
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,907
- Sing it, Matty. Go!
- Yes.

258
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,409
Did you learn
the alphabet, sweetie?

259
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:28,411
- Yeah.
- Can you tell me?

260
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:07,250
Give it up. Come on.

261
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:10,685
Get off the phone, bitch. Jesus.

262
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:48,858
Whoa, you're low on cigarettes.

263
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,860
If you want to make
any friends...

264
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,862
I advise you buy
another pack fast...

265
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,795
on account of
your personality...

266
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:56,799
It ain't the best
I've ever seen.

267
00:23:56,867 --> 00:24:00,166
Hear you're tryin' to reach your friend,
the one with your boy.

268
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:02,865
Yeah, I can't find 'em.
They disappeared.

269
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,239
Oh, hon...
If you could disappear that easy...

270
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,244
believe you me,
I wouldn't be here right now.

271
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:10,246
Me either.

272
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,716
Think. Use your head.

273
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:19,278
There's gotta be a way
to track 'em down.

274
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:31,959
- Small Frye School, front office.
- Shh! Shh!

275
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,061
Hello, this is
Angela Green calling.

276
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,368
- Angie, it's Jennifer.
- Yes, hi. How are you?

277
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,874
- Good to hear from you.
- Yes, it's nice to hear your voice.

278
00:24:38,943 --> 00:24:42,140
Listen, I haven't gotten
a severance check in a while...

279
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,647
and I was hoping
I could verify with you...

280
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,945
that you have my correct mailing address
and phone number.

281
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:50,180
- I'll check. Can you hold on a sec?
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

282
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:57,720
Yeah, I have it right here.
Tell me if this is right.

283
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:02,198
3321 Mason Street,
San Francisco...

284
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,359
<i>94105.</i>

285
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,063
<i>The phone number is 415... </i>

286
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:12,675
Hello?

287
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:14,404
Angie? Angie.

288
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:17,072
Libby? I-I've tried
to call you a thousand times.

289
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,083
- Is Matty okay? Where is he?
- He's fine.

290
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,880
Everything is fine.

291
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:24,921
What are you doing in San Francisco?
Put him on the phone.

292
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:28,322
- Hey, why are you acting this way?
- Because you disappeared...

293
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,724
and I haven't seen my son
in a month!

294
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:33,820
- I-I was just about to call you.
- Oh, bullshit!

295
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,423
How can you move
and not tell me, Angie?

296
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,730
We were coming
to see you next week.

297
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:41,362
Just put Matty on the phone.

298
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:48,935
Matty? It's Mommy.
Come say hi.

299
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,507
Come here.
Here.

300
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:57,486
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hello, sweetie pie.

301
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,614
How are you, Matty?

302
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,250
I think about you
all the time, honey.

303
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:05,386
I miss you so much.
Are you doing okay, kiddo?

304
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:07,430
I love you.

305
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:12,595
Listen, Matty. I know that
this has been really hard...

306
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,798
but Angie is gonna bring you up
to see me next week, okay?

307
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:17,966
<i>Yes, Mommy. </i>

308
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:21,136
- Daddy!
- Nick?

309
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,951
Nick?

310
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:47,195
He was in San Francisco
last night.

311
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:50,699
I have a phone number,
but it's already been disconnected.

312
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:53,895
No, I don't...
I don't have a forwarding address.

313
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,098
He's gone.
Well, don't you have investigators?

314
00:27:57,173 --> 00:28:01,132
Doesn't your company want to get
its $2 million back?

315
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:04,647
Why aren't you listening to me?
I am innocent.

316
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,648
Yeah, you are. Sure, you are.

317
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:11,086
Hurry up.

318
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:25,300
Put some elbow grease
behind that stirring.

319
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:27,427
Nobody wants to eat
any burnt tapioca.

320
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,734
Does it smell
like it's burning?

321
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:33,071
Oh, I swear you got
shit for brains, girl.

322
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:35,805
You're in prison.
Do you get that?

323
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:37,813
Nobody wants to listen
to anybody in prison...

324
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,815
so you can just forget about
reopening your case...

325
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:41,817
or a jailhouse appeal.

326
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:43,819
You got that?

327
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:47,482
They take years...
and they're 95% unsuccessful.

328
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:49,752
So, if you want my advice...

329
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:51,623
<i>- No.
- Well, you're gonna get it. </i>

330
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,755
- You do your time.
- So what are you now, a lawyer?

331
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:58,800
Once upon a time.

332
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,104
But they tend
to disbar murderers.

333
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:05,903
And here's your Christmas present.
You ready?

334
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:10,036
Pay attention, because this is
best goddamn advice you ever gonna get.

335
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:13,105
Ever hear of double jeopardy?
Fifth amendment to the constitution?

336
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:15,674
Huh? No?
Well, double jeopardy provides that...

337
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:19,620
"No person may be tried for
the same crime twice. " You got that?

338
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:23,420
Keep stirrin'. The state says
you already killed your husband.

339
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:25,961
They can't convict you
of it a second time.

340
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:27,963
That means that
when you leave here...

341
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:31,762
you track him down,
and when you find him you can kill him.

342
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:36,067
That's right. You can walk right
up to him in Times Square...

343
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:38,767
put a gun to his head
and pull the fuckin' trigger...

344
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:42,073
and there's nothin'
anybody can do about it.

345
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:46,945
Kinda makes you feel
warm and tingly all over, don't it?

346
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:51,579
That's right.
Keep stirrin'.

347
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:20,711
I gotta hand it to you, honey.
It's just sheer hate driving you on.

348
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,795
The only way you're gonna
look like that...

349
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:38,857
is if I staple the picture
to your forehead.

350
00:30:38,935 --> 00:30:41,096
Just trust me, okay?

351
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:50,473
<i>- Matty's eighth birthday, honey.
-  Aw. </i>

352
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,674
<i>- Oh...
- Look at that. </i>

353
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:19,074
You know, Evelyn,
I read that even if a child...

354
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:23,340
is separated from its mother
the day it's born...

355
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,847
it never forgets her voice.

356
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,850
Think that's true?

357
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:34,422
'Course I do.

358
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:41,524
I feel like I've grown
these past six years.

359
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,532
"Grown"?
Honey, they don't want to hear...

360
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,534
that you've turned into
some kind of tree, okay?

361
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:48,935
So just repeat after me: "If I could
trade places with my husband, I would. "

362
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:51,200
Ugh. "If I could trade places
with my husband, I would. "

363
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,208
That's good. Now throw in a lot
of that born-again-Jesus stuff.

364
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:55,141
- They like that.
- Listen, listen, listen.

365
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,145
I want you to start
with this...

366
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,613
"I'm not sitting in front of you today
to make excuses. "

367
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:03,618
<i>I'm not sitting in front of you today
to try to make any excuses. </i>

368
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:06,314
<i>I killed my husband. </i>

369
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:10,052
<i>I've had to live with that
every day for the past six years. </i>

370
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:12,686
<i>But I swear to you
that I'm a changed person. </i>

371
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:14,855
Why should we believe you?

372
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:18,230
I don't think I can
ask you to believe me.

373
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:21,759
All I can really do
is believe in myself...

374
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:26,468
and know that if I were given a chance,
I could do something good with my life.

375
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,340
Make up for the wrong I did.

376
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,896
That was cool. Oh, mom-my!

377
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:55,597
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey. Talk to me.

378
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,606
Oh, man,
did you see that?

379
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:07,312
<i>... six years
telling each other stories... </i>

380
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:09,851
<i>about all the shit
that's been done to you. </i>

381
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,423
<i>A lot of shit's been done to you.
I know that. </i>

382
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,320
<i>But let's imagine that all those people
that did that shit showed up here. </i>

383
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:19,225
- The man's across the hall.
- Thanks.

384
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:21,229
Let's imagine that they all
showed up here and apologized.

385
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:24,095
<i>Would that change the situation
you're in right now?</i>

386
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:31,139
<i>-  There's the windup...
- Come in.</i>

387
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,505
<i>Ball two. </i>

388
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:43,750
- I'm Elizabeth Parsons.
- What do you have in that box?

389
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,593
Elizabeth Parsons.

390
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:56,626
The state of Washington has granted you
a conditional parole.

391
00:33:56,699 --> 00:33:59,429
<i>For the next three years, you will
observe all the rules of this facility,</i>

392
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:02,903
which means no fighting, no fornicating,
no drinking, no drugs...

393
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:04,906
no exceptions, no excuses.

394
00:34:04,974 --> 00:34:07,807
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

395
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,811
This is your
social security card.

396
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:14,111
You will find gainful
and sustained employment.

397
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:16,083
<i>You are not to carry a firearm
or a weapon of any kind... </i>

398
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:18,347
especially a knife.

399
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:20,514
<i>Curfew is at 8:30.</i>

400
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,855
This is my cell phone number.
Do not lose it.

401
00:34:23,926 --> 00:34:26,190
<i>If you think there's a chance
you will be even five minutes late... </i>

402
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:27,661
you will call me,
I will have you picked up.

403
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,664
Do you understand that?
Good.

404
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:32,292
Any violation
of these conditions...

405
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:35,963
<i>and your "get out of jail free" card
will be revoked by me and you will... </i>

406
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:38,973
return to prison to serve the remainder
of your sentence and maybe then some.

407
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,441
Look right here.

408
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,549
- Is this a problem for you?
- No.

409
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:01,153
Yes, it is.
Do you want to tell me about him?

410
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,289
No.

411
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,800
No.

412
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:07,802
I'm gonna have trouble
with you, Parsons.

413
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,963
No, sir. No, you're not.
I learned my lesson. I just...

414
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,973
<i>I'm not interested
in your goddamn contrition. </i>

415
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,635
I'm interested in your behavior.
Get out of here and behave yourself.

416
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,076
You're in room eight
on the second floor.

417
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:48,843
No, you're, uh...

418
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:50,845
You're never gonna
get anywhere like that.

419
00:35:50,913 --> 00:35:53,746
Here.

420
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:00,155
Hmm. Nice shampoo.

421
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:03,350
- What are you looking for?
- A friend I haven't seen for years.

422
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:05,360
Someone said
I should try the Internet.

423
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:08,192
This a boy... friend?

424
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:11,461
- Girl.
- Well, in that case, I'll help you.

425
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:14,367
Does your friend have E-mail?

426
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:18,339
- I have no idea.
- Okay, come on. Let's do some surfing.

427
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:21,342
<i>- So, what's your friend's name?
- Angela Green.</i>

428
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,901
Uh, zip code?

429
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,414
Hmm. How about
a social security number?

430
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:29,042
That way we could run a credit report,
and it'll give us her address.

431
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:33,214
Nope.
She was a school teacher.

432
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:35,223
Done deal.

433
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:45,532
<i> And... voilà.</i>

434
00:36:47,336 --> 00:36:50,828
Now, maybe when this thing has finished
its searching, we could go to this...

435
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:54,569
this neat little bar I know and, uh,
you know, have a little drink.

436
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:57,938
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

437
00:36:58,014 --> 00:37:00,847
I just have to check in
with my parole officer first.

438
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,353
- You've been to jail?
- Actually, prison. Jail is different.

439
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:11,052
So, what did you do,
not pay your parking tickets?

440
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:15,086
Oh, no. I was convicted
of murdering my husband.

441
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,225
You're kidding, right?

442
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:23,465
No, I'm not. Um, "sliced and diced,"
the paper called it.

443
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:25,473
Can you believe that?

444
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,876
You're not kidding?

445
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:32,243
No. I said I wasn't.
But it would be nice to have a drink.

446
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:34,248
I haven't been out in a long time.

447
00:37:35,317 --> 00:37:37,251
Ye... Oh!

448
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:39,253
Oh, look,
I just remembered I have, um...

449
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:41,448
- this appointment with the...
- See ya.

450
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,116
See ya. Sorry.

451
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,724
<i>Oh. Book. See ya. </i>

452
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:56,062
Oh, my God.

453
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:03,110
He takes me out for dinner and feeds me
escargot. Do you know what those are?

454
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,773
- Yeah.
- Snails. Snails, yuck.

455
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,782
But anyway, the moment
I go to bed with him...

456
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,909
- the big asshole dumps me.
- Geez, man.

457
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:12,749
<i> Oh, for Christ's sake,
you nit-picking fuck!</i>

458
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:14,756
<i> Ruby, do not
insult me by raising your voice. </i>

459
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:16,792
<i>I'm standing right here,
and I can hear you just fine. </i>

460
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,851
<i>-  All right. Sorry.
- I don't like it when you call me names. </i>

461
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:22,022
<i>Please, Mr. Lehman, don't do this to me.
I didn't do nothing!</i>

462
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:24,931
<i>- Where were you this afternoon?
- I was at my job. </i>

463
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,197
You were on Pike Street wearing
lime hot pants and fishnet stockings!

464
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,296
- I was on my way to work!
- At McDonald's? In those clothes?

465
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:33,466
You haven't been to work in a week!
Get your stuff.

466
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,705
<i>Look, I-I'm sorry, man.
I won't do it again. </i>

467
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:38,713
I will never do that shit again.
I promise that.

468
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,840
You blew off your parole.
You're going back. It's that simple.

469
00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:46,354
You fuck.
You fuckin' cocksucker!

470
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:49,050
<i>- You got a dirty mouth, Ruby!
- I want one chance!</i>

471
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,355
<i>I just want one chance!</i>

472
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:53,827
Goddamn you, motherfucker!

473
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:56,023
You son of a bitch.
You mean fucker.

474
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:59,226
You send me back there it'll kill me,
you mean son of a bitch!

475
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:01,929
<i>-  Come on.
- Fuck you! Fucking asshole!</i>

476
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:05,235
Show's over. Go to sleep!

477
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,515
You think
I'm a mean son of a bitch?

478
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,381
I think you could have
given her a second chance.

479
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,944
There are no second chances in this
house. This is the last chance house.

480
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:23,014
<i>- You try to understand that.
-  Yeah. Yeah, we got it. </i>

481
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:25,287
What the hell is wrong
with that guy?

482
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,626
What I heard, the man used to be
some college whatchamacallit.

483
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,097
- Law teacher or something?
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.

484
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:35,160
You're kidding. How does a law professor
end up someplace like this?

485
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,262
- 'Cause life's a bitch.
- Bitch, my ass.

486
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:39,830
He got a D.U.I.
And totaled his car.

487
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:42,400
I heard he totaled his wife
and his daughter in that accident.

488
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:44,776
Girl, you're talkin' shit.
Nobody got killed.

489
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:47,714
But by the time his wife got done
with him, I bet he wished he was dead.

490
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:50,650
Took everything he had.
Including the kid.

491
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,880
Hasn't seen his girl in years.

492
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:40,725
<i>Libby, it's wrong of you
to be here. It's very wrong. </i>

493
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:43,772
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you're my only hope.

494
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,569
Sharon? No, you put
that down, please.

495
00:40:46,642 --> 00:40:48,576
Libby, I'm sorry.
I can't.

496
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:51,204
I want to find my son!

497
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,214
Matty's had
six years with Angie.

498
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,978
I mean, think about it,
Libby... six years.

499
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:58,986
Oh, Benjamin,
that's a great sand castle.

500
00:40:59,054 --> 00:41:01,147
If you come back
into his life right now...

501
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:04,021
it's just gonna cause
more disruption and pain.

502
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:07,790
Just think about it, Libby, please?
Think about it.

503
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:11,026
I just want to see him, Rebecca.

504
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,591
Can you give me an address
for Angie, so I can see him?

505
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:17,230
Look, I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.

506
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,644
<i>Lauren? Come on, get down, please.
That's it. </i>

507
00:42:07,423 --> 00:42:11,826
- Where's Parsons?
- I don't know. Not here.

508
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:50,730
<i>Probably just a raccoon. </i>

509
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,326
<i>Check up the stairs. </i>

510
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:48,649
Cutter! Up here!

511
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:55,997
Shit!

512
00:43:58,033 --> 00:43:59,796
I got her.

513
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,158
There she is.

514
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:02,990
Shit!

515
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,280
Ohh!

516
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:35,693
Jesus Christ, Libby,
what are you doing here?

517
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,063
Did you have a nice day
at the beach?

518
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:23,277
You piss me off, Parsons.

519
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:32,013
Angela Green... that's the woman
that's got your kid, right?

520
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:35,284
Can we not talk, please, Lehman?

521
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,291
Okay.
All right.

522
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,793
- So why'd she skip town?
- She just skipped town.

523
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:41,796
Yeah, with your husband,
who isn't dead...

524
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:43,798
'cause you didn't kill him?

525
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,800
- Bullshit.
- Okay, I killed my husband.

526
00:46:45,868 --> 00:46:48,496
I chopped him up into little bits,
and dumped him in the Pacific.

527
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,504
- Are you satisfied?
- No. No.

528
00:46:50,572 --> 00:46:53,803
You were a hell of a lot closer to your
kid three days ago than you are today.

529
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:57,471
All you had to do was wait three years.
That's all.

530
00:46:57,546 --> 00:47:00,310
You fucking idiot.

531
00:47:02,885 --> 00:47:05,319
You cannot know what it is like
to sit in prison for six years...

532
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,322
and think of nothing else
in the world but your son.

533
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,324
Did I make the right choice?
You ask the wrong question, Lehman.

534
00:47:10,392 --> 00:47:12,326
I didn't have a choice.
Fuck your curfew!

535
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:24,838
<i>Who's that? Your daughter?</i>

536
00:47:28,243 --> 00:47:30,541
Is that a problem
for you, Lehman?

537
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:34,651
I'm going up top.

538
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:50,265
Don't go anywhere.

539
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,776
<i>Janey, honey, read your book. </i>

540
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:49,223
Oh! Shit!

541
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:22,479
Oh, my God!

542
00:52:06,355 --> 00:52:08,687
- I got him!
- Grab ahold for me.

543
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:18,899
<i>O-2 ready. </i>

544
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:21,937
<i>-  Is he all right?
- I guess he's all right.</i>

545
00:52:39,088 --> 00:52:40,953
<i>Did you voluntarily give her the gun?</i>

546
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:42,925
Come on, Karl. What do you think?
Hey! Hey.

547
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:44,855
- Sorry.
- Were you drinking?

548
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,589
- No, I wasn't drinking.
- It's been known to happen.

549
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:50,063
- Do you have any idea where she's gone?
- No.

550
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:52,066
All right.
Well, that's about all, then, isn't it?

551
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:53,965
All what?

552
00:52:54,036 --> 00:52:55,970
<i>There'll be an investigation
into your actions today. </i>

553
00:52:56,038 --> 00:52:59,007
I wouldn't hold my breath about
the prospect of keeping your job.

554
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:01,907
Karl, give me a break.
Goddamn.

555
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:05,212
Thanks a lot.

556
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,554
<i>Sent your father off to the V.F.W.</i>

557
00:53:20,629 --> 00:53:23,063
<i>He'll be playing gin for hours. </i>

558
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:25,725
- Some things never change.
- Oh!

559
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,235
He's not as bad
as he used to be, you know.

560
00:53:28,303 --> 00:53:30,237
I'm glad for you, Mama.

561
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:45,551
I always said
there was good money in tomatoes.

562
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,773
<i>So. You're in the market
for a B.M.W?</i>

563
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:17,216
- Yeah. Who isn't?
- Well, they're the best.

564
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:19,719
I decided it was finally
time to trade up.

565
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:21,722
Right.

566
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,384
So why don't you check my credit
and see if I can finance this.

567
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:26,427
Great. Let me have
your social security number...

568
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:28,429
and I'll get the ball rolling.

569
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:41,408
Twenty Oriole Terrace,
Evergreen, Colorado.

570
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:43,410
Is that your current address?

571
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:46,743
Twenty Oriole Terrace,
Evergreen, Colorado? Sure is.

572
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:50,342
Didn't you say your name was
Angela Green? 'Cause this says Ryder.

573
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:54,617
- Oh, no. I said Ryder. Angela Ryder.
- What about the car?

574
00:54:56,618 --> 00:54:59,712
Here. Fill this out
and come back to me.

575
00:54:59,788 --> 00:55:04,225
- How's tricks, Orbe?
- No way.

576
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:06,817
No way, no way.
I've been clean, Mr. Travis.

577
00:55:06,895 --> 00:55:09,056
Oh, I know.
I believe you. I do.

578
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:11,156
What I need is a search
on a lady named Angela Green.

579
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:13,827
I've got her social security
number here. I'd like you to...

580
00:55:13,902 --> 00:55:16,234
Please. You know I'm not allowed
to give out personal information.

581
00:55:16,304 --> 00:55:18,238
Oh, I'm so... I shouldn't have
asked you that. I'm sorry.

582
00:55:18,306 --> 00:55:20,331
Uh-huh.

583
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:22,343
Speaking of giving out personal
information, does your employer know...

584
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:24,345
you used to perform
the art of fellatio for a living...

585
00:55:24,413 --> 00:55:26,677
- went to prison, and you're on parole?
- Okay. Okay. Shut up.

586
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:28,943
- You're required by law to tell him.
- All right. Okay.

587
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,948
You're looking good, Orbe.

588
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:36,957
I know.

589
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:23,889
<i>Honey, can you get that?</i>

590
00:57:29,137 --> 00:57:31,298
Hi.

591
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:40,941
<i>-  Who is it, Sam?
- Uh, some lady. </i>

592
00:57:42,217 --> 00:57:43,707
May I help you?

593
00:57:43,785 --> 00:57:46,413
I'm looking for
my friend, Angela Ryder.

594
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:50,254
- I thought this was her address.
- I've never heard of her.

595
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:53,590
But we've just moved in. Maybe you
should check with the woman next door.

596
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:55,789
<i>She's been here 40 years. </i>

597
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:57,354
<i>Excuse me. </i>

598
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:01,493
Dearie, whatever you're selling,
I've already got two of them.

599
00:58:03,338 --> 00:58:05,431
I'm just looking
for my friend, Angela Ryder.

600
00:58:05,507 --> 00:58:08,101
<i>She used to live next door. </i>

601
00:58:08,176 --> 00:58:12,112
Oh, I... I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you.

602
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,910
But Angie died
in the accident.

603
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:19,484
<i>I- It was three
or four years ago. </i>

604
00:58:19,554 --> 00:58:21,488
It was one of those
awful things. The...

605
00:58:21,556 --> 00:58:25,117
The, uh, stove, the gas stove
in their house was leaking.

606
00:58:25,193 --> 00:58:27,889
<i>The explosion knocked out
some of my windows... </i>

607
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,454
<i>- and, uh...
- What about the boy?</i>

608
00:58:30,532 --> 00:58:33,023
Matty?
He's such a dear child.

609
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:35,865
No, he and Simon weren't there
when it happened.

610
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,330
<i>Poor Simon. </i>

611
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:43,207
I've never seen anyone so...
grief stricken.

612
00:58:43,278 --> 00:58:45,872
Oh, I'm sure.

613
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,374
Help me out, kiddo.

614
00:59:20,582 --> 00:59:23,210
It would really help
if you could remember...

615
00:59:23,285 --> 00:59:25,219
what kind of car
she was driving.

616
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:28,051
<i>- Well, it was an old truck.
- Yeah?</i>

617
00:59:28,123 --> 00:59:30,557
It's, um... I don't know
what year or make or anything.

618
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,752
<i>Well, what color was it?</i>

619
00:59:59,154 --> 01:00:02,749
<i>Kandinsky? It's a bit out
of our reach, I'm afraid. </i>

620
01:00:02,824 --> 01:00:05,884
I have a few Picasso
and Chagall lithographs.

621
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,894
Mm, no.
It-It's Kandinsky...

622
01:00:07,962 --> 01:00:10,760
<i>that I'm particularly interested in,
especially his Blue Rider period. </i>

623
01:00:10,832 --> 01:00:14,700
- I love that.
- Uh, well, uh...

624
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:17,005
Let's check Art Scan.

625
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,205
Kandinskys don't become available
too often, I'm afraid.

626
01:00:23,611 --> 01:00:25,545
<i>Here's a lovely little Miro. </i>

627
01:00:25,613 --> 01:00:28,707
- It's quite reasonable.
- It really needs to be Kandinsky.

628
01:00:28,783 --> 01:00:31,149
Kandinsky... yes.

629
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,550
<i>Ah! Here is a lovely
1922 Kandinsky lithograph. </i>

630
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:39,491
- It's not quite the...
- The 1911 is all that interests me.

631
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,494
1911...

632
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:55,441
Stop. There. Yes.
Yes, that's it.

633
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:58,445
We've missed that. It was sold to
a museum in Munich six months ago.

634
01:00:58,513 --> 01:01:01,505
Do you think you could find who sold it?
Perhaps they have more.

635
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:05,308
Well, uh, why, yes.
Yes, let's see.

636
01:01:10,591 --> 01:01:13,082
<i>If you'll excuse me a moment. </i>

637
01:01:18,766 --> 01:01:21,132
<i>Yes, sir.
Can I help you?</i>

638
01:01:21,202 --> 01:01:23,500
Yes. My name
is Travis Lehman.

639
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:42,382
<i> Actually, I'm looking
for a young lady. </i>

640
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:54,090
She seemed so refined.

641
01:02:54,162 --> 01:02:57,723
I would really like to know
what that woman wanted in your gallery.

642
01:04:20,748 --> 01:04:23,114
Can I help you?

643
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:27,520
I'm looking
for Jonathan Devereaux.

644
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:31,388
Mr. Devereaux is out right now.
He'll be back tonight for the party.

645
01:04:31,459 --> 01:04:35,953
- Well, is Matty here?
- I don't believe I know you, ma'am.

646
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,692
Maybe you'd like
to leave a message.

647
01:05:01,122 --> 01:05:03,056
<i> It's certainly a pleasure
having you stay with us... </i>

648
01:05:03,124 --> 01:05:05,422
<i>- here at the Monteleone, Mrs. Kritch.
-  Thank you. </i>

649
01:05:05,493 --> 01:05:09,054
<i>- My suite has a view?
- Your room has a lovely view. </i>

650
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:11,724
<i>- And I need a masseuse.
- I'll send Jerome right up. </i>

651
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:13,733
<i>Bruce?</i>

652
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:16,736
<i>Fourteen twenty...
Mrs. Kritch. </i>

653
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:20,239
<i>Hello. </i>

654
01:05:34,088 --> 01:05:36,579
I'm sorry.
Are you... lost?

655
01:05:36,657 --> 01:05:40,889
No. Actually, I'm found.
I just had an hour with Jerome.

656
01:05:42,263 --> 01:05:45,027
Oh. Jerome.
I've heard that he is marvelous.

657
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:48,967
<i>He's fabulous.  I haven't felt
this good since my husband died.</i>

658
01:05:49,036 --> 01:05:53,029
So, I've got something for tonight,
but I think I need Armani.

659
01:05:54,275 --> 01:05:56,539
Yes. Very good, Mrs...

660
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,635
Kritch. Suite 1420.

661
01:05:58,713 --> 01:06:00,874
Of course.

662
01:06:00,948 --> 01:06:03,143
I'll be charging it
to my room.

663
01:06:09,223 --> 01:06:12,886
<i>Hmm. Now, Mrs. Kritch... </i>

664
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,396
I would say that you
are a size... four?

665
01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:19,058
- A two.
- Of course.

666
01:06:30,143 --> 01:06:32,236
<i>There's a guy waiting for you. </i>

667
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:45,014
Did you catch that thing?

668
01:06:45,092 --> 01:06:47,083
What did you use for bait?

669
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,924
I caught that
big bucket-mouth son of a bitch...

670
01:06:49,997 --> 01:06:53,091
off an old rebel lure
my daddy left me.

671
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:55,100
'Course there's buzz bombs,
poppers, jigs...

672
01:06:55,168 --> 01:06:58,160
all kinds of things work
back in these waters.

673
01:06:58,238 --> 01:06:59,705
I'm Jim Mangold.

674
01:06:59,773 --> 01:07:02,674
Travis Lehman, Washington
Department of Corrections.

675
01:07:02,743 --> 01:07:04,677
What can I do for you?

676
01:07:05,913 --> 01:07:08,711
- Who's this?
- That's somebody I'm looking for.

677
01:07:08,782 --> 01:07:10,773
<i>- Pretty girl.
- Oh, yeah. </i>

678
01:07:10,851 --> 01:07:13,684
She's very pretty,
for a convicted murderer.

679
01:07:14,688 --> 01:07:18,055
She jumped parole on me.

680
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,556
Mr. Lehman, I'd love
to be able to help you, sir.

681
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:24,324
No, I don't want you guys to go
to any trouble. I can handle matters.

682
01:07:24,398 --> 01:07:26,366
<i>I just came down
as a professional courtesy... </i>

683
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:27,923
since she's in New Orleans...

684
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:30,299
and came here to kill one
of your prominent citizens.

685
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,828
- How is she planning on doing that?
- I don't know.

686
01:07:33,907 --> 01:07:37,343
She'll probably use
the. 38 special she stole from me.

687
01:07:40,247 --> 01:07:42,374
Roy Lee!

688
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:44,917
Get these in the works...
now.

689
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,254
- She looks lovely.
- Invitation, please.

690
01:07:49,323 --> 01:07:51,257
Enjoy your evening.

691
01:07:51,325 --> 01:07:53,850
Good evening.
Thank you.

692
01:07:56,163 --> 01:07:59,758
<i>Invitations, please.
Yes, I need to see your invitation. </i>

693
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:05,271
Enjoy your evening.

694
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:07,398
Your invitation?

695
01:08:10,844 --> 01:08:13,108
<i>- Good evening.
- What a remarkable wrap.</i>

696
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,045
Where on earth
did you find that?

697
01:08:15,115 --> 01:08:17,879
The first lady asked me the same thing
when we stayed at the White House...

698
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,044
and I wouldn't
tell her either.

699
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,054
<i>- Your invitation, sir?
- I got it right here.</i>

700
01:08:22,122 --> 01:08:24,716
<i>- Enjoy your evening. Good evening, miss.
- Good evening.</i>

701
01:09:25,685 --> 01:09:28,552
<i>- Good evening, mesdames and messieurs.
- Good evening!</i>

702
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,647
We're delighted to have you
with us this evening...

703
01:09:30,724 --> 01:09:35,525
<i>on this very special occasion. As is the
custom in New Orleans, since before... </i>

704
01:09:35,595 --> 01:09:40,032
the War of Northern Aggression...

705
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,398
We offer the ladies of this fair city
our first bachelor...

706
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:46,906
to be put up on the auction block,
our host, Jonathan Devereaux.

707
01:09:51,278 --> 01:09:54,304
<i>Where is that man?
Where is that man?</i>

708
01:09:55,282 --> 01:09:57,216
<i>- Hey, Jonathan.
- Thank you, Louis.</i>

709
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:00,185
You all having a good time?

710
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:04,747
<i>Now then, ladies,
what you see before you... </i>

711
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:07,089
is a moderately presentable
man in his 30s...

712
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:11,153
given to unhealthy thoughts
and a dissipated lifestyle...

713
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:15,297
With... and this is what's gonna
cost you the really big money...

714
01:10:20,407 --> 01:10:22,875
Absolutely no
redeeming moral virtue.

715
01:10:26,113 --> 01:10:29,844
- Five hundred.
- Dear woman, my cuff links cost more.

716
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:32,476
<i>Do I hear a thousand?</i>

717
01:10:32,552 --> 01:10:34,679
- A thousand.
- Thank you.

718
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:40,188
- Mmm!
- Two thousand.

719
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,194
<i>All right, now, did I just hear
the voice of the charming Miss Monroe?</i>

720
01:10:44,264 --> 01:10:47,233
<i>'Cause I was just starting to worry...
beginning to think you didn't care. </i>

721
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,996
<i>Twenty-five hundred. </i>

722
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:56,400
Twenty-five hundred.
We have a new bidder.

723
01:10:56,476 --> 01:10:59,036
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Three thousand.

724
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:03,080
- Five thousand.
- Oh!

725
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,022
Fifty-five hundred.

726
01:11:17,264 --> 01:11:20,597
We have fifty-five hundred.
Will, uh...

727
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,601
Will the lady take us to six?

728
01:11:24,771 --> 01:11:28,263
Ten thousand dollars.

729
01:11:32,012 --> 01:11:35,812
<i>Well, see, at last,
someone who knows my true value. </i>

730
01:11:35,882 --> 01:11:38,715
<i>Now, Miss Monroe,
I believe the bid... </i>

731
01:11:38,785 --> 01:11:41,811
is to you at $10,500.

732
01:11:41,888 --> 01:11:43,879
Well, you can have him, honey.

733
01:11:43,957 --> 01:11:45,891
Believe me,
he ain't worth that much...

734
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:47,927
I know from personal experience.

735
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:50,292
Yeah. Thank you, honey.

736
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:52,797
<i>All right, going once. </i>

737
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:54,800
Going twice.

738
01:11:56,069 --> 01:11:59,232
Sold to the woman
in the back.

739
01:11:59,306 --> 01:12:01,240
Ten thousand dollars.

740
01:12:04,978 --> 01:12:07,640
Would you like to come forward
and claim your prize, young lady?

741
01:12:14,854 --> 01:12:17,254
Hello, Nick.

742
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:25,864
Well, aren't you
gonna give me a kiss?

743
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:30,469
I think I've earned it.

744
01:12:44,451 --> 01:12:47,887
<i>- And now...
- I'll make this real easy for you, Nick.</i>

745
01:12:47,954 --> 01:12:50,548
I'll make you an offer
you can't refuse.

746
01:12:50,624 --> 01:12:53,058
You used to love a good deal,
didn't you?

747
01:12:53,126 --> 01:12:55,390
- Can we take this someplace private?
- I don't think so.

748
01:12:55,462 --> 01:12:57,726
I remember what happened
the last time we were alone.

749
01:12:57,797 --> 01:13:00,231
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Suzanne Monroe.

750
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,860
I'm Libby.
I'm his wife.

751
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:06,029
Well, Jonathan!

752
01:13:06,106 --> 01:13:09,473
<i>A minute ago a bachelor,
and now you're married. </i>

753
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:12,409
You don't waste any time.

754
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:14,413
- You been in New Orleans long?
- She's, uh...

755
01:13:14,481 --> 01:13:16,415
I'm just passing through town
to pick up my child.

756
01:13:16,483 --> 01:13:18,417
- I'll be leaving very soon.
- How nice.

757
01:13:18,485 --> 01:13:20,385
<i>We're finally putting the past
behind us and moving on... </i>

758
01:13:20,453 --> 01:13:23,980
- with our lives, aren't we, Jonathan?
- Sure.

759
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:25,991
I do have
one question, though.

760
01:13:26,059 --> 01:13:28,823
How long were Angie and you fucking
before you decided to get rid of me?

761
01:13:32,766 --> 01:13:35,669
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.

762
01:13:38,104 --> 01:13:40,038
- Where is he, Nick?
- Libby. Libby...

763
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:42,040
You destroyed my life,
and I will destroy yours...

764
01:13:42,108 --> 01:13:44,042
unless you give me Matty.

765
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:47,045
- That's all I want.
- Let me explain something to you.

766
01:13:47,113 --> 01:13:49,104
You have to understand something.
We were going under.

767
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:51,548
We were gonna lose everything.

768
01:13:51,618 --> 01:13:54,519
If I'd had any guts,
I would have killed myself...

769
01:13:54,587 --> 01:13:56,521
but I was trying
to protect you.

770
01:13:56,589 --> 01:13:59,683
That's why I got the life insurance...
I would be out of the picture...

771
01:13:59,759 --> 01:14:02,387
and you and Matty
would be okay.

772
01:14:02,462 --> 01:14:05,522
And I-I just never believed
they would convict you.

773
01:14:06,966 --> 01:14:09,560
They did, Nick.

774
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:12,764
And the thing with Angie
happened later.

775
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:16,002
It was just...
It was a nightmare.

776
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:18,408
And the worst part of it
was being away from you.

777
01:14:18,478 --> 01:14:21,106
So is that why
you killed her?

778
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:26,882
- That was an accident.
- Nice try, Nick. I'm not buying.

779
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:29,786
<i>- It's bullshit.
- I will swear on the life of our son.</i>

780
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:33,223
Oh, don't you fucking dare.

781
01:14:33,293 --> 01:14:36,694
You can keep your hotel,
your fancy accent and your new name.

782
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,254
- Just give me Matty.
- I understand.

783
01:14:39,332 --> 01:14:41,766
No. Now.
Give him to me now.

784
01:14:41,835 --> 01:14:43,769
Libby, it's the middle of the night.
I can't just walk away.

785
01:14:43,837 --> 01:14:45,634
<i>- Do you think I'm stupid?
- No, I don't think you're stupid.</i>

786
01:14:45,705 --> 01:14:48,936
- I won't let you slip away once again.
- It's too far to Matty's school.

787
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:53,035
- You've got to be patient.
- I've been patient for six years.

788
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,775
<i>-  Do I hear 2,000?
- I want my child.</i>

789
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:58,841
Ah! Thank you.
You're a beautiful woman.

790
01:14:58,918 --> 01:15:02,581
I'll call you tomorrow, Nick.
No screwing around.

791
01:15:02,655 --> 01:15:05,419
<i>Going twice.
Okay, 2,000 for the lady in red. </i>

792
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:09,053
Excuse me. Do you know
where Mr. Devereaux is?

793
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:11,063
- He's at the bar, sir.
- Over here?

794
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:13,065
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

795
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:17,001
<i>You ready to spend some more money?
Who's gonna start us off?</i>

796
01:15:22,742 --> 01:15:25,210
I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you, Marcel.

797
01:15:25,278 --> 01:15:27,212
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Oh, no thanks.

798
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,214
Wait a second.
Let me guess.

799
01:15:29,282 --> 01:15:31,512
I take you
for scotch and soda.

800
01:15:31,584 --> 01:15:34,178
Well, I'll have
a Diet Coke, please.

801
01:15:34,254 --> 01:15:37,018
Well, all right, but I bet you used
to drink and now you're on the wagon.

802
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:40,025
- Ten dollars says I'm right.
- You've never seen this woman before?

803
01:15:40,093 --> 01:15:42,027
- No, I'm positive.
- Okay.

804
01:15:42,095 --> 01:15:44,359
Let me get it straight.
She believes that I am her husband...

805
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,364
- Oh, yeah.
- Whom she killed.

806
01:15:46,432 --> 01:15:48,366
Yes, sir.

807
01:15:49,435 --> 01:15:51,369
That's-That's pretty far-fetched.

808
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:53,371
Far-fetched or not,
she is in New Orleans...

809
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:55,703
she does have a gun
and she is looking for you.

810
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,142
- Thank you. I'll alert our security.
- You do that.

811
01:16:15,795 --> 01:16:18,059
Cops have been
passing these out.

812
01:16:22,168 --> 01:16:24,898
No reward. Screw 'em.

813
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,432
You're gonna be posted
in every hotel in town.

814
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:33,673
So much for a good night's sleep.

815
01:16:40,486 --> 01:16:44,115
Take this.
Get out of here.

816
01:16:47,961 --> 01:16:49,895
Thanks a lot.

817
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:28,559
Let's go, Lehman.
We spotted your girl.

818
01:18:01,534 --> 01:18:03,468
Where'd she go, Dilbert?

819
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,344
Hey!

820
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:26,315
Hey!

821
01:18:31,364 --> 01:18:33,298
Hey!

822
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:59,824
Hey!

823
01:19:01,828 --> 01:19:04,820
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

824
01:19:04,897 --> 01:19:06,831
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm very sorry, ma'am.

825
01:19:06,899 --> 01:19:09,868
I thought you were somebody else.
It was a case of mistaken identity.

826
01:19:09,936 --> 01:19:13,531
- Have a good evening.
- I take it that ain't her.

827
01:19:27,785 --> 01:19:30,015
<i> Mr. Lehman. </i>

828
01:19:30,088 --> 01:19:31,680
Come in.

829
01:19:31,756 --> 01:19:34,224
<i>- Thank you.
- May I offer you a Cuban cigar?</i>

830
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:36,556
Oh, no thanks.

831
01:19:36,628 --> 01:19:40,860
As you can see,
I'm alive and kicking.

832
01:19:40,932 --> 01:19:42,524
Yeah.

833
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:45,635
So what can I do for you
this morning?

834
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:48,536
We spotted the Parsons woman
in the Quarter last night.

835
01:19:48,606 --> 01:19:53,066
<i>She got away. I just came by
to find out if you'd heard from her. </i>

836
01:19:53,144 --> 01:19:56,113
<i>- Not a peep.
- Do you have any idea... </i>

837
01:19:56,181 --> 01:19:59,241
why she's fixated
her lunacy on you?

838
01:19:59,317 --> 01:20:01,308
Well, the world's
full of crazy people, am I right?

839
01:20:01,386 --> 01:20:03,411
Oh, yes, you are right.

840
01:20:03,488 --> 01:20:06,389
<i>Truer words
were never spoken. </i>

841
01:20:07,492 --> 01:20:10,586
Those are nice pictures there.

842
01:20:10,662 --> 01:20:12,755
Did your kids do them?

843
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:16,698
Uh, no.

844
01:20:16,768 --> 01:20:20,226
Those pictures are by
a very great artist named Kandinsky.

845
01:20:20,305 --> 01:20:23,706
- Oh.
- Why do I think you already knew that?

846
01:20:26,778 --> 01:20:30,270
Excuse me for a second.

847
01:20:31,382 --> 01:20:34,180
Yes?

848
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:40,087
- This is a business call.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

849
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:42,251
I hope you'll excuse me.
You let yourself out that back door.

850
01:20:42,327 --> 01:20:45,819
<i>It leads to the kitchen. Get the chef
to fix you a New Orleans breakfast. </i>

851
01:20:45,897 --> 01:20:47,831
<i>- Thanks.
- I recommend the Eggs St. Jacques. </i>

852
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:50,060
<i>- Oh, boy. That sounds good.
- Mm-hmm. I have your card. </i>

853
01:20:50,134 --> 01:20:52,762
Okay.

854
01:20:55,306 --> 01:20:58,036
Morning, darlin'.
I hope you had a nice night.

855
01:20:58,109 --> 01:21:02,546
I want you to bring Matty
to Lafayette Cemetery number three.

856
01:21:02,614 --> 01:21:05,549
A cemetery?
That's an odd choice for a reunion.

857
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:09,178
It's a big tourist place, Nick.
Lot of people around.

858
01:21:09,254 --> 01:21:13,020
You're a smart girl.
I can have him there by 4:00.

859
01:21:53,431 --> 01:21:57,765
- Where's Matty?
- Relax. He's... He was nervous.

860
01:21:57,835 --> 01:22:00,702
So I just told him
he could go play inside.

861
01:22:08,313 --> 01:22:10,907
There he is.

862
01:22:10,982 --> 01:22:13,246
Matty?
Come over here, son.

863
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:16,879
<i>Oh, geez. Matty... </i>

864
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:19,184
- Okay, I'll get him for you.
- No! No.

865
01:22:20,258 --> 01:22:22,192
That's something
I want to do.

866
01:22:26,197 --> 01:22:27,926
<i>Matty?</i>

867
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:35,567
Matty?

868
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,938
<i>Hey, kiddo. </i>

869
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:43,039
<i>Hey, Matty!</i>

870
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,162
<i>Matty?</i>

871
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,174
M- Matty, it's Mommy.

872
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:09,366
<i> Mr. Lehman, you're gonna
have to learn to relax, son. </i>

873
01:24:09,434 --> 01:24:12,961
What have you got your panties
in such a twist about, anyhow?

874
01:24:14,572 --> 01:24:16,506
You ever arrest anybody...

875
01:24:16,574 --> 01:24:20,169
<i>- you thought was innocent, Mangold?
- Nope. </i>

876
01:24:24,282 --> 01:24:27,513
'Course there's no information
on Jonathan Devereaux...

877
01:24:27,585 --> 01:24:29,519
that's over three years old.

878
01:24:29,587 --> 01:24:32,681
- Three years ago the guy didn't exist.
- So he changed his name.

879
01:24:32,757 --> 01:24:34,691
Lots of folks
change their names, Lehman.

880
01:24:34,759 --> 01:24:36,693
- That don't make 'em criminals.
- Yeah, but I'm betting...

881
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:39,195
he changed it from Simon Ryder,
and before that, Nick Parsons.

882
01:24:39,263 --> 01:24:42,255
- But you can't prove it.
- No.

883
01:25:10,428 --> 01:25:12,760
<i>Hey! Is that long distance?</i>

884
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,991
Bill me.

885
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:17,500
Lucy, hi.
This is Travis. Listen.

886
01:25:17,568 --> 01:25:20,628
I want you to get the D.M.V. To fax
me a Washington driver's license...

887
01:25:20,705 --> 01:25:22,696
photograph of one
Nicholas Parsons.

888
01:25:22,773 --> 01:25:24,707
I'm at the New Orleans
Police Department.

889
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:26,709
<i>- You better talk to Mr. Carruthers.
- Travis!</i>

890
01:25:26,777 --> 01:25:30,679
<i>- His colon is twisted in a knot.
- Give me that.</i>

891
01:25:30,748 --> 01:25:32,978
I've had to cover
your office for you, Travis.

892
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:35,041
- Where the hell are you?
- Listen to me, Karl.

893
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:37,053
I think maybe this Parsons woman
has been telling the truth.

894
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:39,055
You're not a law professor
anymore, Travis.

895
01:25:39,123 --> 01:25:41,057
You're barely even
a parole officer.

896
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:44,322
<i>- So stop playing Mission Impossible...
- All I need...</i>

897
01:25:44,395 --> 01:25:47,031
is a D.M.V. Driver's license photograph
of Nicholas Parsons.

898
01:25:47,164 --> 01:25:49,189
You get back here today...

899
01:25:49,266 --> 01:25:51,757
because tomorrow, you're going
in front of the Commission.

900
01:25:51,835 --> 01:25:55,202
Karl, I know I'm right.

901
01:25:55,272 --> 01:25:57,536
You give me a chance, okay?

902
01:25:57,608 --> 01:25:59,542
Now, I'm asking you politely.

903
01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:02,044
You send me
the goddamn picture!

904
01:28:30,027 --> 01:28:31,961
Hey!

905
01:28:32,029 --> 01:28:34,998
<i> Hey!</i>

906
01:28:51,448 --> 01:28:53,109
It's not him.

907
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:55,481
<i>See, Lehman, the thing is,
every now and again... </i>

908
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,486
we all want to believe
in something...

909
01:28:57,554 --> 01:29:00,489
but we just keep forgetting
that 99.9 percent of the time...

910
01:29:00,557 --> 01:29:02,923
<i>life just flat don't work out. </i>

911
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:04,927
I hadn't thought
of that, Mangold.

912
01:29:04,995 --> 01:29:08,328
- Thanks. I feel a lot better now.
- Any time, Hoss. Any time.

913
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:21,537
Hold it.
Hold it right here.

914
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,566
It's over, Libby.

915
01:29:51,641 --> 01:29:54,735
Oh, Travis.

916
01:30:22,772 --> 01:30:24,706
Messages.

917
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:28,376
Thank you.

918
01:30:28,445 --> 01:30:31,539
<i>- Mr. Devereaux?
- Mr. Lehman.</i>

919
01:30:31,615 --> 01:30:33,708
<i>I'm sorry.
This is really not a good time. </i>

920
01:30:33,783 --> 01:30:35,717
I understand.

921
01:30:35,785 --> 01:30:38,219
A lot of people feel that way about me.
But I have good news.

922
01:30:38,288 --> 01:30:42,850
- Mm-hmm?
- Won't take long.

923
01:30:46,296 --> 01:30:49,561
- Well?
- Well...

924
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:52,727
turns out I owe you
an apology, Mr. Devereaux.

925
01:30:54,304 --> 01:30:56,738
After our last conversation
I started thinking...

926
01:30:56,806 --> 01:31:00,242
maybe that Parsons woman is telling
the truth about who you used to be.

927
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:04,747
So I asked the Washington
State Department of Motor Vehicles...

928
01:31:04,814 --> 01:31:09,649
to send me a driver's license
photograph of Nicholas Parsons.

929
01:31:10,987 --> 01:31:13,751
- And?
- And this is what came up.

930
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,234
Well...

931
01:31:26,937 --> 01:31:29,201
We all make mistakes.
There's no harm done.

932
01:31:29,272 --> 01:31:32,264
<i>Then I thought about it some more, and
it occurred to me what a common name... </i>

933
01:31:32,342 --> 01:31:34,276
Nicholas Parsons is.

934
01:31:34,344 --> 01:31:36,608
You know, it turns out
there were six.

935
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,614
<i>And this... </i>

936
01:31:38,682 --> 01:31:41,242
<i>was number three. </i>

937
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,418
I never liked that picture.

938
01:31:49,459 --> 01:31:52,223
So, Mr. Lehman,
you came here to make a deal...

939
01:31:52,295 --> 01:31:54,559
otherwise, I guess you would have
gone straight to the police.

940
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:58,226
- So, question is, what's your price?
- A million dollars.

941
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:02,563
It's a nice round figure, right?

942
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,573
Uh...

943
01:32:07,143 --> 01:32:10,237
All right. But you're gonna have to
give me a couple of days.

944
01:32:10,313 --> 01:32:13,248
No way.
One million dollars, right now.

945
01:32:13,316 --> 01:32:17,013
Mr. Lehman, it's 9:00 at night.
I can't just...

946
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:23,822
<i>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait. </i>

947
01:32:24,928 --> 01:32:27,658
I have $100,000
in the safe here.

948
01:32:27,731 --> 01:32:30,461
And you can have that now.

949
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:32,568
I'll get you the rest tomorrow.

950
01:32:33,737 --> 01:32:35,671
You got a deal.

951
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:40,976
We do have one other problem,
and that's Mrs. Parsons.

952
01:32:41,044 --> 01:32:43,877
<i>She could still make a lot of trouble
for us, even from prison... </i>

953
01:32:43,947 --> 01:32:46,711
- and I really don't need that.
- I think I've solved that problem.

954
01:32:46,783 --> 01:32:50,184
- What do you mean?
- Let's say the problem has been buried.

955
01:32:50,253 --> 01:32:53,654
- Really?
- She's gone, I promise you.

956
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:06,394
You're not very good
at keeping promises, Nick.

957
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:09,165
You gonna do something?

958
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:11,207
What are you talking to me for?
She's the one with the gun.

959
01:33:19,683 --> 01:33:22,675
<i>They're tough in Louisiana, Libby. </i>

960
01:33:22,752 --> 01:33:25,277
You shoot me,
they'll give you the gas chamber.

961
01:33:25,355 --> 01:33:27,516
No, they won't.

962
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,684
It's called double jeopardy.
I learned a few things in prison, Nick.

963
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,854
<i>I could shoot you in the middle
of Mardi Gras and they can't touch me. </i>

964
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:36,694
<i>As an ex-law professor,
I can assure you she is right. </i>

965
01:33:40,937 --> 01:33:43,064
Where's my son?

966
01:33:44,941 --> 01:33:47,705
In St. Albans School
in Georgia, all right?

967
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:51,641
You have your son back.
You got what you want.

968
01:34:02,292 --> 01:34:05,056
I haven't felt that good
in six years.

969
01:34:07,464 --> 01:34:09,557
I don't want to kill you, Nick.

970
01:34:09,632 --> 01:34:11,827
I just want you to suffer
like I suffered.

971
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:14,426
<i>What she means, Nick, is,
you're going to prison... </i>

972
01:34:14,504 --> 01:34:16,734
for murder.

973
01:34:16,806 --> 01:34:19,172
- Who did I supposedly murder?
- Me.

974
01:34:23,079 --> 01:34:25,980
<i>- All you've got is an old fax photo.
- Which supplies the motive. </i>

975
01:34:26,049 --> 01:34:28,517
Your wife, whom you had framed,
tracks you down...

976
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:31,349
and to keep her from exposing you,
you kill her.

977
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:34,015
You won't get away with it.

978
01:34:34,090 --> 01:34:36,149
Well, I think
I've solved that problem.

979
01:34:36,226 --> 01:34:38,854
<i>- What do you mean?
- Let's say the problem has been buried. </i>

980
01:34:38,928 --> 01:34:41,829
<i>- Really?
- She's gone, I promise you. </i>

981
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,698
Taped confessions are
very persuasive in court, Nick...

982
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:48,704
<i>and of course there is... </i>

983
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:51,832
the physical evidence that we're gonna
put in the trunk of your car.

984
01:34:51,908 --> 01:34:54,877
<i>A shovel, hair, my fingerprints,
a little blood. </i>

985
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:57,845
<i>- Don't forget the gasoline.
- It'll look like you burned... </i>

986
01:34:57,914 --> 01:35:01,042
and buried my body
just like you say on the tape.

987
01:35:01,117 --> 01:35:04,348
The prosecution rests.
You better get out of here.

988
01:35:04,421 --> 01:35:06,389
<i>Nobody wants a dead woman
walking around when the police... </i>

989
01:35:06,456 --> 01:35:09,892
<i>are trying to arrest a guy
for her murder. </i>

990
01:35:09,959 --> 01:35:12,359
Wait a minute.
I'll take that gun.

991
01:36:32,141 --> 01:36:34,609
Well, Lehman, you gonna live?

992
01:36:37,313 --> 01:36:39,304
I doubt it.

993
01:36:39,382 --> 01:36:41,976
Ms. Parsons, since you are
still legally his wife...

994
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:45,248
I expect you just inherited yourself
a right fine little hotel here.

995
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:48,085
Not interested.

996
01:36:55,631 --> 01:36:57,599
I guess I'm gonna
take off now.

997
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:02,933
No. No, you're not. You're a parole
violator. You're in my c-custody.

998
01:37:03,005 --> 01:37:06,270
You're going with me to Seattle...

999
01:37:06,342 --> 01:37:09,937
where I will demand
a full pardon and a parade...

1000
01:37:10,012 --> 01:37:12,310
and a little pink poodle...

1001
01:37:13,382 --> 01:37:15,247
on a key chain.

1002
01:37:26,562 --> 01:37:28,496
<i>Come on, Ryan, pass it!</i>

1003
01:37:43,813 --> 01:37:47,715
What are you waiting for?
Go on.

1004
01:37:50,152 --> 01:37:54,919
I don't know if I've ever been
so scared in my whole life.

1005
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:57,925
I think a big part of me
never thought I'd really find him.

1006
01:38:00,663 --> 01:38:03,757
What if he doesn't recognize me?

1007
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:06,131
- I mean, maybe after all this time...
- Damn, woman!

1008
01:38:06,202 --> 01:38:09,603
Because of you, I have lost a perfectly
good used car, and a not-so-good job.

1009
01:38:09,672 --> 01:38:11,970
If you don't go to this kid
right now...

1010
01:38:12,041 --> 01:38:14,475
I'm gonna have you
arrested for stupidity.

1011
01:38:14,543 --> 01:38:16,477
Go on.

1012
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:22,884
Thanks, Lehman.

1013
01:38:23,953 --> 01:38:25,887
You saved my life.

1014
01:38:29,959 --> 01:38:32,257
You saved mine too.

1015
01:38:45,307 --> 01:38:48,743
- Coach Matthews. How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

1016
01:38:48,811 --> 01:38:51,245
It'll be halftime soon.

1017
01:39:06,462 --> 01:39:09,295
Halftime!

1018
01:39:09,365 --> 01:39:11,560
Matty.

1019
01:39:12,434 --> 01:39:14,459
Matty.

1020
01:39:28,684 --> 01:39:31,380
Hi.

1021
01:39:34,323 --> 01:39:36,257
Do you know who I am?

1022
01:39:38,861 --> 01:39:40,795
They told me
you were dead.

1023
01:39:43,465 --> 01:39:45,399
No, sweetheart.
