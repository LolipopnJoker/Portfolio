1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,280
Here's my day so far:

2
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,080
went to jail,
lost the girl of my dreams,

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,560
and got my butt kicked pretty good.

4
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,280
Still, things could be a lot worse.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, that's right.

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm falling to my death.

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Guess they can't.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,880
How'd it all come to this, you ask?

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,960
My end starts at the beginning.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,120
The very beginning.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,640
Yes, that's me.

12
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,120
I had a fairly standard childhood.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,120
I came from, what you might call,
a broken home.

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,040
Literally broken.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,600
I was eight days old
and still living with my parents.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,960
How sad is that?

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
Clearly it was time to move on.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,160
Here is your minion.
He will take care of you.

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,800
And here is your binky.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,720
You are destined for...

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,120
I didn't quite hear that last part,
but it sounded important.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,920
- ...two, one.
- Destined for what?

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,440
I set out to find my destiny.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,280
Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt
quadrant had the exact same idea.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,720
That was the day
I met Mr. Goody Two-Shoes...

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,080
...and our glorious rivalry was born.

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,040
Could this be
what I was destined for?

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
A dream life filled with luxury.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,960
Apparently not.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,400
Even fate picks its favorites.

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
No big deal.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,880
A much different fate awaited me.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,280
A baby! How thoughtful.

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,200
Oh, yes.
Yes, I saw it and thought of you.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,160
Luckily I found
a lovely little place to call home.

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
Can we keep it?

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,240
A place that taught me
the differences between right...

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,720
...and wrong.

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Mr. Goody Two-Shoes,
on the other hand,

40
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,880
had life handed to him
on a silver platter.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,560
Our baby can fly.

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,920
Yes, yes, nothing
but the best for you, darling.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,360
The power of flight,
invulnerability, and great hair.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
But I had something far, far greater.

45
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,200
My amazing intellect...

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,880
...and knack
for building objects of mayhem.

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,680
After a few years, and with some
time off for good behavior,

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
I was given an opportunity
to better myself through learning...

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
...at a strange place called shool.

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,880
It was there that I once again ran
into Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,880
He had already amassed a gigantic army
of soft-headed groupies.

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
He bought their affections
with showmanship

53
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,840
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,840
So I, too, will make this popp-ed corn
and win over those mindless drones.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
Lights out.

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,480
That's when I learned
a very hard lesson:

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,320
Good receives all the praise
and adulation,

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,360
while evil is
sent to quiet-time in the corner.

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,800
So fitting in wasn't
really an option.

60
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,240
While they were learning
the Itsy Bitsy Spider...

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,400
...I learned how to dehydrate animate
objects and rehydrate them at will.

62
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,360
Some days, it felt like it was
just me and Minion against the world.

63
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
No matter how hard I tried,

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,760
I was always the odd man out,

65
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,680
the last one picked,

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,960
the screw-up, the black sheep...

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,480
Get him!

68
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
- ...the bad boy.
- Freak!

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,040
Weirdo!

70
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
Was this my destiny?

71
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Wait, maybe it was.

72
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,440
Being bad is
the one thing I'm good at.

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,720
Then it hit me:
If I was the bad boy,

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,880
then I was going to be
the baddest boy of them all.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,200
I was destined to be
a super-villain,

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,040
and we were destined to be rivals.

77
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,120
The die had been cast,

78
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,480
and so began an enduring, epic,
lifelong career.

79
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
And I loved it.

80
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,160
He would win some.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
I would almost win others.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,280
He took the name Metro Man,
defender of Metrocity.

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,080
I decided to pick something
a little more humble: Megamind...

85
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,040
...incredibly handsome criminal genius
and master of all villainy.

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,640
Read on your own time. Open up.

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,080
- Hey!
- Boo!

88
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
Oh, good morning, Warden.

89
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,520
Great news: I'm a changed man, and...

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,440
...and I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,000
You're a villain,
and you'll always be a villain.

92
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,840
You'll never change,
and you'll never Ieave.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,320
You're fun.

94
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
You got a present in the mail.

95
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,280
Is it a puppy?

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,600
From Metro Man. "To count every
second of your 85 Iife sentences."

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,040
That's funny. Never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

98
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920
Oh, but he does have nice taste.
I think I'll keep it.

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,200
Any chance you could give me the time?

100
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,320
I don't want to be Iate for the opening
of the Metro Man Museum.

101
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh no. Looks Iike
you're gonna miss it,

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,080
by several thousand years.

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,640
Oh, am I?

104
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Happy Metro Man Day, Metro City.

105
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
It's a beautiful day
in beautiful downtown,

106
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
where we're here to honor
a beautiful man, Metro Man.

107
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,720
His heart is an ocean
that's inside a bigger ocean.

108
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,200
For years he's been watching us
with his super-vision,

109
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,880
saving us with his super-strength
and caring for us with his super-heart.

110
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,840
Now it's our turn
to give something back.

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,960
This is Roxanne Ritchi,
reporting Iive

112
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,560
from the dedication
of the Metro Man Museum.

113
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Wow. OK, the stuff
they make you read on-air,

114
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
that's un-freaking-believable.
It's crazy.

115
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,200
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

116
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
What I was trying to say was,

117
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,640
I can't believe
that in our modern society,

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,320
they Iet, Iike,
actual art get onto the news.

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
- Nice save, Hal.
- What are we...

120
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,040
Like, Iet's just get
a coffee or something.

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,880
Come on, it's time to get
in the Metro Man Day spirit.

122
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
Well, if I were Metro Man,

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,480
Megamind wouldn't be
kidnapping you all the time.

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,960
- That's the first thing.
- That's sweet, Hal.

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,440
And I'd be watching you,
Iike a dingo watches a human baby.

126
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
OK, that sounded...

127
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,320
- OK, that sounded a Iittle weird.
- A Iittle bit. Yeah.

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,680
And you're making a weird face,
and that's making me feel weird.

129
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,240
The point is, I would watch you
Iike someone...

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,720
Not Iove. We're not in Iove.
I'm not saying I Iove you.

131
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,120
Hey, I Iove you. Whatever.

132
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,200
But I'm not saying Iike
I'm in Iove with you. I'm saying...

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,360
Roxanne? Roxaroo?

134
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,440
- Whoa... What?
- Hey...

135
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Get back to work.
The city doesn't pay you to Ioaf.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
- Freeze!
- Whoa. What are you doing, guys?

137
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
It's me! It's the warden.

138
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,920
Hey! Open up!

139
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,600
No, you fools. He's tricked us.

140
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
You were right.

141
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,600
I'll always be a villain.

142
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,080
Well, hello good-Iooking.
Need a Iift?

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Certainly do,
you fantastic fish, you.

144
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,280
- Get in the car, you.
- I'm free!

145
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,880
Right?

146
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,000
Nice work sending me
the watch, Minion.

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,560
- You got it, boss.
- Punch it!

148
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,200
AII right,
put your hands in the air.

149
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Metro Man!

150
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,120
- Who's your man?
- Metro Man!

151
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Yeah, Metro City!

152
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,120
Gimme some. Come on. Give it now.

153
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,160
Give it to me. Right on.
Gimme the good stuff. AII right.

154
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,720
Hey, Metro City.

155
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Hey. Hey.

156
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,560
You know, you know,
I just want to bring it down a bit.

157
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,840
Boys, a Iittle Iower.
Thank you, fellas.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,240
Let's get real for a moment.

159
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,680
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

160
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,400
Although getting a whole museum
is super-cool, is super-cool,

161
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,800
you want to know what the greatest
honor you've given me is?

162
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,680
Do you really want to know? Really?

163
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
I'll tell you.

164
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,920
The greatest honor you've
given me is Ietting me serve you,

165
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
the helpless people of Metro City.

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,520
And at the end of every day,

167
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,760
well, I often ask myself...

168
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,320
...who would I be without you?

169
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,440
- I Iove you, Metro Man!
- And I Iove you, random citizen.

170
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,560
I tell you, Minion.
There's no place Iike evil Iair.

171
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,840
I've kept it cold and damp
just for you, sir.

172
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,600
How do I Iook, Minion?
Do I Iook bad?

173
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,640
Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
You always know what to say.

175
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,640
Oh, the brain-bots
certainly missed you, sir.

176
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,280
Did you miss your daddy?
Who's a menacing Iittle cyborg?

177
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,680
You are. Yes, you are. No biting.

178
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
No, no, no, no, no, no.

179
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.

180
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,160
- Oh, Iook at that.
- Now, back to Iaughing.

181
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,600
She's awake. Quick, to work.

182
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,520
Miss Ritchi, we meet again.

183
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Would it kill you to wash the bag?

184
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,800
You can scream all you wish,
Miss Ritchi.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

186
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,720
Wh... Why isn't she screaming?

187
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,520
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind?

188
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,200
Like this...

189
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,120
But that's, that's a poor Iady scream.

190
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,720
He's a Iittle better.

191
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
Is there some kind
of nerdy super-villain Web site

192
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,560
where you get Tesla coils
and blinky dials?

193
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Actually, most of it comes
from an outlet store in...

194
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,760
Don't answer that.

195
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,920
- Romania.
- Don't! Stop!

196
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,320
She's using her
nosy reporter skills

197
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,920
on your weak-willed mind
to find out all our secrets.

198
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,000
Such tricks won't work on me...

199
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,840
- Please talk slower.
- ...temptress.

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,080
What secrets?
You're so predictable.

201
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,240
Predictable? Predictable?

202
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,040
Oh, you call this predictable?

203
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,920
Your alligators. Yes.

204
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah, I was thinking about it
on the way over.

205
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,360
What's this? Boom! In your face.

206
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,560
- Cliché.
- No! Look, watch.

207
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,600
- Juvenile.
- Shock and awe.

208
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,200
- Tacky.
- Oh, it's so scary!

209
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,000
- Seen it.
- What's this one do?

210
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
Garish.

211
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,120
- OK, the spider's new.
- Spider?

212
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,440
Yes. The... The spee-ider.

213
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,920
Even the smallest bite
from Arachnis deathicus

214
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,600
will instantly paralyze...

215
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
Get it off! It bit me!

216
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,240
Give it up, Megamind.
Your plans never work.

217
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,160
Let's stop wasting time and call
your boyfriend in tights, shall we?

218
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,640
It is with great pleasure that
I present to Metro Man his new museum.

219
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,160
If you please.

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,160
- Metro Man!
- Hey! My kid can't see.

221
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,800
- Megamind!
- Oh, bravo, Metro Man.

222
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,520
Boo!

223
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,520
Yes, I can play along too. Boo!

224
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,800
Should've known
you'd try to crash the party.

225
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,120
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

226
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,880
This is a day you and Metrocity
shall not soon forget.

227
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,080
It's pronounced Metro City!

228
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,120
Potato-tomato, potato-tomato.

229
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,640
We all know how this ends:
with you behind bars.

230
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm shaking in my custom
baby seal leather boots.

231
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,160
You will leave Metrocity,
or this will be the last

232
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,080
you ever hear
of Roxanne Ritchi.

233
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,520
Roxanne! Don't panic, Roxie.

234
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,520
- I'm on my way.
- Yeah, I'm not panicking.

235
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,760
In order to stop me,
you need to find me first, Metro Man.

236
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,440
We're at the abandoned observatory.

237
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,640
No, we're not!

238
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,840
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.

239
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,120
Metro Man approaching, sir.

240
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,360
Hold on a second.

241
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,400
Oh, good heavens!

242
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,480
You didn't think you
were in the real observatory, did you?

243
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,640
Ready the death ray, Minion.

244
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
Death ray, readying.

245
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,000
Over here, old friend.

246
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,680
In case you haven't noticed,
you've fallen right into my trap.

247
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,840
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

248
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,200
Even the most heartfelt belief
can be corroded over time.

249
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,840
Justice is a non-corrosive metal.

250
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,480
But metals can be melted
by the heat of revange.

251
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,560
It's "revenge,"
and it's best served cold.

252
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
But it can be easily reheated
in the microwave of evil.

253
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,680
Well, I think your warranty is
about to expire.

254
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,040
Maybe I got an extended warranty.

255
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,840
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for its intended purpose.

256
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,120
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

257
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,680
Of course. That is,
if Metro Man can withstand the full,

258
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,360
concentrated power of the sun!

259
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,640
Fire!

260
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,080
Minion. Fire?

261
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,720
- It's still warming up, sir.
- Come again?

262
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,240
- Warming up, sir.
- Warming up? The sun is warming up?

263
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,520
One second more and...

264
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,560
...just tippy-tappy tippy-tap-tap,
tip-top more,

265
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,920
- and we are ready in just...
- Honestly!

266
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,240
On my way, Roxie.

267
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,520
I told you to have things ready.
I told you countless times.

268
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Why do you always blame me?

269
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,560
My spider bite is acting up.

270
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,000
Your plan is failing. Just admit it.

271
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,560
Yeah, good Iuck with that one.

272
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,080
Whose side are you on?

273
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,080
- The Iosing side.
- Thank you.

274
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,000
Could someone stamp
my Frequent Kidnapping Card?

275
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,320
You of all people know
we discontinued that promotion.

276
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
- Ciao-ciao, all!
- Same time next week?

277
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,480
Dag! Crab nuggets!

278
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,240
- What did he just say?
- "Crab nuggets"?

279
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,680
Fackled fish cracker!

280
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Ten seconds to full power.

281
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,320
- Good Iord, I'm trapped.
- Ten...

282
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,320
- What kind of trickery is this?
- ...nine...

283
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,200
- You mad genius.
- ...eight...

284
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
- Your dark gift has finally paid off.
- ...seven...

285
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,920
- It... It has?
- ...six...

286
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,880
This dome is
obviously Iined with copper.

287
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,320
- Yeah? So?
- Sir...

288
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
- Copper drains my powers.
- ...two...

289
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,440
- Your weakness is copper?
- ...one.

290
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,040
- You're kidding, right?
- Full power.

291
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,640
I don't think
even he could survive that.

292
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,800
Well, Iet's not get
our hopes up just yet.

293
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
- Look!
- Metro Man!

294
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,520
Metro Man.

295
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,080
Metro Man!

296
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,320
- You... You did it, sir.
- I did it?

297
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,400
He did it.

298
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,720
- I did it?
- He did it.

299
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,200
- You did it, sir.
- I did it!

300
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,360
- You did it!
- I did it! Metrocity is mine!

301
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
- You did it, sir!
- I did it! Yeah, me, me!

302
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,960
- Yes, I did it!
- Us! We both did it!

303
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,920
- Not us! I!
- You, a Iittle more

304
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,840
- than me but still, come on!
- A Iot more than you.

305
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,280
When they're giving out the awards,

306
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,920
- I'm gonna be right there next to you.
- What awards? What awards, for what?

307
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,960
Hit it!

308
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Drop 'em!

309
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,160
First off, what a turnout.

310
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
How wild is this?

311
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,080
AII I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

312
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,000
Are there any questions?
Go on. Yes! You in the back.

313
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,160
I'm sure we'd all Iike to know what
you plan to do with us and this city.

314
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,960
Good, I'm glad you asked that.

315
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,600
Imagine the most horrible, terrifying,

316
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
evil thing you can possibly think of,

317
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,800
and multiply it... by six!

318
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,440
In the meantime,

319
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,840
I want you to carry on
with the dreary, normal things

320
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,520
you normal people do.

321
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,840
Let's just have fun with this. Come on.

322
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,480
And I will get back to you.

323
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,400
Now slam the door really hard.

324
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,600
They... They can still see you.

325
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,080
- Now?
- Your elbow's still in.

326
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Good.

327
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,600
There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord

328
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,320
Oh, Minion, did you think
this day would ever come?

329
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,680
No way. Not at all, sir.

330
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Never. Never in a million...
I mean...

331
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,040
- Yes, I did.
- Look at the intricate mouldings.

332
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,080
I'm Iooking. I'm Iooking.

333
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,000
And what's this?

334
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,200
It's Iike one of the giant monitors
in the Iair.

335
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
But it seems to only carry one station.

336
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,440
Oh, that, sir, is called a window.

337
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,080
- Window?
- AII the kids are Iooking through them.

338
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,960
I've never had a view before.

339
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,440
Metrocity, Minion, it's all mine.

340
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,920
If my parents could see me now.

341
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

342
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
And now that Mr. Goody Two-Shoes is
out of the way,

343
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,400
I can have everything I want,

344
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,920
and there's no one to stop me!

345
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,840
I know. I know.

346
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,760
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

347
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,920
I understand you,
Iittle well-dressed bird.

348
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,360
Purposeless, emptiness.
It's a vacuum, isn't it?

349
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,240
It's... What's your vacuum Iike?

350
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.

351
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,480
I'm in a heated,
existential discussion

352
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,280
with this dead-eyed, plastic desk toy.

353
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,040
Is... Is something wrong, sir?

354
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,400
Just think about it.

355
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,120
We have it all.

356
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,840
Yet, we have nothing.

357
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,320
It's just too easy now.

358
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm sorry, you've Iost me, sir.

359
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,720
I mean, we did it, right?

360
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,160
Well, you did it, sir.

361
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,800
Yes, you've made that perfectly clear.

362
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,880
Then why do I feel so... mel-on-choly.

363
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,560
"Mel-on-choly"?

364
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,360
- Unhappy.
- Well...

365
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
What if tomorrow,

366
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,720
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

367
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,800
That always seems to Iift your spirits.

368
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,480
Good idea, Minion.
But without him, what's the point?

369
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,600
- "Him," sir?
- Nothing.

370
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,360
OK, all right. We'll just...
that's something to consider...

371
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,520
...and... Well, I think I'll just
power down for a while then.

372
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,480
He was always there for us. Dependable.

373
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,160
Perhaps we took him for granted.
You know, maybe,

374
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,520
we never really know how good
we have it until it's gone.

375
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,600
We miss you, Metro Man. I miss you.

376
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,200
And I have just one question
for Megamind: Are you happy now?

377
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,240
This is Roxanne Ritchi,
reporting from a city without a hero.

378
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,120
Coming up next, are you ready to be
a slave army? What you need to know.

379
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,600
And... wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas,

380
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,560
- 'cause we're done.
- OK. See you tomorrow, Hal.

381
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,840
Wait. Roxie, I'm having a party
at my house.

382
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
It's gonna be, Iike,
off the hook, or whatever.

383
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,600
You should come over.
I got a deejay,

384
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,640
rented a bouncy house,
made a gallon of dip.

385
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,800
It's gonna be sick.

386
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,560
Oh. I... I don't know, Hal.

387
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
I don't really feel Iike being
around a bunch of people.

388
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
No, no, no, that's the best part.
It'll just be Iike you and me.

389
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,720
Wow. That... that's certainly
very tempting, but...

390
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,320
I did hire a wedding photographer.
That's just in case we were Iike,

391
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,160
something crazy happened
and we wanted a picture of it.

392
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,760
Like, maybe we should have this for,
Iike, ever. Like a memory, you know?

393
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,720
I'm gonna pass.

394
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,560
I have some work here
that I need to do, anyway.

395
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,960
Cool. So Thursday? Soft Thursday?

396
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,400
- Good night, Hal.
- That's a soft yes on Thursday.

397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,280
What's wrong with me?
Rented a bouncy house?

398
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,160
Chicks don't Iike bouncy houses.

399
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,920
They Iike clowns.

400
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,080
Stupid van! You broke my finger!

401
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,400
I've made a horrible mistake.

402
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,000
I didn't mean to destroy you.

403
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,000
I mean, I meant to destroy you,

404
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,280
but I didn't think
it would really work.

405
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,880
What are we supposed to do?

406
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,720
Without you, evil is running rampant
through the streets.

407
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,400
I'm so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

408
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,520
What's the point of being bad

409
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,920
when there's no good
to try and stop you?

410
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
Someone has to stop Megamind.

411
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,640
- Hey, we're closing soon.
- You scared me.

412
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,120
- Barry, right?
- Bernard.

413
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,600
Bernard. I was just...
Well, I was talking to myself.

414
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,360
You probably think
I'm a Iittle bit nuts.

415
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,320
I'm not allowed to insult
guests directly.

416
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,400
Thank you. Just...
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

417
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,160
OK.

418
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
Thanks.

419
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,920
I had so many evil plans in the works.

420
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,320
The illiteracy beam.

421
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,160
Typhoon cheese.

422
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
Robo-sheep.

423
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,920
Battles we will now never have.

424
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,160
You know,
I never had the chance to say goodbye.

425
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
So it's good
that we have this time now.

426
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,880
You know, before I destroy the place.

427
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,320
Nothing personal, it just brings back
too many painful memories.

428
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,560
Hello?

429
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,720
- Hello?
- Roxanne.

430
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,000
- That's a pretty tasteless costume.
- Costume?

431
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,920
Megamind's head is not
that grossly exaggerated.

432
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,240
And you even made a cheap replica
of his dehydration gun. How...

433
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,000
Hello? Is someone there?

434
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,600
Hello? Who's there?

435
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,880
It's just you, Bernard.

436
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Yes. It's just me. Bernard.

437
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,040
Well, thank you
for Ietting me stay.

438
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than
two minutes and 37 seconds

439
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,440
if I were you. We're having
the walls and ceiling removed.

440
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,840
Wow, that sounds Iike quite
the renovation.

441
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,640
I guess I'll catch
a ride down with you then.

442
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,040
I kept thinking he was gonna do
one of his Iast-minute escapes.

443
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,520
Yeah. He was really good at those.

444
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
Oh, if only the world had
a reset button.

445
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,440
I've Iooked into the reset button.

446
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,320
The science is impossible.

447
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,120
Oh, Bernard...

448
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,040
I didn't know you had... feelings.
Are you OK?

449
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:20,520
Metro Man's gone. And now there's
no one Ieft to challenge Megamind.

450
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
Oh, come on, Bernard.

451
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,840
As Iong as there's evil,
good will rise up against it.

452
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,240
Oh, I wish.

453
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,120
I believe someone is gonna stand up
to Megamind.

454
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,600
- You really think so?
- Yeah. I mean, it's Iike they say,

455
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,280
"Heroes aren't born, they're made."

456
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,760
Heroes can be made. That's it!

457
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,960
AII you need are
the right ingredients.

458
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,040
- Yeah. Bravery.
- Yes.

459
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,200
- Strength.
- Of course.

460
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,600
- Determination.
- Imperative!

461
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,760
And a smidgen of DNA.
Oh, with that, anyone can be a hero!

462
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,320
Yeah!

463
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,520
I think we should run!

464
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,280
Bye!

465
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
Time to put the past behind us.

466
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,560
Only the future...

467
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,120
I'm too close!
I'm genuinely scared right now.

468
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,240
I hope no one's seeing this!

469
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what?
Why would you do that?

470
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,080
So I have someone to fight.

471
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,760
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

472
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,800
A yin with no yang.

473
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,880
A bullfighter with no bull to fight.

474
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,520
In other words, I have no purpose.

475
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,840
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.
Go on! Ask!

476
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,480
How are you gonna do it?

477
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,080
I'm going to give someone...
I don't know who yet...

478
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,720
Metro Man's powers.

479
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm going to train that someone
to become Metrocity's new hero.

480
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,240
Over here! Follow!

481
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,920
And then finally,
I'm going to fight that hero

482
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,800
in an epic battle of good and evil.

483
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,640
Which will put everything back
the way it was...

484
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,120
...when the world was
perfect and rosy.

485
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,680
Behold, Minion, Metro Man's cape.

486
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,320
Look closely. Tell me what you see.

487
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,200
- Dandruff?
- Yes. It's his DNA.

488
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,200
From this, we'll extract the source
of Metro Man's awesome power.

489
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,200
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

490
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,800
Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea
for the greater good of man.

491
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,800
But I'm saying this is
a kind of bad that...

492
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,840
...OK, you might think is good
in your bad perception,

493
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,960
but from a good perception it...
it's just plain bad.

494
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Oh, you don't know
what's good for bad.

495
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,000
Now, we have just one shot at this.

496
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,560
We must find a suitable subject,
someone of noble heart and mind.

497
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,320
Who puts the welfare of others
above their own.

498
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,040
What on Earth is that?

499
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,640
It seems to be emanating
from there, sir.

500
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,360
OIIo.

501
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,840
It's "Hello."

502
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,320
Hello? Like that?

503
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,840
- Bernard, it's Roxanne.
- It's Roxanne.

504
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I just wanted to thank you
for inspiring me the other day.

505
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,680
- Oh, you inspired me too.
- Great!

506
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,280
It's time we stood up to Megamind
and show him he can't push us around.

507
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Oh, really? She's so cute.

508
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,920
I'm already hot on his trail.

509
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,360
- And what gives you that idea?
- Sir?

510
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,200
I just found his secret hideout.

511
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,960
How did she find my hideout?!

512
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,560
How did you find his hideout?

513
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,040
This is the only building in Metro City
with a fake observatory on the roof.

514
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,040
OK. There's no way
she'll find the secret entrance.

515
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,240
There's a doormat here
that says "Secrit Entrance"!

516
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,320
- Minion!
- I kept forgetting where it was.

517
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,080
She'll discover all our secrets!

518
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,960
- Oh, no!
- You dim-witted creation of science!

519
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,640
- What?
- What? Oh, no, not you, Roxanne.

520
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,280
No, I was just yelling at my...
mother's urn.

521
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,120
Don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

522
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,720
Roxanne?

523
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,400
Oh no, not again!

524
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,000
Roxanne?

525
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,920
I'm glad you're here.
Wait, how did you get here so fast?

526
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,720
Well, I... I happened to be
speed walking nearby when you called.

527
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,000
In a suit?

528
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,720
It's called... formal speed walking,
but that's not important.

529
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,040
I better take the Iead.
This way Iooks exciting.

530
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,520
No, it says "Exit."

531
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,400
Which is the abbreviation
for "exciting," right?

532
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,840
This is the mother Iode!

533
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,760
- Wow. Just Iook at this thing.
- Wow.

534
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,480
You know, I really could use
your help in deciphering all this.

535
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,000
- Really?
- You're an expert

536
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,640
- on all things Megamind, right?
- Yes. Right.

537
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,560
Together, we could figure out his plan
for the city and stop it.

538
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,400
- Are you in?
- Oh, what fun!

539
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,640
That's what I want to hear.

540
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,920
Minion, Code: Send In The Brain-bots.

541
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
You know,
the whole point of a code is...

542
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,280
Oh, Code: Just Do It, Minion.

543
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,920
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

544
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,440
- It's me, you fools!
- Bernard!

545
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,080
It's Daddy!

546
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,960
Megamind.

547
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,640
- What have you done with Bernard?
- Oh, Bernard? Oh, yes.

548
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,880
I'm doing horrible things to that man.

549
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,520
I don't want to get into it,
but Iasers, spikes.

550
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,920
No, please! No!
Not the Iasers and the spikes!

551
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,280
- You know the drill.
- Oh, no! Not the drill!

552
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,880
- Let him go or...
- Or what?

553
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,120
Or I'm gonna find out
what this weird-Iooking gun does.

554
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,560
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!

555
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,160
I'll just go get him.

556
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,800
- Unhand me, you fiend!
- Never!

557
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,160
His strength's too much!

558
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,720
Oh, I work out!

559
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,560
Well, it's really paying off!
You're so fit,

560
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,800
and strangely charismatic.

561
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,600
Are you OK?

562
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,600
I did my best, but he's too fantastic.

563
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,840
Here. Let me carry
that heavy gun for you.

564
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,440
I got us covered.

565
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,680
- Let go. It's mine!
- Bernard, run!

566
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,080
Roxanne?

567
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,040
- You're going to break it!
- Give it to me!

568
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh, no!

569
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,120
Roxanne?!

570
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,600
Who on Earth is that?

571
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,720
- Help!
- Roxanne!

572
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,320
Bernard! You were right
about that door being exciting.

573
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,880
- Intruder! Intruder!
- This way.

574
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,480
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

575
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,760
What are you doing?

576
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,760
This'll stop them. Here!

577
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,720
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?

578
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,320
- Just throw it!
- Daddy's sorry.

579
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,800
- Wow. That was really exciting.
- Yeah.

580
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
- You were very strong in there.
- I know.

581
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,560
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him Iike that.

582
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,800
- What's going on?
- Hal, what happened?

583
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,760
I think a bee flew up my nose.

584
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,520
I was just about to make
my frontal assault to rescue you,

585
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,400
but Iike 50 ninjas tried to attack me,
so I had to beat 'em all up,

586
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,480
and I did, and I... They were all,
Iike, crying and stuff...

587
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,800
- Wow, a brave one, isn't he?
- Who are you?

588
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,120
Oh, thi... this is Bernard.
He's my partner.

589
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,640
- Partner?
- Yes. Yes. Partner.

590
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,920
Well, Iook, "partner," I'm her partner.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

591
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,440
She's been through
a traumatic experience.

592
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,040
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

593
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,280
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

594
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
Yeah, OK. I'd Iike that.

595
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,560
That was weird for everybody,

596
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,760
'cause you accidentally hugged him
instead of me.

597
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,200
Sir? Sir!

598
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,760
Code: Did You Find Out Who It Was?

599
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,520
Code: Get The Car.

600
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,840
Code: Right Away, Sir.

601
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,120
- Bye-bye!
- See you tomorrow, Hal.

602
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,680
I'll Ieave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me Iater.

603
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,920
Who is this man
we've infused with godlike power?

604
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,640
Well, sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's 28 years old.

605
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,080
No criminal record.
Actually no records at all.

606
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,800
Apparently this man hasn't
accomplished anything.

607
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,800
Not yet, Minion. Not... yet.

608
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,760
Could this day get anymore fun-tastic?

609
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,920
So, I will just go ahead and diffuse him
since this is clearly a mistake.

610
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,080
No, Minion! There's something
much more powerful at work here.

611
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,760
This is no mistake. It's destiny.

612
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,400
Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!

613
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,920
Hal? Hal Shtewart?

614
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,840
- Hey! In the bed!
- Am I saying it right?

615
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,360
"Stewart."

616
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,280
Is this a robbery?

617
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,880
'Cause the Iady across the hall
has way better stuff than me.

618
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,160
Oh, Iook, it's Hal Stewart.
Quick, the spray.

619
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,640
AII out.

620
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,040
- Well, use the Forget-Me Stick.
- Oh, right.

621
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,320
Just Iook at him.

622
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,960
No, he doesn't Iook quite
the hero-type to me.

623
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,880
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

624
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,040
A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.

625
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,600
I smell a hero.

626
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,120
I smell something burning.

627
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,320
I think it's working. Places! Places!

628
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,600
Places! Places! Places.

629
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,120
Do you have your disguise?

630
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,080
What?

631
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,920
Oh, you Iook fantastic.

632
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,280
Rise my glorious creation.

633
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,240
Rise, and come to Papa.

634
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,600
- What's going on?
- Easy my child.

635
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,040
- Who are you?
- I sent you to this planet

636
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,080
to teach you about justice,
honor, and nobility.

637
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,400
I am your father.

638
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,520
So you're Iike my space dad?

639
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,440
Yeah, I'm Iike your space dad.

640
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,720
And you are what?

641
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
I'm your space stepmom.

642
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,680
I've had some
work done recently.

643
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,640
Is this some kind of dream?

644
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,880
This is a dream come true.

645
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,200
You've been blessed
with unfathomable power.

646
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,280
- What kind of power?
- Unfathomable.

647
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,800
It's unf... without fathom.

648
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,200
Yeah. We've come to guide you

649
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,080
on your path
to be Metrocity's new hero

650
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,400
and battle the super-genius
of Megamind.

651
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,720
I know this is a Iot to take in.

652
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,960
It may take months
for you to come to grips.

653
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,920
No freaking way!

654
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,920
I wasn't finished.

655
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,160
I'm gonna be a hero!

656
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,960
I'm gonna be a hero!

657
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,960
See, Minion, he's perfect!

658
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,600
And... action!

659
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,440
- Someone help me!
- I'm OK!

660
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,320
You... Bad!

661
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,160
Zap! Zap! Zap!

662
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,040
The flames of my evil burn bright.

663
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,760
Now you say something cool
back at me.

664
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Look. It doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

665
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,800
No, no, no, no, no. Stomach down,
hands up. Like Metro Man.

666
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,840
- Whoa! Wait!
- Watch out.

667
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,440
He's hopeless. Hopeless!

668
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,160
- Maybe we should change tactics.
- You think so?

669
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,880
Oh, you know how boys are.

670
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,400
They Iove video games.

671
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,120
- I could throw a few parts together.
- Can't wait.

672
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,160
LOL. Smiley face.

673
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,600
Can't wait for what, sir?

674
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,760
That was such a funny story.

675
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,600
And brilliantly told, by the way.

676
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,320
OK, now you tell one.

677
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,960
Bernard, I never knew
you were so funny.

678
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,560
And I never heard you Iaugh before.

679
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,840
Yeah, it's been a while.
Feels pretty good.

680
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,440
And action.

681
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,840
Gotcha!

682
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,840
- You don't get out much, do you?
- Oh, what fun!

683
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,160
I used to come here
with my mother when I was a kid.

684
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,000
It was one of my favorite things to do.

685
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,440
Now Iook at it. It's a dump.

686
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,240
Why are we cleaning up the city, sir?

687
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,880
Well, we don't want to battle
our new hero in a dump now, do we?

688
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,960
They're all back. But how? Why?

689
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,480
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

690
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
That's it.

691
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,640
Be free, my beautiful dove!

692
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,520
OK, OK.

693
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,960
Metro Man and I were never a couple.

694
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,240
- But I thought you two were...
- I know. Everybody did.

695
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,080
It's just...
Well, he was never really my type.

696
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,520
Really?

697
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,720
OK, now you tell me something.

698
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,640
Something you've never told anyone.

699
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,920
Well, in sh... school...

700
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,800
...none of the other kids
really Iiked me.

701
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,240
I was always the Iast one picked
for everything.

702
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,680
It's too bad that we didn't go
to the same school.

703
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,920
Hal, I think you're ready for this.

704
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,000
- Do I have a son?
- No.

705
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,800
You make me Iaugh.

706
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,960
It stretches. It's for you.

707
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,760
Hey, what's the T stand for?

708
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,240
Titan.

709
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,360
"Titan"?
What's that supposed to mean?

710
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,040
It was the only name
I could trademark.

711
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,080
Do you have someone special
in your Iife, Hal?

712
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,280
No, not yet. But... there's this
really, really good-Iooking one

713
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,560
I've got my eye on currently.

714
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,080
That's very good.

715
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,560
- Romance is very inspiring.
- That's what I hear.

716
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,600
AII you have to do is
save her and she'll be yours.

717
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,360
- Who wants churros?
- I do!

718
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,600
- I do, yeah. Thanks, Space Stepmom.
- Churros all the way around.

719
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,400
On the count of three,
unsheathe your churro.

720
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,160
One, two, three!

721
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,440
To Titan!

722
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,800
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind,
and the city will know your name.

723
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,480
...the city's parks restored
to their original glory,

724
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,520
the streets the safest they've been,
the banks reopened.

725
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,600
Has something happened to Megamind?

726
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,480
Has someone tamed this monster?

727
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,800
This is Roxanne Ritchi,
cautiously optimistic,

728
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
and pleasantly confused.

729
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,160
Well, you seem
in a very good mood tonight, sir.

730
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, yes. How Iong is
this going to take, Minion?

731
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,080
Just a few alterations, sir,
and I will be done

732
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,400
with your most terrifying cape yet!

733
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,920
I'm calling it...

734
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,280
...the Black Mamba...

735
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,080
Black Mamba. Perfect.

736
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,000
Gosh, I am running Iate.
I have to go.

737
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,240
What? Where...
Where are you going, sir?

738
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,680
We have our debut battle
with Titan tomorrow morning.

739
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,800
We haven't even tested
your big battle suit yet.

740
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,880
You attend to the details, Minion.
I have to... run a quick errand.

741
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,320
You don't run errands.

742
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,800
- What's going on here?
- What?

743
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,200
Oh, wait a minute.

744
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,880
Are you wearing
Jean Paul Gaultier's Pour Homme?

745
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,440
It's just my natural musk.
Now, where are the car keys?

746
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This is about Ms. Ritchi,
isn't it?

747
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,600
You're going on a date with her.

748
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,280
No, my main man.
Get out of town.

749
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,120
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.
You've fallen in Iove with her.

750
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,680
You are forgetting your place, Minion.
Now give me the keys.

751
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,840
What happens when Roxanne
finds out who you really are?

752
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,480
She will never find out.
That's the point of Iying.

753
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,120
Honestly, if I didn't know
any better,

754
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,240
I'd think this was
your first day of being evil.

755
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,800
No!

756
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,240
This has gone far enough!

757
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,400
Oh, that was really grown-up!

758
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,640
Sir, sir, please.
It's for your own good.

759
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,240
Oh, what do you know?

760
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,640
I may not know much,
but I do know this:

761
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,560
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

762
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,520
Maybe I don't want to be
the bad guy anymore.

763
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
You heard me!

764
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,600
Who are you?

765
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,640
- Now, give me the keys!
- No!

766
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,280
My sole purpose in Iife is
to Iook after you.

767
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,440
Well, I don't need you
to Iook after me.

768
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,920
What are you s... What are you saying?
You don't need me?

769
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,640
Let me make it clear.
Code: I Don't Need You.

770
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,640
You know what? You know what?

771
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,680
Code: I'll Just Pack My Thing And Go!

772
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,640
- Code: Fine!
- Code: Fine Back!

773
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,760
- Well, good Iuck on your date!
- I will!

774
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,640
- That doesn't even make any sense!
- I know!

775
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,000
I know I am so close. I can feel it.

776
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,280
OK, OK. I just have
to take a step back.

777
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,600
Wait a minute.

778
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,160
"Titan."

779
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,480
- What's a Titan?
- My super-ears are burning.

780
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,720
I usually just hear criminals.
You haven't been naughty, have you?

781
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,840
I'm totally messing with you.
I'm totally messing with you.

782
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,680
- The name's Titan.
- Titan.

783
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,320
Your very own heroic guardian
of pure awesome.

784
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,720
What's your name? Just kidding.
I know everything about you.

785
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,520
And I...
And I brought some flowers.

786
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,160
Didn't know what you Iiked, so I
just grabbed, you know, all of them.

787
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
OK. You don't Iike flowers?
OK, forget the flowers.

788
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,640
What do you want?

789
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,160
Thought maybe we could go
for a Iittle flight around town.

790
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,800
Get to know each other first.

791
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,440
This must be
very thrilling for you.

792
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,920
What do you think you're doing?!

793
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,360
Oh, am I moving too fast?
You're probably right.

794
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,280
I should just rescue you a few times
before we get all romantic.

795
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,280
Saved ya.

796
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,320
You are Iucky to have
such a great hero here.

797
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,360
- Don't you ever...
- Oh, no! Somebody do something!

798
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,440
Oh, right, right, duh.
I gotcha. I gotcha.

799
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,840
That was a close one.
You almost died,

800
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,680
- but I saved you.
- Building!

801
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,760
Gotcha! I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

802
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,800
I couldn't hear you over the sound
of me saving your Iife.

803
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,520
Put me down! Right now!

804
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,160
OK, all right. AII right, hold on.

805
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,240
Are you crazy?

806
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,560
I suppose I'm a,
I'm a Iittle crazy, about you.

807
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,000
Who are you, really?

808
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,600
Oh, right. Well, prepare to have
your mind blown, Iittle Iady.

809
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,280
- Ta-da.
- Hal?

810
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,240
Yeah. Isn't this great?
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

811
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,720
- No. It's not great.
- Wow. Our first fight.

812
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,600
This is so us.
We're Iike an old married couple.

813
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,720
Look, there is no "us," OK?
There will never be an "us."

814
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,720
But... I have powers.

815
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,760
I have a cape. I'm the good guy.

816
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,400
You are a good guy, Hal,
but you don't understand.

817
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,440
- We need to find out why...
- No, no. This...

818
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,200
- Hal, just take a deep breath
- This isn't right!

819
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,160
- and Iisten to me for a moment.
- You're supposed to be with me!

820
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,600
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

821
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,280
It's Titan!
It's Titan, not Hal!

822
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,800
- Bernard.
- Roxanne.

823
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,240
- Sorry I'm Iate.
- Wow, your hair Iooks exciting.

824
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,320
Not the only exciting development
of the night.

825
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,040
Megamind's created a new hero,
and I know why.

826
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,600
It all makes sense now.
He missed getting his butt kicked,

827
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,040
so he created a new hero

828
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,880
- to kick it for him.
- Yeah.

829
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,480
But why would he pick Hal?

830
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,960
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

831
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,480
Wow. That's a Iot to take in.

832
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,440
It boggles my mind.

833
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,800
I am extremely boggled.
You know, I'm sure we'll get

834
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,760
to the bottom
of who's kicking whose butt.

835
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,560
But in the meantime,
Iet's enjoy each other's company.

836
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,400
I'm sorry, Bernard,
of course, you're right.

837
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,200
You know, I could use a breather.

838
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,680
To Bernard,

839
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,160
for being the only normal thing
in my crazy, upside-down world.

840
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,600
To... being normal.

841
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,760
- Roxanne?
- Yes?

842
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,600
Say I wasn't so normal.

843
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,400
Let's say I was bald
and had the complexion of,

844
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,520
of a popular primary color,
as a random, nonspecific example.

845
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,320
- Would you still enjoy my company?
- Of course!

846
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,400
You don't judge a book by its cover
or a person from the outside.

847
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,760
That's a relief to hear.

848
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,800
You judge them based on their actions.

849
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,600
Well, that seems kind of petty,
don't you think?

850
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,360
What? What?

851
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,320
Don't Iook at me!
Just a technical glitch!

852
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,760
Don't Iook yet!
Well, never mind that.

853
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,280
OK.

854
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,960
Where were we?

855
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,160
- You...
- Now, now, hold on.

856
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,800
You!

857
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,520
I can explain!

858
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,880
What about everything you just said?

859
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,080
About judging a book by its cover?

860
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,160
Well, Iet's take a Iook
at the contents then, shall we?

861
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,440
You destroyed Metro Man,
you took over the city,

862
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,400
and then, you actually got me
to care about you!

863
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,240
Why are you so evil?
Tricking me?

864
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,400
What could you possibly hope to gain?

865
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,520
Wait a minute.
I don't believe this.

866
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,400
Do you really think
that I would ever be with you?

867
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,480
No.

868
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,120
OK, Minion! You were right!

869
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,240
I was... Iess right!

870
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,120
We should stick
to what we're good at... being bad.

871
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,320
Minion?

872
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,600
You there!

873
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,600
Yeah, you.

874
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,640
Bring out the Black Mamba.

875
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,360
OK, Titan.
It's time to go down in style.

876
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,040
I hear there's a new hero
who dares challenge my evil.

877
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,880
Where is the one they call Titan?

878
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,720
Challenge me if you dare!

879
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,080
Oh no. We're gonna crash!

880
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,640
This is embarrassing.

881
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,480
Of all the inconsiderate,
bone-headed...

882
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,560
...irresponsible, rude...

883
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,240
Unprofessional, that's what this is!

884
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,640
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

885
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,840
Of course not! He was a pro!

886
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,920
Hey, Megamind!
You're actually the guy I want to see.

887
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,440
Also, there's a door here.

888
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,400
Do you have any idea
how Iong I waited for you?

889
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,920
No, no, no, I totally understand
what you're saying.

890
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,400
Could you just, just shut up for one
second. I'm trying to beat this Ievel.

891
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,920
Were you even planning
on showing up?

892
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,240
What's this?

893
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,200
Where did you get all this stuff?

894
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,960
It doesn't belong to me.

895
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,040
- You stole it?
- Pretty cool, right?

896
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,560
- No, no, no, no! You're a hero!
- Being a hero is for Iosers!

897
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,600
It's work, work, work,
24/7, and for what?

898
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,920
I only took the gig to get the girl,

899
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,440
and it turns out Roxanne
doesn't want anything to do with me.

900
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,320
- Roxanne Ritchi?
- Yeah! Roxanne Ritchi!

901
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,880
I saw her having dinner
and making googly eyes

902
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,960
at some intellectual dweeb!

903
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,360
Who needs all that noise?

904
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,440
That's why I think we should team up.

905
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,400
You... Wait... What?

906
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,680
With my power,
and your big-headedness,

907
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,920
- we could rule the city!
- You want to team up?

908
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,720
I even drew up
some new costume designs, see?

909
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,160
- Costume designs?
- You'd be the brains,

910
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,680
so you'd get a Iittle brain,

911
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,320
wearing glasses on your costume,
or something.

912
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,480
And since I'm the cool one,
I'd have, Iike,

913
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,040
two tanks swordfighting...

914
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,440
I can't believe you.

915
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,240
AII your gifts, all your powers,

916
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,000
and you... you squander them
for your own personal gain.

917
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,080
- Yes!
- No! I'm the villain!

918
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,280
You're the good guy!
I do something bad,

919
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,960
and you come and get me!
That's why I created you.

920
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,960
Yeah, right. You're nuts.
Space Dad told me...

921
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,360
Look, I'm your space dad!

922
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,000
You should be more Iike Metro Man.

923
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,920
- You tricked me?
- Oh, don't Iike that?

924
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,280
Well, there's more.

925
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,800
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

926
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,680
- No.
- And we were smooching up a storm!

927
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,000
When I get my hands on you,
I'm gonna...

928
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,840
Yes! Yes, I know!
Bring me to justice.

929
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,440
Oh God, how I've missed this.

930
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,400
And the hero strikes the first blow.

931
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,880
But evil returns with a backhand!

932
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,480
Yes!

933
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,920
Come out, you Iittle freak!

934
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,480
I want to see what that big brain
Iooks Iike on the pavement!

935
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,080
You fell for the oldest
evil trick in the book!

936
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,480
You Iittle blue twerp!

937
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,600
En garde!

938
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,640
Oh, now that's the spirit!

939
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,280
Parry! Thrust! Parry again!

940
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,680
Now it's time for some witty
back and forth banter!

941
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,680
You go first!

942
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,320
OK! Look, I'm not sure
where to go with that!

943
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,080
This one's for stealing
my girlfriend!

944
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,360
This one's for Space Dad making
a fool out of me!

945
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,440
And, Megamind, this one's
for Space Stepmom! You Iied to her!

946
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,960
Well done. I thought
that battle went really, really well.

947
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,120
- I mean, I have a few notes.
- Notes?

948
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,360
But they can wait.
You can take me to jail now.

949
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,320
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking
more Iike the morgue. You're dead!

950
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This isn't how you play the game.

951
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,800
Game over.

952
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,920
Brain-bots!

953
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,160
I'm calling time out!

954
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,000
Time out? Time out! Time out!

955
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,520
Brain-bots,
initiate the fail-safe.

956
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Guess what, Buster Brown?
It's made from copper.

957
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,800
You're powerless against it.

958
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,320
It's the very same metal used
to defeat... Metro Man?

959
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,040
You should stop comparing me
to Metro Man!

960
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,120
You can run, Megamind,
but you can't hide!

961
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,320
We're saved! We're saved!

962
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,960
What's your name, new hero?

963
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,360
- It's Titan.
- Thank you!

964
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,080
Thank you! Titan has freed us!

965
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:29,760
Oh, I wouldn't say "free."
More Iike under new management.

966
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,640
- What do you want?
- Titan's turned evil.

967
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,800
Congratulations. Another one of your
genius plans has backfired on you.

968
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,160
And why did my doorman Iet you up?

969
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,760
Carlos.

970
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,920
Please, Roxanne, no. No.
I need your help.

971
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,760
Why do you need my help?

972
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,320
Because you're
the smartest person I know.

973
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,160
But you can't hide here.

974
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,520
The copper should have worked.
Why didn't the copper work?

975
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,160
The copper worked
perfectly well Iast time.

976
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,200
Copper? You're not making any sense.

977
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,120
Look, if we don't find
Titan's weakness,

978
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,840
he'll destroy the whole city.

979
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,360
- OK, how can I help?
- We need to find answers.

980
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,200
You knew Metro Man best.
Did he have a hideout? A cave?

981
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:22,080
A solitary fortress of some kind?
Anything that would give us clues.

982
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,880
Well... there is one place I know.

983
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,120
You gave him these powers.
Can't you just take them away?

984
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,840
I can't. I Iost my diffuser gun
when I misplaced the invisible car.

985
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,840
The night you dumped me. Alone.
In the rain.

986
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,440
Did you ever Iook back?

987
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,800
- No!
- My giant blue head!

988
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,080
I guess we're here.

989
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,800
So, this is where he hid it.

990
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,360
After all these years.
My old shoolhouse.

991
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,920
You know, I think there's an apology
in order for the other night.

992
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,120
OK, that would be nice,
but make it quick.

993
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,240
We have much more
pressing matters to deal with.

994
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:15,800
Wow. I can't believe
he kept all this stuff.

995
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,640
I remember when he wore that.

996
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,280
- Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?
- Yes, of course. Right. Focused.

997
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,480
Hey. Come over and Iook at this.

998
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,720
What is it? What did you find?

999
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,840
Look.

1000
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,840
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1001
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,360
Yes, that's what happens
when water gets cold.

1002
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,680
No, what I'm saying is,
don't you think it's a Iittle odd

1003
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,040
that the ice hasn't melted yet?

1004
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,880
One of Iife's great mysteries.

1005
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,760
Hey.

1006
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,320
We now have confirmed reports.

1007
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,240
Titan, first thought to be
this city's new hero, has turned evil.

1008
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,280
The city has never seen
this level of destruction.

1009
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,400
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1010
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,400
- You're alive?
- You're alive.

1011
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,320
- I'm alive.
- But I, we...

1012
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,640
We saw your skeleton!
You were dead!

1013
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,760
Are you a ghost?

1014
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,240
There had better be
an amazing explanation for this.

1015
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,360
Speak, apparition.

1016
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,120
OK. OK, OK, OK.

1017
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,000
You both deserve the truth.

1018
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,400
It all started
back at the observatory.

1019
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,840
Roxanne was kidnapped.
I was gonna stop you.

1020
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,200
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1021
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,480
We were kind
of going through the motions.

1022
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,640
So... using my super-speed,

1023
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,040
I decided to go clear my head.

1024
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,520
Fire!

1025
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,880
Then I realized,

1026
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,960
we had done this same silly charade
our entire lives.

1027
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,600
I tried to get my mind off
how I was feeling,

1028
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,720
but I just felt stuck.

1029
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,760
I began to realize,
despite all my powers,

1030
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,400
each and every citizen of Metro
had something I didn't: a choice.

1031
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,480
Ever since I can remember, I've always
had to be what the city wanted me to be.

1032
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,840
But what about what I wanted to do?

1033
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,600
Then it suddenly hit me.

1034
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,480
I do have a choice.

1035
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,840
I can be whatever I want to be.

1036
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,400
No one said this hero thing had to be
a lifetime gig.

1037
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,640
You can't just quit, either.

1038
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,640
That's when I got the brilliant idea...
to fake my death.

1039
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Copper drains my powers.

1040
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,120
Your weakness is copper?

1041
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,080
Once your death ray hit,
I'd never felt so alive.

1042
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,360
So I borrowed a prop
from a nearby nursing school.

1043
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,880
Metro Man was finally dead.

1044
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,200
And Music Man was born!

1045
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,640
- Music Man?
- That way I could keep my Iogo.

1046
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,880
- 'Cause of wha...?
- Come again?

1047
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,560
I was finally free to get in touch
with my true power...

1048
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,120
...weaving Iyrical magic.

1049
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,520
Check this out.

1050
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,760
I have eyes that can see

1051
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,840
Right through lead...

1052
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,000
- You're horrible!
- Granted, you have talent.

1053
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,880
But there's a madman
out there destroying our... your city.

1054
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,080
How could you do this?!

1055
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,240
The people of this city relied on you,
and you deserted them!

1056
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,160
You Ieft us in the hands of him!

1057
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,720
- No offense.
- No, I'm with you.

1058
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,840
Look, we need your help.

1059
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,640
I'm sorry. I really am.

1060
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,320
I'm done.

1061
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,960
You know, Iittle buddy,
there's a yin for every yang.

1062
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,240
If there's bad,
good will rise up against it.

1063
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,720
It's taken me a Iong time
to find my calling.

1064
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,400
Now it's about time you find yours.

1065
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,520
Hey, who needs him?

1066
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,360
We can beat Titan ourselves.

1067
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,520
I say we go back to the evil Iair,
grab some ray guns,

1068
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,280
hold him sideways,
and just go all gangsta on him.

1069
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,480
We can't.

1070
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,440
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1071
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:34,640
I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day,
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1072
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,400
and I don't get the girl.

1073
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,440
I'm going home.

1074
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,880
Unless someone comes
to our aid soon, all may be lost.

1075
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,400
Thousands have already fled the city
in a mass exodus.

1076
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,520
Remaining citizens are warned
to stay indoors until further notice.

1077
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,720
Authorities have issued a warning

1078
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,240
to stay out of the downtown area
at all costs.

1079
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,760
Hal!

1080
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,160
Hal!

1081
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,120
Let me guess.
After seeing how awesome I am,

1082
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,640
you've finally come to your senses?
Well, I'm over you.

1083
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,000
- I've come to stop you, Hal.
- You? Oh, wow.

1084
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,160
OK, what are you gonna do,
report me to death?

1085
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,360
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1086
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,640
You and I, we worked together
for a Iong time. I know you.

1087
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,320
You don't know me.
You never took the time to know me.

1088
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,840
This is the first time
we've hung out socially,

1089
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,840
and it's when
I'm about to destroy the city!

1090
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,760
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1091
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,200
I want to talk to the guy
who Ioved being a cameraman,

1092
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,760
and eating dip, and being a nerd,

1093
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,000
and being not as scary
as the Tighten Hal.

1094
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,360
Too Iate!

1095
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,560
...interrupting our scheduled...

1096
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,520
...extraordinary events
taking place...

1097
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,480
Heat in the valley and...

1098
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,800
Megamind!

1099
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,720
You and I have
some unfinished business.

1100
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,480
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower.

1101
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,080
Oh, and just
so you don't get cold feet...

1102
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,160
Roxanne.

1103
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,960
Come on, Roxie, call for your hero
to come rescue you.

1104
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,840
Megamind, I don't even know
if you're listening, but if you are,

1105
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,240
you can't give up.

1106
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,760
The Megamind I knew
would never have run from a fight,

1107
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,480
even when he knew he had
absolutely no chance of winning.

1108
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,120
It was your best quality.

1109
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,360
You need to be that guy right now.

1110
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,720
The city needs you.

1111
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,920
I need you.

1112
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,160
Roxanne.

1113
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,680
You have one hour.

1114
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,200
Don't keep me waiting.

1115
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Warden! Warden! Listen to me!
You have to Iet me go!

1116
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,160
Tighten has to be stopped!

1117
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,760
Sorry, Megamind.
You still have 88 Iife sentences to go.

1118
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,080
Plenty of time to reflect
on what you've done.

1119
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,120
Did you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

1120
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,760
Here it is,
from the blackest part of my heart.

1121
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,480
I am sorry!

1122
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,800
Not buying it.

1123
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,920
I don't blame you.

1124
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,240
I've terrorized this city
countless times.

1125
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,000
Created a hero
who's turned out to be a villain.

1126
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,600
I Iied to Roxanne, and...

1127
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,560
...my best friend Minion,
I treated Iike dirt.

1128
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,080
Please don't make this city...

1129
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,600
...don't make Roxanne
pay for my wrongdoings.

1130
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,400
Apology accepted.

1131
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,280
Oh, Minion, you fantastic fish, you.

1132
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,400
What are we waiting for?
We'd better get going.

1133
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,760
You got me.

1134
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,720
- Good Iuck, fellas!
- We're gonna die!

1135
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,240
Wait, what?

1136
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:55,520
Hey, Metro losers.
This is Metro Tower.

1137
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,840
They say it's supposed to be
a symbol of our city's strength.

1138
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,080
But for me,
it's a reminder of the day

1139
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:06,640
this woman ferociously ripped
out my heart. And I hate reminders!

1140
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,240
Help!

1141
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,080
Please don't do this. I know
there's still good in you, Hal.

1142
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,720
You're so naive, Roxie.

1143
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,880
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

1144
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,160
You're Iiving a fantasy.

1145
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,560
There is no Easter Bunny,
there is no Tooth Fairy,

1146
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,560
and there is no Queen of England.

1147
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,720
This is the real world,
and you need to wake up!

1148
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,720
You dare challenge Megamind?

1149
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,920
This town isn't big enough
for two super-villains!

1150
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:06,760
Oh, you're a villain all right!
Just not a super one!

1151
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:08,800
Yeah? What's the difference?

1152
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,240
Presentation!

1153
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,360
- I knew you'd come back.
- Well, that made one of us.

1154
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:08,600
- What's the plan?
- Well, it mostly involves not dying.

1155
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,000
I Iike that plan.

1156
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,360
Building!

1157
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,880
Go faster!
Make this thing go faster!

1158
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,720
I can't control it!

1159
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,400
No.

1160
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,880
Well, that was easy.

1161
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,360
Looks Iike there's
only one Ioose end now.

1162
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:13,760
Please, Iet's have a Iittle respect
for public transportation.

1163
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,920
You came back!

1164
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,200
You were right, Roxanne.
I never should have Ieft.

1165
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,680
I... I thought you were dead.

1166
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,080
My death was... greatly exaggerated.

1167
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,040
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1168
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,000
I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

1169
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,520
I'm so proud of you.

1170
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,760
Minion?

1171
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,440
Surprise!

1172
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,520
He's the real hero.

1173
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,720
Megamind.

1174
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,040
Going somewhere?

1175
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,080
Besides jail?

1176
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,080
No, not in the face, man. Please.

1177
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,680
If you know what's good for you,
Tighten, you'll stay out of Metrocity!

1178
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,280
- You got it!
- For good!

1179
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,400
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1180
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,720
But there's only one person I know
who calls this town "Metrocity."

1181
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,880
You.

1182
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
Bet you think it's really funny?

1183
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,800
Let's all Iaugh
at the really cool guy?

1184
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,760
Well, you're not gonna be Iaughing
for Iong.

1185
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:26,960
The invisible car.

1186
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,120
Hey! Remember that night
that I dumped you?

1187
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,640
You're bringing this up now?

1188
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,000
Well, I did Iook back!

1189
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,360
You did? You did?

1190
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,000
Yes! And you should Iook back
right now!

1191
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,920
Oh, I get it!

1192
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,360
This is the Iast time
you make a fool out of me!

1193
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,800
I made you a hero.

1194
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,040
You did the fool thing
all by yourself.

1195
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,840
You're so pathetic.

1196
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,600
No matter what side you're on,
you're always the Ioser.

1197
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,880
There's a benefit to Iosing.

1198
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,320
You get to Iearn from your mistakes.

1199
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,240
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1200
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,680
Minion, if I Iive, I will kill you.

1201
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,960
Enjoy your flight!

1202
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,600
Megamind!

1203
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,480
So this is how it ends.

1204
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,760
Normally, I'd chalk this up
to my last glorious failure.

1205
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,840
But not today.

1206
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,960
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.

1207
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,560
Say bye-bye, Roxie.

1208
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,280
OIIo.

1209
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,640
The thing about bad guys,
they always Iose!

1210
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,680
- You did it. You won.
- Well...

1211
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,280
I finally had a reason to win. You.

1212
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,520
Minion!

1213
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,800
Can't see. It's cold and... warm,
and dark and Iight.

1214
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,000
It's me, Minion. I'm right here.

1215
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,240
We've had a Iot of adventures together,
you and I.

1216
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,000
We have, Minion.

1217
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,800
I mean... most of them
ended in horrible failure,

1218
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,520
but we won today. Didn't we, sir?

1219
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:21,360
Yes, Minion, we did it.
Thanks to you.

1220
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,800
Code: We're The Good Guys Now.

1221
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,720
Code: I Guess We Are.

1222
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,960
Oh, oh, oh, I'm going!
I think this, this is it!

1223
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,080
I'm going... going far...

1224
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,960
What a drama queen.

1225
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:52,040
You know, I'm feeling much better now.
I guess I just needed a swim.

1226
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,760
He had you, didn't he?

1227
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,040
Classic Minion.
Don't give me that face.

1228
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,800
He reels you in with that Iittle face.

1229
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,800
- Look at that face.
- We did it!

1230
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,600
We did it!

1231
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,480
- Fist pump!
- You did it!

1232
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,200
We won, we won, we won!

1233
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,240
Get back, you savages!

1234
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,560
Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used
to positive feedback.

1235
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,640
Funny, I guess destiny is
not the path given to us...

1236
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,600
...but the path
we choose for ourselves.

1237
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,080
AII right, put your hands in the air.

1238
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,840
Now hand over your wallets.

1239
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,760
I'm just kidding!

1240
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,000
Just kidding!

1241
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,400
I have to admit,
being good has its perks.

1242
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,360
You know, you Iook
pretty good in white.

1243
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,760
Megamind, if you plea...

1244
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,080
Hey. My kid can't see.

1245
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,120
Sorry, my friend.

1246
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,080
Way to go, Iittle buddy.
I knew he had it in him.

1247
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

1248
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,440
Megamind, defender of Metro City!

1249
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,520
You know,
I like the sound of that.

1250
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:23,960
Hit it!

1251
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,120
Megamind! Megamind!
Megamind! Megamind!

1252
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,040
I'm bad! I'm bad! That's right. Yeah!

1253
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,640
Sir, you really need to empty
your pockets more often.

1254
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,080
This has been the worst day
of my entire Iife.

1255
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,760
No worries.
