1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,534
<i>Mutation: it is the key to our evolution.</i>

2
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,374
<i>It has enabled us to evolve
into the dominant species on the planet.</i>

3
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:35,415
<i>It has enabled us to evolve
into the dominant species on the planet.</i>

4
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>This process normally takes
thousands and thousands of years.</i>

5
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:44,675
<i>But every few hundred millennia,
evolution leaps forward.</i>

6
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,443
Niagara Falls,

7
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,187
Niagara Falls,

8
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,526
up the Canadian Rockies,

9
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,660
and then it's only
a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

10
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,618
- Won't it kinda be cold?
- Well, that's the point, stupid.

11
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,785
Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure.

12
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,749
And when are you gonna do this?

13
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:49,964
I don't know.

14
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,549
I don't know.

15
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,053
After high school. Before college.

16
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,425
- Marie!
- I don't know what happened.

17
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,471
- David?
- I don't know... I just touched him.

18
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,561
- I didn't mean...
- Call an ambulance!

19
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,602
We only touched. Just get away from me!

20
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,113
- Will you call an ambulance?!
- Don't touch me!

21
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:02,113
We are now seeing the beginnings
of another stage of human evolution.

22
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,786
These mutations manifest at puberty, often
triggered by periods of emotional stress.

23
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,251
Thank you, Miss Grey.
It was quite educational.

24
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,714
However, it fails to address the issue
that is the focus of this hearing.

25
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,426
Three words: are mutants dangerous?

26
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:19,592
Three words: are mutants dangerous?

27
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:25,477
That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong
person driving a car can be dangerous.

28
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,265
- We do license people to drive.
- Yes, but not to live.

29
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:35,146
Senator, mutants who've come forward
and revealed themselves publicly

30
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,816
have been met with fear,
hostility, even violence.

31
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,110
It is because of that hostility

32
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:41,450
It is because of that hostility

33
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,786
that I am urging the Senate
to vote against mutant registration.

34
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,292
- To force mutants to expose themselves...
- Expose themselves?

35
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:54,127
What do mutants have to hide that makes
them so afraid to identify themselves?

36
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,917
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.

37
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,464
- I didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.

38
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,756
I have here a list of names
of identified mutants...

39
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,345
...living right here in the United States.

40
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,262
- Senator Kelly...
- A girl in Illinois who walks through walls.

41
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,979
What's to stop her from walking
into a bank vault? Or into the White House?

42
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:18,489
Or into <i>their</i> houses? And there are even
rumours of mutants so powerful

43
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,776
that they can enter our minds
and control our thoughts,

44
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,659
taking away our God-given free will.

45
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,369
Taking away our God-given free will.

46
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:29,203
The American people deserve the right
to decide whether they want their children

47
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,371
to be in school with mutants.
To be taught by mutants.

48
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,544
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth is that mutants are very real.

49
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,419
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth is that mutants are very real.

50
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:46,217
And they are among us.
We must know who they are,

51
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:50,388
and, above all,
we must know what they can do.

52
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,296
Eric.

53
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,671
What are you doing here?

54
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:25,055
Why do you ask questions to which
you already know the answers?

55
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:25,884
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?

56
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,510
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?

57
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,055
I've heard these arguments before.

58
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,351
It was a long time ago.
Mankind has evolved since then.

59
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,071
Yes... into us.

60
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:53,166
Are you sneaking around in here, Charles?
Whatever are you looking for?

61
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,462
I'm looking for hope.

62
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:08,890
I will bring you hope, old friend.
And I ask only one thing in return.

63
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,428
Don't get in my way.

64
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,319
We are the future, Charles, not them!
They no longer matter.

65
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,586
This is it.

66
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,841
Where are we? I thought you said you were
gonna take me as far as Laughlin City.

67
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,100
This <i>is</i> Laughlin City.

68
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,345
Gentlemen, in all my years
I've never seen anything like this.

69
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,341
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

70
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,513
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

71
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,973
No!

72
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,889
I'll fight him!

73
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,356
Ladies and gentlemen,

74
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,486
our saviour!

75
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,153
Don't hit him in the balls.

76
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,741
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

77
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,383
You idiot!

78
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:26,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's winner and still King of the Cage,

79
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,647
the Wolverine.

80
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:02,560
You want something new, honey?
Or are you sticking with water?

81
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,616
I'll have a beer.

82
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,338
<i>Ellis Island, once the arrival point
for American immigrants,</i>

83
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,591
<i>is opening its doors again.</i>

84
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,799
<i>Preparations are nearly completed
for the United Nations World Summit.</i>

85
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:38,843
<i>The event promises to be the largest
single gathering of world leaders in history.</i>

86
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,684
<i>The event promises to be the largest
single gathering of world leaders in history.</i>

87
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:46,270
<i>Leaders will discuss issues ranging from
the world's economy and weapons treaties,</i>

88
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,858
<i>to the mutant phenomenon
and its impact on our world stage.</i>

89
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,695
<i>American legislators contend
that debate over mutant issues</i>

90
00:12:54,857 --> 00:13:00,284
<i>should be the primary focus of what is,
on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair.</i>

91
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,371
- You owe me some money.
- Stu, let's not do this.

92
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,334
No man takes a beating like that
without a mark to show for it.

93
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,841
- Come on, this isn't worth it.
- I know what you are.

94
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,881
You lost your money.
You keep this up, you lose something else.

95
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,515
Look out!

96
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,405
Get outta my bar, freak!

97
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:27,643
- What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.

98
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,306
- I thought you might help me.
- Get out!

99
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,354
- Where am I supposed to go?
- I don't know.

100
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,771
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.

101
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,743
- I saved your life!
- No, you didn't.

102
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,128
You don't have anything to eat, do you?

103
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,702
I'm Rogue.

104
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,086
Were you in the army?
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?

105
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,262
- Wow!
- What?

106
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,847
- Suddenly <i>my</i> life isn't bad.
- If you prefer the road...

107
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,761
No! It looks great.

108
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,355
No! It looks great.

109
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,145
It looks cosy.

110
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,946
Put your hands on the heater.

111
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,371
- I'm not gonna hurt you, kid.
- It's nothing personal.

112
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,879
It's just when people touch my skin,
something happens.

113
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,789
What?

114
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,630
I don't know. They just get hurt.

115
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,221
Fair enough.

116
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,303
When they come out, does it hurt?

117
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,017
Every time.

118
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,064
So what kind of a name is Rogue?

119
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,615
I don't know.
What kind of a name is Wolverine?

120
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:54,998
My name's Logan.

121
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,959
My name's Logan.

122
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,625
Marie.

123
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,795
- You should wear your seat belt.
- Look, kid, I don't need advice on...

124
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,409
You all right?

125
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,700
- Kid, are you all right?
- I'm stuck!

126
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,726
Weren't you supposed to bring
someone back with you?

127
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,521
Weren't you supposed to bring
someone back with you?

128
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,160
- What happened?
- They knew.

129
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,921
Charles...

130
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,393
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.

131
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,566
I have made the first move.
That is all they know.

132
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,531
Come, the UN summit is approaching.
Time for our little test.

133
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,984
Where's he going?

134
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,715
Where are you going?

135
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,774
Over here!

136
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:22,511
- Where are you going?
- This way!

137
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,718
He's over there.

138
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,348
Let go! What's your hurry?

139
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,571
Over here!

140
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,249
Good morning, Logan.

141
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,217
So, I'd like your definitions of weak and
strong anthropic principles on Wednesday.

142
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,427
That'll be all.

143
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,269
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

144
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,863
Physics.

145
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:26,401
I'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?

146
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,286
- Where am I?
- Westchester, New York.

147
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,204
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

148
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,496
- I don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

149
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,588
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue's here. She's fine.

150
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,969
Really?

151
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,301
Ah. Logan, I'd like you to meet
Ororo Monroe, also called Storm.

152
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,562
This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.

153
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,059
They saved your life.

154
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,897
I believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey.

155
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:10,161
You're in my school for the gifted. For
mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.

156
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,414
- What's a magneto?
- A very powerful mutant,

157
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,247
who believes a war is brewing
between mutants and the rest of humanity.

158
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,128
I've been following his activities
for some time.

159
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:20,879
The man who attacked you
is an associate of his called Sabretooth.

160
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,841
The man who attacked you
is an associate of his called Sabretooth.

161
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,717
Sabretooth?

162
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,422
Storm.

163
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,263
What do they call you? Wheels?

164
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,355
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

165
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,519
And Cyclops, right?

166
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:45,153
You wanna get outta my way?

167
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,491
Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it?

168
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,449
Living from day to day,
moving from place to place,

169
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,365
with no memory of who or what you are.

170
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,876
Shut up!

171
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:04,131
Give me a chance. I may be able
to help you find some answers.

172
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,836
- How do you know?
- You're not the only one with gifts.

173
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,300
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?

174
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,431
Over here!

175
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,392
What is this place?

176
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,101
Anonymity is a mutant's first defence
against the world's hostility.

177
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,149
Anonymity is a mutant's first defence
against the world's hostility.

178
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,359
He)', no powers!

179
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:33,574
To the public, we're merely
a school for gifted youngsters.

180
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,581
Cyclops, Storm and Jean
were some of my first students.

181
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,539
I protected them,
taught them to control their powers

182
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:45,297
and, in time, teach others to do the same.

183
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,794
The students are mostly runaways -
frightened, alone.

184
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,887
Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger
to themselves and those around them.

185
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,721
Like your friend Rogue.

186
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:01,606
Incapable of physical human contact,
probably for the rest of her life.

187
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:06,894
And yet here she is with others
her own age, learning, being accepted,

188
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,108
not feared.

189
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,042
- John!
- Sorry.

190
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,380
I'm Bobby.

191
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,464
I'm Bobby.

192
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,877
- What's your name?
- Rogue.

193
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,887
- What'll happen to her?
- That's up to her.

194
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:38,051
Rejoin the world as an educated
young woman, or stay on to teach others.

195
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,972
To become what the children
have affectionately called "X-Men".

196
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,435
Welcome to Mutant High.

197
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,653
But the school is merely our public face.

198
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:54,442
The lower levels, however,
are an entirely different matter.

199
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:02,500
When I was a boy I discovered I had
the power to control people's minds.

200
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,286
Make them think or do whatever I wanted.

201
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:09,502
When I was 17
I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

202
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:15,422
He, too, had an unusual power. He could
create magnetic fields and control metal.

203
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:21,594
Believing that humanity would never
accept us, he grew angry and vengeful.

204
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,814
He became Magneto.

205
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,360
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan.

206
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:30,610
And many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

207
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,902
And many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

208
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:38,194
If no one is equipped to oppose them,
humanity's days could be over.

209
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,533
I'll make a deal with you.

210
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:44,701
Give me 48 hours to find out
what Magneto wants with you,

211
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,710
and I give you my word
that I will use all my power

212
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:53,091
to help you piece together what you've lost,
and what you're looking for.

213
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,875
Senator, you favour gun registration, yes?
Some of these so-called children

214
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:30,914
possess more than 10 times
the destructive force of any handgun.

215
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,832
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.

216
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,254
No, I don't see a difference.
All I see are weapons in our schools.

217
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,261
Well, that's fair enough. All right.

218
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,263
So?

219
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,972
It's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.

220
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,263
What about the UN summit?
The world will be watching.

221
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,775
- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.
- We're Americans, Henry.

222
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,563
Let the rest of the damn world
deal with mutants in their own way.

223
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,903
You know this situation? These mutants?

224
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:05,615
People like this Jean Grey?
if it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away.

225
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,452
It's a war.

226
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,747
It's the reason people like me exist.

227
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,343
Where the hell are we?

228
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,230
Pilot!

229
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,066
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.

230
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:41,784
People like you are the reason
I was afraid to go to school as a child.

231
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,192
I'm sorry.

232
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,070
- For what?
- If I hurt you.

233
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,535
So... couldn't wait
to get my shirt off again, huh?

234
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:52,095
The metal is an alloy called adamantium.

235
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:57,894
Supposedly indestructible. It's been
surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

236
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,233
How could he have survived
a procedure like that?

237
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,697
His mutation. He has
uncharted regenerative capability

238
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,658
which enables him to heal rapidly.

239
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,199
This also makes his age
impossible to determine.

240
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:16,120
He could very well be older than you,
Professor.

241
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:19,085
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.

242
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,626
Nor does he remember anything
about his life before it happened.

243
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:27,389
Experimentation on mutants.
It's not unheard of.

244
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,219
But I've never seen anything
like this before.

245
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,762
What do you think Magneto want with him?

246
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,559
I'm not entirely sure it's him
Magneto wants.

247
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,177
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

248
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,383
Just like you.

249
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,930
Who are you people? Where's Henry?

250
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,817
Mr Guyrich has been dead
for some time, Senator.

251
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:24,697
But I've had Mystique here keep you
company. She takes so many shapes.

252
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,154
Whatever you do to me,
you'll make me right.

253
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:32,116
Every word I've spoken will be confirmed.

254
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:40,421
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?
It's such a strange phrase.

255
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,503
I've always thought of God as a teacher.

256
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,760
As a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

257
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,252
As a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

258
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,595
You see,
I think what you really are afraid of is me.

259
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,936
Me and my kind.
The brotherhood of mutants.

260
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:05,400
It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has
always feared what it doesn't understand.

261
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:12,362
Well, don't fear God, Senator,
and certainly don't fear me.

262
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,164
Not any more.

263
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,796
- What do you intend to do to me?
- Let's just say God works too slowly.

264
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,957
I think you'll be comfortable here.

265
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:45,041
- Where's your room?
- With Scott, down the hall.

266
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,128
Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy?

267
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,965
Actually I'm telekinetic.
I can move things with my mind.

268
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:53,253
Really? What kinds of things?

269
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,177
Really? What kinds of things?

270
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,055
All kinds of things.

271
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,434
- I also have telepathic ability.
- Like your professor?

272
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:08,602
Nowhere near that powerful.
But he's teaching me to develop it.

273
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,816
I'm sure he is.

274
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,658
- So read my mind.
- I'd rather not.

275
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:19,196
- Come on. You afraid you might like it?
- I doubt it.

276
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,804
What do you see?

277
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,768
Scott!

278
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,778
Good night, Logan.

279
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,455
You gonna tell me
to stay away from your girl?

280
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,538
If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.

281
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,830
Then I guess you've got nothing
to worry about, do you... Cyclops?

282
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:14,217
It must just burn you up
that a boy like me saved your life, huh?

283
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:18,005
You oughta be careful.
I might not be there next time.

284
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,766
Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl.

285
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,803
Logan?

286
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,686
Logan! Logan, wake up.

287
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,851
Help me!

288
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,769
Somebody, help!

289
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,714
Scott, grab a pillow.

290
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,719
It was an accident.

291
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,191
- Logan?
-Vvhathappened?

292
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,911
- Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

293
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,366
- What did she do to me?
- When Rogue touches someone,

294
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,285
she takes their energy, their life force.

295
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,831
In the case of mutants,
she absorbs their gifts for a while.

296
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,420
In your case, your ability to heal.

297
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,134
It felt like she almost killed me.

298
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,172
If she'd held out any longer,
she could have.

299
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,642
If she'd held out any longer,
she could have.

300
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,200
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, I hope.

301
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,928
What the hell have you done to me?

302
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:31,091
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?

303
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,635
Who would take you in,
now you're one of us?

304
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,821
Tommy, let it go! Tommy, please let it go!

305
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,740
I'm telling Mommy.

306
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,848
Is that a mutant?

307
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,392
<i>...UN summit. With the leaders
of over 200 nations attending,</i>

308
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:07,984
<i>the Secret Service has transformed
Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox</i>

309
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:13,744
<i>for tomorrow night's opening gala.
Ellis Island rests less than one mile from...</i>

310
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:15,911
Rogue!

311
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,405
Rogue!

312
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,666
Bobby!

313
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:25,046
Rogue, what did you do? They say
you're stealing other mutants' powers.

314
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,206
No! I borrowed his power.

315
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,173
You never use your power
against another mutant.

316
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,259
I had no choice.

317
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:39,804
- No, you have to understand...
- If I were you I'd get myself outta here.

318
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:45,730
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.

319
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:50,648
Professor Xavier's furious.
I don't know what he'll do with you.

320
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,819
I think it'll be easier on your own.

321
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,002
You should go.

322
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:30,399
What are you looking for, Eric? It's strange.

323
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:35,442
There are more powerful mutants out there.
Why should this one be so important to him?

324
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:39,158
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.

325
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,915
- How could you tell?
- Well, I am psychic, you know.

326
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,286
- Where is she?
- Who?

327
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,796
Rogue.

328
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,332
She's gone.

329
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,380
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

330
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,560
Welcome to Cerebro.

331
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,815
This certainly is a big, round room.

332
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:14,322
The brain waves of mutants
are different from average humans.

333
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,657
This device amplifies my power, allowing me
to locate mutants across great distances.

334
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,368
- That's how I intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?

335
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,411
- That's how I intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?

336
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:29,124
I've been trying, but he's found
some way to shield himself from it.

337
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,382
How would he know how to do that?

338
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,918
Because he helped me build it.

339
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,337
Now if you'll excuse me...

340
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,731
Have you ever...?

341
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,941
Used Cerebro?

342
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,152
No.

343
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:02,572
It takes a degree of control and...
for someone like me, it's...

344
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,239
Dangerous.

345
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,946
<i>...now boarding at track 4.</i>

346
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,872
- She's at the station.
- Where is it?

347
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,665
A few miles west of here.
You can't leave the mansion.

348
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,548
It's the opportunity Magneto needs.

349
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:00,382
- Listen, I'm the reason she took off.
- We had a deal.

350
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,297
She's all right. She's just upset.

351
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:07,844
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.

352
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:19,238
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?

353
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,144
Hey, kid.

354
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,703
I'm sorry about last night.

355
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,382
Me, too.

356
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,260
You running again?

357
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,301
I heard the professor was mad at me.

358
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,843
- Who told you that?
- A boy at school.

359
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,057
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

360
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,306
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

361
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,856
You look around,
I'll check with the ticket agent.

362
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,329
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

363
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:28,110
- You think I should go back.
- I think you should follow your instincts.

364
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,283
The first boy I ever kissed
ended up in a coma for three weeks.

365
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,377
The first boy I ever kissed
ended up in a coma for three weeks.

366
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,624
I can still feel him inside my head.

367
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,379
And it's the same with you.

368
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:19,411
There's not many people that'll understand
what you're going through.

369
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,751
But I think this guy Xavier's one of them.

370
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:27,468
He seems to genuinely wanna help you.

371
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,095
And that's a rare thing.

372
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,634
For people like us.

373
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,020
OK, so...

374
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:50,407
What do you say?
Give these geeks one more shot?

375
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,904
Come on, I'll take care of you.

376
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,583
- You promise?
- Yeah.

377
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,712
Yeah, I promise.

378
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,725
Come along now. I told you not to...

379
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:21,852
She's about 17, my height,

380
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,359
has brown hair and she...

381
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,116
Scream for me.

382
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,579
Quit playing around.

383
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,335
You must be Wolverine.

384
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:13,255
That remarkable metal doesn't run through
your entire body, does it?

385
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,346
Stop!

386
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,355
Stop it!

387
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:32,607
- What the hell do you want with me?
- You? My dear boy!

388
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,444
Whoever said I wanted you?

389
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,095
Young people!

390
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,567
<i>All right, hold it! Hold it right there.</i>

391
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:17,106
<i>Stay where you are.
Put your hands over your heads. Now!</i>

392
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,182
You Homo sapiens and your guns.

393
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,322
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.

394
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,864
Why not come out where I can see you,
Charles?

395
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,123
What do you want her for?

396
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:15,210
Can't you read my mind?

397
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,543
What now? Save the girl?

398
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,510
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

399
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:29,645
Let them pass that law and they'll have you
in chains with a number on your forehead.

400
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,398
- It won't be that way.
- Then kill me and find out.

401
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,154
No? Then release me.

402
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,161
Fine!

403
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,222
Care to press your luck, Charles?

404
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:11,645
I don't think I can stop them all.

405
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:32,499
Still unwilling to make sacrifices.
That's what makes you weak.

406
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,797
Goodbye, Charles.

407
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,255
- You said he wanted me.
- I made a terrible mistake.

408
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:25,261
His helmet was somehow designed
to block my telepathy.

409
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,844
Couldn't see what he was after
till it was too late.

410
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,054
- Where are you going?
- To find her.

411
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,265
- How?
- The traditional way: look.

412
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,360
- Logan, you can't do this alone.
- Who'll help me? You?

413
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,273
- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.
- Then help us. Fight with us.

414
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,283
Fight with you? Join the team?
Be an X-Man?

415
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:51,195
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

416
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,160
The world is full of people
that hate and fear you

417
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:59,249
and you're wasting your time trying
to protect them. I got better things to do.

418
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:01,163
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

419
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,915
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

420
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,927
- Are you sure you're on the right side?
- At least I've chosen a side.

421
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,267
I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.

422
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,324
Senator Kelly.

423
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,869
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.

424
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,829
I was afraid if I went to hospital,
they would...

425
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,993
Treat you like a mutant?

426
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,003
We're not what you think. Not all of us.

427
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,879
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.

428
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,393
Senator...

429
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,559
I want you to try and relax.

430
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,190
I'm not going to hurt you.

431
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,752
Welcome to the future.

432
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,172
Brother.

433
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,928
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.

434
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,095
But the mutation is unnatural.
Kelly's body is rejecting it.

435
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,687
- His cells began to break down immediately.
- What effect does it have on mutants?

436
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:31,197
There appears to be none. But I fear it will
harm any normal person exposed to it.

437
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:35,109
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- I don't know.

438
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:43,125
Wait a second. You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto.

439
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:48,835
- And that it weakened him.
- Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him.

440
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:54,841
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue
and use her to power the machine.

441
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,100
Is somebody there?

442
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,475
Yes. I'm here.

443
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,771
Please don't leave me!

444
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,859
I don't want to be alone.

445
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,950
All right.

446
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,662
Do you hate normal people?

447
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,841
Sometimes.

448
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,761
Why?

449
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,558
Isupposeu.

450
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,179
I'm afraid of them.

451
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:49,475
Well...

452
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:55,364
I think you've got one less person...
to be afraid of.

453
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:22,925
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.

454
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,015
Wait a minute.
He's not coming with us, is he?

455
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,727
- Yes.
- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...

456
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,938
I wasn't the one who gave the station
a new sunroof, pal.

457
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,900
No, you were the one
who stabbed Rogue in the chest.

458
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,157
Why don't you take your little mission
and stick it up...

459
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,694
Senator Kelly is dead.

460
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,530
I'm going to find her.

461
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,534
Settle this.

462
01:04:27,322 --> 01:04:29,416
I'm sorry.

463
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,610
You can still hear me... can't you?

464
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:09,323
You've taught me everything in my life
that was ever worth knowing.

465
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,992
And if anything happens...

466
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,204
I'll take care of them.

467
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,637
Jean?

468
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,434
Jean!

469
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,819
No!

470
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,367
Jean?

471
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,582
Jean.

472
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,792
Answer me. Please.

473
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,251
I know where Magnet0's going.

474
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,165
Magnificent, isn't she?

475
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,043
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1949.

476
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,341
- I've seen it.
- I first saw her in 1949.

477
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:35,765
America was going to be
the land of tolerance. Of peace.

478
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,351
Are you going to kill me?

479
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,653
Yes.

480
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,741
- Why?
- Because there is no land of tolerance.

481
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,703
There is no peace, not here
or anywhere else.

482
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,502
Whole families destroyed simply

483
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,505
because they were born different
from those in power.

484
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:09,795
Well, after tonight,
the world's powerful will be just like us.

485
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,589
They will return home as brothers.

486
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:15,179
As mutants.

487
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,719
Our cause will be theirs.

488
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,898
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.

489
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,857
I'll understand
if that comes as small consolation.

490
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,736
Put her in the machine.

491
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,623
I'll raise it.

492
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,376
Magneto is here - Liberty Island.

493
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:48,383
Presumably his objective is to mutate the
world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island.

494
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,762
He doesn't know his machine kills,
and judging from what the professor saw

495
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,643
if Magneto gave Rogue enough power, he
could wipe out everyone in New York City.

496
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,396
All right. We can insert here
at the George Washington Bridge.

497
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,978
Come around the bank,
just off of Manhattan,

498
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,690
land on the far side of Liberty Island. Here.

499
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,980
What about harbour patrol? Radar?

500
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,867
If they have anything that can pick up
ourjet, they deserve to catch us.

501
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,422
You actually go outside in these things?

502
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,552
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?

503
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,217
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?

504
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,221
Whoa.

505
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,941
There's the bridge. I'm takin' her down.

506
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,774
Storm, some cover, please.

507
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:36,899
Storm, some cover, please.

508
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,631
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp.
We're not alone.

509
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,721
And you stay here.
Once I've given my power to the girl,

510
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,978
I'll be temporarily weakened.

511
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,605
You'll be my only defence.

512
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,652
Sounds like a storm's comin'.

513
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,545
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?

514
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,605
The torch.

515
01:11:56,312 --> 01:12:01,534
<i>...the proceedings. The first dignitaries
started to arrive about an hour ago,</i>

516
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:05,572
<i>greeted with a garden-party atmosphere
designed to entertain them</i>

517
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:08,287
<i>as the others traversed the rigid security.</i>

518
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,569
- There's someone here.
- Where?

519
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,448
- I don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan...

520
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,994
Damn it!

521
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:56,123
- Anything?
- There's someone here. I just can't see 'em.

522
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,353
Wait!

523
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,563
Back up! Back up!

524
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,898
Jean!

525
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:40,685
Oh, God!

526
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,789
Don't move.

527
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:02,100
Don't you people ever die?

528
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:39,854
Do you know what happens to a toad
when it's struck by lightning?

529
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:48,521
The same thing
that happens to everything else.

530
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,830
Logan, is that you?

531
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:20,182
The other one ain't far away.

532
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:24,645
- Come on. We have to regroup.
- I know, but there's a problem.

533
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,484
You're not part of the group.

534
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,670
Hey, hey! It's me.

535
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,214
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.

536
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,349
OK.

537
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,095
Hey!

538
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:24,617
- Everybody get out of here.
- What is it?

539
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,831
I can't move.

540
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,811
Ah, my brothers.

541
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:55,444
Welcome. And you, just point those claws
of yours in a safer direction.

542
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:11,547
You better close your eyes.

543
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,585
Storm, fry 'em.

544
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:21,053
A bolt of lightning into
a huge copper conductor.

545
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,014
I thought you lived at a school.

546
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:33,395
For those of you not familiar
with the historical significance...

547
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,034
Mystique?

548
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:44,531
- Mystique!
- I've seen Senator Kelly.

549
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:50,837
So, the good senator survived his fall.
And the swim to shore.

550
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:53,544
He's become even more powerful
than I imagined.

551
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:56,300
- He's dead.
- It's true.

552
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:00,508
I saw him die.
Like those people down there will die.

553
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:04,217
Are you sure you saw what you saw?

554
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:05,885
I would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America

555
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,637
I would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America

556
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:14,436
for hosting this event under the lights
of the great city of New York.

557
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:25,830
Why do none of you understand
what I'm trying to do?

558
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:31,370
Those people down there control our fate
and the fate of every other mutant!

559
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:35,089
Well...

560
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,750
soon our fate will be theirs.

561
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:41,136
<i>Help! Please help me!</i>

562
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:47,435
You're so full of shit. If you're really
so righteous, it'd be you in that thing.

563
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:53,057
Help! Somebody help me!

564
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,122
<i>Please!</i>

565
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,788
<i>Somebody please help me!</i>

566
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:20,801
Somebody! Help me...

567
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,268
Logan!

568
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,995
- I'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.

569
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,596
This is mine.

570
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,578
You owe me a scream.

571
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:59,919
Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet.

572
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:06,292
- Jean.
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.

573
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:07,459
- No!
- Trust me.

574
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:10,129
You drop something?

575
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,139
NQW!

576
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,322
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

577
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:37,574
- Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it?
- The rings are moving too fast.

578
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:40,492
- Shoot it!
- I'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up?

579
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,833
- I can't control it like that.
- Then let me go.

580
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:50,591
If I don't make it,
at least you can still blast the damn thing.

581
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:55,466
All right, do it!
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.

582
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:59,102
Hang on to something.

583
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,318
Scott, wait!

584
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:28,025
- Jean, I have to!
- Just wait!

585
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,438
I have a shot.

586
01:26:32,604 --> 01:26:34,447
I'm taking it.

587
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,233
Come on...

588
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:51,286
Hey, this one's alive.
Let's get him outta here.

589
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:21,235
Welcome back. I knew you'd find your way.

590
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:23,366
I had you to guide me.

591
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,031
How did we do?

592
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:59,148
Oh, that tickles.

593
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,405
<i>He'! -</i>

594
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,279
<i>He'! -</i>

595
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,443
How are you feeling?

596
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,658
Fantastic.

597
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,491
That was a brave thing you did.

598
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:16,457
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

599
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:23,469
She's fine. She took on a few of your
more charming personality traits for a while.

600
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,839
But we lived through it.

601
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:32,010
I think she's a little taken with you.

602
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:36,603
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

603
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,689
You know, you and I...

604
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,903
How's the professor?

605
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,029
He's good.

606
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:52,243
Good.

607
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:01,211
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies

608
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:05,503
close to where we found you.
There's not much left but...

609
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,138
you might find some answers.

610
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:14,306
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say goodbye to them?

611
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,979
<i>The Mutant Registration Act
lost its main proponent</i>

612
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,894
<i>with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly</i>

613
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:27,487
<i>who until now had provided the loudest
voice in the cry for mutant registration.</i>

614
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:33,531
<i>I was wrong in this particular issue and I
hope, in time, I may be forgiven. Thank you.</i>

615
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:36,701
<i>The Mutant Registration Act
continues to draw support...</i>

616
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,914
Mystique.

617
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,500
Son of a bitch.

618
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,042
Son of a bitch.

619
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,211
<i>...from many parents' rights groups who feel
threatened by unidentified mutants.</i>

620
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:49,588
<i>...from many parents' rights groups who feel
threatened by unidentified mutants.</i>

621
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,258
<i>In a related story, the body
of Senator Kelly's aide,</i>

622
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:56,269
<i>Henry Guyrich, was found today.</i>

623
01:31:56,428 --> 01:32:01,730
<i>Preliminary coroner's reports seem to
indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear.</i>

624
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,477
Hey!

625
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,569
- You running again?
- Not really.

626
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:16,373
I have some things to take care of up north.

627
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:24,001
I kinda like it.

628
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,462
I don't want you to go.

629
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:44,726
I'll be back for this.

630
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,228
I'll be back for this.

631
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:26,643
Doesn't it ever wake you in the night,

632
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:31,782
the feeling that someday they will pass
that foolish law, or one just like it,

633
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,034
and come for you?

634
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,445
And your children?

635
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:42,284
It does indeed.

636
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:47,956
What do you do when you wake up to that?

637
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,799
What do you do when you wake up to that?

638
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:56,762
I feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who
comes to that school looking for trouble.

639
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:07,479
Why do you come here, Charles?

640
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:11,067
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers?

641
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:15,530
Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope.

642
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:30,048
You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me for ever.

643
01:34:30,206 --> 01:34:34,837
The war is still coming, Charles,
and I intend to fight it.

644
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:38,514
By any means necessary.

645
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:41,802
And I will always be there.

646
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:45,889
Old friend.
