1
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:43,724
I want mead.
Give me some mead, my queen.

2
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:53,232
Thank you, my beautiful queen.

3
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:05,159
This is how it works, Aesher.
After you die, you wouldn't really be dead.

4
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:12,124
Providing you accepted Him as
the one and only god.

5
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,879
Back, back!

6
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:32,684
Faster, faster, faster!

7
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:49,116
I wanna a kiss. Give me a kiss.
I wanna kiss you. - Stop it!

8
00:02:55,955 --> 00:03:02,002
My fays, my beautiful fays.
One year ago, I, Hrothgar your king,

9
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:10,636
swore that we would celebrate our victories
in a new hall. Mighty and beautifull.

10
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,970
Why not?

11
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:18,058
And in this hall we shall
divide the spoils of our conquest,

12
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:26,399
the gold and the treasure. And this shall
be a place of merriment, joy and fornication.

13
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:37,034
From now until the end of time.
I name this hall... HERAT!

14
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:43,206
Treasure,
let's hand out some treasure.

15
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:52,631
From the conquest.
Unferth. For Unferth.

16
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,257
For Unferth.

17
00:03:54,841 --> 00:04:02,974
My wisest advisor, violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

18
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:10,690
Unferth! Where the hell are you, you weasel-faced bastard?
- I'm here my king.

19
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:16,361
Let me tell you, you ungrateful lout!

20
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:33,167
Hrothgar!  Hrothgar!
Hrothgar!  Hrothgar...

21
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:37,046
<i>He faced the demon dragon.
Where other men would freeze.</i>

22
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:41,258
<i>And then, my God, he took his sword.
And brought it to his knees.</i>

23
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:43,176
<i>Hrothgar!  Hrothgar...</i>

24
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:47,097
<i>The greatest of our kings!
Hrothgar!  Hrothgar!</i>

25
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:50,850
<i>He broke the dragon's wings.
Hrothgar!  Hrothgar!</i>

26
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:57,272
<i>The kingdom fell in darkness,
and shadows rule the light...</i>

27
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:01,234
<i>By the sign of dawn, he soldier on,
And brought us back to life.</i>

28
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:04,821
<i>Hrothgar!  Hrothgar...</i>

29
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:32,399
Mead! Mead!

30
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:42,825
You're spilling. Where's my mead?
You're spilling! You're spilling!

31
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:50,124
Idiot.
How dare you waste king's mead.

32
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:04,887
<i>He rode up like a saviour, when every hope is gone,
the beast was gone, the deed was done,</i>

33
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:11,769
<i>His men may live on,
Let every cup be raised...</i>

34
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:38,514
A sword. Give me a sword!

35
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:08,248
Sword! Sword!

36
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:21,355
Fight me!
Fight me!

37
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:26,611
Fight me!

38
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,484
Fight me, damn you.

39
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:09,369
What was... that?
-Grendel.

40
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:26,718
Grendel, What have you done?
What have you done, Grendel?

41
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,387
Moth-er?

42
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:41,606
Fish, and wolf, and bear,
and sheep or two. But not men.

43
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:49,906
Men... they hurt us.

44
00:12:55,035 --> 00:13:00,998
Men, Grendel.
They have slain so many of our kind.

45
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:27,773
Man hurt me, hurt me...

46
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:38,700
Was Hrothgar there?

47
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:46,289
Me hurt him not!...

48
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,332
Good.

49
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:54,213
Good boy. Tender.

50
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:57,632
Mother.

51
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,937
Men, build another pyre.
There's dry wood behind the stables.

52
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:18,401
Then burn the dead, and seal the hall.
Close the doors and the windows.

53
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:23,406
And by the king's order, there shall be
no singing or marrymaking of any kind.

54
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,452
This place reeks of death.

55
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:33,456
The scops are singing the shame of Herot
as far south as the middle kingdom,

56
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,459
And as far North as the Iceland.

57
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:40,964
I have let it be known that I will give
half the gold in my kingdom to any man

58
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,299
who can rid us of Grendel.
-My king, for deliverance our people

59
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:49,721
sacrifice goats and sheep to Odin and Heimdall.
With your permision

60
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:55,685
shall we also pray to the new Roman God,
Christ Jesus?

61
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,270
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

62
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:06,194
No, Unferth, no. All the Gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

63
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:18,288
What we need is a hero.

64
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:17,247
Hold on up!

65
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,841
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Dane's guide-fire?

66
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,217
I see nothing but the wind and the rain.

67
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:38,641
No fire? No stars by which to navigate?
We're lost! Given to the sea!

68
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:43,603
The sea is my mother! She'll
never take me back into her murky womb!

69
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:59,158
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.
I was rather hoping to die in battle, as a warrior should.

70
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:09,334
The men are worried.
The storm has no end, Beowulf...

71
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:16,049
It's no earthly storm!  That much is for sure.
But this demon's tempest will not hold us out.

72
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:20,803
if we really want IN!

73
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:26,725
Who wants to live!?
Then pull your oars!

74
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:33,939
Let's see you do it!
For Beowulf! For gold! For glory!

75
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:03,676
Heave! Heave!
Heave!

76
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:15,353
Beowulf!

77
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,771
Hold up.

78
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,107
No.

79
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:43,252
Who are you? From your dress, you are warriors.
Speak! Why should I not run you through right now!

80
00:17:43,377 --> 00:17:49,007
We are Geats.
I am Beowulf, son of Edgethow.

81
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:54,054
We've come seeking your prince, Hrothgar,
in friendship.

82
00:17:54,596 --> 00:18:00,058
They say you have a monster here.
They say your lands are cursed.

83
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:05,314
Is that what they say? -Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame
from the frozen North to the shores of Finland.

84
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:09,025
It is no shame to be accursed by demons.
- I'm Beowulf!

85
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,028
And I'm here to kill your monster.

86
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,201
I thought there are no more heroes
foolish enough to come around here

87
00:18:18,618 --> 00:18:19,701
and die for our gold.

88
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:25,039
If we die, it'll be for glory,
not for gold.

89
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:37,717
My Lord!

90
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:43,931
My Lord, there are warriors outside.
Geats. But there are no beggars.

91
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,268
and their leader, Beowulf, is a...
-Beowulf? Edgethow's little boy?

92
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:55,067
Beowulf, where is he? Where...
Ah, there you are. Beowulf! Welcome my boy. Welcome.

93
00:18:57,193 --> 00:19:02,948
How is your father?
-Dead. Died in battle with sea-raiders, two winters' back.

94
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:07,578
He was a brave man. May I ask why
you have come to us from across the sea?

95
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:13,791
I come to kill your monster,
and to taste that famous mead of yours.

96
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:18,380
There have been many brave men,
who have come to taste my lord's mead.

97
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,926
And many who had sworn to rid
his hall of our nightmare.

98
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:30,224
but in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them,

99
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:36,687
but blood to be cleaned from the floor...
and the benches... and the walls.

100
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:49,448
I have drunk nothing. Yet.
But I will kill your monster.

101
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,371
He will kill the monster! Did you hear that?
Grendel will die!

102
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,873
Grendel?
-The monster is called Grendel.

103
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:07,424
Then I will kill your Grendel.
I, Beowulf, killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys.

104
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:15,889
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents.
And this... this troll of yours will trouble you no more.

105
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,393
A hero! A hero!
I knew that the sea would bring us a hero!

106
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:25,105
So, will you go up to the moors,
to dark pool by the cave and kill the monster in its den?

107
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:31,362
I have fourteen brave Thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

108
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:37,491
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead,

109
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,748
famed across the world,
and to feast in your legendary mead-hall.

110
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:47,709
The mead-hall has been sealed
by his lord's order.

111
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:52,088
Marrymaking in the hall brings
the devil, Grendel.

112
00:20:55,509 --> 00:21:00,345
Well then?
- Open the mead-hall, let's drink!

113
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,094
We don't want any
trouble with the locals.

114
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:49,181
Hondshew. Make me feel you're
pretending to listen to me.

115
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,227
It's only been five days since you
waved your wife goodbye.

116
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:57,146
Five days? In the name of Odin!
No wonder my loins are burning.

117
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:07,365
Beowulf, there you are. I was thinking
about your father, great man.

118
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:11,826
He was fleeing the Wylflings.
And he'd killed one of them with his bare hands.

119
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,537
Heatholaf?
- That's it, yes, aye.

120
00:22:15,163 --> 00:22:19,542
I paid the blood-debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

121
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:25,630
So, I saved his skin,
and you are yet to save ours, eh?

122
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:39,309
All hail the great Beowulf!
Come to save our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

123
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:49,110
And we are so damn grateful, mighty Beowulf.
But, can I ask a question,

124
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,278
as a huge admirer of yours?

125
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,871
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of,

126
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:07,335
who challenged Brecca The Mighty
to a swimming race, out on the open sea.

127
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,297
Was that you?
- I swam against Brecca.

128
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:16,009
Oh?

129
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,889
Because, I thought, it had to be
a different Beowulf.

130
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:26,894
Someone else of the same name.
Because, you see,

131
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:32,733
the Beowulf I heard of
swam against Brecca, and lost.

132
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:41,700
He risked his life, and Brecca's,
to serve his own vanity and pride.

133
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,703
A boastful fool.
AND HE LOST!

134
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:52,500
So,
I thought it had to be someone else...

135
00:23:54,961 --> 00:24:02,509
I swam against Brecca..
- But victory was his, not yours.

136
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:08,724
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match !

137
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:11,600
Speaking only for myself here,

138
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,147
Not only do I doubt that you will be able to
stand for a moment

139
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:22,027
against Grendel,
I doubt that you will even have the belly

140
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:24,987
to stay in the hall all night.

141
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:32,745
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

142
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:38,791
But it's true, I did not win the race...

143
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:45,090
We swam for five days, neck and neck.

144
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:51,803
I was conserving my strength,
for the final stretch... when this storm blew up,

145
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:56,058
and with it came sea monsters.

146
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:12,989
Again and again
the monsters attacked,

147
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:17,743
dark things
from the sea's depths.

148
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:30,589
I hacked and I scratched at these fowl beasts
with my sword,

149
00:25:31,006 --> 00:25:33,592
spilling their guts into the sea.

150
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:48,437
Beowulf!!

151
00:25:54,777 --> 00:26:00,532
Then, one of them ceased me
by its jaws,

152
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:06,621
and dragged me to the bottom...

153
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:42,319
I killed the moster with my own blade and...
I plunged it into its heart.

154
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:51,577
Yes, of course. The "sea monsters"...
And you killed, what was it... twenty?

155
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,080
Nine.

156
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:56,958
Last time it was three.

157
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:01,044
But... would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

158
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:12,555
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.
- Unferth, son of Ecglaf?

159
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:15,933
I know who you are.

160
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:21,897
They say you killed both
of your brothers when you witness them

161
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,482
having knowledge of your mother.

162
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:29,862
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kin-Slayer.

163
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:34,367
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

164
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:38,161
Grendel would not feel free to
murder and gorge on your people,

165
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:42,498
without fear of retaliation.
Tonight will be different!

166
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:47,796
Tonight he will find Geats waiting for him.
Not frightened sheep.

167
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:56,470
Like you.

168
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:08,564
Well done! That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

169
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:13,234
So, you'll kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

170
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:21,326
Let's all drink, in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

171
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:38,590
<i>"Lips ripe as the berries in June,
Red the rose, red the rose..."</i>

172
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:46,515
<i>"Skin pale as the light of the moon,
gently as she goes..."</i>

173
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:55,355
<i>"Eyes blue as the sea and the sky..." -
Beowulf, come. - "Waterfall, waterfall..."</i>

174
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:59,735
Come with me, I want to show you something.
- "Heart, burning like a fire in the night..."

175
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:03,905
<i>"gently as she goes..."</i>

176
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:09,244
Come!

177
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:24,549
There. Royal dragon horn.
- It is beautiful.

178
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:29,052
Isn’t it magnificent?
She's the prize of my treasure.

179
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:33,974
I claimed her after my battle with the Farmir,
The dragon of the Northern moors.

180
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:39,061
Nearly cost me my life.
And there's a soft spot under the

181
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:46,611
throat, there. See?
You have to go in with a knife or a dagger.

182
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,490
That's the only way to kill a dragon.

183
00:29:53,032 --> 00:29:58,413
I wonder how many men have died for love of her beauty?

184
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,415
Can you blame them?

185
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:07,837
If you destroy my Grendel for me,
she’ll be yours forever,

186
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:12,092
and ever, and ever...

187
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:18,680
You do me great honor.
- It is we who are honored.

188
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,372
Is that your demon?
- That was a wolf. You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

189
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:52,085
No, well, he'll hear me, I promise.
Come on, my mighty lust limb can transport you to paradise.

190
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:57,049
To ecstasy and back. No other man will
ever be able to satisfy you again.

191
00:30:57,132 --> 00:31:00,802
- Sorry. - Oh, come on.
- I said no, and I meant no.

192
00:31:00,969 --> 00:31:05,138
Why not? - Because it's late and its dark and the
monster could arive at any moment.

193
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,099
Well, then...
how about a quick gobble?

194
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:20,528
The hour is upon us.
This old man needs his sleep.

195
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:28,785
Where's my beautiful bed-mate?
Come, my love. - In a moment.

196
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:35,875
Come on Wealthow. Let's pound the pillows.
- Don't touch me.

197
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,420
That's the spirit, my girl.
- My Lord.

198
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:57,687
Perhaps her majesty could grace our ears with
one more melody before we all retire?

199
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:03,983
That's the least I can do.

200
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:16,577
Beowulf, I hope to see you in the morning,
Whole and willing.

201
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,419
And make sure your Thanes secure the doors.
Good night, good night...

202
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:29,631
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea-monsters.

203
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:36,847
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

204
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:53,277
<i>Just wait, the wide he may roam,
Always a hero comes home...</i>

205
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:07,165
<i>He goes where no one has gone,
But always a hero comes home...</i>

206
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:41,445
<i>He goes where no one has gone,
But always a hero comes home...</i>

207
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,454
That was... beautiful.

208
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,552
You need to go now, your majesty.
- Of course. Grendel.

209
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:20,522
The demon is my husband’s shame.
- It's not a shame, it's a curse.

210
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:29,739
No, shame.  My husband has no other... no sons.

211
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,699
And he will have no more, for all his talk.

212
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:36,704
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?
- Nah. Not my type.

213
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:39,372
I know your type.
Baa! Baa!

214
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:49,424
Lord Beowulf... What are you doing?

215
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:56,388
The creature has no sword, no armor.
And I have no weapon capable of slaying a monster.

216
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,849
We shall fight as equals.

217
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:04,937
And... fate shall decide.

218
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,874
Tight up the door chain!

219
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,588
Stop freaking about!

220
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:47,309
You’re mad, you know that?
- Yes.

221
00:35:53,230 --> 00:36:01,572
Something affects you, my Wiglaf.
- I don't like the smell of this one, my lord.

222
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:07,076
The men are unprepared.
They're distracted.

223
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:13,541
There are too many untended women here!
Abstinent prior the battle is essential!

224
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:22,340
The warriors mind must be unblured, my lord.
- Good night, Wiglaf.

225
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:30,764
And while you're sleeping what are we meant to do?
- Sing, loudly!

226
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:39,440
Well, you heard him. He wants us to sing.
So sing. Olaf sing!

227
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:49,448
<i>There was a dozen virgins,
Friesians, Danes and Franks!</i>

228
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:53,826
<i>We took 'em for some swiving,
and all we got were wanks!</i>

229
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:58,749
<i>OOohh, We are Beowulf's army,
We are mighty Thanes...</i>

230
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,171
<i>The fattest of the Virgins,
I knew her for a whore!</i>

231
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:09,465
<i>I gave her all my codpiece,
And still she wanted more!</i>

232
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:12,970
<i>Her sister was from Norway,
She costs me twenty groats!</i>

233
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,472
<i>She showed me there was more ways
Than one to sow my oats!</i>

234
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:20,100
<i>Her father was from Iceland,
And she was mighty hot!</i>

235
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,979
<i>She'll need a whole damn iceberg,
To cool her burning twa...</i>

236
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:32,278
Grendel, he knocks.

237
00:37:33,946 --> 00:37:40,827
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa!
She's ready for me to taste her juicy fruit!

238
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:45,289
My lord.
- Patience. Patience, my love!

239
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:51,671
No, Hondshew! No!

240
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:05,766
This can't be.
It's a freaking monster.

241
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:57,950
I swear to my mother that this monster has no pintel!

242
00:40:39,947 --> 00:40:40,906
No pintel!

243
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:07,054
The demon shrinks.
It shrinks.

244
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:14,282
Your blood-letting days are finished,
demon!

245
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,619
I am not demon!

246
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:24,457
It speaks! It speaks!

247
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:33,965
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.
I am the teeth in the darkness

248
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:38,470
the talons in the night.
Mine is strength, and lust, and power.

249
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,556
I am Beowulf!!

250
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:11,415
Grendel's arm! You've done it!

251
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:18,506
He's done it!
He's torn the limbs from the beast!

252
00:43:18,756 --> 00:43:26,138
Beowulf has killed him! Hail Beowulf!
- Hail Beowulf! - Hail Beowulf!...

253
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:39,108
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon.
- Odin be praised.

254
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,237
Go tell the scops,
spread the word!

255
00:43:43,444 --> 00:43:44,820
Yes my Lord.

256
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:52,912
Tomorrow will be a glorious day of rejoicing.
A nightmare is over.

257
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,041
Come to bed, my sweet.

258
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,172
My kingdom need a heir,
I need a son!

259
00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:08,008
It's time you did your duty.
- How can I ever lay with you

260
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:10,051
knowing you laid with her?

261
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:19,311
I should never have told you.
I should never have told you.

262
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:46,960
Grendel... My son.
My poor son.

263
00:44:48,044 --> 00:44:54,676
Mother.
They harmed me mother.

264
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,430
Sleep now, my son.

265
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:07,854
He murdered me, mother.
- Who murdered you, my son?

266
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,318
He ripped off my arm.

267
00:45:16,153 --> 00:45:21,324
He will pay, my darling.
Who was the man?

268
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:29,499
He was so strong.
So strong.

269
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:40,050
Who was the man?
- Yes... yes.

270
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,138
His name was...

271
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:50,142
Beowulf.

272
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:04,947
Beowulf?

273
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,540
They were great warriors.

274
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:22,170
They died a fowl death.
- They were murdered by a fowl creature,

275
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:28,302
from the depths of hell.
The bards will sing of their glory forever.

276
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:40,479
Come, let's drink to their memory.
I want you to raise the first cup.

277
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:47,318
I am not in a mood for marrymaking.
I'll ride down to marine, to prepare the boat.

278
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:53,157
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide.
Do we not?

279
00:46:54,909 --> 00:46:56,160
Aye.

280
00:46:56,327 --> 00:47:00,496
My fays.
My friends, brothers,

281
00:47:01,914 --> 00:47:10,297
This place for me has been a hall of sadness,
and for all of us it has been a place of

282
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:16,678
misery bloodshead and death.
But today, monsters reign has ended.

283
00:47:17,012 --> 00:47:20,849
They said he ripped the monsters limb of
with his bare hands.

284
00:47:21,265 --> 00:47:26,521
I wonder if all his strength is only in his arms,
or his legs as well...  All three of them.

285
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:31,942
After the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

286
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:35,069
Me?
It's not me he wants, my Queen.

287
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:43,703
Wealthow, my love.
Why don't you do the honors?

288
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,508
For you, my lord.

289
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,724
Thank you, my king.

290
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:15,439
For all of you!

291
00:48:18,817 --> 00:48:22,737
I wish you could've been there last night.
To see me kill the monster.

292
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:29,827
I was asleep when he arrived.
He ripped open the doors with his bare hands.

293
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,706
He stood twenty feet tall,
with a strength of a ten men.

294
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:42,088
I looked at him, and I said:
''I am Beowulf!''

295
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:29,351
Brave thane.
- My queen?

296
00:50:40,194 --> 00:50:50,745
I love you. I want you, my king.
Only you. My hero. I love you.

297
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:57,877
I don't understand. Where is your husband?
- Dead.

298
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:08,887
Dead? This is a dream.
This is not happening, you're just a dream.

299
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:13,974
Me, darling?
A dream?

300
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:19,355
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

301
00:51:53,385 --> 00:52:03,185
In the name of Odin! Is Grendel not dead?
Has he grown his arm anew?

302
00:52:03,977 --> 00:52:09,942
It's not Grendel.
- Not Grendel, then who? - His mother.

303
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:18,658
It's Grendel you killed. I had hoped his
mother had left the land long, long ago.

304
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:23,037
How many monsters must I slay?

305
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:31,336
Grendel's mother, father, Grendel's uncle...
Must I hack down a whole family tree of demons?

306
00:52:31,669 --> 00:52:36,381
She is the last of them. With her gone,
demon-kind will slip back into the darkness

307
00:52:36,715 --> 00:52:40,134
from where it came.
Where it belongs.

308
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:44,556
And the mother's mate.
Where is Grendel's father ?

309
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:50,894
Grendel's father could do no harm to men.

310
00:52:55,065 --> 00:53:01,487
Beowulf, I was wrong to doubt you before.
And I shall not again.

311
00:53:02,238 --> 00:53:06,367
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

312
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:12,622
Granted.
- Cain! Cain!

313
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:28,888
Take my sword. It belonged to my father's father.
It's called "Hrunting".

314
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:33,850
A sword is no match for demon magic.

315
00:53:34,851 --> 00:53:38,020
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

316
00:53:42,024 --> 00:53:46,236
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers

317
00:53:47,488 --> 00:53:49,947
They were... hasty words.

318
00:53:52,908 --> 00:54:00,957
Unferth... I may not return.
Your ancestral sword might be lost with me.

319
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:05,879
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

320
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:23,019
And you, mighty Wiglaf?
Are you still with me?

321
00:54:25,604 --> 00:54:27,064
Till the end.

322
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:56,174
Look!

323
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:06,058
She's probably a water demon.
You don't want to meet her in her element.

324
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:14,606
I know. - You want me to go in with you?
Good. I'll be here.

325
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:27,267
I see you've brought me treasure.

326
00:57:31,605 --> 00:57:37,861
- Show your self!
What are you?

327
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:28,781
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

328
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:52,636
The Be-Wolf, the Bear?

329
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:11,695
Such a strong man you are.
With a strength of a king.

330
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:23,581
The king you will one day become.
- What do you know of me, demon?

331
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:33,757
I know that underneath your glamour,
you're as much a monster as my son, Grendel.

332
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:37,135
My glamour?

333
00:59:38,469 --> 00:59:43,098
One needs glamour to become a king.

334
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:51,230
A man like you, could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

335
00:59:51,855 --> 01:00:00,948
Your story would live on
when everything now alive... is dust.

336
01:00:08,288 --> 01:00:17,837
Beowulf, it has been a long time
since a man has come to visit me.

337
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:26,054
I need no sword to kill you.
- Of course you don't, my love.

338
01:00:28,555 --> 01:00:37,105
You took a son from me.
Give me a son, brave thane.

339
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:43,861
Stay with me, love me...

340
01:00:45,905 --> 01:00:54,703
Love me, and I shall weave you
riches beyond imagination.

341
01:00:55,162 --> 01:01:03,212
I shall make you
the greatest king that ever lived.

342
01:01:11,178 --> 01:01:20,811
As long as you hold me in your heart,
and this golden horn remains in my keeping.

343
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:35,032
You will forever be king.
Forever strong, mighty and all-powerful.

344
01:01:36,784 --> 01:01:49,545
This I promise.
This I swear.

345
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:13,901
My lord.
He's dead, my lady.

346
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:20,990
When I finished-off Grendel's monstrous
mother, I severed the brute's head.

347
01:02:23,075 --> 01:02:27,955
Our curse is lifted.
Our curse is lifted, Odin be praised!

348
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:33,585
Beowulf be praised!
Our curse is lifted.

349
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:40,007
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!
- Into the sea. Quickly!

350
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:49,474
I plunged "Hrunting" into Grendel's
mother chest, and when I pull

351
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:55,020
the sword free from her corpse,
the creature sprang back to life,

352
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:58,065
so I plunged the sword back
into the hag's chest.

353
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:02,528
And there it will stay.
Till Ragnarok...

354
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:09,701
And our people shall be
gratefull 'till the Ragnarok.

355
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:25,548
More mead, my lord? - Aye.
- And the drinking-horn. Do you have it?

356
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:32,721
No, I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

357
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:35,599
And when she followed,
that's when I struck.

358
01:03:36,016 --> 01:03:40,061
With the mighty sword Hrunting.

359
01:03:40,145 --> 01:03:44,564
When she was dead
I looked for it, but it was gone. Forever.

360
01:03:45,566 --> 01:03:49,486
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

361
01:03:50,988 --> 01:03:57,577
First the hero and I must talk.
Beowulf...

362
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:11,339
You brought back the head of Grendel.
But what about the head of the mother?

363
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:19,512
With her dead and cold in the bog,
is it not enough to return one monster's head?

364
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:21,599
Did you kill her?

365
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:27,771
Would you like to hear the story
of my struggle against this monstrous hag?

366
01:04:27,104 --> 01:04:28,897
Huh!...

367
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:33,693
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

368
01:04:33,526 --> 01:04:38,572
But answer me,
did you kill her, huh?

369
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:49,290
Would I've been able to escape her,
had I not?

370
01:04:56,337 --> 01:05:02,844
Grendel is dead. That's all that matters to me.
He can bother me no more.

371
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:09,558
The mother... The "hag",
she's not my curse,

372
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:14,938
Not anymore,
not anymore...

373
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:28,575
Listen to me, listen... to me, huh.
Because my lord Beowulf is a mighty hero,

374
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:37,000
and because he killed the demon Grendel,
and laid its mother in her grave. - To Beowulf!

375
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:50,053
and because I have no heir...
I have no sons, I declare that on my death,

376
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:58,686
all that I possess, my kingdom,
my hall of sadness and shame,

377
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:06,984
and even my lovely young queen,
my Wealthow

378
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:19,912
everything, everything,
I leave to this... Our hero.

379
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:29,130
But, my lord?
- I have spoken! I have spoken!

380
01:06:31,339 --> 01:06:38,054
When I'm gone, Beowulf, son of
Edgethow, shall be king!

381
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:50,190
Beowulf?

382
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:58,573
My lord?
Everything in it's time Beowulf.

383
01:07:13,336 --> 01:07:14,170
Master?!

384
01:07:21,926 --> 01:07:23,387
He...
He must have fallen.

385
01:07:55,081 --> 01:08:02,380
All hail king Beowulf!
- All hail king Beowulf!...

386
01:08:05,299 --> 01:08:07,259
King Beowulf.

387
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,959
Archers. - Archers!

388
01:09:16,363 --> 01:09:21,283
This is not battle, Wiglaf.
This is slaughter.

389
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,872
The Frisians want to make themselves
heroes, my lord.

390
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:30,543
They want the bards to sing of their deeds.
- It's going to be a short song.

391
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,418
How can you blame them,

392
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:37,340
your legend is known from the high seas
and the snow barriers, to the great Iceland Kingdom.

393
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:41,094
You are the moster slayer.
- We may nah the monsters now.

394
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:48,892
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.
The Christ God has killed it,

395
01:09:48,892 --> 01:09:57,482
leaving human kind with noting but weeping
martyrs. Fear and shame.

396
01:09:57,983 --> 01:10:01,988
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to king Beowulf!

397
01:10:04,698 --> 01:10:09,326
Leave him! You think it's sport to
mock your opponent in this fashion?

398
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:13,873
Let him die quickly!
With some honor still intact!

399
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:18,377
Coward! Kill me yourself!

400
01:10:18,252 --> 01:10:23,840
Balls! King must never engage in a direct battle.
Kill the invader now. Do it quickly!

401
01:10:24,508 --> 01:10:26,218
Put his head on a spear.
- Stop!

402
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:41,231
My lord, the king must not engage
in a direct battle.

403
01:10:42,315 --> 01:10:44,942
Let him up.

404
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:51,949
He wants your name.
He's the son of Beowulf.

405
01:10:53,534 --> 01:11:00,040
You think it should end with me killed by
some Frisian raider with no name?

406
01:11:04,168 --> 01:11:09,714
I'm Fin of Frisia. And my name
shall be remembered forever!

407
01:11:10,214 --> 01:11:16,596
Only if you kill me!
Otherwise you're nothing.

408
01:11:17,013 --> 01:11:23,184
You think you're the first who tried
to kill me? Or the hundredth, hm?

409
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:30,233
Well let me tell you something, Frisian.
The gods will not allow my death by your feeble blade.

410
01:11:30,692 --> 01:11:35,613
The gods will not allow me to die by a sword,
or be taken by the sea.

411
01:11:34,945 --> 01:11:39,242
The gods will not let me pass in my sleep...
ripe with age.

412
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:46,205
Plant your axe here, Fin of Frisia.
Take my life.

413
01:11:46,539 --> 01:11:50,752
Someone give him a sword... or I'll... I'll...

414
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:59,008
You'll what?! Kill me?
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

415
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,194
You know why you can't kill me, my friend?

416
01:12:21,028 --> 01:12:25,575
'Cause I died many, many years ago...
when I was young.

417
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:36,376
Give him a gold piece, and send him home.
He has a story to tell.

418
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:11,990
Your majesty? Are you hurt?
- Ah. Not a scratch.

419
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:28,465
You're so beautiful and so young.
You know Ursula, when I was young I

420
01:13:29,048 --> 01:13:35,261
used to think that being a king was about battling every morning and
counting the golden loot in the afternoon.

421
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:45,188
Swiving a beautiful woman every evening...
But now... nothing is as good as it should have been.

422
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:50,443
Not even the "swiving a
beautiful woman every night" part, your majesty?

423
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:59,325
Well... Some nights for sure, some nights...
- Perhaps tonight?

424
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:06,457
No, tonight I fell my age upon me.
Tomorrow after the celebrations.

425
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:09,627
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

426
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:17,342
Your day, when the song of Beowulf is told.
Of how you lifted the darkness from the land.

427
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:23,054
And the day after that, we celebrate the
birth of hallowed Christ.

428
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:30,145
I see you survived.

429
01:14:34,398 --> 01:14:39,779
At last, my queen. The Frisian invaders
had been pushed into the sea.

430
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,491
You are not a widow.
Yet.

431
01:14:46,617 --> 01:14:50,497
How comforting,
my husband.

432
01:14:57,294 --> 01:15:02,966
Hail Beowulf!
Hail Beowulf! Hail Beowulf!...

433
01:16:00,934 --> 01:16:01,727
Unferth!

434
01:16:02,853 --> 01:16:05,564
You're not celebrating your king's
glory tonight?

435
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,316
I have something for the king.

436
01:16:09,276 --> 01:16:13,488
What is it? - I said I have
something for the King.

437
01:16:13,404 --> 01:16:15,490
Show it to me
- I will not!

438
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:22,329
You will show it to me first.
- Bollocks Wiglaf, I'll show it first to Beowulf.

439
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:27,167
The king needs to see it.
- The king? Needs to see what?

440
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,137
Lost,
and now found.

441
01:16:48,852 --> 01:16:56,735
The gift fit for a king.
Do you recognize it?

442
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:06,369
Where did you find this?
- On the moors, my slave, Cain found it

443
01:17:06,243 --> 01:17:12,540
on the barren hill where nothing grows.
I beat him for threading near such an unholy place.

444
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:18,004
My lord, isn't this...?

445
01:17:32,058 --> 01:17:33,601
So, lord Beowulf...

446
01:17:39,648 --> 01:17:44,570
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

447
01:17:46,154 --> 01:17:51,200
My lord, this is the slave who found it.
- Please, please don't kill me.

448
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:56,997
Where did you found this treasure?
- I'm sorry I runned away, master. Please don't hurt me no more.

449
01:17:57,122 --> 01:17:59,707
Answer your king!
- Stop!

450
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:01,876
Stop!

451
01:18:08,758 --> 01:18:18,392
Where? - Up... up on the moors.
But I was going to give it back master, I swear.

452
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:29,693
Is that all? No demon,
no witch, no woman?

453
01:19:01,554 --> 01:19:12,314
Look at you, you're nothing. An empty nothing.
- Come forth! Show yourself!

454
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:26,035
Even with all your riches, your kingdom,
your power, your glory, and your women...

455
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:41,091
Which one do you think I should kill first?
Your pretty little bed-warmer, or your wise queen?

456
01:19:43,134 --> 01:19:45,011
What are you?

457
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:50,975
I am something you left behind.

458
01:19:53,352 --> 01:19:54,019
Father!...

459
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,627
Another restless night?

460
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:32,470
It's all right, girl.
I'm not going to eat you.

461
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:50,861
He has bad dreams. They've become more often.
- He's a king. Kings have a lot on their conscience.

462
01:20:58,118 --> 01:21:04,457
He calls your name in his sleep.
- Does he?

463
01:21:10,129 --> 01:21:17,427
I belive he still holds you in his heart.
- Do you?

464
01:21:20,805 --> 01:21:36,111
I often wonder... What happened?
- To us? Too many secrets...

465
01:21:42,575 --> 01:21:44,744
God, help us.

466
01:22:11,643 --> 01:22:21,735
What... What do you want in me?
- I have a message for my father.

467
01:22:22,277 --> 01:22:28,741
Tell me, what did this?
- I saw a whole village burnt. Children screaming and dying.

468
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:33,871
I saw it, your majesty, vomiting fire and smoke.
- Damn you! What was it?

469
01:22:33,996 --> 01:22:35,831
A dragon.

470
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:42,420
It's Unferth my lord. - Unferth?
- You say a dragon did this. - Stop.

471
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:53,889
You had an agreement, you would not be harmed.
But now the golden horn has return to you,

472
01:22:53,889 --> 01:22:58,685
the agreement is ended.
- Who!? Who said that!?

473
01:22:58,935 --> 01:23:06,901
"The sins of the fathers..." It's the last thing I heard.
The last thing before my family

474
01:23:07,026 --> 01:23:16,493
was burned alive!
Sins of the fathers! Sins of the fathers!...

475
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:24,333
Sins of the fathers! Sins of the fathers!

476
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:33,466
Take up your positions along the
northern edge of a great gauge.

477
01:23:34,133 --> 01:23:37,678
It's our only hope if I fail.
- My lord.

478
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:46,520
Don't go, I beg you.
- You are free. I release you.

479
01:23:47,646 --> 01:23:51,523
Find a good man. Bear him children.
But bear him a son.

480
01:23:51,857 --> 01:23:56,111
I don't want anyone else. I want you.
- I am not the man you think me to be.

481
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,949
You're a great man, and a hero.
This I know to be true.

482
01:24:00,532 --> 01:24:03,325
Then you are as foolish as
the rest of them!

483
01:24:17,339 --> 01:24:23,928
Very impressive, dear. But the armour
suited you better when you were younger.

484
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:26,514
I'm sure it did.

485
01:24:31,685 --> 01:24:36,940
Why don't you take that poor girl,
and leave out your remaining years in peace.

486
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,192
Let some young hero save us.

487
01:24:40,568 --> 01:24:46,407
What? And let the nightmare...
start all over again?

488
01:24:47,491 --> 01:24:54,330
No. I visited this horror upon my kingdom.
I must be the one to finish her.

489
01:24:55,123 --> 01:25:06,341
Her? Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?
Her beauty's so costly?

490
01:25:12,513 --> 01:25:18,310
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

491
01:25:21,647 --> 01:25:32,948
I was weak. I am sorry.
So... So sorry.

492
01:25:37,995 --> 01:25:46,043
I have always loved you my queen.
- And I you.

493
01:25:55,677 --> 01:26:07,813
Keep a memory of me. Not as a king, or a hero.
But as a man. Fallible and flawed.

494
01:26:25,162 --> 01:26:29,708
This is the place.
- Where you slained Grendel's mother.

495
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:41,468
Wiglaf, I have no sons and if this demon
kills me, I have arranged with the heralds

496
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:46,473
that you shall be king.
- Don't speak of such thing, my lord.

497
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:55,397
Great friend, there is something you should know.
- Nay! There is nothing I should know.

498
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:01,445
You are Beowulf! Beowulf the mighty, the hero!
The slayer and destroyer of demons.

499
01:27:01,653 --> 01:27:06,199
Now let us kill this flying devil when he sleeps,
and go on with our bloody lives.

500
01:27:12,162 --> 01:27:17,751
Do you want me to go in with you?
Good.

501
01:28:04,293 --> 01:28:09,881
Beowulf,
it has been a long time.

502
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:22,017
Take your damn horn,
and leave my land in peace.

503
01:28:24,477 --> 01:28:27,689
Too late, my love.

504
01:28:48,582 --> 01:28:50,084
Odin's swifan balls!

505
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,551
It's heading for
Herot.

506
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,036
Hrothgar.

507
01:31:42,154 --> 01:31:42,988
Damn you!

508
01:31:49,662 --> 01:31:53,832
I'll have your lizard head
on a spike!

509
01:34:03,865 --> 01:34:05,362
No!

510
01:36:00,178 --> 01:36:01,371
My lord?!

511
01:38:05,748 --> 01:38:10,592
Over here! Attend the queen!
- Attend the queen...

512
01:39:53,513 --> 01:39:56,156
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

513
01:39:57,933 --> 01:40:02,632
Let's get you to a healer.
- Not this time old friend.

514
01:40:03,146 --> 01:40:08,401
You are Beowulf. Little thing like this
isn't gonna finish you off.

515
01:40:09,569 --> 01:40:12,628
Do you hear her?

516
01:40:15,157 --> 01:40:16,909
I hear nothing.

517
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:24,916
Grendel's mother, my son's mother, my... mine...
- No my lord. You killed Grendel's mother

518
01:40:25,166 --> 01:40:29,378
when we were young.
They sing of it.

519
01:40:30,504 --> 01:40:38,970
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.
Too late...

520
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:49,841
He was the bravest of us.

521
01:41:54,142 --> 01:42:00,003
He was the prince...
of all warriors.

522
01:42:03,379 --> 01:42:06,319
His name
will live forever.

523
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:21,479
His song shall be sung forever.
