1
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,625
What's he doing?

2
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,544
Working.

3
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,775
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

4
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,443
Maybe it's been modified.

5
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:15,569
The tail is wrong.

6
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:16,654
It's just backwards.

7
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,893
Why have you failed me?

8
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,395
We're working.

9
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,064
Diligently.

10
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,066
I let you live.

11
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,278
This is how you repay me?

12
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,281
It's very complex.

13
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,034
He's trying very hard.

14
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,410
On his knees.

15
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,750
You think I'm a fool?

16
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:36,794
I'll get the truth.

17
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:38,879
We're both working.

18
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,471
Open your mouth.

19
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,225
You think I'm a fool?

20
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,605
What's going on?

21
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,608
Tell me the truth.

22
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,277
He's building your Jericho.

23
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,471
Where is Stark?

24
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,723
He was here a moment ago.

25
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:55,933
Go look for him.

26
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:26,457
Hurry it up.

27
01:16:26,542 --> 01:16:27,750
Put the women in the trucks.

28
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:28,876
Stack the weapons here.

29
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:29,961
Clear all the houses.

30
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:31,713
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

31
01:16:39,888 --> 01:16:40,888
Grab that dog.

32
01:16:43,851 --> 01:16:45,977
Put him with the others.

33
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:58,197
What the hell is this?

34
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:11,711
Shoot this dog.

35
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:13,463
You're all incompetent.

36
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:17,800
Turn your head.

37
01:27:41,633 --> 01:27:44,593
This is the only gift you shall receive.
