1
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,723
You shoud be practicing.

2
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:31,423
I am practicing

3
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,555
What you're doing, you won't be needing these.

4
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:34,890
What's your problem?

5
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,186
What do we learn here?

6
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:06,766
No weakness! No pain! No mercy!

7
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,997
Begin!

8
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:42,049
He's had enough.

9
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,350
Don't you remember what we learned?

10
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,332
No weakness. No pain.

11
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,985
No mercy!

12
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,295
Go home.

13
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:06,757
What are you doing?
Why did you stop?

14
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:10,524
Finish!

15
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:17,023
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get out of here.

16
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:24,207
We do not stop when our enemy is down!

17
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:26,401
No mercy.

18
00:46:26,434 --> 00:46:28,435
No mercy in the studio.

19
00:46:28,454 --> 00:46:31,337
No mercy in life.

20
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:38,495
What are you looking at?

21
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:41,674
He's the one that attacked me.

22
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,421
We are here to make peace.

23
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:00,893
Let your little thing mind himself.

24
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:03,540
One to one, no problem...

25
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,989
Six to one,
too much to ask of anyone.

26
00:47:09,088 --> 00:47:11,640
I see.

27
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:14,265
Prepare for match!

28
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:25,989
We are not here to fight.

29
00:47:29,732 --> 00:47:33,633
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

30
00:47:33,936 --> 00:47:37,550
You want to leave?
Not so easy.

31
00:47:38,675 --> 00:47:41,482
Master Li...

32
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,382
You both came here.

33
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:50,814
One of you fights now.

34
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,992
The boy will fight there.

35
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:04,808
OPEN KUNG FU TOURNAMENT

36
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:14,983
We accept your challenge.

37
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:21,864
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

38
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:25,335
Attention!

39
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:30,968
From now on the little thing
is to be left alone...

40
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:33,047
until the tournament.

41
00:48:33,062 --> 00:48:36,227
- Understood?!
- Yes!

42
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:45,356
If he does not show up
for the competition...

43
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:50,405
I will bring pain to him and you.

44
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:27,960
Sir...

45
01:43:28,766 --> 01:43:31,586
My name is Dre Parker.

46
01:43:31,596 --> 01:43:39,160
My actions have brought
dishonor to your family.

47
01:43:39,161 --> 01:43:44,280
Your daughter has been
a great friend to me.

48
01:43:44,281 --> 01:43:47,452
And from her I have learned...

49
01:43:47,965 --> 01:43:50,306
...that a true friend...

50
01:43:50,311 --> 01:43:53,524
...is a person
who makes your life better.

51
01:43:53,572 --> 01:43:58,550
But, if you give me a second chance...

52
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:02,437
...I promise that I will be...

53
01:44:02,438 --> 01:44:10,380
...the best friend your
daughter has ever had.

54
01:45:23,646 --> 01:45:27,712
Let the tournament begin!

55
01:50:34,073 --> 01:50:38,582
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

56
01:50:58,616 --> 01:51:03,473
<i>And now the 1st semi-final
of the evening.</i>

61
01:54:22,262 --> 01:54:25,782
You're disqualified!

62
01:54:49,698 --> 01:54:52,591
He's done.

63
01:54:52,592 --> 01:54:54,128
I'm sorry, you should not continue.

64
01:54:54,837 --> 01:54:56,180
You've brought honor to your family.

65
01:55:19,995 --> 01:55:23,302
Dre Parker has 2 minutes 
to return to the match.

66
01:55:23,303 --> 01:55:26,128
If he is unable to return . . .

67
01:55:26,129 --> 01:55:30,880
. . . the Fighting Dragons win by default.

68
01:57:27,618 --> 01:57:34,117
Since Dre Parker has 
not returned to the ring . . .

69
01:57:52,596 --> 01:57:57,299
Dre Parker will fight!

70
02:01:55,206 --> 02:01:58,910
No mercy.

71
02:03:07,097 --> 02:03:12,470
The score is tied.
The next point wins!
