1
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,098
<i>There was nothing special</i>
<i>about Somerset County.</i>

2
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,809
<i>It was a deeply ordinary place.</i>

3
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,144
<i>No astonishing thing</i>
<i>ever happened there.</i>

4
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,183
<i>The people who lived there</i>
<i>were just regular people.</i>

5
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,448
<i>And the animals...</i>
<i>Well, they were just plain old animals.</i>

6
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,324
<i>They didn't question the order of things.</i>

7
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,194
<i>So, the days passed,</i>
<i>one very much like the other.</i>

8
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,662
<i>But, one spring, on a small farm,</i>

9
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,598
<i>a little girl did something,</i>

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,008
<i>something that</i>
<i>would change everything.</i>

11
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,541
What are you doing?

12
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,314
Fern, go back to bed.

13
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,384
You're not going to kill it, are you?

14
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,509
It's a runt. Now, go back to bed.

15
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,352
No, it's not fair!
It can't help being born small.

16
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,424
Careful.

17
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,422
If I'd been born small,
would you have killed me?

18
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,855
Of course not.

19
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:54,799
A little girl is one thing.
A runty pig is another.

20
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,365
There's no difference!
This is unfair and unjust.

21
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,534
How could you be so heartless?

22
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,906
Come here.
I want to show you something.

23
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,172
You see that? You see?

24
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,575
There's 11 pigs and only 10 teats.

25
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,712
Sow can't feed it, honey.

26
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,552
Then I will.

27
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,425
I'll feed you and take care of you and...

28
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,969
...absolutely will not let you kill him.

29
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,155
-Hey! When did Fern get a pig?
-Avery, it's rude to point. Give me that.

30
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,522
Come, sit, eat your breakfast.
The bus will be here any minute.

31
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,322
Good morning.

32
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,694
Hey, Pop, can I have a pig, too?

33
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,266
No. I only give pigs to early risers.

34
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,862
Fern was up before dawn,
ridding the world of injustice.

35
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,601
Fern, put that pig down
and get to school.

36
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,835
Avery.

37
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,043
-See ya.
-Bye, Pop.

38
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,838
Have a good one, buddy.

39
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,477
Says here we're gonna get
a lot of rain this month.

40
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,053
Fern! Your books!

41
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,687
Bye.

42
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,727
Class, these are some of the questions

43
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,169
that you're likely to be asked
in the exam this week.

44
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,905
So, please take particular note
of every one.

45
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,177
You got to be quiet, okay?
You're gonna get me in trouble.

46
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,683
Drink that.

47
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,815
So, it's just a matter of
following these questions

48
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,893
and learning the answers.

49
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,322
Fern, what's going on?

50
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:07,993
Nothing.

51
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,799
Fern, what's in your desk?

52
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,600
-Nothing.
-Open it.

53
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,914
Thank you, Mrs. Arable.

54
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,182
Fern, you know better.

55
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:38,195
It's a pig, okay?
It's not a toy, not a doll, not a baby.

56
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,491
A pig.

57
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,457
And you need to start
treating it like one.

58
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,634
This is going too far.

59
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,451
I know she loves animals,
but you have to tell her.

60
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,250
-I know. She's just so happy with it.
-I know.

61
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,989
Doesn't that feel good?

62
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,229
Fern, I'm really sorry, honey,
but it's been long enough.

63
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,630
What?

64
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,434
Look, he's not a baby anymore.

65
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,772
I can't have you keeping what will soon
be a 300-pound pet around the house.

66
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,935
No.

67
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,946
Can't he stay in the barn? Please, Dad?

68
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,880
-No.
-Please?

69
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,043
No. Fern, look.
You know I've been selling the animals

70
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,314
to get the new harvesting equipment.

71
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,648
Pretty soon there's gonna be
no place in the barn for a pig.

72
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,191
I promised I'd take care of him.

73
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,729
Well, I'm letting you
out of your promise.

74
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,025
I didn't promise you. I promised Wilbur.

75
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,735
What about Homer?

76
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,938
He has animals.

77
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,070
Uncle Homer?

78
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,575
I'm sure he could make room for a pig.

79
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,641
Yeah.

80
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,852
He'd be right across the road.

81
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,360
<i>Go to sleep, my little one</i>

82
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,104
<i>The sun has said goodbye for now</i>

83
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:38,078
<i>The moon shines on your beautiful face</i>

84
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,447
My mom used to sing that to me
to make me feel safe.

85
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,152
Good night,

86
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,992
Wilbur.

87
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,606
<i>Fern had walked across the road to her</i>
<i>uncle's barn hundreds of times before,</i>

88
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,668
<i>but it had never felt so far away.</i>

89
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,147
<i>It was just a big red barn</i>
<i>full of typical stuff.</i>

90
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,186
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>it couldn't have been more ordinary.</i>

91
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,751
<i>But sometimes,</i>
<i>when you take two ordinary things</i>

92
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,352
<i>and put them together</i>
<i>at just the right time,</i>

93
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,791
<i>there's a chance they'll become</i>
<i>two less ordinary things.</i>

94
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,035
<i>That runty pig, for instance,</i>
<i>and that big old smelly barn.</i>

95
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,106
<i>One sniff, and you knew it was a place</i>
<i>full of living things.</i>

96
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,012
<i>But that didn't necessarily mean</i>
<i>it was full of life.</i>

97
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,512
It's okay. It's okay.

98
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,209
<i>Nope. For that, this barn needed a pig.</i>

99
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,683
This isn't so bad.

100
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,111
<i>Only no one knew it yet.</i>

101
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,552
Don't be afraid.

102
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,190
You'll be okay.

103
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,232
I'll come see you every day.

104
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,195
I'll be around so much
you'll be sick of me.

105
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,644
I love you.

106
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,027
Avery, the bus is here!

107
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,427
-Did you remember your sister's lunch?
-Got it!

108
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,819
What the hay?

109
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,727
-What's he doing?
-Probably-obably something smart.

110
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,323
-Pigs are smart.
-Pigs are not smart!

111
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,097
Apparently, they're as intelligent
as dolphins.

112
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,701
Advantage dolphin.

113
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,435
-He's going to knock himself out.
-Yeah! That's using your head!

114
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,875
How many times is he going to try that?

115
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,875
-Pig's out!
-I told you pigs are smart.

116
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,848
That's going to leave a mark.

117
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,888
-Oh, look, Bits. Pig's out.
-Sure is out.

118
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,183
Out of his mind!

119
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,896
Homer!

120
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,092
Lurvy!

121
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,631
-Pig's out!
-Pig's out, pig's out, pig's out!

122
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,670
-How about you walk a little faster?
-Wait your turn!

123
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,501
Wait! Wait! Fern, come back!

124
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,836
Just run!

125
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,435
Run, pig! Be free! I would if I could.

126
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,571
Retreat!

127
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,945
-Retreat!
-Don't retreat, pig! Giddyup!

128
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,848
-Oh, no! Not the smokehouse!
-No! Not the smokehouse!

129
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,119
-Is he looking?
-Yeah, he's seen it.

130
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,955
-Think he knows what it is?
-Of course not.

131
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,689
He's a spring pig.
He doesn't know anything.

132
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,500
Here, pig, pig, pig!

133
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,807
Don't fall for it. You're out.

134
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,233
And you're back in.

135
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,970
Here you go, piggy.

136
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,609
Attaboy. Eat it up.

137
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,810
Sold out for slop.
I'd have been to the county line by now.

138
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,943
He'd have made it
if you'd have just let me talk.

139
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,522
-Made it to where? He's a pig!
-He's a pig.

140
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,050
Sorry I made such a fuss.
Your suggestions were really good,

141
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,892
but I think I'd better stay here.
Fern's going to be back soon, anyway.

142
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,489
He's just stupid as a stick, poor thing.

143
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,694
-Should we speak to him?
-Certainly not!

144
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,827
Certainly not.

145
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,633
Sweetheart, it sounded-ounded
almost like you said

146
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,571
you'd run and be free if you could.

147
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,200
I meant if I were a pig.

148
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,438
You know what happens to pigs
around here.

149
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,846
Yes, I do.
And it should never, ever be spoken of.

150
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,225
I'm gonna miss you today.

151
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,531
See you when I get back, okay?

152
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,000
All right, I gotta go, okay? See you later.

153
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,780
Bye.

154
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,231
Goodbye, Fern. Hurry back.

155
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,203
Hi.

156
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,670
My name's Wilbur.

157
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,000
Anyone want to play?

158
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,970
Anyone?

159
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,404
It's raining, you know. And you know what you get with rain?

160
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,112
-Lightning.
-Typhoons.

161
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,514
-Cholera.
-Dysentery.

162
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,245
-Frizzy hair.
-That sad feeling.

163
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,650
No, mud!

164
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,813
What the heck is he doing now?

165
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,518
Hey, come on. You wanna join me?
Come on! Let's go!

166
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,184
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

167
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,422
Let's not.
How many times must I tell you?

168
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,297
Just because we're sheep,
it doesn't mean we have to follow.

169
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,160
Think for yourselves.

170
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,237
-Yourselves. Quite right!
-Look at me!

171
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,602
-No, no, no. Yourselves.
-Myself?

172
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,503
Hey, kid, this is a barn.
We don't play, we work.

173
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,580
-Some of us, anyway.
-"Some of us"?

174
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,649
Are you implying, lke,
that we don't work?

175
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,379
Because we work bloody hard,
thank you!

176
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,546
Hard? You grow hair!

177
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,721
"Grow hair." Good one!

178
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,483
Excuse me.

179
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,530
And is that your contribution to society,
you gassy rib eyes?

180
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,122
Filthy hairball!

181
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,394
-Rib eyes!
-Dirty lintball!

182
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,560
Zip it.

183
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,762
-They're at it again.
-Rib eyes! Rib eyes!

184
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,567
It's really slippery. That's the fun part!

185
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,541
Little itty-bitty pig,
could you come here, please?

186
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,371
You said your name is Wilbur, right?

187
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,244
That's right. What's your name?

188
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,873
-Gussy.
-Gussy?

189
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,214
-Great name!
-Thank you, Wilbur.

190
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,949
Now, you're so cute and pink,
but you're wasting your time.

191
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,285
These animals won't play.

192
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,053
-What about you?
-Me?

193
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,628
Well, I have to stay on my eggs.

194
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,822
Oh, wow! Look at that!

195
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,498
Otherwise, of course, I'd love to play.

196
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,535
So, why can't you play?

197
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,231
Because what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

198
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,036
What about the rest of you?
Don't any of you like to play?

199
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,111
Can't play on three empty stomachs.

200
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,773
Well, for us there's this whole
smell-of-wet-wool business. Ghastly!

201
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,080
See? I'm afraid
it's just not a play kind of place.

202
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,844
But you're all friends, right?

203
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,480
Sure. We've been here together
our whole lives.

204
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,754
I'm not so sure being in the same place
is the same as being friends.

205
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,925
I'm not hungry.
I just wanted someone to play with me.

206
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,668
What's that?

207
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,637
What is...

208
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,303
Could it be?

209
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,345
Slops!

210
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:26,714
Oh, joy. It seems the pig slop
has brought out the rodent.

211
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,810
Moldy cheese. Oh, yeah.

212
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,350
Did I have salami last night?

213
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,453
Yep. I guess I did.

214
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,294
-Oh, charming.
-Disgusting creature!

215
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,697
Hi, there.

216
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,635
Oh, you're a pig.

217
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,666
You're a pig.

218
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,666
Pig equals slop.

219
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,671
The rat is happy.

220
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,141
My name's Wilbur.

221
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,944
Do you have a name?
Or is it just "the rat"?

222
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,250
Did you say "just the rat"?

223
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,325
For your information, pig, the rat rules.

224
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,525
We were here long before your kind,
and we'll be here long after.

225
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,191
So, you just keep that in mind

226
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,634
next time you feel like
reducing me to "just the rat."

227
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,535
You called yourself "the rat."

228
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,640
I can call me that. You can't.

229
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,112
So you don't have a name?

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,948
Of course I do. It's Templeton.

231
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,081
Templeton? Great name!

232
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,382
-Oh, gee, thanks.
-Hey! You want to play, Templeton?

233
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,855
For so many reasons, no.

234
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,818
See, I don't play.

235
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,862
I gnaw, I spy, I eat, I hide.
Me in a nutshell.

236
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,796
Couldn't you just stay and chat?

237
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,869
Chat? Let me see.

238
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,264
Gnaw, spy, eat, hide.

239
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,773
Nope, "chat" ain't on the list.

240
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,351
The rat is handsome.

241
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,347
Tonight I dream of slop!

242
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,051
Fern, you are not going to see
that pig again. It's too late.

243
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,714
But he's expecting me!

244
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,156
And I'm expecting you to finish
your homework and go straight to bed.

245
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,786
But, Mom, I always tell him good night!

246
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,661
-Not tonight.
-He can't sleep if I don't.

247
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,831
Good night.

248
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,900
Good night.

249
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,734
Good night!

250
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,139
Good night.

251
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,843
Huh? Who said that?

252
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,615
Who are you?

253
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,617
Where are you? Are you invisible?

254
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,448
No, I'm nocturnal,

255
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,682
which means I work at night,
when you should be sleeping.

256
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,415
Now, I need to concentrate,
so, good night.

257
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,355
But I can't sleep now!
Please, tell me who you are.

258
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,060
I'm just really lonely.

259
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,833
So I've seen.

260
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,804
Look, you seem like a very nice pig,
so I'll tell you what.

261
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,741
If you go to sleep right now
and let me work,

262
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,743
we can converse tomorrow.

263
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,370
-Converse?
-I think your word was "chat."

264
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,016
Oh. Great! All right.

265
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,879
Good night. Good night. Good night.

266
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,519
Good night.

267
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,330
Okay, he still hasn't moved.

268
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,267
We've been here one, wait, two...

269
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,368
We've been here a long time, Elwyn,
and that guy ain't moving!

270
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,443
He's like a freak of nature.

271
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,711
I'm dying, man.
I've got to get some corn!

272
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,150
I know, Brooksie. Just be patient.

273
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,651
Come on.

274
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,694
Come on.

275
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,857
Just a little further.

276
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,759
Okay, it's morning!

277
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,230
-Hey, Bits, I wasn't drooling, was I?
-Suck it up, Bets.

278
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,571
Would whoever addressed me last night
kindly make yourself known?

279
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,976
What luck! An early riser,
and he has things he needs to say.

280
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,981
Yeah, loud things.

281
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,949
I'm speaking to whoever spoke to me
last night.

282
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,883
I suppose that would be me.

283
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,479
Okay.

284
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,682
-I can't see you.
-Up here, in the corner.

285
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,393
The other corner.

286
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,731
I'm sorry. I still can't see you.

287
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,229
Move a little closer. I'll come down.

288
00:21:23,848 --> 00:21:26,009
Hi. You're a...

289
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,449
Look, I've got a long day ahead of me
and I'm trying to get a little...

290
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,316
Spider! Spider! Get it away from me!

291
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,719
Get it away! Get it away!

292
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:34,915
All right, keep your distance there.

293
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:38,860
-That thing is creepy.
-Golly! You're not being rude, are you?

294
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:43,195
No, no, no. I meant "creepy"
in a nice way. You know, creepy good.

295
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,393
Disgusting!

296
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:46,765
-They eat their menfolk, you know.
-I know!

297
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:50,068
Well? Still want to chat,
or are you gonna join them?

298
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,438
I've never met a spider before.

299
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,174
Did you make that?

300
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:57,779
Is that what you were concentrating on
last night?

301
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:00,510
-Yes.
-It's amazing.

302
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:03,910
Think you could teach me
how to make one of those?

303
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,420
Hold that thought, please.

304
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:14,593
-What are you doing?
-Making breakfast.

305
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,595
-Oh, boy.
-Relax.

306
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,201
First, I give him a little nip
to anesthetize him,

307
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,862
so he'll be more comfortable.

308
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,736
It's a little service I throw in.

309
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:25,570
Then I wrap him up.

310
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,769
Then I just say grace because,
well, that's always nice,

311
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,439
and he'll make a
perfectly delicious meal.

312
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:34,313
So, you eat flies?

313
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:36,109
No, no, no.

314
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,722
I drink their blood.

315
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,852
-Lying down on the job, eh?
-Fainted like a girl.

316
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,326
That's disgusting.

317
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:47,996
Well, that's easy for you to say.

318
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:51,193
You have all your meals
brought to you in a pail.

319
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,236
I don't get that kind of royal treatment.

320
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,770
I am a trapper.

321
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:58,672
I have to catch my food.
Which is why I make my home near you.

322
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:02,177
-Please don't hurt me.
-Well, since you said "please."

323
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:07,140
And just imagine how many bugs
there would be in this barn,

324
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,549
no, actually, in the world,

325
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,383
if spiders didn't catch them.

326
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,252
Insects would take over the planet!

327
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:15,882
The way I see it,
I'm doing everyone a favor.

328
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,718
Except for the fly.

329
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,425
Yes. Except for the fly.

330
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,267
I think now is the time
for me to say salutations.

331
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:30,967
What?

332
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,336
Salutations.

333
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,839
Okay. I'll leave.

334
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,380
No, Wilbur.

335
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,543
"Salutations" is just a fancy way
of saying hello.

336
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,787
Oh! Hello.

337
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,787
Hey, you know my name! What's yours?

338
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,520
My name?

339
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:53,126
My name is Charlotte.
Charlotte A. Cavatica.

340
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,125
Charlotte. Great name!

341
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:59,166
Thank you. I've always thought so.

342
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,205
Hey, since you've said...

343
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,705
You know, that word,

344
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,674
does that mean we're friends?

345
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:09,740
I suppose it does.

346
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,314
Yeah!

347
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:17,312
Golly, go see what's going-oing on
over there.

348
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:21,448
What's going-oing...
Hey, kid, what's going on over here?

349
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,790
Oh, sorry.
I just made a new friend, that's all.

350
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,487
The spider. Oh, yeah. Good choice.

351
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,223
Yeah, perfect.

352
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:34,404
You picked someone
even more despised than me.

353
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:37,230
Why would anyone despise Charlotte?

354
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,238
She made that amazing web,
and she keeps bugs out of the barn.

355
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:44,139
Look at her.
I mean, don't you think she's a little...

356
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,713
What's the word?

357
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,984
I think she's beautiful.

358
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,288
I beg your pardon. She is hideous!

359
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,328
Are we even seeing
the same ruddy creature?

360
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,393
I guess not.

361
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,628
Hopeless.

362
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:10,369
What a sorry little friendship
that's going to be.

363
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:16,506
<i>There's an old expression that says</i>
<i>that ignorance is bliss,</i>

364
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,246
<i>and I'm inclined to believe it's true,</i>

365
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,814
<i>because, on that late spring day,</i>

366
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,285
<i>Wilbur was as happy as a pig could be.</i>

367
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,352
<i>And those spring days</i>
<i>rolled into summer days,</i>

368
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,927
<i>days filled with endless conversation</i>

369
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:34,759
<i>between the two unlikeliest of friends.</i>

370
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,163
Charlotte, what's a spring pig?

371
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,168
A pig who was born in the spring.

372
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,670
Oh. And I thought it meant bouncy.

373
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:44,002
That would be a springy pig.

374
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,207
"After Mrs. Mallard had laid eight eggs
in the nest,

375
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,405
"she couldn't go to visit
Michael anymore,

376
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:53,176
"because she had to sit on the eggs
to keep them warm.

377
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:57,345
"She moved off the nest only to get
a drink of water, or to have her lunch,

378
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,549
"or to count the eggs
and make sure they were all there.

379
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:05,318
"One day, the ducklings hatched out.
First came Jack, then Kack..."

380
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,158
Yeah! Yeah! This is going to be great!

381
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:10,324
-Wilbur, what on earth are you doing?
-You'll see.

382
00:26:11,502 --> 00:26:13,470
That feels marvelous!

383
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,096
Yes, over to the left a bit. Ah, yes.

384
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,973
Is that a breeze I feel?
I'm 10 pounds lighter!

385
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,169
-I'm next!
-I'm next!

386
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:22,836
-I'm next!
-I'm next, too!

387
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,575
-Looking pretty good, huh?
-Sure is.

388
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,341
Hi, there. Are you new to the barn?
I'm Wilbur.

389
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:31,045
Wilbur, it's me.

390
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:32,850
Me? Great name!

391
00:26:33,057 --> 00:26:36,288
No, me. Me! Samuel! The sheep!

392
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:39,492
Wow! What happened to you?

393
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,838
The world's first pig web! Ta-da!

394
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:51,773
I think you'd better
leave the web-spinning to me.

395
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,673
After weeks and weeks,

396
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:58,579
and I'm talking about some long weeks
of waiting and expecting,

397
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:02,311
all the hard work has finally paid off.

398
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,354
Wow! Look at them! They were eggs,

399
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:08,584
and now they're... They're just...
Look at them!

400
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:11,484
Wow, Gussy,
you did a really terrific job!

401
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:13,563
They don't call me Mother Goose
for nothing.

402
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:14,961
Congratulations.

403
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,191
Would you look at that!

404
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,163
Yes, thank you, thank you!

405
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,171
It wasn't easy, but I managed.

406
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,740
You managed?

407
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,607
I'm kidding, honey. We managed.

408
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:30,910
Six, seven. Weren't there eight eggs?

409
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,878
Could this be a dud?

410
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,815
Golly! Golly!

411
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,319
-Golly!
-Whoa!

412
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:40,948
Whoa, there, Father Goose!
I'm just trying to help the happy couple.

413
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,151
What do you want
with a rotten egg, anyway?

414
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,024
I want a rotten egg

415
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,224
for the simple reason that...
You never know.

416
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,891
This one didn't make it.

417
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,866
I think we have to let it go.

418
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,872
Oh, take it!

419
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:59,067
And add it
to that nasty-asty collection of yours.

420
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:01,908
Last one out is a rotten egg!

421
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:05,942
-Well, I thought it was funny.
-I should have pecked him!

422
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,608
Don't you break that egg, rat.

423
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,380
A broken rotten egg would make
this barn stink to high heaven.

424
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,353
That would be a change.

425
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,690
Why are you laughing, Bits?
He just said we stink.

426
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,489
Oh, yeah. This is good.
This will come in handy.

427
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,828
You really are a handsome devil.

428
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:29,369
Oh, boy.

429
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,257
Egg-xactly!

430
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,403
Saw a big old spider in the doorway!
Gonna go catch it!

431
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,442
No, Avery! Come back here!

432
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,910
-Here, spidey-spidey.
-You can't do that!

433
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,007
Stop!

434
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,587
-Gotcha!
-No, no, Avery!

435
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,322
Wilbur, no! Come on, Wilbur, get off!

436
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,457
Wilbur, Wilbur, why did you do that?

437
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:28,321
Avery! No!

438
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,939
That stinks!

439
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,012
Oh, that is gross.

440
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:48,849
Man, is that you?

441
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,945
No. I smell a smell, though.
Think it's scary guy?

442
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,752
-He's trying to stink us away from the...
-Corn!

443
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,728
Guess the yolk's on me.

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,661
That is one ripe egg.

445
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,270
That stinks good!

446
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:12,166
That is disgusting!

447
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:17,412
-We told you not to break that egg.
-Now look what you've done, rat!

448
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:19,277
It saved Charlotte, didn't it?

449
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:22,875
Yeah, ingrates.
I saved the leggy lady's life.

450
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,048
-You mean that as a good thing, right?
-Of course.

451
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:28,056
I do have a few eyes, you know,

452
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,285
and I think
Wilbur did most of the saving.

453
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:32,419
I know. Ironic, isn't it?

454
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:36,625
He's saving you,
and they're saving him for Christmas.

455
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,792
Templeton!

456
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,232
What's Christmas?

457
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,897
The day you'll be cured.

458
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:44,572
But I'm not sick.

459
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,869
I didn't say you were sick.

460
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:50,140
-Uh-oh. That was a mistake.
-Yep. Typical rat.

461
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:54,274
What? You're going to lie
to the future football here? Okay.

462
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:58,618
But it's a sad statement when
I'm the most honest guy in the place.

463
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,053
Templeton, what are you talking about?

464
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:03,522
Come winter,
the farmer will be checking you

465
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:05,857
into the old smokehouse hotel.

466
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:11,926
And the only checking out that happens
is when people gather around and say,

467
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,703
"Check out that yummy sausage.

468
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,367
"Check out that sizzling bacon."

469
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,644
So, that's what that is for.

470
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:26,209
Ain't for roasting chestnuts.

471
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:31,643
He wouldn't. Humans love pigs.

472
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:34,820
Well, they love pork.

473
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,885
Well, this is awkward, isn't it?

474
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:40,693
Charlotte!

475
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,293
Charlotte, is it true?

476
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,166
Wilbur, few spring pigs get to see
the snows of winter.

477
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:50,035
No! I can't believe this. I won't believe it.

478
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,903
-Oh, Wilbur.
-It isn't fair!

479
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:55,939
-I want to live! I want to see the snow!
-And you will.

480
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,775
I'm making you a promise right now.
I am not going to let them kill you.

481
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:03,680
You're a spider. You're little.
They're huge!

482
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,721
How are you going to stop them?

483
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,018
I have no idea. But it's a promise,

484
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,059
and promises are something
I never break.

485
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,826
Just don't you worry about it, Wilbur.

486
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,398
Besides, it's a long time
until Christmas.

487
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,597
Okay, Charlotte. If you say so.

488
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:33,582
-Dad?
-Yeah.

489
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:36,209
Can I walk home? I promised Wilbur
I'd be there right away.

490
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,117
-Sure. That's fine with me.
-Thanks.

491
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,484
Fern, wait!

492
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:44,591
Why don't you go to the Whites'
or the Sergeants' today and play?

493
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:46,993
-Or you could have someone over.
-Why?

494
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,831
Because you're spending too much time
in that barn.

495
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:52,128
It isn't good for you
to be alone so much.

496
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,404
Alone? All my best friends are there.

497
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,468
-Except the rat.
-The rat?

498
00:32:57,574 --> 00:33:00,042
I wouldn't call him my friend,
but the rest of them are.

499
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,305
They tell the greatest stories.
They make me laugh.

500
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,780
And I promised them I'd read 'em
this book, so I got to go. Bye!

501
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,519
Dr. Dorian, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

502
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:13,980
To think that animals can actually talk?

503
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,926
I don't know. Maybe an animal said
something to me and I didn't hear it

504
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:20,155
because I wasn't paying attention.

505
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:24,894
Maybe children are just better listeners
than we are.

506
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,600
Well, it worries me to no end.

507
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:33,332
What's got you worried is that her only
friends are pigs, sheep, geese and rats.

508
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,272
Well, not rats.

509
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,514
No.

510
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:39,710
-Does she look well?
-Yes.

511
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,580
Appetite's good?

512
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,076
-Does she sleep well at night?
-Yes.

513
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,156
I mean, she's right as rain in that way.

514
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,385
Well, there is a name for her condition.

515
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,994
It's called a childhood phase.

516
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,625
<i>And, sadly,</i>
<i>it's something she'll grow out of.</i>

517
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,478
Charlotte, what are you doing?

518
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:09,970
Thinking.

519
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:12,238
I do my best thinking upside down.

520
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:14,579
Blood goes to my head
and perks me up.

521
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:18,546
I've been thinking, too, you know,
about Christmas.

522
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:22,152
Don't worry, Wilbur.
We'll figure something out.

523
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,762
Come on, lke. Come on.

524
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:41,276
Not to be too much trouble,

525
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,938
but have you figured something out?

526
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:47,143
Not yet, but it's like a web.

527
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,779
You make it, you wait,
and something always comes.

528
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:53,622
Good night, Charlotte.

529
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,422
Good night, Wilbur.

530
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:01,124
And swing.

531
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,030
And stick.

532
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,202
And loop.

533
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,878
And back up, stick, and...

534
00:36:45,402 --> 00:36:47,597
Mr. Zuckerman!

535
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,570
Okay, you gotta come see this.

536
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:02,084
Come on, Homer!

537
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:03,878
Come on!

538
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,862
-What's a "so me pig"?
-It's "some pig."

539
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,334
It's a miracle.

540
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,305
It's nothing short of a bona fide miracle.

541
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,280
Minister Beecher?

542
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:09,518
Homer. Edith.

543
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,649
What brings you here?

544
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:13,279
Divinity?

545
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:17,024
We think so.

546
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:36,405
We'd better keep this quiet
until I address it in my sermon.

547
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,509
You can't tell a soul,
but you gotta come up to the barn.

548
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:39,582
Keep it between me and you.

549
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,116
-Swing by the farm.
-Okay. Goodbye.

550
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:52,622
Now, don't tell nobody.
Shouldn't get around.

551
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,698
There's a word in a spider web
at Zuckerman's barn.

552
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:22,191
Charlotte, what does a "some pig" do?

553
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:25,090
This isn't for what you do.
It's for what you are.

554
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:27,259
Some pigs might smile a bit.

555
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,606
The lifting of the head, nice touch!

556
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:02,195
As ugly as that spider is,
we should have known she was smart.

557
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,268
So, you don't believe that someone
might be smart and pretty?

558
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:08,565
No. Yes! I mean, yes, because you are.

559
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,640
Clever little spider, isn't she?

560
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,799
Where's the spider who did this?

561
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:17,202
Well, we looked all over
and couldn't find one.

562
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,247
Looks pretty good.

563
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:26,948
Still ain't gonna change anything.
He's a goner.

564
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:29,582
Yeah. Glad nobody eats cows.

565
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:34,153
-Got to admit, that's a fine-looking pig.
-Yep, that's some pig, all right.

566
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,005
<i>After a few weeks,</i>
<i>the phenomenon of the web wore off.</i>

567
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:48,567
<i>Nobody cared anymore,</i>

568
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>and what was amazing yesterday</i>
<i>was suddenly ordinary again today.</i>

569
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:58,821
<i>It looked like</i>
<i>Wilbur might not see snow after all.</i>

570
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:06,020
Excuse me, but why are we here?

571
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:09,565
I mean, yes, barn meeting and so on
and so forth. I understand that.

572
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:14,194
But must this concern us?
And at such an ungodly hour!

573
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:16,067
You know, Wilbur's not the only one

574
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:19,801
who could end up being Christmas
dinner with an apple in his mouth.

575
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,472
Good point. Yes. Carry on, then.

576
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:25,207
Ike, this involves every one of us.

577
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:29,547
I just have trouble looking at you.
That's all.

578
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,721
This isn't about me. It's about Wilbur.

579
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:35,382
And, for the record, my view of you
is not exactly a treat, either.

580
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:40,057
As we have all seen,
humans have very short attention spans,

581
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,597
and there's just too much time
between now and Christmas.

582
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,463
Certainly enough time for
Zuckerman to find his affection for a pig

583
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:47,160
losing out to his hunger for ham.

584
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,238
-That spider can talk!
-Yeah.

585
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,139
What did she say, exactly?

586
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:54,677
She said the farmer might possibly
still slaughter the pig.

587
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,872
Sorry, old chap,
but it is a common fate for your ilk.

588
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:00,573
I could just
bust through the fence again.

589
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,515
No. Once was enough for that.

590
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,678
I just have to get the right word written.

591
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,881
Something that makes Wilbur
so special

592
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,424
that Zuckerman will never
think about killing him again.

593
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:12,620
You need something snappy,
like "pig supreme."

594
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:14,128
That sounds like a dessert.

595
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,357
So, what's the point, anyway?
It won't work.

596
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:20,562
Could you please, just once,
say something-omething positive?

597
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,900
Okay. I'm positive it won't work.

598
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,307
How about
"harmoniously proportioned"?

599
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:30,106
-Harmoniously proportioned, yes!
-Stop that! You're following again.

600
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:33,705
Please, all of you!
What's the perfect word for Wilbur?

601
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,375
How about "delicious"?

602
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,813
Or "nutritious"? Or "extra crispy"?

603
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,415
How about...

604
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:44,091
-Did you get him?
-Yep. Bull's-eye.

605
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,594
How about "terrific, terrific, terrific"?

606
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:49,995
Good. Much too long, though.
I've only got so much web.

607
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,330
But one "terrific" might work.

608
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:56,132
It simply isn't true.
The pig is not terrific.

609
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,402
Look at him! He's absolutely average.

610
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:03,640
If you wish to be truthful,
then that is the word you should write.

611
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:04,975
"Average."

612
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:08,879
Wilbur, this only works
if the word I write is true.

613
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:11,920
And only you can tell us
which word that is.

614
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,319
So look around.

615
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,855
We've all gathered around to help you.

616
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,459
Now tell everyone how you feel.

617
00:43:27,337 --> 00:43:30,135
Look, there's a red one! And a blue one!

618
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:33,201
Avery! You'll never catch me!

619
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,375
I'm going to get you!

620
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,477
Look at the fireworks, Mom!

621
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,978
Avery, come on
if you ever want to catch me!

622
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:00,435
This web thing is really paying off.

623
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,572
Mr. Zuckerman!

624
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:09,271
There it is, side to side,
right in the same place. "Terrific."

625
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:11,478
It was the most amazing thing!

626
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:15,176
Last time we had hundreds of people.
This time it's going to be thousands!

627
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,810
It says "terrific" just as clear as day.

628
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,582
T-E-double-R-l-F-l-C.

629
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:22,123
I mean, can you imagine a spider
being able to spell that word?

630
00:44:22,225 --> 00:44:24,489
I don't think I could spell that word
till the 10th grade.

631
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,399
-Fifty cents.
-Do you like that one, sir?

632
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:39,805
That's going to be $1.

633
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:43,140
-Wow!
-Gather 'round, folks!

634
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,408
Remember, you saw it right here
at Zuckerman's.

635
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,214
And, before you leave, don't forget to
take some of our berries home with you!

636
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,586
-So, you think this might work?
-Nope.

637
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,125
Dare I say it? He looks "terrific."

638
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,194
Look at them all!

639
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:01,422
Yeah. Smile pretty.
I wish geese had teeth.

640
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,000
Been down here since dawn...

641
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:11,674
What are you suggesting? That Fern
has something to do with all this?

642
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:14,943
How else could those words
have gotten into that web?

643
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,681
I know everyone is saying
it's some kind of miracle, but...

644
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,477
But what? You don't think it is?

645
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:23,578
Do you?

646
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,282
The web itself is a miracle.

647
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,624
Wouldn't you agree?

648
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,621
Well, can you spin one?

649
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:36,654
-I can crochet a doily.
-Because someone taught you how.

650
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,467
Nobody teaches a spider.
They just know how to spin a web.

651
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,367
Don't you think that's a miracle?

652
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,576
<i>As summer ended,</i>
<i>so did the excitement about the web.</i>

653
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,843
<i>Charlotte needed to</i>
<i>think of something special.</i>

654
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:57,951
<i>Special enough to change the way</i>
<i>people saw the world,</i>

655
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,088
<i>or at least one pig in the world, anyway.</i>

656
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:06,561
<i>The truth is, Charlotte feared she would</i>
<i>never find a word that could do all that.</i>

657
00:46:07,363 --> 00:46:11,060
<i>And she had to hurry.</i>
<i>Time was running out for her.</i>

658
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:15,737
<i>But once a promise is made,</i>
<i>it needs to be kept.</i>

659
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,370
-Still no web, huh?
-Nope.

660
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,540
I haven't seen one in, I'd say,
at least a month.

661
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:27,374
Funny how you get used to
all those people being around the place.

662
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,713
Kind of quiet without them, isn't it?

663
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,555
I noticed the hinge pin's busted
on the damper in the smokehouse.

664
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:37,216
Want me to order a new one?

665
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,995
Suppose you better.
That's a special order.

666
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,296
Better get a jump on that if we're going
to smoke any ham before the holidays.

667
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,630
We may need another
cord of wood, too.

668
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,930
I'm just going to throw this out here
one more time. "Pig supreme."

669
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:54,635
Oh, Golly!
Now you're just beating a dead horse.

670
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:56,405
-Hey!
-Sorry.

671
00:46:56,512 --> 00:46:59,413
Look, I don't come across
many words in the field,

672
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,949
other than "Hyah!" or "Giddyup!"

673
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,187
But that rat's always dragging in trash
with writing on it.

674
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,346
I agree.

675
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:09,050
It's about time Templeton started
pulling his weight around here

676
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:10,648
instead of just eating it.

677
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,523
I bet he could bring us
some choice words.

678
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:16,622
I've got a choice word for you.
A little word called, "Uh-uh."

679
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,893
Well, that's two words.

680
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,869
And here's a few more.
Negative. No way. Nothing doing.

681
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:24,872
I ain't breaking my back
to try and save "some pig,"

682
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:28,239
no matter how "terrific"
you think the little lunch meat is.

683
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,782
You'll sing a different tune
when he's gone

684
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:40,117
and nobody brings around those
scrumptious buckets of slop.

685
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:43,457
And three, two...

686
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,186
Cue the rat!

687
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,160
Let's get one thing straight.

688
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,096
I don't care about the pig.

689
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:54,092
-What I care about is the slop.
-Of course.

690
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:58,196
And since I'll be at the dump anyway,
and it won't take any extra effort,

691
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,504
maybe, maybe I'll pick something up.

692
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:04,810
You're very kind.

693
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,480
Don't go spreading it around.

694
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:11,486
What? What do you want?

695
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:20,223
You'll need your strength.

696
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,394
Thanks.

697
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,602
<i>But, Dad, I heard them.</i>

698
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,403
I heard them talking
about the smokehouse!

699
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:35,067
He's not your pig anymore.

700
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:36,975
Well, I wouldn't have sold him
in the first place

701
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,411
if I knew this is what
they were gonna do to him.

702
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:41,039
That's what happens
to a pig on a farm, Fern.

703
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:43,916
You know that.

704
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:47,689
I'll see about that.

705
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,891
I've got maybe two, three years
before she can out-argue me.

706
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,662
Then I'm doomed.

707
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,931
And members of our own 4-H Club

708
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:03,199
will have the opportunity to enter
livestock and poultry in the competition.

709
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:05,968
So, in addition to the rides and games,

710
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:08,600
make sure you show them your support,
as well.

711
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:10,770
Any questions? Rita.

712
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,541
Miss Lewis, can I bring my chickens?

713
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:16,049
Your chickens, I'm sure.
Pigs, chickens, horses and cows.

714
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,586
You certainly can,
and I hope you win first prize.

715
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:35,065
How can he be in every cornfield?

716
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,502
It can't be the same guy. It can't be!

717
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:39,573
He's wearing the same hat.

718
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:42,166
I'm telling you, he is following us!

719
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:44,041
I hate that guy.

720
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,506
I have got to get some corn, Elwyn!

721
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,414
All right! All right! All right!
This is crazy.

722
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,510
-There's two of us, right?
-Yeah.

723
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:54,247
Trust me, there's two of us,
and there's only one of him.

724
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:57,053
I don't know, man. He scares me.
He really does.

725
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,720
-Just think about that corn. Corn.
-Yeah.

726
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:00,818
-The corn.
-Corn.

727
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,331
-All right, let's do it!
-Let's do it! Let's do it!

728
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,771
-Abort! Abort! Abort!
-Abort! Abort! Abort!

729
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,936
Man, he is good!
I bet he's laughing at us.

730
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:20,777
Don't look at him!
Don't even give him the satisfaction.

731
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,350
Just think about something else.

732
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,249
-Think about something else.
-Anything.

733
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,844
I think I see a rat.

734
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:29,618
-That's good.
-No, really, I see a rat.

735
00:50:29,725 --> 00:50:34,424
The rat is stealthy. The rat is nimble.
The rat is on the... whoa!

736
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,472
The rat is losing his touch.

737
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,904
-You want to go mess with him?
-Oh, yeah! I've got to peck something.

738
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,671
Rat on three.

739
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:51,940
One, two, three!

740
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:57,947
The rat has been spotted!

741
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,217
The rat is not

742
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,253
enjoying this!

743
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,494
All this for slop?

744
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,472
The rat is desperate. The rat is trapped.

745
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:21,436
The rat needs to stop calling himself
"the rat."

746
00:51:21,544 --> 00:51:25,275
"Find some words." Yeah, right,
the rat will never find words!

747
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,478
Hey, look. Words.

748
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,844
-Hey, is he still in the can?
-He's in the can?

749
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:35,753
Maybe we should give him
some privacy. Always helps me out.

750
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:37,883
No, no, genius, not that can.

751
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,053
Where did he go? I can't see him.

752
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:42,330
All I see is that fruit moving.

753
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:44,956
-What fruit?
-The fruit with the tail!

754
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:47,029
They'll never get me now.

755
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:51,033
-Let's go get him!
-Go get him!

756
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,287
The rat rules!

757
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:14,125
-We're pink!
-Hey, what the... Pink?

758
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:18,393
But that's all right, isn't it? I mean,
black pretty much goes with everything.

759
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:21,902
No, it's not all right.
That rat is going to pay!

760
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,402
"Radiant."

761
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,375
-This might just work.
-Might?

762
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,946
Oh, for the love of Lucy!

763
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:36,544
Here it comes. It did this yesterday.

764
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:39,811
Look that way, everyone!
Right towards that cloud!

765
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:42,322
Good gracious.
Has it always done that?

766
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,915
No, it can't have.

767
00:52:44,026 --> 00:52:47,484
-Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
-Wow!

768
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,390
Oh, yes.

769
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,693
This word will work quite nicely.

770
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,031
Then my work is done.

771
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:56,862
And now for the fruits of my labor.

772
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,703
And the vegetables! And the gravy!

773
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,568
All right, now.

774
00:53:30,072 --> 00:53:31,232
"R."

775
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,707
And stick.

776
00:53:42,251 --> 00:53:44,583
And loop.

777
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:50,516
And...

778
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:54,355
Come on, Charlotte, you can do this.

779
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:57,430
Don't slow down yet.

780
00:54:23,092 --> 00:54:25,822
Welcome to Zuckerman's!
Thank you all for coming.

781
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:28,790
Well, the web says it
better than I ever could.

782
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:33,227
That is some terrific, radiant pig!

783
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:39,664
And for that reason, I've decided
to enter Wilbur into the county fair.

784
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:47,346
Did you hear what they said, Charlotte?
I'm going to the fair!

785
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,910
Going to the fair!

786
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:51,179
Wilbur might just see Christmas
after all.

787
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,618
Is it good? Did we do it?

788
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,713
Yes, Wilbur. It's very good.

789
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:56,447
Now, smile.

790
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,585
The fair, Homer?
What's gotten into you?

791
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:01,458
I don't know, Sis. It just come to me.

792
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:04,089
He's a runt, Homer.
He doesn't stand a chance.

793
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,758
Well done! Never had a doubt!

794
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:09,201
That spider did a heck of a job.
She's a hard worker.

795
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,172
Thank you, Charlotte.
You should take a little bow.

796
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:14,333
And have my beauty steal the show?

797
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:17,412
Now, go on and show them
what a radiant pig can do.

798
00:55:29,425 --> 00:55:31,325
What do you mean
you're not going to the fair?

799
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:34,658
I'm going to get a prize.
Don't you want to be there?

800
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,164
Of course I do, Wilbur, very much.

801
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,461
I'm just not up to traveling
at the moment.

802
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:43,026
-Why not?
-Because I'm expecting.

803
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,973
Expecting what?

804
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,674
"Expecting" means...

805
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,238
I'm expecting you to do fine without me.

806
00:55:50,412 --> 00:55:54,143
You're getting to be a big pig,
and you'll do just great on your own.

807
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:56,178
Okay. I'll miss you.

808
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,293
Come on, Homer, up and at 'em.

809
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:08,026
It's the big day.

810
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:13,901
-Fern?
-Mom!

811
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:16,938
I'm not wearing that.

812
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,843
What the heck is she doing?

813
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:35,687
Bathed in buttermilk.

814
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:44,893
I've had this dream.

815
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:53,500
I've got to say he really is some pig.

816
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,844
That's my buttermilk working.

817
00:56:56,145 --> 00:56:58,136
You sure you want to
go through with this, Homer?

818
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:00,545
If you lose, you're out your entry fee.

819
00:57:00,649 --> 00:57:01,946
He could win, though.

820
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,281
Stranger things
have been happening around here.

821
00:57:04,386 --> 00:57:05,819
If he doesn't win, though?

822
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:08,549
Well, the way I figure it,
even if he does lose,

823
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:11,091
I can make it all back
on the bacon alone.

824
00:57:14,196 --> 00:57:15,891
Wilbur! Wilbur!

825
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:17,354
Do something, Homer.

826
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,457
-What happened?
-I don't know. He just fainted.

827
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:21,334
It's all right, hon.

828
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:22,927
-Lurvy, get some water!
-It's okay, Wilbur.

829
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:26,269
Charlotte, are you feeling-eeling okay?

830
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:31,103
Why is it so hard for that farmer to see
what is right in front of his face?

831
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,681
Look what Wilbur has done
for this farm. Isn't that better than ham?

832
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:37,377
Well, there's only one thing to do,
and I have to be there to do it.

833
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:40,455
Charlotte, you have your babies
to think about now.

834
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:43,548
Yes, I know.
But I made a promise to my friend.

835
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:47,124
A big blue ribbon ought to finally get
the point through that farmer's head.

836
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:49,697
-Easy, Lurvy. Easy.
-Coming through! Coming through!

837
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:51,060
Here we go!

838
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,560
-There we go.
-He's up.

839
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,661
Okay, let's see if he'll get in the crate.

840
00:57:56,772 --> 00:57:58,899
-Buttermilk.
-Templeton?

841
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:02,610
I need you to go with me.
We'll have to find another word,

842
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,269
a really good one.

843
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,506
Sorry, lady.

844
00:58:05,948 --> 00:58:09,145
Comes a time when the rat's got to ask
himself, "What's in it for the rat?"

845
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,583
-He's right. We've been to the fair.
-We have?

846
00:58:11,687 --> 00:58:14,315
Remember? All that garbage there?

847
00:58:14,423 --> 00:58:17,859
Oh, yeah! It's littered with hunks
of chewed-on funnel cakes...

848
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:18,949
How's that?

849
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:22,121
And dribs of ice cream
going sour in the sun.

850
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:26,829
And spitty little cotton candy bits
ground into the mud.

851
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,427
Popcorn, moldy cheese,
half-eaten sandwiches

852
00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:31,563
and sticky-icky-icky candy apples.

853
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,438
Wait!
Go back to the moldy cheese thing.

854
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:36,568
I've never seen
so much disgusting trash!

855
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,544
Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

856
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:39,944
Don't hurt him, Dad!

857
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,109
Nearly made me gag, the stink of it,
especially that deviled egg.

858
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:44,412
You better hurry up, rat.
They're gonna leave you!

859
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,487
Wait for me!

860
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:47,077
-Nice and easy.
-Come on, Wilbur. Good boy.

861
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:50,158
More food than you'll see in a lifetime!

862
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,850
-Bye, Aunt Edith!
-Bye.

863
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,726
Bye, Fern! Bye, Avery!
See you at the fair, guys!

864
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:57,865
Hey, it worked!

865
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:01,261
I think we milked it a little there
at the end, though.

866
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,895
All right. All right, John,
I'll see you over there!

867
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:06,065
Charlotte, you're coming with me!

868
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:08,173
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

869
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:09,869
Thank you for coming.

870
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,779
-Good luck, Wilbur! Win that ribbon!
-Go get 'em, Wilbur!

871
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:17,251
We're going to the fair!

872
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,520
<i>Going to the fair! Going to the fair!</i>

873
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:27,595
-I'm going on the bumper cars.
-So fun!

874
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,979
The sign looks good, Homer.
Nice and even.

875
00:59:44,279 --> 00:59:46,144
All right, there we go.

876
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,212
There you go, Wilbur.

877
00:59:52,921 --> 00:59:55,481
Okay, where's the filth?

878
00:59:56,191 --> 00:59:58,591
Have you heard that good things come
to those who wait?

879
00:59:58,694 --> 01:00:02,460
No, good things come to those
who find it and shove it in their mouth.

880
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:11,071
Don't think I don't know, Fern,

881
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:15,408
that we're all here
because a determined little girl

882
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:17,272
made a promise to a pig.

883
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,740
-Wilbur.
-Sorry.

884
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:22,850
I mean Wilbur.

885
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:27,148
I'm proud of you, honey.

886
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,357
Thanks.

887
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,560
Fern? Avery?

888
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,466
I'm going to give you each 10 tickets
to do as you like out there.

889
01:00:43,572 --> 01:00:44,937
And you have to make them last all day,

890
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,905
so don't go spending them all at once.
Okay?

891
01:00:47,009 --> 01:00:48,237
-Wow!
-All right!

892
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,672
-I'll be right back. Okay.
-Come on!

893
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,248
You're going to win the prize tomorrow.
I know it.

894
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,340
-Everything will be all right.
-Fern, let's go!

895
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,419
Okay.

896
01:01:02,724 --> 01:01:04,021
Oh, my.

897
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:06,526
Is that what we're up against?

898
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:18,534
Excuse me. What is your name?

899
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:24,005
When someone wants to get
your attention,

900
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,240
what is it they call out?

901
01:01:26,615 --> 01:01:27,741
Uncle.

902
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:31,615
Tell me, Uncle,
what is the date of your birth?

903
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,186
Your birthday?

904
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:43,124
For heaven's sake, all I want to know
is if you're a spring pig.

905
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:47,629
Of course. What did you think I was?
A spring chicken?

906
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:53,032
Huge and humorous. Aren't we talented!

907
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,401
Spring chicken.

908
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:05,042
Charlotte, who are you talking to?

909
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:08,453
-The pig next door.
-Should I be worried?

910
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,289
Of course not.
What good would that do?

911
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,823
Whoa!
Have you seen the beast next door?

912
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,398
I think his mama was part hippo.

913
01:02:17,499 --> 01:02:19,797
If I had to name five of the fattest pigs
I've ever seen,

914
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,462
he'd be three of them. He's a shoo-in.

915
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:25,734
Please. That pig is not nearly
as handsome as Wilbur,

916
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,509
or as harmoniously proportioned,

917
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,238
-and not nearly as clean.
-There's a real tiebreaker.

918
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:35,373
We just have to prove that the finest pig
is not necessarily the fattest.

919
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:38,380
And you can do your part, Wilbur,
by getting some rest.

920
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:40,978
-I'm not tired, Charlotte.
-Okay.

921
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,457
Well, could you excuse me
for just a minute, please?

922
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:50,092
All right, Templeton, you're right.
That pig over there is a shoo-in.

923
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,293
So, I need words that are even better
than that pig is fat.

924
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,495
Special words, and lots of them.

925
01:02:55,604 --> 01:02:57,799
How about "pushy" and "demanding"?

926
01:02:57,906 --> 01:02:59,396
Templeton, please!

927
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:01,999
This is our last chance
to save Wilbur's life.

928
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,670
You do realize
I'm just here for the food, right?

929
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,077
Of course.

930
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:23,530
Enjoy the ride.

931
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:25,760
One, please.

932
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:27,831
Must be in the other pocket. Sorry.

933
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:29,528
-One second.
-All right.

934
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,273
Two, please.

935
01:03:58,967 --> 01:04:00,525
Is that Fern up there?

936
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:04,237
Well, I'll be.

937
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:07,172
-She's with a boy.
-She is! She's with a boy!

938
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:11,370
Oh, no.

939
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:14,481
She's with a boy.

940
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:17,879
Manna from heaven!

941
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:27,221
I don't know what this is, but I love it!

942
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:44,403
One-stop slopping.

943
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:51,712
All right.
Let's go get the spider off my back.

944
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,845
How come I'm not in a cornfield, Elwyn?
How come?

945
01:04:54,956 --> 01:04:58,357
Hey, hey.
They got all kinds of corn right here.

946
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,157
You got your popcorn,
caramel corn, candy corn.

947
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:03,595
Stop torturing me!

948
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:07,328
I'm starving here, and now I'm
cross-eyed because of this pink stuff.

949
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,404
If I ever see that rat again...

950
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,366
Words, words, words.

951
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:14,871
"Pork rinds."

952
01:05:15,377 --> 01:05:16,867
That'll draw a crowd.

953
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,777
This looks promising.

954
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:28,048
Hey! That rat!

955
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:30,851
I'm going to get me some rat!

956
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:33,217
Oh, not these birdbrains.

957
01:05:33,328 --> 01:05:34,989
Let's get rid of them once and for all.

958
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,294
...and everything. Rat on three! Three!

959
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:41,735
Wait up, Brooksie! I'm coming with you!

960
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:47,872
Little flamingoes!

961
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,742
Come and get me!

962
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:55,514
-It's scary guy!
-Abort! Abort!

963
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:58,712
Peck him! Peck him, Elwyn!

964
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:05,252
Wait a minute. His eyes are buttons,
and his hair is straw.

965
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,384
This guy ain't real!

966
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:07,689
-He's not?
-No!

967
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:11,232
Oh, yeah! The rat rules! Take that!

968
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,664
Do you know what this means?

969
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:13,860
-Yeah.
-What?

970
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:16,096
We could've had corn!

971
01:06:19,374 --> 01:06:21,274
Well, Your Highness,
you satisfied or what?

972
01:06:21,376 --> 01:06:23,708
'Cause I've got a spitty hunk of
pineapple upside-down cake out there

973
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:24,904
with my name on it.

974
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:26,810
Yes, very satisfied.

975
01:06:27,382 --> 01:06:31,148
Be careful. If you keep this up,
someone might think you care.

976
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:33,215
Gee, I'm all choked up.

977
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,248
Charlotte?

978
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:39,990
If I don't win the prize tomorrow, they're
gonna send me to the smokehouse.

979
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:41,722
You're going to win, Wilbur.

980
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:44,060
And you're going to see
the snows of winter.

981
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,862
I told you, I never break a promise.

982
01:07:05,253 --> 01:07:06,584
Mom?

983
01:07:06,988 --> 01:07:08,853
Will you put these in for me?

984
01:07:12,227 --> 01:07:14,024
You look like a girl!

985
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:16,391
And I still hit like one.

986
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,935
Well, what do you think?

987
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,098
It's a great word. It's just...

988
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:27,367
Just what?

989
01:07:27,509 --> 01:07:30,307
Is it the right word? Is it true?

990
01:07:30,779 --> 01:07:32,110
Because I don't really feel like

991
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,149
I deserve any of the things
you've written about me.

992
01:07:37,285 --> 01:07:39,253
Then it is the perfect word.

993
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,290
The web!

994
01:07:48,296 --> 01:07:49,763
Hey, Wilbur!

995
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,594
"Humble."

996
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,138
Hey, Wilbur.

997
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,834
If that's not a prize-winner,
I don't know what is.

998
01:08:00,942 --> 01:08:02,705
He's going to win this thing, isn't he?

999
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:05,837
Oh, Homer, I can't go up to that
grandstand looking like this.

1000
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:15,813
Homer.

1001
01:08:24,499 --> 01:08:26,023
It's not fair.

1002
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:33,664
Why didn't they tell us
the judging was going to be so early?

1003
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,777
We did our best.

1004
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:43,610
I'll get the truck and take him home.

1005
01:08:44,252 --> 01:08:46,220
I really thought we had a shot.

1006
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:55,660
It's okay. It'll be okay.

1007
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:01,761
I told you. There it is! The web!

1008
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:04,437
Mom...

1009
01:09:07,175 --> 01:09:08,506
What's going on?

1010
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:20,883
It looks like it's "humble."

1011
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:36,031
Excuse me. Thank you.
Coming through. Excuse me.

1012
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:39,806
Mr. Zuckerman!
Could you come with me, please?

1013
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,637
Oh, and bring the pig, too.

1014
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,580
Homer.

1015
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:19,574
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>on behalf of the state of Maine,</i>

1016
01:10:19,681 --> 01:10:22,548
<i>it gives us great pleasure to present</i>

1017
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,484
<i>Zuckerman's famous pig!</i>

1018
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:32,854
<i>Folks! Folks!</i>

1019
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:36,062
<i>I think we all remember</i>
<i>the start of summer,</i>

1020
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:40,464
<i>when the writing appeared on the web</i>
<i>in Mr. Zuckerman's barn.</i>

1021
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:43,861
<i>And now it has happened yet again!</i>

1022
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,134
<i>Which is why the governors of the fair</i>

1023
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:49,039
<i>are honored to present</i>

1024
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,313
<i>this handsome medal.</i>

1025
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:56,874
<i>A token of our amazement</i>
<i>and our appreciation.</i>

1026
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:07,060
I love you, Wilbur.

1027
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,861
<i>Well, what can I say about this pig</i>
<i>that hasn't already been said?</i>

1028
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,306
<i>I know a lot of you folks</i>
<i>have come out to the farm,</i>

1029
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:22,273
<i>and you've seen the words.</i>

1030
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:26,074
<i>A lot of you have asked me,</i>
<i>"How could this have happened?"</i>

1031
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,581
<i>I don't know.</i>

1032
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:30,382
<i>But it has happened</i>

1033
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:36,087
<i>in a time when we really don't see</i>
<i>many miraculous things.</i>

1034
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:38,588
<i>Or maybe we do.</i>

1035
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:42,856
<i>Maybe they're all right there around us,</i>
<i>every day,</i>

1036
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,828
<i>and we just don't know where to look.</i>

1037
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:51,732
<i>There's no denying</i>
<i>that our own little Wilbur,</i>

1038
01:11:52,507 --> 01:11:55,601
<i>he's part of something</i>
<i>that's bigger than all of us.</i>

1039
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:01,614
<i>And life on that farm</i>

1040
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,118
<i>is just a whole lot better with him in it.</i>

1041
01:12:06,254 --> 01:12:09,121
<i>He really is some pig.</i>

1042
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:11,216
Way to go, Wilbur!

1043
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,370
Charlotte, look how happy she is!

1044
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,243
Isn't that great?

1045
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:36,249
Yes, it's wonderful.

1046
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:38,518
Hey, what's that?

1047
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,019
This is my <i>magnum opus.</i>

1048
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,980
What's a magnet opus?

1049
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:47,352
<i>Magnum opus.</i>

1050
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:51,798
It means "great work."
It's a nutrient-filled, waterproof egg sac.

1051
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,268
Really? There's eggs in there?

1052
01:12:54,369 --> 01:12:57,736
My babies, 514 of them.

1053
01:12:57,839 --> 01:13:01,935
Wow! With 514 baby spiders
all over the place,

1054
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,375
it's going to be really radiant
in the barn!

1055
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,813
Wilbur, I'm afraid they're not going to
make it back to the barn.

1056
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:09,884
What?

1057
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,542
What are you talking about?

1058
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,951
You're not going to
leave them here alone, are you?

1059
01:13:14,055 --> 01:13:16,649
I have no choice. I'm languishing.

1060
01:13:17,258 --> 01:13:18,725
What does that mean?

1061
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,627
It means I'm dying.

1062
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:22,255
What?

1063
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,298
You can't die!

1064
01:13:24,465 --> 01:13:27,832
Wilbur, we're born, we live,

1065
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,131
and, when our time comes, we die.

1066
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,902
It's just the natural cycle of life.

1067
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,768
No! No, just climb down.

1068
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:38,107
I'll carry you the rest of the way.

1069
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:41,743
We'll go back to the barn,
and I'll take care of you.

1070
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,249
No, Wilbur.

1071
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:45,876
I don't even have the strength
to climb down.

1072
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,415
You have to.

1073
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:49,852
You've done so much for me!

1074
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:52,421
And it was my great pleasure.

1075
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,920
Please come down, Charlotte.

1076
01:13:55,029 --> 01:13:57,497
Please. There must be
something I can do.

1077
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,725
No, Wilbur.

1078
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,097
Don't you know
what you've already done?

1079
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:02,863
You made me your friend,

1080
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:07,167
and, in doing so, you made a spider
beautiful to everyone in that barn.

1081
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:12,474
I didn't do anything, Charlotte.
You did it all.

1082
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:16,474
No. My webs were no miracle, Wilbur.

1083
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:19,217
I was only describing what I saw.

1084
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,650
The miracle is you.

1085
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:43,340
Templeton!

1086
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:45,472
Charlotte is very sick.

1087
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,544
Yeah, and twisted.

1088
01:14:48,082 --> 01:14:50,949
She's dying! She can't go home with us.

1089
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:53,384
So, I need you to help me
take her egg sac with us.

1090
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,716
Did you say eggs?

1091
01:14:54,822 --> 01:14:57,052
It's an egg sac. And it's right up there,

1092
01:14:57,158 --> 01:14:58,785
and it has her children in it.

1093
01:14:58,893 --> 01:15:02,124
And I can't just leave it here.
What if something happened to them?

1094
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,097
Now, I can't reach it,
so I need you to get it for me.

1095
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,928
And I need you to do it now.

1096
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,502
I don't think I like your tone.

1097
01:15:08,603 --> 01:15:12,334
Can't you just once in your life think
of someone other than yourself?

1098
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,931
-A little further. Keep coming.
-Once? Once?

1099
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,602
Come on.

1100
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:18,008
No, you come on!

1101
01:15:18,279 --> 01:15:21,339
Who got his hindquarters pecked
to make you "radiant," huh?

1102
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:22,916
Templeton, that's who.

1103
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:26,851
And who interrupted the gorging
of a lifetime so you could be "humble"?

1104
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,617
Why, I think it was Templeton!

1105
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:33,216
Templeton! Templeton! Templeton!

1106
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,955
And do I get thanked?

1107
01:15:36,664 --> 01:15:37,722
No!

1108
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:39,561
Well, has it ever occurred to you

1109
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,430
that even a rat
might like a little appreciation?

1110
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:46,564
A little, dare I say, love?

1111
01:15:46,674 --> 01:15:49,404
Do it and you'll get dibs on my slop
for the rest of my life.

1112
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,568
Done.

1113
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:53,044
Hurry! Up in the corner on the ledge.

1114
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:07,923
Templeton!

1115
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:15,194
Come on!

1116
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,969
Thank you, Templeton,

1117
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:29,275
for everything.

1118
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,587
It's okay, just drop it. Hurry!

1119
01:16:45,933 --> 01:16:47,901
Here you go. Here's your medal.

1120
01:16:48,102 --> 01:16:50,627
-In you go.
-Time to go home, Wilbur.

1121
01:16:50,938 --> 01:16:53,372
All right. Close her up, Lurvy.

1122
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:56,936
Okay, easy now.

1123
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:11,922
Goodbye,

1124
01:17:12,827 --> 01:17:14,852
my sweet, sweet Wilbur.

1125
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:19,823
Goodbye, Charlotte.

1126
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,093
I love you.

1127
01:18:08,883 --> 01:18:12,046
Is that our lovely-ovely-ovely
little Wilbur?

1128
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:14,713
-And he's got a medal!
-Strong work, kid.

1129
01:18:14,822 --> 01:18:16,187
He looks so grown up.

1130
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,850
-I always knew he could do it.
-Never had a doubt.

1131
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,518
Welcome home, Wilbur.

1132
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:24,325
Wilbur?

1133
01:18:24,832 --> 01:18:26,197
Where's Charlotte?

1134
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,995
I got a bad feeling, Bits.

1135
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:29,936
Me, too.

1136
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:30,823
<i>Now, that isn't to say</i>
<i>Charlotte was gone forever.</i>

1137
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:33,725
<i>She lived on</i>
<i>in the hearts of those that knew her,</i>

1138
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:36,200
<i>and even those that didn't.</i>

1139
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,700
<i>Something had changed</i>
<i>in Somerset County.</i>

1140
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:44,267
<i>It was as if people knew</i>
<i>they lived in a special place now.</i>

1141
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,976
<i>And, in small ways,</i>
<i>they started being special people,</i>

1142
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,351
<i>a little bit kinder,</i>

1143
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,078
<i>a bit more understanding.</i>

1144
01:19:55,122 --> 01:19:57,488
<i>And the animals felt different, too.</i>

1145
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,153
<i>Closer.</i>

1146
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:04,253
<i>The warmth of their friendship carried</i>
<i>them through the long, cold months.</i>

1147
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:07,893
<i>They showed it</i>
<i>in little gestures of kindness,</i>

1148
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:09,700
<i>unusual patience,</i>

1149
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:12,138
<i>and promises kept.</i>

1150
01:20:14,775 --> 01:20:18,404
<i>Even the hardest of hearts found</i>
<i>themselves rising to the occasion.</i>

1151
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:30,154
<i>And, finally, the greatest promise of all,</i>

1152
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:34,586
<i>a spring pig saw his first snowfall.</i>

1153
01:20:36,297 --> 01:20:39,789
<i>It was as though Charlotte herself</i>
<i>had shaken it out of the sky.</i>

1154
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:15,798
<i>The stillness of winter continued</i>
<i>to the first thaw, like it always does.</i>

1155
01:21:17,538 --> 01:21:19,904
<i>And then, the first buds of spring.</i>

1156
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:26,146
<i>And, before you knew it,</i>
<i>life had come full circle.</i>

1157
01:21:41,595 --> 01:21:43,563
They're here! They're here!

1158
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:45,427
They're here, everybody!

1159
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,133
Hey, there. I'm Wilbur.
I'm a friend of your mom's.

1160
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:52,131
Boy, are we glad to see you!

1161
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:58,043
So creepy!

1162
01:21:58,145 --> 01:22:00,170
And cute! Just like their mother.

1163
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:02,715
They're so, so beautiful.

1164
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:07,085
I just want to scoop them up
and hug them all.

1165
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:09,650
Wow, you can fly!

1166
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:11,821
Look at you go!

1167
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:27,834
Now that is something to follow.

1168
01:22:31,946 --> 01:22:35,507
Go, little spiders! Be free! I wish I could.

1169
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:39,441
I'm kidding, honey.
I think I got one inside my beak.

1170
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:43,919
-Thanks, baby.
-That's my Golly-olly-olly.

1171
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:45,286
Wow!

1172
01:22:45,893 --> 01:22:47,485
I can't believe they're really here.

1173
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:50,792
-So pretty.
-Yeah, Bits.

1174
01:22:51,832 --> 01:22:53,697
You doing okay over there, lke?

1175
01:22:53,801 --> 01:22:56,599
I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it, Bets.

1176
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:58,429
I'm okay with it.

1177
01:22:59,373 --> 01:23:02,308
Spiders are nice. Spiders are my friend.

1178
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:05,303
Spiders won't hurt me.

1179
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:17,155
Wait! What's happening?
What are you doing?

1180
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,089
-Bye!
-Bye!

1181
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:20,817
Please don't go.

1182
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,027
-Goodbye! Bye!
-Wait! Wait!

1183
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,496
Goodbye!

1184
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:29,760
Where are you going?

1185
01:23:30,137 --> 01:23:31,434
We're setting forth.

1186
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:35,236
We take to the breeze.
We go as we please.

1187
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:37,371
We take to the breeze!

1188
01:23:37,611 --> 01:23:38,669
Bye!

1189
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:40,508
But you can't go!

1190
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,377
I had so much I wanted to tell you!

1191
01:23:45,219 --> 01:23:47,619
And someone I wanted to tell you about.

1192
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:56,729
Salutations!

1193
01:23:58,032 --> 01:23:59,829
-Who said that?
-I'm up here.

1194
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:02,035
-So am I.
-Me, too.

1195
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:05,333
-We'd like to stay.
-We like it here.

1196
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,805
And we like you, too.

1197
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:12,538
You're staying? Oh, that's great!
That's really, really great!

1198
01:24:12,913 --> 01:24:15,677
Three friends! What are your names?

1199
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:19,383
I'll tell you my name if you'll tell me
why you're trembling.

1200
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,111
Well, I think I'm trembling with joy.

1201
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:25,283
-Then my name is Joy.
-Joy? Perfect.

1202
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:28,190
-What was my mom's middle initial?
-A.

1203
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:30,889
Then my name is Aranea.

1204
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:32,795
Wow! Great name!

1205
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:34,864
Why don't you pick my name for me?

1206
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:38,370
Something sensible.
Not too long, not too fancy.

1207
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:41,004
And not too dumb.

1208
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:43,201
Tricky. How about

1209
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:45,601
Nellie?

1210
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:48,773
Nellie? I like it. Well done!

1211
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,445
Joy, Aranea, Nellie,

1212
01:24:51,852 --> 01:24:56,186
you have chosen a hallowed doorway
in which to spin your webs.

1213
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:58,749
This was your mother's doorway.

1214
01:24:58,859 --> 01:25:01,953
She was loyal, brilliant, beautiful,

1215
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:03,689
and she was my friend.

1216
01:25:03,797 --> 01:25:06,357
I will treasure her memory forever.

1217
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,864
So, to you, her daughters,
I pledge my friendship.

1218
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:12,737
I pledge mine!

1219
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,967
-I do, too!
-So do I!

1220
01:25:24,985 --> 01:25:28,011
Okay, I'd like to make
a couple of announcements.

1221
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,413
First of all,

1222
01:25:29,523 --> 01:25:31,491
if you gals are word-lovers,

1223
01:25:31,592 --> 01:25:34,186
and you need
a few scraps of paper for inspiration,

1224
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,425
don't look at me.

1225
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:39,597
My word-fetching days are over.

1226
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:44,063
I'm not the rat I used to be.
I'm at least twice that.

1227
01:25:45,105 --> 01:25:48,006
So, if you need something to write,
try this,

1228
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:51,037
"Some rat." Some rat.

1229
01:25:51,478 --> 01:25:52,570
Think about it.

1230
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,843
Slops! Oh, yeah!

1231
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:02,421
<i>And, in an ordinary barn,</i>

1232
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,890
<i>an ordinary pig, a runt no less,</i>

1233
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:09,828
<i>stood surrounded by friends,</i>

1234
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:14,260
<i>welcoming his second spring.</i>

1235
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:19,034
<i>And that spring was followed by many,</i>
<i>many more.</i>

1236
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,168
<i>All because someone stopped to see</i>
<i>the grace</i>

1237
01:26:23,677 --> 01:26:27,704
<i>and beauty and nobility</i>
<i>of the humblest creature.</i>

1238
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:32,519
<i>That is the miracle of friendship.</i>

1239
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:35,984
<i>It is not often</i>
<i>that someone comes along</i>

1240
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:38,786
<i>who is a true friend and a good writer.</i>

1241
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:42,352
<i>Charlotte was both.</i>
