1
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,520
M doesn't mind you earning\Na little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,390
She'd just prefer it\Nif it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,100
If the theatrics\Nare supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,800
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,370
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,510
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,920
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,780
...l'd know if anyone had been\Npromoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,280
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,880
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes--\N-Two.

11
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
Shame.

12
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,510
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,740
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,780
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,150
True.

16
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,390
How did he die?

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,060
Your contact?

18
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,760
Not well.

19
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,710
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,950
Well...

21
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,380
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,510
The second is--

23
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,330
Yes.

24
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,190
Considerably.

25
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,400
So how do I trust this man\Nthat I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,170
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,600
That's all my organization\Nwill guarantee.

28
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,680
I suppose our friend\NMr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,150
...that I have provided\Nreliable banking services...

30
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,050
...for many other\Nfreedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,130
Do you believe in God,\NMr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,960
No.

33
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,830
I believe in\Na reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,300
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,770
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,770
And I can access it\Nanywhere in the world?

37
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,170
Yes.

38
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,360
I have the money,\Nso short another million shares...

39
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,220
{\i1}...of Skyfleet stock.{\i0}

40
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,300
Sir, you must know you're betting\Nagainst the market.

41
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,670
No one expects this stock\Nto go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,570
Just do it.

43
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,810
Looks like our man.\NBurn scars on his face.

44
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,010
I wonder if bomb-makers\Nare insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,270
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,370
He's on the move,\Nand he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,260
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,530
-Sorry?\N-Put your hand down.

49
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,510
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.\NI need him alive.

50
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,660
Weeping blood comes merely\Nfrom a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,260
...my dear general.

52
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,490
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,130
All in.

54
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,060
I have two pair, and you have\Na 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,370
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,140
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,500
-We have less than 36 hours. I can--\N-No. No, no.

58
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,440
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,380
Give our guests\Nfive minutes to leave...

60
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,880
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,190
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,890
I report to the prime minister,\Neven he's smart enough...

63
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,300
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,200
Have you ever seen such a bunch\Nof self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,210
They don't care what we do, they care\Nwhat we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,070
And how the hell\Ncould Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,150
I give him double-0 status,\Nhe celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,750
Is the man deranged?\NAnd where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,480
In the old days, if an agent\Ndid something embarrassing...

70
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,310
...he'd have the good sense\Nto defect.

71
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,350
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,630
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,330
Sorry.

74
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,340
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,200
Or yourself.

76
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,430
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,170
You violated the only\Nabsolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,970
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,120
And why?\NSo you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,010
We wanted to question him,\Nnot kill him.

81
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,420
For God's sake. You're supposed\Nto display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,680
I did.

83
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,880
I thought one less bomb-maker\Nin the world would be good.

84
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,890
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,920
We're trying to find out how an entire\Nnetwork of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,620
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,960
Hardly the big picture,\Nwouldn't you say?

88
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,400
The man isn't even a true believer.\NHe's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,440
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,510
...we have no idea\Nwho hired him or why.

91
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,050
And how the hell\Ndid you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,840
The same way\NI found out your name.

93
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,990
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.\NI had no idea it stood for--

94
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,660
Utter one more syllable\Nand I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,850
I knew it was too early\Nto promote you.

96
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,330
Well, I understand double-0s\Nhave a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,730
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,880
Bond, this may be too much\Nfor a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,450
...but arrogance and self-awareness\Nseldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,780
So you want me to be half monk,\Nhalf hit-man?

101
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,850
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,460
I want you to take your ego\Nout of the equation...

103
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,180
...and to judge the situation\Ndispassionately.

104
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,160
I have to know I can trust you,\Nand that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,990
And since I don't know that,\NI need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,230
Go and stick your head\Nin the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,800
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,910
Because these bastards\Nwant your head.

109
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,570
And I'm seriously considering\Nfeeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,910
And Bond...

111
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,920
...don't ever break into\Nmy house again.

112
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,800
Ma'am.

113
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,340
Good day, sir,\Nand welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,580
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,390
Hello.

116
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,720
Are you going to take this\Nor make me wait?

117
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,230
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,580
{\i1}Security to car park.\NSecurity to car park.{\i0}

119
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,480
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,070
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.\NChecking in?

121
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,720
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment\Nthing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,320
Okay.

123
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,190
-We have an ocean-view villa.\N-Perfect.

124
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,560
Could you do me a favor?\NI was here last night...

125
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,720
...and I parked my car next to\Na very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,030
I nicked the door.\NYou wouldn't happen to know--?

127
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,670
-Mr. Dimitrios.\N-Right.

128
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,610
If he hasn't noticed,\NI'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,510
Isn't the type\Nto take bad news well.

130
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,350
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,610
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,550
Thank you.

133
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,350
-What?\N-He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,990
You woke me\Nto share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,160
Well, he's logged into\Nour secure website...

136
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,420
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,490
Well, how the hell\Ndoes he know these things?

138
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,060
{\i1}Well, I'm doing my best to find out.{\i0}

139
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,130
{\i1}-Who's he looking at?\N-Alex Dimitrios.{\i0}

140
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,160
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,650
Now known associates....

142
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,800
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,880
We've had a good night,\Nwe've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,550
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,980
Good evening.\NLarge Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,820
-Look what just happened.\N-Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,250
Yeah.

148
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,100
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,530
-Oh, good evening. How are you?\N-Good evening.

150
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,120
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm in.

152
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,080
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,520
If that was for luck,\Nyou're two hours late.

154
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,360
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,500
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,200
I heard you.

157
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,600
Five to call.

158
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,510
-Action's to you.\N-Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,080
Ace high.

160
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,220
Check or bet.

161
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,910
-Check.\N-And to you.

162
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,060
Five thousand.

163
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,460
Five to call.

164
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,670
-Check.\N-Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,670
All in.

166
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,140
No, wait.

167
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,020
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,750
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,350
Okay. This is on the table.\NThat's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,890
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,090
Please, no. Give him a chance\Nto win his money back.

172
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,040
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,480
Three kings.

174
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,420
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,020
Trip aces.

176
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,320
Aces win.

177
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,360
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,140
Thank you.

179
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,810
Sir.

180
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,310
-Thank you.\N-Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,510
No wonder he was\Nin such a foul mood.

182
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,940
My mistake.

183
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,410
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,450
That would really send him\Nover the edge.

185
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,590
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,880
Well, perhaps you're just\Nout of practice.

187
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,960
Perhaps.

188
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,900
Well, what about\Na drink at my place?

189
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Your place?

190
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,070
-Is it close?\N-Very.

191
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,350
One drink.

192
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,270
Good evening, sir,\Nand welcome back.

193
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,380
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,690
{\i1}I'm having a hard time seeing\Nhow this is my fault.{\i0}

195
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,560
It's your plan.\NAll I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,260
A man who was under surveillance\Nby the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,540
Which makes me wonder\Nif I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,310
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,480
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,680
I have someone else\Nwilling to do the job.

201
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,280
...and payment.

203
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,890
You like married women,\Ndon't you, James?

204
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,300
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,040
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,210
You, my husband....

207
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,080
I had so many chances\Nto be happy...

208
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,650
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,550
Why can't nice guys\Nbe more like you?

210
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,990
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,190
Yes.

212
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,760
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,640
What makes your husband\Na bad man?

214
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,400
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,270
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,140
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:30,120
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me\Nin order to get to him.

218
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,790
How afraid?

219
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,160
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,900
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,230
Now would seem\Nan appropriate time.

222
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,810
Does "ellipsis"\Nmean anything to you?

223
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,120
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,650
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,790
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,890
{\i1}I'm on the last flight\Ntonight to Miami.{\i0}

227
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,720
{\i1}Don't wait up.\NI'll be back in the morning.{\i0}

228
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,260
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,230
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,180
Apparently he's on\Nthe last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,540
...so you have all night\Nto question me.

232
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,850
In that case...

233
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,180
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,750
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,060
{\i1}Good evening. Room Service.{\i0}

236
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,060
Good evening. Can I get a bottle\Nof chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,500
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,170
{\i1}-With everything?\N-Yes, with everything.{\i0}

239
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,460
{\i1}-And would that be for two, sir?\N-What?{\i0}

240
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,940
{\i1}-For two?\N-No, for one.{\i0}

241
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,770
Wait here.

242
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,010
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,360
{\i1}Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds\Ninvites visitors...{\i0}

244
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,390
{\i1}...to observe the body's various\Nlocomotive, digestive...{\i0}

245
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,360
{\i1}...nervous and vascular systems.{\i0}

246
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,360
{\i1}Please may I have your attention,\Nladies and gentlemen?{\i0}

247
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,260
{\i1}I believe it is something very special,\Nwhat we see here.{\i0}

248
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,630
{\i1}This is edutainment.{\i0}

249
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,150
{\i1}--fixed in dramatic\Nand athletic poses...{\i0}

250
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,230
{\i1}...that reveal the true-to-life spatial\Nrelationships amongst organs.{\i0}

251
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,900
Hello.

252
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,020
Hello.

253
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:06,190
{\i1}Do not leave your vehicle unattended.{\i0}

254
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,960
{\i1}Welcome to Miami\NInternational Airport.{\i0}

255
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,290
{\i1}Curbside parking in front\Nof the terminal is restricted....{\i0}

256
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,290
-Yes.\N-It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,230
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.\NCan I take a message?

258
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,700
Listen, you go and find her, tell her\Nto call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,470
...because I think a bomb is about\Nto go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,610
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?\N-I thought you might.

261
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,780
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,610
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,750
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.\N-What about it?

264
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,180
"The largest airplane in the world will\Nbe unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:24,620
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:26,420
{\i1}Bond? Bond!{\i0}

267
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,530
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,670
{\i1}It's launching today.{\i0}

269
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,870
I gotta go.

270
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,940
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,570
Get moving!\NLet's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,470
The puts expired. I'm sorry,\NI'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:53,070
One hundred and one million,\Ntwo hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,780
Someone talked.

275
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,510
-You got everything you need?\N-Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,770
I'm gonna get a few more photos....

277
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,190
Quite the body count\Nyou're stacking up.

278
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,730
She was tortured first.\NAs you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,560
...she must have been\Nthe only one left to question.

280
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,360
Did she know anything\Nthat could compromise you?

281
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,540
No.

282
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,200
-Not your name, what you were after?\N-No.

283
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,840
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,810
Knew where to put his hands\Non weapons...

285
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,450
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:08,280
He worked with anyone\Nwho had money.

287
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,850
For years he was involved with a man\Nwe knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,960
...a private banker\Nto the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,620
He invested their money, gave them\Naccess to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,590
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,360
Albanian, we believe.\NChess prodigy.

292
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:27,130
A bit of a mathematical genius\Nand liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,890
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,730
Yes.

295
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,770
{\i1}When they analyzed\Nthe stock market after 9l11...{\i0}

296
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,280
...the CIA discovered a massive\Nshorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,310
{\i1}When the stocks hit bottom on 9l12,\Nsomebody made a fortune.{\i0}

298
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,580
The same thing happened\Nthis morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,020
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,990
With their prototype destroyed, the\Ncompany would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:29,220
Instead, somebody lost over\N$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,130
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,270
Which would explain how he could\Nset up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,170
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:41,430
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,\N5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,410
Winner takes all.\NPotentially 150 million.

307
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,170
Good.\NThen we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,350
Do you want a clean kill\Nor to send a message?

309
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,820
We want him alive. Le Chiffre\Ndoesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,420
Has he been playing the stock market\Nwith his clients' funds?

311
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,460
They're not gonna be too happy\Nwhen they find out it's gone.

312
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,030
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,460
If he loses,\Nhe'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,500
We'll give him sanctuary\Nin return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,430
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,300
...replacing someone\Nwho's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,070
According to Villiers,\Nyou're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,310
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:27,290
I would ask you if you could remain\Nemotionally detached...

320
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,650
...but I don't think\Nthat's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,190
No.

322
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,890
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,430
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,000
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,900
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,\Ndidn't you?

326
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,370
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:07,620
Thank you.

328
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm the money.

329
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,570
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:24,100
The Treasury has agreed\Nto stake you in the game.

331
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,140
"Vesper."

332
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,840
Well, I do hope you gave\Nyour parents hell for that.

333
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,050
Thank you.

334
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,920
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,560
I've never seen so much\Ngo out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,790
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,330
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,060
Ten million was wired\Nto your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:49,600
...with a contingency for 5 more\Nif I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,830
I suppose you've given some thought\Nto the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,940
...our government\Nwill have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,710
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,760
So you're telling me it's a matter\Nof probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,930
I was worried there was\Nsome chance involved.

345
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,790
Well, only if you assume the player\Nwith the best hand wins.

346
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,230
So that would be\Nwhat you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,100
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,800
Then you'll also know that in poker\Nyou never play your hand.

349
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:27,370
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,940
-And you're good at reading people?\N-Yes, I am.

351
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,840
Which is why\NI've been able to detect...

352
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,180
...an undercurrent\Nof sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,750
I'm now assured our money\Nis in good hands.

354
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,020
You don't think\Nthis is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,710
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,490
I got the impression\Nwe were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,930
...and hundreds of lives\Non a game of luck.

358
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,160
What else can you surmise,\NMr. Bond?

359
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,530
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,330
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
You worry you won't\Nbe taken seriously.

362
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,000
Which one can say of any\Nattractive woman with half a brain.

363
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,770
True, but this one\Novercompensates...

364
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,810
...by wearing\Nslightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:06,380
...being more aggressive\Nthan her female colleagues...

366
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,050
...which gives her a somewhat\Nprickly demeanor...

367
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,580
...and ironically enough, makes it\Nless likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,980
...and promoted\Nby her male superiors...

369
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,960
...who mistake her insecurities\Nfor arrogance.

370
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,490
Now, I'd have normally\Ngone with only child...

371
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,790
...but, you see, by the way you ignored\Nthe quip about your parents...

372
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,660
...l'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,570
All right.

374
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,000
By the cut of your suit,\Nyou went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,580
...and actually think\Nhuman beings dress like that.

376
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,680
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,780
...my guess is\Nyou didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,550
...and your school friends\Nnever let you forget it.

379
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,690
Which means you were\Nat that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,760
...of someone else's charity,\Nhence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,450
And since your first thought about me\Nran to orphan...

382
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,650
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,590
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,900
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,870
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,480
...since Ml6 looks\Nfor maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,940
...that give little thought\Nto sacrificing others...

388
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:14,340
...in order to protect\NQueen and country.

389
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,640
You know...

390
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,790
...former SAS types with easy smiles\Nand expensive watches.

391
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,660
-Rolex?\N-Omega.

392
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,690
Beautiful.

393
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,860
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,900
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you\Na cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,460
No, of course not.

396
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,360
But it wouldn't be a stretch\Nto imagine.

397
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,730
You think of women\Nas disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,030
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,640
So as charming as you are,\NMr. Bond...

400
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,280
...I will be keeping my eye\Non our government's money...

401
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,450
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,440
You noticed?

403
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,640
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,180
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,150
Skewered.

406
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,980
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,320
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,860
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,350
-Hotel Splendid, sir?\N-That's right.

410
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,850
-Thank you, sir.\N-Thank you.

411
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,170
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,600
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,310
Do you usually leave it to porters\Nto tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,210
Only when the romance\Nhas been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,580
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,\Nprofessional gambler...

416
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,340
...and you're\NMiss Stephanie Broadchest--

417
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,750
-I am not.\N-You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,920
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,020
We've been involved\Nfor quite a while...

420
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,380
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,960
But my family\Nis strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,890
...so for appearances' sake,\Nit'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:14,360
I do hate it when religion\Ncomes between us.

424
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,060
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,240
Am I going to have a problem\Nwith you, Bond?

426
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,200
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,530
Smart?

428
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,840
Single.

429
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,050
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.\NYour name, sir?

430
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,130
James Bond. You'll find\Nthe reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:53,060
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.\N-You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,040
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,040
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,840
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,010
Very funny.

436
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,190
Look, if Le Chiffre\Nis that well-connected...

437
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,290
...he knows who I am\Nand where the money's from.

438
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:15,890
Which means he's decided\Nto play me anyway.

439
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,460
So he's either desperate\Nor he's overly confident...

440
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,960
...but either way, that tells me\Nsomething about him.

441
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,690
And all he gets in return\Nis a name he already has.

442
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,630
And now he knows\Nsomething about you.

443
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,030
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,470
Take the next one.

445
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:33,540
There isn't enough room for me\Nand your ego.

446
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,500
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,040
-It was left for you.\N-Thank you.

448
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,700
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:55,090
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.\NI'm your contact here.

450
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,150
Does he know\Nwe've been watching him?

451
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,030
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:07,570
Probably because there's no "we."\NJust me.

453
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,170
I'm afraid if you get\Ninto trouble here...

454
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:14,100
...the cavalry won't be\Ncoming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,440
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,410
...and spent the time reestablishing\Nold relationships.

457
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,950
The chief of police and he\Nare now quite close.

458
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,060
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,820
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,090
Well, that could make life\Nquite difficult.

461
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,260
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,090
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,460
I thought about trying to buy\Nhis services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,870
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,140
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:57,310
...but the accountants seem\Nto be running Ml6 these days.

467
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:01,590
Oh, not that I have anything\Nagainst accountants.

468
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:04,060
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,690
So I decided that it was cheaper\Nto supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,490
...with evidence\Nthat we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,040
It's amazing what you can do with\NPhotoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,600
I think your odds are improving,\NMr. Bond.

473
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,450
Yes?

474
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,780
For you.

475
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,450
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,260
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,760
So when you walk up behind me\Nand kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,330
...the players will be thinking\Nabout your neckline...

479
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,260
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,870
Do you think you can\Ndo that for me?

481
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,010
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,010
Thank you.

483
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,250
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,790
There are dinner jackets\Nand dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,150
This is the latter.

486
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,560
And I need you looking like a man\Nwho belongs at that table.

487
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,630
How--?

488
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,900
It's tailored.

489
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,660
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,990
-Good evening, sir.\N-Good evening.

491
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,590
Thank you.

492
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,500
And you must be\NMr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,810
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,810
Or is that Bond?\NI'm a little confused.

495
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,450
Well, we wouldn't want that,\Nwould we?

496
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,890
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,690
As you know, the game is no-limit\Nhold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,840
Five communal cards,\Ntwo in the hole.

499
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,070
Monsieur Mendel here represents\Nthe Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,500
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:10,340
You have each deposited\N$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:13,450
A further buy-in of 5 million\Ncan be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,740
The money will remain in escrow\Nuntil I return...

504
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:18,680
...and the winner of the contest\Nenters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,050
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,990
...whereupon the entire sum\Nwill be wired...

507
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:24,320
...to any bank account\Nin the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,620
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,220
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,870
Please be so kind as to enter\Na password of your choice.

511
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,440
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,190
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,530
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,760
Mr. Kaminofsky is\Nthe small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:11,430
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,\N$ 10,000.

516
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,570
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,530
Four players.

518
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,470
It's your bet.

519
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,480
Check.

520
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,470
Check.

521
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,840
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:10,330
Call.

523
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,870
Fold.

524
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,470
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:25,210
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,290
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,390
Weren't you supposed to enter\Nso the others could see you?

528
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,630
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,370
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:57,580
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:00,740
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,610
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?\NA hundred thousand?

533
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,150
Call.

534
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,450
Hello.

535
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,260
I suppose I don't have to tell you\Nhow beautiful you look.

536
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,590
Half the people at that table\Nare still watching you.

537
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,770
Champagne.

538
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,340
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,720
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,890
Monsieur, you have been called.\NShowdown, please.

541
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:53,730
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.\NDeuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,730
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,970
Fold.

544
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,680
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,630
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,530
Three measures Gordon's,\None of vodka...

547
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,560
...half of Kina Lillet,\Nshake it over ice...

548
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,600
-...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.\N-Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,670
-You know, I'll have one of those.\N-So will I.

550
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,870
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,710
My friend, bring me one as well.\NKeep the fruit.

552
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,910
That's it?

553
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,810
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,180
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,130
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,980
You taste nice.

557
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:13,110
-I thought we dispensed with covers.\N-No.

558
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,010
We dispensed with one that was\Nof no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,740
-Is he watching?\N-Yes.

560
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,010
Good.

561
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,990
This is me in character pissed off\Nbecause you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,960
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,130
Oddly, my character's feelings\Nmirror my own.

564
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,320
Check.

565
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,800
-You know, that's not half bad.\N-Up to you.

566
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,900
I'm gonna have to think up\Na name for that.

567
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,000
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,600
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:43,000
The twitch he has to hide\Nwhen he bluffs.

570
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:47,340
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.\N-Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,750
The odds against were 23-to-1,\Nand he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,920
When he did his first raise\Nhe had nothing.

573
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,650
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,690
-Did you get the bug?\N-Yes.

575
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,760
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,480
Thank you.

577
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,730
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,960
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,240
Call.

580
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,810
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,870
Ladies and gentlemen,\NMesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,840
...we've now been\Nplaying for four hours.

583
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:23,510
It's time for a short break.\NWe will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:58,120
Well, I think I'll report\Non the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,590
So?

586
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,920
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:05,460
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:08,600
You just said you can't wait\Nto get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,180
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:40,220
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,660
Where is my money?

592
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,400
-Good evening.\N-Good evening.

593
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:52,840
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,140
Thank you.

595
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,580
Do you think you can lose that kind\Nof money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,920
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,450
Open that.

598
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,530
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,780
All of it.

600
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:48,220
I would take a hand for this betrayal,\Nbut you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,500
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,570
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,800
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,650
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,970
Stairs.

606
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,100
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:37,270
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,130
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:44,570
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here\Nand I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,800
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,230
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:57,270
I hope our little game\Nisn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,710
A little.

614
01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:02,480
But I won't consider myself to be\Nin trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:06,710
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's\Nready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:12,320
It's like there's blood on my hands.\NIt's not coming off.

617
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,220
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:32,640
That's better.

619
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,040
You cold?

620
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,650
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,750
Here.

622
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,740
You have any trouble\Nwith the bodies?

623
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,240
Less than some.

624
01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:00,760
Being dead doesn't mean\None can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,390
That'll keep Le Chiffre\Nlooking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,830
He'll be wondering who's gonna\Ncome for him next.

627
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:10,700
How's our girl?

628
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:14,440
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,560
Call.

630
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,160
Fold.

631
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,330
And call.

632
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:40,690
Three players.

633
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:46,070
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,940
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:51,470
Call.

636
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,180
And call.

637
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,650
Three players.

638
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:05,980
Check.

639
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,660
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,980
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:40,960
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,190
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,230
It's up to you.

644
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,770
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,220
Seems someone knows\Nsomething I don't.

646
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,450
Fold.

647
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,420
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,180
It's up to you.

649
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,840
Two.

650
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:28,700
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,740
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:45,690
I'm all in.

653
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,470
Well, it's 14 million\Nand 500,000.

654
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:58,000
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,010
Bond will have to go all in\Nto call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,680
-Call.\N-Call.

657
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,480
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:15,620
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,850
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:34,500
It's four jacks.\NMonsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:41,680
You must have thought\NI was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,510
Please.

663
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,020
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,550
When we return,\Nthe big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,660
Good game.

666
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,130
Well, I'm gonna need the other\N5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,030
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:35,970
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:39,760
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,\Nbut I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,410
-I'm sorry.\N-Sorry?

671
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,910
Sorry?

672
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:45,880
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,480
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,010
...continue funding terror and killing."\NThat kind of sorry?

675
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:53,280
You lost because of your ego,\Nand that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,890
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,060
All you're going to do now\Nis lose more.

678
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,850
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:01,930
-I'm sorry?\N-I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:06,100
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,630
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,870
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:37,930
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:40,930
-Shaken or stirred?\N-Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,390
-James.\N-Get the girl out.

686
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,630
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:12,930
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,\Nseeing as we're related.

688
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:16,760
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,170
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,870
If you keep your head about you,\NI think you have him.

691
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,340
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,710
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,780
No.

694
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,060
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.\NI'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,920
You have a better chance.\NI'll stake you.

696
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,090
I'm saying I'll give you the money\Nto keep going.

697
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:49,170
Just one thing. If you pull it off,\Nthe CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:52,870
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,140
Does it look like\Nwe need the money?

700
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,780
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:13,690
Why not?

702
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:18,660
Bet.

703
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,400
Raise.

704
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,850
And fold.

705
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:44,060
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,390
Call.

707
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,090
Raise.

708
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,760
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:58,210
-Fold.\N-Thank you.

710
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,740
Fold.

711
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:07,540
Fold.

712
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:13,890
Thank you.

713
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:15,060
Wins.

714
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:37,340
Deal me out.

715
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:41,470
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,010
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,520
-Who is it?\N-It's 007.

718
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:55,750
Bond's been poisoned.\NHe's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,360
Stay calm and don't interrupt.\NBecause you'll be dead...

720
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,190
...within two minutes\Nunless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,660
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:06,390
Remove the defibrillator\Nfrom the pouch.

723
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,930
{\i1}-Do we know what it is yet?\N-We're still scanning.{\i0}

724
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:17,310
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,920
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,020
What do we give him? The kit\Nhas amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:32,850
{\i1}...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?{\i0}

728
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,790
{\i1}-As soon as it reads charged--\N-Lidocaine. That'll work.{\i0}

729
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,470
Bond, don't push the red button yet.\NDo you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:40,100
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,670
{\i1}There's only time for one charge\Nbefore he passes out.{\i0}

732
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:47,540
Take the blue combipen, Bond.\NMid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:50,040
{\i1}That'll counteract the digitalis.{\i0}

734
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,150
You're going to pass out\Nin a few seconds.

735
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,780
You need to keep\Nyour heart going.

736
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,210
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:06,760
-Bond, push the damn button!\N-Do it now!

738
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,610
-You okay?\N-Me?

739
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:02,540
-Thank you.\N-You're welcome.

740
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:06,410
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.\N-I will do.

741
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:08,820
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:11,750
You're not seriously\Ngoing back there?

743
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:16,230
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:19,460
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,760
-All in.\N-Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:27,570
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,480
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:37,850
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:50,390
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:55,430
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,\Nwe enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,400
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:00,800
The big blind is now\N1 million dollars.

754
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,010
Four players.

755
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,180
It's your bet.

756
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:18,390
-Monsieur Bond?\N-Check.

757
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:22,430
-Check.\N-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:27,430
Check. And check.

759
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,460
All check.

760
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,000
Four players.

761
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:37,410
-Check.\N-Check.

762
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,480
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,910
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,690
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:59,460
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:08,310
Raise.

767
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:11,070
Raise.

768
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,540
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:48,270
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,550
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,030
Well, I think I will call you\Non that one.

772
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,080
Call.

773
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,160
One hundred and fifteen million\Nin the pot.

774
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:42,100
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,670
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:59,240
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:19,530
A higher full house.

778
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,210
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:28,410
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:47,960
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:49,640
A straight flush.

782
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,130
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:53,430
The high hand.

784
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:59,670
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,980
-For you.\N-Thank you very much.

786
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:06,610
Congratulations.

787
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:10,350
-He's all yours.\N-Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:18,490
Congratulations.

789
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,560
You know,\NI think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:23,290
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:27,160
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:39,450
Thank you.

793
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:50,960
Mathis says the Americans\Nhave made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:53,790
They're going to extract him\Nbefore dawn.

795
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,470
You know, I think\NI'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:59,670
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:04,040
No. Because once you've tasted it,\Nthat's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:09,740
-I thought that was quite a good line.\N-It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:12,480
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:17,090
-Not so much it as you.\N-Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,960
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,670
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:33,070
Really? I thought it was\Njust something pretty.

804
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,900
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:37,280
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,710
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:52,060
You can switch off so easily,\Ncan't you?

808
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:54,620
It doesn't bother you,\Nkilling those people?

809
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:58,260
Well, I wouldn't be very good\Nat my job if it did.

810
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,430
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:04,230
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:06,030
Just because\Nyou've done something...

813
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,370
...doesn't mean\Nyou have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,480
Why is it people who can't take advice\Nalways insist on giving it?

815
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,650
You think I can't take\Nmy own advice?

816
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:17,210
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:19,780
And I think I'll never find out\Nwhat that is.

818
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,850
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:28,530 --> 01:45:29,790
Good night.

820
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,330
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,450
Mathis.

822
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:48,330
I'm afraid your friend Mathis\Nis really...

823
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,400
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:35,839
Wow..! You've taken good care\Nof your body.

825
01:49:41,086 --> 01:49:43,502


826
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,040
You know...

827
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:54,531
...I never understood\Nall these elaborate tortures.

828
01:49:54,741 --> 01:49:56,941
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:49:57,151 --> 01:50:00,671
...to cause more pain\Nthan a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:02,181 --> 01:50:03,342
And of course...

831
01:50:03,552 --> 01:50:06,522
...it's not only the immediate agony,\Nbut the knowledge...

832
01:50:06,722 --> 01:50:09,382
...that if you do not yield\Nsoon enough...

833
01:50:10,092 --> 01:50:13,723
...there will be little left\Nto identify you as a man.

834
01:50:19,803 --> 01:50:21,704
The only question remains...

835
01:50:23,204 --> 01:50:25,374
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:27,444 --> 01:50:30,575
I want the money.

837
01:50:49,307 --> 01:50:52,737
Miss Lynd will give me the account\Nnumber, if she hasn't already.

838
01:50:52,937 --> 01:50:55,307
So all I need from you\Nis the password.

839
01:51:05,088 --> 01:51:08,319
The password, please.

840
01:51:12,559 --> 01:51:14,859
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:15,069 --> 01:51:16,930
...down there.

842
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:19,170
Would you mind?

843
01:51:26,911 --> 01:51:30,311
No! No! No!

844
01:51:31,281 --> 01:51:34,982
No. To the right.\NTo the right. To the right!

845
01:51:35,192 --> 01:51:37,622
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:39,562 --> 01:51:41,052
Yeah!

847
01:51:42,292 --> 01:51:45,593
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:51:51,273 --> 01:51:56,714
Now the whole world's gonna know\Nthat you died scratching my balls.

849
01:51:58,014 --> 01:52:00,004
I died?

850
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:01,515
-I died?\N-Yes.

851
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:04,685
Because no matter what you do,\NI'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:06,715
Which means your clients\Nwill hunt you down...

853
01:52:06,925 --> 01:52:09,755
...and cut you into pieces of meat\Nwhile you're still breathing.

854
01:52:09,955 --> 01:52:11,356
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:11,566 --> 01:52:13,626
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:13,836 --> 01:52:16,626
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:16,836 --> 01:52:19,827
Because even after I slaughtered\Nyou and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:20,037 --> 01:52:22,837
...your people would still welcome me\Nwith open arms...

859
01:52:24,377 --> 01:52:28,007
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:29,248 --> 01:52:31,308
The big picture.

861
01:52:39,229 --> 01:52:41,459
Give me the password...

862
01:52:41,659 --> 01:52:43,599
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,360
Bond. Do it soon enough\Nand she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:03,451 --> 01:53:05,582
You really aren't going to tell me,\Nare you?

865
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,582
No.

866
01:53:09,422 --> 01:53:11,322
So I think...

867
01:53:15,863 --> 01:53:19,303
...l'll feed you\Nwhat you seem not to value.

868
01:53:32,454 --> 01:53:34,715
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:38,115
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:38,325 --> 01:53:42,786
Money isn't as valuable to our\Norganization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:06,418 --> 01:54:07,818
Francesco.

872
01:54:08,758 --> 01:54:10,659
Francesco.

873
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:25,500
Vesper.

874
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:29,281
Vesper.

875
01:54:31,421 --> 01:54:32,941
No.

876
01:54:33,751 --> 01:54:35,081
Not him.

877
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:37,192
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:39,022 --> 01:54:40,182
No.

879
01:54:41,032 --> 01:54:43,052
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:45,833 --> 01:54:47,633
Not him.

881
01:54:49,533 --> 01:54:50,693
Any ideas?

882
01:54:54,443 --> 01:54:58,274
-What?\N-Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:00,284 --> 01:55:01,714
Where is she?

884
01:55:02,754 --> 01:55:04,655
Sleeping.

885
01:55:05,255 --> 01:55:08,515
Well, I'm supposed\Nto get you to drink this.

886
01:55:09,625 --> 01:55:11,285
It's just odd...

887
01:55:11,495 --> 01:55:15,396
...killing everyone else\Nbut leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:15,596 --> 01:55:18,936
Almost as if someone\Nwas trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:20,106 --> 01:55:22,227
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:22,777 --> 01:55:24,507
No.

891
01:55:25,977 --> 01:55:27,407
Shame.

892
01:55:29,077 --> 01:55:30,807
Drink up.

893
01:55:34,218 --> 01:55:36,378
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:36,588 --> 01:55:38,618
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:38,828 --> 01:55:40,449
Help us?

896
01:55:40,659 --> 01:55:42,889
Or help you?

897
01:56:23,273 --> 01:56:24,433
Hello.

898
01:56:24,643 --> 01:56:26,474
Hello.

899
01:56:28,184 --> 01:56:29,474
You all right?

900
01:56:30,114 --> 01:56:32,274
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:32,484 --> 01:56:37,115
Every time I do, you look at me as if\Nyou haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:38,255 --> 01:56:40,245
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:43,996 --> 01:56:47,096
If you'd just been born...

904
01:56:47,766 --> 01:56:50,036
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:56:50,806 --> 01:56:52,996
You have me there.

906
01:56:55,677 --> 01:56:58,377
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:00,447 --> 01:57:01,977
I can?

908
01:57:02,188 --> 01:57:06,048
Yeah. Here, there,\Nanywhere you like.

909
01:57:07,058 --> 01:57:09,958
Does this mean\Nthat you're warming to me?

910
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:12,359
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:12,559 --> 01:57:13,999
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:14,199 --> 01:57:18,069
...I would have described\Nyour feelings towards me as....

913
01:57:19,539 --> 01:57:22,170
I'm trying to think\Nof a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:25,640
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,670
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:31,451 --> 01:57:35,081
-Hello.\N-Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:36,521 --> 01:57:39,252
Monsieur Mendel.\NHow are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:39,462 --> 01:57:41,452
My apologies,\NI do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:41,662 --> 01:57:43,652
...but 120 million\Nis a large sum of money.

920
01:57:43,862 --> 01:57:46,692
It certainly is. You didn't bring\Nany chocolates with you?

921
01:57:46,902 --> 01:57:49,023
I'm afraid not.

922
01:57:50,233 --> 01:57:53,103
If you would type in\Nthe account number.

923
01:58:00,184 --> 01:58:01,584
And now the password.

924
01:58:02,384 --> 01:58:03,544
You can do that.

925
01:58:04,254 --> 01:58:06,315
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:06,925 --> 01:58:13,295
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:24,146 --> 01:58:25,937
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:26,147 --> 01:58:29,007
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:30,847 --> 01:58:34,078
-Auf Wiedersehen.\N-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:40,658 --> 01:58:42,058
You know, James...

931
01:58:44,669 --> 01:58:47,569
...I just want you to know\Nthat if all that was left of you...

932
01:58:47,769 --> 01:58:51,069
...was your smile\Nand your little finger...

933
01:58:51,269 --> 01:58:54,000
...you'd still be more of a man\Nthan anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:07,081
That's because you know\Nwhat I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:09,962 --> 01:59:13,832
-I have no idea.\N-But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:17,102 --> 01:59:21,033
You're not going to let me\Nin there, are you?

937
01:59:21,773 --> 01:59:23,903
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:24,103 --> 01:59:25,333
That's that.

939
01:59:26,843 --> 01:59:29,404
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:30,644 --> 01:59:33,144
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:34,014 --> 01:59:36,484
Whatever is left of me....

942
01:59:36,954 --> 01:59:39,825
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:40,655 --> 01:59:42,625
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:42,825 --> 01:59:45,315
...l'm yours.

945
02:00:46,762 --> 02:00:49,762
I suppose M won't miss me\Nfor a couple of days.

946
02:00:50,503 --> 02:00:52,333
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:00:52,543 --> 02:00:53,733
Mathis?

948
02:00:53,943 --> 02:00:55,963
Remember I told you\Nabout Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:00:56,173 --> 02:00:58,613
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:00:59,184 --> 02:01:00,734
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:00,954 --> 02:01:04,614
Same goes for the implant. Can't say\NI'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:07,014
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:07,224 --> 02:01:08,815
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:11,695
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:12,365 --> 02:01:14,155
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:15,565 --> 02:01:17,966
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:19,906 --> 02:01:21,636
Yes.

958
02:01:24,576 --> 02:01:26,336
Everyone.

959
02:01:26,747 --> 02:01:28,577
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:33,047 --> 02:01:35,077
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:39,058
You love me?

962
02:01:39,588 --> 02:01:41,858
Enough to quit\Nand float round the world with you...

963
02:01:42,058 --> 02:01:44,258
...until one of us\Nhas to find an honest job.

964
02:01:44,899 --> 02:01:48,959
But I think that's gonna have to be you.\NI've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:01:49,869 --> 02:01:51,299
You're serious.

966
02:01:52,269 --> 02:01:54,170
Like you said...

967
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,440
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:59,440
...and there won't be any soul\Nleft to salvage.

969
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:02,510
I'm leaving with\Nwhat little I have left.

970
02:02:04,521 --> 02:02:06,611
Is that enough for you?

971
02:03:50,972 --> 02:03:52,873
-Come on.\N-No. No.

972
02:03:53,373 --> 02:03:56,573
No, stop it. Stop.\NI have to get to the bank.

973
02:03:56,773 --> 02:03:58,973
What's the time?

974
02:04:01,213 --> 02:04:03,274
How much do we need\Nto float for a month?

975
02:04:03,754 --> 02:04:05,514
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:05,724 --> 02:04:09,654
No, I want to pay for my half\Nof our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:12,595 --> 02:04:14,925
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:15,135 --> 02:04:18,295
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:18,505 --> 02:04:21,236
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:26,006 --> 02:04:29,377
To realize sometimes\Nyou can forget the past.

981
02:04:38,088 --> 02:04:39,988
Though apparently not\Nyour employer.

982
02:04:44,428 --> 02:04:47,659
Back in one month.

983
02:04:48,739 --> 02:04:51,139
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:04:51,339 --> 02:04:53,499
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:23,172 --> 02:05:25,603
I'll see you back here\Nin half an hour.

986
02:05:50,105 --> 02:05:52,536
-Hello, M.\N-I got your note.

987
02:05:52,736 --> 02:05:54,396
{\i1}Yes?{\i0}

988
02:05:54,606 --> 02:05:56,436
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:05:56,646 --> 02:05:59,636
Right now I have a lovely man\Nfrom the Treasury here...

990
02:05:59,846 --> 02:06:02,407
...wondering if you're ever\Ngoing to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:06,117 --> 02:06:08,957
That's a shame.\NI didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:09,158 --> 02:06:12,458
{\i1}Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.{\i0}

993
02:06:12,658 --> 02:06:14,818
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:15,168 --> 02:06:17,788
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:18,199 --> 02:06:20,899
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:21,369 --> 02:06:22,529
{\i1}Hello.{\i0}

997
02:06:22,739 --> 02:06:26,139
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble\Naccessing the funds in my account.

998
02:06:26,339 --> 02:06:28,170
It was transferred\Nto the account number...

999
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,680
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1000
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:36,721
It appears the funds\Nare being withdrawn as we speak.

1001
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:41,251
-Where?\N-the Venice branch, of course.

1002
02:06:41,461 --> 02:06:42,691
St. Mark's Square.

1003
02:06:45,061 --> 02:06:46,762
{\i1}Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?{\i0}

1004
02:08:59,476 --> 02:09:00,636
I'll kill her!

1005
02:09:01,646 --> 02:09:02,847
Allow me.

1006
02:13:22,805 --> 02:13:24,775
I'm sorry, James.

1007
02:16:36,456 --> 02:16:39,187
{\i1}She had a boyfriend.\NA French Algerian.{\i0}

1008
02:16:39,387 --> 02:16:41,447
{\i1}They were very much in love.{\i0}

1009
02:16:41,857 --> 02:16:44,987
{\i1}He was kidnapped\Nby the organization behind Le Chiffre.{\i0}

1010
02:16:45,197 --> 02:16:50,158
And they blackmailed her, threatening\Nto kill him unless she cooperated.

1011
02:16:50,368 --> 02:16:51,738
We should've picked up on it...

1012
02:16:51,938 --> 02:16:54,168
...but sometimes\Nwe're so focused on our enemies...

1013
02:16:54,368 --> 02:16:55,898
...we forget to watch our friends.

1014
02:16:57,539 --> 02:16:59,409
{\i1}How are you doing?{\i0}

1015
02:16:59,749 --> 02:17:01,979
She left her cell phone.

1016
02:17:02,179 --> 02:17:04,549
She must have known I'd check it.

1017
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:07,510
She knew you were you.

1018
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:10,820
{\i1}-Well, at least this clears Mathis.\N-No.{\i0}

1019
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:12,650
-No?\N-No.

1020
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:15,351
We just proved that she's guilty,\Nnot that he's innocent.

1021
02:17:15,561 --> 02:17:17,891
It could've been a double blind.\NKeep sweating him.

1022
02:17:18,701 --> 02:17:20,461
You don't trust anyone,\Ndo you, James?

1023
02:17:20,671 --> 02:17:22,291
{\i1}No.{\i0}

1024
02:17:22,801 --> 02:17:25,072
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1025
02:17:25,872 --> 02:17:28,072
Get back as soon as you can.\NWe need you.

1026
02:17:28,812 --> 02:17:29,972
Will do.

1027
02:17:32,252 --> 02:17:33,613
If you do need time....

1028
02:17:33,813 --> 02:17:35,083
{\i1}Why should I need more time?{\i0}

1029
02:17:36,223 --> 02:17:39,483
The job's done,\Nand the bitch is dead.

1030
02:17:40,423 --> 02:17:42,224
James...

1031
02:17:42,864 --> 02:17:46,264
...did you ever ask yourself\Nwhy you weren't killed that night?

1032
02:17:46,864 --> 02:17:48,554
{\i1}Isn't it obvious?{\i0}

1033
02:17:48,764 --> 02:17:52,725
{\i1}She made a deal to spare your life\Nin exchange for the money.{\i0}

1034
02:17:52,935 --> 02:17:55,095
{\i1}I'm sure she hoped\Nthey would let her live.{\i0}

1035
02:17:56,675 --> 02:17:59,665
But she must have known\Nshe was going to her death.

1036
02:18:00,776 --> 02:18:03,716
{\i1}And now we'll never know\Nwho was behind this.{\i0}

1037
02:18:03,916 --> 02:18:06,476
{\i1}The trail's gone cold.{\i0}

1038
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:35,916
{\i1}-Hello.\N-Mr. White?{\i0}

1039
02:19:36,116 --> 02:19:37,606
{\i1}We need to talk.{\i0}

1040
02:19:37,816 --> 02:19:39,686
Who is this?

1041
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:11,980
The name's Bond.

1042
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:14,130
James Bond.
