english by sub-stance

00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:08,155
Submitted here is the story of a little boy,
and a magical christmas wish,

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:11,027
that changed his life...forever

4
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:19,116
it began in 1985, 
in a town just outside Boston

5
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:24,819
it was christmas eve, 
and all the children were in high spirits

6
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:29,832
that special time of year, 
when Boston children gather together

7
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:34,637
and beat up the jewish kids.
-hey greenbob,uh oh...get him

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,996
but there was one child who 
wasn't in such good spirits

9
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:45,010
little John Bennett

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:50,144
that one boy in every neighbourhood, 
who just has a tough time making friends

11
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,900
hey guys, can i play?

12
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:54,440
get out of here bennet,
-get lost bennet

13
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:56,819
get out of here bennet,
yeah bennet, get lost

14
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:05,764
John longed with all his heart,for that 
one true friend that he could call his own

15
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:12,401
and he knew that if he ever found 
that friend, he would ever let him go

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,457
well, as it does every year, 
christams morning finally came

17
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:22,745
all of the children were opening 
their gifts with holiday glee

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,340
and for little John bennet, christams day 
brought a very special new arrival.

19
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:46,711
Wow.i guess santa payed attention 
to how good you were this year huh...

20
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,903
aww, merry christams John

21
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,301
"I love you"

22
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,117
he talks.

23
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,045
im gonna name you teddy

24
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,820
John became instantly attached to teddy,
there was something about that bear

25
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:12,234
that made him feel as if he finally had a friend.
with whom he could share his deepest secrets

26
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,739
"i love you"

27
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:16,267
i love you too teddy

28
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:21,341
you know, i wish you could really talk to me

29
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:25,025
because then we could be best 
friends forever and ever

30
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,741
now if theres one thing 
you can be sure of,

31
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:34,310
its that nothing is more powerful 
than a young boys wish

32
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,175
except an apache helicopter...
an apache helicopter

33
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,743
has machine guns and missiles

34
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:46,402
it is an unbelievably impressive
complement of weaponry. 
An absolute death machine

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,295
well as it turned out, John had picked 
a perfect night to make a wish

36
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:32,090
teddy...

37
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,515
teddy?

38
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:43,204
teddy

39
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,690
hug me

40
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,780

41
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:58,898

42
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:02,235

who wished for it arent you?

43
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,188

44
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,043
i did wish for it

45
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,720
well, here i am...

46
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:12,055

be best friends for real?

47
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,513

48
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,978

49
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,576
sounds good to me

50
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,754
John was just about the happiest boy 
in the world. And he couldn't wait 
to tell everyone the good news

51
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,791

57
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:44,003

61
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,365
is it a hugging gun?

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,842
Helen, get my gun and call the police

63
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:55,496
im sorry mr bennet, i didnt 
mean to scare anybody

64
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,642
i just wanted john and i to be friends

65
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:02,314
yeah dad, i made a wish last night that 
teddy was alive, and my wish came true

66
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:05,619
oh god

67
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,729
its a miracle

68
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:12,070
its a christmas miracle

69
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,013
your just like the baby Jesus

70
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:22,295
well it wasnt long before the news of 
Johns little miracle was sweeping the nation

71
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,421
out of a Boston suburb comes, what is 
without doubt the most incredible story

72
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:31,041
a young boys stuffed animal, 
has magically come to life
for unknown reasons

73
00:05:31,076 --> 00:05:35,615
LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!
LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!

74
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,738
before long, teddy had become a 
huge celebrity in his own right

75
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,593
hello teddy

76
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:57,294
you surprise me, for some reason i 
thought you were going to be taller

77
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,565
i thought you were 
going to be funnier...

78
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:09,603
but for all the fame, teddy never 
forgot his very best friend, John

79
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,154
the thunder cant get us, right?

80
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:16,331
nope. were thunder buddys.
and the thunder knows it

81
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,279
were totally safe

82
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:21,443
teddy...
-yeah John?

83
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:24,228
do you promise that 
we'll always be together?

84
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:26,272
i promise.

85
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:31,151
thunder buddys for life

86
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:34,294
-thunder buddys for life.

87
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:40,610
and that was a promise that 
niether one of them forgot

88
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,908
so...where are John and teddy today?

89
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:47,174
well, let me put it this way

90
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,471
no matter how big a splash you make 
in this world, weather your a

91
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:54,488
Corey Feldman,Frankie Muniz,
Justin Bieber...

92
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:58,719
or a talking teddy bear...
eventually nobody gives a shit

93
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:04,382
-

94
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:27,577
TED

95
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:30,579
-

96
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,007
-

97
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:41,239
look, all im saying is that Boston women
are, on the whole, a paler uglier sort
than women from the elsewheres of life

98
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:43,771
thats bullshit...what about Lori?
shes hot...

99
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,860

100

there not that bad...

101
00:09:46,982 --> 00:09:51,020
see, the fact that you have to say there 
not that bad, means that they are that bad

102
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:56,860
you ever hear a Boston girl have an orgasm?

-it doesnt work

240
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:43,675
the name has to have a ski at the 
end of it, and you just put brewski 
at the end of martina navratilova

241
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,702
i just thought we 
were saying funny names

00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:49,144
no. it has to have ski at the end of it, 
else wheres the challange?

243
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:54,003

hes the only reason i ever 
gained any fucking confidence

378
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:47,073

your 35 years old

379

hes not your only friend anymore

a huge part of your life just 
to make your girlfriend happier

you to motivate them

00:37:21,912 --> 00:37:24,489
im trying to get my shit together and be 
an adult here you know, for Lori's sake


565
00:37:24,524 --> 00:37:26,616

ill kick you out, i promise

566
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:31,182
just come over.
i got the cheers dvd boxset

567
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:34,129
and the guy down at the store told 
me everybody talks shit about each 
other in the inteviews

568
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,527

569
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:37,872

570
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:42,401

571
00:37:42,436 --> 00:37:44,049

572
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,529
just tell him you dont feel well

573
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,774
i got to cut out for a bit, 
Lori tried to break up a dog fight
and guess she got hurt pretty bad

574
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:51,931
oh my god

575
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:55,464
yeah thats the way she is. she sees 
trouble and she tries to help out

576
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:59,698
and i guess one of these dogs clamped 
its jaws on her forearm, and wouldnt 
let go untill a fireman showed up

577
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,376
and had to stick a finger in its ass

578
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:05,167
oh jesus
-yeah shes pretty shook up

579
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,316
up the dogs ass right...

580
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,288
yeah the dogs not the firemans ass

581
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,155
i thought the fireman stuck 
his finger up his own ass

582
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,397
i dont think a firefighter 
would do that, i mean...

583
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:15,587
well go go, take care of it, let me 
know how she is. thank you. -Go

685
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:49,418

692
00:44:12,656 --> 00:44:19,485

im an asshole, i know that.
it worked for me in highschool.
 and its been a reflex ever since


940
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:29,079
Lori, the worst that can happen is you 
go on a fun casual date, with a guy

941
01:02:29,114 --> 01:02:33,186
who just wants to prove that he 
can be something more than a jerk

942
01:02:33,221 --> 01:02:38,302
plus you are a huge catch, and its 
about time someone treated you that way

943
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:43,056
fuck it, fine

944
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:45,528
sure beats crying myself to 
sleep every night

945
01:02:45,563 --> 01:02:48,352
and if that means getting you 
off my back,well thats just a bonus

01:03:19,497 --> 01:03:21,246
but just listen to me for 5 seconds

953
01:03:21,281 --> 01:03:23,781
i saw Lori leaving the 
apartment with Rex

954
01:03:23,816 --> 01:03:24,741

maybe take some of the heat off you

956
01:03:27,828 --> 01:03:29,451
and there he was, picking her up

957
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:30,878
they were going to the hatshell

958
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:33,383

you know that

959
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:34,762
i mean how stupid do 
you think i am?

960
01:03:34,763 --> 01:03:39,157
if you think that by making shit up like 
that your going to make me choose some 
kind of loyalty to you over her

961
01:03:39,158 --> 01:03:41,255
your out your fucking mind.
John its the truth im telling you

962
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:43,251

cant be that either right.cos how can you 
have any pudding, if you dont eat your meat

968
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:07,887
pink floyd thing...the point is,
your blaming me, for something 
that you did to yourself

969
01:04:07,922 --> 01:04:13,399
Lori was right about you. you cannot 
take any responsibility for anything 
that goes on in your life

970
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:14,780
oh and you can?

971
01:04:14,815 --> 01:04:17,039

im a fucking teddybear

972
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:20,721
you know something... i didnt tie 
you up and drag you to that party

973
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,904
alright, i wanted you to come because 
your supposedly my best friend

974
01:04:23,939 --> 01:04:26,955
you cant stand there and tell 
me you havent always seen Lori 
as a threat to our friendship

975
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:31,082
i mean it works out so much better 
for you when were getting fucked 
up on the couch at 9A.M doesnt it?

976
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:35,017
listen to yourself, what am i, emperor 
ming here controlling your mind

977
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:40,449
thats your choice John. and you know 
by blaming me, you just make 
yourself look like a pussy

978
01:04:41,421 --> 01:04:46,191

christmas morning, when i was 8 years old

and then when we seen it fall from the 
tree we both started crying, you remember?

996
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:14,288
and we ran upto it, and 
we tried to give it CPR

997
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:16,297
and it came back to life

998
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,256
John, we could do that again

999
01:07:19,257 --> 01:07:23,138
ted, we blew out its rib cage and crushed 
its lungs trying to give it CPR

1000
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,523

of the most important night of my life.
the night we met

1031
01:10:02,825 --> 01:10:06,526
umm, this is the theme song 
from the movie octopussy

1032
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:25,389

1033
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:50,908

1034
01:10:50,943 --> 01:10:52,367

1035
01:10:58,564 --> 01:10:59,668

1036
01:11:05,934 --> 01:11:06,812

that was insane

1039
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:23,753
did you see the way the guys body hit 
the ground?. it was like a rag doll

1040
01:11:25,177 --> 01:11:27,148
id rather just not talk about it

1041
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:28,882
you want to go get a drink after this?

1042
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:31,093
i feel like i could use one
after seeing a guy almost die

1043
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,844
uh nope, i think id rather 
just have you take me home

1044
01:11:33,879 --> 01:11:36,548

1045
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,569

1046
01:11:38,604 --> 01:11:40,483
alright, i get it

1047
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:43,121
and you know, i dont blame you

1048
01:11:43,156 --> 01:11:48,383
i mean thing about it, it was actually 
unfair of him to embarrass you like that

1049
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:52,275
just to be clear, 
im not embarrassed

1050
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:56,263
so John and i have our problems,
but at least he tried

1051
01:11:57,448 --> 01:12:00,555
you know what, i dont feel 
like talking to you about this

1052
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,482
where you going?

1053
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:05,004
taking a cab, im going home

1054
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:11,116
finally

1055
01:12:21,736 --> 01:12:25,470
down here, not looking up your 
towell, swear to god

1056
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:27,698
not looking up your towell, 
not looking at your funny business

1057
01:12:27,733 --> 01:12:29,543
ted, what are you doing here?

1058
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,731
i need to talk to you

1059
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:34,385
listen if your here to fight 
Johns battles for him its not...

1060
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:37,735
just let me talk first alright, 
and then you can say whatever you want

1061
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:45,660
look, John loves you very much

1062
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,180
more than anything in the world

1063
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:50,789
and hes falling to fucking 
pieces without you

1064
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,762
he knows he screwed up huge. but you 
gotta believe me,

1065
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:59,832
it wasnt all his fault alright. i told 
him to bail on you that night at Rex's

1066
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:02,903
and he said no, he was going 
to stay there with you

1067
01:13:02,938 --> 01:13:04,602
and i twisted his arm Lori

1068
01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:07,864
so if you just give 
him one more chance

1069
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:10,820
i promise i will leave, 
and ill never come back

1070
01:13:10,855 --> 01:13:12,898
alright...hell be all yours

1071
01:13:13,964 --> 01:13:18,530
ted, thats a really nice offer. 
but i dont want you to do that

1072
01:13:18,565 --> 01:13:23,117
this is between John and me, 
and i dont think it can be fixed

1073
01:13:23,152 --> 01:13:24,536
yeah because of me

1074
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:27,665
look look Lori, 
you want him to be a man

1075
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,245
but as long as hes got his teddybear, 
hes always going to be a boy

1076
01:13:34,311 --> 01:13:39,941
hes waiting down at Charlies right now, 
so if you go down there and just talk to him

1077
01:13:39,976 --> 01:13:42,611
ill be gone when you get back

1078
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:45,095
forever

1079
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:50,622
and youll see. hell never be 
scared of thunder again

1080
01:14:35,428 --> 01:14:38,044

if its ok with you, i just want 
to say what i want to say

1094
01:15:45,677 --> 01:15:49,784

im sorry, and it was a huge 
misunderstanding, im ready to change

1095
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:53,553
but i dont think you want to 
hear any of that crap

1096
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:58,483
im not going to try and get you 
to take me back. i mean, why would you

1097
01:15:58,518 --> 01:16:01,452

the last 4 years, i dont deserve you

1098
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:06,696
look, i know i didnt take our 
relationship seriously, but Lori

1099
01:16:06,731 --> 01:16:09,010

you were the most amazing most 
wonderful thing id ever seen,ever.

1125
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:27,860
and i asked my dad if i could have 
a magical teddybear too

1126
01:18:27,895 --> 01:18:29,253
