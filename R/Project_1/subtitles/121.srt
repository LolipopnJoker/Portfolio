1
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,567
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

2
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,124
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.

3
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,561
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

4
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,161
- There you are.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,850
Master Stadle.

6
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,370
Mind if I join you?

7
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,330
I'll have the same.

8
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,691
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

9
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,406
Gandalf the Grey.

10
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,644
I know who you are.

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,163
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,046
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

13
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,570
I received word that my father...

14
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,520
...had been seen wandering...

15
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,568
...the Wilds near Dunland.

16
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,485
I went looking.

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,731
I found no sign of him.

18
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,329
Thrain.

19
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,202
You're like the others.

20
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,811
You think he is dead.

21
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,567
I was not at the Battle of Moria.

22
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,404
No...

23
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,408
...but I was.

24
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,325
<i>My grandfather...</i>

25
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
<i>...Thror...</i>

26
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
<i>...was slain.</i>

27
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
No!

28
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,969
Father.

29
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,803
Stay back.

30
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,530
No. I will fight with you.

31
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,167
Azog means to kill us all.

32
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,646
One by one, he will destroy
the line of Durin.

33
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,441
But by mine's life, he
shall not take my son.

34
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,960
You will stay here.

35
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,965
<i>My father led a charge
towards the Dimrill Gate.</i>

36
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>He never returned.</i>

37
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Father!

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,968
<i>"Thrain is gone, " they told me.</i>

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,646
<i>"He is one of the fallen."</i>

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,001
<i>But at the end of that battle,
I searched amongst the slain.</i>

41
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,402
<i>To the last body.</i>

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,887
My father was not among the dead.

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,929
Thorin, it's been a long time...

44
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,049
...since anything but rumor was heard...

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
...of Thrain.

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,003
He still lives.

47
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,765
I am sure of it.

48
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,441
The ring your grandfather wore,
one of the seven...

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,250
...given the Dwarf-lords...

50
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,130
...many years ago...

51
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,403
...what became of it?

52
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,962
He gave it to my father
before they went into battle.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,044
So Thrain was wearing it when he...

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,681
When he went missing.

55
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,007
Mm.

56
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,084
- That's that, then.
- There you are.

57
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,050
My father came to see you...

58
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,960
...before the Battle of Moria.

59
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,651
What did you say to him?

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,282
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,403
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...

62
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,563
...to destroy the dragon and take back...

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,450
...the Lonely Mountain.

64
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,603
And I would say the same to you.

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,846
Take back your homeland.

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,849
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

67
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,041
No.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,331
It is not.

69
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,290
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

70
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,206
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,487
Sooner or later...

72
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,764
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,766
I ran into some unsavory characters...

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,287
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,291
They mistook me for a vagabond.

76
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,766
I imagine they regretted that.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,446
One of them was carrying a message.

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,250
It is Black Speech.

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,170
A promise of payment.

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,601
For what?

81
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,487
Your head.

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,643
Someone wants you dead.

83
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,123
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

84
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,044
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.

85
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,729
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

86
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,088
Together, you have the might and power...

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,243
...to retake Erebor.

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,762
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,729
Demand they stand by their oath.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,891
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

91
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,167
The Arkenstone.

92
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,160
It is the only thing that will...

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,805
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...

94
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,327
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

95
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,245
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,047
How?

97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,322
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,086
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.

99
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,481
Yes, it does.

100
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,406
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

101
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
How close is the pack?

102
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,121
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

103
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,960
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.

104
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,441
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?

105
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,283
They saw you.

106
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
No, that's not it.

107
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,522
What did I tell you?

108
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,091
Quiet as a mouse.

109
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,366
Excellent burglar material.

110
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
Will you listen? Will you just...

111
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,241
...listen?

112
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

113
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,161
What form did it take?

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,881
Like a bear?

115
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,810
Ye... Yes, but bigger.

116
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,121
Much bigger.

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,206
You knew about this beast?

118
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,246
I say we double back.

119
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,602
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

120
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,570
There is a house...

121
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,291
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

122
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,760
Whose house?

123
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,246
Are they friend or foe?

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,771
Neither.

125
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,728
He will help us or...

126
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,885
...he will kill us.

127
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,364
What choice do we have?

128
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,081
None.

129
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,850
Come on!

130
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,929
This way! Quickly!

131
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Run!

132
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,765
Bombur, come on!

133
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,050
To the house!

134
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,641
Run!

135
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,485
Come on, get inside.

136
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,201
Open the door!

137
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,606
Quickly!

138
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,643
- Push!
- Push!

139
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,163
Dwalin!

140
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Come on, lads!

141
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,883
What is...

142
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
...that?

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,444
That is our host.

144
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,202
His name is Beorn.

145
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,607
And he's a skin-changer.

146
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,248
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

147
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,001
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

148
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,362
The bear is unpredictable...

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,807
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

150
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,289
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.

151
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
He's leaving.

152
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,648
Come away from there.

153
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,366
It's not natural. None of it.

154
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,568
It's obvious. He's under some...

155
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
...dark spell.

156
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,001
Don't be a fool.

157
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,641
He's under no enchantment but his own.

158
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,090
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

159
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,687
You'll be safe here tonight.

160
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,529
I hope.

161
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,001
Don't blame me!

162
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,691
Come on, Dori!

163
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,606
Well, I say we should leg it.
Slip out the back way.

164
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,850
I'm not running from anyone, beast or no.

165
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,411
There is no point in arguing.

166
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,722
We cannot pass...

167
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
...through the Wilderland
without Beorn's help.

168
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,889
We'll be hunted down
before we ever get to the forest.

169
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,326
Ah, Bilbo.

170
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
There you are.

171
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,243
Now...

172
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,490
...this will require
some delicate handling.

173
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,768
We must tread very carefully.

174
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,005
The last person to have startled him
was torn to shreds.

175
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I will go first and...

176
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,640
Uh, Bilbo?

177
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,609
You come with me.

178
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,486
- Is this a good idea?
- Yes.

179
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,007
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here...

180
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,811
...and don't come out until I
give the signal. BOFUR: Right.

181
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,280
Wait for the signal.

182
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,842
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

183
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,401
And only come out in pairs. Right.

184
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,205
No, actually, Bombur...

185
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,842
...um, you count as two
so you should come out alone.

186
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,127
Mm.

187
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,926
Remember, wait for the signal.

188
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,845
The signal. Right.

189
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,120
What signal would that be?

190
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,400
- Ahem.
- You're nervous.

191
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,889
Nervous? What nonsense.

192
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Good morning.

193
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,689
Good morning!

194
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,965
Who are you?

195
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

196
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,729
Never heard of him.

197
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,041
I'm a Wizard.

198
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,165
Perhaps you've heard of my colleague
Radagast the Brown.

199
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,404
He resides in the southern borders
of Mirkwood.

200
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,768
What do you want?

201
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,561
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

202
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,560
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

203
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,484
...in your lodgings here last night.

204
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,763
Who is this...

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
...little fellow?

206
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,607
Well, this would be Mr. Baggins...

207
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,887
...from the Shire.

208
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,281
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

209
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,650
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

210
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,801
A good family
and unimpeachable reputation.

211
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,442
A Halfling and a Wizard.

212
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,600
How come you here?

213
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,523
Oh, well, the fact is...

214
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,001
...that we've had a bad time of it...

215
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,084
...from Goblins in the mountains.

216
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,685
What did you go near Goblins for?

217
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,450
Stupid thing to do.

218
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,926
You are absolutely...

219
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,241
...right. No, it...
- There it is. Go.

220
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,767
- Go.
- ...was terrible.

221
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,522
Dwalin...

222
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
...and Balin.

223
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,166
And I must...

224
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,408
...confess that, uh, several...

225
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,928
...of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

226
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,567
Do you call two...

227
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,041
... "several"?

228
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,851
Well, uh, now you put it that way...

229
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,400
Yes, there could be more...

230
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,647
...than two.

231
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Go, go.

232
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Wait, that's us.

233
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,287
Oh, and here are some more...

234
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,284
...of our, uh, happy troop.

235
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,727
And do you call six a "troop"?

236
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,201
What are you, a traveling circus?

237
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,048
Go.

238
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,361
Go. Go, go.

239
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,087
Dori and Ori at your service.

240
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,929
I don't...

241
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
...want your service.

242
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,480
Absolutely understandable.

243
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,403
Go.

244
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Go.

245
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,084
Oh, Fili and Kili. I'd
quite forgotten. Yes.

246
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,561
Oh, yes, and Nori, Bofur...

247
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,529
...Bifur...

248
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,650
...and Bombur.

249
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,404
Is that it?

250
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,725
Are there any more?

251
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,087
Ah.

252
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,766
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

253
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,771
Tell me...

254
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
...why is Azog...

255
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,568
...the Defiler hunting you?

256
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,605
You know of Azog?

257
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
How?

258
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,644
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...

259
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,606
...before the Orcs came down
from the North.

260
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,963
The Defiler killed most of my family.

261
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
But some he...

262
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,801
...enslaved.

263
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,965
Not for work, you understand...

264
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,645
...but for sport.

265
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,047
Caging skin-changers...

266
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,080
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

267
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,125
There are others like you?

268
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,205
Once there were many.

269
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
And now?

270
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,529
Now there is only one.

271
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,286
You need to reach...

272
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,206
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

273
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,566
Before Durin's Day falls.

274
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Yes.

275
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,890
You are running out of time.

276
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,327
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

277
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,370
A darkness lies upon that forest.

278
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,649
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

279
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,083
I would not venture there...

280
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,163
...except in great need.

281
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,402
We will take the Elven Road.

282
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
That path is still safe.

283
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,961
"Safe"?

284
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,811
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

285
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,080
...are not like their kin.

286
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,085
They're less wise...

287
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,249
...and more dangerous.

288
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,284
But it matters not.

289
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,281
What do you mean?

290
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,285
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

291
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,725
Their numbers are growing.

292
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,445
And you are on foot.

293
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
You will never reach...

294
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,608
...the forest alive.

295
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,401
I don't like Dwarves.

296
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,084
They're greedy...

297
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,801
...and blind.

298
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,169
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

299
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,886
...lesser than their own.

300
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,761
But Orcs I hate more.

301
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,250
What do you need?

302
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,049
You will leave my...

303
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,884
...ponies before you enter the forest.

304
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,849
Oh, you have my word.

305
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,206
We're being watched.

306
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,566
Yes.

307
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,047
The Orcs will not give up.

308
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,250
They will hunt the Dwarves
until they see them destroyed.

309
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,251
Why now? What has made
the Defiler crawl from his hole?

310
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,205
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...

311
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,482
...and the sorcerer in Dol Guldur.

312
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Are you sure of this?

313
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,927
Packs have been seen...

314
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,844
...gathering there.

315
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,481
Each day, more and more come.

316
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,288
What do you know of this sorcerer?

317
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,807
The one they call the Necromancer.

318
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,966
I know he is not what he seems.

319
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,124
Fell things are drawn to his power.

320
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,566
Azog pays...

321
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,285
...homage to him.

322
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,806
Gandalf.

323
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,607
Time is wasting.

324
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,848
There is more.

325
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,287
Not long past, word spread...

326
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,565
...the dead had been seen
walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur.

327
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
The dead?

328
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,450
Is it true?

329
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,490
Are there tombs in those mountains?

330
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,088
<i>When</i> Angmar fell...

331
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,682
<i>...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...</i>

332
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,880
<i>...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.</i>

333
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,730
<i>Deep within the rock, they buried him.</i>

334
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
<i>In a tomb so dark...</i>

335
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,929
<i>...it would never...</i>

336
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,207
<i>...come to light.</i>

337
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Yes.

338
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,167
Yes, there are tombs up there.

339
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,840
I remember a time when a great evil...

340
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,287
...ruled these lands.

341
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
One powerful...

342
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,048
...enough to raise the dead.

343
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,969
If that enemy has returned
to Middle-earth...

344
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,607
...I would have you tell me.

345
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,481
Saruman the White says it's not possible.

346
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,566
The enemy was destroyed
and will never return.

347
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,568
And what does...

348
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,325
...Gandalf the Grey say?

349
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,010
Go now.

350
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,888
While you have the light.

351
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,529
Your hunters are not far behind.

352
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,041
The Elven Gate.

353
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,525
Here lies our path...

354
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,290
...through Mirkwood.

355
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,689
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

356
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,048
Set the ponies loose.

357
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,126
Let them return to their master.

358
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
This forest...

359
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,651
...feels...

360
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,361
...sick.

361
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,047
As if a disease lies upon it.

362
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,164
Is there no way around?

363
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,880
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

364
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,202
Or twice that distance...

365
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,446
...south.

366
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,723
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

367
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,560
<i>...hidden from our sight.</i>

368
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,604
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

369
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,206
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

370
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,842
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

371
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,847
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

372
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,964
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

373
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,882
The High Fells.

374
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,325
So be it.

375
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,248
Not my horse!

376
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
I need it!

377
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,686
You're not leaving us?

378
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,684
I would not do this unless I had to.

379
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,606
You've changed...

380
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,609
...Bilbo Baggins.

381
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,049
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

382
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,530
I was going to tell you.

383
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,246
I...

384
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,202
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

385
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,811
Found what?

386
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,403
What did you find?

387
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,120
My courage.

388
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,968
Good. Well, that's good.

389
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,609
You'll need it.

390
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,491
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

391
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,886
...the slopes of Erebor.

392
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,487
Keep the map and key safe.

393
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,730
Do not enter that mountain without me.

394
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,883
This is not the Greenwood of old.

395
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,448
There is a stream in the woods
that carries a dark enchantment.

396
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,603
Do not touch the water.

397
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,241
Cross only by the stone bridge.

398
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,086
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

399
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,051
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

400
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,209
"Lead us astray"?

401
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,005
What does that mean?

402
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,489
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

403
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,962
If you do, you'll never...

404
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,486
...find it again.

405
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,730
No matter what may come, stay on...

406
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,643
...the path!

407
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,043
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

408
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,281
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.

409
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,040
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

410
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,450
The path turns this way.

411
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,686
This way.

412
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,443
Air. I need air.

413
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,728
My head, it's swimming!

414
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,930
- We found the bridge.
- Bridge.

415
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,801
Oh.

416
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,283
We could try and swim it.

417
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,807
Didn't you hear what Gandalf said?

418
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,089
A dark magic lies upon this forest.

419
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,769
The waters of this stream are enchanted.

420
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,851
Doesn't look very enchanting to me.

421
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,845
We must find another way across.

422
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,289
These vines look strong enough.

423
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,204
Kili!

424
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,329
We send the lightest first.

425
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,604
It's all right.

426
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,210
Can't see any problem.

427
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,726
There's one.

428
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,563
Everything's...

429
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,404
...fine.

430
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,691
Something is not right.

431
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,490
This is not right at all.

432
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,007
Stay where you are! Oh.

433
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,610
I can't get a grip.

434
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,804
What are you doing?

435
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,807
You shouldn't have done that.

436
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
It's bad luck.

437
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,365
I don't believe in luck.

438
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,690
We make our own luck.

439
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,681
We need...

440
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,843
...to take a rest.

441
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,720
What is that?

442
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,089
Those voices.

443
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,926
Can you hear them?

444
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,850
I hear nothing.

445
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,006
No wind...

446
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,441
...no birds.

447
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,884
What hour is it?

448
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,805
I do not know.

449
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
I do not even...

450
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,600
...know what day it is.

451
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,403
This is taking too long.

452
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,406
Is there no end to this...

453
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,081
...accursed forest?

454
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,606
None that I can see.

455
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,486
Only trees and more trees.

456
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,570
This way.

457
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,763
- Gandalf said...
- Do as I say. Follow me.

458
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,327
Attercop.

459
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,723
No, no, wait.

460
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,163
Wait.

461
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,564
Stop.

462
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,804
We can't leave the pa...

463
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,442
We must stay on the path.

464
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,447
I don't remember this bit.

465
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,324
None of it's familiar.

466
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,329
It's got to be here.

467
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,930
It can't have just disappeared.

468
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,561
Unless someone's moved it.

469
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,167
It's not over here neither.

470
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Look.

471
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,930
A tobacco pouch.

472
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,606
There's Dwarves in these woods.

473
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,491
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.

474
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,370
This is exactly the same as mine.

475
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,291
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

476
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,369
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

477
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,648
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

478
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,531
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

479
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,240
I thought you were the expert.

480
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,281
The sun.

481
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,764
We have to find...

482
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,280
...the sun.

483
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,281
Up there.

484
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
We need to...

485
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,125
...get above the canopy.

486
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,043
What was that?

487
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,130
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

488
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,844
We're being watched.

489
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,004
I can see a lake!

490
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,002
And a river.

491
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,370
And the Lonely Mountain.

492
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,609
We're almost there!

493
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,851
Can you hear me?

494
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,282
I know which way to go!

495
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,726
Hello?

496
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,286
Hello.

497
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Oh, no.

498
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Oh, come on.

499
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,251
Kill them! Kill them.

500
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,528
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

501
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,282
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

502
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,169
Stick it again.

503
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,448
Stick it again. Finish it off.

504
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,329
The meat's alive and kicking!

505
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,169
Kill him.

506
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,162
Kill him now.

507
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,004
Let us feast.

508
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,480
Feast! Feast!

509
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,802
Feast! Feast!

510
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,605
Eat them alive!

511
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,888
Feast!

512
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,123
- What is it?
- What is it?

513
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,207
Eat them alive!

514
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,568
Fat and juicy.

515
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,051
Just a...

516
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,361
...little taste.

517
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,407
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

518
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,886
Here.

519
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,763
Ah! It stings!

520
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It stings!

521
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,171
Sting.

522
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,406
That's a good name.

523
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,326
Sting.

524
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,444
You all right there, Bofur?

525
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,080
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!

526
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,366
Where's Bilbo?

527
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I'm up here!

528
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Grab the legs!

529
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Pull!

530
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,721
Pull!

531
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,087
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

532
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,961
Where is it?

533
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
No!

534
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,806
No! No!

535
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,008
Thorin! Get them!

536
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
Come on!

537
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,444
Look out, brother!

538
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Fili!

539
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,971
Mine.

540
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:37,963
Come on...

541
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,361
...keep up!

542
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,246
We're clear!

543
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,561
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

544
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,484
It would be my pleasure.

545
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,770
- Help!
- Kili!

546
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,961
Throw me a dagger!

547
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,881
Quick!

548
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,203
If you think I'm giving you...

549
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,521
...a weapon, Dwarf...

550
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,841
...you're mistaken!

551
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,365
Search them.

552
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,968
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

553
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,401
Who is this?

554
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,165
- Your brother?
- That is...

555
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,686
...my wife!

556
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,042
And what is this horrid creature?

557
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,446
A Goblin-mutant?

558
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,603
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

559
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,920
Where did you get this?

560
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,486
It was given to me.

561
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,328
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

562
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,605
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

563
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,322
Unh! This is not the end of it!

564
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,845
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

565
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,645
Get off me!

566
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,045
Aren't you going to search me?

567
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,887
I could have anything down my trousers.

568
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,284
Or nothing.

569
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,040
- Again!
- Leave it!

570
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,131
There's no way out!

571
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,362
This is no Orc dungeon.

572
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,120
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

573
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,200
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

574
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,441
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

575
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,924
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

576
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,929
...and slay a dragon.

577
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,325
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

578
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,850
Attempted burglary.

579
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,887
Or something of that ilk.

580
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,802
You have found...

581
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,041
...a way in.

582
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,400
You seek that which would...

583
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,484
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

584
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,049
The King's Jewel.

585
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,450
The Arkenstone.

586
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,042
It is precious to you beyond measure.

587
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,769
I understand that.

588
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,361
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

589
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,681
White gems...

590
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,968
...of pure starlight.

591
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,287
I offer you my help.

592
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,845
I am listening.

593
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,724
I will let you go...

594
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,405
...if you but return what is mine.

595
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,931
A favor for a favor.

596
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,240
You have my word.

597
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,046
One king to another.

598
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,443
I would not trust Thranduil...

599
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,480
...the great king...

600
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,841
...to honor his word...

601
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,606
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

602
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
You...

603
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
...who lack all...

604
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,521
...honor!

605
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,648
I have seen how you treat your friends.

606
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,961
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

607
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,645
...seeking your help.

608
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,567
But you turned your back!

609
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,487
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

610
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,728
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

611
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,402
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

612
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,449
I know...

613
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,961
...its wrath and ruin.

614
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,326
I have faced...

615
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,365
...the great serpents of the North.

616
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,169
I warned your...

617
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,728
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

618
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,203
But he would not listen.

619
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,808
You are just like him.

620
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,044
Stay here if you will...

621
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,850
...and rot.

622
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,003
A hundred years is a mere blink...

623
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,242
...in the life of an Elf.

624
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,164
I'm patient.

625
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,202
I can wait.

626
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,761
Did he offer you a deal?

627
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,161
He did.

628
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,247
I told him he could go
ish <i>kakhfé</i> ai-'d dur-rugnu!

629
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Him and all his kin!

630
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,604
Well, that's that, then.

631
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,800
A deal was our only hope.

632
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,009
Not our only hope.

633
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,291
I know you're there.

634
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,084
Why do you linger in the shadows?

635
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,481
I was coming to report to you.

636
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,008
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

637
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,923
We cleared...

638
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,640
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

639
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,000
...coming up from the South.

640
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:45,843
They are spawning in...

641
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,367
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

642
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,808
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

643
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,845
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

644
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,726
And when we drive them off, what then?

645
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,570
Will they not spread to other lands?

646
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,684
Other lands are not my concern.

647
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,766
The fortunes of the world...

648
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,081
...will rise and fall.

649
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,320
But here in this...

650
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,560
...kingdom, we will endure.

651
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,520
Legolas said you fought well today.

652
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,569
He has grown very fond of you.

653
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,244
I assure you, my lord...

654
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,450
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

655
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,523
Perhaps he did once.

656
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,086
Now I am not so sure.

657
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,961
I do not think you would allow your son...

658
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,646
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

659
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,491
No, you are right. I would not.

660
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,527
Still, he cares about you.

661
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,886
Do not give him hope where there is none.

662
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,323
The stone in your hand, what is it?

663
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,285
It is a talisman.

664
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,125
A powerful spell lies upon it.

665
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,085
If any but a Dwarf
reads the runes on this stone...

666
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,160
...they will be forever cursed.

667
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,520
Or not.

668
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,120
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

669
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,326
A rune stone.

670
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,083
My mother...

671
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,243
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.

672
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,366
What promise?

673
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,245
That I would come back to her.

674
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,400
She worries.

675
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,410
She thinks I'm reckless.

676
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,246
Are you?

677
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,080
Nah.

678
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,770
Sounds like quite a party...

679
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,405
...you're having up there.

680
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,088
<i>It is Mereth e-nGilith...</i>

681
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,525
...the Feast of Starlight.

682
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,161
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

683
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,208
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

684
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,370
I always thought it is a cold light.

685
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,761
Remote and far away.

686
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,844
It is memory...

687
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,769
...precious and pure.

688
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,771
Like your promise.

689
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,089
I have walked there sometimes.

690
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Beyond the forest...

691
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,765
...and up into the night.

692
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,364
I have seen the world fall away...

693
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,410
...and the white light
of forever fill the air.

694
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,689
I saw a fire moon once.

695
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,251
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

696
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,086
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

697
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,890
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

698
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,283
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

699
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,808
...keeping the mountain to our left.

700
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,770
And then it appeared.

701
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,049
This huge fire moon...

702
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,130
...lighting our path.

703
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,647
I wish I could show you the caverns.

704
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,565
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

705
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,209
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

706
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,488
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

707
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,960
Say what you like about our...

708
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,402
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

709
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,925
<i>Come, Elros, try it.</i>

710
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,640
I have the Dwarves...

711
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,721
...in my charge.

712
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,044
They're locked up.
Where can they go? Ha, ha.

713
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,691
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

714
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,649
Must be nearly dawn.

715
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,201
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

716
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,242
Not stuck in here, you're not.

717
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,849
Bilbo!

718
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,080
What?

719
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,451
Shh! There are guards nearby!

720
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,122
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

721
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,567
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

722
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,960
- Up the stairs.
- You first.

723
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,683
Ori.

724
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,560
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

725
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Go.

726
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,365
Easy, now.

727
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,521
This way.

728
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,407
Come on.

729
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,320
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

730
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,249
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

731
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,203
I know what I'm doing!

732
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
Shh!

733
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,444
This way! This way!

734
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,043
Everyone...

735
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,561
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

736
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,443
- They'll find us.
- No, no.

737
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,727
They won't, I promise you.

738
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,487
Please, please. You must trust me.

739
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,441
Do as he says.

740
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,880
Move your big ginger head.

741
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,569
Bifur, get in...

742
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,763
...the barrel! Move!

743
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,130
Everyone’s in.

744
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,169
What do we do now?

745
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,921
Hold your breath.

746
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,720
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

747
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,365
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

748
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,726
Well done, Master Baggins.

749
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,441
Go! Come on, let's go!

750
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,090
Hold on!

751
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,651
Bilbo!

752
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,480
Hang on!

753
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,407
- Help!
- Ori!

754
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,120
No!

755
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,244
Watch out! There's Orcs!

756
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,240
Get under the bridge!

757
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,880
Kili!

758
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Kili!

759
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,560
Kili.

760
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,240
Kili!

761
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,286
Nori!

762
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,161
Cut the log!

763
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,240
Bombur!

764
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,720
Tauriel.

765
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,601
Oh, it's you!

766
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,451
Why am I here, Gandalf?

767
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,886
Trust me, Radagast.

768
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,090
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

769
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,211
This is not a nice place to meet.

770
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,566
No.

771
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,010
It is not.

772
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,606
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

773
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,565
Old and full of hate.

774
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,171
Who's buried here?

775
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,888
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

776
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,202
He would have been known only...

777
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,761
...as a servant of evil.

778
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,288
One of a number.

779
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,363
One of nine.

780
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,522
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

781
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,363
The Ringwraiths...

782
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,409
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

783
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,608
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

784
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,367
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.

785
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,568
Who said it was human?

786
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,881
The Nine only answer to one master.

787
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,726
We've been blind, Radagast.

788
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,042
And in our blindness...

789
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,408
...the Enemy has returned.

790
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,042
He is summoning his servants.

791
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,444
Azog the Defiler...

792
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,683
...is no ordinary hunter.

793
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,251
He is a commander.

794
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,042
A commander of legions.

795
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,491
The Enemy is preparing for war.

796
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,850
It will begin in the East.

797
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,891
His mind is set upon that mountain.

798
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,003
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

799
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,240
Gandalf.

800
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,125
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

801
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,283
They are in grave danger.

802
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,806
If what you say is true...

803
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,771
...the world is in grave danger.

804
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,441
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

805
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,889
You want me to cast my friends aside?

806
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,201
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.

807
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,680
I think we've outrun the Orcs.
Not for long. We've lost the current.

808
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,649
Bombur's half drowned.

809
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,969
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

810
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,240
Come on, let's go!

811
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,209
Gloin, help me, my brother.

812
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,409
Come on, lift yourself.

813
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,001
Come on!

814
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,686
Come on, you big lump, you!

815
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,529
I'm fine. It's nothing.

816
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,760
On your feet.

817
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,968
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

818
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,601
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

819
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
To where?

820
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,923
To the mountain. We're so close.

821
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,410
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

822
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,927
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

823
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,170
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

824
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,482
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

825
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,404
Bind his leg, quickly.

826
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,490
You have two minutes.

827
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Do it again...

828
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,601
...and you're dead.

829
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,526
Excuse me...

830
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,889
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

831
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,366
That barge over there...

832
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,888
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

833
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,642
What makes you think I would help you?

834
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,729
Those boots have seen better days.

835
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,890
As has that coat.

836
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,928
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

837
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,451
How many bairns?

838
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,010
A boy and two girls.

839
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,571
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

840
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,921
Aye.

841
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,441
She was.

842
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,170
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

843
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,283
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

844
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,086
What's your hurry?

845
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,566
What's it to you?

846
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,484
I would like to know who you are...

847
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,360
...and what you are doing in these lands.

848
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,006
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

849
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,805
...journeying to see our kin...

850
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,650
...in the Iron Hills.

851
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,008
Simple merchants, you say?

852
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,571
We need food...

853
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,808
...supplies, weapons.

854
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,201
Can you help us?

855
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,369
I know where these...

856
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,005
...barrels came from.

857
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,000
What of it?

858
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,686
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

859
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,929
...but I don't think it ended well.

860
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,283
No one enters Lake-town...

861
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,488
...but by leave of the Master.

862
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,885
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

863
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,925
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

864
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
Offer him more.

865
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,403
I'll wager there are...

866
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,563
...ways to enter that town unseen.

867
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,521
Aye.

868
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,120
But for that...

869
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,731
...you would need a smuggler.

870
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,883
For which we would pay double.

871
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,047
Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...

872
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,884
...the vast ignorance of the world...

873
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,441
...it festers and spreads.

874
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,411
A shadow that grows in the dark.

875
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,729
A sleepless malice as black...

876
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,884
...as the oncoming wall of night.

877
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,770
So it ever was.

878
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,568
So will it always be.

879
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,521
In time, all foul things come forth.

880
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,730
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

881
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,960
Why?

882
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,491
Not 13.

883
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,285
Not anymore.

884
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
The young one...

885
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,523
...the black-haired archer...

886
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,962
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

887
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,769
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

888
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,047
...choking on it soon.

889
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,649
Answer the question, filth.

890
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,769
I would not antagonize her.

891
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,169
You like killing things, Orc?

892
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,845
You like death?

893
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,280
Then let me give it to you.

894
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:12,760
I do not care about one...

895
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,645
...dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

896
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,209
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...

897
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,960
...what you know
and I will set you free.

898
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,921
You had orders to kill them. Why?

899
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,362
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

900
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,490
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

901
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,720
King?

902
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,963
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

903
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,487
None would dare enter Erebor...

904
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,800
...whilst the dragon lives.

905
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,650
You know nothing.

906
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,526
Your world will burn.

907
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,404
What are you talking about?

908
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,126
Speak!

909
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,370
Our time has come again.

910
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,288
My master serves the One.

911
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,206
Do you understand now, Elfling?

912
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,323
Death is upon you.

913
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,767
The flames of war...

914
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,650
...are upon you.

915
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,767
Why did you do that?

916
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,123
You promised to set him free.

917
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,486
And I did.

918
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,763
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

919
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:18,963
There was more...

920
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,964
...the Orc could tell us.

921
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,647
There was nothing more he could tell me.

922
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,080
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

923
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,047
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

924
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,442
...it will destroy all before it.

925
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,522
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

926
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,524
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

927
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,285
No one enters this kingdom.

928
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,965
And no one leaves it.

929
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,440
Watch out!

930
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:18,803
What are you trying...

931
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,730
...to do, drown us?

932
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,571
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.

933
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,211
If I wanted to drown you...

934
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,044
...I would not do it here.

935
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,521
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

936
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,531
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

937
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,246
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

938
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,251
Uh, I asked him.

939
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,091
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

940
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,890
We do not have to like him.

941
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,770
We simply have to pay him.

942
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,809
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

943
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,040
...your pockets.

944
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,850
How do we know he won't betray us?

945
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,320
We don't.

946
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,280
There's...

947
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,400
...just a wee problem.

948
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,045
We're 10 coins short.

949
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,200
Gloin.

950
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,083
Come on.

951
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,448
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

952
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,887
I have been bled dry...

953
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,201
...by this venture.

954
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,520
What have I seen...

955
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,046
...for my investment?

956
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,644
Naught but misery and...

957
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,880
...grief and...

958
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,088
Bless my beard.

959
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,081
Take it.

960
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,611
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

961
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,720
The money, quick. Give it to me.

962
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,528
We will pay you when we...

963
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,489
...get our provisions but not before.

964
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,200
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

965
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,926
There are guards ahead.

966
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,845
What's he doing?

967
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,400
He's talking to someone.

968
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,121
He's pointing right at us.

969
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,089
Now they're...

970
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:14,929
...shaking hands.

971
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,645
- What?
- The villain.

972
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,211
He's selling us out.

973
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
Quiet.

974
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,649
We're approaching the tollgate.

975
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Halt!

976
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,491
Goods inspection!

977
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,083
Papers, please!

978
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,080
Oh, it's you, Bard.

979
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,367
Morning, Percy.

980
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,806
Anything to declare?

981
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,811
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

982
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,127
...and ready for home.

983
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,600
You and me both.

984
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,131
There we are.

985
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,360
All in order.

986
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,284
Not so fast.

987
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,768
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."

988
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,240
Only...

989
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,770
...they're not empty...

990
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,806
...are they, Bard?

991
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,040
If I recall correctly...

992
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,567
...you're licensed as a bargeman.

993
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:41,520
Not...

994
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,200
...a fisherman.

995
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,925
That's none of your business.

996
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,640
Wrong.

997
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,287
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

998
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,091
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

999
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,561
These fish are illegal.

1000
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:57,969
Empty the barrels...

1001
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,407
...over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

1002
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,448
Come on. Get a move on.

1003
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,484
Folk in this town are struggling.

1004
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,246
Times are hard.

1005
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,520
Food is scarce.

1006
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,846
That's not my problem.

1007
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,280
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...

1008
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,970
...back in the lake...

1009
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,090
...when the rioting starts...

1010
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,285
...will it be your problem then?

1011
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,361
Stop.

1012
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,960
Ever the people's champion...

1013
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,202
...eh, Bard? Protector of...

1014
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,440
...the common folk.

1015
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,160
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...

1016
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,200
...but it won't last.

1017
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,486
Raise the gate!

1018
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,529
The Master has his eye on you.

1019
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,250
You'd do well to remember:

1020
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,045
We know where you live.

1021
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,964
It's a small town, Alfrid.

1022
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,728
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

1023
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,201
All this talk of civil unrest.

1024
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,124
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

1025
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,761
Gout playing up, sire?

1026
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It's the damp.

1027
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,600
It's the only possible explanation.

1028
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,041
Get me a brandy.

1029
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,730
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

1030
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:32,930
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

1031
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,800
It's not my fault they live in a place...

1032
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,691
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.

1033
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,370
Jobs, shelter, food.

1034
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,250
It's all they ever bleat about.

1035
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,121
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

1036
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,805
<i>Then</i> we must find these...

1037
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,003
...troublemakers and arrest them.

1038
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,163
My thoughts exactly, sire.

1039
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,244
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

1040
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,767
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...

1041
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,800
...and start making noises.
The next thing...

1042
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,884
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...

1043
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,724
...forming committees...

1044
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,125
...launching inquiries.

1045
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,840
Out with the old, in with the new?

1046
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,560
What?

1047
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
That's what they've been saying, sire.

1048
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,040
There is even talk...

1049
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,480
...of an election.

1050
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,926
An election? Heh.

1051
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,491
That's absurd.

1052
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,722
I won't stand for it. Ha!

1053
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,761
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, sire.

1054
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,210
Shirkers.

1055
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,440
Ingrates.

1056
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,647
Rabble-rousers.

1057
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,611
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

1058
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,525
Who would dare?

1059
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,761
Who...?

1060
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,045
Bard.

1061
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,450
You mark my words:

1062
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,324
That trouble-making bargeman...

1063
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,164
...is behind all this.

1064
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,208
No one else would have the...

1065
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,089
Bollocks...

1066
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,320
...sire.

1067
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,640
Ram and goat,
sautéed in a lovely little mushroom gravy.

1068
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,240
In an ideal world, sire, we'd arrest him.

1069
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,690
But Bard has the favor of the people.

1070
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,446
They see him as a leader.

1071
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,361
Someone they can truly admire.

1072
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,840
Modest...

1073
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,645
...intelligent...

1074
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,006
...handsome...

1075
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,605
...athletic...

1076
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,447
Yes, he's clearly modeling himself on me.

1077
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,762
That's no crime.

1078
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,526
I wonder...

1079
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,246
I wonder if some ancient law might exist...

1080
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,530
...that forbids bargemen
from asking questions.

1081
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,125
You think such a venerable statute
might exist?

1082
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,531
Almost certainly, sire.

1083
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,565
I'll write one immediately.

1084
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,407
You picked the wrong man...

1085
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:03,450
...to tangle with, Master Bard.

1086
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,689
I hope you're watching yourself...

1087
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,564
<i>...because I'll be watching you.</i>

1088
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,761
Get your hands off me.

1089
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,120
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

1090
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,404
The fish you can have for nothing.

1091
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,883
Stay close.

1092
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,606
Follow me.

1093
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,840
What is this place?

1094
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,884
This, Mr. Baggins, is the world of Men.

1095
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,406
Get it over here now.

1096
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,642
Grab the other end. That's it.

1097
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,091
Keep your head's down, keep moving.

1098
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,320
Quickly, now.

1099
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,444
God, how many more are there?

1100
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,880
Halt.

1101
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,288
Oi!

1102
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,129
Come on. Move.

1103
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,963
In the name...

1104
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:00,849
...of the Master of Lake-town...

1105
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,080
...I said halt.

1106
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,640
Halt!

1107
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Stop them!

1108
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
- Get back.
- Come here.

1109
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,565
What's going on here?

1110
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,167
Stay where you are. Nobody leaves.

1111
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:46,568
Braga.

1112
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,847
- Sorry?
- You.

1113
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,086
What are you up to, Bard?

1114
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,360
Me?

1115
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,480
Nothing.

1116
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,965
I'm looking for nothing.

1117
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,480
Yeah.

1118
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,444
Hey, Braga.

1119
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,690
Your wife would look lovely in this.

1120
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,131
What do you know of my wife?

1121
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,324
I know her as well
as any man in this town.

1122
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,361
Da!

1123
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,649
Our house, it's being watched.

1124
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,440
You can tell the Master
I'm done...

1125
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,640
...for the day.

1126
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,087
Da! Where have you been?

1127
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,330
Father! There you are! I was worried.

1128
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,091
Here, Sigrid.

1129
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,640
<i>Bah, get them in.</i>

1130
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,966
If you speak of this to anyone...

1131
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,645
...I'll rip your arms off.

1132
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,010
Get off.

1133
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,521
Up there.

1134
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,280
Da...

1135
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,601
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

1136
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,171
Will they bring us luck?

1137
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:01,602
They may not be the best fit...

1138
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,604
...but they'll keep you warm.

1139
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,327
Thank you very much.

1140
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,602
A Dwarvish windlance.

1141
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,489
You look like...

1142
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,046
...you've seen a ghost.

1143
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,961
He has.

1144
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:23,761
The last time we saw...

1145
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,684
...such a weapon...

1146
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,720
...a city was on fire.

1147
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,881
It was the day the dragon came.

1148
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,610
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

1149
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,966
<i>...destroyed Dale.</i>

1150
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,647
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

1151
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,642
<i>...rallied his bowmen...</i>

1152
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,006
<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

1153
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,889
But a dragon's hide is tough.

1154
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,642
Tougher than the strongest armor.

1155
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,089
Only a Black Arrow fired
from a windlance...

1156
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,924
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

1157
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,927
<i>And few of those...</i>

1158
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,969
<i>...arrows were ever made.</i>

1159
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,406
<i>The store was running low...</i>

1160
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,489
<i>...when Girion...</i>

1161
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,760
<i>...made his last stand.</i>

1162
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,122
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

1163
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,563
...much would have been different.

1164
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,603
You speak as if you were there.

1165
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,088
All Dwarves know the tale.

1166
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,607
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

1167
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,729
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

1168
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,920
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

1169
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,089
That's a fairy story, lad.

1170
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,731
Nothing more.

1171
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,085
You took our money.

1172
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,446
Where are the weapons?

1173
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,246
Wait here.

1174
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:07,448
Tomorrow begins...

1175
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,760
...the last days of autumn.

1176
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,207
Durin's Day falls the morn after next.

1177
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,363
We must reach the mountain before then.

1178
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,965
And if we do not?

1179
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,521
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

1180
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,240
Then this quest has been for nothing.

1181
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,806
What is this?

1182
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,646
Pike hook.

1183
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,041
Made from an old harpoon.

1184
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,802
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

1185
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,610
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

1186
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,365
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

1187
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:45,365
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

1188
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,362
We paid...

1189
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,329
...you for weapons.

1190
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,130
Iron-forged swords...

1191
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,361
...and axes!

1192
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,600
It's a joke!

1193
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:55,363
You won't find...

1194
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,250
...better outside the city armory.

1195
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,845
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

1196
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,326
...under lock and key.

1197
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,607
Thorin...

1198
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:02,968
...why not take what's...

1199
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,200
...on offer and go?

1200
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,566
I've made do with less.

1201
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,840
So have you.

1202
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,122
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

1203
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,360
What did you say?

1204
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,800
There are spies watching this house...

1205
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,725
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

1206
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:17,969
You must wait...

1207
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,200
...till nightfall.

1208
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,761
Thorin.

1209
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,926
Da?

1210
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,565
Don't let them leave.

1211
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:28,681
Tauriel...

1212
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,528
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

1213
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:32,800
...on your own.

1214
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,809
But I'm not on my own.

1215
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,926
You knew I would come.

1216
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,560
The king is angry...

1217
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,449
...Tauriel. For 600 years...

1218
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,409
...my father has protected you,
favored you.

1219
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,885
You defied his orders.

1220
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,531
You betrayed his trust.

1221
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,090
The king has never let Orc filth...

1222
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,320
...roam our lands.

1223
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,808
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

1224
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,366
It is not our fight.

1225
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,125
It is our fight.

1226
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,369
It will not end here.

1227
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,490
With every victory, this evil will grow.

1228
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,491
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

1229
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,842
We will hide within our walls...

1230
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,401
...live our lives away from the light...

1231
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,205
...and let darkness descend.

1232
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,969
Are we not part of this world?

1233
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,366
<i>Tell me, mellon.</i>

1234
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,082
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

1235
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:40,691
Hello, Bard. What you after?

1236
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,290
There was a tapestry!

1237
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,128
An old one! Where's it gone?

1238
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,640
What tapestry you talking about?

1239
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,920
This one.

1240
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,120
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...

1241
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,320
...out of nowhere.

1242
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,562
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

1243
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,444
I've never seen the like.

1244
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,802
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

1245
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,640
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

1246
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,689
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

1247
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,525
Prophecy.

1248
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,361
Prophecy.

1249
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,886
The old tales will come true.

1250
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,401
Vast halls of treasure!

1251
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,802
Silver and gold and jewels beyond measure.

1252
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,080
Can you imagine?

1253
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,441
Can it really be true?

1254
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,411
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

1255
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,291
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

1256
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,807
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

1257
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,644
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

1258
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,763
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

1259
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,969
<i>And the bell shall ring in gladness</i>

1260
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:46,803
<i>At the Mountain</i>

1261
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,565
<i>King's return</i>

1262
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,531
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

1263
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,851
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

1264
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,840
Da, I tried to stop them.

1265
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,485
How long have they been gone?

1266
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,320
- Can you see anything?
- Shh! Keep it down.

1267
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,840
As soon as we have the weapons...

1268
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,485
...we make straight for the mountain.

1269
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,926
Go, go, go.

1270
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,481
Go, Nori.

1271
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,601
Next.

1272
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,080
<i>Prophecy?</i>

1273
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,528
Who dragged up that old nonsense?

1274
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,489
People, sire.

1275
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,721
They're gathering in the streets.

1276
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,043
They're saying that a king will return
to the Lonely Mountain...

1277
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,001
...and that the rivers will once more
run with gold.

1278
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,567
Rivers of gold? Poppycock.

1279
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,601
As you say, sire.

1280
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,680
But people will believe
what they want to believe.

1281
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,286
It's been a long time
since they've seen any riches.

1282
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,922
The old tales offer them hope.

1283
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,881
You all right?

1284
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,406
I can manage.

1285
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,764
Let's just get out of here.

1286
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,760
Run!

1287
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,006
Quickly! Move now!

1288
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,366
Get off me! Get off!

1289
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,204
Move them along here.

1290
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,321
Move on!

1291
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,450
What is the meaning of this?

1292
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,807
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.

1293
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,321
Ah. Enemies of the state, eh?

1294
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,560
A desperate bunch of...

1295
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,762
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

1296
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,240
Hold your tongue!

1297
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,922
You do not know to whom you speak.

1298
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,409
This is no common criminal.

1299
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,045
This is Thorin...

1300
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,409
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1301
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,642
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1302
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,523
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1303
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,244
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

1304
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,608
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

1305
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,251
...filled with silks and fine gems.

1306
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,847
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1307
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,565
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

1308
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:48,969
I would...

1309
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,446
...see those days return.

1310
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,206
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

1311
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,407
...and send wealth and riches...

1312
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,120
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

1313
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,120
Death!

1314
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,921
That is what you will...

1315
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,446
...bring upon us!

1316
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,004
Dragon fire and ruin.

1317
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,369
If you waken that beast...

1318
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,604
...it will destroy us all.

1319
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,683
You can listen to this naysayer...

1320
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,570
...but I promise you this:

1321
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,405
If we succeed...

1322
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,286
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

1323
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,729
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

1324
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,206
...10 times over!

1325
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,842
Why should we take you at your word?

1326
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,730
We know nothing about you.

1327
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,160
Who here can vouch for your character?

1328
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,920
Me.

1329
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,040
I'll vouch for him.

1330
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,126
I have traveled far...

1331
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,482
...with these Dwarves
through great danger...

1332
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:12,963
...and if Thorin Oakenshield...

1333
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,366
...gives his word...

1334
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,482
...then he will keep it.

1335
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,441
All of you!

1336
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,921
Listen to me!

1337
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,207
You must listen!

1338
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,169
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

1339
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,080
Have you forgotten those...

1340
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,208
...who died in the firestorm?!

1341
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,480
And for what purpose?

1342
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,729
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1343
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,602
...so riven by greed, he could not...

1344
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,365
...see beyond his own desire!

1345
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,204
Now, now!

1346
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,488
We must not, any of us...

1347
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:50,087
...be too quick to lay blame.

1348
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:51,809
Let us...

1349
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,769
...not forget that it was...

1350
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,809
...Girion, Lord of Dale...

1351
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,730
...your ancestor...

1352
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,480
...who failed to kill the beast!

1353
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,008
It's true, sire.

1354
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,446
We all know the story.

1355
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,724
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

1356
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,531
Each one missing its mark.

1357
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,566
You have no right.

1358
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,163
No right to enter that mountain.

1359
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,008
I have the only right.

1360
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,725
I speak to the Master...

1361
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,450
...of the Men of the Lake.

1362
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,001
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1363
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,960
Will you...

1364
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:46,046
...share in the great wealth
of our people?

1365
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,485
What say you?

1366
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:59,409
I say unto you...

1367
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,681
Welcome!

1368
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,200
Welcome!

1369
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:04,240
And thrice...

1370
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,481
...welcome...

1371
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,370
...King Under the Mountain!

1372
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,966
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

1373
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,806
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1374
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,047
If we're to find the door before...

1375
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,851
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

1376
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,240
Not you.

1377
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:37,047
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1378
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,200
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1379
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,360
Not now.

1380
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,840
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1381
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,160
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1382
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,521
Kili, stay here.

1383
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,281
Rest.

1384
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,525
Join us when you're healed.

1385
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,451
I'll stay with the lad.

1386
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,489
My duty lies with the wounded.

1387
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,720
Uncle.

1388
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,289
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

1389
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:11,806
Tales you told us.

1390
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,160
You cannot take that away...

1391
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,201
...from him!
- Fili.

1392
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,520
I will carry him if I must!

1393
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,161
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1394
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:22,208
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.

1395
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,284
Not even my own kin.

1396
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:29,960
Fili, don't be a fool.

1397
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,920
You belong with the company.

1398
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,690
I belong with my brother.

1399
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,046
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

1400
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:53,169
Go now with our goodwill...

1401
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,811
...and good wishes.

1402
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,930
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!

1403
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,286
...to all!

1404
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,767
Goodbye.

1405
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:12,843
Out of the way!

1406
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,445
No! No!

1407
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,088
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

1408
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,881
Kili? Kili!

1409
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,725
<i>Hey-</i>

1410
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,889
Get out of there. Go on.

1411
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,324
Masterfully handled, sire.

1412
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,528
Your popularity has never been so high.

1413
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,723
The entire town twittering your name.

1414
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,803
Yes, it was rather clever.

1415
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,202
Either our little friends
return triumphant...

1416
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,410
...in which case,
I stand to make a pretty penny...

1417
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,763
...or old Smaug dines on Dwarf
for a day or two.

1418
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,649
The important thing is,
they're off our hands.

1419
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Please, wait.

1420
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,286
Please. We need your help.

1421
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,090
- My brother is sick.
- Sick?

1422
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,600
Is it infectious?

1423
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,568
Get back.

1424
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,370
Alfrid, Alfrid...

1425
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,400
- ...don't let them come any closer.
- Please.

1426
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,124
We need medicine.

1427
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,164
Do I look like an apothecary?

1428
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,006
Haven't we given you enough?

1429
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,401
The master's a busy man.

1430
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,484
He hasn't got time to worry
about sick Dwarves.

1431
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,160
Be gone with you. Go on.

1432
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,646
Clear off.

1433
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,003
What this town needs,
Alfrid, is a good purge.

1434
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:25,165
Starting with a certain troublemaker
who saw fit to question my authority.

1435
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,131
- A certain bargeman, sire?
- Precisely.

1436
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,721
No.

1437
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,610
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1438
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,443
No, no...

1439
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,680
...no! Please!

1440
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,286
No one will help us. Kili's sick.

1441
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:41,961
He's very sick.

1442
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,482
So quiet.

1443
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,724
Wasn't always like this.

1444
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:32,126
Once, these slopes
were lined with woodlands.

1445
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:33,566
The trees...

1446
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,121
...were filled with birdsong.

1447
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,406
Relax, Master Baggins.

1448
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:46,280
We have food, we have tools,
and we're making good time.

1449
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,290
What is this place?

1450
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,920
It was once the city of Dale.

1451
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,484
Now it is a ruin.

1452
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,447
The desolation of Smaug.

1453
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,603
The sun will soon reach midday.

1454
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,280
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1455
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:15,360
This way.

1456
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,488
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1457
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,165
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1458
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,240
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?

1459
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:22,363
We have no time...

1460
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,011
...to wait upon the Wizard.

1461
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,044
We're on our own. Come!

1462
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,924
Dol Guldur.

1463
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,362
The Hill of Sorcery.

1464
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,841
It looks completely abandoned.

1465
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,565
As it is meant to.

1466
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,045
A spell of concealment...

1467
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:57,363
...lies over this place, which means...

1468
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,683
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.

1469
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:06,008
He has not regained his full strength.

1470
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:09,808
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

1471
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:12,247
Tell her we must force his hand.

1472
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,561
What do you mean?

1473
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,370
I'm going in alone.

1474
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,121
On no account come after me.

1475
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,566
Do I have your word?

1476
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,802
Yes, yes, yes!

1477
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,010
Wait, Gandalf!

1478
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,083
What if it's a trap?!

1479
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,925
Turn around and do not come back.

1480
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,644
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1481
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:40,728
Anything?

1482
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:42,883
Nothing.

1483
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,601
If the map is true...

1484
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,325
...the hidden door lies directly above us.

1485
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,489
Up here!

1486
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:08,291
You have keen eyes, Mr. Baggins.

1487
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,882
Thrain?

1488
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,360
Son of Thror?

1489
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,490
My old friend.

1490
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:22,808
Gandalf?

1491
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,767
A lifetime.

1492
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:37,246
I have been here a lifetime.

1493
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:38,925
I'm so sorry...

1494
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:41,049
...I gave you up for dead.

1495
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,931
I had a son.

1496
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,404
I Will fight with you.

1497
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,640
Thorin.

1498
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,969
And you will see him again, my friend.

1499
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:02,288
Come, we must leave.

1500
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,921
The Orcs had taken Moria.

1501
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,362
War. We were at war.

1502
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,087
I was surrounded.

1503
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,725
The Defiler.

1504
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,403
Azog the Defiler...

1505
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,802
...had come.

1506
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,682
They took it.

1507
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,127
The last of the seven.

1508
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,360
Come on, let's get you out of here.

1509
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,480
There is no way out.

1510
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,648
They will stop you.

1511
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:27,880
The serpents...

1512
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,327
...will stop you.

1513
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:34,721
It's an illusion.

1514
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,489
Just an illusion.

1515
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,643
What have they done to you?

1516
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,921
I never told them.

1517
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:49,164
They tried to make me,
but I never said a word.

1518
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:55,805
Have you kept them safe, Gandalf?
The map and the key?

1519
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,921
I gave them to Thorin.

1520
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,400
You'd be proud of him.

1521
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,887
He's taken up the quest to reclaim Erebor.

1522
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:03,120
Erebor.

1523
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,285
He will retrieve the Arkenstone.

1524
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,880
The seven armies of the Dwarves...

1525
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
...will answer...

1526
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:09,525
...to a new king.
- No. No.

1527
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,922
Thorin must not go near Erebor.

1528
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:16,210
No one must enter that mountain.

1529
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,801
This must be it.

1530
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,525
The hidden door.

1531
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,524
Let all those who doubted us...

1532
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,045
...rue this day!

1533
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,206
Right, then. We have a key.

1534
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,410
Which means that somewhere...

1535
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,931
...there is a key-hole.

1536
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:18,530
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1537
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:21,520
...will shine upon...

1538
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:23,011
...the key-hole."

1539
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,241
Nori.

1540
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,808
We're losing the light. Come on.

1541
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,926
Be quiet! I can't
hear when you're thumping.

1542
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,160
I can't find it.

1543
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:54,765
It's not here!

1544
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,081
It's not here!

1545
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,200
- Break it down!
- Aye.

1546
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:01,920
Come on!

1547
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:04,642
Break!

1548
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,881
It has to break.

1549
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,171
It's no good.

1550
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:10,920
The door's sealed. Can't
be opened by force.

1551
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,800
There's a powerful magic on it.

1552
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,446
No!

1553
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,087
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1554
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,530
...will shine upon the key-hole."

1555
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,564
That is what it says.

1556
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:47,485
What did we miss?

1557
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,885
What did we miss?

1558
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,920
Balin?

1559
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,249
We've lost the light.

1560
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,603
There's no more to be done.

1561
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:03,729
We had but...

1562
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,240
...one chance.

1563
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:08,926
Come away, lads.

1564
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:10,969
It's over.

1565
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:14,168
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

1566
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,091
Where are they going?

1567
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,769
You can't give up now!

1568
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:37,841
Thorin.

1569
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:41,564
You can't give up now.

1570
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:55,487
"Stand by the gray stone...

1571
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,442
...when the thrush knocks."

1572
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,611
The setting sun.

1573
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:05,530
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine..."

1574
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,490
The last light.

1575
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,411
Last light.

1576
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:50,320
The last light!

1577
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,686
The key-hole!

1578
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,200
Come back!

1579
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,891
Come back!

1580
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:07,322
It's the light of the moon! The last...

1581
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:10,643
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

1582
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,961
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?

1583
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,929
It was here.

1584
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,969
Come on, it was... It was here.

1585
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,680
It was just...

1586
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,965
Erebor.

1587
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:21,806
Thorin.

1588
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,089
I know these walls.

1589
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:42,365
These halls.

1590
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,771
This stone.

1591
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:51,283
You remember it...

1592
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:52,686
...Balin.

1593
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,806
Chambers filled with golden light.

1594
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:02,170
I remember.

1595
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:16,771
"Herein lies...

1596
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:18,929
...the Seventh Kingdom of...

1597
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:20,321
...Durin's Folk.

1598
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:25,363
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

1599
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:29,207
...Dwarves in defense of this home."

1600
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:32,763
The Throne of the King.

1601
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,765
Ah.

1602
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,802
And what's that above it?

1603
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,089
The Arkenstone.

1604
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,811
Arkenstone.

1605
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,085
And what's that?

1606
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,370
That, Master Burglar...

1607
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,448
...is why you are here.

1608
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,049
Can you not do something?

1609
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:22,521
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

1610
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,127
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1611
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,210
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1612
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,442
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

1613
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,006
Pigs?

1614
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:33,406
Weed.

1615
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,286
Right.

1616
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:37,401
Don't move.

1617
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:43,727
You want me to find a jewel?

1618
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,009
A large, white jewel.

1619
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,566
Yes.

1620
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:52,531
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1621
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:56,089
There is only one Arkenstone...

1622
02:07:56,840 --> 02:07:58,922
...and you'll know it when you see it.

1623
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,166
Right.

1624
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:05,523
In truth...

1625
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:06,760
...lad...

1626
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,488
...I do not know...

1627
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:11,802
...what you will find down there.

1628
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,083
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1629
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,320
No, Balin.

1630
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:21,568
I promised I would do this...

1631
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:23,969
...and I think I must try.

1632
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:30,369
It never ceases to amaze me.

1633
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:31,600
What's that?

1634
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,364
The courage of Hobbits.

1635
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,000
Go now...

1636
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,525
...with as much luck as you can muster.

1637
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,006
Oh, Bilbo?

1638
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:54,727
If there is, in fact...

1639
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:57,240
...a live dragon...

1640
02:08:57,320 --> 02:08:58,367
...down there...

1641
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,811
...don't waken it.

1642
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:25,081
He is waiting for them.

1643
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,600
They are in league.

1644
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,923
The dragon and the One.

1645
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,571
Hurry. We must hurry.

1646
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,485
Where is your master?

1647
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:58,361
Where is he?!

1648
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,250
He is here.

1649
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,200
Tell Thorin...

1650
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:03,402
...that I loved him.

1651
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:04,801
Will you do that?

1652
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:08,721
Will you tell my son that I loved him?

1653
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,128
You will tell him yourself.

1654
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,570
It is too late.

1655
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:40,970
Sauron!

1656
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:04,641
Hello?

1657
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:25,091
He's not at home.

1658
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:27,724
Not at home. Ahem.

1659
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,641
Good.

1660
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:33,169
Good, good, good.

1661
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,360
What's that?

1662
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:34,008
Shush. Shush.

1663
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,606
Arkenstone.

1664
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:39,051
Arkenstone.

1665
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:41,928
A large, white jewel.

1666
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:45,485
Very helpful.

1667
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,491
Well...

1668
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,446
...thief.

1669
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:21,081
I smell you.

1670
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:24,649
I hear your breath.

1671
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,564
I feel...

1672
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:28,840
...your air.

1673
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:35,206
Where are you?

1674
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:37,761
Where are you?

1675
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:58,881
Come, now...

1676
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:01,768
...don't be shy.

1677
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:04,247
Step into the light.

1678
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:09,440
Hmm.

1679
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:14,369
There is something about you.

1680
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:18,760
Something you...

1681
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,800
...carry.

1682
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,690
Something made of gold.

1683
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:27,364
But far more...

1684
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:29,409
...precious.

1685
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:31,961
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1686
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,921
There you are...

1687
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:37,725
...Thief in the...

1688
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:39,803
...Shadows.

1689
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:44,246
I did not come to steal from you...

1690
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:45,480
...O Smaug...

1691
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:48,763
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

1692
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:50,644
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

1693
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
To see...

1694
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:55,050
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

1695
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:57,489
I did not believe them.

1696
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:10,245
And do you now?!

1697
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:12,840
Truly...

1698
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,367
...the tales and songs...

1699
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:20,211
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

1700
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:23,410
...O Smaug the Stupendous.

1701
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:26,530
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1702
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:28,040
No, no.

1703
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,730
No, indeed.

1704
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,243
You seem familiar with my name...

1705
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:38,370
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

1706
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:41,084
Who are you...

1707
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:43,846
...and where do you come from...

1708
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,401
...may I ask?

1709
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:57,644
I come from under the hill.

1710
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,411
Underhill?

1711
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:04,120
And under hills...

1712
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,242
...and over hills my path has led.

1713
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:08,120
And... And...

1714
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:11,087
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1715
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,049
Impressive.

1716
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,328
What else do you claim to be?

1717
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,280
I am...

1718
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,810
Luck-wearer.

1719
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,401
Riddle-maker.

1720
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,330
Lovely titles.

1721
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,201
Go on.

1722
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:29,561
Barrel-rider.

1723
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,202
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1724
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:35,408
And what about...

1725
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:38,610
...your little Dwarf friends?

1726
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:40,960
Where are they hiding?

1727
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,410
Dwarves?

1728
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:47,321
No.

1729
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,525
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1730
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,841
You've got that all wrong.

1731
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:54,886
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1732
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:56,680
They sent you in here...

1733
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,928
...to do their dirty work while they...

1734
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:01,128
...skulk about outside.

1735
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:03,521
Truly...

1736
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:05,481
...you are mistaken...

1737
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:08,764
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

1738
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,402
You have nice manners...

1739
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,608
...for a thief and...

1740
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:15,840
...a liar!

1741
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:20,522
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1742
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,166
No one better!

1743
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:25,291
It is the gold!

1744
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,282
They are drawn...

1745
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:27,567
...to treasure like...

1746
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:29,370
...flies to dead flesh.

1747
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:34,160
Did you think I did not know...

1748
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:36,090
...this day would come?!

1749
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:39,246
That a pack of...

1750
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:40,811
...canting Dwarves...

1751
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,361
...would come crawling back...

1752
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,160
...to the mountain?!

1753
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:50,926
Was that an earthquake?

1754
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:53,288
That, my lad...

1755
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:57,965
...was a dragon.

1756
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,280
Da?

1757
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,964
It's coming from the mountain.

1758
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:14,280
You should leave us.

1759
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:15,209
Take your children.

1760
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:16,440
Get out of here.

1761
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,286
And go where?

1762
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:20,771
There is nowhere to go.

1763
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,245
Are we going to die, Da?

1764
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,441
No, darling.

1765
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:28,289
The dragon.

1766
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,005
It's going to kill us.

1767
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:42,489
Not if I kill it first.

1768
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,606
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

1769
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,524
I took his throne.

1770
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:50,880
I ate his...

1771
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:53,845
...people like a wolf among sheep.

1772
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,761
I kill where...

1773
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:00,644
...I wish, when...

1774
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:02,365
...I Wish.

1775
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:05,922
My armor is iron.

1776
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:17,526
No blade can pierce me.

1777
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:21,920
All right.

1778
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:24,527
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me?

1779
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:26,410
Because you did not need to know.

1780
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,525
Listen to me carefully.

1781
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:38,042
I need you to distract the guards.

1782
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:39,203
Once I'm at the top of...

1783
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:41,727
...the tower, I'll set
the arrow to the bow.

1784
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:42,569
There he is!

1785
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:43,409
Bard!

1786
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,847
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1787
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,080
Stop him!

1788
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,120
Stop him!

1789
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:56,840
Stop!

1790
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,250
<i>Bain! Bain.</i>

1791
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:06,766
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

1792
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,729
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1793
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:13,329
Braga.

1794
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,209
You're under arrest.

1795
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:17,330
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1796
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:48,731
Where's he gone?

1797
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,081
What about Bilbo?

1798
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:02,321
Give him more time.

1799
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,722
Time to do what? To be killed?

1800
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:08,440
You're afraid.

1801
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:12,407
Yes, I'm afraid.

1802
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,925
I fear for you.

1803
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:18,442
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1804
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:19,880
A sickness which drove...

1805
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,206
...your grandfather mad.

1806
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:23,050
I am not my grandfather.

1807
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,044
You're not yourself.

1808
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,048
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

1809
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:28,889
I will not risk...

1810
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:32,920
...this quest for the life of one burglar.

1811
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,245
Bilbo.

1812
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:38,523
His name is Bilbo.

1813
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:44,089
It's Oakenshield...

1814
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,330
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1815
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,722
He sent you in here...

1816
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:54,725
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1817
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:55,609
No. No...

1818
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:58,730
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1819
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,086
Don't bother denying it.

1820
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:03,289
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.

1821
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:07,484
But it matters not.

1822
02:26:08,640 --> 02:26:11,007
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1823
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,764
The darkness is coming.

1824
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:19,605
<i>It will spread to every corner of the land.</i>

1825
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,168
You are being used, Thief...

1826
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:06,528
...in the Shadows.
You were only...

1827
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:09,366
...ever a means to an end.

1828
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:10,803
The coward...

1829
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,611
...Oakenshield has weighed...

1830
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:15,450
...the value of your life...

1831
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:17,882
...and found it worth nothing.

1832
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:19,686
No.

1833
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:21,400
No.

1834
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:23,360
No, you're lying.

1835
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:24,761
What did he promise you?

1836
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:27,282
A share of the treasure?

1837
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:29,441
As if it was his...

1838
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,761
...to give.

1839
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,364
I will not part with...

1840
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:34,601
...a single coin.

1841
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,806
Not one piece of it.

1842
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:42,680
My teeth...

1843
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,006
...are swords.

1844
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:48,202
My claws are spears.

1845
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:51,481
My Wings...

1846
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:54,646
...are a hurricane.

1847
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:02,123
So it is true.

1848
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:04,642
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1849
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:05,880
What did you say?

1850
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:10,531
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

1851
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:11,966
...the Tyrannical.

1852
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:13,641
Truly.

1853
02:28:13,880 --> 02:28:15,848
You have no equal on this earth.

1854
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:20,929
I am...

1855
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:24,443
...almost tempted to let you take it.

1856
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,882
If only to see Oakenshield...

1857
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:28,160
...suffer.

1858
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:30,281
Watch it...

1859
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:32,045
...destroy him.

1860
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:35,649
Watch it corrupt his heart...

1861
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,721
...and drive him mad.

1862
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,490
But I think not.

1863
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:46,321
I think our little game ends here.

1864
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:48,400
So tell me...

1865
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:49,680
...thief...

1866
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:52,568
...how do you choose to die?

1867
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Nah.

1868
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:07,248
Da? Is that you, Da?

1869
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:41,691
- Aah!
- Stay down!

1870
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:43,520
Get down!

1871
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:20,881
You killed them all.

1872
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:22,201
There are others.

1873
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:23,721
Tauriel.

1874
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:25,326
Come.

1875
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:30,360
We're losing him.

1876
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:35,446
Tauriel.

1877
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:00,361
Athelas.

1878
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,645
Athelas.

1879
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:06,721
What are you doing?

1880
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,449
I'm going to save him.

1881
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:33,680
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1882
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,730
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.

1883
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:41,250
Did you find it?

1884
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:47,841
We have to get out.

1885
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:52,561
Thorin.

1886
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:57,406
Thorin.

1887
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,968
You will burn!

1888
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:32,120
- Run!
- Ah!

1889
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:40,201
Come on, Bilbo!

1890
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,127
Come on.

1891
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:12,486
Hold him down.

1892
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:30,609
Unh! Tilda.

1893
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:24,686
Shh, Shh, Shh!

1894
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:33,965
We've given him the slip.

1895
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:35,201
No.

1896
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,887
He's too cunning for that.

1897
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:40,766
So where to now?

1898
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:42,691
The western guardroom.

1899
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:44,925
There may be a way out.

1900
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,202
It's too high. There's no chance...

1901
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:49,522
...that way.
- it's our only chance.

1902
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,330
We have to try.

1903
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:10,041
Come on.

1904
02:37:57,560 --> 02:38:01,326
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.

1905
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:04,291
That was a privilege to witness.

1906
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:07,921
Tauriel.

1907
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,446
Lie still.

1908
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:22,768
You cannot be her.

1909
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:28,402
She is far away.

1910
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:34,011
She is far...

1911
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:35,844
...far away from me.

1912
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:39,608
She walks...

1913
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:42,525
...in starlight in another world.

1914
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,808
It was just a dream.

1915
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:03,721
Do you think she could've loved me?

1916
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:12,040
Stay close.

1917
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:23,440
That's it, then.

1918
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:26,323
There's no way out.

1919
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:34,961
The last of our kin.

1920
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,722
They must have come here...

1921
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:42,447
...hoping...

1922
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:43,841
...beyond hope.

1923
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,921
We could try to reach the mines.

1924
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:59,001
We might last a few days.

1925
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:02,207
No.

1926
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:07,401
I will not die like this.

1927
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:09,921
Cowering.

1928
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,609
Clawing for breath.

1929
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:18,646
We make for the forges.

1930
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:20,888
He'll see us, sure as death.

1931
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:22,360
Not if we split up.

1932
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:23,600
Thorin...

1933
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:25,330
...we'll never make it.

1934
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:27,085
Some of us might.

1935
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,721
Lead him to the forges.

1936
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:32,482
We kill the dragon.

1937
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:36,487
If this is to end in fire...

1938
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:39,321
...then we will all burn together.

1939
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:41,801
This way.

1940
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:47,280
Flee.

1941
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:48,960
Flee.

1942
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:51,848
Run for your lives.

1943
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:53,600
There is...

1944
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:56,327
...nowhere to hide.

1945
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:57,560
Behind you!

1946
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:58,760
Worm!

1947
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:00,760
Come on!

1948
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:03,847
Run!

1949
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:07,086
Hey, you!

1950
02:41:07,440 --> 02:41:08,440
Here!

1951
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,128
This way. It's this way!

1952
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:09,526
Come on!

1953
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:10,760
Thorin!

1954
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,246
Follow Balin!

1955
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:19,680
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1956
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:36,885
Thorin!

1957
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:47,007
Hold on!

1958
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:22,171
Thorin!

1959
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,610
Go. Go!

1960
02:45:30,320 --> 02:45:34,006
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1961
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:35,605
He's right. We've no...

1962
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:38,161
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

1963
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,085
Have we not?

1964
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:46,564
I did not look to see you
so easily outwitted.

1965
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,169
You have grown...

1966
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:53,368
...slow and fat...

1967
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:55,200
...in your dotage...

1968
02:45:57,520 --> 02:45:58,681
...slug!

1969
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:01,764
Take cover. Go!

1970
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:29,883
Bombur!

1971
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:31,611
Get those bellows working.

1972
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:32,966
Go!

1973
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:47,329
Bilbo!

1974
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,329
Up there. On my mark...

1975
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:50,886
...pull that lever.

1976
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:03,721
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

1977
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:06,361
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

1978
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:09,565
We don't have a jiffy.

1979
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:22,646
Where's the sulfur?

1980
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,040
You sure you know what...

1981
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:25,120
...you're doing?

1982
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,560
Come on!

1983
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:00,640
Now!

1984
02:49:57,080 --> 02:49:59,162
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1985
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:48,241
Keep going, Bilbo!

1986
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:49,881
Run!

1987
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:36,201
You think you...

1988
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:38,408
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1989
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:44,964
You have come from Lake-town.

1990
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:47,966
This is some...

1991
02:51:48,200 --> 02:51:51,488
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

1992
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:54,883
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1993
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:57,803
Those sniveling cowards...

1994
02:51:58,040 --> 02:51:59,530
...with their long bows...

1995
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:02,604
...and Black Arrows.

1996
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:04,849
Perhaps it is time...

1997
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:07,009
...I paid them a visit.

1998
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:08,760
Oh, no.

1999
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,130
This isn't their fault!

2000
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:13,360
Wait!

2001
02:52:13,400 --> 02:52:15,004
You cannot go to Lake-town!

2002
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:19,082
You care about them...

2003
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:21,040
you?

2004
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:22,280
Good.

2005
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:23,563
Then you can...

2006
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:25,370
...watch them die.

2007
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:32,046
Here!

2008
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:33,960
You witless worm.

2009
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:42,211
You.

2010
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:45,080
I am taking back what you stole.

2011
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:49,769
You...

2012
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:51,610
...will take nothing...

2013
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:53,530
...from me...

2014
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:54,961
...Dwarf.

2015
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:58,728
I laid low your warriors...

2016
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:00,564
...of old.

2017
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:03,207
I instilled terror in...

2018
02:53:03,440 --> 02:53:05,124
...the hearts of Men.

2019
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:07,725
I am...

2020
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:09,325
...King Under...

2021
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:11,649
...the Mountain.

2022
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:14,367
This is not your kingdom.

2023
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:16,602
These are Dwarf lands.

2024
02:53:17,360 --> 02:53:18,360
This is Dwarf gold.

2025
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:21,408
And we will...

2026
02:53:21,640 --> 02:53:23,802
...have our revenge.

2027
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:46,360
Revenge?!

2028
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:49,650
Revenge?!

2029
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:54,365
I will show you revenge!

2030
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:32,887
Listen to me!

2031
02:55:33,440 --> 02:55:35,727
Do you not know what is coming?

2032
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:41,881
I am fire.

2033
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:45,560
I am...

2034
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:49,131
...death.

2035
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:00,047
What have we done?
