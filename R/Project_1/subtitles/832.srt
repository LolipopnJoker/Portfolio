I'm looking forward

I'm sure it's a wonderful,

As you know, for the past three years,

56

to formulate a National Energy Policy

on the way we live

To make sure
that we choose the right path,

60
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:42,230
the President has appointed
as his top advisor in this area,

61
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,858
Dr Albert S. Meinheimer.

62
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:53,408
As I'm sure you're aware, his reputation
in this field is without peer,

63
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:56,995

will present his recommendations

on Dr Meinheimer's recommendations.

72

This issue is too important to be left to
politicians or special interests to decide.

We need an independent and informed
source on which to base future actions,

and Dr Meinheimer
is the recognised expert in this field.

76

won't be influenced...

And breasts that seem to say,
"Hey, look at these!"

that you were a man. Yeah...

- Jane. I didn't know you lived here.

170
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,426
I moved here two years ago.

171
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:37,348
- How are the children?
- We didn't have any children.

172
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,267
Yes, of course.

173
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,937
- How was your prostate operation?
- Fine. As good as new.

174
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,565
In fact, better than ever.

175
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,358
Look, Frank...

176
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:51,904
I know it's awkward, but you're not still
obsessed with our relationship, are you?

177
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:54,282
Obsessed? Who's obsessed?

178
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,952
Because you backed out of the wedding
two years ago? I'd forgotten.

179
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,913
Ancient history,
like the Democratic Party.

180
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:03,750
He was in tears.
In church, crying like a baby.

181
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,711
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I had to return 13 Cuisinarts.

182
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:09,172
- That's enough.
- I kept the salad shooter, though.

183
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,090
MEINHEIMER: Jane, there you are.

184
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:13,051
Hello, Jane.

185
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:16,804
Dr Meinheimer.
Frank, this is Dr Albert Meinheimer.

186
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,433
- Don't get up. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

187
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,394
I believe we met
at the White House dinner.

188
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:27,106
He never forgets a face.
He has a photographic memory.

189
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,277
It's a terrible thing that's happened.
I hope you find the people responsible.

190
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,531
I'm sorry I can't be more optimistic,
but we have a long road ahead of us.

191
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:40,203
It's like sex, a painstaking task
that seems to go on and on forever,

192
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,998
and when you think that things are
going your way, nothing happens.

193
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:48,628
Jane, about this man
you saw last night... Anything can help.

194
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,797
I gave the sketch artist a description.

195
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:59,013
Eh... Ed! That'll be all, McTigue.

196
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:05,478
We should get that other artist. The one
that never dates and lives with two guys.

197
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,438
Right. Sorenson!

198
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:11,526
I'd like to see the rest of the Institute,
if you don't mind?

199
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,195
Of course.
We should start with the research area.

200
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,448
That's a good idea. It's right this way.

201
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:22,161
What can you tell me
about the man you saw last night?

202
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,664
- He's Caucasian.
- Caucasian?

203
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:29,127
Yeah. You know, white guy.
With a moustache, about 6'3".

204
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,921
An awfully big moustache.
What's this all about?

205
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,465
JANE: This is our research laboratory.

206
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,467
There are hundreds of experiments
going on,

207
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:39,595
all temperature-controlled
by the machinery just below us.

208
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,225
Our scientists have spent years on them
and are just now making breakthroughs.

209
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,936
MEINHEIMER:
Today, we'll join two compounds...

210
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:48,229

00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,067
MAN: Oh, my God!

212
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:56,571
Thank heavens the bomb
didn't damage the research area.

213
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:59,866
Yes, but I can't understand
who'd do such a thing.

214
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,869
Jane, I think you
ought to know something.

215
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,246
- Jane, darling!
- Quentin!

216
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:09,417
Jane, are you all right?
I was so worried about you.

217
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,379
I'm really okay, but I'm glad you're here.

218
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,756
Oh, I'm sorry!

219
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,010
Frank, this is Quentin Hapsburg
of the Hexagon Oil Company.

220
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:22,680
- Pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Drebin. Frank Drebin.

221
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,266
I believe I've used
some of your restrooms.

222
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:28,769
I'm sure you have.

223
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:32,773
- Are you connected with the Institute?
- Not officially.

224
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:36,736
But Jane and I have seen
quite a lot of each other lately.

225
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,030
- How is my little hell-cat?
- Oh!

226
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:45,119
Well, that's great. I've been dating, too.
Nice girl, an author.

227
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,539
Wrote the book on male sexual
dysfunction. You've probably read it.

228
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:50,791
- I beg your pardon?
- Please...

229
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,544
I'm sure we can
handle the situation maturely,

230
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:56,047
just like the responsible adults
that we are.

231
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:59,175
Isn't that right, Mr Poopy Pants?

232
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:01,177
- That does it!
- Frank!

233
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,180
Quentin, maybe you should excuse us.

234
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:07,475
Anything you wish, my darling.

235
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,811
Until tonight, then...

236
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:36,837
(SINGING) I'm feeling blue

237
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:43,761
Just thinking of you

238
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:47,848
I get out of bed

239
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:54,355
Wish I was dead

240
00:17:54,523 --> 00:18:00,361
And I hope you do, too

241
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:07,785
So I've given up
I've thrown in the towel

242
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,914
I've taken all the pills

243
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,545
The law will allow

244
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:20,840
And so I'm feeling blue

245
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:21,924
Sir?

246
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,220
Give me the strongest thing you've got.

247
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:34,520
- On second thought, a Black Russian.
- Very well, sir.

248
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:39,233
I guess I'm just

249
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:45,406

250
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:48,242
Frank. I thought I'd find you here.

251
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,871
Ed, sit down. Pull up a memory or two.

252
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,915
You left before I could talk to you.

253
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:00,796
Is it just my imagination
or is the whole world crazy?

254
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,467
No, it's just a small percentage
of the population, Frank.

255
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:10,931
I hope you're right. It's just that
I don't know if I fit in any more.

256
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,685
You're still thinking about Jane,
aren't you?

257
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:18,689
She's part of my life, Ed. Always will be.

258
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,026
I think about her constantly.
But it's done.

259
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,654
When she said, "Get out of my life
forever," I knew it was over.

260
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,867
Sometimes I think about you and Edna,
and I envy you,

261
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:35,664
because you've had the same person
every day for over 30 years.

262
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,293
You wake up with her,
eat with her, sleep with her...

263
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,921
You make love to the same woman.

264
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:47,385
You spend every possible
waking moment together,

265
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:52,765

just want to have fun and cheap sex.

269
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,905
I just want to love, Ed.

270
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:11,158
I'm sure you'll find love.

271
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,494
- I already have one.
- It's from the lady.

272
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:23,629
Go to her, Frank. Go on!

273
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:25,673
I'll see you in the morning.

274
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,513
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

275
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,349
Sorry.

276
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,854
This isn't easy to say.

00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,107
I'm lonely, I'm lost.
I need someone to hold, to love.

278

Frank!

279
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,194
Over here.

280
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,448
Well...

281
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,539
- What are you doing here?
- I called your hotel, got no answer.

282
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:03,711
Then I tried the station house.
I thought maybe you'd be here.

283
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,424
- Good evening, Sam.
- Mr Drebin. Jane.

284

- Didn't you get the letters?
- Every one of them.

293
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:43,083
I didn't open them. I tore them up
and threw them in the fire.

294
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:48,255
So you didn't get the cheque for $75,000
that your uncle left you in his will?

00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:53,260
I remembered something
about the crime.

297
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,096
Outside the window, I saw
a red van parked across the street.

for being here.

- I want us to be friends.
- Sure, friends...

they'd be your lover Quentin's.

1,000 acres of Brazilian rainforest.

Then I had it slashed
so we could build our dream house.

Insensitive? You think it's easy
displacing an entire tribe?

00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:09,813
Photovoltaic cells.

335
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:13,901
They convert sunlight
directly into electricity.

336
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:18,197
Fluorescents. Last 10 times as long
as a conventional light-bulb.

337
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:20,491
Uses only a quarter of the power.

338
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:25,454
Superwindows. They insulate
as well as 10 sheets of glass.

339
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,584
An electric car,
partially powered by solar panels.

340
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,504
But the truth is, gentlemen,

341
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,257
that I'm not worried about
any of these things.

342
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:41,762
Because no one is ever
going to know about them.

343
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:46,433
- What about Meinheimer and his report?
- He's going to tell the President.

344
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,104
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?

345
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:54,775
- MAN: That's kidnapping!
- Good heavens!

346
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,819
What about his speech on Tuesday?

347
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,406
Dr Meinheimer will deliver his speech.

348
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,120
It is my view that we must rely on
coal, oil and nuclear energy.

349
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,831
Our Dr Meinheimer.

350
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,418
- Oh, my God!
- MAN: That's incredible!

351
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:16,964
Meet Earl Hacker,
former arts consultant to Jesse Helms.

352
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,048
ALL: Hmm.

353
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:24,012
As I explained to Mr Hapsburg,
my fee is $1 million,

354
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:28,892
and, might I add,
I'm worth every penny of it.

355
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:32,646
But you gentlemen
don't have any choice.

356
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,317
Do you?

357
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:39,445
(LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY)

358
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:50,414
FRANK: After a good night's sleep,
I headed back to police headquarters.

359
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,459
I figured that if I buried myself
in police work,

360
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:56,587
I could forget about Jane
and maybe in the process

361
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:59,173
catch a vicious killer
before he struck again.

362
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,260
So far we had few clues
and no real leads.

363
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,221
I was hoping that the lab boys
had come up with something.

364
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:07,931
MAN: Shut it off!

365
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:09,099
And now one of you pays.

366
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,478
- Take it easy.
- Say your prayers.

367
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,855
- Nice work.
- What?

368
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:18,358
Can you show us the results
from the Research Institute?

369
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:21,487
We weren't able to get
any clean fingerprints,

370
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:24,823
but we did find footprints
outside the Institute.

371
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:28,869
We made plaster casts of them.
A size 91/2 D.

372
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:32,164
We're running a trace on it.
But more interesting,

373
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:35,209
we also found this dinosaur footprint.

374
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:39,379
- A major find from the Palaeolithic era.
- Anything else?

375
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:44,927
Yes, 20 feet down we discovered
ancient timbers from Noah's Ark.

376
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,804
About the case...

377
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:50,224
I'll be leaving for Boston tomorrow
where I'll deliver a major address

378
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,059
to the American Archaeological Society.

379
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,895
And I'm booked on Geraldo next week.

380
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,689
You're going on Geraldo
because of this?

381
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:01,276
No, my wife is a transsexual
Satan worshipper.

382
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:04,321
Meanwhile, we'll be continuing
fingerprint analysis,

383
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:07,950
fibre checks,
DNA breakdown and hair samples.

384
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:11,495
Then, using the microscopic
dirt particles on this footprint,

385
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,414
we'll get a geological breakdown
of the entire city.

386
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:17,167
We may not have that kind of time.

387
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:18,877
Then maybe this will help.

388
00:27:19,963 --> 00:27:23,715
We found this wallet
on the kerb outside the Institute.

389
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:29,012
We haven't examined it thoroughly.
It just came down from the lab.

390
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:35,102
"Hector Savage". From Detroit.
I remember this pug.

391
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:38,146
Ex-boxer.
His real name was Joey Chicago.

392
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:41,441
Oh, yeah. He fought
under the name of Kid Minneapolis.

393
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:44,778
I saw Kid Minneapolis fight once,
in Cincinnati.

394
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,364
No, that's Kid New York.
He fought out of Philly.

395
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,868
He was killed in the ring in Houston
by Tex Colorado.

396
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:53,996
- The Arizona Assassin.
- Yeah, from Dakota.

397
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:56,248
- Was it North or South?
- North.

398
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,293
South Dakota was his brother.
From West Virginia.

399
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,545
You sure know your boxing.

400
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:04,631
All I know is, never bet on the white guy.

401
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,719
- You've got an address?
- The card says, "Monique De Carlo".

402
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:11,346
"210 Bleckman Street. "

403
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:16,310
That's the red-light district. I wonder
why Savage is hanging out down there.

404
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:18,604
Sex, Frank?

405
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,734
No, not right now, Ed.
We've got work to do.

406
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:31,199
FRANK: The address we had for
De Carlo was in the city's Little Italy.

407
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:35,871
We went there, hoping it would
lead us to Hector Savage

408
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:40,125
and lead us to a clue
that would break the case wide open.

409
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,505
That's the cops.
You've got to get rid of them.

410
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:49,927
All right, I'll handle it.
Quick, hide in the basement.

411
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:51,511

- Red van.
- Yes, I know.

415
00:28:58,311 --> 00:28:59,603
Jane said that she saw a red van

416
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:02,147
outside the Institute
before the explosion.

417
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:05,817
- Oh! Let's take him down.
- No, he's not working alone.

418
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,279
- Bug the van. See where it goes.
- ED: Good thinking.

- It's very impressive, yes...

as suspicious as some people I know.

Thank you,
Mr President, for those kind words,

1014
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:25,840
but it's all part of the job.

1015
01:17:25,966 --> 01:17:30,010
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling
a special post I'm going to create.

1016
01:17:30,262 --> 01:17:33,264
It may mean long hours,
dangerous nights,

1017
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:37,601
and being surrounded by some of
the scummiest elements in our society.

1018
01:17:37,769 --> 01:17:40,729
- You want me to be in your cabinet?

1020

I want you to head up
a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.

Thank you. I'm very honoured.

1027

This is something I've always dreamt of,

You see, I've learnt something
this past week

1030
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:23,939
about the Earth and about love.

1031
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:27,776
I guess love is like the ozone layer.

Blowing away a fleeing suspect

I enjoyed it. Who wouldn't?

1035
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:46,837
But now I want to be known as
"The Environmental Police Lieutenant".
