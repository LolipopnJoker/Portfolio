Come on, honey. Get up.
We're seriously late.

I'm not kidding around

Come on now.

Oh, good.
You're already up.

28
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:12,647
You forgot to wash my shirt.

29
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:16,647
I told you 100 times, today is
purple shirt day at school.

30
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:18,632
I didn't forget.

31
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:22,288
Actually, I was up half the
night thinking about it.

32
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:23,265
Yeah, right.

33
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:28,413
And I concluded that you are too
special to look like everyone else.

34
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,125
So, orangy red.

35
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:32,522
That's your color.
Few can carry it off.

36
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,952
Now, uh... Would you help
me find your brother?

37
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,886
You lost Ben?

38
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:38,657
No.

39
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,125
I didn't lose Ben.

40
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,591
Ben?

41
00:02:46,992 --> 00:02:48,484
Ben?

42
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:51,538
All right, Ben. Fine.

43
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,015
You explain to your
teacher why you're late.

44
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,694
Your daddy said he had a very
important case this morning,

45
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:58,297
and he had to go to work early.

46
00:02:58,298 --> 00:03:02,554
And he left us here to be
responsible, that we could...

47
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,546
Shit.

48
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,757
You're so not funny.
Not funny, and you're also late,

49
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,759
and that means you have to
get dressed right now.

50
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,968
Stay. No. Stay. Ben. Ben.

51
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,460
This is not funny, Ben. We've
got to get you dressed.

52
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:21,366
We're running so late.
This is not a game. Ooh.

53
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,633
Come on.
Help me out. Ben.

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,983
Come on, Ben, really.
We're so late.

55
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:29,882
I don't want to go to school.

56
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:30,898
No.

57
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,076
Mommy!

58
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:35,011
- Mommy!
- Hi, sweetie.

59
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:39,096
Ben, you look like you're
having such a good time.

60
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:41,311
- But we're running a little late.
- Ben.

61
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,217
Sweetie, I thought you were supposed
to be wearing purple today.

62
00:03:43,218 --> 00:03:45,295
- She forgot to wash it.
- Oh, hey.

63
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,402
Mmm, what a hug.

64
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:56,196
I'll handle it
from here, Isabel.

65
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:59,053
I'm sure you will, Jackie.

66
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:10,074
Oh, my gosh.
She made you a lunch?

67
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,108

JACKIE: Because I like
it, and I'm driving.

71

And when you get your own
car, you can pick the music.

72
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:42,092
Why does Isabel
wear Daddy's underpants?

73
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,405
Doesn't she have
underpants of her own?

74
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:48,420
Uh, well, I saw a whopping pile of
laundry sitting on the washing machine.

75
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,354
Perhaps Isabel's
underpants are in there.

76
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,523
They're right next
to my purple shirt.

77
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,186
I'm never speaking
to her again.

78
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,554
Never say never.
Here's your vitamins.

79
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,467
She's always
messing up my life.

80
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,601
It's not fair to say always.

81
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:02,170
I hate her.
She's such a witch.

82
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,738
Hey. No name-calling.
Use your words.

83
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,398
I hate when you say that.

84
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,727
Now that's a beginning.

85
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,764
Hate is a totally
acceptable word.

86
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,398
You just have to be careful
when you use it.

87
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,272
And only use it when you
truly detest something.

88
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,382
BEN: Like what?

89
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,420
Well, like... The planet Uranus.

90
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,351
I hate that. It's a
terrible name for a planet.

91
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,842
Your anus.

92
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,640

- The hokey-pokey?

White pants, black top, and if it's the
black top, is it the white or black bra?

Oh, I trust you.

I just don't understand why you're
shooting the craft service guy

when I've got five male models in
very expensive suits over here.

Thank you, ladies. That's lovely.
It's a wrap, everybody.

No! No, no.
It's not a wrap.

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,543
Not a wrap.
She's kidding.

133
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,695
You're kidding,
aren't you, Isabel?

134
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:06,399
I'm not kidding, actually. And if
you meet me back here in an hour,

even though I wouldn't
sleep with you.

137

She's got such
a great sense of humor.

00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:32,016
Let's see if I can save

139
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,050
both our jobs.

140
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,664
Wow.

Congratulations, Duncan.

MAN 2: Well, the suit
takes pounds off him.

147
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,962
While change is
exhilarating for an adult,

148
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:04,703
it can be quite
a challenge for a child.

149
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,462
I won't get that.

150
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:12,002
That's fine.

151
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:15,229
Change. You were
talking about change.

152
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,400
Well, the fact that
you two are remarrying

153
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:22,016
obviously has Anna overjoyed, and she's
very excited about the move to Switzerland.

154
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:24,251
She said we are remarrying?

155
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:25,127
Mmm-hmm.

156
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:28,790
And my concern is that Anna seems
apathetic towards her work,

157
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,174
knowing she's leaving
before the semester.

158
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:34,290
- Mrs. Franklin, we are not...
- No plans on getting...

159
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,065
- Remarried. There's no move...
- To Switzerland.

160
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,946
- No.
- Really?

161
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,213
Really.

162
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:44,190
Well, then my concern for Anna,

163
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,158
is that she...

164
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,142
- Are you here?
- I'm here.

165
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,502
Because you don't seem
like you're really here.

166
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:51,548
I'm here.

167
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:54,025
The judge is about to rule on a motion
that could make or break this case

168
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:56,556
I've been working on for eight months,
but have I answered my beeper?

169
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:59,649
So turn it off.

170
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,806
I'm wondering if there's
anything going on at home

171
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,743
that could possibly be intensifying
Anna's need to create this fantasy.

172
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,546
I've been seeing another
woman for the past year.

173
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,496
In the three short years since our divorce,
he's seen a number of women, and...

174
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:14,848
I saw a few women when we first split up, but
I've been seeing one woman for the past year.

175
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:18,542
- Without very much warning to the kids...
- After discussion with her and the kids, I might add,

176
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,933
- she moved in last month.
- He's living with a woman half his age.

177
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,933
- Isabel's not half my age.
- We're not discussing your age.

178
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,073
Then why bring it up?

179
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:26,041
When they go to your house,
they want to be with you.

180
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,840
They want to be
with their father.

181
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,784
When they come to my house, they
want to be part of my life.

182
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,448
Isabel's part of my life.

183
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:35,011
Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking
about your life, your needs,

184
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:39,237
but are you really in touch
with what Anna needs?

185
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:42,449
Anna needs a home where
she feels safe and loved.

186
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,761
- What I'm trying to give her.
- I thought that's what she already had.

187
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:47,331
I would walk through
fire for Anna.

188
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:48,613
Gladly.

189
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,120
Any day of the week.

190
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,284
Except Thursday, when Isabel
forgot to pick them up.

191
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:54,808
Jackie, she was five minutes
late, for Christ's sakes.

192
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,370
- Well...
- She was five minutes late.

193
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:01,238
I'm wondering if Anna could be
responding to the underlying hostility

194
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:04,940
that exist between your
girlfriend and Mrs. Harrison.

195
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:07,775
Well, of course
she's responding to it.

196
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:11,151
Mrs. Franklin, do you think
any of this is easy for us?

197
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,206
Do you think it's easy for
Jackie to watch her kids

198
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,417
being looked after
by another woman?

199
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:20,387
Not to mention a woman who really
has no experience being a mother.

200
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:22,175
Of course, Jackie's going to be

201
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,784
irrational, hostile,

202
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:26,318
defensive.

203
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:29,981
Thank you, Luke.

204
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:37,823
I didn't say that. Why would I say that
you and Daddy are getting back together?

205
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:41,926
Sometimes people make up stories about
things that they wish would happen.

206
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,347
I don't want that to happen.
Why would I want that to happen?

207
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:46,714
Okay, pick a card, any card.

208
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,691
Because you're upset?

209
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,933
You know, because
Isabel moved in, and...

210
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:54,315
I'm not upset. I'm not gonna
get myself upset over her.

211
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,253
Okay, tear it in half.

212
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:59,503
- Look, sweetie, if it means that...
- Again.

213
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,543
- If you really...
- Again.

214
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:03,886
- If you want...
- And again.

215
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:06,402
Time out.

216
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:09,737
If you don't want to talk about
this now, it's okay, really.

217
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:11,892
You don't have to.

218
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:14,618
But don't look me in
the eye and lie to me.

219
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:17,431
It hurts my feelings,
I get angry, and...

220
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:20,704
Anyway, you're only allowed so many lies
before it starts showing in your face,

221
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,861
and you wind up looking like...

222
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:24,783
Like who?

223
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:28,580
Well, he's not president
anymore, so why be petty?

224
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,492
I'm sorry I said it. I...

225
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,564
I guess sometimes I just...

226
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:40,048
You know, sometimes I do
wish you and Daddy would...

227
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,883
- Well, you know.
- Yeah.

228
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:47,791
I figured if I said it out
loud, it just might come true.

229
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:50,364
Yeah, I know.

230
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:11,259
ISABEL: It's not that I can't cook,
it's that I choose not to cook.

231
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,626
There's a big difference.

232
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:14,562
Well, you don't have to cook.

233
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:18,232
Could we... Save some
of the wine, will you?

234
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:22,556
- I need it for the sauce.
- It's too late.

235
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:24,358
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,881
Mmm-mmm.

237
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:33,086
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

238
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,353
- You better get it.
- Okay.

239
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,111
Hello?

240
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,056
<i>Hello?</i>

241
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:44,818
Who was there?

242
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,032
Nobody there.

243
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,851
- I missed you today. Yeah,
- I missed you, too.

244
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:56,570
- I miss you every day.
- How was your day, baby?

245
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:59,092
It was pretty good, except I
gotta go back to Pittsburgh.

246
00:12:59,093 --> 00:12:59,742
No.

247
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:02,686
Yeah, I gotta go
tomorrow till Sunday.

248
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,563
Oh, but I'll have to order in.

249
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,343
Well, we got the kids
for the weekend,

250
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:12,398
so I figured that you
and the kids and me

251
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,459
could all go to Pittsburgh.

252
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,217
Yay!
Never gonna happen.

253
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:21,928
No? Come on, we could
get a great hotel room.

254
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,864
We could go take in a
baseball game or something.

255
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:27,599
- What do you think?
- Pass. No, no, no.

256
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,028
All right. Well, then I'll
call the baby-sitter.

257
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:32,520
What for?

258
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,849
I don't expect you
to handle them yourself.

259
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,575
- Hmm.
- What?

260
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:45,974
Can't handle them myself.
That's what you mean, isn't it?

261
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,482
No.

262
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,021
Hello?

263
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
You don't trust me to be
alone with your kids.

264
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:08,959
Yes, I do.

265
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,669
- No.
- Of course I do. It's just that...

266
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,325
- What?
- Well, that they're a handful.

267
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:17,887
Luke, by keeping me apart from
them, it's like you're saying,

268
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:20,193
"Hey, kids, this is fun.
Keep on hating her."

269
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,872
Oh, come on, don't say that.
They don't hate you.

270
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,302
Really?

271
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:25,195
Look in their eyes, honey.

272
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,098
Look in your ex-wife's eyes.

273
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,442
Jackie's just trying
to protect the kids.

274
00:14:29,443 --> 00:14:31,701
What do you expect?
It's hard for her.

275
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:35,145
And it's complicated. You don't
understand. You don't have kids.

276
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,926
Okay, um, so,

277
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,255
it's just complicated
for you and Jackie.

278
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:46,038
For me, it's pretty simple,
because I don't have kids.

279
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,405
Look, I'm trying to
make things work here,

280
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,679
trying to give you guys some time
to get used to living together.

281
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,383
All right, then.
Back off just a little bit.

282
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:57,186
And give me a chance, okay?

283
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:05,671
Hello.

284
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:08,249
<i>Hello.</i>

285
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:11,311
What is your problem, asshole?

286
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:13,507
You are my problem.

287
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,475
<i></i>

288
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,577
You're absolutely right, baby.

289
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:23,874
Your kids don't hate me.
I'm just...

290
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,452
I'm just paranoid.
Call your daughter.

291
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,022
I trust you.

292
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:34,233
Really?

293
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,538
I'll give you a chance,
if you still want it.

294
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:40,046
- I do.
- You sure?

295
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,547
Yes.

296
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,822
Okay.

297
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,898
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

298
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,827
Don't fight
with me when I'm hungry.

299
00:15:55,257 --> 00:15:57,546
ANNA: So, how long are you
going to be out of town?

300
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,077
LUKE:
Sunday morning.

301
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:00,733
Well, I'm worried.

302
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:01,533
About what?

303
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,124
About being alone
with her all weekend.

304
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,702
I mean, what if she
burns the place down?

305
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:08,819
Well, just keep an eye on her and

306
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,827
make sure you've always got
the fire extinguisher handy.

307
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,008
- You ready to launch her?
- Yeah.

308
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:17,930
- Okay. Give her a good push.
- Give her a good push.

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,035
So, why did she move
in with you, anyways?

310
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:25,958
Because we love each other and...

311
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,418
because we want to
share our lives together.

312
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,254
Well, you already had
a life with Mommy.

313
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:34,348
But Mommy and I weren't
getting along very well,

314
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:38,497
and it wasn't fair to you guys,
us fighting all the time.

315
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,169
I fight with Anna all the time.

316
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,051
Can I move out?

317
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:46,220
No. But you guys
are brother and sister.

318
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:50,469
Well, you were husband and wife.
Doesn't that mean something?

319
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,678
Yes. It does.

320
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:58,604
But... Well,

321
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:02,208
when you get older,

322
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,791
your relationships get
a lot more complicated.

323
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:10,620
And there are all kinds
of feelings flying around.

324
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,643
And sometimes,

325
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,678
some of those feelings change.

326
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,151
But did you fall out
of love with Mommy?

327
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,682
Well,

328
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,366
yeah.

329
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,268
I guess I did.

330
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,004
I still love your mom.

331
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:44,260
It just became a
different kind of love.

332
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,268
That's all.

333
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:50,362
We're still really good
friends, and we always will be.

334
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:54,511
Can you ever fall out
of love with your kids?

335
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,945
No.

336
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,816
That is impossible.

337
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,386
- Like <i>Mission: Impossible?</i>
- Yeah. Exactly like <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>.

338
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,908
Powdered lizard brains.

339
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:18,942
Crushed werewolf ears.

340
00:18:19,293 --> 00:18:21,394
And vampire eyes.

341
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:26,707
Whoa!

342
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:30,085
God.

343
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,605
Cool.

344
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:53,068
Check it out.
Magic potion.

345
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,894
It's cocoa.

346
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:59,863
I put a spell on it. Whoever drinks
it will go to sleep for 1000 years.

347
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:01,582
Whatever. If you spill
any on my drawing,

348
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,615
I will put you to sleep
for 1000 years.

349
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:05,921
Hey, you guys.

350
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:09,240
I have a surprise for you.
Come over to the sofa.

351
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,523
Please?

352
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:15,326
With a little enthusiasm.

353
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,760
Sit down.

354
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:20,889
All right, and close your eyes.

355
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,468
Please.

356
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:23,892
Okay.

357
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:30,647
Okay, now. Don't open them
till I tell you to, okay?

358
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,002
And open.

359
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:35,729
- Wow!
- What do you think?

360
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,924
Will he eat my bunny?

361
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,060
No. Puppies
don't eat bunnies.

362
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,240
Anna, what do you think?

363
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,823
Well, I'm allergic to dogs.

364
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,908
Uh, your daddy
didn't tell me that.

365
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:52,010
Well, he doesn't know much about me.
He's never around.

366
00:19:54,144 --> 00:19:57,627
Why don't we name the puppy?
Puppy needs a name.

367
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,395
I know. Isabel.

368
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:01,807
I beg your pardon?

369
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,464
Well, he kind of
smells like you,

370
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:06,604
and I'm allergic to you, too.
Fits perfectly.

371
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,440
Ben, why don't you name that
puppy, and I'll be right back?

372
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,575
<i></i>

373
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,799
Listen, young lady,
let's get one thing straight.

374
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,870
Don't touch my things.

375
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:29,299
Look, I would really like
it if we could get along.

376
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,454
- I don't have to listen to you.
- Yes, you do.

377
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,196
No, I don't.
You're not my mother.

378
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:35,664
Thank God for that.

379
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:48,329
What I meant, and perhaps
I didn't say it well,

380
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,680
is that you have a great mom,
you don't need another one.

381
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:55,149
But I would like to be
treated with some respect

382
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,593
when you are in this house.

383
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:58,835
Well, this is my dad's house.

384
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:01,764
Well, this is my house, too.

385
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:06,085
Well, this is my room, so treat
it with some respect and get out.

386
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:12,041
All right.

387
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,311
"Run, run, run,
as fast as you can.

388
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:34,889
"You can't catch me.
I'm the stinky cheese man."

389
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,039
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?
I made it specially for you.

390
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,749
Yes, of course.

391
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,684
Special cocoa.

392
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,054
Delicious.

393
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:59,164
"A little boy looked up
and sniffed the air,

394
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:01,194
- "and said..."
- No, now you're cheating.

395
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,413
You skipped the part
about the cow.

396
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,913
Mmm.

397
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:09,444
It's bedtime. Can we finish
this in the morning?

398
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:11,764
No. Now we have to start
from the beginning,

399
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,952
and you have to
read the whole thing.

400
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:16,561
I can't sleep otherwise.

401
00:22:16,562 --> 00:22:18,929
Okay.

402
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:23,241
"Once upon a time, there
was a little old woman

403
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,764
"and a little old man..."

404
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:28,899
"Who lived together
in a little old house."

405
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,265
Hey, you are
on to something there.

406
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,211
Why don't you
read to me a little bit?

407
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:36,523
"They were lonely,
so the little old lady

408
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:42,094
"decided to make a man
out of stinky cheese.

409
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,757
"She gave him a piece
of bacon for a mouth

410
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:47,692
"and two olives
for eyes..."

411
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:52,990
Isabel?
Isabel?

412
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:54,559
Isabel?

413
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:04,833
Food poisoning. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

414
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:08,884
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

415
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,055
Oh, my God.

416
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,921
What's the matter?

417
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:21,289
I killed her.

418
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,867
<i>♪ Killed her, killed her ♪</i>

419
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:27,967
<i>♪ Killed her ♪</i>

420
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,047
- Good morning.
- It is 7:23.

421
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,156
You were supposed
to be here at 6:30.

422
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:06,632
She has missed her
morning riding lesson.

423
00:24:06,633 --> 00:24:09,235
No, it's Monday. Her riding
lesson is on Tuesday.

424
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:13,546
Except for the third Tuesday of the
month, which switches to Monday,

425
00:24:13,547 --> 00:24:16,577
and in November, when
she rides on Thursdays.

426
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,367
I mean, it is not
that difficult.

427
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:22,773
Don't you have some little black agenda
book that you can write all this down in?

428
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:25,898
May I have a cup
of coffee, please?

429
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,140
We don't have coffee.

430
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:30,265
Good morning, Betty Ford.

431
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:33,390
Hey, monkey-man.
Hi, sweetie. How are you do...

432
00:24:33,391 --> 00:24:34,723
Anna?

433
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,959
Anna?

434
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:41,464
Sweetie, go change your shirt.

435
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,429
What happened to Anna?
What did you do?

436
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,827
Maybe you could just
back off me a little bit.

437
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:47,728
What happened?

438
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:50,224
Nothing happened.
I...

439
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,906
Luke was in the shower
this morning, and...

440
00:24:54,907 --> 00:25:00,312
Anna sort of walked in
without even knocking.

441
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:02,742
Well, I don't see why
that would upset her.

442
00:25:02,743 --> 00:25:08,163
I mean, there have been people in our
family that have taken showers before.

443
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:11,265
Well, I was in there with him.

444
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,593
And did either of you

445
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:21,288
talk to her
about it afterwards?

446
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,640
No. I thought it would be
uncomfortable for her.

447
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,672
You mean for you.

448
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:32,577
A 12-year-old girl is trying
to cope with the fact

449
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:36,914
that her father is never moving
back in here with his family.

450
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:42,031
She sees her father naked in the shower
with another woman for the first time,

451
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:45,101
and you think it would be
better for her

452
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:47,234
if everyone just pretends
nothing happened?

453
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:51,273
I am so unbelievably sick
of your imperious bullshit.

454
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:53,187
I never said I was
June fucking Cleaver...

455
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:55,093
Look, you don't use that kind
of language in this house.

456
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:56,227
And if every time
life hits her hard,

457
00:25:56,229 --> 00:26:00,931
you want to have some 12-hour conversation
every third Tuesday of the month,

458
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:03,570
you go right ahead, lady.
I have a life.

459
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:07,695
Oh, and I don't?
Because I have children?

460
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:13,796
You know what your problem is?
You are so self-involved.

461
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:16,431
You couldn't be a mother.

462
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:18,921
Maybe the problem
here is your daughter.

463
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:21,734
And that she is a spoiled,
wise-ass little brat.

464
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:23,610
Get out of my house.

465
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,749
Get out.

466
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,711
Are you sure? I didn't see
that on the schedule.

467
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:41,246
Honey, I've got your
Halloween costume.

468
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:44,570
Let's see if it's
the right size, okay?

469
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:46,766
A hippie?

470
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:49,046
Didn't you say you
wanted to be a hippie?

471
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:51,179
That was last month.

472
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,499
Oh, well, okay. What do you
want to be this month?

473
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,413
Elvis.

474
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,368
Elvis?
What kind of Elvis?

475
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,869
You mean, like black
leather jacket Elvis?

476
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,266
Gold lame Elvis.

477
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:07,773
Gold lame Elvis. Like, that's
pre-drugs, pre-chubby, pre-army,

478
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:10,226
- pre-bad-movie, all of that Elvis?
- Yeah.

479
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:12,260
Oh, honey, um...

480
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:14,991
Uh...

481
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:20,918
When Daddy was washing
Isabel in the shower,

482
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,739
what did you think
that was about?

483
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:26,545
Well, sex, of course.

484
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:29,476
Oh.

485
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:30,737
Okay.

486
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:35,054
Why does Isabel scream?

487
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:37,475
- Scream?
- During sex.

488
00:27:37,804 --> 00:27:39,640
How do you know
she screams during sex?

489
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,772
I live in the same country.

490
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:45,327
Um...

491
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:50,681
- Why are you asking me?
- Just checking.

492
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:52,788
I like to talk
to you about stuff.

493
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:55,998
I like talking to you
about stuff, too.

494
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:58,186
So, since Daddy's
gonna be working,

495
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:01,787
do you want to do something
on Saturday, just you and me?

496
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:03,897
Sure, but it's gonna have
to be in the evening,

497
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:07,944
'cause I'm helping Bonnie Lyons
move into her apartment and...

498
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:13,101
So you're gonna be with Isabel.

499
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:14,422
Again?

500
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:16,194
That really sucks.

501
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:20,374
Well, you're gonna be at a professional
photo shoot in Central Park.

502
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,476
You guys are gonna
have a lot of fun.

503
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:27,460
ISABEL: Switch your hands. Put your top
hand down and your bottom hand up.

504
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:31,835
Dylan, can you take just one step up
for me, please? Just one big step.

505
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:35,046
Rapunzel, if you could reach
your hand out like that again?

506
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,452
Wouldn't it be cool if her
hair came out of her armpits?

507
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:40,624
Oh, sick.

508
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,148
I think we can get this
finished before lunch.

509
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,546
All right, folks,
we like this light.

510
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:47,460
We're gonna try and get
this in before lunch.

511
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,202
Well, come on, it's been five hours.
We're hungry.

512
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:52,476
Yeah, we're starving.

513
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:55,288
Um, get yourself another
ice cream, okay?

514
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,719
And I'll be done soon.

515
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,057
I promise.

516
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:01,946
We're rich.

517
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:14,281
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

518
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:16,250
Where's your brother?

519
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,351
I don't know.

520
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:24,404
Ben?

521
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:26,968
Ben?

522
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:27,922
What if he's kidnapped?

523
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:30,405
He's not kidnapped.
He's just... He's hiding.

524
00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:31,655
Ben!

525
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:32,999
Maybe he's in the castle.

526
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,736
- That's a good idea.
- Don't touch me, you bring bad luck.

527
00:29:40,352 --> 00:29:42,101
Ben!

528
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:43,935
Ben?

529
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,444
Ben!

530
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:01,480
Ben!

531
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,017
Ben!

532
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:10,023
Okay, watch very carefully.

533
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,222
Come on, come on, come on.

534
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:24,671
All right.

535
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:30,726
Ben? Ben.

536
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:32,874
- Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

537
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,176
Oh, baby.

538
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:38,490
- Are you all right?
- I knew where I was all the time.

539
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:40,523
- I'm sure you did.
- We found him in the zoo.

540
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:42,859
In the zoo.
My God.

541
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,944
Hold his hand, don't let
him out of your sight.

542
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,319
Jackie, I am so sorry...

543
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,001
I'm gonna say this one
time, so listen carefully.

544
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:55,360
That woman is to have nothing
more to do with my children.

545
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:56,704
Our children.

546
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:59,346
Do you realize what could
have happened to your son?

547
00:30:59,347 --> 00:31:03,079
How lucky we are that the police
found him instead of some lunatic?

548
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,618
I mean, they could... Jackie, you
don't have to make it any worse.

549
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:08,306
Isabel is sorry. She feels terrible.
It could have happened to anyone.

550
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:09,158
Not to me.

551
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:11,290
You've made mistakes.
People make mistakes.

552
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,457
Well, I am not gonna sit here
and wait for the next one.

553
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,556
I'm not gonna watch our children fall
through the cracks of this arrangement.

554
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:18,447
- Just calm down...
- No, I'm not gonna calm down.

555
00:31:18,448 --> 00:31:19,673
I'm going to a lawyer.

556
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:21,574
Don't do that. We promised
we'd never do that.

557
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,274
Well, we've broken a lot of
promises, haven't we, Luke?

558
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:26,017
Don't take this out on him.

559
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,314
- It's my fault.
- Isabel, why don't you just...

560
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:29,515
Honey, I'm so sorry.

561
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,306
But you're not making this
any easier on anybody.

562
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:35,900
It is not my job to
make it easier for you.

563
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:41,118
It is my job to take care of those children,
and they don't want to be with you.

564
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,806
I'm getting a court order,

565
00:31:42,807 --> 00:31:46,431
and you are never going to be
with these children again, alone.

566
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,832
Do you understand?
Ever.

567
00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:08,111
- Mommy?
- What, sweetie?

568
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:10,681
It's not Isabel's fault that I ran away.

569
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:12,611
No, you're right.
That was your fault.

570
00:32:12,612 --> 00:32:16,916
But it's her fault for not taking care of
my precious son as if it was her priority.

571
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:19,713
Which means her
most important job.

572
00:32:19,714 --> 00:32:22,455
Isabel's job is she works.

573
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,548
Ben, mommies work, too.
They work very hard.

574
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,908
In fact, I work harder as a mommy than
I ever did when I had an outside job.

575
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,603
I just don't get paid.

576
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:32,056
Does Isabel make
a lot of money?

577
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:33,089
Well, people like Isabel,

578
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:37,961
who think only about themselves,
often do make a great deal of money.

579
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:40,439
I think she's pretty.

580
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,689
Yeah. If you like big teeth.

581
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:47,733
- Mommy?
- What, sweetie?

582
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:51,297
If you want me
to hate her, I will.

583
00:33:17,815 --> 00:33:19,127
What do you want?

584
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:21,062
Anna left her soccer
stuff at the loft.

585
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,634
Figured she might
need it this week.

586
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,034
Thanks.

587
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:30,947
Did you talk to the lawyer?

588
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:34,815
Yep. I have an appointment
for the day after tomorrow.

589
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:37,432
Don't do this.

590
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,767
You're going to tell me not to put
the kids in the middle of a war.

591
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,353
Luke, I'm doing this
for their own well-being.

592
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,908
Partly.

593
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:47,977
And partly you're doing it
because you're mad.

594
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:50,634
You know the kids aren't
in any real danger.

595
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:52,682
This is about Isabel,
and you know it.

596
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,851
She made one mistake,
but she's trying. She's learning.

597
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:59,736
Oh. Slugs have a faster
learning curve, okay?

598
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,994
Trees. Clams.

599
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:05,260
Give her some time, will you?
Don't drive her away.

600
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,338
I'm supposed to care about her?

601
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,939
You're supposed to care about
me, like I care about you.

602
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,173
Like you cared about me three
years ago, when you walked out?

603
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:16,799
- You kicked me out!
- You were gone long before I asked you.

604
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,122
- Don't give me this shit. I was working, for God's sake!
- I didn't have any choice...

605
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:25,298
I'm sorry. Look,
let's wait a second.

606
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,485
Don't...

607
00:34:27,486 --> 00:34:31,337
Please don't do this thing
with the lawyers.

608
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:35,207
The kids'll be okay
if we're okay.

609
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,312
I'd do it for you.

610
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,589
Okay, I'm gonna give
you one last chance.

611
00:34:58,353 --> 00:34:59,920
Thanks.

612
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,205
Thanks.

613
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,345
Good night.

614
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:22,293
<i></i>

615
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:31,933
This is incredible.

616
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:34,702
This is the one that I like the best.
She's got a really long...

617
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:37,462
- She's great in that.
- He couldn't be more flexed.

618
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:40,130
- Yeah, very studly.
- C-14.

619
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:42,212
Excuse me.

620
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:44,446
You know, the way he's leaning
back, and he's more...

621
00:35:44,448 --> 00:35:46,118
Bill. Bill!
Kill that music, please.

622
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,290
No. No, but that looks passive.

623
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,993
This is dynamic. He's going
up, he's gonna get that girl.

624
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:53,196
You're the photographer.
You're the genius.

625
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:54,863
Isabel, it's Anna's school.

626
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:57,407
They're looking for Luke.

627
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:02,967
- Hello.
- <i>Yeah, I'm looking for Luke Harrison.</i>

628
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:04,154
No, he's not here.
This is...

629
00:36:04,155 --> 00:36:06,967
<i>The children are here waiting for
their mother to pick them up.</i>

630
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:08,796
Well, are you sure
you have the right kids?

631
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:11,154
<i>Yeah, Anna and
Ben Harrison. Why?</i>

632
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:14,823
Because Jackie Harrison would
never forget to pick up her kids.

633
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:16,920
<i>I'm sure that's true,
but they're still waiting.</i>

634
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,287
Are you absolutely
sure it's them?

635
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,223
<i>Positive, lady. No
one's picked them up.</i>

636
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:21,779
Okay. <i>We're locking
up in 30 minutes.</i>

637
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,217
Of course.
I'll be right there.

638
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:25,569
<i>Okay.</i> I will pick them up.
Thank you.

639
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:27,560
What?

640
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,202
Isabel, may I remind you that the
clients are gonna be here at 4:30?

641
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:31,873
- I know, so I have to hurry.
- Is everything okay?

642
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:33,779
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't worry. I'll be back,

643
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,826
and I will dazzle you
with my punctuality.

644
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,224
Mmm.
To the button.

645
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:40,059
Isabel, don't do this.

646
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,036
Hi, guys.

647
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,918
- Barbecue. I know they're your fave.
- Wait.

648
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:08,544
How could she just
forget us? I mean...

649
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:12,672
Yeah. That's something
you would do.

650
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:17,120
To tell you the truth,

651
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:21,155
I did.

652
00:37:23,452 --> 00:37:27,787
Your mother had to help a
friend with this emergency,

653
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:30,607
and so she called me
to switch days.

654
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:34,826
But I got caught up at work and
just forgot all about you.

655
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:35,990
BOTH:
Mommy!

656
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:38,024
My little chick.

657
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,650
How are you, sweetie?
I'm sorry you got stuck.

658
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:43,611
Were you scared?

659
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,837
- You must be starving.
- Yeah.

660
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:48,477
Yeah? You hungry?

661
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:50,063
- You want a good meal?
- Yeah. Yes.

662
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:52,064
How'd you do on your math?

663
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,438
Who is it?

664
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:13,392
JACKIE: It's Jackie.
May I come in?

665
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,087
Sure.

666
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,946
I have another appointment
this afternoon, and I...

667
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:32,333
I need somebody to take
the children to the park.

668
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:37,091
And have federal agents jump out of the
bushes and serve me with a court order?

669
00:38:37,092 --> 00:38:40,153
How many years do you get in this state
for giving second-rate care to minors?

670
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,403
Whatever it is,
it's not enough.

671
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,692
Well, look, I'm on thin ice
already with my boss, all right?

672
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:47,526
Fine. When I ran out
of here yesterday,

673
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:49,255
I actually thought
he was gonna fire me.

674
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:50,591
I can get somebody else.

675
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:53,818
Wait. God.

676
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:59,012
I'll figure something out.
I'll do it.

677
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:06,661
After-school snack.
Refrigerate if possible.

678
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:10,544
Band-Aids, Neosporin, hand
wipes, Kleenex, Tylenol.

679
00:39:10,545 --> 00:39:13,345
Why not just bring
the whole pharmacy?

680
00:39:13,982 --> 00:39:15,856
Ben likes to be read to.
You know <i>Dr. Seuss</i>?

681
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,591
Not personally.

682
00:39:18,576 --> 00:39:21,879
Do you have a word limit that
you have to hit every day,

683
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,181
or may I finish?

684
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,549
Here's the kids' schedule, my beeper
number, in case of emergency.

685
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,064
If not, I'll see you
at 5:00 at the park.

686
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:35,775
All I'm asking is that my children
still be alive when I get there.

687
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:39,893
Jackie, I wanted to
ask you something, uh...

688
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:43,634
There's a Pearl Jam
concert on the 5th,

689
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:46,135
and I would like to take Anna.

690
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:49,424
Is that a weekday?

691
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:52,822
I think it's a Thursday.

692
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:58,166
You want to take a 12-year-old girl to
a Pearl Jam concert on a school night?

693
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,493
I just thought it would be something
nice that she and I could do together.

694
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:08,283
It's ridiculous.
She's too young.

695
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,752
It's spread?

696
00:40:44,753 --> 00:40:46,587
But I did...

697
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:50,274
I did everything right.
Everything I was supposed to do.

698
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:55,493
DOCTOR: We found some cells in your
lymph nodes, in three of them.

699
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,510
But you said the last
time that you got it all.

700
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:02,509
So if you were wrong the last time, there's
a good chance you're wrong this time,

701
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:06,196
- because the last time you...
- The last time was a year ago.

702
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:10,188
We found a tiny lump, we treated it.
We thought we got it all.

703
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:14,325
We were hopeful, but there
were no guarantees.

704
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:18,852
But people... You...
We can beat it.

705
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:21,813
I mean, you can...
People beat it all the time, right?

706
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:23,188
Every day, more and more.

707
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,844
Okay.
So, what's the plan?

708
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:28,220
What do we do? Another
round of radiation?

709
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,832
Chemotherapy.

710
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:35,037
That's necessary?

711
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,293
Let's give it our best shot.

712
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:45,092
Right. Okay. Excuse me,
I gotta get the kids.

713
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:47,459
We'll discuss this
at your next appointment.

714
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,695
And you should share this with
your kids and your ex-husband.

715
00:41:50,697 --> 00:41:53,686
How would his worry or my kids'
worry make any difference?

716
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:55,820
Sooner than later.

717
00:41:56,689 --> 00:41:58,322
You need to.

718
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,530
Jackie?

719
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,465
Okay. Okay.
Think about it.

720
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:20,453
Hi.

721
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,781
I see her.

722
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,189
Hi.

723
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,937
- How are you?
- Hi.

724
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:31,405
Thanks for coming.

725
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:32,835
You're welcome.

726
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:34,366
You look pretty.

727
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,867
Thanks.

728
00:42:37,977 --> 00:42:39,093
Listen...

729
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:42,414
I'm glad you called, 'cause there's
something I want to tell you, too.

730
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:44,437
Oh. Okay.
Well, you go first.

731
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:47,406
Well, let me have a drink here.

732
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:58,803
I'm going to ask
Isabel to marry me.

733
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,647
- Wow.
- Yeah.

734
00:43:05,648 --> 00:43:09,036
I know you don't think
much of her... Oh...

735
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:11,271
She's a special person. Uh-huh.

736
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,704
She really is, Jackie.

737
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:18,310
And now... Why are
you telling me this?

738
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:20,123
I want you to tell me
that it's okay.

739
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:21,396
You don't need my approval.

740
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:22,474
The kids do.

741
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,405
- WAITER: Good evening.
- Ah.

742
00:43:24,406 --> 00:43:25,833
Would you and your wife
care to look at the menu?

743
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:27,662
- I'm not his wife.
- Oh.

744
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:29,830
No, thank you.

745
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:31,933
Give me a drink,
though, please?

746
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:34,969
This... This...
Whatever this is.

747
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:39,242
I think it's gonna be
hard for the kids.

748
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:42,944
And I... I was hoping we
could tell them together.

749
00:43:42,946 --> 00:43:45,997
And that'd make it easier for the kids?
Or for you?

750
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,529
Because, you know, you can't
just decide to be a "we,"

751
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,419
an "us," whenever
it's convenient for you.

752
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,669
- We... No, we are over.
- We are over.

753
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,537
We are still their parents
for the next 100 years.

754
00:44:12,506 --> 00:44:14,940
Why?

755
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:20,357
Just tell me why
you think this marriage

756
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,826
is gonna work, and ours didn't.

757
00:44:42,772 --> 00:44:44,474
Um, what did you want
to talk to me about?

758
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,675
Nothing. It's, um...

759
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,888
I think we have
quite enough to deal with

760
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,322
just with your news.

761
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,121
Mmm.

762
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:17,716
- Good morning.
- Good morning, baby.

763
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:21,106
I got something for you.

764
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:23,109
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

765
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:29,134
Mmm. But you have to
wake up to get it.

766
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:31,473
Oh, okay.

767
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,272
- Hi.
- Hi.

768
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:45,706
I'm awake.

769
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:08,888
Hmm.

770
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:10,739
Uh...

771
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,707
You shouldn't have?

772
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:17,004
The first time I got married,

773
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:19,939
we'd been together
since college.

774
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:24,877
And marriage just seemed
like the next step.

775
00:46:25,746 --> 00:46:29,015
It was just something
that happened.

776
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:33,704
But I think for two people
to really love each other,

777
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:37,852
to really commit to each other,

778
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:39,953
it has to be...

779
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:44,413
It has to be an act of will.

780
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:47,024
Or a decision.

781
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:50,391
And I think two people
have to live that decision

782
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,704
every day,

783
00:46:52,705 --> 00:46:56,766
even when things are hard
and you feel like giving up.

784
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,133
You have to

785
00:46:59,134 --> 00:47:01,868
hang on to that decision,

786
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:08,908
that choice to love each other,

787
00:47:09,408 --> 00:47:12,510
even if it's only by a thread.

788
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:15,514
I...

789
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:19,082
Let that thread break once.

790
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,934
This time it won't.

791
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,551
Will you marry me?

792
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:37,420
Yes. Yes, I will.

793
00:47:48,502 --> 00:47:49,954
JACKIE: Sweetheart,
don't get upset.

794
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:52,806
I'm not upset.
Why would I be upset?

795
00:47:52,807 --> 00:47:55,923
I mean, no one asked me
when you got a divorce.

796
00:47:55,924 --> 00:47:58,158
No one asked me if I
wanted a new mother.

797
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,883
No one even asked me
if I liked her.

798
00:48:00,884 --> 00:48:04,273
If you guys don't care about keeping our
family together, then why should I?

799
00:48:04,274 --> 00:48:07,913
Anna, Daddy and I tried
very hard, really we did.

800
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:10,976
No, you didn't. All you did was
name-call. I heard you.

801
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:14,141
You didn't even try
to use your words.

802
00:48:14,868 --> 00:48:16,226
Okay, buddy.

803
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:20,211
Baby, Isabel's not gonna
take my place as your mom.

804
00:48:20,212 --> 00:48:21,640
LUKE: No.

805
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:24,890
It's just that Isabel's
gonna be in your life,

806
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:28,836
and hopefully you can
learn to accept her.

807
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:30,704
Hmm?

808
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:36,243
Oh, sweetheart.

809
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,847
Oh, honey.

810
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:44,384
You know,
life is full of hard things.

811
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:47,121
And sometimes
it isn't fair, and...

812
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,396
But, you know,
you have a choice.

813
00:48:49,397 --> 00:48:53,835
You can either take the hard things
and make your life better,

814
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:56,248
or make it worse.

815
00:48:56,249 --> 00:48:57,929
Like how?

816
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:06,928
Like trying to see
the good side of Isabel,

817
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,529
and what she brings
to your father's life

818
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,598
and to yours.

819
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,768
You know, there comes
a time in every family

820
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,295
when you've got to
be there for each other.

821
00:49:19,952 --> 00:49:22,023
Okay.

822
00:49:22,024 --> 00:49:23,955
I'll be there for you.

823
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,230
How about you, buddy?

824
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,178
Yeah.

825
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:31,990
You'll be there?

826
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:33,424
Yeah.

827
00:49:44,937 --> 00:49:46,604
Oh, damn it.

828
00:49:56,601 --> 00:49:59,007
What's the problem?

829
00:49:59,726 --> 00:50:01,327
Nothing.

830
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:11,552
It looks good.

831
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:14,740
I can't get the trees
to look real.

832
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:17,437
Hmm.

833
00:50:17,438 --> 00:50:18,976
Mind if I try?

834
00:50:20,827 --> 00:50:23,436
I already messed it up anyway.

835
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:30,552
Let's see. First a
little brush-smooshing.

836
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:32,210
Smooshing.

837
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,153
Very technical term.

838
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,803
Cool. Where'd you
learn how to do that?

839
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:55,272
I took an art class
when I was at NYU.

840
00:50:58,234 --> 00:51:01,403
Why don't you give it a try?

841
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:05,834
It helps if you make
that little "psh-psh."

842
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:17,852
Thanks.

843
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:21,048
You're welcome.

844
00:51:30,835 --> 00:51:33,030
ANNA: I was thinking about
what you said about Isabel.

845
00:51:33,031 --> 00:51:33,873
JACKIE: Uh-huh?

846
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:36,194
You know, seeing the
good side of her,

847
00:51:36,195 --> 00:51:37,921
and, you know, you're right.

848
00:51:37,922 --> 00:51:39,605
She knows all about
clothes and stuff,

849
00:51:39,606 --> 00:51:43,084
and she knows every rock 'n'
roll song ever written.

850
00:51:43,085 --> 00:51:46,358
I mean, she's kind of
like a kid herself.

851
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:48,780
- Like a big sister.
- Yeah.

852
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:51,701
She knows all the cool
junk-food places to eat at.

853
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:53,342
I'll bet.

854
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,545
Once you get to know
her, she's kind of cool.

855
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,811
Yeah?

856
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:02,467
But don't tell her
I told you. I...

857
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:05,592
- I just...
- It's our secret.

858
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,960
Thanks.

859
00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:10,814
ANNA:

Hey. Wow!

875
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:14,853
- Did you have a good day?
- Yeah.

876
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:18,157
Mmm. Well, you are one lucky boy,
because, guess what.

877
00:53:18,158 --> 00:53:20,008
You get to watch a tape tonight.
I'm going out.

878
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:21,578
Colleen's baby-sitting.

879
00:53:21,579 --> 00:53:23,438
Yeah! Cool.

880
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:26,506
And you are
wearing make-up?

881
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,406
- Well, no. Isabel gave it to me.
- Oh.

882
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:33,180
No, she just put a little on
in the car, playing around.

883
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,219
Oh. Well, you
don't usually see that color

884
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,906
in the afternoon,
except on working girls.

885
00:53:39,907 --> 00:53:43,641
Anyway, um... Wash your
face, because, uh,

886
00:53:43,642 --> 00:53:45,625
you and I are going out
in 10 minutes.

887
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:48,427
- On a school night?
- Uh-huh.

888
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,579
- Pearl Jam?
- Yeah.

889
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,078
Oh, Mom, you are the coolest.

890
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:55,880
You only live once, right?

891
00:53:56,337 --> 00:53:59,072
Isn't my mom the coolest?

892
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,442
It was a great idea.
Thanks.

893
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:07,054
Have fun.

894
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,563
Chemotherapy. There's a
day's dose stored here.

895
00:54:21,564 --> 00:54:24,598
This is a portable IV.
Feel it.

896
00:54:25,673 --> 00:54:27,688
- It's pretty light.
- Yeah, nice and slim.

897
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,212
You can wear it everywhere.

898
00:54:29,213 --> 00:54:31,102
Play tennis, jogging.

899
00:54:31,103 --> 00:54:35,271
- You can hide it right under your clothes.
- That's cool.

900
00:54:35,681 --> 00:54:37,048
Side effects?

901
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:41,320
Some days you'll experience
drowsiness, nausea,

902
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:44,930
and then other days,
you'll feel perfectly fine.

903
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:47,415
Am I gonna lose my hair?

904
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:48,207
Maybe.

905
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:51,809
Maybe not.
It varies with each person.

906
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,244
Let's do it.

907
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:57,167
- Good.
- When?

908
00:54:58,517 --> 00:55:00,318
I'm available tomorrow evening.

909
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:03,774
Oh, tomorrow evening's bad.
It's spaghetti and meatball night.

910
00:55:03,775 --> 00:55:08,485
Ben really looks forward...
Okay. Tomorrow's good. Fine.

911
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,774
Hello?

912
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:21,024
Hi, honey.
How are you doing?

913
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:23,899
Mom! I've been
waiting for your call.

914
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,500
- <i>Mom, you're not gonna believe it.</i>
- What?

915
00:55:26,501 --> 00:55:29,586
- <i>I'm telepathetic.</i>
- You mean telepathic.

916
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:31,469
That's what I said.

917
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,485
I just discovered it today.

918
00:55:33,486 --> 00:55:35,439
I can read minds.

919
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,603
<i>No way.</i>

920
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:38,883
Yeah, I just tried it
with Dad and Isabel.

921
00:55:38,884 --> 00:55:41,391
- And guess what.
- <i>What?</i>

922
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:44,711
I always knew exactly
what they were thinking.

923
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:47,750
- That is incredible.
- <i>Want me to read yours?</i>

924
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:50,859
- Absolutely.
- <i>Think real hard about something.</i>

925
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,320
- I'm thinking.
- <i>Close your eyes.</i>

926
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:55,242
Okay.

927
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:59,946
- Concentrate.
- <i>I am concentrating.</i>

928
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,289
You're thinking about me.

929
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:09,001
Wow. That is amazing.

930
00:56:09,002 --> 00:56:10,797
What else?

931
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,406
And you're wishing you were
here instead of where you are.

932
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:17,524
Oh, that's for sure.

933
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:19,789
<i>Where are you, anyway?</i>

934
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:25,344
I'm in bed with the flu,
and I'm green and barfing.

935
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:27,102
<i>I knew that.</i>

936
00:56:27,103 --> 00:56:29,782
And you're wishing you were
here making me spaghetti.

937
00:56:29,783 --> 00:56:33,149
So I wouldn't have
to eat Daddy's sucky lamb chop.

938
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,875
Oh, you're right about that.

939
00:56:34,876 --> 00:56:38,234
- <i>See? I'm pathetelic.</i>
- Telepathic.

940
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:40,503
That's what I said.

941
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:42,141
- Mommy?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

942
00:56:42,142 --> 00:56:43,664
When am I going to see you?

943
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:45,883
<i>Tomorrow, after school.</i>

944
00:56:45,884 --> 00:56:50,487
Oh. I was wishing
I would see you tonight.

945
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:54,297
Well, we're just gonna have to
have one of our dream dates

946
00:56:54,298 --> 00:56:56,922
and meet somewhere
special, in our dreams.

947
00:56:56,923 --> 00:57:00,438
Where haven't we been in a while?
How about Disneyland?

948
00:57:00,439 --> 00:57:03,337
Nah. Last time
the lines were too long.

949
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:05,563
Okay.

950
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:07,657
The beach.

951
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:11,758
Yeah.
On a hot summer day.

952
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:14,508
With gigantic waves.

953
00:57:14,509 --> 00:57:17,289
- And boogie boards.
- <i>And corn dogs.</i>

954
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,766
Yeah. Awesome.

955
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:24,180
Cool. All right, now don't forget
to put on your sun block, okay?

956
00:57:25,423 --> 00:57:28,719
It's a dream, Mom.
You don't need sun block.

957
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:31,927
That's right. I forgot.

958
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:35,852
- <i>Mommy? You still there?</i>
- Yeah.

959
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,688
LUKE: Ben,
time for dinner.

960
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:39,672
I gotta go.
See you tonight, okay?

961
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:41,352
All right.

962
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:43,055
I'll see you in my dreams.

963
00:57:43,056 --> 00:57:45,690
- <i>Bye, Mom. I love you.</i>
- Bye.

964
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:11,859
She doesn't really have that
killer instinct, does she?

965
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,026
Defense, fall back.

966
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:20,266
- Hey.
- Hey.

967
00:58:32,782 --> 00:58:34,249
Are you feeling all right?

968
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:36,594
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm great.

969
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:37,758
You look a little bit tired.

970
00:58:37,759 --> 00:58:39,703
I hate when
people say that.

971
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:43,524
It's a polite way of telling you
'you look like shit'.

972
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:48,758
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm just...
- I have some things on my mind.

973
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,786
You've been really busy lately.

974
00:58:57,647 --> 00:59:00,974
Are you seeing somebody?

975
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:06,943
Ah, no. I wish that was
the reason I was tired.

976
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:08,644
I... Um...

977
00:59:11,342 --> 00:59:13,849
I've been spending a little
time with my old boss,

978
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,490
trying to decide whether or not I'm
gonna go back to Random House.

979
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:19,591
- Really? That would be great.
- Yeah.

980
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:22,694
Oh, Ben.
Easy, easy, easy.

981
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:27,755
Ben, Ben, Ben, be careful, sweetie.

982
00:59:27,756 --> 00:59:30,278
You are a dead man,
Captain Blood.

983
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:32,771
Ow!

984
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:35,305
Ben. Ben.

985
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:41,931
Ow.

986
00:59:42,863 --> 00:59:44,822
Man, that was really cool.

987
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:47,017
- Sweetie, can you move your leg?
- Yeah.

988
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:48,540
- Does it hurt?
- No.

989
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:49,892
Are you okay?

990
00:59:49,893 --> 00:59:54,061
Yeah, but can I still go
to Tucker's party tomorrow?

991
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:58,866
Um, probably. But we gotta get it cleaned
up and have somebody look at it, okay?

992
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:00,304
Gotta go to the emergency room.

993
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,238
LUKE: Yeah.

994
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,709
<i></i>

995
01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:14,958
- Five stitches.
- Is he okay?

996
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,037
- Yeah, he's doing fine.
- He's not crying?

997
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:18,772
Can I see my son now, please?

998
01:00:18,773 --> 01:00:20,747
NURSE: I need your
insurance information.

999
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:22,115
- Here, I'll do this.
- Oh, thanks.

1000
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:24,149
He's in 152.

1001
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:31,919
I don't see any broken bones.

1002
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,388
'Cause you don't have any.

1003
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:36,841
I'm very proud of you.
You were awfully brave today.

1004
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,209
It didn't hurt that bad.

1005
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,623
Besides, it'll be cool to
show my friends.

1006
01:00:40,624 --> 01:00:41,723
Yeah.

1007
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:44,052
Hey, would you do me a favor?

1008
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:47,670
Um... Maybe.
Depends what it is.

1009
01:00:47,671 --> 01:00:51,092
Will you ask Dad to give me
a white dove for Christmas?

1010
01:00:51,093 --> 01:00:53,333
- We'll see.
- Come on!

1011
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:57,505
Every magician needs a white
dove, a real one. They do.

1012
01:00:57,506 --> 01:00:59,389
Well, that's a long way off,

1013
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,154
and I think that we should talk
to your mom and just see, okay?

1014
01:01:02,155 --> 01:01:03,482
Ow, ow, ow.

1015
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:05,717
- Did it hurt again?
- Yeah.

1016
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:09,137
Lay back.
Take a deep breath.

1017
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,552
Will you sing me a song?

1018
01:01:14,553 --> 01:01:18,188
My mom always sings
to me when I get hurt.

1019
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:22,570
Okay, um,

1020
01:01:24,198 --> 01:01:27,734

01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,626
ISABEL: Puts a girl
on the spot.

1032
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,687
<i></i>

1033
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:14,229
ISABEL: <i>Hello?</i>

1034
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:16,564
- Hi, it's Jackie.
- <i>Hi.</i>

1035
01:03:16,565 --> 01:03:18,776
Look, I just got a call
from Random House,

1036
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:21,400
and they want me to come in and
meet an editor this afternoon,

1037
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:24,751
but I'm afraid I won't get back in time to
pick up Ben at Tucker's birthday party.

1038
01:03:24,752 --> 01:03:27,314
- Do you...
- <i>Yeah, no problem. I can do it.</i>

1039
01:03:27,315 --> 01:03:28,481
Oh, good, great.

1040
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:29,782
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

1041
01:03:29,784 --> 01:03:31,684
Yeah, well...

1042
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,572
Ben'll be happy, too,

1043
01:03:34,979 --> 01:03:36,353
that you'll pick him up, yeah.

1044
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,751
- <i>What time?</i>
- It's 4:30.

1045
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:39,963
<i>What's the address?</i>

1046
01:03:39,964 --> 01:03:42,767
At 22 Williams Road.

1047
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:44,986
<i>Okay, I'll be there.</i>

1048
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,019
Great.

1049
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:47,955
<i>Sure. See you later.</i>

1050
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,957
- Thanks.
- <i>Bye.</i>

1051
01:04:35,963 --> 01:04:39,065
How hard can this be?

1052
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,408
Okay.

1053
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:55,214
It's gonna be okay.

1054
01:05:01,556 --> 01:05:02,892
<i>OPERATOR:
Directory assistance. What city?</i>

1055
01:05:02,893 --> 01:05:04,587
- Manhattan.
- <i>What listing?</i>

1056
01:05:04,588 --> 01:05:06,540
The number for
Random House, please.

1057
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:08,048
<i>Please hold.</i>

1058
01:05:10,494 --> 01:05:11,394
WOMAN: <i>Hello.</i>

1059
01:05:11,396 --> 01:05:13,540
Hi, may I speak with
Jackie Harrison, please?

1060
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:16,008
<i>I'm sorry.
Mrs. Harrison's not here.</i>

1061
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,277
No, she has a meeting
with the editor today.

1062
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:21,759
I'm picking up Benjamin from a birthday
party, and I lost the address.

1063
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,056
I just need to speak to her
for one quick second.

1064
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:25,697
<i>Um, Miss, I'm the senior editor.</i>

1065
01:05:25,698 --> 01:05:31,435
<i>I haven't seen Mrs. Harrison since
she left Random House 11 years ago.</i>

1066
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,395
Uh, okay.

1067
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:37,226
Um, thanks anyway.

1068
01:05:37,227 --> 01:05:39,627
- <i>Balloons.</i>
- I beg your pardon?

1069
01:05:39,628 --> 01:05:45,142
<i>Just look for a house with balloons.
It never fails. The kids'll be there.</i>

1070
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:47,378
Thanks very much.

1071
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,127
JACKIE: Hey.

1072
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:35,790
Hey, look at you.

1073
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,790
Come here.

1074
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:39,978
Can you see me?
Hi.

1075
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:41,407
You had a good time, huh?

1076
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:42,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

1077
01:06:43,526 --> 01:06:44,806
- Hello.
- Hi.

1078
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:47,603
Let's get that shirt cleaned.
How was Tucker's party?

1079
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,537
- Good.
- Yeah?

1080
01:06:50,165 --> 01:06:52,023
- Did he like the present?
- Yeah.

1081
01:06:52,024 --> 01:06:53,857
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1082
01:06:54,288 --> 01:06:56,217
JACKIE: Did they have
the snake guy or...

1083
01:06:56,218 --> 01:06:56,967
BEN: Snake!

1084
01:06:56,968 --> 01:06:58,668
JACKIE: The snake guy.

1085
01:06:59,788 --> 01:07:01,120
BEN: It bit Tucker.

1086
01:07:01,122 --> 01:07:03,990
- It bit Tucker?
- Did it eat him?

1087
01:07:37,327 --> 01:07:40,490
Did you have any trouble finding
the place with my directions?

1088
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:42,147
No.

1089
01:07:42,148 --> 01:07:43,814
Well, thanks.

1090
01:07:50,218 --> 01:07:52,319
I know your secret.

1091
01:07:54,812 --> 01:07:57,326
I saw the airline tickets and
the note from your new boss.

1092
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:00,803
I know you're not working at Random
House in New York. I talked to them.

1093
01:08:00,804 --> 01:08:03,889
You're taking the kids
and moving to Los Angeles.

1094
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:07,858
What the hell are you doing reading my
mail and snooping around behind my back

1095
01:08:07,859 --> 01:08:10,334
like some little dishonest...

1096
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:15,921
Dishonest? I wouldn't have to snoop
around if you were honest with Luke.

1097
01:08:16,632 --> 01:08:19,359
I would have thought this was
the answer to your prayers.

1098
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,264
You lose the witch and her two
little brats in one swoop.

1099
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,412
Simplifies everything.
You get your life back.

1100
01:08:25,413 --> 01:08:27,952
Come on. There are plenty of
publishing houses in New York.

1101
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:29,748
Surely you can get a job here.

1102
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:34,342
So I'm supposed to rearrange my life so
that I can accommodate your schedule?

1103
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,959
If you are so damned concerned,

1104
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,393
why don't you get a new career?

1105
01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:39,678
Why don't you and Luke
move to Los Angeles?

1106
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,897
Oh, but you can make plans to rearrange
everyone else's life without consulting us.

1107
01:08:43,898 --> 01:08:46,787
Bicoastal parenting.
People do it all the time.

1108
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:49,811
Luke gets the kids one month during
the summer and every other holiday.

1109
01:08:49,812 --> 01:08:51,359
It's not ideal,
but people make it work.

1110
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,600
No, you can't do that. You can't
take Luke's kids away from him!

1111
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:55,101
Yes, I can.

1112
01:08:55,102 --> 01:08:56,725
No, we can't live like that.

1113
01:08:56,726 --> 01:08:58,529
We?

1114
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,230
Look. Luke has a problem with this,
you tell him to talk to me.

1115
01:09:01,232 --> 01:09:04,733
This is not about you.
This is not your problem.

1116
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:06,200
It is my problem.

1117
01:09:06,202 --> 01:09:07,526
Why is that?

1118
01:09:08,472 --> 01:09:12,596
Because I'm going to marry this man and
we're going to share our life together.

1119
01:09:12,597 --> 01:09:14,437
I love him.

1120
01:09:15,605 --> 01:09:21,452
These kids are everything to him and he
would be devastated not to be near them.

1121
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:23,614
And if...

1122
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:32,506
Huh.

1123
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:49,210
You guessed the wrong secret.

1124
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:56,536
Charlie Drummond is, um,

1125
01:09:56,537 --> 01:10:00,803
a colleague of mine from Random
House in New York, and she...

1126
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:05,216
She moved to the west coast office
and I'm gonna be crashing with her

1127
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:07,592
while I'm getting
protein injections

1128
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:10,795
that are recommended
by my oncologist.

1129
01:10:10,796 --> 01:10:13,763
You can only get
them in Los Angeles.

1130
01:10:13,764 --> 01:10:15,664
Oncologist?

1131
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:18,232
Yeah.
Life's a tradeoff.

1132
01:10:18,233 --> 01:10:22,869
It's finally legal to smoke dope,
but you gotta have cancer.

1133
01:10:27,819 --> 01:10:29,720
Are you dying?

1134
01:10:35,094 --> 01:10:37,695
Not today.

1135
01:10:46,514 --> 01:10:48,146
We'll beat it.

1136
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,943
- It's a walk in the park.
- Yeah.

1137
01:10:52,389 --> 01:10:54,724
Thanks for the "we."

1138
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,373
You're not alone
in this, you know.

1139
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:04,896
You don't have to go
through this by yourself.

1140
01:11:04,897 --> 01:11:06,730
You know that.

1141
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:10,800
You understand what I'm saying?

1142
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:23,312
What are we gonna
tell the kids?

1143
01:11:25,516 --> 01:11:29,252
I think we should
tell them the truth.

1144
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,930
They can handle it.

1145
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:41,857
It should have
been me instead of you.

1146
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,536
I'll go along with that.

1147
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:05,089
Look out.

1148
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:07,161
You didn't see.

1149
01:12:07,162 --> 01:12:08,786
Whoosh! Gotcha.

1150
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:11,396
JACKIE: I don't
understand what to do.

1151
01:12:11,397 --> 01:12:12,429
ANNA: They're organic.

1152
01:12:12,431 --> 01:12:15,155
Did he beat you?
Here, look, 35 marshmallows.

1153
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:18,035
35. Your sister put them in.

1154
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,119
So, what's going on?
Who's gonna marry who this time?

1155
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,682
Mommy's marrying Isabel.

1156
01:12:23,683 --> 01:12:24,657
Oh, so cute.

1157
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,884
Oh, no.

1158
01:12:28,885 --> 01:12:30,313
Guys, Mommy's sick.

1159
01:12:30,314 --> 01:12:31,626
You still have the flu?

1160
01:12:31,627 --> 01:12:33,892
No, I have cancer.

1161
01:12:33,893 --> 01:12:36,306
Do you know what that is?

1162
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:41,268
It's what Aunt Mary died from.

1163
01:12:42,049 --> 01:12:43,641
Aunt Mary had a different kind.

1164
01:12:43,642 --> 01:12:48,267
There are lots of different kinds,
and hers was very, very bad.

1165
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:52,564
Is yours bad?

1166
01:12:53,524 --> 01:12:56,298
I've been working with a doctor
to get better for a while now,

1167
01:12:56,299 --> 01:12:59,907
and she says we have
every reason to hope

1168
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,375
that I'm gonna be fine.

1169
01:13:03,577 --> 01:13:04,657
Huh.

1170
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:07,509
Check this out, Anna.
Look at this.

1171
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:08,766
This is so cool.

1172
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,333
No, it's okay.

1173
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:14,358
Look at this. I don't even have to go
to the hospital to get my medicine.

1174
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:15,656
It comes right in this.

1175
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,999
This looks like Game Boy.

1176
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,312
It kind of is, huh?

1177
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,686
It's gonna make me strong,
so I can fight the disease.

1178
01:13:21,687 --> 01:13:23,721
It's cool, huh?

1179
01:13:24,672 --> 01:13:26,296
Can I catch cancer?

1180
01:13:26,297 --> 01:13:28,997
No, sweetie.
It's not contagious.

1181
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:32,429
So you've known about
this for a long time?

1182
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:35,312
Yeah.

1183
01:13:35,313 --> 01:13:36,983
And you never told me.

1184
01:13:36,984 --> 01:13:41,719
Sweetheart, your mom wanted to wait
until the right time to tell you.

1185
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,460
Oh, guys, I'm sorry.
Look, I just...

1186
01:13:46,094 --> 01:13:47,874
I know how scared
I get when you're sick,

1187
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:51,694
and I thought it would be best to wait
for a while until it got smaller.

1188
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:54,624
So you lied! You lied
when you never told me.

1189
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:58,171
If you lied then, maybe you're lying now.
I can never believe you again!

1190
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:01,339
I made a mistake.
Anna, people make mistakes.

1191
01:14:02,141 --> 01:14:04,437
- Where's Isabel?
- What?

1192
01:14:04,438 --> 01:14:06,288
It's Thursday. We're
supposed to be with Isabel.

1193
01:14:06,289 --> 01:14:07,492
She should have
picked us up by now.

1194
01:14:07,493 --> 01:14:08,812
I'd rather be with Mommy.

1195
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:11,530
Well, she's dying.
Isabel is your mother now.

1196
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,598
Anna, don't say that!

1197
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:17,603
Anna!

1198
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:21,479
You do not run out
on your mother.

of course in the 6th grade doesn't mean anything.

They don't even have lunch together.

I had kids of my own once.

in the lunch yard,

1297
01:19:14,593 --> 01:19:18,671
he announces publicly, in front of
her friends, that he's breaking up.

Not you. Just go.

1300
01:19:24,664 --> 01:19:26,569
Anyway, that's the whole
point of going out, right?

1301
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:28,374
So that one of them
can dump the other one,

1302
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:33,491
and they can act out this passionate,
adult soap opera tragedy.

1303
01:19:33,492 --> 01:19:34,866
She must be devastated.

1304
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:36,038

that you'd want to spend
the rest of your life with?

No.

It's just every time I'm
in the lunch yard

1329
01:20:56,792 --> 01:20:59,561
and he's with 10 of his
butt-kissing little weasels...

They all yell, "There goes the
virgin queen" or "the ice princess"

1332
01:21:05,132 --> 01:21:08,811
or some real clever cut like
that, like it hurts my feelings.

1333
01:21:08,812 --> 01:21:11,522

1337
01:21:22,876 --> 01:21:23,727
Mom.

1338
01:21:23,728 --> 01:21:25,728
Oh, sorry.
Okay, right.

1339
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,789
What do you say to him when
he says something like that?

1340
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:33,484
I call him a fart face or pervert
or something equally lame.

1341
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:36,399
Sweetheart, you have
to just ignore him.

1342
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,540
He doesn't exist. You don't see him.
You don't hear him.

1343
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,875
He's just nothing.
He's not there.

1344
01:21:41,876 --> 01:21:44,273
You are too much
of a woman

1345
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:49,311
to even bother with such
a little boy as him.

1346
01:21:50,187 --> 01:21:51,154
You're kidding, right?

1347
01:21:51,155 --> 01:21:53,311
No, all he wants
is the attention.

1348
01:21:53,312 --> 01:21:55,803
Once he doesn't get it,
he might try harder,

1349
01:21:55,804 --> 01:21:58,600
but then he'll get
frustrated and give up.

1350
01:21:58,601 --> 01:22:01,014
So I just ignore him,
keep my mouth shut.

1351

Yep.

1352
01:22:03,796 --> 01:22:06,444
Well, you think Isabel
would do that?

1353
01:22:08,187 --> 01:22:13,356
It's just she's younger.
Maybe she remembers how to do this.

1354
01:22:14,474 --> 01:22:16,875
So this'll work, huh?

1355

01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:13,199
There's a loophole, you know.

1366
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:19,653
You can say "never, never" if you
mean it enough to say it twice.

1367
01:24:26,612 --> 01:24:29,614
I'll remember always, always.

1368
01:24:31,517 --> 01:24:34,619
Promise, promise.

1369
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:04,536
<i>MAN OVER PA: Let's have that carriage move back
to the end of the street and start again.</i>

1370
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:08,632
<i>Everybody, keep moving.</i>

1371
01:25:11,997 --> 01:25:14,285
<i>Go back to the starting point,
turn around and come back.</i>

1372
01:25:14,286 --> 01:25:15,816
It's 1:45.

1373
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,168
COOPER: Want a lens?

1374
01:25:20,169 --> 01:25:22,169
Thanks, everybody!
That's a wrap!

1375
01:25:22,171 --> 01:25:25,230
Thank you for
a great day, folks.

1376
01:25:25,231 --> 01:25:26,597
- <i>MAN: That's a wrap everybody.</i>
- No.

1377
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:29,332
It's 1:45. I told you I have
to pick up Anna and Benjamin.

1378
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:31,067
Thanks, guys.

1379
01:25:31,068 --> 01:25:32,762
You're not...
You have to finish.

1380
01:25:32,763 --> 01:25:35,434
No. I've got it. It's in the can.
Coop can wrap the equipment.

1381
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:37,841
This is my star account.

1382
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:41,082
These clients need choices.
They need variety.

1383
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:44,590
I've shot at 20 different angles,
so they'll have plenty of variety.

1384
01:25:44,591 --> 01:25:47,025
- Trust me.
- I don't.

1385
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:51,937
What are you saying?

1386
01:25:53,817 --> 01:25:57,352
I'm saying that...
That you're the best I've got.

1387
01:25:57,353 --> 01:26:00,329
Probably the best
I've ever worked with.

1388
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:04,767
But these last couple of
months, your work is slipping.

1389
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:07,555
It's still fine,
but you've lost your edge,

1390
01:26:07,556 --> 01:26:10,524
your focus, your dedication.

1391
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:14,188
And your attitude

1392
01:26:14,189 --> 01:26:16,723
is very disappointing.

1393
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:21,493
You're making
a career decision here.

1394
01:26:22,955 --> 01:26:27,092
If you walk now, I'm gonna
have to let you go.

1395
01:26:34,892 --> 01:26:37,861
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1396
01:26:41,266 --> 01:26:42,933
Isabel.

1397
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:48,304
Oh, damn.

1398
01:26:50,361 --> 01:26:54,626
It's okay, don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

1399
01:27:13,423 --> 01:27:15,283
Hey, guys.

1400
01:27:15,284 --> 01:27:17,026
Sorry I'm late.

1401
01:27:22,892 --> 01:27:24,235
- Hey, Benjamin?
- Yeah?

1402
01:27:24,236 --> 01:27:25,963
Why don't you go sit
in the car, buddy?

1403
01:27:25,964 --> 01:27:27,094
Okay.

1404
01:27:27,095 --> 01:27:29,963
- Don't drive away.
- I won't.

1405
01:27:30,509 --> 01:27:32,243
What happened?

1406
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:38,016
You know that boy I was telling
you about, Brad Kovitsky?

1407
01:27:38,017 --> 01:27:39,642
Yeah.

1408
01:27:39,643 --> 01:27:41,797
Well, he's been
a real jerk lately.

1409
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,829
My mom told me to ignore him.

1410
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,415
So today,

1411
01:27:45,416 --> 01:27:47,071
I did.

1412
01:27:47,072 --> 01:27:49,665
- And you know what he called me?
- No.

1413
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:54,499
He called me "Frosty the Snow
Bitch" in front of everyone.

1414
01:27:55,274 --> 01:27:57,741
Well, men can be scum.

1415
01:27:58,679 --> 01:27:59,952
Yes, they can.

1416
01:27:59,953 --> 01:28:02,288
Is that little bastard around here?
I'll kick his ass.

1417
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:05,085
No, his mother's
always on time.

1418
01:28:10,296 --> 01:28:11,656
I have an idea.

1419
01:28:11,657 --> 01:28:14,944
No, thanks. I don't need
advice from a stepmother.

1420
01:28:17,289 --> 01:28:18,968
Oh.

1421
01:28:20,281 --> 01:28:22,015
Okay, yeah.

1422
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:27,227
I can see how sitting out here
in the cold and snow, crying,

1423
01:28:27,228 --> 01:28:33,329
seems like a far superior idea
to listening to a stepmother.

1424
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:37,266
But, for kicks,
let's lose the title.

1425
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:39,665
Seems to me you have a choice.

1426
01:28:39,666 --> 01:28:41,705
You can either pretend
to be an adult,

1427
01:28:41,706 --> 01:28:43,977
or you can actually be one.

1428
01:28:43,978 --> 01:28:46,412
So,

1429
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:51,005
sit here in the cold, crying,

1430
01:28:51,831 --> 01:28:54,112
by yourself,

1431
01:28:54,113 --> 01:28:58,924
or do something about it,

1432
01:28:58,925 --> 01:29:00,593
together.

1433
01:29:02,144 --> 01:29:03,677
Crying.

1434
01:29:04,691 --> 01:29:06,325
Do something.

1435
01:29:08,331 --> 01:29:09,564
Hmm?

1436
01:29:10,269 --> 01:29:12,771
What's it gonna be?

1437
01:29:15,339 --> 01:29:17,140
Do something.

1438
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,839
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1439
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:25,392
Well, can we start by covering
up my hairy stepmother wart?

1440
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,204
Because it must be showing.

1441
01:29:29,932 --> 01:29:31,556
You punk.

1442
01:29:31,557 --> 01:29:35,111
It's cold. Come on, let's go.
Benjamin will drive us home.

01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:49,579
- after school...
- Oh, come on!

1449
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:54,274
...you walk up to him
with attitude.

1450
01:29:54,275 --> 01:29:56,399
You hear me?

1451
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,118
And you say,
"Listen up, limp dick,

1452
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:05,282
"'cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

1455
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:20,517
"who doesn't even know

1456
01:30:20,908 --> 01:30:22,477
Uh...

1457
01:30:22,478 --> 01:30:24,211
What is it?

1458
01:30:24,728 --> 01:30:26,295
Hmm. Uh...

1459
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:30,899
It's an...

1460
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,470
It's an incredibly disgusting and
not even remotely sexy thing

1461
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:36,954
that I once heard described in a movie
that I would never take you to go see.

1462
01:30:36,955 --> 01:30:38,516
But it is real.

1463
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:40,477
Now,

1464
01:30:40,478 --> 01:30:42,445
the clincher.

1465
01:30:43,322 --> 01:30:45,860
You walk away,

1466
01:30:45,861 --> 01:30:48,275
then you

1467
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,665
whip around

1468
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,866
and say,

1469
01:30:53,432 --> 01:30:55,751
"The guy I see
is in high school,

1470
01:30:55,752 --> 01:30:58,321
"and it has to be said,

1471
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:03,030
"he laughs his ass off
whenever we talk about you."

1472
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:06,179
But I don't know anyone
in high school.

1473
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,374
There will be a suitable boy

1474
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:15,460
outside your school on Monday at
2:30 with a very expensive bike,

1475
01:31:15,461 --> 01:31:17,991
and he will be a stone fox,

1476
01:31:17,992 --> 01:31:21,031
even if I have to call
an escort service.

1477
01:31:21,937 --> 01:31:24,265
I've had the worst day,

1478
01:31:24,266 --> 01:31:25,932
until now.

1479
01:31:28,641 --> 01:31:30,074
Me, too.

ANNA: Surprise!

1486
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:58,550
Why is she in a wheelchair?

1487
01:31:58,551 --> 01:32:03,128
She's traveled a long way and she's tired,
so give her a hug and be real gentle.

1488
01:32:03,129 --> 01:32:05,878
Look at this guy.
Hi!

Let's go home, huh?

1490
01:32:09,145 --> 01:32:10,128
Welcome back.

1491
01:32:10,129 --> 01:32:13,457
JACKIE: Thanks.
What a great surprise.

1492
01:32:26,277 --> 01:32:28,449
BEN: Hey, let me out!
Come on!

1493
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:30,472
- JACKIE: Who's gotta get out?
- BEN: Let me out!

1494

- BEN: Hey!
- ANNA: Sorry.

1495
01:32:33,801 --> 01:32:35,542
I'm in the family, too,
you know.

1496
01:32:35,543 --> 01:32:36,975
Thank you.

1497
01:32:45,754 --> 01:32:46,597
JACKIE: What's up?

1498
01:32:46,598 --> 01:32:48,261
We have a surprise for you.

1499
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:49,816
- No way!
- Yes.

1500
01:32:49,817 --> 01:32:51,565
- What is it?
- We can't tell you. It won't be a surprise.

1501
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,956
Yes, you can. Tell me.

1502
01:32:52,957 --> 01:32:55,237
- Ben, tell me.
- No way.

1503
01:32:55,238 --> 01:32:57,672
- Come on, tell me.
- No way.

1504
01:32:57,674 --> 01:32:58,847
Close your eyes.

1505
01:33:00,918 --> 01:33:03,394
BEN: Step, step.

1506
01:33:03,395 --> 01:33:06,629
No, almost. You're almost there.
Don't open your eyes.

1507
01:33:06,631 --> 01:33:08,511
Come on, please,
just a little peek?

1508
01:33:08,512 --> 01:33:10,417
Oh, gosh.

1509
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,175
No, wait. Come in.

1510
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:13,988
Come in.
All right, ready?

1511
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:17,524
One, two, three, open!

1512
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:27,965
Oh.

1513
01:33:37,082 --> 01:33:38,983
Wow.

1514
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,698
Isn't it great?

1515
01:33:46,699 --> 01:33:48,632
Isabel did it.

1516
01:34:02,348 --> 01:34:04,128
- Isabel.
- Yeah?

1517
01:34:04,129 --> 01:34:08,292
Um, I'm working on a Christmas
project for Ben and Anna,

1518
01:34:08,293 --> 01:34:11,597
and there aren't any recent
photos of me with the kids,

1519
01:34:11,598 --> 01:34:15,058
and I was... I was
just wondering if, um,

1520
01:34:15,059 --> 01:34:17,026
you'd take some.

1521
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:19,811
Sure. Love to.

1522
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:22,382
Thanks.

1523
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:30,948
BEN: Hey, guys, wait up.
Wait up for me.

1524
01:34:37,106 --> 01:34:40,277
Stop right there for a second.
Oh, great.

1525
01:34:41,145 --> 01:34:42,277
ISABEL: Perfect.

1526
01:34:42,278 --> 01:34:44,831
Benjamin, that's a dazzling
display of horsemanship.

1527
01:34:44,832 --> 01:34:47,980
Come on, you lazy horse.
Giddap!

1528
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:50,402
No, no!

1529
01:35:00,512 --> 01:35:03,269
JACKIE: "One day, five men
came in very funny hats

01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,588
That was the first time he fell.

1537
01:35:56,589 --> 01:35:59,994
Awesome fall.
You're gonna try it again?

1538
01:35:59,995 --> 01:36:00,995
BEN: Yeah.

1539
01:36:00,996 --> 01:36:02,260
One over here, everybody.

1540
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:05,863
- Oh, cheese!
- Cheese.

1541
01:36:07,714 --> 01:36:09,408
- Are you gonna go back?
- Yeah.

1542
01:36:09,409 --> 01:36:10,741
- For more?
- Yeah.

1543
01:36:10,743 --> 01:36:12,176
All right.

1544
01:36:12,178 --> 01:36:14,545
Go for it.
I'm watching.

1545
01:36:20,886 --> 01:36:23,541
You know, Ben was born in two hours,
went straight to the breast,

1546
01:36:23,542 --> 01:36:26,494
and camped there
for the next four days,

1547
01:36:26,495 --> 01:36:30,633
always with this mischievous
look on his face,

1548
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:33,837
like he had a secret
or something.

1549
01:36:33,838 --> 01:36:38,008
And his, uh, blanket
always looked like a cape.

1550
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:40,709
Even the nurses said so.

1551
01:36:41,376 --> 01:36:44,157
He loves hearing that
story over and over,

1552
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:47,360
about how he was
born a magician.

1553
01:36:48,213 --> 01:36:49,985
And her?

1554
01:36:49,986 --> 01:36:52,220
Twenty-eight hours.

1555
01:36:52,838 --> 01:36:56,633
The doctors wanted
to go in and get her, but...

1556
01:36:56,634 --> 01:36:58,821
I knew she'd come
in her own time.

1557
01:36:58,822 --> 01:37:01,589
That's just the way she is.

1558
01:37:01,591 --> 01:37:04,292
Can't let anybody rush her.

1559
01:37:05,261 --> 01:37:07,929
I'll keep that in mind.

1560
01:37:10,099 --> 01:37:12,066
BEN: Ow!

1561
01:37:29,314 --> 01:37:31,470
Didn't work, did it?

1562
01:37:31,994 --> 01:37:33,555
I'm sorry.

1563
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:36,946
Hey, you did
everything you could.

1564
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:39,923
But there's still
some options available.

1565
01:37:39,924 --> 01:37:42,782
There's a treatment in Paris,
one in Switzerland,

1566
01:37:42,783 --> 01:37:44,244
and they come
highly recommended.

1567
01:37:44,245 --> 01:37:46,034
Thanks, but...

1568
01:37:47,768 --> 01:37:51,611
I think I wanna spend
my time at home,

1569
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:54,229
with my family.

1570
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,520
Yeah.

1571
01:38:00,722 --> 01:38:03,963
Christmas will be here
before you know it.

1572
01:38:44,534 --> 01:38:46,111
I thought you might
need one of these.

1573
01:38:46,112 --> 01:38:47,509
I do.

1574
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,104
It looks great.

1575
01:38:58,457 --> 01:38:59,938
Wait a minute.

1576
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:01,492
A little more.

1577
01:39:01,493 --> 01:39:04,008
A little more.
Okay.

1578
01:39:04,009 --> 01:39:06,586
I think that's fine.
Stop.

1579
01:39:06,587 --> 01:39:08,353
Oh, perfect.

1580
01:39:09,314 --> 01:39:11,448
Smells great, too.

1581
01:39:12,249 --> 01:39:13,399
Mmm.

1582
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,732
Thanks.

1583
01:39:28,236 --> 01:39:31,972
What are we supposed
to do without you?

1584
01:39:33,197 --> 01:39:35,265
You'll be fine.

1585
01:39:36,431 --> 01:39:38,799
You're a great father.

1586
01:39:43,681 --> 01:39:45,641
I just never really...

1587
01:39:45,642 --> 01:39:49,677
I didn't give you
the chance to realize it.

1588
01:39:55,727 --> 01:39:57,995
Thank you.

1589
01:40:01,884 --> 01:40:03,851
Merry Christmas.

1590
01:40:23,766 --> 01:40:27,110
ANNA: As for your pitiful knowledge
of what a woman really wants,

1591
01:40:27,111 --> 01:40:29,511
I'm not wasting my time
on some pathetic loser

1592
01:40:29,512 --> 01:40:31,110
who doesn't even know
what snow-blowing is.

1593
01:40:31,111 --> 01:40:32,438
BOYS: Ooh, loser!

1594
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:34,258
Anna, good one.

1595
01:40:34,259 --> 01:40:36,703
Oh, and the guy I see
is in high school,

1596
01:40:36,704 --> 01:40:42,492
and it has to be said that every time we
talk about you, he laughs his ass off.

1597
01:40:42,493 --> 01:40:44,414
Yeah, right.

1598
01:40:44,415 --> 01:40:48,571
You don't believe me?
He's standing right over there.

1599
01:41:00,064 --> 01:41:01,664
No way.

1600
01:41:02,165 --> 01:41:04,220
Well, believe it.

1601
01:41:12,392 --> 01:41:14,559
You rule, Anna!
You really rule!

1602
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,220
- You blew it.
- Loser.

1603
01:41:16,221 --> 01:41:19,368
- He's a model.
- You're such a retard.

1604
01:41:19,369 --> 01:41:22,204
BOY 1: Loser.
BOY 2: Yeah, I know.

1605
01:41:24,539 --> 01:41:26,641
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

1606
01:41:26,642 --> 01:41:29,328
I'm here to pick up
my kids from school.

1607
01:41:29,329 --> 01:41:31,762
Who is that?

1608
01:41:32,978 --> 01:41:35,242
He looks familiar. He looks like
that guy that's in his underwear

1609
01:41:35,243 --> 01:41:36,676
on the side of a bus
for Calvin Klein.

1610
01:41:36,678 --> 01:41:38,227
No, fully dressed
for Ralph Lauren.

1611
01:41:38,228 --> 01:41:39,172
- What?
- What?

1612
01:41:39,173 --> 01:41:40,321
- Huh?
- No.

1613
01:41:40,322 --> 01:41:41,688
Oh!

1614
01:41:43,072 --> 01:41:45,005
GIRL: Go, Anna!

1615
01:41:46,431 --> 01:41:48,040
GIRL: He's such a loser.

1616
01:41:49,595 --> 01:41:51,110
Moron.

1617
01:41:55,829 --> 01:41:58,883
Oh, it worked, it worked,
it worked, it worked!

1618
01:42:00,978 --> 01:42:02,977
Did you see the look
on Brad's face?

1619
01:42:02,978 --> 01:42:05,540
- Thank you so much!
- Oh, honey.

1620
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:14,133
JACKIE:
Okay, "limp dick" I know.

1621
01:42:14,134 --> 01:42:16,968
What exactly
is "snow-blowing"?

1622
01:42:18,142 --> 01:42:20,242
It doesn't matter. I
didn't explain it to her.

1623
01:42:20,243 --> 01:42:21,781
You're gonna have
to explain it to me,

1624
01:42:21,782 --> 01:42:24,422
because I'm gonna have to explain
it to about 20 or 30 parents

1625
01:42:24,423 --> 01:42:26,490
that are gonna call
in the next half-hour.

1626
01:42:26,492 --> 01:42:27,357
Give them my number.

1627
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:30,555
I think they're gonna wanna talk
to Anna's mother, thank you.

1628
01:42:30,556 --> 01:42:34,835
What is it that you're worried about?
Looking bad at the PTA?

1629
01:42:34,836 --> 01:42:36,577
Are you defending what you did?

1630
01:42:36,578 --> 01:42:37,491
Right to the ground.

1631
01:42:37,492 --> 01:42:38,858
You put filth
in my child's mouth.

1632
01:42:38,859 --> 01:42:41,272
- Oh, please.
- You had her lie about that model.

1633
01:42:41,273 --> 01:42:44,569
And it worked like a charm.

1634
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:48,305
And you became a hero,
and I became a schmuck.

1635
01:42:48,898 --> 01:42:52,272
Basically, you taught my child

1636
01:42:52,273 --> 01:42:57,343
that I am a loser who doesn't
really care about her pain.

1637
01:42:57,344 --> 01:42:58,841
That's not what
I was trying to do.

1638
01:42:58,842 --> 01:43:00,920
Well, that's what you did.

1639
01:43:00,921 --> 01:43:04,903
Did you think that I didn't have some
dirty words for that little putz?

1640
01:43:04,904 --> 01:43:06,950
That I couldn't figure
out some low blows?

1641
01:43:06,951 --> 01:43:08,484
You weren't passing them out.

1642
01:43:08,486 --> 01:43:12,216
I believe, in a crisis, you have
an opportunity to learn something.

1643
01:43:12,217 --> 01:43:14,384
That's deep.

1644
01:43:14,386 --> 01:43:16,231
It was a lie.

1645
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:19,810
Winning without dignity
or grace is not winning.

1646
01:43:19,811 --> 01:43:23,513
She has to figure out who she is so
she can stand up to peer pressure,

1647
01:43:23,514 --> 01:43:25,872
so that she can steer
her own course.

1648
01:43:25,873 --> 01:43:30,200
She wasn't steering her own course.
She was steering yours.

1649
01:43:30,201 --> 01:43:33,736
Oh! That's what parenting
is all about, little girl.

1650
01:43:33,738 --> 01:43:36,856
They are pleading for you to tell
them how to do the right thing,

1651
01:43:36,857 --> 01:43:39,544
and sure as hell,
that's what you've done.

1652
01:43:39,545 --> 01:43:42,850
The next time something happens
and the stakes are really high,

1653
01:43:42,851 --> 01:43:45,020
she's gonna look back on this
and she's gonna remember

1654
01:43:45,021 --> 01:43:47,224
how easy it was
and how good it felt.

1655
01:43:47,225 --> 01:43:51,138
And she's going to stand up for herself.
Dear God, what have I done?

1656
01:43:51,139 --> 01:43:54,740
You have turned her into you.

1657
01:43:56,646 --> 01:43:59,411
That's what this is about.

1658
01:43:59,412 --> 01:44:00,711
That's all this is about.

1659
01:44:00,713 --> 01:44:03,481
Oh, how would you know
what this is about?

1660
01:44:03,482 --> 01:44:05,255
You haven't been here
from the beginning,

1661
01:44:05,256 --> 01:44:08,622
worrying every minute of every day
that the decisions you're making

1662
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:11,677
are gonna shape the people
that they are going to be.

1663
01:44:11,678 --> 01:44:15,544
And you are not what
I want my children to be.

1664
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,396
I don't want that either.

1665
01:44:23,524 --> 01:44:28,288
But this isn't about me or you.
It's about them.

1666
01:44:28,289 --> 01:44:32,191
And believe it or not,
I am trying.

1667
01:44:33,164 --> 01:44:39,366
And I do have their very
best interests at heart.

1668
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:12,726
- Would you like a drink?
- Patron, please, double.

1669
01:46:14,539 --> 01:46:16,306
What's up?

1670
01:46:24,115 --> 01:46:26,917
Last year, I lost Ben.

1671
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:30,945
- What?
- In the supermarket.

1672
01:46:33,249 --> 01:46:34,999
You're lying.

1673
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,077
It's true.

1674
01:46:37,078 --> 01:46:41,960
That's impossible. You could never
lose that kid for one second.

1675
01:46:44,906 --> 01:46:46,173
I did.

1676
01:46:47,797 --> 01:46:50,198
Ben never mentioned it.

1677
01:46:50,687 --> 01:46:53,722
He just remembers I found him.

1678
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:57,359
Why didn't you tell me?

1679
01:47:00,101 --> 01:47:02,002
You know why.

1680
01:47:08,898 --> 01:47:11,733
I never wanted to be a mom.

1681
01:47:14,603 --> 01:47:17,804
Well, sharing it
with you is one thing.

1682
01:47:19,406 --> 01:47:21,389
Carrying it alone
the rest of my life...

1683
01:47:24,008 --> 01:47:26,943
Always being compared to you.

1684
01:47:27,664 --> 01:47:30,218
You're perfect.

1685
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:33,011
They worship you.

1686
01:47:34,429 --> 01:47:38,710
I just don't want to be looking over
my shoulder every day for 20 years,

1687
01:47:38,711 --> 01:47:41,913
knowing

1688
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:45,339
that someone else
would have done it right,

1689
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:47,591
done it better,

1690
01:47:47,592 --> 01:47:50,193
the way that I can't.

1691
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:53,882
What do I have that you don't?

1692
01:47:55,022 --> 01:47:57,802
You're Mother Earth incarnate.

1693
01:47:57,803 --> 01:48:01,238
You're hip and fresh.

1694
01:48:01,372 --> 01:48:04,508
- You ride with Anna.
- You'll learn.

1695
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:12,536
You know every story,

1696
01:48:12,537 --> 01:48:15,453
every wound,

1697
01:48:15,454 --> 01:48:17,421
every memory.

1698
01:48:20,102 --> 01:48:24,750
Their whole life's happiness
is wrapped up in you.

1699
01:48:24,751 --> 01:48:27,786
Every single moment.

1700
01:48:30,749 --> 01:48:33,118
Don't you get it?

1701
01:48:34,874 --> 01:48:38,476
Look down the road
to her wedding.

1702
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:45,751
I'm in a room alone with her,

1703
01:48:49,218 --> 01:48:51,320
fitting her veil,

1704
01:48:52,655 --> 01:48:55,057
fluffing her dress,

1705
01:48:56,202 --> 01:48:58,467
telling her,

1706
01:48:58,468 --> 01:49:02,203
"No woman has ever
looked that beautiful."

1707
01:49:11,249 --> 01:49:14,351
And my fear is

1708
01:49:15,253 --> 01:49:17,821
that she'll be thinking,

1709
01:49:21,686 --> 01:49:24,421
"I wish my mom was here."

1710
01:49:27,663 --> 01:49:30,264
And mine is

1711
01:49:30,266 --> 01:49:32,764
she won't.

1712
01:49:38,093 --> 01:49:40,828
But the truth is

1713
01:49:41,225 --> 01:49:43,959
she doesn't have to choose.

1714
01:49:45,077 --> 01:49:47,946
She can have us both,

1715
01:49:48,741 --> 01:49:51,209
love us both.

1716
01:49:52,468 --> 01:49:56,237
And she will be a better
person because of me

1717
01:49:56,874 --> 01:49:59,209
and because of you.

1718
01:50:02,225 --> 01:50:04,260
I have their past,

1719
01:50:07,116 --> 01:50:10,017
and you can have their future.

1720
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:31,896
BEN: Hey, guys,
it's Christmas!

1721
01:50:31,897 --> 01:50:32,827
Wake up!

1722
01:50:32,828 --> 01:50:35,819
I hope there's a white dove.
I hope there's a white dove.

1723
01:50:36,014 --> 01:50:38,795
I hope there's a white dove.
I hope there's a white dove.

1724
01:50:38,796 --> 01:50:40,796
There's gotta be a white dove.

1725
01:50:40,798 --> 01:50:44,014
Hark, I hear the gentle
sounds of Benjamin.

1726
01:50:45,999 --> 01:50:50,163
We'd better get out there before he
starts ripping open all the presents.

1727
01:50:52,266 --> 01:50:56,803
LUKE: Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben,
have a little patience.

1728
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:59,784
Can I open my presents now?

1729
01:51:00,336 --> 01:51:03,601
Um, actually, your mom wants
you guys to go upstairs

1730
01:51:03,602 --> 01:51:08,287
and open presents with her first. And
then we'll open presents down here, okay?

1731
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,555
Hmm, okay.

1732
01:51:10,557 --> 01:51:12,457
Me first.

1733
01:51:32,991 --> 01:51:35,025
Merry Christmas.

1734
01:51:35,796 --> 01:51:39,506
Sweetie, I think this
has your name on it.

1735
01:51:50,452 --> 01:51:54,224
Wow, a real magician's cape!

1736
01:51:54,225 --> 01:51:56,291
- Awesome!
- Whoa.

1737
01:51:57,061 --> 01:51:59,279
Here. Come here,
I'll help you with it.

1738
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,795
What does it have all over it?
Could you see?

1739
01:52:01,796 --> 01:52:03,568
Pictures of me and you.

1740
01:52:03,569 --> 01:52:06,326
And this one right here?
See that one?

1741
01:52:06,327 --> 01:52:09,803
That's our first official photo
of you and me as a couple.

1742
01:52:09,804 --> 01:52:10,990
See that?

1743
01:52:10,991 --> 01:52:13,756
Did you know I was
good-looking right away?

1744
01:52:13,757 --> 01:52:17,459
Everybody in the whole hospital was
talking about it. Are you kidding?

1745
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:21,241
But this good-looking
was beyond my imagination.

1746
01:52:25,968 --> 01:52:27,936
Are you dying?

1747
01:52:33,444 --> 01:52:35,514
What do you think?

1748
01:52:35,515 --> 01:52:37,474
Yes.

1749
01:52:37,475 --> 01:52:40,609
Then I won't see you anymore.

1750
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:44,707
Well, you won't
see my body, but...

1751
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:49,311
You know how a caterpillar
becomes something else?

1752
01:52:51,093 --> 01:52:53,394
- A butterfly.
- Yeah.

1753
01:52:53,528 --> 01:52:56,797
You just have to
think of me as, um,

1754
01:52:57,225 --> 01:52:59,834
off flying somewhere, hmm?

1755
01:52:59,835 --> 01:53:02,802
And, of course, the magician

1756
01:53:02,999 --> 01:53:04,899
knows the secret,

1757
01:53:05,288 --> 01:53:08,116
that just because you
don't see something,

1758
01:53:09,061 --> 01:53:11,889
doesn't mean it's not there.

1759
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:18,276
So even though it might
seem like I'm gone,

1760
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:21,369
the magician knows better.

1761
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:25,185
So where will you be?

1762
01:53:29,855 --> 01:53:31,338
Right here.

1763
01:53:31,339 --> 01:53:35,354
Right here,
inside the magician.

1764
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:38,267
Can I talk to you
when you're there?

1765
01:53:38,269 --> 01:53:40,776
Always.
Always, always.

1766
01:53:40,777 --> 01:53:44,979
You won't hear my voice,
but deep inside,

1767
01:53:45,558 --> 01:53:48,860
you'll know what I'm saying.

1768
01:53:50,424 --> 01:53:52,079
It's just not good enough.

1769
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,556
No.

1770
01:53:53,557 --> 01:53:58,423
No, of course it isn't,
because it isn't everything.

1771
01:53:58,424 --> 01:54:02,306
And we want everything,
don't we? Yeah.

1772
01:54:04,408 --> 01:54:06,775
But we still have one thing,

1773
01:54:06,776 --> 01:54:09,993
one of our greatest things
we're gonna always have.

1774
01:54:09,994 --> 01:54:12,361
You know what that is?

1775
01:54:12,814 --> 01:54:15,383
Our dreams.

1776
01:54:15,384 --> 01:54:18,813
We can still meet
in our dreams.

1777
01:54:18,814 --> 01:54:21,040
We can talk
to each other there,

1778
01:54:21,728 --> 01:54:26,257
and go for walks together in
the summer and in the winter

1779
01:54:26,258 --> 01:54:29,140
and in the rain and the sun.

1780
01:54:29,141 --> 01:54:32,749
I can come and pick you up
and we can go flying.

1781
01:54:37,156 --> 01:54:39,155
Nobody loves you like I do.

1782
01:54:39,156 --> 01:54:40,623
No.

1783
01:54:41,383 --> 01:54:43,484
Nobody ever will.

1784
01:54:55,141 --> 01:54:57,507
Hi, I brought you some tea.

1785
01:54:57,508 --> 01:54:59,147
Oh, merry Christmas, baby.

1786
01:54:59,148 --> 01:55:01,616
Merry Christmas.

1787
01:55:01,617 --> 01:55:03,171
Look what Mom made me.

1788
01:55:03,172 --> 01:55:05,640
Wow!

1789
01:55:05,641 --> 01:55:08,061
I'm gonna show Dad and Isabel.

1790
01:55:08,062 --> 01:55:10,562
- Here.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

1791
01:55:11,187 --> 01:55:12,843
Oh, Mom,

1792
01:55:12,844 --> 01:55:15,530
will you make sure Dad knows how
to double-knot my sneakers,

1793
01:55:15,531 --> 01:55:18,671
the way you do for school
in the morning?

1794
01:55:18,672 --> 01:55:20,561
Yes.

1795
01:55:20,562 --> 01:55:22,495
Thanks.

1796
01:55:25,601 --> 01:55:27,736
That's yours.

1797
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:35,869
Oh, wow!

1798
01:55:36,918 --> 01:55:38,919
- It's a quilt.
- Mm-hmm.

1799
01:55:38,921 --> 01:55:40,323
And it has our pictures on it.

1800
01:55:40,324 --> 01:55:42,457
Here, put it here.

1801
01:55:44,559 --> 01:55:45,480
Whoa.

1802
01:55:46,598 --> 01:55:49,839
It's kind of like a scrapbook
you can keep warm with.

1803
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,409
ANNA: It's so beautiful. I've
never seen anything like it.

1804
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:55,677
See your horse here and
your medals that you got.

1805
01:55:56,418 --> 01:56:00,698
Remember this? That was that dress you
wouldn't take off in pre-K for three weeks.

1806
01:56:00,699 --> 01:56:02,323
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

1807
01:56:02,324 --> 01:56:05,258
Your first step.
Look at your foot.

1808
01:56:05,856 --> 01:56:10,659
Look at that little chubby-cheeked thing.
Look at you.

1809
01:56:14,509 --> 01:56:16,477
Are you scared?

1810
01:56:17,462 --> 01:56:19,130
A little.

1811
01:56:19,986 --> 01:56:22,282
Mostly I was scared for you,

1812
01:56:22,283 --> 01:56:27,251
but I'm not anymore, because
I know you're gonna be okay.

1813
01:56:29,986 --> 01:56:32,626
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1814
01:56:32,627 --> 01:56:35,928
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

1815
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:37,533
Oh, sweetie.

1816
01:56:37,534 --> 01:56:39,165
Oh, my sweetie.

1817
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:41,258
It's okay.

1818
01:56:41,259 --> 01:56:42,751
It's okay to miss me.

1819
01:56:42,752 --> 01:56:44,585
It's okay.

1820
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:49,470
You can miss me and
you can take me with you.

1821
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:51,478
You can.

1822
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:55,663
I mean, when you're
in trouble, have me there.

1823
01:56:55,664 --> 01:56:58,937
When you fall in love,
have me there.

1824
01:56:58,938 --> 01:57:00,648
You can.

1825
01:57:00,649 --> 01:57:04,351
I mean, that's how... That's how
people go on forever, you know,

1826
01:57:04,352 --> 01:57:07,476
because somebody
takes them along.

1827
01:57:07,477 --> 01:57:09,641
Hmm? On your graduation

1828
01:57:09,642 --> 01:57:14,320
and your wedding and when
you have your babies.

1829
01:57:16,805 --> 01:57:19,572
Take me along, will you?

1830
01:57:20,305 --> 01:57:22,806
Always, always and always.

1831
01:57:27,851 --> 01:57:30,452
You have made my life

1832
01:57:30,453 --> 01:57:32,453
so wonderful.

1833
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:36,022
Take that with you, too, okay?

1834
01:57:36,023 --> 01:57:37,689
Okay.

1835
01:57:53,008 --> 01:57:56,671
ANNA: Wow, Mom,
it's so cool!

1836
01:57:56,672 --> 01:57:58,811
ISABEL: Let's see what
you got there, Ben.

1837
01:57:58,812 --> 01:58:00,687
BEN: I don't know.

1838
01:58:07,375 --> 01:58:10,311
What's the matter, honey?
You look a little disappointed.

1839
01:58:10,312 --> 01:58:11,404
Huh?

1840
01:58:11,405 --> 01:58:14,139
No. Everything's great, Mom.

1841
01:58:14,141 --> 01:58:14,990
Uh-huh.

1842
01:58:14,991 --> 01:58:16,630
BEN: I love my presents.

1843
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:20,966
Hey, guys, it looks
like we forgot one.

1844
01:58:23,045 --> 01:58:25,654
It's got your name
on it, buddy.

1845
01:58:25,655 --> 01:58:27,107
Abracadabra!

1846
01:58:28,453 --> 01:58:30,326
What a beautiful cage.

1847
01:58:30,327 --> 01:58:31,693
Yeah.

1848
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:34,837
It's empty.

1849
01:58:36,225 --> 01:58:38,826
Well, let's try it again.

1850
01:58:39,866 --> 01:58:43,982
I think maybe this time you
should say the magic words.

1851
01:58:44,553 --> 01:58:47,169
Abracadabra!
Allakazam!

1852
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:49,971
Allakazoom!
Boom!

1853
01:58:50,866 --> 01:58:53,368
- JACKIE: Oh, my!
- It worked!

1854
01:59:27,163 --> 01:59:31,341
Why doesn't everybody get on
the sofa for a picture, huh?

1855
01:59:31,342 --> 01:59:34,857
Baby, can you put that
birdcage on the floor for me?

1856
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:40,849
And I'll set up here.

1857
01:59:45,233 --> 01:59:47,240
All right.
There you go.

1858
01:59:47,241 --> 01:59:50,794
On the count of three, I want
to see big Christmas smiles.

1859
01:59:50,795 --> 01:59:53,095
One, two...

1860
01:59:53,811 --> 01:59:55,445
Benjamin.

1861
01:59:55,447 --> 01:59:57,181
Three.

1862
01:59:57,491 --> 01:59:59,655
Excellent.

1863
01:59:59,656 --> 02:00:02,388
Good one. Okay, now let's get
one with the whole family.

1864
02:00:02,389 --> 02:00:03,855
Isabel?

1865
02:00:10,295 --> 02:00:14,499
Okay, let me just reset this.

1866
02:00:17,514 --> 02:00:18,514
