Created By Khaled-Klz.

00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,406
This is Zero One Alpha.
We have secured Falcon.

3
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,613
I say again,
we have secured Falcon.

4
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,246
By the time I count to ten...

5
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,549
you will have told me
exactly what I need to know.

6
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:51,956
If not...

7
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,050
the number ten will be the
last thing you will ever hear.

8
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,091
One

9
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,055

00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:58,726

11
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,226
Four

12
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,631

00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,665

00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,799
Seven

00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:04,558
Eight

16
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,400
Grenade!
Sir, get back!

17
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,084
Shit.

18
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,281
Fucking missed it.

19
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,918
How did I fucking miss it?

20
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:32,692
Merlin, I apologize for putting
you in this position.

21
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,423
You trained him well.

22
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,958
James...

23
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,204
training is over.

24
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,464
Welcome to Kingsman.

25
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,273
Lancelot.

26
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,434
Sir.

27
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,777
I'll deal with this mess personally.

28
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,954
L very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.

29
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,387
I hope you understand.

30
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,053
How can I understand?

31
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,221
You won't tell me anything.

32
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,625
I didn't even know
he wasn't with his squad.

33
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,964
I'm so sorry,
I can't say more.

34
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,470
But I would like to present you
with this Medal of Valor...

35
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,976
and if you look closely on the back,
there's a number.

36
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,837
And as a more concrete gesture
of our gratitude...

37
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,915
we'd like to offer you...

38
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,479
Let's call it a favor.

39
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,144
The nature of it is your choice.

40
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,653
Just tell the operator...

41
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,524
"oxfords not brogues,
and then I'll know it's you.

42
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't want your help!

43
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,098
I want my husband back!

44
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,102
What's your name,
young man?

45
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,540
Eggs?

46
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,109
Hello, Eggsy

47
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,547
Can I see that?

48
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,289
You take care of this, Eggsy.

49
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,690
All right?

50
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,221
And take care of your mum, too.

51
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,735
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

52
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,401
For God's sakes,
just rip it off.

53
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,105
I'm under very strict instructions
not to hurt you.

54
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,512
Look, you've made a mistake.

55
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,449
I'm a university lecturer.
I've got no money.

56
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,088
This isn't about money.

57
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,190
Our boss just wants to talk to you.

58
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,289
Am I meant to find that reassuring?

59
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,587
He'll be here soon,
He'll explain.

60
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,356
Do you like whiskey?

61
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,763
Red, get the '62 Dalmore.

62
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,129
Honestly,
this whiskey, it's amazing.

63
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,270
You will shit.

64
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,957
I suppose asking to borrow
a cup of sugar is a step too far?

65
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,813
Professor Arnold,
I'm hereto take you home.

66
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,433
1962 Dalmore.

67
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,702
It'd be a sin to spill any.

68
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,839
Don't you think?

69
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,717
Can you hold these?
Please?

70
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,898
Thank you.

71
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,574
Everything is clean.

72
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:52,079
My kind of welcome.

73
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,585
No stomach for violence.

74
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,659
L mean, literally,
I see one drop of blood...

75
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,763
that is me done.

76
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,091
I'm like...

77
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,596
projectile.

78
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,928
Listen, I'm so sorry...

79
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:16,473
you had to witness all this unpleasantness
due to our uninvited guest.

80
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,771
But I promise you, by the time
I've found out who he works for...

81
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:25,280
you and I will be the best of friends.

82
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,882
To the shop, please.

83
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,375
Arthur's in the dining room, sir.

84
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,020
Arthur.

85
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,388
Galahad.

86
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,259
The others were beginning to wonder
if we were going to have a double toast.

87
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,940
Gentlemen, I'm thankful to
say it's been 17 years...

88
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,508
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

89
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:30,781
Lancelot was an outstanding agent,
and a true Kingsman.

90
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,382
He will be sorely missed.

91
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,912
To Lancelot.

92
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,415
To Lancelot.

93
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:46,454
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelots replacement tomorrow.

94
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,199
I want each of you
to propose a candidate...

95
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,699
and have them report to UK HQ...

96
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,030
no later than 9 p.m. GMT.

97
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,469
Thank you.

98
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,873
Merlin.

99
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,537
Come in.

100
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,574
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries...

101
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,445
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

102
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,608
Glasses, gentlemen, please.

103
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,621
Uganda' 2012.

104
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,282
Synthetic cathinones.

105
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,895
They put it in the water supply
of a guerrilla army base.

106
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:22,295
Rage, cannibalism,
multiple fatalities.

107
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,125
Chechnya, 2013.

108
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,096
Insurgents turned on one another.

109
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,003
Indisputably, the work of our mercenaries,
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

110
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,268
So what happened to Lancelot?

111
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,270
He tracked them to this property
in Argentina.

112
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,777
While he had them
under surveillance...

113
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,780
he became aware
they'd effected a kidnapping.

114
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:44,612
So he executed a solo rescue mission,
which failed.

115
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,980
This is his last transmission.

116
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,519
- Who is he?
- Some climate change doomsayer.

117
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,186
Expounds something
called "Gaia theory...

118
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,128
about the world healing itself,
or some such.

119
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:59,168
But what's curious,
is he's not actually missing.

120
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,970
This is Professor Arnold...

121
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,165
at Imperial College this morning.

122
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,006
It's all yours.

123
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,476
And don't forget
your membership proposal.

124
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,708
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time.

125
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,783
17 years and still...

126
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,548
evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

127
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,816
Need I remind you, l wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man?

128
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,552
He was as much Kingsman
material as any of them.

129
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,957
More so.

130
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,123
But he wasn't exactly
one of us, was he?

131
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,496
Let's face it, Galahad,
your little experiment failed.

132
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,698
With respect, Arthur,
you're a snob.

133
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,968
"With respect?

134
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,339
The world is changing.

135
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:46,507
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

136
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:05,999
Eggsy?

137
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,201
Eggsy, come here.

138
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,206
- Got any Rizla, babe?
- No.

139
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,405
Why don't you do your mum a favor,
go down to the shop and get some?

140
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,878
- Get them yourself.
- Oi.

141
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,712
What have I said to you
about speaking to Dean like that?

142
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,344
Three's a crowd, innit?
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

143
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,956
I'll tell you what.

144
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,888
Why don't you take this,
go and get some Rizlas...

145
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,891
get yourself some sweets?
And while you're gone...

146
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,955
we'll show your mother
how three can be good company.

147
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,399
Thanks, babe.

148
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,973
There we go.

149
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,140
Is that better?

150
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,329
If Dean treats your mum so bad,
why doesn't she leave him?

151
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,467
Low self-esteem,
That's her problem.

152
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,397
Fuck off.
Why would she have low self-esteem?

153
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,400
Eggsy's mum is well fit.

154
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,899
- No offense' bruv.
- lt's all right.

155
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,140
One of these days,
I'm gonna smash his face in.

156
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,744
Are you mental, cause?

157
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,574
He'd just get that lot to do you,
and then pretend he knew nothing--

158
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:26,948
about it it.

159
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,783
You think you can chat shit about us
and we won't do nothing...

160
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,081
just because our guvnor's
banging Eggsy's mum?

161
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,088
Pretty much, yeah.

162
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,420
Bruv, just leave it,
Let's just go, man.

163
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,492
It's not worth it.

164
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,256
You boys have outstayed your welcome.

165
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,428
Leave.

166
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,324
What?

167
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,934
I'm sorry about that, bruv.

168
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,804
Yeah.

169
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,132
Mug.

170
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,440
They weren't fucking worth it, boys.

171
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,781
It's freezing,
Why are we walking?

172
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,783
You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv?

173
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,445
Yeah. Now,
we're gonna nick his car.

174
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,453
Shit!

175
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,821
Hold on, boys.

176
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,030
Hey, that's my fucking car!

177
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,468
Hey! Hey! Eggsy!

178
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,664
I swear, you want to fucking stop it!

179
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,367
You're a fucking dead man!
Stop it!

180
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,303
I'm gonna fucking have ya!

181
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,977
Floor n, Eggsy!

182
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:37,985
Floor it!

183
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,085
Wanker!

184
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,416
Yeah, Dean,
Look, it's me.

185
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,585
Eggsy just stole my fucking car.

186
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,596
I've come out the pub,
he's done 15 donuts in my fucking face...

187
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,325
and he's drove off.

188
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,595
No, I can't have it!
He's disrespecting me.

189
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,000
And that means,
he's disrespecting you.

190
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,005
Hold up!
What them?

191
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,713
Dickhead.

192
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,652
Foxes are vermin, cause.

193
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,255
Should've driven it over.

194
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,391
Should've done a lot of things.

195
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,220
I'll sort this,
Get out of the car.

196
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,896
I said, get out of the fucking car!

197
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,839
Eggsy, there is no such thing
as honor amongst thieves.

198
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,574
Now, you can start giving me some names
of the boys you were with...

199
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,578
or you go down.

200
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,780
It's up to you.

201
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,577
I want to exercise
my right to a phone call.

202
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,791
Well, I hope it's to your mum...

203
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:25,452
to tell her you're gonna be
18 months late for your dinner.

204
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,794
Customer Complaints,
how may I help you'?

205
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,122
My name's Eggsy Unwin.

206
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,793
Sorry, Gary Unwin.
And I'm up shit creek.

207
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,198
I'm in Holborn police station...

208
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,033
and my mum said to call this number
if ever I needed help.

209
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,698
I'm sorry, sir,
Wrong number.

210
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,207
Wait! Wait!

211
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,212
Oxfords not brogues.

212
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,348
Your complaint has been duly noted...

213
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,646
and we hope that we have
not lost you as a loyal customer.

214
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,057
Yeah.

215
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,000
You what?

216
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,833
Yeah.

217
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,169
Yes, I totally understand.

218
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,757
Eggs?

219
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,891
Would you like a lift home?

220
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,859
Who are you?

221
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,366
The man who got you released.

222
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,868
That ain't an answer.

223
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,366
A little gratitude would be nice.

224
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,867
My name is Harry Han,
and I gave you that medal.

225
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,403
Your father saved my life.

226
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,812
So before you was a tailor,
was you in the army?

227
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,719
Like an officer.

228
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,379
Not quite.

229
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,321
So where was you posted,
Iraq or something?

230
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,757
Sorry, Eggsy,
Classified.

231
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,388
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

232
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,924
The day your father died,
I missed something.

233
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,162
And if it weren't for his courage...

234
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,273
my mistake would have cost the lives
of every man present.

235
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,673
So I owe him.

236
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,913
Your father was a brave man.

237
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,912
A good man.

238
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,106
And having read your files...

239
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,684
I think he'd be bitterly disappointed
in the choices you've made.

240
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,014
You can't talk to me like that.

241
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,086
Huge l Q.

242
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,121
Great performance at primary school.

243
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,357
And it all went tits up.

244
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,257
Drugs, petty crime,
Never had a job.

245
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,091
You think there's a lot of jobs
going around here, do you?

246
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,755
Doesn't explain
why you gave up your hobbies.

247
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,492
First prize,
regional Under-10s gymnastics...

248
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,864
two years in a row.

249
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,267
Your coach had you pegged
as Olympic team material.

250
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,101
Yeah, well, when you grow up around
someone like my step-dad...

251
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,708
you pick up new hobbies pretty quick.

252
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,606
Of course,
Always someone else's fault.

253
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,008
Who's to blame
for you quitting the Marines?

254
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,548
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

255
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,708
Because my mum went mental.

256
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,685
Banging on about losing me
as well as my dad.

257
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,290
Didn't want me being cannon fodder
for snobs like you.

258
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,859
Judging people like me
from your ivory towers...

259
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,223
with no thought about
why we do what we do.

260
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,292
We ain't got much choice,
You get me?

261
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,134
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses...

262
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,135
we'd do just as well as you.
If not, better.

263
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,138
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking the piss?

264
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,071
Some more examples of young men...

265
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,974
who simply need a silver suppository?

266
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,637
No, they're exceptions,
Come on.

267
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,249
Nonsense.
We haven't finished our drinks.

268
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,509
After you nicked his car...

269
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:08,981
Dean says you're fair game.

270
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,586
He don't give a shit
what your mum says.

271
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,153
Listen, boys...

272
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,492
I've had a rather emotional day...

273
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,994
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,
and I'm sure it's well-founded...

274
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,821
I'd appreciate it enormously...

275
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,933
if you could just leave us in peace...

276
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,661
until I finish
this lovely pint of Guinness.

277
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,366
You should get out of the way, Granddad,
or you'll get hurt and all.

278
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,008
He ain't joking,
You should go.

279
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,012
Excuse me.

280
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,551
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith street.

281
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,792
Manners...

282
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,294
maketh...

283
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,560
man.

284
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,808
Do you know what that means?

285
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,877
Then let me teach you a lesson.

286
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,753
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

287
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,533
You fucking dirty,
fucking dirty.

288
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,218
Sorry about that.

289
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,150
Needed to let off a little steam.

290
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,815
I heard yesterday a friend of mine died.

291
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,019
He knew your father too, actually.

292
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,658
Now, I do apologize,
Eggsy.

293
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,824
I shouldn't have done this
in front of you.

294
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,993
No, please!
I won't say nothing, I swear!

295
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,661
If there's one thing I can do,
it's keep my mouth shut.

296
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,171
- You won't tell a soul?
- Ask the feds.

297
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,330
I've never grassed anyone up.

298
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,841
- Is that a promise?
- On my life!

299
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,847
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

300
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,747
You're right about the snobs.

301
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,184
But there, too,
there are exceptions.

302
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,886
Best of luck with everything.

303
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:52,437
In celebrity news, the Richmond Valentine
movie premiered in Hollywood last night.

304
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:55,408
The story of the internet billionaires
rise to power...

305
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,377
is expected to be
this award season's hot ticket.

306
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,541
One notable absence from the red carpet
was lggy Azalea...

307
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:05,211
still missing three days after she failed
to appear at her Oakland concert.

308
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,913
No ransom has been demanded.

309
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,059
Eggsy, just go, please,
because he's gonna...

310
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,728
No, please, don't hurt him!

311
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,591
Fuck off!
Get the fuck away with ya!

312
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,958
Shut the fuck up!

313
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,259
Who was with you in that fucking pub?

314
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,562
I want to know the name of the geezer
you was with.

315
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,568
- I wasn't with no one!
- Who was it?

316
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,138
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Who was it?

317
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,433
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

318
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,734
Fucking tell me his name!

319
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,242
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

320
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,439
You listen to me!

321
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,585
I want to know who you was with in that pub.
Do you understand?

322
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,618
I want to know his fucking name!

323
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,757
Because, I swear,
H! rip your head off

324
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,951
- Tell me!
- I don't know what you're fucking on about!

325
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,151
Just tell him, Eggsy!

326
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,126
Fuck off!
Fuck off, Michelle!

327
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,594
I could kill you right now...

328
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,257
and no one in the whole world
will notice!

329
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,096
But I would.

330
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,101
I have enough evidence
on your activities...

331
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,262
to have you locked up
for the rest of your life...

332
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,636
- Mr. Dean Anthony Baker.
- What the fuck?

333
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,436
So I suggest you leave the boy alone...

334
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,173
or! shah' be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.

335
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,708
Eggsy, meet me at the tailor
I told you about.

336
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,354
What the fuck's going on here?

337
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:14,518
Eggsy,
you fucking maggot!

338
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,886
Hey, we got a racer!

339
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,527
Come here, Hey!

340
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,355
Eggsy, you fucking..

341
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,826
Come here, son!

342
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,336
You wanker!

343
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,138
I'll have you, son!

344
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,562
I've never met a tailor before.

345
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,739
But I know you ain't one.

346
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,374
Come with me.

347
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,353
Come on in.

348
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,053
What do you see?

349
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,562
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

350
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,602
I see a young man with potential.

351
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,704
A young man who is loyal.

352
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,572
Who can do as he's asked.

353
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,543
And who wants to do
something good with his life.

354
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,107
Did you see the film Trading Places?

355
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,217
No.

356
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,111
How about Nikita?

357
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,555
Pretty Woman?

358
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,551
All right.

359
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,719
My point is, that the lack of a silver spoon
has set you on a certain path...

360
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:01,728
but you needn't stay on it.

361
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:06,801
If you're prepared to adapt and learn,
you can transform.

362
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,235
Like in My Fair Lady.

363
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,299
Well, you're full of surprises.

364
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,272
Yes, like My Fair Lady.

365
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,612
Only, in this case, I'm offering you
the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

366
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,615
A tailor?

367
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,415
A Kingsman agent.

368
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,251
Like a spy?

369
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:27,583
Of sorts.

370
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,423
Interested?

371
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,256
You think I've got anything to lose?

372
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,768
Since 1849...

373
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:46,103
Kingsman tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

374
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:50,941
By 1919, a great number of them
had lost their heirs to World War One.

375
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,115
That meant a lot of money
going uninherited.

376
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:59,279
And a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

377
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:02,357
Our founders realized that they could
channel that wealth and influence...

378
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,152
for the greater good.

379
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:07,627
And so began our other venture.

380
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,797
An independent,
international intelligence agency...

381
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:14,301
operating at the highest level
of discretion.

382
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,562
Above the politics and bureaucracy...

383
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,904
that undermine the integrity
of government-run spy organizations.

384
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,011
The suit is a modern gentleman's armor.

385
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,908
And the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

386
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,577
How deep does this fucking thing go?

387
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,812
Deep enough.

388
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,196
Shit, we're late.

389
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,385
Your father had the
same look on his face.

390
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,429
As did I.

391
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,226
Come on.

392
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,062
Galahad.

393
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:56,228
My code name.

394
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,840
Late again, sir.

395
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,504
Good luck.

396
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,241
In you go.

397
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,916
Fall in.

398
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Merlin.

399
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,187
You are about to embark...

400
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,094
on what is probably the most
dangerous job interview in the world.

401
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,769
One of you, and only one of you,
will become the next Lancelot.

402
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,771
Can anybody tell me what this is?

403
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,270
- Yes?
- Body bag, sir.

404
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,710
Correct,
Charlie, isn't it?

405
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:38,812
Yes, sir.

406
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,710
Good.

407
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,283
In a moment,
you will each collect a body bag.

408
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,284
You will write your name on that bag.

409
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,852
You will write the details
of your next of kin on that bag.

410
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:51,290
This represents your acknowledgment
of the risks that you are about to face...

411
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,722
as well as your agreement
to strict confidentiality.

412
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,958
Which, incidentally, if you break,
will result in you...

413
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,567
and your next of kin...

414
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,630
being in that bag.

415
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,707
Is that understood?

416
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,371
Excellent.

417
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,241
Fall out.

418
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,988
Roxanne,
But call me Roxy.

419
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,157
- I'm Eggsy.
- Essay?

420
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:23,258
Nov Eggsy

421
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,758
Eggy?

422
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,054
Where did they dig you up?

423
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,323
You know we're not allowed
to discuss who proposed us.

424
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:29,761
No need to bite his head off.

425
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,265
Charlie's only making conversation,
right, Charlie?

426
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,097
I'm Digby.

427
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,065
Dig DY..

428
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,673
Eggy, this is Rufus.

429
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,331
Rufus, Eggy.

430
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,276
So, Eggy,
are you Oxford or Cambridge?

431
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,441
Neither.

432
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:46,912
- Saint Andrews?
- Durham?

433
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,018
No, wait,
I think we may have met.

434
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,712
Did you serve me at the McDonald's
in Winchester service station?

435
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:53,584
No.

436
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,782
It's definitely Saint Andrews.

437
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,554
Just ignore them.

438
00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,787
You need a pen?

439
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:00,725
Cheers.

440
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,297
Amelia, isn't it?

441
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,899
Amelia, Eggs?

442
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,227
Hi, Eggsy.

443
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,298
Don't take any notice of those guys.

444
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,200
That's what I told him.

445
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,703
It's just scare tactics.

446
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,566
Classic army technique.

447
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,901
No one's gonna die.

448
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,244
Shame.

449
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,582
Great. You don't know,
the CIA don't know.

450
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,247
Nobody knows who this guy is?

451
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,981
Fine.

452
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,559
Seriously, it's fine.

453
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:35,596
Well, it's not really fine,
but it's not why I'm here.

454
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:39,224
Hell, man, you know me.
Money's not my issue.

455
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,098
I could've retired
straight out of MIT...

456
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,739
fucked off to some island,
let the business run itself.

457
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,637
Nobody told me
to try and save the planet.

458
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,436
I wanted to.

459
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,309
Climate change research,
lobbying, years of study, billions of dollars...

460
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,280
and you know why I quit?

461
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:59,484
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

462
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,314
Hence, my epiphany.

463
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,257
Money won't solve this.

464
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,097
Those idiots
who call themselves politicians...

465
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:12,292
have buried their heads in the sand
and stood for nothing but re-election.

466
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:17,437
So I spent the last two years
trying to find a real solution.

467
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,942
And I found it.

468
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,139
Now, if you really want to make
the world a better place...

469
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,773
I suggest you open your fucking ears,
because I'm about to tell it to you.

470
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,817
Go on, Mr. Valentine.

471
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,478
I'm still listening.

472
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,158
As long as you agree to all my terms.

473
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,899
All right, no one panic,
Listen to me.

474
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,200
Stay calm.

475
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:29,739
Fuck.

476
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,406
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels!

477
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,683
Loo snorkels?

478
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:35,681
Showerheads!

479
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:37,717
Showerheads?

480
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,355
She's right,
Fucking go!

481
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,749
Hey, hang about,
what's wrong with the fucking door?

482
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,275
Congratulations on completing
your first task.

483
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,176
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

484
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,147
For those of you
who are still confused...

485
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,479
if you can get a breathing tube
around a U-bend of a toilet...

486
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,485
you have an unlimited air supply.

487
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,147
Simple physics, worth remembering.

488
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,624
Eggsy, well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

489
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:26,785
He's probably seen enough of them.

490
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,830
Yeah, you can all wipe those smirks
off your faces.

491
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:33,834
Because as far as I'm concerned,
every single one of you has failed.

492
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,197
You all forgot
the most important thing...

493
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,504
teamwork.

494
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,352
So much for classic army technique.

495
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:00,757
35.

496
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,830
105.

497
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,765
That's it,
That's it.

498
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,032
Hello.

499
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,865
Can I help you?

500
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:16,410
Yes. I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

501
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,009
Really? It's actually quite fascinating.

502
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,547
My colleague died
trying to rescue you...

503
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,416
and I'm sure you saw
how well trained he was...

504
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,184
so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped
you and why they let you go.

505
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,088
I have no idea what you're talking..

506
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,124
I'm not supposed to say it,
but it was..

507
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,226
For God's sake,
I've barely touched you.

508
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,695
Man up!

509
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,454
Fuck that guy, whoever he is.
I'm gonna..

510
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,960
He made me kill Professor Arnold.

511
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,458
I goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

512
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,652
Well, the good news is...

513
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:08,627
we know the emergency
and surveillance system work.

514
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,767
You know what's not good news?

515
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:12,629
"My colleague died!

516
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,236
That's what he said!

517
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,736
This is an organization,
and they're all over us.

518
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,736
- Whoever you spoke to..
- I told you...

519
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:22,435
I made contact with the KGB, MIG,
Mossad and Beijing.

520
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,011
They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.

521
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,743
Beijing.

522
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:30,415
So freaky how there's no recognizable name
for the Chinese secret service.

523
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,015
Now, that's what you call
a secret, right?

524
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,787
You know what?
Fuck it.

525
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,817
We need to speed things up.

526
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,325
Bring the product release forward.

527
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,327
We're only halfway into production...

528
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,931
and speeding it will cost a fortune.

529
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,361
Do I look like I give a fuck?

530
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,465
Just get it done.

531
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,531
As some of you will
have learned last night...

532
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:56,173
teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

533
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:00,146
We're hereto enhance your skills,
test you to the limit.

534
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:03,718
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

535
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,718
Wherever you go,
your dog goes.

536
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,118
You will care for it,
You will teach it.

537
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,317
And by the time it's fully trained,
so will you be.

538
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,053
Those of you who are still here,
that is.

539
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,165
Do you understand?

540
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,231
Choose your puppy.

541
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,064
A poodle?

542
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,069
What?

543
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,898
They're gun dogs.

544
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,565
Oldest working breed.

545
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,540
Easy to train.

546
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,841
A pug?

547
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,876
It's a bulldog, innit?

548
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,684
It'll get bigger,
though, won't it?

549
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,718
Shit.

550
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:49,062
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

551
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,201
No direct brain trauma at all.

552
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,594
How much longer can he be out?

553
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,931
That's the million-dollar question.

554
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,937
We don't know
what he was exposed to in there.

555
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,575
What about Harry's footage?

556
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,404
It didn't stream to his home terminal.

557
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,547
Encrypted and uncrackable.

558
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,907
If and when he comes around...

559
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,710
you might want to have a word with him
about sharing his password.

560
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,546
Is he gonna be all right?

561
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,382
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

562
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,121
But there's hope, okay?

563
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,420
If I were you,
I'd concentrate on your training.

564
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,755
Make it through the tests.
Make him proud.

565
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,894
Come on, come on, come on!

566
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,131
J.B, come on!
Come on!

567
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,234
I'm not coming last because of you.

568
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,571
J.B., I'll shoot you!
Goddamn you, I'll fucking shoot you!

569
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,478
Merlin said we're not
allowed to hold you.

570
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,144
Bollocks.

571
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:29,664
Water!

572
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,459
- Come on, then!
- Eggsy, forget it!

573
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,127
What's wrong, mate?
You can't take a joke?

574
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,467
Seriously, you'll get thrown out,
and it's just not worth it.

575
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,131
Maybe I don't give a fuck
if I get kicked out!

576
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,641
Do it. Come on,
you pleb.

577
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,210
Charlie, fuck off!

578
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,317
Yeah, go on, walk away,
Dickhead.

579
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,710
Come on, J.B.

580
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,979
Come on, good boy.

581
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,168
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test...

582
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,862
starting now.

583
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:13,704
New target, 800 meters.

584
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,503
You know, it's unbelievable.
You're still here...

585
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,170
lingering like some
big, steaming shit that just won't flush.

586
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,839
Roger that,
Target identified.

587
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,007
And how about you shut the fuck up?

588
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,312
Positive discrimination...

589
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,886
that's what it is.

590
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,218
It's like those fucking state school kids
who get into Oxford on C grades...

591
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,018
because their mum
is a one-legged lesbian.

592
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,684
You don't know fuck all about my grades.

593
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,727
Forgive me,
I'm sure you're highly educated.

594
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,365
Fire when ready.

595
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:40,525
How's that for positive discrimination?

596
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,013
I want to thank you both
for listening...

597
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:58,245
and I really, really appreciate
you travelling all this way...

598
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,410
Your Royal Highness.

599
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,382
And you, too, Prime Minister.

600
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:04,550
I think this is quite brilliant.

601
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,552
It's absolutely brilliant.

602
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,196
You are completely crazy.

603
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,760
And as for you,
Prime Minister

604
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,099
I'm speechless you'd even consider this.

605
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,381
- Don't touch..
- Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

606
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,571
But you've got a big role to play...

607
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,274
in getting the Scandinavian
region back on track.

608
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,950
You're popular, inspirational...

609
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,589
and you have the power
to galvanize the people.

610
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,588
Now,
whether you're on board or not...

611
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,385
I'm going to have to insist...

612
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,428
on getting you somewhere
I can ensure your safety.

613
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,126
How about you, Prime Minister?
You in or out?

614
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,591
Well, I think it's about time...

615
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:51,433
that a politician did something
that actually made a difference.

616
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,772
Too true.

617
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:54,773
What?

618
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,275
Take her away.

619
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:00,779
Drink?

620
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,274
Why not?

621
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,156
Guards! Help!

622
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:07,985
Don't worry.

623
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,625
No harm will come to the princess.

624
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:14,256
Well, I'm a republican anyways,
so it really doesn't matter.

625
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:16,594
Release the princess!

626
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:51,660
Okay, you're done.

627
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,324
Not so bad, right?

628
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,701
Hardly felt a thing.

629
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,495
Welcome aboard.

630
00:44:57,962 --> 00:44:59,805
Pleasure is all mine.

631
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,138
Ever heard of knocking?

632
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,682
Only when I'm casing a place to rob.

633
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,347
Merlin said you wanted to see me?

634
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,681
I hope J.B.'s training
is going as well as yours is.

635
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,015
Sit.

636
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:22,396
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

637
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,056
Your test results were even better
than I could've hoped.

638
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:28,864
Come in.

639
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,704
Eggsy, I need to have
a private conversation.

640
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:36,844
You're dismissed.

641
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,708
Nonsense,
Let him observe.

642
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,541
Might learn a thing or two.

643
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,040
As you wish,
Take a look at this.

644
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,016
For Gods sake,
We barely touched you.

645
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:46,018
Man up!

646
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,384
Fucking hell!

647
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,526
That is rank, Harry.

648
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,558
You blew up his head?

649
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,196
It's a bit much, innit?

650
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:58,027
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

651
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,724
Here, under the scar.

652
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,560
Did my hardware
pick up the signal that triggered it?

653
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,229
Fortunately, yes.

654
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,542
Unfortunately,
the IP address I traced it to...

655
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,904
is registered
to the Valentine Corporation.

656
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,910
That's not much of a lead.
He has millions of employees worldwide.

657
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,242
That Richmond Valentine is a genius.

658
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,048
Did you not see his announcement today?

659
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:21,917
No.

660
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,557
We each spend on average
$2,000 a year...

661
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,597
on cell phone and internet usage.

662
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:34,896
It gives me great pleasure
to announce...

663
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,596
those days are oven.

664
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:38,797
As of tomorrow...

665
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,809
every man, woman and child
can claim a free SIM card...

666
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:47,109
compatible with any cell phone,
any computer...

667
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:51,447
and utilize my communications network
or free.

668
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:52,952
Free calls...

669
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,612
free internet...

670
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,281
for everyone.

671
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,624
Forever.

672
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,139
Valentine's assistant
has the same implant scar.

673
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,309
I think Mr. Valentine and I
should have a téte-é-téte.

674
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,288
He's having a gala dinner next week.

675
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:29,288
I'll get you an invitation.
You need to be careful, though.

676
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,460
Since you've been out,
hundreds of VIPs have gone missing.

677
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,993
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

678
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,027
Then I suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping.

679
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,007
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

680
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,341
What, don't like heights?

681
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,505
Yeah, ifs okay.

682
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,346
I've done it before, which is probably why,
come to think of it.

683
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,520
Hey, ifs gonna be ail right.

684
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,158
You're top of the class.

685
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:06,355
Listen up.

686
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:09,327
Your mission is to land in the target
without the radar detecting you.

687
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:13,162
If I read you on the radar,
or you miss the target, you go home.

688
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:14,696
Is that understood?

689
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,835
Drop zone coming up, 20 seconds.

690
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,577
We gotta go.

691
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,720
Eggsy, I really don't think
I can do this.

692
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:35,880
Of course you can?

693
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,389
Head to the back
and I'll show you how, yeah?

694
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,892
Eggsy, wait!
Hang on!

695
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,395
Roxy, just stop fucking about!

696
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:52,905
Follow me, yeah?

697
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,920
Come on!

698
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,251
Roxy, it's now or never.

699
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:14,757
Jump!

700
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:34,747
Good girl, Rox...

701
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,475
Fm glad you made it!

702
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,959
Yeah!

703
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:52,623
Come on!

704
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,131
My, my,
you're all very cheerful.

705
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,467
Did you really think it was gonna be
that straightforward'?

706
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,008
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

707
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,841
A Kingsman agent needs to be able
to solve problems under pressure.

708
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:09,941
Like what to do when one of
your group has no parachute.

709
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,981
- What, no parachute?
- Shit!

710
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,482
Who?

711
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:15,487
Fuck!

712
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:16,624
Which one?

713
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,191
What do we do?

714
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,794
I told you,
Aim for the target.

715
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,190
Come in under the radar.

716
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,332
And I hope not to be scraping
one of you up.

717
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,668
But if I do have to,
and you're inside the target...

718
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,864
please know I'll be very impressed.

719
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,471
- Fuck!
- Oh, Shit!

720
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,004
Everybody listen,
We got a plan!

721
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,682
Pair off!
Grab the closest person to them.

722
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,512
Rufus, come on!

723
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,652
Fuck!

724
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,386
Rufus!

725
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,017
Shit! I can't!

726
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,521
Fuck!

727
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,023
Thank God!

728
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,029
Rufus, you wanker!

729
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,668
Shit, we're an odd number now!

730
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,829
Quick, make a circle!

731
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,700
Fuck, he's right!
Boys, let's do it.

732
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,505
We puff our cords one by one!

733
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,875
When we know who's fucked...

734
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:14,380
the person on their right grabs them.

735
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,413
Okay, Eggys.

736
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:18,876
Good plan, Eggsy.

737
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:21,216
You have 30 seconds.
Come on now, hurry.

738
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,379
Me first!

739
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:25,724
Fuck!

740
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,226
Yes!

741
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,699
Okay, me next.

742
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,227
See you on the ground, boys.

743
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,064
Now me.

744
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,776
Fuck!

745
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,214
Roxy.

746
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,047
no matter what happens now,
I've got you, all right?

747
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,221
Okay, Eggsy.

748
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:58,553
- Yours first, okay?
- Yep.

749
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:12,605
Shit!

750
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:21,644
Shit!

751
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:24,445
Shit!

752
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,114
Rex!

753
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:31,984
Fuck.

754
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,505
Hugo, Digby.

755
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,478
You don't land in the K,
you're not in the K.

756
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,981
Rufus, you opened too soon.

757
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,483
You were all over the radar.

758
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,484
All three of you,
pack your bags, go home.

759
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,819
Eggsy, Roxy,
congratulations.

760
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:05,786
You set a new record.

761
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,155
Opening at 300 feet...

762
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,352
that's pretty ballsy.

763
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,022
Well done for completing another task.
Fall out.

764
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:13,157
Sorry, sir.

765
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,996
But why the fuck did you
choose me as the gimp?

766
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,365
Am I the expendable candidate?

767
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,133
No, no, no.
You don't talk to me like that.

768
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,503
You have a complaint, you come here
and you whisper it in my ear.

769
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,046
You need to take
that chip off your shoulder.

770
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,542
Mr. Devere.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

771
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,883
I'm awfully sorry.
I seem to have my dates muddled up.

772
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,924
No, no, no.
I cancelled the gala because of you.

773
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,057
Anybody willing to donate that much...

774
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,390
deserves their own dinner.
Come in!

775
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,021
Thank you.

776
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,393
Got to admit,
I was really intrigued to meet you.

777
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,402
There aren't many billionaires
I don't know.

778
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,562
I don't doubt it.

779
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,733
And, obviously,
I had my people look into your affairs...

780
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,606
and that's some pretty old money
you're from.

781
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,610
How'd your folks make it?

782
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:35,240
Property, mostly.
Property and the markets.

783
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,442
Nothing questionable,
if that's your concern.

784
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:40,384
Look, I'm just into finding out
what caliber person you are.

785
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:41,386
I'm sure you understand that.

786
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:42,947
I most certainly do.

787
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,615
- Hope you're hungry.
- I'm famished.

788
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,817
Good.

789
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:46,917
Grab a seat.

790
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:09,776
I'll have the Big Mac, please.

791
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,112
Great choice.

792
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:14,688
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

793
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,654
Goes great with this '45 Lafite.

794
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:17,815
A classic pairing.

795
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,252
And may I suggest Twinkies
and a 1937 Chéteau D'yquem for pudding?

796
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,462
I like it.

797
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:27,833
So, you want to
donate to my foundation.

798
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,336
You are aware that I wound things
down in that area, right?

799
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,442
Climate change is a threat,
which affects us all, Mr. Valentine.

800
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:37,704
And you're one of the few powerful men
who seems to share my concerns.

801
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:40,542
No, I shut things down,
because I wasn't getting anywhere.

802
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,548
Every bit of research
kept pointing to the same thing.

803
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,118
That carbon emissions
are a red herring...

804
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:48,950
and that we're past the point of no return
no matter what remedial actions we take?

805
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,951
You know your shit.

806
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:54,687
L sometimes envy the blissful ignorance
of those less well versed in their...

807
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,459
"shit.

808
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,023
As Professor Arnold always said...

809
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:02,035
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live...

810
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,469
"with the horrifying knowledge
of its host's fragile mortality.

811
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,234
You know, not a lot of people
knew about him.

812
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,347
You like spy movies, Mr. Devere?

813
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:21,046
Nowadays, they're all a little
serious for my taste.

814
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,189
But the old ones...

815
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,220
Marvelous.

816
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,657
Give me a far-fetched
theatrical plot any day.

817
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:30,321
The old Bond movies,
Oh, man!

818
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:34,025
When I was a kid, that was my dream job.

819
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,395
Gentleman spy.

820
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,105
I always felt the old Bond films
were only as good as the villain.

821
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:44,604
As a child, I rather fancied a future
as a colorful megalomaniac.

822
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,780
What a shame we both had to grow up.

823
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,617
Bon appétit.

824
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,128
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

825
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:02,889
I'll have my people
get in touch with yours...

826
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:04,555
and it's all good.

827
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,259
And thank you for such a happy meal.

828
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,974
Well, want me to follow him?

829
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,270
Nah.

830
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,046
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

831
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,206
We'll know his every move
for the next 24 hours.

832
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,909
Finally find out who he works for.

833
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,456
Valentine didn't let me
out of his sight.

834
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,115
All I got was this on the way in.

835
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:38,324
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

836
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,792
FBI have been monitoring them for years.

837
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,767
But you think Valentine is a supporter?

838
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:46,237
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

839
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,474
By the way..

840
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:53,672
our ever-growing list of missing persons
now includes Scandinavian royalty.

841
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,812
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

842
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,753
Just let me out,
you psycho!

843
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:04,756
I told you, you're free to go
any time you want.

844
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,156
As long as you agree to my conditions.

845
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,188
I don't agree...

846
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:12,095
and I am never ever going to agree!

847
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,495
Tough shit.

848
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:14,925
Bitch.

849
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:18,835
I want to speak to the British Council!

850
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:23,878
The list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks...

851
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:27,948
and world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers.

852
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:31,848
We are doing everything in our power
to find Princess Tilde.

853
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,183
You know,
governments and security forces worldwide...

854
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:39,054
are working together to find {he person
behind these abductions.

855
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:40,889
In other news,
people all over the world...

856
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:45,466
continue to wait in line day and nigh!
to get their free SIM cards.

857
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,068
Mrs. P, did you get one?

858
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:50,831
Yeah, I've been queuing up all day.

859
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:55,238
This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine...

860
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:58,243
has already seen
over a billion cards distributed.

861
00:58:58,402 --> 00:58:59,642
At ease.

862
00:59:01,805 --> 00:59:04,217
So you thought we were done
for the day, huh?

863
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,214
Well, we're not.

864
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,846
- A party?
- Tonight, in London.

865
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,925
- Who's this?
- Your target.

866
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,064
Your mission
is to use your NLP training...

867
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,597
to win over the individual
on the photograph in your envelope.

868
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,257
And when I say
"win over“...

869
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,228
I do mean in the biblical sense.

870
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,564
Easy.

871
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,531
Posh girls love a bit of rough.

872
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,334
We'll see about that, yeah?

873
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,407
We certainly will.

874
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,583
Hi!

875
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,051
Sorry, I just had to come over
and say, amazing eyes.

876
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,616
Are you wearing color contacts?

877
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,019
- No!
- You so are.

878
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,559
Oh, my God, negging!
That's hilarious.

879
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,593
I haven't heard anyone try that
since the noughties.

880
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:49,890
Excuse me?

881
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:50,929
"Nagging.

882
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:55,059
Saying something negative to a pretty girl
in order to undermine her social value.

883
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,262
It's supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

884
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:00,899
Absurdly basic
neuro-linguistic programming technique.

885
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,203
Is it just me, or does this champagne
taste a little bit funny?

886
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,243
- It's an acquired taste, mate.
- I think it's just cheap.

887
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:07,245
Get one of these instead.
They're delicious.

888
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:10,112
If you're into seduction techniques,
this guy is textbook.

889
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,049
See what he just did?
It's called an opinion opener.

890
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,712
He got you talking
with a neutral question...

891
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:16,585
got all of us involved
in the conversation...

892
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,419
so that you craved individual attention.

893
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:20,459
No, I'm just saying
the champagne tastes rank.

894
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,392
Lady Sophie Montague,
Herring.

895
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,826
Phone call for you at reception.

896
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,728
- Be right back.
- We'll see you in a bit, yeah?

897
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,266
See you in a bit.

898
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,267
Budge up, Rox,
I'm feeling a bit rough.

899
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:30,928
- Are you all right?
- No.

900
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,129
Sorry to eavesdrop...

901
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,833
but there's a much easier way
to guarantee getting someone home.

902
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,602
Rohypnol.

903
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,510
Or even something stronger.

904
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,762
Who the fuck are you?

905
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,769
Where am I?

906
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:06,334
This knife...

907
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,533
can save your life.

908
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:13,803
Fuck!

909
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:17,014
My employer's got two questions
for you, Eggsy.

910
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,051
What the fuck is Kingsman?

911
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,847
And who's Harry Hart?

912
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,854
I don't know who the fuck that is!

913
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:23,821
Shit!

914
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,792
Eggsy, I just killed two of your friends
who gave me the same bullshit answer!

915
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,329
Fuck!

916
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,323
Just cut the fucking ropes, please!

917
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,524
Hey, Eggsy?!

918
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,033
Is Kingsman worth dying for?

919
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:38,638
Fuck you!

920
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,217
Congratulations.

921
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,583
Bloody well done.

922
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,485
How did the others do?

923
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,424
Roxy passed with flying colors.

924
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:04,226
Charlie's up next,
Want to watch?

925
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,100
Yeah, all right.

926
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:11,664
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

927
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,171
No, it fucking isn't!

928
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,173
Shit, I'll tell you what you want.
Please!

929
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:16,606
Chester King is Arthur.

930
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,007
Arthur's head of a spy agency.
It's called Kingsman.

931
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:20,705
- Get me out of here!
- Thank you, Charlie.

932
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,213
Much appreciated.

933
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,750
Come on!
That wasn't the fucking deal!

934
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:27,451
Fuck!

935
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,761
I had such high hopes for you.

936
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,899
You're a bloody disgrace.

937
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,056
Arthur, I'm sorry.

938
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,233
At least untie me.

939
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:43,902
Untie yourself.

940
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,735
Arthur, please.

941
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,602
I'm the fucking son of the
... Shit!

942
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,271
Anyone?
Hello?

943
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,974
Galahad, Percival,
congratulations.

944
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,084
Your candidates have reached
the final stage of the testing process.

945
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,781
As tradition allows,
you now have 24 hours to spend with them.

946
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,588
Eggsy, you should know your
father reached this point.

947
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:09,319
From now on...

948
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,265
there are no safety nets,
understood?

949
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,001
Good,
Dismissed.

950
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,102
Charlie, time to go home.

951
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,608
Fuck you.

952
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,276
Fucking dad's gonna hear about this!

953
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:29,439
"To pee or not to pee?

954
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:32,517
That was the headline...

955
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:35,283
the day after I defused
a dirty bomb in Paris.

956
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,618
"Germany,
1, England, 5.

957
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:38,851
Missed that game.

958
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,996
I was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at the Pentagon.

959
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,798
My first mission.

960
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,460
Foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

961
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,304
Not everybody would
thank you for that one.

962
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:56,473
The point is, Eggsy,
nobody thanked me for any of them.

963
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:00,671
Front page news on all these occasions
was celebrity nonsense.

964
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,508
Because it's the nature of Kingsman
that our achievements remain secret.

965
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:08,319
A gentleman's name should appear
in the newspaper only three times.

966
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:10,822
When he's born, when he marries,
and when he dies.

967
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,154
And we are' first and foremost,
gentlemen.

968
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:15,827
That's me fucked then.

969
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,697
It's like Charlie said,
I'm just a pleb.

970
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,856
Nonsense.

971
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,526
Being a gentleman has nothing to do
with the circumstances of one's birth.

972
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:25,336
Being a gentleman
is something one learns.

973
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:27,905
Yeah, but how?

974
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,072
All right, first lesson.

975
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,678
You should've asked me
before you took a seat.

976
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,674
Second lesson...

977
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:37,015
how to make a proper martini.

978
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,078
Yes, Harry.

979
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,717
Goddamn it! This fucking hurts!

980
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:48,719
You're the one who asked
for a biometric security system.

981
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,023
What's wrong with a simple switch?

982
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,187
A simple switch?

983
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:55,029
This is an extremely dangerous machine.

984
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:59,731
It should only be operated by someone
as responsible and sane as me.

985
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,205
Bad shit could happen
if this falls into the wrong hands.

986
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,075
We done here? Shit!

987
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,877
No, Now this one.

988
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,074
For the test at the church.

989
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,084
This one just has a short range.

990
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,779
A simple switch will do.

991
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,629
So are you gonna teach me how to
talk proper, like in My Fair Lady?

992
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:25,266
Don't be absurd.

993
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:28,092
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.

994
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,568
It's about being at ease
in one's own skin.

995
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,263
As Hemingway said,
"There is nothing noble...

996
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,807
"in being superior to your fellow man.

997
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,735
"True nobility is being superior
to your former self.

998
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,784
Now, the first thing every
gentleman needs is a good suit.

999
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,253
By which I mean, a bespoke suit.
Never off-the-peg.

1000
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,790
And Kingsman suits
are always bulletproof.

1001
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,758
So let's get you measured,
and then, whether you get the job or not...

1002
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:59,298
you'll have a lasting and useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.

1003
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,097
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

1004
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,432
Fitting Room Two is available.

1005
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:09,600
One does not use Fitting Room Two
when one is popping one's cherry.

1006
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:13,477
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting Room Three
while we wait.

1007
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:25,121
So we going up or down?

1008
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,453
Neither.

1009
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:28,685
Is this it?

1010
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:31,958
Of course not.
Pull the hook on your left.

1011
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:39,969
Oh, yes.

1012
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,636
Very, very nice.

1013
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,171
You're going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit.

1014
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:52,480
An oxford is any formal shoe
with open lacing.

1015
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:55,851
This additional decorative piece
is called broguing.

1016
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,184
"Oxfords not brogues.

1017
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,985
Words to live by, Eggsy.

1018
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,822
Words to live by,
Try a pair.

1019
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,327
Your weapon scores are excellent,
by the way.

1020
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,731
These you are familiar with,
and this is our standard issue pistol.

1021
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:10,530
It's quite unique,
as you'll see.

1022
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,038
It also fires a shotgun cartridge
for use in messy close-range situations.

1023
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,676
- How do they feel?
- Yeah, good.

1024
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:17,175
Now do your very best impersonation...

1025
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,006
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.

1026
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,745
No, Eggs?

1027
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,151
That is sick.

1028
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,159
In the old days,
they had a phone in the heel as well.

1029
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:33,350
How do I get it back in?

1030
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:37,396
Well, it's coated in one of the fastest
acting neurotoxins known to man...

1031
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,056
so very carefully.

1032
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:44,699
Now, I've had a lot of fun with this.

1033
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:47,865
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

1034
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:50,534
A poison, harmless when ingested...

1035
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,577
but at a time convenient to you...

1036
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:56,740
can be remotely activated.
Primed.

1037
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,083
Lethal.

1038
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,549
What about these?
What do these do?

1039
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,892
- Electrocute you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1040
01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,891
- It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up!

1041
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,360
If you want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

1042
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,590
A gentleman traditionally
wears the signet on his left hand.

1043
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,735
But a Kingsman wears it on
whichever hand happens to be dominant.

1044
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,234
Touch the contact behind the ring...

1045
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:17,530
it delivers 50,000 volts.

1046
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,909
And what about them?
What makes them so special?

1047
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,066
Nothing.

1048
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,940
That technology has caught up
with the spy world.

1049
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,745
Put it back, Eggsy.

1050
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,586
Perfect timing.

1051
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,619
The gentleman's just finished.

1052
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,092
Mr. Devere!

1053
01:08:42,585 --> 01:08:44,258
What a coincidence.

1054
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,766
You are totally the reason I'm here.

1055
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,095
When you left my house...

1056
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:53,070
I was thirsting for that dope-ass
smoking jacket you had on.

1057
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,731
And since I'm going
to Royal Ascot...

1058
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,934
and, apparently,
you need one of these penguin suits...

1059
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,639
here I am.

1060
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,236
What are you doing here?

1061
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,813
What's up, man?

1062
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,109
Richmond Valentine.

1063
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,443
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

1064
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,453
Another coincidence. So am I.

1065
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,917
Have you had any chance
to think further on my proposal?

1066
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,082
Most definitely.

1067
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:16,286
My people will be getting
in touch with you very soon.

1068
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:17,931
I guarantee it.

1069
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:19,964
A word of advice.

1070
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,496
Ascot requires top hat.

1071
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,633
I might suggest Lock and Co. Hatters.

1072
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,498
Saint James's.

1073
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:29,939
"Lox" as in smoked fish?

1074
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,803
As in, "locked up.

1075
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,785
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

1076
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,447
You all talk so funny.

1077
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:51,523
Gentlemen, would you look after him,
please?

1078
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,341
Now this...

1079
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,378
is a dope-ass top hat.

1080
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,349
Gazelle, let's go ascoting.

1081
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:15,049
Your hat oaks fine' Gazelle.

1082
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,055
Come on!
Don't make me late for the queen.

1083
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:21,489
Come on, Gazelle!
We're gonna be late.

1084
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,187
How far is Ascot?

1085
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:24,688
How fax?

1086
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,199
Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir?

1087
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,195
Sit down.

1088
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,674
Pretty dog.

1089
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,376
What's his name?

1090
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:41,537
J.B.

1091
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,877
- As in "James Bond?
- No.

1092
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,675
"Jason Bourne?

1093
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,844
No.
"Jack Bauer.

1094
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:49,212
Oh!

1095
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:50,880
Bravo.

1096
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,685
It pains me to admit it...

1097
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:55,728
but I think that one day,
you might be as good a spy...

1098
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:57,364
as any of them.

1099
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,066
Take it.

1100
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,108
Shoot the dog.

1101
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,218
This weapon is live.

1102
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,290
Shoot the dog.

1103
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,122
Give me the gun.

1104
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,173
At least the girl's got balls.

1105
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:23,806
Get out.

1106
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,475
I knew you couldn't make it.

1107
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,122
Go home.

1108
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:35,459
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

1109
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,212
Welcome to Kingsman...

1110
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,317
Lancelot.

1111
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:28,671
Mum!

1112
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,209
Eggsy?

1113
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,714
Oh, God. Where have you been?

1114
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:33,876
I've been so worried about you.

1115
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:39,088
Oh, my days.
Look how big you've grown!

1116
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,924
- Where is he?
- I'm fine.

1117
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,762
Eggsy, please,
just don't get involved.

1118
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,598
I should never have left you
on your own.

1119
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,206
This stops right now.

1120
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,432
I'll be right back.

1121
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,201
Eggs?

1122
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,910
Oi, Dean!

1123
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,746
Mugsy, so you're back.

1124
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,782
What, you gone and nicked
a fucking taxi, now?

1125
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,386
Yeah.

1126
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,579
Can I have a word
about my mum's black eye?

1127
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,285
You want to have a word with me,
you get out of that cab...

1128
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,120
I'll knock you straight back down
on your fucking arse.

1129
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,386
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

1130
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,568
Go on, lads,
It'll be two hits.

1131
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,761
Me hitting him,
him hitting the floor.

1132
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,604
Come on, then,
you prick.

1133
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,639
Let's see what you got.
Want a bit of me?

1134
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:29,606
What are you doing?

1135
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:30,641
No, no, no!

1136
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,608
Get out of the fucking car!

1137
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,644
What are you doing?
Where you going, you mug?

1138
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,111
Go on, you got no bollocks!

1139
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:37,907
Come on, bruv,
he hit my fucking mum!

1140
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,451
Come back when you've grown a pair!

1141
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:40,484
Mugs?!

1142
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:04,367
You throw away...

1143
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,504
your biggest opportunity
over a fucking dog.

1144
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,849
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

1145
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:14,179
You shot a dog
just to get a fucking job.

1146
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:15,611
Yes, I did.

1147
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:22,494
And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit!

1148
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:26,556
You shot your dog and had it stuffed?

1149
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:27,962
You fucking freak.

1150
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:29,501
No, I shot my dog...

1151
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,331
and then I brought him home
and continued to care for him...

1152
01:15:31,494 --> 01:15:33,906
for the next 11 years
until he died of pancreatitis.

1153
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,303
- What?
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

1154
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:40,140
It was a fucking blank.

1155
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,314
Remember Amelia?

1156
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,211
Yeah.

1157
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,510
She didn't drown.

1158
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,415
She works in our tech department in Berlin.
She's fine.

1159
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,816
Limits must be tested...

1160
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:51,584
a Kingsman only condones
the risking of a life to save another.

1161
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:54,728
Like my dad saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his.

1162
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,557
Or have you got him
stuffed here and all?

1163
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:01,693
Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?

1164
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,169
Harry, listen to this.

1165
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,072
Valentine is at last
saying something of note.

1166
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,741
Do you know what I love
about pen and paper?

1167
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,739
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1168
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:20,518
Our worldwide tour
was a complete success.

1169
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,122
We have total coverall.

1170
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:26,089
Like when all your numbers in bingo
are crossed out.

1171
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,124
Bingo?

1172
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:30,696
Bingo, the game.
You have played bingo, right?

1173
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:33,363
Do I look like I play bingo?

1174
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:36,593
Point is...

1175
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:41,730
if our tests go well at the church tomorrow,
we are good to go.

1176
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,400
South Glade Mission Church.

1177
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,474
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
- Will do.

1178
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:49,274
Harry, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna do whatever..

1179
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,439
You should be.

1180
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,052
You just stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

1181
01:16:59,415 --> 01:17:01,122
And I say to you...

1182
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,557
bear witness!

1183
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:05,289
Watch the news,
Watch the news.

1184
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,762
AIDS!

1185
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:08,065
Floods!

1186
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:10,329
The blood of the innocent, spilled!

1187
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:15,670
And yet, there are those who doubt
this is the wrath of God.

1188
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:24,179
Our filthy government condones
sodomy, divorce, abortion!

1189
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,911
And yet, some still doubt...

1190
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:30,956
this is the work of the antichrist!

1191
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:35,994
You do not have to be
a Jew, a nigger, a whore...

1192
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,928
or an atheistic, science-loving
evolution spouter...

1193
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:40,700
Charming sermon.

1194
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,529
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

1195
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,136
So, my friends...

1196
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:47,331
although he is a just God.
he is justly a vengeful one...

1197
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,477
and there can be no turning back...

1198
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,271
from the almighty wrath...

1199
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:53,879
Are you sure we're out of range?

1200
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,672
We're over 1,000 feet away.
What's wrong?

1201
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,112
What if the calculations are wrong?

1202
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:58,843
You just have to trust me.

1203
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:04,513
Jew, nigger, fag lovers,
and the devil is burning them...

1204
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,988
for all eternity.

1205
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:07,320
Would you excuse me?

1206
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:09,159
Where are you going?

1207
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,794
Hey!
What's your problem?

1208
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,800
I'm a Catholic whore...

1209
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:18,530
currently enjoying congress out of wedlock
with my black, Jewish boyfriend...

1210
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,231
who works in a military abortion clinic.

1211
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,173
So, hail Satan...

1212
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:25,342
and have a lovely afternoon, madam.

1213
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,149
Oh, shit, He's leaving.

1214
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,876
I'm starting the test now.

1215
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,412
Let's hope enough of these freaks
have our SIM cards.

1216
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:40,092
I kindly ask you to sit down,
my friend!

1217
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:41,319
Just leave this church!

1218
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,861
You just leave this church
like the infidel you are!

1219
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,597
Satan cannot save you now!
You will eat your babies.

1220
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:53,262
You will drown in the
blood of the Lord!

1221
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:54,908
He will not save you!

1222
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,104
Holy fuck!

1223
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:06,045
Shit, I can't watch this,
Get over here.

1224
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,252
Jeez! Fuck.

1225
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:53,058
Galahad, can you hear me?

1226
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,297
Harry!

1227
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,235
Harry, what the heck is going on?

1228
01:19:58,394 --> 01:19:59,839
Could you turn the volume down, please?

1229
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,143
I didn't expect it to be that effective.

1230
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,437
What kind of response are we talking?

1231
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:06,302
100 percent.

1232
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,440
So, everyones been affected,
whether they have a SIM card or not.

1233
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,012
And we get the added benefit
of wiping out the Kingsman.

1234
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,485
Not yet.

1235
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:11,740
You need to see this.

1236
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,660
What did you do to me?

1237
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,624
I had no control.

1238
01:23:13,956 --> 01:23:15,435
L killed all those people.

1239
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:18,599
I wanted to.

1240
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,830
Clever, isn't it?

1241
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,703
In simple terms,
it's a neurological wave...

1242
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:24,435
that triggers
the centers of aggression...

1243
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,307
and switches off inhibitors.

1244
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,782
Transmitted through your nasty,
free SIM cards, I assume.

1245
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,885
Do you know what this is like?

1246
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,353
It's like those old movies we both love.

1247
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,620
Now, I'm going to tell you
my whole plan...

1248
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:45,026
and then I'm going to come up with
some absurd and convoluted way to kill you...

1249
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,827
and you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

1250
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:50,370
Sounds good to me.

1251
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,231
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1252
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,368
No!

1253
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,216
Is he dead?

1254
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:11,858
That tends to happen
when you shoot someone in the head.

1255
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,185
It feels good, right?

1256
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,720
No, no, it does not feel good.
It feels fucking awful.

1257
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,194
What? You just killed
how many people in that church?

1258
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:19,331
This is one guy.

1259
01:24:19,488 --> 01:24:21,490
No, no, they killed each other.

1260
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:26,270
Okay, send out the countdown clock.

1261
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,102
This party starts tomorrow.

1262
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,142
Arthur?

1263
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,771
Are you there?

1264
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:11,244
Sadly, I am.

1265
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:15,077
Assemble the Kingsmen.

1266
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:22,921
Can't you see that everything We done
has been about trying to repay him?

1267
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:45,816
I see a young man with potential...

1268
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:49,282
who wants to do something
good with his life.

1269
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:08,305
Arthur, Harry's dead.

1270
01:26:08,964 --> 01:26:11,376
Galahad is dead.

1271
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,979
Hence, we have just drunk
a toast to him.

1272
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:17,173
Well, then you know
what that psycho's doing.

1273
01:26:17,339 --> 01:26:19,979
How many people around the world
have got those SIM cards?

1274
01:26:20,142 --> 01:26:22,520
Valentine can send his signal
to any of them, all of them.

1275
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:24,715
If they all go homicidal
at the same time then..

1276
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,190
Indeed, and thanks
to Galahads recordings...

1277
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,989
we have Valentine's confession.

1278
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:33,531
The intelligence has been passed on
to the relevant authorities.

1279
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,032
Our work is complete...

1280
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:39,661
and a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend, it is, too.

1281
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,667
And that's it?

1282
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:44,003
Come sit down, boy.

1283
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:52,375
This is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy.

1284
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:56,685
And we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1285
01:26:57,345 --> 01:27:00,349
Galahad was very fond of you.

1286
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:04,929
And on this occasion...

1287
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:08,432
I think it's acceptable for us
to bend the rules a little.

1288
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:12,031
Are these all Kingsmen?

1289
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:14,538
Yes, they're founder members.

1290
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,934
I want you to join me in a toast.

1291
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:22,204
To Galahad.

1292
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:24,707
To Galahad.

1293
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,884
Harry says you don't like
to break rules, Arthur.

1294
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,450
Why now?

1295
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:34,889
You're very good, Eggsy.

1296
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:38,623
Perhaps I will make you my proposal
for Galahard's position.

1297
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:42,262
Provided, of course,
that we can see eye to eye...

1298
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,563
on certain political matters.

1299
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,931
Can you guess...

1300
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,635
what this is?

1301
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,473
I don't have to,
Harry showed me.

1302
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,137
You click it,
I die.

1303
01:27:55,303 --> 01:27:57,112
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1304
01:27:59,074 --> 01:27:59,745
Bravo.

1305
01:28:00,408 --> 01:28:03,582
Valentine won you over,
somehow.

1306
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,589
Once he explained,
I understood.

1307
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:07,988
When you get a virus...

1308
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,489
you get a fever.

1309
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:13,656
That's the human body raising
its core temperature to kill the virus.

1310
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:16,098
Planet Earth works the same way.

1311
01:28:16,258 --> 01:28:18,169
Global warming is the fever.

1312
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:21,136
Mankind is the virus.

1313
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,674
We're making our planet sick.

1314
01:28:23,832 --> 01:28:26,438
A cull is our only hope.

1315
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,842
If we don't reduce
our population ourselves...

1316
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:31,610
there is only one of two ways
this can go.

1317
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:36,017
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.

1318
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,187
Either way...

1319
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:39,816
The result is the same.

1320
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,619
The virus dies.

1321
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:46,131
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

1322
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:48,791
Well, if we don't do something,
nature will.

1323
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:53,303
Sometimes a culling is the only way
to ensure that this species survives...

1324
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:56,134
and history will see Valentine...

1325
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:58,539
as the man who saved
humanity from extinction.

1326
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:02,479
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

1327
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:03,843
All his rich mates,
they get to live...

1328
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,508
and anyone he thinks is worth saving,
he's keeping them safe...

1329
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,655
whether they agree with him or not.

1330
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,983
And you, Eggsy.

1331
01:29:11,513 --> 01:29:13,493
In Harry's honor...

1332
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:18,324
l am inviting you
to be part of a new world.

1333
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:22,698
It's time to make your decision.

1334
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:31,544
I'd rather be with Harry.

1335
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:33,077
Thanks.

1336
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,212
So be it.

1337
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:54,762
The problem with us common types...

1338
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:56,527
is that we're light-fingered.

1339
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,433
Kingsman's taught me a lot...

1340
01:29:59,594 --> 01:30:00,868
but sleight of hand...

1341
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,270
Yes, they're founder members.

1342
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:07,209
I had that down already.

1343
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:13,110
You dirty little fucking...

1344
01:30:13,275 --> 01:30:14,720
prick.

1345
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:50,752
It's okay, Lancelot Put it down.

1346
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:53,449
It's verified.

1347
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,423
Arthur's phone is receiving update
texts about getting to safety.

1348
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,327
- We don't have a lot of time.
- What are you going to do?

1349
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,627
The question is,
what are we going to do?

1350
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,499
God knows who's in Valentine's pocket
and who's not.

1351
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:07,663
We have no choice.

1352
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,834
We are gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

1353
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:15,612
Follow me.

1354
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,797
What the fuck is this?

1355
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,800
I have no idea.

1356
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:39,965
What you're playing with...

1357
01:31:40,128 --> 01:31:42,836
is a prototype personal
transatmospheric vehicle.

1358
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,308
It was developed as pan of
Reagan's Star Wars project.

1359
01:31:45,467 --> 01:31:48,380
It's pretty basic,
but it should still work.

1360
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:51,014
We're gonna take out
one of Valentine's satellites.

1361
01:31:51,373 --> 01:31:53,853
We're gonna break the chain,
stop the signal.

1362
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,682
It'll take him a couple of hours
to reroute it...

1363
01:31:56,344 --> 01:32:00,724
which buys us enough time for you
to get me into Valentine's mainframe...

1364
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:02,691
so I can shut it down.

1365
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,161
Lancelot,
you're going to be using it.

1366
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,697
Get into your halo suit.

1367
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:21,075
Swedish Prime Minister,
requesting permission to Sand.

1368
01:32:27,075 --> 01:32:28,850
Permission granted.

1369
01:32:32,414 --> 01:32:34,917
- Please.
- Thank you.

1370
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:37,188
- How many more are we expecting?
- Not many.

1371
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:38,695
Most have their own bunkers.

1372
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:42,198
I figure we're just getting
the really nervous ones.

1373
01:32:42,424 --> 01:32:44,426
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1374
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:48,708
It seems the implant
can emit some kind of counter signal...

1375
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:52,538
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM cards.

1376
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,737
The waves that turn everyone
into a psycho killer.

1377
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,440
Quite. But what he
probably didn't tell anyone...

1378
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:01,883
is it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command.

1379
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:06,219
Valentine selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning...

1380
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:09,225
but he had to be sure they didn't blab
to the wrong people beforehand.

1381
01:33:09,384 --> 01:33:11,091
How does this help us right now?

1382
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:13,054
It doesn't.

1383
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,798
Roxy, here we go!

1384
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:31,308
The higher you go,
the more the balloons expand.

1385
01:33:31,473 --> 01:33:33,316
When you reach
the edge of the atmosphere...

1386
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:35,614
they'll explode.

1387
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:37,779
You'll need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

1388
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,289
Edge of the atmosphere.

1389
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,758
And once you've deployed,
you'll need to release for descent, fast.

1390
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:44,991
Good luck.

1391
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:49,324
- You can do this, okay?
- Yeah.

1392
01:33:49,491 --> 01:33:52,301
Eggsy, come on,
Time is not our friend.

1393
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:16,784
You're getting in
on Arthur's invitation.

1394
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:18,157
You're gonna need to blend in.

1395
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,457
I'm supposed to be Arthur?

1396
01:34:19,621 --> 01:34:22,625
His invitation is in his phone.
You give them this.

1397
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:25,293
- Give his real name, Chester King.
- What about you?

1398
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,871
I'm your pilot,
I'm gonna stay here.

1399
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,032
Is that gonna fit me?

1400
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:31,700
A bespoke suit always fits.

1401
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:33,675
Just be grateful
Harry had it made for you.

1402
01:34:34,636 --> 01:34:35,637
Get dressed.

1403
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:38,140
What the fuck's wrong with them?

1404
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:41,215
I don't know, Could have something to do
with the mass genocide.

1405
01:34:41,376 --> 01:34:43,322
Give me the mic.

1406
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:46,682
Henna

1407
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:49,795
Everybody, listen up!
Hello, hello!

1408
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:52,158
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

1409
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,164
I just wanna remind you that today...

1410
01:34:55,323 --> 01:34:57,894
is a day of celebration.

1411
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:02,230
We must put aside
all thoughts of death...

1412
01:35:02,397 --> 01:35:04,308
and focus on birth.

1413
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:07,812
The birth of a new age.

1414
01:35:09,003 --> 01:35:13,975
We mustn't mourn those
who give their lives today.

1415
01:35:14,142 --> 01:35:16,088
We should honor their sacrifice...

1416
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:18,246
Has she got my number to call me back?
I got a new phone.

1417
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:21,587
Wand their roles in saving
the human race.

1418
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:27,693
We must put aside doubt and guilt.

1419
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:32,663
You are the chosen people.

1420
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:37,732
When folks tell their kids
the story of Noah's Ark...

1421
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:38,877
is Noah the bad guy?

1422
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:39,704
No!

1423
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:41,869
Is God the bad guy?

1424
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:42,707
No!

1425
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,282
How about the animals
marching two by two?

1426
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,248
No!

1427
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,215
Of course not!

1428
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:49,686
Yeah, that's it!

1429
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:53,621
Let's tum those frowns upside down.

1430
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:55,624
Eat, drink...

1431
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,456
and parry!

1432
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:03,058
And I will see you all in the new age.

1433
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,422
Rox, ifs me.

1434
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:32,261
How's the view?

1435
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,160
- Hideous
- Mine's pretty sweet.

1436
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:40,272
- They made you one of these suits yet?
- No, not yet.

1437
01:36:40,428 --> 01:36:42,772
You've got something to
look forward to {hen.

1438
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,501
We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.

1439
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:48,276
Good luck.

1440
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:56,944
Looking good, Eggsy.

1441
01:36:59,614 --> 01:37:02,322
Feeling good, Merlin.

1442
01:37:07,622 --> 01:37:09,192
This is November-Z-ll-Y-Charlie-Kilo...

1443
01:37:09,357 --> 01:37:11,803
requesting permission to land.

1444
01:37:14,796 --> 01:37:17,333
Permission is granted.

1445
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,811
Fuck me.

1446
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,477
Eggsy, we're on.

1447
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:08,182
Chester King.

1448
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:11,163
Mr. King, welcome.

1449
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:15,331
I'm sure you've adhered to Valentine's
strict no-weapons policy...

1450
01:38:15,490 --> 01:38:16,833
- but if you don't object...
- Of course.

1451
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,197
Thank you.

1452
01:38:18,693 --> 01:38:20,832
Do you have any luggage?

1453
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:25,242
Congratulations, Mycroft, you just
graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1454
01:38:25,867 --> 01:38:28,347
- You cheeky.
- Understood?

1455
01:38:28,503 --> 01:38:29,743
Good.

1456
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:32,676
Thank you.

1457
01:38:57,932 --> 01:39:02,574
Eggsy, find a laptop, get me online.
The clock is ticking.

1458
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:06,446
And remember,
try to blend in.

1459
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,587
Would sir care for a drink?

1460
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,416
Martini.

1461
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:12,751
Gin, not vodka,
obviously.

1462
01:39:12,914 --> 01:39:16,623
Stirred for 10 seconds while glancing
at an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1463
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:18,457
Thank you.

1464
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:23,064
Merlin, are you clocking this?

1465
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:25,294
Yes, l am,
Stay focused.

1466
01:39:25,927 --> 01:39:28,100
Lancelot' you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1467
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:29,934
Yes, Merlin.

1468
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,742
Eggsy, get me online now.

1469
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:35,636
Yep, I'm on it.

1470
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,943
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1471
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:41,082
Those balloons won't last much longer.

1472
01:39:41,943 --> 01:39:43,923
Prepare to engage missile.

1473
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:00,499
Society's dead.

1474
01:40:00,962 --> 01:40:02,805
Long live society.

1475
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:05,141
Amen to that.

1476
01:40:06,601 --> 01:40:08,638
- I'm Morten Lindstrom.
- Chester King.

1477
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:10,313
How'd you get online?
I couldn't.

1478
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:13,652
It's a closed network, you see.
Pre-authorized connections only.

1479
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,153
I've got a fix on the satellite.

1480
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:20,451
Do you have the correct time?

1481
01:40:20,615 --> 01:40:21,821
I think I'm still in my last time zone.

1482
01:40:21,983 --> 01:40:23,360
Yeah, yeah,
Let's see now.

1483
01:40:37,465 --> 01:40:38,466
Eggsy, I'm in.

1484
01:40:38,633 --> 01:40:39,703
Get your arse back to the plane, now.

1485
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,471
- On my way.
- Lancelot, good luck!

1486
01:40:41,636 --> 01:40:43,809
Firing in 3...2...

1487
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:52,179
Nice and slow.

1488
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:53,518
Fuck are you doing here?

1489
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:56,025
Well, my family were invited,
obviously.

1490
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:57,821
Now, get the fuck up!
Slowly.

1491
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,897
Shit. Lancelot,
hurry up and fire!

1492
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,659
That other balloon is gonna blow!

1493
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:05,861
Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second!

1494
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,675
Valentine! I've caught a fucking spy!

1495
01:41:11,332 --> 01:41:12,367
V-Glass, zoom.

1496
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:14,570
Oh, fuck! It's that young valet.

1497
01:41:18,706 --> 01:41:20,083
Son of a bitch.

1498
01:41:20,675 --> 01:41:21,745
Go! it!

1499
01:41:31,886 --> 01:41:33,194
Oh, shit,
Sound the alarm!

1500
01:41:35,723 --> 01:41:36,758
I'm not taking any chances.

1501
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,426
Okay, you send out
the two-minute warning.

1502
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:41,073
I'm starting the override.
All right, let's do this.

1503
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:44,034
Countdown initiated.

1504
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:55,414
- You see him?
- Right here.

1505
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:05,458
Eggsy, take a left.

1506
01:42:06,253 --> 01:42:07,254
Two guards, up ahead.

1507
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,908
Lancelot!
Release now!

1508
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:33,755
Eggsy, straight ahead,
then right.

1509
01:42:34,115 --> 01:42:35,116
There's two more.

1510
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,924
All right, everybody on your feet!

1511
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:42,294
Countdown to V-day!

1512
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:43,958
Welcome in the new age!

1513
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,437
Hal spin.

1514
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:11,460
Eggsy, next left,
down the narrow runner'!

1515
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,195
Here we go!

1516
01:43:21,362 --> 01:43:21,999
10...

1517
01:43:22,997 --> 01:43:24,340
9...

1518
01:43:24,832 --> 01:43:25,537
8...

1519
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,171
7...

1520
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:29,244
6...

1521
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:31,175
5...

1522
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:32,513
4...

1523
01:43:34,008 --> 01:43:34,748
3...

1524
01:43:34,909 --> 01:43:35,683
2..

1525
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:37,553
1!

1526
01:43:43,584 --> 01:43:45,427
Nice! Well clone, both of you.

1527
01:43:46,187 --> 01:43:47,188
It's networking!

1528
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:49,391
It's supposed to be working!
What the fuck?

1529
01:43:56,197 --> 01:43:56,868
Yes!

1530
01:43:57,031 --> 01:43:58,374
Well done, Rox,
Good girl.

1531
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:04,239
We've lost one of our satellites.

1532
01:44:13,781 --> 01:44:17,558
Oh, no, no.
There's no way I can hack past that.

1533
01:44:23,124 --> 01:44:24,125
What's going on?

1534
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:26,396
Is there a problem?

1535
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:28,904
Come on,
There's no need for guns.

1536
01:44:29,063 --> 01:44:30,565
I'm just a pilot.

1537
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:34,602
Fuck,
Merlin!

1538
01:44:37,404 --> 01:44:38,974
Get in here!

1539
01:44:43,244 --> 01:44:44,416
Come on!

1540
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,291
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1541
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,451
We can't.

1542
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:52,097
I can! get into Valentines machine.

1543
01:44:52,253 --> 01:44:53,823
He's got biometric security.

1544
01:44:55,322 --> 01:44:58,633
You're gonna have to get in there and make
sure his hand never touches that desk.

1545
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:00,329
Are you taking the fucking piss?

1546
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:01,768
I'm afraid not.

1547
01:45:04,932 --> 01:45:05,933
Let's have that then.

1548
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:08,944
This is mine.

1549
01:45:09,436 --> 01:45:11,347
I'll show you yours.

1550
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:29,633
Good choice.

1551
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:33,862
How long to re-link the satellite chain?

1552
01:45:34,028 --> 01:45:35,302
It'll take an hour, maybe two.

1553
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:37,533
Bullshit! Just bring these two
closer together.

1554
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:39,041
But that's not yours.

1555
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:46,480
V-Glass, call E-man.

1556
01:45:47,308 --> 01:45:48,651
E, it's V.

1557
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:50,811
Listen, man,
I got a little hiccup on this end.

1558
01:45:50,978 --> 01:45:51,979
I need to piggyback.

1559
01:45:52,146 --> 01:45:56,151
One of my satellites just went down,
but it's right next to one of yours.

1560
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:58,163
You read my mind.

1561
01:45:58,819 --> 01:46:00,389
How long before you make that happen?

1562
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:04,525
Go.

1563
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,676
All right, we should be
coming back online.

1564
01:46:13,567 --> 01:46:14,511
10 percent.

1565
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:18,411
Shit!

1566
01:46:18,572 --> 01:46:20,381
Eggsy, Valentine's using
someone else's satellite.

1567
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:22,521
He's going to reconnect the chain.

1568
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:24,087
It's going to take him no time at all.

1569
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:26,183
It's at 20 percent.

1570
01:46:44,098 --> 01:46:47,375
Eggsy, it seems Valentines got a present
for you, Get a move on!

1571
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:22,278
Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?

1572
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:24,107
Not yet, but he will be soon.

1573
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:25,978
Good.

1574
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:39,920
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1575
01:47:53,133 --> 01:47:54,134
As am I.

1576
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:56,645
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

1577
01:47:57,104 --> 01:47:59,948
Rox, I need a favor.

1578
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:01,142
Call my mum.

1579
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,844
Tell her to lock herself away from Dean.

1580
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:04,520
And the baby...

1581
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:07,147
and tell her I love her.

1582
01:48:16,123 --> 01:48:17,363
For fuck's sake.

1583
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:24,869
Merlin, remember those implants
you said were of no use to us?

1584
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:27,839
Any chance you can turn them on?

1585
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:32,346
All right.

1586
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:34,986
My turn to play,
Valentine.

1587
01:48:43,484 --> 01:48:44,656
Oh, no!

1588
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:47,230
What the fuck is he doing?
I can't stop this.

1589
01:49:00,667 --> 01:49:01,702
Yes, please.

1590
01:49:05,372 --> 01:49:06,544
No!

1591
01:50:03,297 --> 01:50:05,402
Oh, my God!

1592
01:50:05,566 --> 01:50:07,568
That is fucking spectacular!

1593
01:50:07,734 --> 01:50:10,476
Merlin, you're a fucking genius!

1594
01:50:10,637 --> 01:50:13,811
What the fuck is happening out there?

1595
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,420
Aren't you that princess
who went missing?

1596
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,615
Can you get me out?

1597
01:50:21,248 --> 01:50:23,159
If I do,
will you give me a kiss?

1598
01:50:23,317 --> 01:50:24,762
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

1599
01:50:24,918 --> 01:50:26,920
If you get me out right now,
I'll give you more than just a kiss.

1600
01:50:29,156 --> 01:50:30,430
You motherfucker.

1601
01:50:30,591 --> 01:50:32,434
Did you really think
I was stupid enough...

1602
01:50:32,593 --> 01:50:34,766
to implant one of those
things in my own head?

1603
01:50:35,229 --> 01:50:36,765
What are you,
fucking crazy?

1604
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:40,007
All those innocent people killed
and for what?

1605
01:50:40,901 --> 01:50:43,745
You didn't stop shit!

1606
01:50:45,105 --> 01:50:47,107
Fine, I've locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

1607
01:50:47,274 --> 01:50:50,118
As I said, put your daughter
in the bathroom and throw away the key.

1608
01:50:50,911 --> 01:50:53,289
It's still happening!

1609
01:50:53,447 --> 01:50:54,619
You're fucking insane!

1610
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:55,919
Just do fl.

1611
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:24,553
Eggsy, the signal's started!

1612
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,885
Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now!

1613
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:28,992
Sorry, love.

1614
01:51:29,383 --> 01:51:30,487
Got to save the world.

1615
01:51:31,785 --> 01:51:33,696
I'll be right back.

1616
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:36,066
Good luck!

1617
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:43,739
London.

1618
01:52:12,326 --> 01:52:13,270
Rio.

1619
01:52:29,343 --> 01:52:30,185
Get down!

1620
01:52:32,346 --> 01:52:33,188
You did ii!

1621
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:44,702
The glass is not gonna hold long.

1622
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,964
You stay here.

1623
01:52:50,197 --> 01:52:51,369
Merlin, quickly,
how do I get up there?

1624
01:52:51,698 --> 01:52:53,609
- Keep shooting, I'll find a route.
- Understood.

1625
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:11,254
Holy fuck!

1626
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:31,078
We're back up.

1627
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:33,246
We're back up!

1628
01:53:40,247 --> 01:53:41,954
This is great!

1629
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:50,932
Eggsy!

1630
01:53:51,091 --> 01:53:52,627
Fucking get on with it!

1631
01:53:52,793 --> 01:53:53,999
Kick his ass, Gazy!

1632
01:54:00,634 --> 01:54:03,444
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai!

1633
01:54:11,812 --> 01:54:14,292
Kill that motherfucker!
He killed all our friends!

1634
01:54:31,665 --> 01:54:33,667
Eggsy,
the world is going to shit!

1635
01:54:43,043 --> 01:54:45,148
- Is he dead yet?
- Not yet!

1636
01:54:45,312 --> 01:54:47,383
Stop playing with your food!

1637
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:48,548
Kill him!

1638
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,071
Gazelle!

1639
01:56:09,896 --> 01:56:11,068
Gazelle!

1640
01:56:20,674 --> 01:56:22,415
Come on!
Come on!

1641
01:56:25,412 --> 01:56:26,083
Kill him!

1642
01:56:43,697 --> 01:56:44,368
Hey!

1643
01:57:09,456 --> 01:57:10,958
Well done, son!

1644
01:57:12,292 --> 01:57:13,236
Yes!

1645
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:14,565
Yes, Eggsy!

1646
01:57:14,728 --> 01:57:16,298
Well done, Eggsy!

1647
01:57:16,796 --> 01:57:17,968
And you, Lancelot.

1648
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:23,306
I'm so sorry.
Mummy would never hurt you.

1649
01:57:23,904 --> 01:57:26,976
Mummy would never hurt you.
I'm so sorry.

1650
01:57:29,476 --> 01:57:30,477
Are you okay?

1651
01:57:34,247 --> 01:57:36,158
Harry would be
proud of you, Eggsy.

1652
01:57:37,484 --> 01:57:38,554
He was right.

1653
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,274
What's up, man?

1654
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:59,014
Is this the pan where you say
some really bad pun?

1655
01:58:00,507 --> 01:58:02,509
Well, it's like you said to Harry.

1656
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:08,023
This ain't that kind of movie, bruv.

1657
01:58:09,516 --> 01:58:10,927
Perfect.

1658
01:58:31,805 --> 01:58:32,977
Eggsy, where are you going?

1659
01:58:33,139 --> 01:58:35,278
There's no need for champagne.
We got loads in the plane.

1660
01:58:42,549 --> 01:58:43,619
Did you save the world?

1661
01:58:44,217 --> 01:58:45,662
Yes, I did.

1662
01:58:46,987 --> 01:58:49,797
So, you gonna come in?

1663
01:58:50,557 --> 01:58:52,059
Yes, l am.

1664
01:58:57,497 --> 01:58:59,408
Merlin, the cell's locked.
How do I get in'?

1665
01:59:01,668 --> 01:59:03,238
26-25.

1666
01:59:07,574 --> 01:59:10,145
Merlin, you're the guvnor.

1667
01:59:12,345 --> 01:59:14,757
You awe me, Eggsy.

1668
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:21,423
Eggsy?

1669
01:59:27,427 --> 01:59:29,100
Oh, my word.

1670
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:19,153
Michelle, turn that shit off.
It's doing my nut in.

1671
02:00:20,146 --> 02:00:21,648
I rather like that song.

1672
02:00:22,182 --> 02:00:23,752
Leave it on,
eh, Mum?

1673
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,431
Mugsy's back.

1674
02:00:29,556 --> 02:00:31,593
You've finally come
to have that word with me, have you, son?

1675
02:00:32,358 --> 02:00:33,666
Or are you gonna run away again...

1676
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:35,397
and pretend you're going to court,
dressed like that?

1677
02:00:35,862 --> 02:00:37,239
Oh, you mean this?

1678
02:00:38,765 --> 02:00:40,073
No.

1679
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:44,011
I know this bloke who's just taken over
a tailor shop on Savile Row.

1680
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:46,675
He's given me a job, Mum.

1681
02:00:47,373 --> 02:00:48,681
It comes with a lot of perks.

1682
02:00:50,043 --> 02:00:51,386
Including a house.

1683
02:00:52,545 --> 02:00:54,388
Come and live with me there, Mum.

1684
02:00:54,948 --> 02:00:56,052
Come on.

1685
02:00:56,216 --> 02:00:56,921
Sit down, you.

1686
02:00:58,351 --> 02:01:00,524
Only place she'll be visiting
is you in fucking hospital.

1687
02:01:00,687 --> 02:01:02,462
- Do you hear?
- Just leave him alone, Dean!

1688
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:04,898
Eggsy, just go
Please, just go, babe.

1689
02:01:06,359 --> 02:01:07,633
All right.

1690
02:01:07,794 --> 02:01:09,364
That's it,
do as Mummy says.

1691
02:01:09,529 --> 02:01:12,373
Why don't you ask that tailor friend of yours,
and knock up a nice chicken costume.

1692
02:01:12,532 --> 02:01:13,909
It'll suit you,
you mug.

1693
02:01:16,136 --> 02:01:18,946
As a good friend once said...

1694
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,378
"Manners...

1695
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:24,254
"maketh...

1696
02:01:26,813 --> 02:01:27,814
"man ll

1697
02:01:28,715 --> 02:01:31,059
- Dean?
- Shut the fuck up.

1698
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:33,629
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove your manners
up your fucking..

1699
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:40,468
So...

1700
02:01:40,827 --> 02:01:44,832
are we gonna stand around here all day,
or are we gonna fight?
