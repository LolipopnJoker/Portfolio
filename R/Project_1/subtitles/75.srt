1
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:47,924
So I get this phone call, July 30th, 2005,
from Steven Spielberg.

2
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,134
He calls me up in his jovial self
and he says,

3
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,429
"Michael, I want you to direct
this movie called <i>Transformers.</i>"

4
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,849
I'm like, "Okay, Steven, well,
that sounds great.

5
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,477
"Let me think about it,
and I'll get back to you."

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,645
I hung up the phone

7
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,564
and in the 30 seconds
everything that goes through your brain.

8
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:08,152
"Is that that little robot toy movie?"
"Is that like a <i>Small Soldiers</i> movie?"

9
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:11,405
"That was just Steven Spielberg
calling me up. Oh, my God!"

10
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,824
"This is one of my idols,
wants me to direct a movie

11
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,618
"that he wants to be involved in."

12
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,827
So I thought about it.

13
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,164
I called Adam Goodman,
president of the studio at DreamWorks.

14
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,083
I said, "Adam, so what is this
<i>Transformers</i> movie?"

15
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,001
He goes, "Why don't you think about it?"

16
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,128
Adam convinced me
to go to Transformer school,

17
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,339
which is in Hasbro in Rhode Island.

18
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,424
And I'm like,
"Okay, well, let's make the trek."

19
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,052
So the next morning
we went into Hasbro.

20
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:37,181
You pass this hallway of all
the famous toys we all grew up with.

21
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,141
We sat in this big conference room.

22
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,477
I mean, they must have had
25 people in there,

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,064
all trying to convince me
to do <i>Transformers,</i>

24
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,857
and they started with
Transformer school

25
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:49,986
which is, they basically take you
through the entire lore of Transformers.

26
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,947
Now, I have been offered a lot of
comic book, superhero movies

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,616
in my short film career.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,953
And I have always said no
because it really hasn't appealed to me.

29
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:04,041
But one thing I did spark to recently
was Japanese anime movies.

30
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,671
I just love their visuals.
It's just a really unique type of cartoon.

31
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:12,258
And I'm sitting in this Transformer,
I guess, like, lecture.

32
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:16,178
I kept looking at this artwork
of just a multitude of images

33
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,015
and there was something
from this Japanese artist.

34
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:24,395
He had some amazingly dark,
cool images that...

35
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,731
That just right there in the room
inspired me.

36
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,859
I kept thinking to myself,
"I need to make this very real.

37
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,235
"I need to make this cool."

38
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,405
I kept thinking about cars transforming
at 80 miles an hour.

39
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:38,826
Action images would just kind of
come to my mind,

40
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,620
of, like, "Why would I be interested
in doing this movie?"

41
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:43,497
I did like the lore of Transformers.

42
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,167
It's very noble, it's got good morals,
it's interesting.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,377
But it's like,
how do you make <i>Transformers</i>

44
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,837
understandable to an adult

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,506
who has no knowledge
of what Transformer toys are?

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,843
We broadened the story in terms
of bringing in the American military.

47
00:02:55,926 --> 00:03:00,639
It's this big story, but it kind of
comes down to this little story on Earth,

48
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:03,893
which is all about Sam
and having these glasses.

49
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:08,272
This is kind of how the birth
of <i>Transformers</i> happened.

50
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,653
I have always had the lucky fortune
of working with military equipment

51
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:18,074
before anybody else,
such as these Ospreys right here.

52
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,618
They have never been used in a movie,

53
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:27,792
and I don't think many people
have shot that Stealth 117 either.

54
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,752
So I've got this hotline to the Pentagon.

55
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:35,132
I've got this relationship with
the film liaison, Phil Strub,

56
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:40,388
who helped me on <i>Armageddon</i>
where we worked with the Air Force.

57
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:44,016
And <i>Pearl Harbor,</i> where we worked
with the Navy and all the branches.

58
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,604
And I called Phil up and I said,
"Phil, I'm gonna be doing this movie.

59
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,565
"It's a fantasy movie
called <i>Transformers.</i>"

60
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,651
And he goes, "Oh, the kids' toy, huh?"

61
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:57,905
He said, "Well, Mike, you know,
if we did have alien robots on Earth,

62
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,074
"I think the American military
would be involved.

63
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,201
"And we will bring the fight
anywhere we have to.

64
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,121
"So let me read the script.
I'm excited to read it."

65
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:11,752
And I guess the rest is history.
He loved it.

66
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,338
And then it's a matter
of me going to different bases

67
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:20,010
and trying to convince bases
to be... Imitate Qatar,

68
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,265
which is the forward command
for the whole Middle East.

69
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:28,352
And we found Holloman Air Force Base
in New Mexico,

70
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,479
which kind of has these white sands

71
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:34,859
which are test missile ranges
for, I think, the Army.

72
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,489
Right here, this was done at Edwards.
These are two F-22s,

73
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,743
which are the brand-new planes
that are costing $130 million each.

74
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,873
They can take out six F-16s
before they can even be spotted.

75
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,791
They are just deadly lethal,

76
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,544
and of course,
I was the first to use those as well.

77
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,006
Why does the military
let me use this stuff?

78
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,426
Because they look good at what they do
in my movies.

79
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,890
And working with
these men and women...

80
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,351
You know, I have done many years of
working with them, in movies,

81
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:13,230
and, you know,
they are really great people.

82
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,648
And they're really dedicated.

83
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:21,197
And I really admire them for the service
they do for the country.

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,617
And, you know,
they don't work for a great wage,

85
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:28,746
but they're just so dedicated
to the country and...

86
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:34,251
You know, so, like, just diligent
and just, you know...

87
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,671
I find many of them so intelligent,

88
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:43,511
and it's always been a great experience
when I've worked on these bases.

89
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,805
And I really have fond memories of it.

90
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,892
And very much, they're impressed
with our film industry

91
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,478
because we work very much
like the military works,

92
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,732
in terms of the different hierarchy and
how it works on our sets and crews.

93
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,401
And they are always very sceptical
when we show up,

94
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,362
because they think we're going to be
a bunch of Hollywood...

95
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,697
But they always come away with,
I'm sure, with a great respect.

96
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:04,949
And they tell us that,

97
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,118
that they come away
with a great respect for what we do,

98
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,455
because they see it so similar
to the military.

99
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,885
So this was our first
transformation here.

100
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,431
And the transformation was...
"How are we gonna do this, basically?"

101
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,476
I had my animators
do rough versions of it.

102
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,271
But when we had this first version up...

103
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,023
That was the very first version
I ever saw of that transformation.

104
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,193
And it was done by an artist
named Keiji.

105
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,488
He's Japanese.
He speaks like no English.

106
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:48,951
He is the absolute Rubik's Cube genius
to figure those things out,

107
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:52,997
of how those parts actually move
and come together.

108
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:58,502
I met Keiji in a very odd meeting
at Industrial Light and Magic.

109
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:04,925
I had about 30 ILM artists sitting
in a kind of hi-def room

110
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,969
where we are looking at the artwork

111
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,889
that my illustrators had worked
for months,

112
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,183
I mean we're talking eight months, on.

113
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:17,146
And then I saw Optimus Prime's face
in his first 3-D kind of,

114
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,399
I guess, iteration of him.

115
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,528
He looked terrible.
He had this fat, ugly face.

116
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,989
And I'm like,
"You guys got to be kidding me.

117
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,325
"This is awful.
What happened to Optimus?"

118
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:35,664
And all of a sudden, in this small room,
this guy pops up in the back,

119
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:40,252
and he goes, "That Optimus Prime
is an insult to the Japanese people.

120
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,172
"That is an insult to the Japanese,
I want to do Optimus Prime."

121
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,591
But you can tell someone else
was obviously modelling

122
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:49,553
Optimus Prime's fat, ugly face
and Keiji knew this.

123
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:53,265
And so I said, "Keiji, first of all,
this is the most bizarre meeting

124
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,226
"I have ever been to, the biggest,
funniest outbreak I have ever seen,

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,478
"and you know what,
just because of that,

126
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,813
"I'm gonna let you work
on Optimus Prime."

127
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,942
So not only did Keiji do Optimus Prime
in terms of the 3-D modelling,

128
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,904
but he did the amazing Rubik's Cube

129
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,825
of how we were going to transform
these robots.

130
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,501
What the military is very
concerned of when they do movies

131
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,544
is that they just want things
to be accurate.

132
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,089
They are very into, like, those uniforms.

133
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,300
If they are not Qatar-issue uniforms,
we just can't use them.

134
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,594
Right here, I shot this
in the Tank Graveyard.

135
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,847
These are old tanks, some are just
kind of shells of other tanks,

136
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,600
where they actually put them out
in the field,

137
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,311
in this white sand,
and they use them as target-practise.

138
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:48,028
We actually started the shoot,
the very first day was...

139
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:52,950
I shot this little, I guess, Mars rover.
I shot that.

140
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,326
I got it assembled because I had
this idea for a teaser

141
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,497
that was the very first teaser
that came out the summer

142
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:02,167
where we just began to start...
We just started shooting.

143
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:07,923
I just wanted to mark our date
of July 4th and to say we were real.

144
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,301
The very first day
of pre-production photography,

145
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,721
I shot in the Tank Graveyard.

146
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,141
My first days really never suck,
but this one really sucked.

147
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,518
I get to the set, I'm all excited,

148
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,020
and I'm walking around
with my viewfinder, ready to go.

149
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:25,107
And I get on set an hour before call

150
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,902
and the hour passes and then I'm
waiting, "Okay, where's my crew?"

151
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,779
I'm like, "This isn't good."

152
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,407
My crew apparently
was just eating dinner.

153
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,786
And normally when you get to set,
you show up,

154
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,705
you either eat dinner before...

155
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,585
So my cameraman, Mitchell Amundsen,
my operators, everyone's eating.

156
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,714
And I'm like, "Okay."
And that pissed me off, the first night.

157
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,341
So I'm like, "Mitch, this is a big movie,

158
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,594
"and you're not going to be
eating your burritos any more

159
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,763
"when I show up to set
and I'm ready to work."

160
00:09:55,846 --> 00:10:01,769
So I think that kind of shook the ground
of everyone, the first night.

161
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,021
Because I got to tell you,
when I come on the set

162
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,940
I'm like, I come in...
They joke on the set,

163
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,400
"Bay's coming in hot."

164
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,945
It means I like to work.
I don't like to fart around,

165
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,742
and everyone knows
that I do a lot of set-ups every day.

166
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:21,997
An average on a movie is 19 to 25.
I do 50, 60, sometimes 75.

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,041
And these are real set-ups.

168
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:30,255
And I shot a lot of this movie
very, kind of, suburbia.

169
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,052
But I didn't kind of sex it up
in terms of making this slick.

170
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,430
This is a classroom that we all
know about, we have all been to.

171
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:44,228
And it's something that makes it
more accessible, I think, to everybody.

172
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,982
And like, I have never in my life
ever shot in a Burger King.

173
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,319
But you know what? We all eat at
Burger King or McDonald's or whatever,

174
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,822
and it just makes it more everyday life.

175
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,491
And I kind of like this, kind of,
sci-fi movie

176
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,285
coupled with this suburbia life.

177
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,288
I thought it was a good mix.

178
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,499
And casting Shia...

179
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,502
I actually started to look for kids
and I had...

180
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:15,384
My casting ladies scoured the Earth for
the best 16, 17, 18, 19, 20-year-old kid

181
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,095
that can play a 16-year-old out there.

182
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,931
And we looked from London to Australia
to Canada,

183
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,769
and Ian Bryce was the first to mention
to me Shia LaBeouf.

184
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,856
Or "LaBoof." I call him "Shia LeBuff."

185
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,400
I said, "Well, I saw him in <i>Constantine,</i>

186
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,151
"and I have never seen the movie <i>Holes,</i>

187
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,446
"but in <i>Constantine</i> he was playing
a cab driver. He looked a little old."

188
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:42,536
So the kid came in,
and he was kind of skinny

189
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,832
and, like, a little goofy
and way over-excited.

190
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,667
I'm like,
"Dude, you got to calm down here,

191
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,379
"you're just auditioning with me
at my office."

192
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,300
And he goes, "Wow, I just... I want
to be an action guy and I want to be a...

193
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,344
"It's just like, wow, I love your movies
and I can't believe I'm meeting you."

194
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:04,182
I'm like, "All right, calm down,
let's just do the audition."

195
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:11,440
And I just instantly liked his energy
in the audition.

196
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:16,028
You know, we had some of our early,
early written pages,

197
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,364
where the dialogue really needed to be
tweaked and made more real.

198
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,534
And sometimes it's actually good
to read with some clunky dialogue,

199
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,745
and you see how actors
could fare through,

200
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,123
because a good actor can make
any line sound good.

201
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,377
And Spielberg will even tell you that.

202
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,297
That's the art of acting, in a way.

203
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,341
But I started throwing some stuff
to Shia,

204
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,552
like improv-ing with him a bit
in the audition.

205
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,639
My thing is I love finding actors
that can improv

206
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:48,060
because a lot of my film-making,
we improv as we go.

207
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,312
I mean, we have the basis of the scene.

208
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:55,025
I mean, I kind of learned this on working
with Martin and Will on <i>Bad Boys.</i>

209
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,277
Shia just had this great thing.

210
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:02,240
And, you know, I called Steven,
and I said, "I met with Shia."

211
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:07,162
And Steven goes, "I love Shia."
So he was all excited about that.

212
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:11,500
And I said, "Well, I really want
to show you this tape."

213
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,712
I went downstairs and because
I had auditioned a couple of other kids

214
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:22,469
and he just was heads and tails
above every other kid that came in.

215
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,596
And I asked the girls in the office,

216
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,765
my assistants who are very blunt,
I said,

217
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,975
"So what do you think of him?"

218
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,395
I said, "Just watch the DVD,
watch his thing."

219
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,981
They saw and they go like,
"Oh, my God, he's great, he's great.

220
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:37,025
"He's so funny, he's so charming,
he's so funny."

221
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,444
So I sent the audition to Steven,

222
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,446
and then I called Shia back.

223
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,702
And meanwhile I had to make
this movie for a price.

224
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,538
And I actually do some
of my own actor deals

225
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:53,333
because when I make a movie
for a price, I make it for a price.

226
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:57,587
So I have to play a tough guy and
I say, "Basically, if you want the part,

227
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,466
"you got 24 hours to decide.
This is what we are going to pay you.

228
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,885
"Yes or no, give me an answer
in 24 hours."

229
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:08,140
So sometimes that's the only way
to get a deal done.

230
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:12,477
I must say, I'm very proud of the fact

231
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,730
that we made this movie
for $150,000,000.

232
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,982
But I'll go into that later, okay?

233
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:24,322
But Shia, I guess he was
my first snag on the cast.

234
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:28,577
And from there it followed to Jon Voight

235
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,082
and then the amazing John Turturro,
who I had always wanted to work with.

236
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,878
I originally thought of Steve Buscemi,
but Steve was busy directing something,

237
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:41,882
because I love working with Steve and
Turturro is someone I've always loved.

238
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,301
Me being such a huge
Coen Brothers fan.

239
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:48,847
It's like, anyone who can bowl
and have a rose in their bowling ball,

240
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,391
I got to work with that guy.

241
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,187
From there we kind of went on
to get our female,

242
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,651
and I looked at a lot of females.
It was a very hard role to cast

243
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,739
and Megan Fox is someone
we auditioned for a movie

244
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,826
I produced for Platinum Dunes
for <i>Amityville Horror.</i>

245
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:16,750
And I remembered her
and my casting ladies brought her in.

246
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,669
I said I wanted to see her
because I really liked her look.

247
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:24,591
And in person she's very, kind of,
timid and shy. She's from Tennessee.

248
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,053
She had a sweetness about her,
and I knew I had to make her tough.

249
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,598
And she was very new at acting.

250
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,894
But I just liked something about her.

251
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,480
There was something
that was more exciting to work

252
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:44,027
with an actress who is fresh
and not done a lot of movies.

253
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:49,199
And so I had Shia come in
and work with her.

254
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:54,704
And we did several auditions with her

255
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:59,501
and working with Megan,
she was so timid in the beginning,

256
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:04,297
just being on this big, massive set.

257
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,051
But there was a good kind of chemistry
between her and Shia.

258
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,594
Shia was able to really lighten her up,

259
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,097
and there were times
I really had to make her tough.

260
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,934
And every actor has a button
you got to push once in a while,

261
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,062
and you got to figure out what that
button is when you're directing them.

262
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:23,316
And her button was... Because I couldn't
get her to emote tough enough

263
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,738
when she was, like, cutting
that little robot in half with a saw.

264
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,951
And it just was looking way too girly,
way un-tough.

265
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,204
And I'm like, "Megan, remember
I told you when you got this part,

266
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,873
"you had to be tough."

267
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,501
And she told me she would hang out
with mechanics or whatever

268
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,629
to get this movie part.

269
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:48,425
Finally, her button was, I said, "Megan,
we have so much money on this movie,

270
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,053
"we will stay here all night long
to get this one shot.

271
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:56,391
"I don't care if we stay here 15 hours,
we're gonna shoot it all night long.

272
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,144
"Because you will hate this shot
right now.

273
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,104
"Come here, look at the monitor."

274
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,191
And all of a sudden that would get
her angry. It would get her pissed.

275
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,569
And that was her button where
she was able to really give me...

276
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,738
Like emote, and whatnot.

277
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:16,077
So anyway, I just thought she had
a good thing with her and Shia.

278
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,247
And Shia was able
to really throw a lot of things at her.

279
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:22,334
And, you know, her problem
was with his improv,

280
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,046
she just kept laughing through
the takes. So that wasn't good.

281
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,840
Many of the times we had to CG
her face out when she was laughing.

282
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,509
No, I'm kidding, we didn't.

283
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:36,723
Mojo, the dog, was kind of like an idea...

284
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,100
I just love dogs and like...

285
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,937
You know what,
a dog addicted to pain pills with a cast,

286
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,605
that's just funny.

287
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:48,068
So I said to the writers, I said,
"Let's put a dog named Mojo."

288
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,531
So I auditioned a bunch of Chihuahuas.

289
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:58,078
And this one was, I guess,
by far the best one.

290
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:02,374
Then I thought,
what better than having a Chihuahua

291
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,917
that's stoned eating pain pills,

292
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,796
that hobbles up on his little penthouse
of a birdhouse.

293
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:11,299
So you can imagine when I'm telling
the art department,

294
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,177
"I want to build this little silly,
little doghouse,

295
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,971
"but it's elevated."

296
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,806
Well, this gives the movie audience
a laugh,

297
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,641
because that's just funny.

298
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,398
Right here, the dad right here,
this is my best friend,

299
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,776
Robert Offer, who's my lawyer,
who I have known since nursery school.

300
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,528
He has a problem with his kids.

301
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,530
He doesn't let his kids
walk on his grass.

302
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,159
And I have always... I save things up
that I learn in life for movies.

303
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,787
And I'm like, "What neurotic dad

304
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,956
"doesn't let their kids
walk on his own grass?"

305
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,792
Well, this is Robert Offer right now.

306
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:51,339
And this right here
is complete improv, where...

307
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,259
This is an example of how

308
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,430
we were playing around
with Kevin Dunn and Julie White,

309
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,434
this amazing mom who just actually
won a Tony. A Tony award.

310
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:38,822
This is a scene where for Shia,
you know, our character Sam...

311
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,699
This is an experience where every guy
has had this experience,

312
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,493
where the tough guy comes up

313
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:47,372
and kind of tries to embarrass you
in front of his friends.

314
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:52,669
This moment right here
is the moment where

315
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,838
I think every guy first of all identifies
with him.

316
00:20:54,921 --> 00:21:01,719
But you like him instantly because he's
able to come back with comedy and wit.

317
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,057
This guy, John, right here,
he jumps up on this tree

318
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,892
and I'm like, "Wait a minute,
that's great, that's funny.

319
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,019
"I mean, what kind of kooky-ass
friend would hang on a tree

320
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,688
"and make this kid embarrassed?"

321
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,690
So I wasn't gonna
make this kid the geek,

322
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,191
because I didn't want the geek.

323
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,486
I wanted the geek who was sharp,
who was witty

324
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,238
but was able to come back with humour.

325
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,616
And right here with this whole
"colouring book" thing,

326
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,036
this is, I think, where you kind of
fall in love with this kid.

327
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,508
People were very worried
about the tone of this movie,

328
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,594
where it was very edgy and hard

329
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:47,390
and then it had these funny
kind of suburbia touches.

330
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:52,270
And, you know, that's the thing
that everyone talks about,

331
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,147
the tone of the movie.
They love the tone of the movie,

332
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,900
and that's what, around the world,
when I did press for this movie,

333
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,111
everyone talks about the tone
and how funny it is.

334
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:04,032
And, you know, that's just kind of
what I like doing.

335
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,494
It's my thing.

336
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,164
So when I signed on to do this movie,

337
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:56,668
God, there was a lot of talk
on the Internet about,

338
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,838
"Michael Bay will wreck this movie,
he won't know how to do this movie.

339
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:05,093
"He doesn't know anything
about Transformers."

340
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:13,226
You know, stuff like,
"Michael Bay is wrecking my childhood."

341
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,771
"Death to Michael Bay." Boy, I had
a lot of death threats, I must say.

342
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,274
They even actually protested
at one of my offices,

343
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,026
but it was an office I had moved out of
two years prior,

344
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,698
so, you know, I guess they weren't that
smart, to figure out where to protest.

345
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,160
But I remember listening to stuff
on the Internet.

346
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:36,082
I would listen to some of their ideas
that they would talk about,

347
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,543
because fan support is very important,

348
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:43,673
and I wanted them to be happy
with <i>Transformers.</i>

349
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,092
But I was trying to introduce
a world of people

350
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,928
that have never seen <i>Transformers</i>
to this movie.

351
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:56,144
And, I think, in a way, it was better
that I wasn't a Transformer fan,

352
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,606
because I was able to make this movie
more accessible

353
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,775
to the non-fan, I guess.

354
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:07,739
So I must say right now,
I am a true Transformer fan.

355
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,366
I have probably thought about robots

356
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,744
more than anybody
in the past year and a half.

357
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,871
And probably... I thought about robots

358
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,624
more than anybody else on Earth
for the past year and a half.

359
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,919
We would have artwork that would leak.

360
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:25,173
I mean, it was truly one of the most
sought-after movies

361
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:29,594
and talked about on the Internet
than I can remember in a very long time.

362
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:34,515
Our art server had 39,000
attempted hacks

363
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,103
in the month of January,
in the year 2006.

364
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:45,902
And we had to literally get, like, almost
Pentagon-type quality encryption.

365
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,949
And they actually personally hacked
into my personal computer.

366
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:56,120
And they were able to steal one script.

367
00:24:56,204 --> 00:25:00,708
We know who stole it,
and I was able to get the script back.

368
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,211
But luckily it only got out once.

369
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:08,424
So there were so many leaks that
I decided to actually keep the script...

370
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,681
Just literally, I had the only
original script in my computer.

371
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:21,771
And certain actors
had ones that were older

372
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,523
and everyone had coded scripts.

373
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,150
And we collected all the scripts
from the crew.

374
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,695
We gave them out and they gave it back

375
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,488
and all those different measures.

376
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,031
And there was one script,
a very old script

377
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,700
that got out on the Internet
that everyone read,

378
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,910
and everyone kept
commenting on, and...

379
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:38,579
But it was so old, scripts can change.

380
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:41,207
In a month you can change
so much in a script.

381
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,127
And theirs was, like,
probably five months

382
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,422
older than what the script
was in the movie.

383
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:51,008
I mean, we had...
In case the script got out,

384
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:54,679
we had names of our robots,
a.k.a. names.

385
00:25:54,762 --> 00:26:01,352
But there were many characters
that I tried to create.

386
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,063
Like, let me give you an example.
We were working on this movie,

387
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:07,108
budgeting this movie
and they have to make these toys,

388
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,778
like moulds and like the idea
of these type of moulds,

389
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,281
a year and a half out.
We didn't even have a script

390
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,866
and Ian Bryce came to me and says,

391
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:20,121
"Hasbro needs to know
what Transformer vehicles

392
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,874
"and what are you using
for the Decepticons?

393
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,376
"Autobots and Decepticons.
What kind of cars?"

394
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,670
And I'm, like, literally had to come
to a choice with, like,

395
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,714
"Okay, I think, maybe a tank.

396
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:36,012
"I don't know if we can get that amazing
bomb-searching Buffalo truck,

397
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,056
"that's brand new,
that they are sending to Iraq,

398
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,143
"if we can maybe do that one.

399
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,898
"I definitely, if I can get an F-22,
but I don't know if we can get an F-22."

400
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,235
So that's how we kind of had to decide.
We had to decide very quickly.

401
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:29,917
I also wanted to make other characters,
like in the boom box on Air Force One.

402
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,919
I like this kind of character,

403
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:33,671
and I think, if we do <i>Transformers 2,</i>

404
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,382
we're gonna have a lot more
unique characters,

405
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,217
like this but also bigger.

406
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,512
And just, you can imagine
where the mind can go here.

407
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,932
I mean, I designed some...

408
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:48,060
With the artists,
some amazingly huge characters

409
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:52,023
who just got to be too big, too costly,
too expensive, whatever.

410
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,734
And it was Steven who said,

411
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,445
"You know what? We should probably
just keep this kind of like

412
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:00,615
"six against five or something,
where it's a little bit more manageable."

413
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,117
And I think he's right
that we keep it smaller

414
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,786
to kind of try to introduce
what's going on here.

415
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,929
Steven says I saved 30 grand right there
by doing that little one camera move.

416
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:27,391
We had a guy grab the boom box.
He's right. So I saved an effect.

417
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:35,733
Then right in here, this is our actually
full-scale puppet of this... Frenzy here.

418
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:56,379
Frenzy was animated by a French artist

419
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,839
at ILM.

420
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:03,052
I liked this very quirky
kind of movement.

421
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,098
And when I was directing the animation,

422
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,766
because I would actually
every single day,

423
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,142
I would work with animators

424
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,395
where they would send me down
what they are working on

425
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,523
so that I can actually direct them,

426
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,068
you know, after these shots that...
We have done these plate shots

427
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,945
and try to direct their acting.

428
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:24,281
I got to tell these characters so well

429
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:28,536
that I knew that when another artist
was working on this Frenzy character,

430
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,039
he wasn't the French guy.

431
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,084
I'm like, "Well, did you guys have
a different animator working on this?"

432
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:39,213
They are like... You hear them kind of
over the conference call, "Yeah."

433
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,007
So I'm like, "You got to put
the French guy back on,

434
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,217
"because it's a total different character."

435
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,681
You know, and he says, "He's on
another movie, he's working on <i>Pirates.</i>"

436
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,516
I said, "Well, you got to get
the French guy back.

437
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,518
"Whatever you got to do,
you got to get the French guy back."

438
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:36,395
My theory on effects, well,
it all comes down to lighting.

439
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:40,357
And I feel everyone in their brain

440
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,527
has something that we don't really
know that's there,

441
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:46,072
but we can tell when something
is not lit right.

442
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,531
We don't know why it's there,

443
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,742
but we just know there's something
wrong with the shot,

444
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,952
and it's all coming down to lighting.

445
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,788
Because we are used
to looking at the world

446
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,998
the way we see it through our eyes.

447
00:31:56,082 --> 00:32:00,002
After I did <i>Pearl Harbor,</i>
Dennis Muren said to me...

448
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,213
He says,
"You raised the bar on effects."

449
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,799
And I'm like,
"What did he mean by that?"

450
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:08,928
And he goes, "You have just
made effects more realistic."

451
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:12,556
And the first time I went to ILM,
or used them, was on <i>Pearl Harbor.</i>

452
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,393
And I had a big meeting up there
where I just felt

453
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:20,022
that Lucas' stuff is awesome,
but it's very pastel.

454
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,108
In terms of their light,
it doesn't look real,

455
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:24,693
the shadows aren't dark enough,

456
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,862
it doesn't have enough contrast.

457
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,157
It doesn't have the right ripple
reflections on metal.

458
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:31,784
So that was one
of the big achievements

459
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,452
I think we worked with on <i>Pearl Harbor,</i>

460
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,538
in terms of shooting a movie
at 12:00 noon,

461
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:40,793
and making it, not disguising it in night
and showing it in broad daylight.

462
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,964
And making the planes as real
as possible and all these other ships.

463
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:48,259
And so I think that's what Dennis
was talking about.

464
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:51,512
Well, you know this,
we had to take it to a brand new level,

465
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,640
in terms of trying to make reality here.

466
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,185
So we spent
a tremendous amount of time

467
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,689
and software and just trying
to invent new tricks

468
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,984
on how to light these robots.

469
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,529
They use this process
called ray tracing.

470
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,490
When you look at a car,
you go out on a parking lot...

471
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,659
I've shot a lot of car commercials, so...

472
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,788
I was trying to explain,
you can't just have one quality of light

473
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,915
on a car, on a piece of sheet metal.

474
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,002
It will reflect soft light, hard light

475
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,129
it will have pings, it will have long lines.

476
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,132
Cars are, like, a nightmare to light,

477
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:33,179
in terms of if you're actually doing
a total digital model of a car.

478
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:38,601
So you probably couldn't have done
this movie,

479
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,853
I guess, as of two years ago.

480
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,909
So in terms of our effects,

481
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:58,078
we had Industrial Light and Magic
that were heading up <i>Transformers,</i>

482
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,414
and we had Digital Domain,
which is an effects company

483
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,668
that I recently purchased
with a couple of other partners.

484
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:07,129
Those are the ones that did...

485
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:10,257
Both companies
did the work for this movie.

486
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:16,639
ILM did three-quarters
and Digital Domain did the last quarter.

487
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,516
ILM came down and they talked to me

488
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,728
about something that was used
in <i>Star Wars III.</i>

489
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,147
It was a digital model of a character

490
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:28,776
that was kind of like a robot,
and it was so uncomplicated.

491
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:32,154
I'm like, "Guys, we have to go
so much farther than this."

492
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:36,825
General Grievous was ILM's most
complicated digital model at the time

493
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,119
and it was, if you look at it,
it's so simple

494
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:42,873
compared to the complexity
that we needed to do our models.

495
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:47,044
They talked about these models
which finally, when they were done,

496
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:50,798
Optimus Prime is made of 10,108 parts

497
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,051
that all have to move, not intersect,

498
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:59,348
and it's just an immensely

499
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,935
complicated digital model.

500
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:07,106
They say they're the most complicated
digital models ever made.

501
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:15,614
So this is actually Shia's first night, and
you can see his nappy hair right now.

502
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:16,865
I just kept looking at his hair, I said,

503
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,492
"Dude, we gotta do something
with your hair."

504
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,620
And he says,
"Mike, what's the matter with my hair?"

505
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:24,957
I said, "It just looks nappy.
We gotta make it cooler."

506
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,544
I wasn't allowed to cut it
because he was still shooting <i>Disturbia.</i>

507
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:31,630
And this is his first scene for the movie,

508
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:35,384
and those dogs chasing him
are actually killer police dogs.

509
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,636
And Shia's running,

510
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,056
and there's a man in a big dog suit
who stands behind him,

511
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:43,392
and he was there with a whip,
and he was calling the dogs.

512
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,562
Well, they actually missed the guy
with the big dog suit

513
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:47,896
where they're supposed
to chomp on the arm,

514
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:51,150
and they kept going after Shia.

515
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,235
Shia was almost killed that night,
I am not kidding you.

516
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,738
Thank God he was fast.

517
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:59,992
It wasn't good when the guy with
the whip, he says, "Uh-oh, uh-oh."

518
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,078
The whole crew
started chasing after the dogs

519
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:07,374
with the big chains on their necks,
so we were able to tackle them.

520
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,776
If you have military assistance,
you have to have advisors on the set

521
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,612
that are from the Pentagon
that make sure

522
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,947
that we're doing things correctly.

523
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:43,619
They won't tell us, like, what lines
we have to say and what we can't say,

524
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,621
but it's just gotta be accurate.

525
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,207
When Rachael here
had to go into this room,

526
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,792
I was just gonna have her
slip into the room,

527
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,211
but we had to have this other guy
knock on the window.

528
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:56,382
That was the only way
they were gonna let me do this shot,

529
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,134
because they would say there would
be no way in the Pentagon for her

530
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,553
to slip into a private room like this.

531
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:05,557
So you gotta make these
little concessions here and there.

532
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,312
And I said to the guy, "Are you sure
that would never happen?"

533
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:14,066
"No way, that would be impossible."
"Are you sure?"

534
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,485
"No, that's impossible."

535
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,988
So, okay, I'm, like, "All right, this is
the way we gotta block this scene."

536
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:03,884
This was actually the very first day
of official shooting right here.

537
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,969
New Mexico, White Sands.

538
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,332
The way we made the Skorponoks work

539
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,752
was I remembered
something we did in <i>Armageddon</i>

540
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:43,966
where we did these
primer cord explosions that...

541
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:49,930
Primer cord's like a very stable
kind of explosive device.

542
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,974
It's like rope.

543
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,143
And we put like 150 of these in a row,

544
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:58,063
and they had a computer that was able

545
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,650
to fire milliseconds apart from
each other so it made a ripple effect.

546
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:04,861
And that's how we did this shot
right here with this ripple shooting up

547
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:08,282
and the thing jumping out
right behind them.

548
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,284
I remember doing the animatic
for that shot.

549
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,494
I said, "You know what?
That shot's a trailer shot."

550
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,873
And that was Tyrese's second day

551
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,919
where the guys actually
had to run over a carpet of explosives

552
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,546
as the stuff was fired behind them.

553
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,966
I'm, like, "Guys, do not stop, do not trip,

554
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,343
"and we're gonna fire these things off,

555
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,430
"and this stand's gonna go,
because it will really hurt your foot."

556
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:36,893
So that look is, I guess,
one of fear and real terror, there.

557
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,108
A lot of these guys,
these rangers here, are the real deal.

558
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:48,572
Many of them were very decorated
United States SEALs and Rangers.

559
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,747
This scene right here with Josh

560
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,082
was something that
I remember a real SEAL telling me.

561
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,336
It happened down in Grenada
where they were trapped in a house.

562
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:03,629
They lost all their come,

563
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:07,799
and they had a cell phone
where they had to call to the Pentagon

564
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,636
and literally had to get a credit card
to get out of the country

565
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,973
and link up with an operator at the
Pentagon to get an air strike to come in.

566
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,100
And they had to vector in their position.

567
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:22,814
So something I always held in my ideas
of wanting to get into a movie,

568
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,858
and so this was an idea of making it

569
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,778
kind of fun and serious
at the same time.

570
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,279
I just like the whole chain of events

571
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,324
and how fast you can see
this air strike come in.

572
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:37,079
It's called an Air Force Combat
Controller. That's what Tyrese plays.

573
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:43,210
An Air Force Combat Controller
is a job that a guy can use a gun.

574
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,713
He can help them in battle,
but he's a very important tool

575
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:49,466
in terms of getting
very deadly air support,

576
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,385
which is what they call "danger close,"

577
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:54,346
which is where they'll shoot missiles,

578
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:58,016
and they give a precise position
where the friends are,

579
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,061
and they will give a precise position
where the foes are.

580
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:04,231
And these missiles will sometimes
come in 50 feet, 20 feet,

581
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:07,484
that's why they call it
"danger close" there.

582
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,570
You know, sometimes you think
we're "movie-ising" this thing up

583
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:14,449
where the guys are coming in with,

584
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,952
I guess, those laser-sighting things
on their guns.

585
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,538
That's called marking a target.

586
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:59,202
These guys on the AWACS, that was
done on Edwards Air Force Base.

587
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:02,998
I told these guys on the AWACS...
These are all the real guys.

588
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,418
I said to the guy in charge
of the AWACS, I said,

589
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,544
"How would you run this mission?

590
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:08,920
"This is what's going down
on the ground.

591
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,213
"This is what's happening."

592
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,258
And literally within three minutes,
these guys were talking.

593
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,427
I did not add one line here.

594
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,054
This is exactly how they talked.
That's as fast as they talk.

595
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,682
And, literally, we were capturing it
like a documentary.

596
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:23,685
It's amazing how fast
everyone's talking over each other.

597
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,396
And a multitude of things going on.

598
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:27,731
And what's going on, Josh, right now

599
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:33,653
is laser-designating for these
missiles coming in right now,

600
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:36,281
and that's actually how it's done.

601
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,745
These Warthogs are, I must say,
very, kind of, scary

602
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,791
'cause they've got a very low,
kind of, sound to them

603
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,210
and they get very low to the ground,

604
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:49,753
and they're slow enough
where you can see them

605
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:54,925
and they just got this evil whine to it,
and they're just so deadly, these things.

606
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,986
Skorponok was our first scene
that we shot

607
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,114
and it was one of the first scenes
that was kind of digitally completed.

608
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,995
And that was kind of, I guess, the basis
of how these Transformers should look.

609
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,458
I started showing some of my friends
this scene and everyone kept saying,

610
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,293
"Well, what is it, an animation?
What is it?"

611
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,461
And then I'd show them this scene

612
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,129
and then instantly,
this is a scene they go,

613
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:35,715
"I get it. I understand the movie now."

614
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:39,219
"You're doing this
kind of in a real-life way."

615
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:45,684
And it's got fun, and, you know,
it's kind of sci-fi.

616
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:49,396
So I guess this is when we started
convincing a lot of people.

617
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,190
Like even the Japanese came in,
the Toho distributors.

618
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:56,695
I had to do a lot of dog-and-pony shows
for a lot of people

619
00:44:56,778 --> 00:45:03,493
because we were, I guess, one of the
very few non-sequels of the summer,

620
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:06,371
and we had to
kind of position ourselves.

621
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,622
And a lot of theatre owners,

622
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,417
"Well, what is <i>Transformers?</i>
I don't get it."

623
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,628
So we did this little compilation reel
of 20 minutes,

624
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,340
and it's something that we started
showing around to theatre owners

625
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:22,137
and to try to get people on board,
to understand what we have here.

626
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,180
Because everyone
thought this is, kind of,

627
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,892
"What is it, silly?" "Is it animation?"
Is it this, is it that?

628
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,685
We started showing people this.

629
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,478
Like, for example, Toho,

630
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:34,149
which is the biggest movie
distributor ownership in Japan,

631
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,735
which is a gigantic market.

632
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,279
They came into my trailer,
I showed them 20 minutes of stuff,

633
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,490
and, literally,
you just heard the word...

634
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:44,784
And I guess
that meant "Good" in Japanese.

635
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:46,244
They upped our estimate,

636
00:45:46,328 --> 00:45:49,164
they doubled our estimate
of what we're gonna make in Japan,

637
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,583
and they gave us
the number one house...

638
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,837
Toho, I guess, chain in Japan.

639
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:02,135
But that reel was a way to really
get people on board with this movie,

640
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,557
you know, 'cause I kind of
knew what we had early on,

641
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:12,771
and I remember going in to see
my very first fight in Vegas.

642
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,273
A live fight. It was Oscar de la Hoya.

643
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:20,320
And I walked in and there was
Peter Chernin, who I'm friendly with,

644
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,157
and, you know, good jovial fun,
he's walking in with his friend.

645
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,201
And he goes,
"So, I hear you got <i>Transformers.</i>"

646
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,411
And I said,
"So, I hear you got <i>Die Hard!</i>"

647
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:30,997
And I'm, like,
"Yeah, they're the same date."

648
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:34,584
And I just kind of said,
"Yeah, but you'll move, don't worry."

649
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:36,086
And, of course, they moved.

650
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,546
You know,
it's kind of a game of chicken.

651
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,716
I think they saw our second teaser.

652
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,845
We wanted it to be a hard-edged teaser,
'cause we wanted to show the fans

653
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,974
that we're gonna do
a serious, cool Transformer movie

654
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,767
and we weren't making it too kiddy,

655
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:57,524
and it was going to appeal
to the 30-year-old guy and girl

656
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,652
that, you know,
grew up with <i>Transformers,</i>

657
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:05,782
as well as the younger kids
that are just getting into it.

658
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:31,224
You can tell right here,
I mean this guy, Omar, right there,

659
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,559
he wasn't in the script,

660
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:35,645
but I always add weird stuff like this
right here... Going through glass.

661
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:38,690
Why are we doing that?
I don't know, it's funny, all right?

662
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,734
That's just my humour.

663
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:41,985
So this is where the studio goes,

664
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,655
"What are you doing?
Is this director out of his mind?"

665
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:48,616
But in every single movie theatre,

666
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,370
I've seen it around the world,
they all laugh.

667
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:54,456
You know, what can I tell you?

668
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:11,264
We had $145 million
to make this movie.

669
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,682
It doesn't sound like a lot.

670
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:15,351
I mean, it sounds like a lot,
but it's really not.

671
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:18,313
When you look at some of these movies
like <i>Pirates,</i> which is $350

672
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,024
and <i>Spider-Man</i> which is $325,

673
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:24,736
I don't even know how you spend
that much money on a movie.

674
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,613
I'm really proud of the fact
that we did this movie

675
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:30,283
for ultimately $151 at the end of the day.

676
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,204
We were very judicious
about where we used the effects.

677
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,456
And I must say a lot of that
is attributed to Steven,

678
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,416
'cause Steven would
put the reins on me.

679
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,337
I mean, literally,
Steven is very, very tough about budget.

680
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,592
He wanted me to think really hard
about how many effects I used

681
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,886
and to use them
and choose them wisely.

682
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:53,139
He would say, like,
"Listen, when I did <i>Jurassic Park,</i>

683
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:58,019
"it was only 50-something effects,
and we all remember it as more.

684
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:01,439
"When I did <i>War of the Worlds,</i>
it was only 117 effects."

685
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:04,567
I kind of thought, "Are you kidding?
I would think it'd be more than that."

686
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:08,071
So he really got me to thinking
how to use my effects wisely

687
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,948
'cause they can get very pricey

688
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:13,952
and that's why the budget
can just balloon.

689
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,038
So I literally animaticked the
whole movie, in terms of every scene

690
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,706
where we were gonna do big effects.

691
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,502
Literally, a lot of these effects in
the movie are exactly how we did them

692
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,713
in our little Maya files in my office.

693
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:30,260
I started to get excited about potentially
what I can visually show.

694
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:34,347
Like this shot right here
of Shia going in, this whole scene.

695
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:40,603
A kid on his stupid mom's bike
that is now gonna confront a monster.

696
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,730
I kept thinking this could be a movie...

697
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:45,859
Every kid has to have a movie
that they own, you know.

698
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:49,320
With me growing up, it was like <i>E. T.</i>

699
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:52,490
and really, like, <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>
and <i>Star Wars.</i>

700
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,367
Those were two movies that kind of...

701
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,621
There are seminal moments
in my childhood of cool movies I saw,

702
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:03,418
and that's what I wanted
this movie to be for kids.

703
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,590
You know, it's something new
and different that they can discover.

704
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:09,924
It's not a repeat of something.

705
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:14,846
You know, I can't tell you
how many kids have come up to me

706
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,682
saying, "It's my favourite movie
I've ever seen!

707
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:20,435
"I love <i>Transformers!</i>
I can't wait to see <i>Transformers 2!</i>"

708
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:25,190
You know, this is why you do movies,
and I think people responded to it

709
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,566
because it was kind of
new and different.

710
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:31,821
And, well,
what I'm really surprised about

711
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,200
is the massive age range
this movie had,

712
00:50:35,283 --> 00:50:39,162
from 50, 60-year-olds
to, I mean, young four-year-olds.

713
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,789
I don't get that. I don't see how
four-year-olds can see this movie

714
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:44,751
and not think it's too scary or whatnot.

715
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:48,463
I don't know if I really believe in parents
bringing their kids to a movie like this

716
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:49,631
when they're that young.

717
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:54,302
I think what really inspired me to do
this movie were not only animatics

718
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,720
but the illustrations.

719
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:59,098
The movie started to become more real,
and there's a charm about the movie.

720
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:04,646
I like this whole magic of these two kids
kind of discovering these things.

721
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:13,196
And, you know, my favourite scene,
I think, in this movie is...

722
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,701
It's kind of ironic. Thinking back,
it's like all my movies, like, first hour in,

723
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:21,579
there was always one montage.
That kind of...

724
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,249
You can kind of see this
in all my movies like <i>The Rock.</i>

725
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,584
Sean Connery and Nic Cage
breaking in into the Rock,

726
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:31,256
and then <i>Armageddon,</i>
the astronauts lifting off

727
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:36,177
or <i>Pearl Harbor,</i> the Japanese
kind of getting ready to attack

728
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:42,141
or the asteroids coming in and landing
and the kids meeting the Autobots.

729
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:46,187
I kind of have a theme,
I guess, in my movies.

730
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:50,400
I do these montages
that really inspire me,

731
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,194
and they always seem
to happen an hour in.

732
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:54,737
But that's kind of my favourite scene,

733
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:58,658
when we see Optimus
kind of transform in front of the kids.

734
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,041
So when we're doing scenes like this,

735
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,752
I'm sometimes, often times,
in the car with Shia and Megan,

736
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:11,629
and we're driving with the stunt driver,

737
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:13,589
and we're driving
very fast and controlled,

738
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:17,969
but it really gets your adrenalin going,
I must say.

739
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:53,546
Shia always says I'm the director
that will put my knee pads on,

740
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:56,632
I'll be right next to the actors.

741
00:52:56,716 --> 00:53:01,137
When I do action...
Oh, God, you hear these rumours.

742
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,014
It's the kind they love
to just get onto the...

743
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:06,976
"Michael yells." "Michael's a screamer."
Blah, blah, blah.

744
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:12,190
No, Michael's like
a tough-ass basketball coach

745
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,276
that is in your face,
especially when you're doing action.

746
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,736
For one, because of safety,

747
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,447
two, because I'm trying
to get your adrenalin level

748
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,658
where I think it needs to be
for that scene.

749
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:24,077
How many action scenes do you see

750
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,289
where it seems like actors
are just kind of walking through it?

751
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:32,418
I really want that adrenalin to be real,
and I want you to look energised.

752
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:36,422
So that's kind of how I work, you know?

753
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:42,595
So the screaming only comes, I guess,
when I'm doing tough action,

754
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:45,390
and I want you to get
to that energy level, you know.

755
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:48,768
And it's also, a lot of these times,

756
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:53,314
I'm very safety-conscious,
and I take it personally,

757
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:56,025
and I'm like my own A.D. on my sets.

758
00:53:56,109 --> 00:54:01,823
I work with an A.D.,
I worked with Simon this time,

759
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:06,786
but I move my sets forward for myself,

760
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:10,498
and I want everyone to know
what I'm thinking and I'm vocal about it.

761
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,417
Like, "We're moving over here!
We're coming over here!"

762
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,254
And so I've got a good projecting voice
that, you know, like,

763
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,590
"Let's get our day done,
and let's, like, do it."

764
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:23,094
Granted, I like to laugh
just like the next guy, and I tease.

765
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,680
I am a professional teaser
with my crew.

766
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:28,599
And it's funny when you see
new crew members come on.

767
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,601
They're day players,
whatever, and I'm teasing,

768
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:34,355
'cause I'll act it like I really mean it.

769
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,524
I'm totally screwing around with people,

770
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,777
but my crew that's been
with me for 16 years,

771
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:42,363
they all know that
I'm screwing around with you.

772
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,450
But I like picking on people,
and I like being picked on, too,

773
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,786
just as long as you're good
at picking on people. It's fun.

774
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,373
But I do like to have
a good environment on the set

775
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:57,462
and especially work with people
that I really like being around

776
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:02,842
that look at it as a career, not as a job.

777
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,304
Because, let me tell you,
I know everyone's job on this set.

778
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:09,891
I've been doing this since I'm 24,

779
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:13,644
and I will be the first to point out to you
when you're not doing a good job.

780
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,314
But you know what?

781
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,235
A director's only as good
as his or her crew,

782
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,574
and the studio wanted to ship me off
to Australia, then to Canada.

783
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,994
We went to check out Canada.
I felt Australia was too far away.

784
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,830
And we went up to Canada
and I just, like, "Oh, my God..."

785
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,082
I was trying to make it work,
trying to make it work.

786
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:38,336
Looking around, scouting, and
I realised this will be a waste of money.

787
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:41,756
It'll just be...

788
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,177
There's no way the crew can do
the serious kind of stunt work

789
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,014
that we really do on our sets,

790
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,017
'cause they just don't have
a lot of great stunt work up there,

791
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,021
and you gotta ship in too many people,
and it just would be a lost cause.

792
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:01,192
And so the studio gave me some grief
for not going up there.

793
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:07,031
So I ended up giving 30% of my fees
so I can shoot with my crew in America,

794
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:12,787
and that's because I'm loyal to my crew,
and they're just, I think, the best.

795
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:25,132
The sound work was done
by Ethan Van der Ryn and Mike Hopkins

796
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:31,430
who did the sound work for
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>King Kong.</i>

797
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:37,728
Mike is from New Zealand,
Ethan was trained up at Lucasfilm.

798
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,273
And I must say, awesome sound.

799
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:44,735
When you listen on this DVD,
it is just awesome sound.

800
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:48,823
My mixers, Kevin O'Connell
and Greg Russell...

801
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:52,660
Kevin, by the way, is the biggest
Academy loser in Academy history.

802
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:55,830
He's lost, I think, 20 times.

803
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,667
He's done some amazing movies.
He's an amazing mixer.

804
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,003
As a team, they're amazing mixers.

805
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:06,674
And Kevin and Greg said to me,
in all their time on mixing,

806
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:11,429
they felt this was the most inventive
sound work they've ever worked with.

807
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:14,432
And, meanwhile, they feel
it's one of their finest sound designs

808
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:18,269
and mixing efforts
that they've done as of yet.

809
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:22,189
We had to invent
so many different sounds here,

810
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:25,192
and it just gives these robots
such personality,

811
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:29,822
and it's really just a launching pad
for where we can go on number two.

812
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:02,229
I have no idea why this scene right here,

813
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:06,567
and I've seen this movie from
Korea to Australia, all over Europe,

814
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:14,492
America, just why
right here in the movie,

815
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:17,912
they applaud when this yellow car
comes up.

816
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,414
Oh, that shot. Let me tell you
about that shot right there.

817
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:22,958
That was the most patient
I've ever been

818
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,504
for doing a stunt
in the history of my career.

819
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:30,383
That took exactly three and half hours
for that guy to go up on two wheels.

820
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:31,676
Why was he on two wheels?

821
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,095
Well, he was on two wheels
because, I don't know,

822
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,680
I wanted the guy up on two wheels

823
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:39,809
and, you know, wanted to go old school
with the stunt there.

824
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:44,313
That Camaro was a prototype that I saw

825
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:46,482
when I was looking through
all these car companies,

826
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,776
new kind of prototypes
that were coming out.

827
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,570
Then I saw this
at the skunk works at GM,

828
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,781
this little, kind of secret
building in California

829
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,575
where they do kind of
these concept cars,

830
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,369
and I kind of knew right away
that was the car.

831
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:00,371
That was gonna be Bumblebee,

832
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:03,249
and the fans were gonna give me grief
because it wasn't a Volkswagen,

833
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:09,046
but there's just no way I could do
this movie if this was a VW bug.

834
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,262
And so I just felt that was the car.

835
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:39,118
So there's a scene
with this little girl in her bed.

836
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:44,749
And, you know, this girl was five,

837
00:59:44,832 --> 00:59:48,544
and I actually hired two of them
for the exact same scene,

838
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,714
and I shot one shot with one and
another one literally with the other girl,

839
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,217
and we were like flipping back and forth,
'cause I knew...

840
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,221
The studio teacher
that comes with the kid

841
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:03,058
is a kind of a social worker
that watches the kids.

842
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:05,519
She said, "I've never seen a director
in my 20 years

843
01:00:05,603 --> 01:00:07,897
"ever hire two girls for the same role."

844
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,982
I said, "Well, at 11:30 at night,

845
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,777
"when we have 20 minutes
left on our time,

846
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,488
"where you have to take the kids,
we're doing the most important shot

847
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,072
"with this robot getting out of the pool,

848
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:19,742
"and I guarantee you,
one of them will crap out."

849
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:24,288
And sure enough, by the time we got to
the pool, one of them had crapped out.

850
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,333
And so we used the little blond girl.

851
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:31,128
This was a fun night for the crew,
I must say,

852
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:34,381
because we're up there at this house,
it's 8:00 at night,

853
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:37,301
and I said to the guy,
"So what crane do we have?"

854
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:41,639
And everyone kind of looked at me.
It was like the silent look.

855
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,307
"Crane?"

856
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,394
"Well, guys, you saw the animatic,
what we need to do, right?

857
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,397
"We have to move this,
like, long move, and whatever."

858
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:53,567
Well, let me tell you, they called
every place around Hollywood.

859
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:56,570
I don't know how they manufactured
this weird-ass crane,

860
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,739
but anyway, we got to do this shot.

861
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:01,075
And this was our very first take
with the girl.

862
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:05,162
Now it's very hard, 'cause she has to
follow this pole above her six times

863
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,415
and right there when she does
that little stutter step, I just loved it,

864
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:11,544
'cause she tripped
and it just looked more real.

865
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,421
And ILM said,
"Whoa! Let's use the other shot

866
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:15,923
"'cause she looks like
she screwed up."

867
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:20,553
I said, "That's what it's about. It's about
a kid screwing up. That's what it is."

868
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:43,784
Now the concept car,
'cause we only had one in the world,

869
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,703
we had to actually build it.

870
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:48,205
And once we got the CAD files
and the okay...

871
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:50,291
It's very hard to get CAD files
from a car company

872
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:53,460
because of thievery
or whatever they call it.

873
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,987
This shot right here
with Optimus transforming,

874
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:23,490
this is one of the shots we made
very early on in the animatic process

875
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:26,076
that got me excited about the movie.

876
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,625
This is almost verbatim to our animatic
that we created in my office.

877
01:02:33,626 --> 01:02:36,670
I think this moment right here
when I finally heard all the sounds

878
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,633
with Peter Cullen's amazing voice.

879
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,509
Thank God the fans actually...

880
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,470
I kept listening to fans,
and they were right.

881
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,680
You guys were right all the way through.

882
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:51,101
But I just wanted to have an open mind
of who can play these robots, so...

883
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:52,895
You know you can't fault me for that.

884
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,440
But that was Optimus Prime.
When he speaks, let me tell you...

885
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,694
But when Ethan and Mike
added those sounds to Optimus,

886
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,822
it just made it come to life.

887
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:06,784
You know when you look at these
effects right here, it's just so real

888
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:10,913
in terms of the reflections of the metal
and how they fit in.

889
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:44,697
You know, there's the whole thing about
<i>Transformers</i> about mass-shifting,

890
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,367
and to me, that was just
always a complex thing.

891
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,830
It was very hard to get across
in movie-making,

892
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:57,584
and I wanted to keep
the idea of the robots.

893
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:01,422
If you're coming from a vehicle,
you've gotta kind of stay that same size

894
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:04,383
of whatever that vehicle
you could possibly stretch it out to.

895
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:05,884
So, yeah, I got some flak about

896
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:12,266
changing Optimus from
a flat-nose to a long-nose,

897
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:16,937
and the long-nose just made him
so he can be 28 feet

898
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:22,985
instead of the 20 feet that
he would've been with a flat-nose truck.

899
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:26,864
And, you know, I got a lot of flak for that.

900
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:33,912
And then I got more flak
for putting flames on Optimus.

901
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:37,916
Boy, I mean, it was literally...
Death threats all started over again,

902
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,130
and the "Damn you, Michael Bay!"
And whatever the hell it was.

903
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,174
I mean it's just,
you know, I wanted flames.

904
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,383
I mean, if you want a pink house,

905
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:47,718
I want a green house.
What's the difference?

906
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,345
I'm the director,
and, it's just, that's what I wanted.

907
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:54,725
And I knew the flames
were barely visible

908
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,769
when you saw him
when he was transformed,

909
01:04:56,852 --> 01:05:00,355
and it kind of gave the impression
that he had ribs.

910
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:05,402
And it was a picture of a truck
that I saw, and I wanted to copy it.

911
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:07,696
And I must say,

912
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,533
I went to my teamster captain,

913
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:16,580
and I said... They're in charge
of painting vehicles, and I said,

914
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:20,876
"I'm telling you, a white guy is not
allowed to paint those flames, okay?

915
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:24,129
"I want, what we call in LA,
I want a cholo.

916
01:05:24,213 --> 01:05:26,715
"I want a guy who is an artist

917
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,676
"who knows how to do these
amazing kind of cholo cars.

918
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,304
"It's art. Find him, all right?"

919
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:36,225
And so the funniest picture
I got in this entire movie was our guy.

920
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:39,978
He's from Mexico. He had a cup
of coffee with his hat backwards.

921
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:43,816
He's sitting in the art kitchen. They took
a picture of him and said,

922
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:45,109
"Here he is. This is your guy.

923
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:48,112
"He doesn't speak any English.
We're gonna use an interpreter.

924
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:49,655
"But he does amazing flames."

925
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:54,368
And I gotta tell you, they were
the most beautiful flames I've ever seen.

926
01:06:22,563 --> 01:06:25,315
I must say,
I did audition Peter Cullen twice.

927
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:30,696
They wanted me to go
with Frank Welker for Megatron.

928
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:36,994
To me, Frank Welker, great voice artist,
but it just sounded too cartoon to me,

929
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:42,082
and I don't think I could really tell
Frank to change it for this movie.

930
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:45,002
It just wouldn't feel right.

931
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:47,880
So early on in the process

932
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:51,133
when I picked certain actors

933
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:55,470
to be what I would interpret
that character to be...

934
01:06:55,554 --> 01:06:59,433
Like, let me give you an idea.
Liam Neeson was Optimus Prime,

935
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,644
Michael J. Fox was Bumblebee,

936
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,105
Hugo Weaving was Megatron.

937
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:07,316
And, you know, just in terms of movies

938
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:11,528
that I wanted the artist to look at,
to kind of emulate,

939
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,739
not the way they move,
but just how regal,

940
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:17,784
like, Liam Neeson is,
to, you know, Hugo Weaving.

941
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:22,122
And it's just his voice, Hugo's voice just
kept sticking in my head for Megatron.

942
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:27,794
One of my producers,
Lorenzo di Bonaventura,

943
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:31,715
who used to run Warner Brothers,
he did the <i>Matrix</i> movies.

944
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,843
And he called Hugo
and got him into doing this,

945
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:39,640
and Hugo was down in Australia and
I was directing him from here via iChat

946
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,516
and they had the movie down there,

947
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,311
and it was amazing how I was able
to direct him so far away

948
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,729
in modern technology.

949
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:49,441
But he just has an awesome voice
for Megatron.

950
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,235
So I never get sick when I shoot.

951
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,529
You just kind of have this adrenalin
that carries you

952
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:41,660
for a full year-and-a-half,
two years through a movie.

953
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:47,207
But one day I had a little vacation
down in Cabo,

954
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:51,753
'cause I guess
there was a union break we had,

955
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:58,260
and I leaned down in the elevator
of Air Force One, I'm like, "Uh-oh!

956
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,929
"Maybe we got a little Cabo-Wabo
something going on there."

957
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:06,351
And within an hour,
I just got violently sick with the flu,

958
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:09,229
and I'm sitting in my chair,
and I'm shaking and I'm sweating,

959
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:12,232
and I'm like, "I'm okay, I can direct.
I'm okay, I'm okay."

960
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:14,609
And you know how you get
when you get fluey.

961
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:18,405
So I went outside of the trailer,
and I had to lie down on the asphalt

962
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,574
'cause I was so cold. I'm shivering.

963
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,535
And my producer, Ian Bryce, is standing
there and says, "Buddy, you gotta go."

964
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:26,538
I said, "No, no, I've never gone home
ever, ever in my career,

965
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,541
"ever gone home sick.
No, I'm not going home."

966
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:33,837
And then we had some gigantic days
like, literally, two days away,

967
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,299
we had to shoot downtown
at the cost of, like, $375 each,

968
01:09:37,382 --> 01:09:42,471
and it's a big deal to shut
all that stuff downtown.

969
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:45,140
And then the set doctor came by
and she says,

970
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:48,602
"You got 102-and-a-half.
You gotta go home," so...

971
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:53,315
Anyway, I kicked it kind of, sort of,
like the next day, or whatever,

972
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,942
but I was sick and kind of whatever,

973
01:09:56,026 --> 01:10:00,947
and I had to direct in my trailer,
so they had a microphone.

974
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:04,409
And I was kind of like Coppola
in the Silverfish where he would direct,

975
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:06,161
but he had a Jacuzzi in his.

976
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:07,579
But I was trying to direct my crew

977
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:10,415
and they were so slow
without me on the set.

978
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:15,921
We went from 50-something set-ups
a day to 15, and I'm on a microphone,

979
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:19,966
and it was just like, "Guys,
you are so slow. What's going on?"

980
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,593
It was pretty funny.

981
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,106
So, you know, working on these scenes,

982
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:20,777
they are looking at literally window
washer poles with different heights.

983
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:24,489
And those arms we had two window
washer poles with tennis balls on them

984
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:27,951
so that they can actually kind of
have an eye line to watch.

985
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,290
It makes it kind of hard

986
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,042
when you're trying to do camera moves
without things there

987
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,795
and trying to imagine what fits in.

988
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:42,257
That's why the animatics
were huge helps for the actor to see.

989
01:11:43,133 --> 01:11:46,678
There are times like this,
this is a shot I made up on the fly,

990
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,014
just having Optimus look in.

991
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,742
I always do these crazy things, like,
this should've been a set,

992
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:12,829
but I like shooting in a real house
where I have the access to the outside.

993
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:18,084
The houses are always way too small,
locations are small.

994
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,879
Sometimes locations
just feel better to me.

995
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:24,591
And even though this is
a minuscule room we're shooting in

996
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,927
with a crew. It's sometimes ridiculous.

997
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:29,179
Right there, she grabbed that box.

998
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,931
That was kind of an improv thing.
And he ran over.

999
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:34,392
I mean, that's got to be his porn box,
I would think, you know.

1000
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:36,061
Every boy's got that
somewhere in the room,

1001
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:38,939
and guess we all understand that,
don't we?

1002
01:13:21,773 --> 01:13:24,859
The way we'd get facial emotions like
this from Optimus, I'd actually...

1003
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:27,571
The animators up north
or down here at DD

1004
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:30,740
would kind of imitate something,
video themselves or whatnot,

1005
01:13:30,824 --> 01:13:33,577
and then they'd kind of animate
how that would work.

1006
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:36,288
Or we'd actually use actors
to do certain things.

1007
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:39,457
We wouldn't use motion capture
like you would here...

1008
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:01,164
First time
I showed this scene to Steven,

1009
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,249
I said, "Steven, I want you to...

1010
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,002
"I'm almost done with my rough cut.
I want you to see some scenes."

1011
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:08,546
He goes, "No, no, no. I want to see
the movie when it's all done."

1012
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,590
I go, "Come on, Steven,
I want you to see this scene."

1013
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:13,218
So he was watching
this scene particularly,

1014
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:15,345
around the house,
with the robots around the house.

1015
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:16,471
And it was hysterical

1016
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,391
because he kept hitting me on the leg
and laughing like a kid.

1017
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,267
And I'm like, "What are you doing?"

1018
01:15:21,351 --> 01:15:26,815
And he goes,
"I have never seen robots do this."

1019
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:29,192
It was a funny moment

1020
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,445
because, considering I filed his
<i>Raiders of the LostArk</i> storyboards...

1021
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,782
And now this guy is slapping me on
the leg saying he's never seen robots.

1022
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,660
And I'm like, "You're the dude
that's invented dinosaurs,

1023
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,453
"and you've seen everything."

1024
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:44,374
And he goes, "But I've never seen this."
So that was kind of a fun moment.

1025
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:45,583
Also a funny moment,

1026
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:49,879
when we saw the first cut at my house
in my screening room,

1027
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:53,425
he kept giving me high fives
when he was watching the movie.

1028
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:57,262
Spielberg giving me high fives
when he's watching the movie.

1029
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,638
When a good scene would come on,

1030
01:15:58,722 --> 01:16:01,558
you'd see his arm go up, "Bam!"
Another high five.

1031
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,770
But, you know,
when I do scenes, I actually...

1032
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:08,648
When I'm doing the illustration
and the animatic process...

1033
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:09,941
Like, a shot like this.

1034
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:13,278
This was like a seminal shot
you base these scenes around.

1035
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,989
And so this shot was created
very early on

1036
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:22,412
in the animatic process.

1037
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,622
Those are the scenes
I kind of hang my hat on.

1038
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:27,709
Or those are what
the charm of the movie is.

1039
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,799
John Turturro in his character study,

1040
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,842
he kept saying
he was trying to imitate me.

1041
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:20,553
Now, I don't understand
how his character

1042
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:24,516
is even the slightest bit imitating me
because that's not who I am.

1043
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:28,353
But according to him, that's what I am.
See, I would never do that.

1044
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:38,446
John's character, we kind of felt
that he was a Sector Seven Agent,

1045
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:43,451
that his great-great-grandfather
was a Sector Seven Agent.

1046
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:46,079
He's been doing it for generations.

1047
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,539
It was actually in the movie,

1048
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:49,958
in some of the dialogue,
and we actually cut it out,

1049
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,793
made it pretty funny for his character.

1050
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:55,213
He thinks he still lives with his mom
and whatnot.

1051
01:17:56,881 --> 01:18:00,134
He was questioning his sexuality
in this movie.

1052
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:03,137
I just didn't think
that was really necessary.

1053
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:04,848
John, I don't think
we have to really go there.

1054
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:06,099
I think you're a guy, okay?

1055
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,143
So just let's keep it at that, all right?

1056
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:12,772
He was a great delight to work with.

1057
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:16,860
He has the best Scorsese imitation
you have ever seen.

1058
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,069
I think we must have that.

1059
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,614
We must have that
somewhere in the making of.

1060
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:11,581
I don't know
where we found this little dog stick,

1061
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,166
but I just thought
that was a funny moment.

1062
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,585
"Put that thing around the dog, please."

1063
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:17,670
Mom walks out and she says,
"I'll kick your ass."

1064
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,589
Judy's a funny woman.

1065
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:13,703
We actually hung these actors
on this little contraption

1066
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,455
that would spin them around.

1067
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:19,542
I got on the car with the operators,
and it's quite fun.

1068
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:25,256
I got to tell you, this stunt, where we
strapped cameras, right there, bam,

1069
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,467
that looked like it hurt.

1070
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:53,326
The scene where we pull the guns out,

1071
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:57,038
look at the driver in the car
with John Turturro.

1072
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:00,291
We had little Jazz here.
He uses his magnetic gun right there.

1073
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:04,504
If you freeze it, watch as the gun...
Watch the guns fly up past the guys.

1074
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:07,423
I want you to go back in that DVD
and freeze it.

1075
01:22:07,507 --> 01:22:10,134
Because I told the driver,
I said, "No, you will not get hurt.

1076
01:22:10,218 --> 01:22:14,597
"They're rubber guns and they're on
bungee cords and they're gonna pull."

1077
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,434
If you freeze it, you'll see it hit him
kind of on the temple.

1078
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:22,939
He goes, "I thought you said
it wasn't gonna hurt." Well, I'm sorry.

1079
01:22:34,075 --> 01:22:36,119
I don't know, I was kind of crazy
when I told the writers,

1080
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:40,039
I said, "I really want to have
Bumblebee piss on John Turturro."

1081
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:45,419
Call me crazy, but you know what?
At least the audiences laughed.

1082
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:57,014
You know, doing <i>Transformers,</i>
I got to tell you,

1083
01:22:57,098 --> 01:23:00,476
a bunch of adults running around
the set the first couple of days

1084
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,855
and saying the word
"Bumblebee" and "Megatron"...

1085
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:06,649
I remember the first couple of days,

1086
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:11,487
literally about 50 airmen, military extras

1087
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:14,657
at Holloman Air Force Base

1088
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,618
and I said, "I know, guys,
this sounds really stupid,

1089
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:22,582
"but you're gonna have this big robot
fly in, transform, land right here."

1090
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:28,087
And the guys were in their 20s, 30s,
they go, "Would that be Starscream?"

1091
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:31,549
I'm like... You know, it was...

1092
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:33,801
I honestly did not think

1093
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:36,554
there were that many fans
around the world for this thing.

1094
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:41,851
And how much it meant
to people that are now in their 30s...

1095
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:48,191
Being told but seeing in your life
is a different thing.

1096
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:55,323
But for Hasbro to say, "This is the
largest-selling toy around the world.

1097
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:59,327
"It's the top-five largest selling toy
around the world for 20 years."

1098
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,536
I think that's a big accomplishment.

1099
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,288
But I just didn't realise the depth

1100
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,791
of how many fans there were
around the world.

1101
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:12,673
And, you know, right now,
you just kind of...

1102
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:15,092
As we were getting ready
to release the movie,

1103
01:24:15,176 --> 01:24:19,096
the trailers were always, like, in Yahoo,

1104
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:23,601
like, the number-one downloaded,
most watched, consistently

1105
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:26,646
from when they came out Christmas
till almost the day of the release.

1106
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,190
Like, <i>Pirates</i> would come up there,
and they would fall back down,

1107
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:31,525
but we were always one and two
for the entire time.

1108
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:33,444
And that kind of told me something.

1109
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:38,741
It actually became one of the most
downloaded trailers in history,

1110
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,369
according to Yahoo
that tracks this stuff.

1111
01:24:43,579 --> 01:24:45,581
So all those kind of signs
were telling me something.

1112
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:50,670
And when it opened and it became the
largest non-sequel opening of all time,

1113
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,422
I guess I was...

1114
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:58,803
I just honestly did not think
it could do as well as it's done so far.

1115
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:02,431
I mean,
it's gonna pass 300-plus million here.

1116
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:08,145
And it's right up there
with the <i>Spider-Man</i> and <i>Pirates 3,</i>

1117
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,356
these gigantic franchises.

1118
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,360
And internationally, it's gonna...

1119
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,821
Right now
we're already at 260-something,

1120
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:20,241
and it'll probably go to 350, 400,
I don't know.

1121
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:26,414
Anyway, I guess it was a good gamble
for the studio on this.

1122
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:39,260
A lot of people would've done that
helicopter shot right there digitally,

1123
01:25:39,385 --> 01:25:41,554
but not me, for some reason.

1124
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:45,349
That was a real helicopter
very close to that bus.

1125
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:49,061
I just like things real.
As much real as I can get, I'm gonna do.

1126
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:53,232
It seems to be like a dying art
with a lot of directors now

1127
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:57,361
where you do your own stunts,
you do a lot of stunts and stuff like that.

1128
01:25:57,445 --> 01:26:00,239
Doing these gigantic moves
on this special Akela crane,

1129
01:26:00,323 --> 01:26:04,076
which is like 75 feet tall,
we're able to do these big drops.

1130
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:07,872
This was kind of a chaotic scene

1131
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:10,916
because we had four helicopters,
one airship,

1132
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:19,258
and it was quite noisy in this river of...

1133
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:21,510
I don't know if that's...

1134
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:26,474
I don't know what's in that river.
That polluted river right there.

1135
01:26:27,475 --> 01:26:30,186
We actually saved a guy's life
in the river that night.

1136
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,604
We just so happened to be there

1137
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,940
when a guy in a hospital uniform
was floating by.

1138
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:36,817
And literally,
there's no getting out of that thing

1139
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,986
because that channel
travels very quickly.

1140
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:42,865
And it's all algae, there's no stopping,
it goes all the way to the ocean.

1141
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:48,287
One of our electricians just threw out
a piece of cable and saved this guy,

1142
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:51,374
who was like an escapee
from some hospital.

1143
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,008
I've never worked on a movie

1144
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,427
where obviously
I've had to do so much digital animation,

1145
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:05,638
character animation.

1146
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,974
It was really one of the most
fascinating things about this movie,

1147
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:12,061
is actually directing
these kind of creatures

1148
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,814
and ultimately making them feel

1149
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:18,567
like you've got a soul inside of them
when you see these things.

1150
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:22,154
And I think it's done
through sound and facial stuff.

1151
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:25,074
You just start to feel for this thing
that doesn't even exist.

1152
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:28,828
I think that's kind of
the accomplishment of the movie.

1153
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:55,312
Right there, right there,
that's the mock-up of Bumblebee

1154
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,565
we actually built for 200 grand.

1155
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:01,652
Really complicated to build.
You couldn't really shoot it that closely.

1156
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:02,903
Like you're gonna see right there,

1157
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:06,198
it's the mock-up
which saves money on digital shots.

1158
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,701
And then there again
you see the mock-up,

1159
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:11,579
and then we go back to a digital shot.

1160
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:14,707
So if you use it sparingly, right there,

1161
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:19,545
the five, six, seven shots with
that mock-up just saved a lot of money.

1162
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,173
We only had mock-up pieces
of like, Optimus Prime,

1163
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:27,052
and certain head sections
but nothing that detailed.

1164
01:28:27,178 --> 01:28:32,224
We built Megatron's legs
in the chamber where he's being held.

1165
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:36,896
We built about 30 feet of his legs,
which cost us half a million dollars,

1166
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:41,192
but when we use it through those shots
it actually saves you on effect shots.

1167
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:42,776
Because every one of those pieces...

1168
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,946
Reason why it's so expensive,
you've got to carve it out of foam,

1169
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:50,534
and then it's got to be on a steel
kind of frame to hold it up.

1170
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,664
This shot right here,
I call it "the jungle gym Optimus."

1171
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:56,999
I just hated the blocking of it,

1172
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:00,878
but we were just kind of stuck
with the shot that we had shot.

1173
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:02,087
Often times the animators

1174
01:29:02,213 --> 01:29:03,839
had to squeeze in
where we could fit our robots.

1175
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:08,719
We got to be very good
at shooting robots after a while.

1176
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:10,888
We used a special tool.

1177
01:29:12,306 --> 01:29:16,602
It's a Porsche Cayenne with a special
crane on it where we were able

1178
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:21,023
to move at a high rate of speed on a car

1179
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,483
and we can do these
amazing crane moves.

1180
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:27,821
It was actually a robot-cam
where we could spin around.

1181
01:29:27,947 --> 01:29:29,949
Right there walking through
National Military Command,

1182
01:29:30,074 --> 01:29:31,283
that was a room that I'd been to,

1183
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:34,453
it's in the basement of the Pentagon,
that's where they run wars and whatnot.

1184
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:38,374
And the thing that I always remember
was going down there,

1185
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,334
they have these two Lucite doors

1186
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:45,756
that are like bullet-proof and blast-proof
and you have to go through these doors.

1187
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:53,931
The chamber that we take this
conversation that comes up

1188
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:57,810
is called the Vault
in the Pentagon, actually.

1189
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:00,813
It's this soundproof room
that has this vault door

1190
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:03,357
and it has five seats

1191
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:10,155
for the Secretary of Defence and
the four different branches of military,

1192
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:12,491
with a direct link to the President.

1193
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:14,994
They feel that this room is like,

1194
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,413
the fewer people
that know about what's going on,

1195
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:19,748
the better a secret could be kept.

1196
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:23,419
We kind of designed it
exactly the way I saw the room

1197
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:27,715
from my memory, I guess,
when I was down at the Pentagon.

1198
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:28,966
They actually took me into the room

1199
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,260
where the two guys are there
to launch nuclear weapons.

1200
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:35,639
They sit in their own vault.
It was kind of an odd experience.

1201
01:30:35,723 --> 01:30:36,807
I was down at the Pentagon

1202
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:40,728
when I was doing <i>Pearl Harbor,</i>
the tap dance.

1203
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:47,192
I met with every branch of the military
because of the cooperation we needed.

1204
01:30:49,028 --> 01:30:53,449
Actually, <i>Transformers,</i> since
<i>Black Hawk Down</i> and <i>Pearl Harbor...</i>

1205
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,784
This has been
the largest military cooperation

1206
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:58,829
that they've done thus far
since those two movies.

1207
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:10,382
This is actually the very first stuff

1208
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:14,261
we ever shot for <i>Transformers</i>
right here, the Mars rover here.

1209
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:15,971
It was part of our teaser.

1210
01:31:16,055 --> 01:31:17,264
I've always been fascinated,

1211
01:31:17,389 --> 01:31:21,852
what if the Mars rover found something
that was of human origin?

1212
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,563
So it's something
I always saved for a movie.

1213
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:24,832
Josh Duhamel is someone I met

1214
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:27,960
in one of my Platinum Dunes meetings,
for a movie,

1215
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:31,880
and I just liked his energy.
He just was a great guy.

1216
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:34,675
And he's got those movie star looks.

1217
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,930
Just thought he would be
a good fit in this movie.

1218
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:44,184
Jon Voight's one of the elder statesmen.
He's just...

1219
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,979
Actors love hanging around him.
He's a really fun guy.

1220
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:49,815
He's just such a good actor.

1221
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:56,321
And it was nice to see
all these young actors around him.

1222
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:01,034
He's really such a leader
among these actors.

1223
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,831
Steven wanted me to cast this movie
where I wasn't using movie stars,

1224
01:33:05,956 --> 01:33:08,625
like he would do a lot of his movies.

1225
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:10,919
Because, you know,
the movie was the star.

1226
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:14,256
The Transformers were the star.

1227
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:17,050
I think right now
you've got this Shia LaBeouf,

1228
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:19,470
who's just gonna explode off the screen.

1229
01:33:19,553 --> 01:33:23,223
He's now in <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

1230
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:28,896
The guy is, you know,
he's like the young Tom Hanks.

1231
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:36,570
He's just one of those kids
that really has exploded off the screen.

1232
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,198
I'm proud to have worked with him.

1233
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:44,578
He's been a lot of fun
to work with, actually. Great energy.

1234
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:26,537
This is the Los Angeles Observatory,

1235
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:30,874
and it's been under renovation
for five years.

1236
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:37,130
And California becomes
a very tough place to shoot,

1237
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:40,801
where they just make it tough to shoot.

1238
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:42,010
And that's been closed...

1239
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:45,264
And when you have a big movie,
you have a lot more clout.

1240
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,143
So going to City Hall
and convincing them

1241
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:51,854
that we're bringing this
gigantic movie here,

1242
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:55,774
and we're keeping it here in America
and in California

1243
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,819
where things are running away,
moving out of state.

1244
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:04,074
And we demanded certain things,
like to shoot at this observatory.

1245
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:08,078
I think the only way I got into
this observatory, from what I heard,

1246
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:09,913
because it's run by this doctor,

1247
01:35:09,997 --> 01:35:14,167
he knows someone
who is married into my family

1248
01:35:14,293 --> 01:35:16,545
called Leonard Nimoy.
You know, Spock,

1249
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,255
who's a big giver of the...

1250
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:22,092
Susan Bay and Leonard Nimoy
are big givers to the Observatory.

1251
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:25,429
Right here this is the Hoover Dam.

1252
01:35:25,512 --> 01:35:28,056
And that's its actual wall.

1253
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:31,852
They don't touch it because
it's kind of a landmark, obviously,

1254
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:34,563
and they don't put rails around it
and whatnot.

1255
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:37,441
They told me I wasn't allowed
to do anything that exploded by it,

1256
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:40,152
because they're worried about
a terrorist blowing up the dam.

1257
01:35:40,235 --> 01:35:41,653
Now, let me tell you something.

1258
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:44,615
I think you need a nuclear bomb
to blow that thing up

1259
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:48,744
because it's seven football fields
thick of concrete.

1260
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:50,037
It was made in three years.

1261
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:54,166
It was a constant pour. Actually it was
made in four... I think, four years.

1262
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,211
A constant pour,

1263
01:35:58,337 --> 01:36:01,715
where they poured one piece
of concrete for four years.

1264
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,883
When I did this movie,

1265
01:36:03,008 --> 01:36:04,801
I mean, certain people in California
look at this movie,

1266
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:06,720
like, "Is this director stupid?

1267
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:09,848
"Because they go from Nevada
all the way to Los Angeles.

1268
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:12,059
"How did they go so fast?"

1269
01:36:12,184 --> 01:36:15,479
Ultimately, most people
don't know where this dam is,

1270
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:17,522
which is in Nevada.

1271
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:23,236
Half of it's in Nevada, half is in Arizona,
by the way.

1272
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:26,281
And I tried to shoot Los Angeles
not as Los Angeles

1273
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:28,367
but Anytown, USA.

1274
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:35,540
That shot you just saw there,
that crane shot by the dam,

1275
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:39,461
we had to keep our crane very low
because of possible arcing,

1276
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:43,590
where it would arc from
the gigantic power lines onto the crane,

1277
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:46,927
just because of metals
too close to these power lines

1278
01:36:47,052 --> 01:36:49,930
that could jump
and kill my crew members.

1279
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:53,266
It's very scary, I must say.

1280
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,687
This was shot down
at the Spruce Goose,

1281
01:36:56,770 --> 01:37:00,607
where we built this entire set.
We did some digital extensions here.

1282
01:37:01,483 --> 01:37:05,487
We used some of the actual
Spruce Goose walls.

1283
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,614
It just gave me
a lot more production value.

1284
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,283
Right there, you're seeing that's all real,

1285
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:13,120
everything there is built,
those feet are real.

1286
01:37:14,413 --> 01:37:17,374
It even says "Bay Foundry"
right there on that little plaque

1287
01:37:17,457 --> 01:37:19,292
right there if you zoom in.

1288
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:24,631
My grandfather actually helped
build that platform... No, I'm kidding.

1289
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:29,678
My grandfather
was in the stonewashing business.

1290
01:37:30,429 --> 01:37:31,972
Like you need to know that.

1291
01:37:32,097 --> 01:37:34,516
He actually never thought
I would make it in the film industry.

1292
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:36,518
He always thought
I would be stonewashing jeans.

1293
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:38,603
Thank God I wasn't doing that.

1294
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:59,291
Right here,
that was a real structure as well.

1295
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:01,543
We built part of the hands.

1296
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:15,974
We walk into this next scene.

1297
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:18,060
I had a very funny speech
for John Turturro.

1298
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:22,272
He actually... John kind of sparked off
something I said,

1299
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:23,774
and he made up this very funny speech

1300
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:28,153
which is in kind of the added extras,
extra scenes.

1301
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:41,875
Right here, that was an all-digital shot.

1302
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:46,171
For some reason, I just
wanted pictures of the First Seven.

1303
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,339
I don't know what it means.

1304
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:50,634
I think these are the guys that helped
discover this Cube long before,

1305
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:53,095
and then they built the dam
over this Cube.

1306
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:19,246
So when we had to shoot
by the F-22 on the ground,

1307
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:22,707
it was a totally secured area.

1308
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,584
And they
wouldn't allow Simon Warnock,

1309
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:27,629
who was my assistant director, near
the plane because he was a foreigner.

1310
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,465
And I didn't want him near the plane
because he's clumsy.

1311
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:36,388
It's $130 million plane made out of
composite material and whatnot.

1312
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,098
They wouldn't allow your cell phones
near the plane.

1313
01:39:38,223 --> 01:39:42,227
I think they were worried about
radio interference or something,

1314
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,770
I'm not sure.

1315
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:45,647
That Blackout pilot was

1316
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:49,025
actually the helicopter pilot
of that very helicopter,

1317
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:51,486
and when we hired Moustache Man,

1318
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:54,739
the guy actually flying,

1319
01:39:54,865 --> 01:39:57,659
I said, "My God, you look just like
the Moustache Man I'd imagined."

1320
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:59,077
And Steven Spielberg called me up

1321
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:01,580
and goes, "That's exactly
how I pictured Moustache Man."

1322
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:06,084
So, we actually had him
delay his wedding and his honeymoon

1323
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:08,837
so that we can come
and shoot <i>Transformers</i>

1324
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,424
and thus make more money
for his future babies.

1325
01:40:12,549 --> 01:40:14,551
So we helped in the cause.

1326
01:40:23,894 --> 01:40:27,397
Originally when we did this scene,
I really wanted to have a little iPod,

1327
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,525
but Steve Jobs wouldn't allow it.

1328
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:34,571
So we ended up using some, I guess,
Nokia phone or whatnot.

1329
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:37,115
On that sign behind John Turturro

1330
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:41,369
it says, "The last accident
happened here 322 days ago,"

1331
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:47,167
because that meant that 323 days ago
someone was killed in that very facility,

1332
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:49,669
as you saw the scratches in the wall
and whatnot.

1333
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:53,131
I actually ended up cutting it out
just for time.

1334
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:03,266
I think when we do <i>Transformers 2,</i>

1335
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:06,686
I think this is a start of something
where we can branch off

1336
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:09,481
what can really go on,
happen in our world.

1337
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:15,362
That is, if I'm gonna do <i>Transformers 2,</i>
still haven't made the deal yet.

1338
01:41:16,821 --> 01:41:18,365
Listen, I gambled my fee on this movie.

1339
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,825
That means
I put my <i>cojones</i> on the line

1340
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:25,038
where I gambled my entire fee
that this movie would make money.

1341
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:30,126
So that's why when I go to Vegas
with my friends I don't gamble.

1342
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:31,836
'Cause I gamble
on $150 million movies.

1343
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,047
I don't need to be gambling
on $20 slot machines

1344
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:37,050
or, you know, $5 hands of blackjack.

1345
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:40,220
I gamble on big-ass movies,
that's what I do.

1346
01:42:02,742 --> 01:42:04,536
That was Kenny Bates and Ian Bryce.

1347
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:08,707
Kenny Bates is my stunt coordinator,
who I've worked with since <i>Bad Boys.</i>

1348
01:42:10,542 --> 01:42:12,711
He's like my older brother.

1349
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:19,926
He's like the Rain Man of stunts.

1350
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,846
Sometimes you can't understand
what he's saying,

1351
01:42:22,929 --> 01:42:24,764
but he's brilliant in his physics
and whatnot.

1352
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:29,561
He's gonna kill me for saying that,
but that's the truth.

1353
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:35,108
There's so much physics
when you do stunts

1354
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:39,237
in what can go wrong
and trying to predict what can go wrong.

1355
01:42:39,321 --> 01:42:43,366
That's why we've had such an amazing
safety record together.

1356
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,327
Because we do very dangerous stuff,

1357
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:49,581
but we've just been
incredibly safe about it.

1358
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:50,577
Steve Jablonsky did our music.
He is Hans Zimmer's protégé.

1359
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,412
Hans helped a little on the movie,
as well.

1360
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,039
It was very hard to get that theme,

1361
01:44:55,123 --> 01:44:57,459
that heroic theme
I wanted for <i>Transformers.</i>

1362
01:44:57,542 --> 01:45:00,587
And just one day, I said,
"Steve, that's the theme."

1363
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:03,381
I played it for Steven and Steven goes,
"I love that, it's very memorable."

1364
01:45:03,465 --> 01:45:09,721
Because it sounds like a Western.
It's just got that great tragic hero.

1365
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:15,268
Which I liked. It's just so powerful how
to get the right mood

1366
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:17,604
through music.

1367
01:45:19,606 --> 01:45:24,152
That's why I really feel that sound
in movies is 50% of a movie.

1368
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:27,614
What you try to do with music
is you try to set up different themes.

1369
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:29,324
You've got the heroic theme
for the Optimus.

1370
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:34,621
You've got Sam's theme
which is kind of by the lake.

1371
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:42,504
You've got the Decepticon theme
which is kind of, we found this...

1372
01:45:42,587 --> 01:45:45,798
There's this church choir in London

1373
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:51,763
that's got this very dark-sounding
church they record in,

1374
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:57,227
and we gave them
operatic kind of words that they sang.

1375
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:01,147
And it was just this chilling
kind of Decepticon music.

1376
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:08,238
You saw that Camaro
transform right there.

1377
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:12,492
That was officially the lamest shot
of the entire movie.

1378
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:17,205
That's why we cut it down.
You always have turkey shots.

1379
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:18,581
And that was, let me tell you, a turkey.

1380
01:46:18,665 --> 01:46:21,167
I'm gonna tell you another shot
when we get there.

1381
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:24,587
Steven actually wanted to pay for it.

1382
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:28,258
It's where Optimus' nose unfolds
and you see his face

1383
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:32,428
after he slides around the Camaro.
I never ended up putting it in the movie.

1384
01:46:32,512 --> 01:46:34,097
I left it off.

1385
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:57,287
Right here, that thing flying,
I didn't like that thing flying.

1386
01:46:57,370 --> 01:47:00,540
That flew a little farther
than I wanted for comfort.

1387
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:04,836
We had stuntmen down below,
but no one was hurt.

1388
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:22,228
That one sound when you see
Starscream on the top of that dam,

1389
01:47:22,312 --> 01:47:25,106
and he's vibrating, that's my favourite
sound in the entire movie.

1390
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:28,985
When you hear his body shudder,
right there.

1391
01:47:29,068 --> 01:47:34,782
What I'm gonna do in <i>Transformers 2</i>
is I'm gonna focus more on the faces.

1392
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:38,494
I guess, because of the limited number
of effects shots, I limited myself

1393
01:47:38,578 --> 01:47:40,913
on how close I went into these faces

1394
01:47:40,997 --> 01:47:43,708
so that I can, I guess,
do more with less.

1395
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:03,269
This is called our Alien Archive room,
that I thought was fun.

1396
01:48:03,353 --> 01:48:08,858
It's got books going 40 feet tall
up into the stacks.

1397
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:13,613
This holds all the Sector Seven stuff
that's been there through history

1398
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,617
of anything alien,
having to do with our world here.

1399
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:38,554
That shot where we're tracking
behind Optimus,

1400
01:48:38,638 --> 01:48:41,474
I'm actually in the Porsche Cayenne.
We're going 55 miles an hour,

1401
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:45,186
as an entire semi locks up,
and we are right behind.

1402
01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:48,314
I mean, I gotta tell you, that's
a little scary.

1403
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:53,069
We shot that scene where they're
driving in the Valley of Fire.

1404
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:56,364
We actually blew a roadblock
because the sun was going down.

1405
01:48:56,447 --> 01:49:00,326
Which means we passed
a cop roadblock, and we kept shooting

1406
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:03,996
on this road, and they were so pissed.

1407
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:08,543
They hauled Ian Bryce, my producer,
and he had to kiss a bunch of hands

1408
01:49:08,626 --> 01:49:13,548
in Vegas or they were gonna
shut us down at the Hoover Dam.

1409
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:16,134
So thank God to Ian, but I had
to get this shot. And you know what?

1410
01:49:16,217 --> 01:49:19,137
I'll run any police roadblock I have to
if the sun's going down,

1411
01:49:19,262 --> 01:49:20,722
and I got a beautiful shot.

1412
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:24,475
See, I'm never really good
at taking no for an answer.

1413
01:49:26,394 --> 01:49:30,314
I don't know,
"Whoops, I didn't see it, sorry."

1414
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:54,422
Doing this highway scene,
we shot it on a freeway, near Riverside.

1415
01:49:56,174 --> 01:50:00,178
I've done a lot of car stuff in my day.
We did this in two days.

1416
01:50:00,303 --> 01:50:04,515
We're actually launching cars off
a car carrier that are dropping

1417
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:08,770
onto the ground and the Bay Buster
is actually ramming into these cars.

1418
01:50:08,853 --> 01:50:11,272
It's a special thing that I built
on <i>Bad Boys 2.</i> Go see that disc,

1419
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:12,523
and then you'll learn all about it.

1420
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:15,026
So on this freeway, you can see
all those people standing up there?

1421
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,944
They heard that
<i>Transformers</i> was shooting

1422
01:50:17,028 --> 01:50:22,200
in the neighbourhood. So those are
real fans actually watching us shoot.

1423
01:50:22,283 --> 01:50:25,953
Right here, this is done with
a special go-cart and then we transition

1424
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:31,459
to the Porsche Cayenne camera
and we tilt down and we pull away.

1425
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:36,964
Two different moves
and we seamlessly blend it in together.

1426
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:39,967
So I wanted Bonecrusher, right here,
as he slaps through,

1427
01:50:40,051 --> 01:50:44,472
I wanted him to look like
a hockey player. So I had the...

1428
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:45,973
Right here,
this looks like a hockey player

1429
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:48,142
and then we go to a football tackle,
right there.

1430
01:50:48,226 --> 01:50:51,229
That was my favourite shot
in the whole movie, right there.

1431
01:50:51,312 --> 01:50:55,399
This was over a freeway
and we had the bigger moving crane.

1432
01:50:55,525 --> 01:51:00,071
We blocked this doing plates
and whatnot.

1433
01:51:00,196 --> 01:51:06,160
What I realised in the animation is the
animators are not fight choreographers.

1434
01:51:06,244 --> 01:51:09,413
Fight choreographers have been
working 20 years and been doing this.

1435
01:51:09,497 --> 01:51:13,251
So they spent forever on this stuff
right here, you're seeing right now,

1436
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:15,336
and they were never getting it right.

1437
01:51:15,419 --> 01:51:19,257
So what we did is, once I got
these plates, these shots,

1438
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:23,010
I actually used real fighters
that had different abilities,

1439
01:51:23,094 --> 01:51:24,595
different fighting skills,

1440
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:28,182
and I would videotape them
by a pole or whatnot,

1441
01:51:28,266 --> 01:51:31,269
and kind of imitate these angles.
And we actually had humans

1442
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:36,440
fighting this out at the same beat,
at the same time as these plates.

1443
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:40,611
And it wasn't motion-capture,
but they were able to copy

1444
01:51:40,695 --> 01:51:43,781
what these fighters were doing
in the time they were doing it.

1445
01:51:43,865 --> 01:51:47,702
So that became a very effective way
for us to work.

1446
01:51:51,247 --> 01:51:54,041
The voice of this little Frenzy guy,

1447
01:51:54,125 --> 01:51:56,586
he's just got the most amazing
human voice,

1448
01:51:56,669 --> 01:52:00,172
and we were able to overlay
some mechanical sounds over it.

1449
01:52:00,298 --> 01:52:02,341
It's amazing that humans
can actually talk like this.

1450
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:03,718
But it makes it quite funny.

1451
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:07,430
If you listen really closely,
he's saying the word "Tutankhamen."

1452
01:52:07,513 --> 01:52:09,015
He keeps saying "Tutankhamen,"

1453
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:12,977
I don't know, it's just a funny thing,
if you listen to it.

1454
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,622
Here we are at Edwards Air Force Base,

1455
01:52:32,788 --> 01:52:35,082
where they're actually going
into real F-22s,

1456
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:38,336
unlike <i>Die Hard,</i>
where they had to use fake F-22s,

1457
01:52:38,461 --> 01:52:40,504
because, I don't know,
they just don't have the juice.

1458
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:42,924
But we got real stuff.

1459
01:52:43,007 --> 01:52:46,636
That's because I got the phone number
to the Pentagon.

1460
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:04,195
Doing this downtown stuff,
I gotta tell you,

1461
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,197
is one of the harder things
that I've done

1462
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:10,451
in terms of keeping all these different
storylines going simultaneously.

1463
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:13,788
And unfortunately, what made it harder
for me is I was not able to shoot

1464
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:18,626
on one block consecutively.
I literally had to be shoved around LA

1465
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:23,631
to different blocks, and so I had to use
basically three different blocks.

1466
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:29,804
One in Detroit, two in LA... Actually four.
One on the Universal back lot.

1467
01:53:29,887 --> 01:53:34,892
And blend them all together
as if they're one.

1468
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:38,479
So some of the geography shots,
I don't really have,

1469
01:53:38,562 --> 01:53:43,150
because I was never able to do it.
Because they were different blocks,

1470
01:53:43,234 --> 01:53:46,946
and it would give things away.
So it made it very tough on me

1471
01:53:47,029 --> 01:53:51,575
to figure out some of the stuff.
But one of the helps was

1472
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:55,287
we had to shoot on the weekends,
so I was able to assemble

1473
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:59,166
what we were shooting,
so I can keep track of everything.

1474
01:53:59,709 --> 01:54:02,003
You know, it's just...

1475
01:54:02,086 --> 01:54:07,133
It's really hard when you've got
multiple stories going on.

1476
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:14,348
Especially this is like a 25-minute
ending action scene.

1477
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:19,562
This is one of my favourite
moments, here.

1478
01:54:19,645 --> 01:54:22,356
This was shot
on the Universal back lot, this shot.

1479
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,985
With a real truck, we moved it on cue.

1480
01:54:26,068 --> 01:54:29,321
Right there, we kind of shake it
because I'm counting it out.

1481
01:54:29,405 --> 01:54:34,285
We kind of walk it out for Shia,
how fast Bumblebee will be moving.

1482
01:54:35,828 --> 01:54:38,831
It's just beautiful animation right here,
and how he's straining, right there.

1483
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:42,209
See that arm going down
and the head shaking, right here.

1484
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:47,381
You can really get into the fine detail
with these animators.

1485
01:54:47,465 --> 01:54:51,302
That was Universal back lot,
right here and then the shot with Josh

1486
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:54,430
in the close up, that was downtown.
So it's just...

1487
01:54:56,223 --> 01:55:00,603
You gotta remember exactly what piece
you shot that you need in another place.

1488
01:55:11,989 --> 01:55:14,950
That's the Universal back lot,
right there.

1489
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:18,454
And again, Universal back lot.

1490
01:55:19,997 --> 01:55:22,541
DreamWorks kept having meetings
on the Universal back lot,

1491
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:27,129
they kept hearing explosions.
Now we come down to downtown.

1492
01:55:27,213 --> 01:55:30,800
And now we're in the back lot.
See how you can go back and forth.

1493
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:35,179
You really can't tell. That's the back lot,
and now we're downtown.

1494
01:55:57,827 --> 01:56:01,247
Coming up here, these are some
of my favourite shots, right here.

1495
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:05,709
This just takes it to a whole new level.
I wanted these robots not to be,

1496
01:56:05,793 --> 01:56:10,881
what I call "Clunky, fat, f-ing robots."

1497
01:56:10,965 --> 01:56:14,802
That was the lingo
on the animator's desk.

1498
01:56:14,885 --> 01:56:19,723
So we looked at a lot of ninja movies,
karate movies, samurai,

1499
01:56:19,807 --> 01:56:22,476
things like <i>Gladiator.</i>

1500
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,397
We just wanted them to be
warriors that can jump and spin.

1501
01:56:33,112 --> 01:56:36,782
If you look at this scene, right here,
coming up, where he's shooting,

1502
01:56:36,866 --> 01:56:41,370
there's gonna be something
right here on the roof, right there,

1503
01:56:41,453 --> 01:56:42,913
it says "Takara Sushi."

1504
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:45,541
There's actually
a whole bunch of things.

1505
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:49,420
If you actually pause at certain cars,
random cars, you'll see things

1506
01:56:49,545 --> 01:56:53,716
on licence plates. You'll see
Easter eggs all over this movie.

1507
01:56:57,261 --> 01:57:00,931
You'll see different shop signs
that say certain things.

1508
01:57:02,266 --> 01:57:04,852
You'll even see my address
to my house on one of these things.

1509
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,271
I'm not telling you where it is.

1510
01:57:07,396 --> 01:57:10,649
Got the tail number to my plane,
it's 4500 XRAY.

1511
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:16,989
We needed a tail number, so why not
use mine? Sounds good, too.

1512
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:51,792
You always want
to re-do things in movies

1513
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,545
and that prop of the Cube
is kind of lame.

1514
01:58:54,837 --> 01:58:56,672
You know? It's just...

1515
01:58:57,798 --> 01:59:02,803
It's just not what it should be.
But you can't catch everything

1516
01:59:02,886 --> 01:59:06,390
because you've got so many millions
of parts moving on.

1517
01:59:07,808 --> 01:59:11,395
Those Black Hawks
that are flying through downtown,

1518
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,813
it was the only time in my life

1519
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:15,149
I've wanted a religious service
to end quickly,

1520
01:59:15,232 --> 01:59:20,654
because we were not
allowed to fly them close to downtown

1521
01:59:20,738 --> 01:59:24,575
while this religious service was going
on, right where Shia is running towards.

1522
01:59:24,658 --> 01:59:27,494
I was even thinking of offering donations

1523
01:59:27,578 --> 01:59:30,539
so that we could continue shooting.
They didn't wanna buy that.

1524
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:56,690
When you watch this movie,
right here, when you see this,

1525
01:59:56,774 --> 02:00:02,237
you're actually rooting for a truck.
I mean, isn't it silly? But it works.

1526
02:00:03,614 --> 02:00:06,867
And this we did digitally, with
the Porsche Cayenne coming around.

1527
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:11,955
Kind of like that shot that I did on
<i>Bad Boys</i> where I spun around the guys.

1528
02:00:12,081 --> 02:00:15,959
And I've done it subsequently
in <i>The Rock</i> and <i>Armageddon</i>

1529
02:00:16,043 --> 02:00:18,462
and why not do it
with Optimus Prime here?

1530
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:22,716
Now, Megatron was not a big gun
because I just didn't know

1531
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,219
how I would explain
him being a big gun.

1532
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:27,054
Just doesn't make sense.

1533
02:00:29,139 --> 02:00:33,060
Shooting that hotel thing, we shot it
with a little, tiny little helicopter.

1534
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:37,815
With, like a lawnmower engine,
it can take a tiny little camera up

1535
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:40,984
and two guys with remote controls
control it.

1536
02:00:43,278 --> 02:00:46,740
We got a lot of flak
for the face of Megatron.

1537
02:00:46,824 --> 02:00:49,076
He was a little uglier than he is now.

1538
02:00:49,159 --> 02:00:52,996
And the fans, rightly so,
complained about it.

1539
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:56,583
And we kind of fixed the face.
I think he's pretty cool.

1540
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,753
He looks menacing.

1541
02:01:03,841 --> 02:01:07,261
This was done down in Detroit
and then smashing into a real set

1542
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:11,515
here with stuntmen diving out.
But shooting the deli shot,

1543
02:01:11,598 --> 02:01:14,184
it was very complicated because we
had to shoot it against a bluescreen.

1544
02:01:14,268 --> 02:01:17,729
We had to rip up the car, violently,
and we had to throw it,

1545
02:01:17,813 --> 02:01:19,648
once it ripped up, into the window.

1546
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:22,526
So we shoot it, first with people
inside the deli,

1547
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:25,696
then we have Shia run
past the deli window, several times.

1548
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:30,159
Then we rip up the car and we pull it
into the window, right here.

1549
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:33,787
Then we marry them all together
to make it look very dangerous.

1550
02:01:33,871 --> 02:01:36,582
This shot with Starscream landing,
those are real cars

1551
02:01:36,665 --> 02:01:38,709
that are getting flipped violently.

1552
02:01:38,792 --> 02:01:45,507
Simultaneously, they're being pulled
by giant cranes on these canister rigs

1553
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:49,178
that are just extremely violent
when they pull things.

1554
02:01:54,975 --> 02:01:58,937
So imagine no robots there
and just figuring out timing

1555
02:01:59,021 --> 02:02:03,025
of how long that plane's supposed
to transform to it flying out.

1556
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:07,446
I mean, you really,
as you're operating camera,

1557
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:11,366
it's a little bit of guesswork
trying to fit it in.

1558
02:02:14,953 --> 02:02:16,705
There's Ron, you just saw him there,

1559
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:19,374
the African-American
sitting in the chair.

1560
02:02:19,458 --> 02:02:24,963
Ron is homeless
and a very intelligent homeless man.

1561
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:30,844
We offer him money, he doesn't want it.
But he is a huge fan of movies.

1562
02:02:30,928 --> 02:02:35,098
And what he does, he knows everything
about the film industry.

1563
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:37,726
He knows so many people
in the business,

1564
02:02:37,809 --> 02:02:40,020
and he literally becomes a mascot
of the set.

1565
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:44,274
He followed us wherever we went.
He actually rented a car,

1566
02:02:44,358 --> 02:02:47,861
or hitched a way, got a bus ticket,
and he made it to Detroit.

1567
02:02:47,945 --> 02:02:50,364
And we were all surprised
to see him there.

1568
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:52,908
And I told Ian,
"We gotta get him a hotel room."

1569
02:02:52,991 --> 02:02:55,994
And he didn't want it,
but we forced him to take it.

1570
02:02:56,912 --> 02:03:01,667
But Ron's gonna be in all my movies
from now on. He's a great guy.

1571
02:03:03,335 --> 02:03:05,837
That was the train station
down in Detroit.

1572
02:03:05,921 --> 02:03:09,591
It's now gonna be, I think, destroyed, so
this is the last movie to be shot there.

1573
02:03:48,463 --> 02:03:52,342
So we're doing this scene
with these gigantic metal prongs

1574
02:03:52,426 --> 02:03:55,554
that are off the tow truck,
and we're actually backing up

1575
02:03:55,637 --> 02:04:00,642
that tow truck and the driver is Cory
who is dressed as a girl.

1576
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:07,691
He's got a little, cute pink top on.
He looked frightening as a girl.

1577
02:04:36,637 --> 02:04:40,474
And that shot, where we're flipping
the cars up, we have these car flippers

1578
02:04:40,557 --> 02:04:43,518
and it gets as close to possible
and it triggers the car flippers

1579
02:04:43,602 --> 02:04:45,479
as the car comes up.

1580
02:05:11,088 --> 02:05:13,423
Now this scene,
where we did downtown on this rooftop,

1581
02:05:13,507 --> 02:05:18,053
it's about 20 storeys tall.
Shia is escaping from Megatron,

1582
02:05:18,136 --> 02:05:22,265
and he climbs on one of these statues
and Ian Bryce, my producer, goes

1583
02:05:22,349 --> 02:05:23,684
"Well, you gonna do this
bluescreen, right?"

1584
02:05:23,767 --> 02:05:26,603
I said, "No, I wanna do it as real
as possible, let's do it real."

1585
02:05:26,687 --> 02:05:30,023
Let's hang Shia out there,
let's hang him by a wire.

1586
02:05:37,322 --> 02:05:41,910
This is a Black Hawk, actually,
hovering right over an LA building.

1587
02:05:41,993 --> 02:05:46,248
It's kind of an interesting sight having
Black Hawks flying through Los Angeles

1588
02:05:46,331 --> 02:05:48,125
at such low altitude.

1589
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:53,338
Right there, that's the real tail
of a helicopter mock-up

1590
02:05:53,422 --> 02:05:55,132
that comes past Shia.

1591
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:58,760
It's safe because Shia's ducking down,

1592
02:05:58,844 --> 02:06:02,180
but that thing is actually busting
plaster, concrete and whatnot.

1593
02:06:02,264 --> 02:06:06,059
But those are the type of shots
that I like to involve the actor in.

1594
02:06:06,143 --> 02:06:09,938
'Cause it just gives more intensity
and realism to the scene.

1595
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:16,486
I said to Shia, I said, "Shia, I'm gonna
hang you out on this building.

1596
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:20,282
"And there's not a lot of foot room
up there, but you're safe with wires."

1597
02:06:20,365 --> 02:06:23,618
And he says, "Okay, all right, I'm cool,
I'll do it, I'll do it."

1598
02:06:23,702 --> 02:06:27,748
Well, literally the moment before
he was supposed to go up and get on

1599
02:06:27,831 --> 02:06:31,918
this very secured statue
and totally safe wire,

1600
02:06:32,002 --> 02:06:35,172
even though you can't see it,
it's on either side of his hip.

1601
02:06:35,255 --> 02:06:39,634
He goes, "Mike, come here.
I can't do this."

1602
02:06:39,718 --> 02:06:42,763
I said, "Are you kidding me, Shia?
You're gonna embarrass yourself

1603
02:06:42,846 --> 02:06:44,723
"in front of the whole crew."

1604
02:06:45,015 --> 02:06:48,685
Now, mind you, in my own mind,
I would never go out there.

1605
02:06:48,769 --> 02:06:51,772
But I'm a director so I can tell people
to do things like that.

1606
02:06:51,855 --> 02:06:53,690
With all the machismo and whatnot.

1607
02:06:53,774 --> 02:06:55,734
"Dude, you're gonna go out there,
and you're gonna like it.

1608
02:06:55,817 --> 02:06:58,612
"You get paid way more money
than those kids on <i>Fear Factor.</i>

1609
02:06:58,695 --> 02:07:01,948
"So get the hell out there."
So of course he did it.

1610
02:07:02,032 --> 02:07:04,868
It was an awesome shot,
because it's totally real.

1611
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:08,705
And three minutes into doing it,
Shia just loved it.

1612
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:15,504
I was actually supposed to be
hanging out of a Mercedes,

1613
02:07:15,587 --> 02:07:19,549
grabbed by Megatron, and climb out
of the sun roof, which I did.

1614
02:07:19,633 --> 02:07:24,721
And they had me wired by a cable
where they pulled my ankle up,

1615
02:07:24,805 --> 02:07:29,768
and he was supposed to yank me.
But in light of not doing that shot,

1616
02:07:29,851 --> 02:07:33,855
I was the guy that got flicked
by Megatron and goes into the cab.

1617
02:07:33,939 --> 02:07:35,565
So that is me.

1618
02:10:26,236 --> 02:10:29,239
Doing the aerial shots,
basically I'm having my helicopter pilot

1619
02:10:29,364 --> 02:10:34,577
fly with a Vista Vision,
which is a much wider negative,

1620
02:10:34,661 --> 02:10:38,832
larger, so you can move it around a bit.
And he's flying as fast as he can go

1621
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:42,002
through these buildings and around.

1622
02:10:42,085 --> 02:10:43,586
It's kind of, very much

1623
02:10:44,087 --> 02:10:46,756
how we did
some of our <i>Pearl Harbor stuff.</i>

1624
02:10:46,881 --> 02:10:51,594
And I had actually some of the same
plane animators that worked on <i>Pearl</i>

1625
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:53,263
work on this.

1626
02:10:59,728 --> 02:11:03,940
When I went to test screen this movie
with the studio,

1627
02:11:04,065 --> 02:11:08,611
we did it in Arizona,
and we were doing a family theatre

1628
02:11:08,695 --> 02:11:13,199
where it was a bunch of kids
at 5:00, with parents.

1629
02:11:13,283 --> 02:11:16,786
And then we were doing
an adult screening with adults

1630
02:11:16,911 --> 02:11:22,625
at about 8:00, and they
were both 500-person houses.

1631
02:11:22,751 --> 02:11:25,879
So they're very large. What I do
when I put my movies together

1632
02:11:25,962 --> 02:11:29,632
is I actually will put a small group
in a screening room.

1633
02:11:29,716 --> 02:11:33,636
Different-aged kids, where they'll watch
a very rough cut, give me some ideas.

1634
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,972
It's very good to just have to show
your movie up on a bigger screen

1635
02:11:36,056 --> 02:11:39,392
so you can see it
and put it in front of people.

1636
02:11:39,476 --> 02:11:42,729
You can see where they get confused,
what they're liking, what's not working.

1637
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:46,733
So I did that twice.
First started with nine-year-olds to 16.

1638
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:50,570
And then I went from 16 to 25-year-olds.

1639
02:11:50,653 --> 02:11:52,322
And it prepared me
for my studio screening.

1640
02:11:52,405 --> 02:11:55,075
Even being a final cut director,
it's still intense.

1641
02:11:55,158 --> 02:11:56,576
Because they come there

1642
02:11:56,659 --> 02:11:59,245
with 30 people from Paramount
and DreamWorks.

1643
02:11:59,329 --> 02:12:00,914
Everyone is nervous.

1644
02:12:00,997 --> 02:12:04,250
They determine what they're
gonna spend on advertising.

1645
02:12:04,334 --> 02:12:08,171
That very moment, you get numbers.
So we watched it with the families.

1646
02:12:08,296 --> 02:12:10,673
It went well, they were laughing
at the different jokes,

1647
02:12:10,757 --> 02:12:13,259
they were not laughing
at some of the adult jokes.

1648
02:12:13,343 --> 02:12:16,179
There were several applause
through the screening.

1649
02:12:16,304 --> 02:12:19,265
And I'm like,
"That's kind of fun, but odd.

1650
02:12:19,349 --> 02:12:22,769
"They're applauding three or four times
during the screening."

1651
02:12:22,852 --> 02:12:25,522
Then I quickly ran over
to the adult theatre.

1652
02:12:25,647 --> 02:12:28,358
So I saw the adult one start up,
then I ran back to the kids one

1653
02:12:28,483 --> 02:12:31,444
where we did a focus group, 26 people.

1654
02:12:31,528 --> 02:12:34,447
Guy stands up saying,
"I have nothing to do with this movie.

1655
02:12:34,531 --> 02:12:36,032
"How would you rate this movie?"

1656
02:12:36,157 --> 02:12:40,620
Excellent, blah blah blah, very good,
poor, good, whatever.

1657
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:45,875
All 26 hands raised at "Excellent."
And I'm like, "Well, okay, it's a fluke,

1658
02:12:45,959 --> 02:12:48,878
"it's a family thing, whatever."
Then I ran back to the adult screening.

1659
02:12:48,962 --> 02:12:52,799
And I sat next to this guy, I was just
sitting in some random aisle seat

1660
02:12:52,882 --> 02:12:55,468
where I had a little sound box
where I got to control the volume

1661
02:12:55,552 --> 02:13:00,306
because the volume is not really precise
because it's not fully mixed sound.

1662
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:04,394
It's a little abrasive at times.
And the guy knew I was a director

1663
02:13:04,477 --> 02:13:07,397
because I told him,
'cause he asked what that box was.

1664
02:13:07,522 --> 02:13:10,316
Halfway through the movie,
the people are really enjoying it,

1665
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:13,736
you can see the adults are laughing.
And I asked this guy, he was about 30,

1666
02:13:13,862 --> 02:13:17,824
I said, "So do you like
this kind of movie?"

1667
02:13:17,907 --> 02:13:21,494
And he looked at me and goes,
"Not really my thing, not really."

1668
02:13:21,578 --> 02:13:24,664
So I'm thinking, "This movie sucks.
It's just going to be a kids' movie.

1669
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:29,252
"All right, fine. It'll be a kids' movie."
Every emotion goes through your body

1670
02:13:29,335 --> 02:13:32,589
when you're a director
sitting there and watching

1671
02:13:32,672 --> 02:13:35,758
500 people at a time see your movie.

1672
02:13:35,884 --> 02:13:39,179
And they don't care who you are,
what you are, nothing.

1673
02:13:39,262 --> 02:13:43,391
They'll tell you, they'll be frank as...

1674
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:47,854
It can be a brutalizing experience,
because they will tell you

1675
02:13:47,937 --> 02:13:51,191
how bad or good your movie is.
Then we did a focus group

1676
02:13:51,274 --> 02:13:54,944
with the adults and we had
a huge round of applause

1677
02:13:55,028 --> 02:13:57,947
at the end of the movie.
And I'm like, "That's kind of odd.

1678
02:13:58,031 --> 02:14:00,366
"These are adults.
This is a robot movie.

1679
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:04,954
"What are they applauding for?
I thought that this was a kids' movie."

1680
02:14:05,038 --> 02:14:08,374
So we go to this focus group.

1681
02:14:08,458 --> 02:14:12,378
And this woman who is,
I gotta tell you, she was like 40.

1682
02:14:12,462 --> 02:14:15,965
And she says... And this was after
they raised their hands,

1683
02:14:16,049 --> 02:14:21,638
which out of 26 people, 24 of them
raised at "Excellent" and 2, "Very good."

1684
02:14:22,305 --> 02:14:23,806
And I'm thinking,

1685
02:14:23,890 --> 02:14:26,142
"Well, that's kind of odd,
'cause that just never happens."

1686
02:14:26,267 --> 02:14:30,563
That's a lot of people saying "Excellent."

1687
02:14:31,981 --> 02:14:33,983
And this woman raised her hand.

1688
02:14:34,108 --> 02:14:37,487
She says, "I was dragged to this movie.
I didn't want to see this movie."

1689
02:14:37,570 --> 02:14:40,323
And she goes, "But you know what?

1690
02:14:40,406 --> 02:14:44,077
"This movie,
it reinvents the superheroes."

1691
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:47,163
She goes, "I'm tired of the capes
and the suits and all that stuff,

1692
02:14:47,247 --> 02:14:50,667
"and this totally is something new and
different that I've never seen before."

1693
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:52,001
And that's when it kind of hit me.

1694
02:14:52,126 --> 02:14:54,504
And then we got the numbers
from the kids' audience

1695
02:14:54,629 --> 02:15:00,260
which was a 94. That's a huge score.
I've never had that score in my life.

1696
02:15:00,343 --> 02:15:02,011
I mean, that's a massive number.

1697
02:15:02,428 --> 02:15:03,429
Then we got the adult score.

1698
02:15:03,513 --> 02:15:05,515
It was the exact same, 94.

1699
02:15:05,598 --> 02:15:09,018
So obviously the studio
is doing cartwheels.

1700
02:15:09,143 --> 02:15:13,189
I guess it was a good experience
as far as movie testing goes.

1701
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:20,613
The parents here
were something that the audience,

1702
02:15:20,697 --> 02:15:24,951
they all felt, what happened to them?
So this is an additional scene I shot

1703
02:15:25,034 --> 02:15:28,121
just to let people into
what happened to them

1704
02:15:28,204 --> 02:15:30,290
and that they're keeping
this conspiracy going.

1705
02:15:30,373 --> 02:15:32,542
Likewise, they also wanted to know
what happened to Starscream.

1706
02:15:32,667 --> 02:15:35,712
So I added it again,
where you see him go back into space.

1707
02:15:35,795 --> 02:15:39,132
What they told me in that test
was I had to fix this ending.

1708
02:15:39,215 --> 02:15:41,384
And a lot of times, if they don't like
the ending, an audience,

1709
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:44,304
they'll actually be harder
on the grading of the movie.

1710
02:15:44,387 --> 02:15:48,725
But somehow, there was so much
goodwill to this movie, that they...

1711
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:53,062
They still gave it a very high score.

1712
02:15:53,146 --> 02:15:56,399
I had to fix some issues with the Cube.

1713
02:15:56,482 --> 02:16:00,320
I had to show... It was very vague
for them to understand

1714
02:16:00,403 --> 02:16:03,323
what Sam had to do
by pushing the Cube into his chest.

1715
02:16:03,406 --> 02:16:05,158
So we had to do something
by the observatory

1716
02:16:05,241 --> 02:16:09,829
with Optimus showing the spark.
And talking about,

1717
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:14,584
he'll put it into his own chest.
And then we had to do a few more shots

1718
02:16:14,667 --> 02:16:17,170
with Sam pushing it
into Megatron's chest,

1719
02:16:17,253 --> 02:16:20,840
just to clarify the ending.

1720
02:16:20,923 --> 02:16:24,677
It's been a bizarre experience
travelling with this movie

1721
02:16:24,761 --> 02:16:26,429
to so many different countries.

1722
02:16:26,512 --> 02:16:30,099
And even Japan, where I just saw
a screening with 4,500 people.

1723
02:16:30,224 --> 02:16:34,604
In Japan, it's funny, they'll tell you,
"The movie's so funny, it's so funny."

1724
02:16:34,687 --> 02:16:37,106
But you watch it,
and you wanna kill yourself.

1725
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:40,026
Because you got 4,500 people
sitting there, not emoting at all

1726
02:16:40,109 --> 02:16:43,946
because it's impolite to laugh in Japan
when you're watching a movie.

1727
02:16:44,072 --> 02:16:46,282
But then they gave it
huge applause at the end,

1728
02:16:46,366 --> 02:16:49,202
which is something
that they don't do as well.

1729
02:16:49,285 --> 02:16:51,871
And Japanese theatre people

1730
02:16:51,954 --> 02:16:55,458
that are distributors there, they were
just saying, "That's a very good sign."

1731
02:16:55,583 --> 02:16:58,378
So it opens in Japan...
I guess when you get this DVD

1732
02:16:58,461 --> 02:17:03,758
it will have already opened in Japan,
but this is a week before it opens.

1733
02:17:06,469 --> 02:17:10,807
In the Asian countries,
it's just been phenomenal.

1734
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:13,434
I mean, Korea, it's the number
one movie of all time,

1735
02:17:13,643 --> 02:17:16,396
at $50-million something.

1736
02:17:16,646 --> 02:17:19,232
Malaysia, it's the number one movie
of all time.

1737
02:17:19,315 --> 02:17:25,488
It's the biggest opening in China
of all time. It's just crazy.

1738
02:17:25,947 --> 02:17:29,826
<i>Transformers</i> was the most fun
experience I've had directing a movie.

1739
02:17:29,951 --> 02:17:34,414
It was definitely challenging, but a lot
of my movies have been challenging.

1740
02:17:34,497 --> 02:17:39,085
It was a new experience for me
in that working almost like

1741
02:17:39,168 --> 02:17:43,464
on an animation movie with live action.

1742
02:17:45,007 --> 02:17:50,513
I can't wait to get started on <i>2.</i>
The experience of it coming out

1743
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:55,435
and the way it's been accepted around
the world has been staggering to me.

1744
02:17:55,518 --> 02:17:57,687
The fans have...

1745
02:17:57,812 --> 02:18:02,275
The death threats stopped.
I'm very glad, you know?

1746
02:18:02,358 --> 02:18:05,194
I think I've made
a lot of the fans very happy.

1747
02:18:05,278 --> 02:18:09,699
I mean, I know I have. They've told me.

1748
02:18:11,325 --> 02:18:15,288
So many have said, "Thanks for making
my childhood dreams come true."

1749
02:18:15,371 --> 02:18:17,999
It's like they've all dreamed
of this movie.

1750
02:18:19,041 --> 02:18:25,381
So that's a really nice feeling. But it's an
even nicer feeling to see older people

1751
02:18:25,465 --> 02:18:29,635
that knew nothing of <i>Transformers</i>
to actually really enjoy this movie.

1752
02:18:29,719 --> 02:18:32,972
And I'm just proud to have worked
with the people I've worked with.

1753
02:18:33,055 --> 02:18:35,558
And I can't wait to do it again.

1754
02:18:36,726 --> 02:18:40,229
It was a delight to work
with the writers.

1755
02:18:41,481 --> 02:18:44,650
Kurtzman and Orci, I don't know
if they're going to write <i>2,</i>

1756
02:18:44,734 --> 02:18:47,820
because they don't know
if there's any magic left.

1757
02:18:47,904 --> 02:18:50,490
They've gotta be wrong with that,
you know?

1758
02:18:50,823 --> 02:18:56,162
So I'm about to hear many,
many pitches.

1759
02:18:56,245 --> 02:18:58,915
But I know that <i>Transformers 2,</i>
if I do it,

1760
02:18:58,998 --> 02:19:02,585
I definitely want to take it
to a whole other visual level.

1761
02:19:03,753 --> 02:19:08,883
I think this movie has definitely
raised the bar of visual effects.

1762
02:19:09,592 --> 02:19:13,513
In terms of realistic visual effects
and what can be done.

1763
02:19:13,596 --> 02:19:17,350
It's almost anything what a director
thinks can be done, nowadays.

1764
02:19:18,267 --> 02:19:21,771
It's amazing how effects jump
every single year.

1765
02:19:23,731 --> 02:19:27,944
I'll look forward to doing it again.
So thanks for listening to me.

1766
02:19:29,445 --> 02:19:34,367
Some of it, I hope I'm not blabbing.
It's hard to sit in a dark room, right here,

1767
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:38,287
with a microphone in front of you
and talk for three hours.

1768
02:19:39,539 --> 02:19:41,582
Till next time, see you.
