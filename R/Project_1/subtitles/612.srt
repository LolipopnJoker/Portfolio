1
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,145
<i>Imagine me and you
I do</i>

2
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,483
<i>I think about you day and night
It's only right</i>

3
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,411
<i>To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight</i>

4
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:42,958
<i>So happy together</i>

5
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,332
<i>If I should call you up
Invest a dime</i>

6
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,461
<i>And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind</i>

7
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,295
<i>Imagine how the world could be
So very fine</i>

8
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,678
<i>So happy together...</i>

9
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,811
- Honey, wake up.
- No.

10
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,230
Anna, greet the day.

11
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,643
<i>For all my life</i>

12
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,398
<i>Me and you
And you and me</i>

13
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,151
<i>No matter how they toss the dice
It has to be</i>

14
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,153
<i>The only one for me is you
And you for me</i>

15
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:20,154
Anna, honey, you've gotta wake up.

16
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:25,747
<i>I can't see me loving nobody but you
For all my life</i>

17
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,247
<i>When you're with me, baby</i>

18
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,162
That's it.

19
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,594
I have had it!

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,476
- Anna, hurry up!
- What? I'm ready.

21
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,612
- Settle on a station, please.
- OK.

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,152
I'm gonna get a little stud
right here, OK?

23
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,364
I don't want my maid of honor
looking like a harlot.

24
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,828
Come on, Mom.
Everyone's got one.

25
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,202
Everyone? Harry, everyone has one.

26
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,625
I can't believe you.
You're ruining my life.

27
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,957
You know what?
End of discussion.

28
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,545
Feet down.

29
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:15,292
- OK, if I can drive.
- Fine. Did you bring your permit?

30
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,381
No, I can't find it.

31
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,430
- You can't find it?
- What did you do with it, troll?

32
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,550
Anna, why do you always blame him
for everything?

33
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,887
- He couldn't find anything in your room.
- Why do you always take his side?

34
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,017
- Anna.
- No, why?

35
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,602
Let's not do this again, please.

36
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,392
And fix your shirt.

37
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,979
- Look, there's Stacey Hinkhouse.
- Joy.

38
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,071
- Hi, Stacey.
- Hi, Mrs. Coleman.

39
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,867
- Congratulations on your big day.
- Thanks, say hi to your mom for me.

40
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,195
- OK, bye!
- OK, bye. Hi, girls!

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,913
You never see Stacey anymore.

42
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,082
- How is she?
- Evil. She hates me now.

43
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,578
Why? Would you leave
your brother alone?

44
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,664
See! She always starts it.

45
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,385
Bye, honey! Make good choices.

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,138
<i>So get out of my face, don't even try
Ya wanna help me</i>

47
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,971
- She had the same shirt?
- Yeah, but this looks OK, right?

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,013
- The style?
- Sure.

49
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,311
- So, it's cool.
- Definitely not.

50
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,190
- Oh, kill me!
- Anna, what?

51
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,812
I can't believe it, it's Jake.

52
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,612
He's gonna think I'm stupid.
I can't even put on a shirt.

53
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,945
You've never even met the guy,
so, guess what, he doesn't care.

54
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,495
- He's not even looking.
- He's not?

55
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,997
He's not look...
He's totally looking.

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,457
- I think he's gonna talk to you.
- Shut up.

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,137
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

58
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:47,430
Why would I want a leprechaun
ice sculpture? I'm not even Irish.

59
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,306
Could you hold on a second?

60
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,937
<i>¡Señora, cuidado, cuidado!</i>

61
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,650
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry, sir.

62
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,802
Mr. Bates, I really don't
understand this F.

63
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,670
You completely missed the point
of the book.

64
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:29,551
It's "1984." How could anyone miss it?
It's a blatant attack on totalitarianism.

65
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,597
About a rigid society, dominated by
one all-powerful ego-tripping dictator.

66
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,728
My grade is final.

67
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,519
Except he had hair.

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,899
Anna!

69
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,707
Hello, Anna.

70
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,039
What do you have today?

71
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,082
- Meatloaf.
- Turkey.

72
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,393
Evan, I'm so sorry.
I had some car trouble.

73
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,312
OK, I thought you forgot about me.

74
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,315
I could never forget about you, Evan.
I see you every day.

75
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,187
What about tomorrow?

76
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,610
Is this new? Am I gonna
see you tomorrow?

77
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,572
You're gonna see me tomorrow,
but not next week

78
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,029
because, remember,
I'm going on my honeymoon.

79
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,281
Oh, my God.
You're not coming back.

80
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,866
All my therapists quit on me.

81
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,665
I'm not gonna quit on you.
I'll be available on my cell phone.

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,748
I checked, there's no service on
the north side of the island.

83
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,133
- It will be fine.
- OK.

84
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,092
I've had a better week. You're counting
the minutes, aren't you?

85
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,177
No.

86
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,514
- How many minutes are left?
- 54.

87
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,728
This morning was good,
but then I got up.

88
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,363
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

89
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,903
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

90
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,705
<i>Last call
Now I'm outta time</i>

91
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,623
<i>And I don't got no Valentine</i>

92
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,750
- Yeah!
- All right!

93
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,081
<i>I just need a little therapy</i>

94
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,336
<i>At least that's what they say to me</i>

95
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,420
<i>Hey, ho
Let's go</i>

96
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,473
<i>I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it</i>

97
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,198
Great.

98
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,571
No, absolutely not.
I said no salmon.

99
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,122
No, it has to be halibut.

100
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,575
I don't care about the extra cost.

101
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,748
How much is it?

102
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,961
Hold on one second.

103
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,003
Hello. Hi, Harry.

104
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,636
No, you may not touch the power tools.

105
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,219
Yes, I would consider
the lawn mower to be a power tool.

106
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,259
OK, I'll see you at home.

107
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,720
OK, halibut...

108
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,433
Could you hold on one second?
Hello, Dr. Coleman.

109
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,279
Yes, Elizabeth,
I'll be at the appointment tomorrow.

110
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,315
OK, good.

111
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,985
And Elizabeth,
remember, you are a smart, strong,

112
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,741
beautiful, independent woman

113
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,406
and you don't need a man
to complete you.

114
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,037
Thank you.

115
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,086
Goodbye.

116
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,762
Uh, excuse me.

117
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,933
- Is this yours?
- Thanks.

118
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,024
Fender medium. So, what do you play?

119
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,447
I play my dad's old Telecaster.

120
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,940
Nice.

121
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,111
- Cute shirt.
- Thanks.

122
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,285
You're in a band?

123
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,410
- Sort of.
- What do you mean, sort of?

124
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,536
You know, we're still stuck
in our garage phase, so...

125
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,713
OK. Well, if you ever
get out of your garage...

126
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,756
- Let me know.
- Yeah, totally.

127
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,877
You can come check me out.
I mean, the band.

128
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,008
I mean I'll be there too,
if you wanna come check...

129
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,549
- I'm Anna.
- Jake.

130
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,185
So, what do you say?

131
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,264
- You want a ride?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

132
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,517
Here you go,
you can wear my extra helmet.

133
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,567
Oh, I just realized,
I have to meet my friends.

134
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,148
- They're waiting for me.
- Your mom would kill you.

135
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,322
So dead, and so grounded.

136
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,742
I get it. Moms and motorcycles...

137
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,078
Yeah. So, um, see you around.

138
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,962
Anna.

139
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,250
Listen, you like The Hives?

140
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,386
- They're awesome.
- Look, I've got this import.

141
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:20,217
- If you want, we could get together...
- Coleman!

142
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,762
One second.

143
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:31,106
If I were you, I would be thinking
a little less about boys

144
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,610
and a little more
about your honors qualifying exam.

145
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,816
I'm ready for the test, Mr. Bates.

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,405
"Prepared" is to "you"
as "not" is to "test".

147
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,248
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

148
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,155
What are you doing? Get out of my room!

149
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,238
Help me!

150
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,991
Mommy! Stop, Anna!

151
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,541
- ...on the second verse.
- There she is.

152
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,790
Hey, what happened?

153
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,258
Nothing, just taking care of my brother.

154
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,260
<i>Yeah</i>

155
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,930
<i>Yeah</i>

156
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,897
<i>Get up, get out</i>

157
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,694
<i>Move on, move on
There's no doubt</i>

158
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,646
<i>I'm all wrong
You're right</i>

159
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,072
<i>It's all the same with you</i>

160
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,736
Thank you.

161
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,206
- Mommy, mommy, mommy!
- Come here.

162
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,659
Oh, sweetheart.

163
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,495
Ready? I'm gonna give
a one, two, three...

164
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,003
No. Ready? One, two, three...

165
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,584
Honey, go back inside.
I'll be right there.

166
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,465
Anna!

167
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,135
<i>Round and round
Here we go again</i>

168
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,596
<i>Same old start
Same old end</i>

169
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,058
<i>Turn my head
Turn back again</i>

170
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,063
<i>Same old stuff never ends</i>

171
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,320
<i>Do this...</i>

172
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,733
Hold still, honey.

173
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,490
I promise you, there will be
serious consequences for her.

174
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,196
Hey, Tessie!

175
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,452
Dad, you're early!

176
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,283
- What?
- You're early.

177
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,993
I can't hear...

178
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,288
You're... early.

179
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,249
Hold on, I need my glasses.

180
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,211
- Grandpa!
- Hey, monkey!

181
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,969
What is this?
One of them thongs?

182
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,348
I don't want to know.

183
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,559
What's up?

184
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,806
- Hey, you guys.
- You know these yard apes?

185
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,725
- You're early.
- What?

186
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,059
Glad you could make it.

187
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,733
- I brought an early wedding present.
- What?

188
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,943
- I thought I'd get the author to sign it.
- What?

189
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,413
- I thought I'd ask the author...
- I can't hear you. Hold on.

190
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,997
Come on, let's get out of here.

191
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,834
What do you have under your shirt?
Ryan, could you...

192
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,584
<i>On and on and on and on</i>

193
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,463
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

194
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,091
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

195
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,264
<i>I wanna shout out</i>

196
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,843
<i>Take me away, away, away</i>

197
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:57,025
<i>Away, away-ay-ay</i>

198
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,959
- Bummer!
- Not again.

199
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,786
Time's up. It's after six!

200
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,126
Guys, you're gonna spoil your dinner.

201
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,844
You know, this dad thing
could be hard or easy.

202
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,100
Don't let her see you.

203
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,523
Good, now we can hear.

204
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,896
Speak for yourself.
I could use those little notes.

205
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,398
She hates it when I pull the plug,
so get ready for the fireworks.

206
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,991
- Did I say hello?
- I must've missed it.

207
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,364
- Hello.
- Hello.

208
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,113
Get a room!

209
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,160
Go, go, go!

210
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,842
This is...

211
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,137
- Just one second.
- OK, but you owe me.

212
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,555
Hello.

213
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,724
Yes, this is she.

214
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,937
Oh, really?

215
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,982
OK. Great, thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

216
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,406
- What?
- You'll never believe this.

217
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,451
One of the bands dropped out
of the Wango Tango auditions,

218
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,698
- and we are the first alternates.
- Shut up!

219
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,493
That's awesome!

220
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,164
We have to check in at the House
of Blues by 7:00 and we're on at 7:45.

221
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,877
- When is it?
- Tomorrow.

222
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,249
- Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Friday.
- So?

223
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,628
That's my mom's rehearsal dinner.

224
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,377
Anna, come on,
this is really important.

225
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,630
Don't worry. I'll work it out.
I'll be there.

226
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,182
How can you? Aren't you
the maid of horror or something?

227
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,764
Honor, and it's not the wedding,
it's the rehearsal.

228
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,641
Don't they make a big deal
out of the rehearsal?

229
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,685
Like, all your weird relatives
coming to town?

230
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,440
No, they don't.

231
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,186
There's my Anna-banana.

232
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,692
Come on, give your Grampie-doodle
a big huggie-bug here!

233
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,316
- Come on.
- Grandpa, over here.

234
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,785
- Oh...
- Hey, Gramps.

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,415
Don't worry. I'd never let you guys down.
Don't cancel the audition yet, OK?

236
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,293
- I'm gonna talk to my mom.
- All right.

237
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,041
- We're screwed.
- Yep.

238
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,676
Yeah...

239
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,058
"I don't think he knows
I even exist."

240
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,687
"It's so stupid to think about him,
but I can't help it."

241
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,943
Jake, oh, Jake!

242
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,362
Get out of my room!

243
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,947
Get out!

244
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,948
Oh! My... My... Mom!

245
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,326
- She saw it.
- I'm gonna check out those Lakers.

246
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,782
I'm with you.

247
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,374
Mom, did you see
what happened to my...

248
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,084
- I spoke to your principal.
- What?

249
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,762
- Just now, on the phone.
- Where's my door?

250
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,179
- Privacy is a privilege, Anna.
- Where's my door, Mom?

251
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,978
Your door will be returned to you,
Anna, if and when you...

252
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,647
I need my door! Give me that door or...
I will kill myself!

253
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,600
Oh! Can I watch?

254
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,692
- Harry!
- Shut up!

255
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,735
I think we can dispense with the drama.

256
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,861
Maybe you can calmly explain to me
why you were in detention twice today.

257
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,910
OK, I went to detention, but only
because Stacey Hinkhouse

258
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,662
kept hitting me with a volleyball.

259
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,579
When is this conflict with Stacey
Hinkhouse going to end?

260
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,631
Never, because she's an insane,
psycho freak.

261
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,297
You'd know that if you paid
a speck of attention.

262
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,877
- Anna.
- What?

263
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,630
I think you know I pay attention, Anna.

264
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,637
Enough to know that
you got an F in English today.

265
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,887
- Mr. Bates is out to get me.
- Oh, him, too?

266
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,481
Yeah! He looks for ways to torture me.

267
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,856
Like today, the one time Jake
even spoke to me, he totally...

268
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,905
- Who's Jake?
- He's just... nobody.

269
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,701
You say I'm not interested, Anna.
I'm interested. Try me.

270
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,748
OK, he's just this really amazing guy.

271
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,584
- Where'd you meet him?
- Detention, but...

272
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,084
That's promising.

273
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,007
See, why do I even bother
telling you anything?

274
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,460
OK! Who's up for Chinese?

275
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,463
You're ruining my life!

276
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,471
I'm moving out! I'm never coming back
ever, ever, ever again!

277
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,402
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, Pei-Pei.

278
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,784
Anna, Harry, you so big now!
What happen?

279
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,866
- Are you happy for your mommy?
- About what?

280
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,793
Oh.
She's such a joker!

281
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,421
Who's catering?
Chinese food good luck.

282
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,999
- It's planned already.
- OK, how 'bout me?

283
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,593
Anna, I pre-ordered the Peking Duck.

284
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,420
Joy!

285
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,722
- I know that's your favorite.
- Whatever.

286
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,716
- The wedding's in two days.
- Think about it, OK?

287
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,848
- OK.
- See you soon. Happy dining.

288
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,225
Your door is underneath the back stairs.

289
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,061
Like I didn't figure that out.

290
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,063
Stop groveling. Let her come to you.

291
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,901
She'd come with a hatchet.

292
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,943
Think I'll go check on that duck.

293
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:45,993
Anna.

294
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,666
Do you really think your surliness
is the best way to get what you want?

295
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,884
I'm sorry, Mom.
I really have been stressing in school.

296
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,137
I deserved every one
of those trips to detention.

297
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,719
I'm gonna apologize
to Stacey Hinkhouse and Mr. Bates.

298
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,274
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I'll try and do better, Mom.

299
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,859
I'll really, really try.

300
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,904
- What do you want?
- To go to this important audition

301
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,073
tomorrow night that we can never
have again at the House of Blues.

302
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,692
An audition, that's great!

303
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,577
Tomorrow, you mean
after the rehearsal dinner?

304
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:30,292
- Well, during, but...
- You mean, as instead of?

305
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,959
You mean, technically?

306
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,626
- I need to talk to you right now.
- I think I'm gonna pass on that.

307
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,089
Now!

308
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:43,305
Anna, I am going to make
one final attempt

309
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,259
to understand what goes on
in your head.

310
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,435
- Don't treat me like a patient.
- What?

311
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,355
All calm and reasonable, and,
"I really want to understand."

312
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,148
I really do want to understand!

313
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:58,149
Mama, stay out of it, please.

314
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,110
- Mama!
- OK fine.

315
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,154
They're gonna pick one local band
to play at Wango Tango.

316
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,406
We were lucky to even make this cut.

317
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,030
It's a once in a lifetime chance, Mom.
Please.

318
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,031
Why can't I just go? Please.

319
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:15,037
What I hear is that my special night
means absolutely nothing to you.

320
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,627
I don't even have to ask if my band
means anything to you.

321
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,504
It's clear to us that
you think we're all noise.

322
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,543
Look, I'm a walrus.

323
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,676
- I do not.
- Do, too.

324
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,758
- I let you practice in the garage.
- Mom!

325
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,141
- Anna, stop.
- What?

326
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,393
Let's talk about
what this is really about.

327
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,110
- This is about your dad, isn't it?
- Mom, stop shrinking me.

328
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,815
It's not about dad. It's about
the audition. You're ruining my life!

329
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,986
Enough with the drama.
High school is not that hard.

330
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,492
You couldn't last one day
in my high school.

331
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,290
Actually, I could,
and without getting a detention.

332
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,290
I'm sorry I'm the one thing
in your life that isn't perfect.

333
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,670
- You think my life is perfect?
- I know your life is perfect.

334
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,845
Your perfect job, perfect boyfriend,
perfect patients who worship you...

335
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,425
You need a serious reality-check
if you think my life is perfect.

336
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,021
- Cut me some slack, just this once.
- I'm beyond cutting you slack, Anna.

337
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,182
But you are not going to the audition.

338
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,519
- Yes, I am!
- No, you're not!

339
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,401
- Why not?
- Because I said so.

340
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,354
Cookie?

341
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,115
- This isn't really a good time.
- Now good time.

342
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,795
OK, thank you.

343
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,426
Anna.

344
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:50,549
For one day, the entirety of our life
is not going to be focused on you.

345
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,475
It's all about Ryan now, isn't it?

346
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,266
Anna!

347
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,440
- Get away.
- Honey...

348
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,155
"A journey soon begins."

349
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,284
"It's prize reflected
in another's eyes."

350
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,578
"When what you see
is what you lack,

351
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,627
"then selfless love
will change you back."

352
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,003
Whatever.

353
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,641
Honey.

354
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,811
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

355
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,560
Come on.

356
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,673
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

357
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,748
There was an earthquake.

358
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,168
- No, there wasn't.
- Yes, there was.

359
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,463
- What are they talking about?
- An earthquake.

360
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,138
- An earthquake?
- No, there was no earthquake.

361
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,308
You didn't feel it?

362
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,180
No, I don't think so.

363
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,574
<i>6:45 already.</i>

364
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,198
<i>I didn't get the dry cleaning.</i>

365
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,782
<i>I'll have to do that on the way home.
And call the mechanic, and the florist.</i>

366
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,785
<i>OK, I better get up.</i>

367
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,869
<i>I'd better...</i>

368
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,883
<i>Why am I in Anna's room?</i>

369
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,174
<i>What happened last night?</i>

370
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,889
<i>Did... did I pass out in here?</i>

371
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,931
<i>I have no memory of this.
This isn't mine.</i>

372
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,897
<i>Those aren't mine.</i>

373
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,609
<i>That's not mine.</i>

374
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,071
<i>That's definitely not mine.</i>

375
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,119
- Anna, come here quick.
- What?

376
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,327
- Mom's dead.
- I'm dead.

377
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,091
Come on, hurry.

378
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,844
See, she's not moving.

379
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,800
Oh, my God.

380
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,724
No, wait. It's breathing.

381
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,181
- I'm not dead.
- What?

382
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,228
Uh...

383
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,858
Right, ah... Her chest is moving.

384
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,400
Honey, see?

385
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,195
You called me "honey".

386
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,744
- Right, um...
- Are you sick?

387
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:44,374
I hope so, or dreaming, or...

388
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,454
Hon... Harry, go get
your own breakfast.

389
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,832
You can eat Anna's cereal... my cereal.

390
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,132
Cool.

391
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,548
Hello.

392
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,762
Hello in there.

393
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,307
Wake up, honey.

394
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,225
Wake up.

395
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,019
Wake up!

396
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,768
That is it.

397
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:28,536
Could I just have,
like, one minute, please?

398
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,791
Honey, look, I think
something's happened to us.

399
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,712
- What are you?
- It's me. Mom.

400
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,557
- You're not my mother.
- Yes, I am.

401
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,019
- Get away, you clone freak!
- Don't you use that tone with me.

402
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,440
Oh, my God,
you are my mother.

403
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,399
And you're not who you think you are.

404
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,659
- Look at me.
- I know. We seem to be inside...

405
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,534
- I'm old!
- I beg your pardon.

406
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,418
I'm like the Crypt Keeper!

407
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,666
OK, that's enough.

408
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,173
I want my body back.

409
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,090
And I don't want mine?
My wedding's tomorrow.

410
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,300
Oh, my God, my wedding's tomorrow.

411
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,307
I can't marry Ryan! Ew!

412
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,054
OK, OK, OK...

413
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,225
- OK, what?
- I have no idea.

414
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,360
Mom, maybe we should go
to the emergency room.

415
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,276
Oh no, all that'll get us
is a 72-hour lockdown

416
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,695
in the psych ward and a Thorazine drip.

417
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,869
- No, we're not going anywhere.
- OK...

418
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,662
Um...

419
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,659
So, you're in my body
and I'm in your body.

420
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,160
Why don't we, like...

421
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,792
Yes, I see what you're saying.

422
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,546
A jolt. OK, you go over there
and I go over here.

423
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,095
- Now when I say go... Ready?
- Yeah.

424
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,718
Go!

425
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,931
- Hey, Mom...
- Ow...

426
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,597
- Ow. OK, that was stupid.
- Oh.

427
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,689
Harry... Uh,

428
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,112
I was just teaching Mom
some new dance moves.

429
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,940
What do you want, punk?

430
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,497
You cannot talk to him like that.
He thinks you're his mother.

431
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,662
We're going to have to tell him some time.

432
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,118
We're not going to tell him.

433
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,704
We're not going to tell anyone.
They'll think we're crazy.

434
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,425
- Maybe we are crazy.
- I, for one, am not crazy.

435
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,877
I'm merely a grown woman
trapped in my daughter's body.

436
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,966
Oh, God, I am crazy.

437
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,198
Grandpa, could you pass the milk?

438
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,698
OK, Harry's still Harry
and Grandpa's still Grandpa.

439
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,407
- So, it's just us? What did we do wrong?
- I don't know.

440
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,033
Grandpa, pass the milk!

441
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,083
- Grandpa, pass the milk!
- Earthquake!

442
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,630
Earthquake!

443
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,837
Earthquake! House of Chang!

444
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,926
- Nobody felt it but us!
- Earthquake! Earthquake!

445
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,969
Honey!

446
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,979
OK, I'll take it.

447
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,563
I guess you're not that ready yet, huh?

448
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:41,936
Uh...

449
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,487
Sweetheart, what are you doing here?

450
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,614
I thought you said
you needed a ride to work.

451
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:52,284
Right, um... Mom.

452
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,411
I guess you better hurry up.

453
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,992
Get a grip. I am not...

454
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,291
Darling...

455
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,802
could you, like, chill for a sec?

456
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:12,133
Sure, I'll... chill.

457
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,387
- Get going.
- I'll, like, go get your dad.

458
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,889
Alan, that's not our car.

459
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,021
The earthquake,
then Pei-Pei's crazy mother,

460
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:24,980
- pointing at me and pointing at you.
- What was she mumbling in Chinese?

461
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:28,608
She did something.
Some strange Asian voodoo.

462
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,073
What are we going to do now?
I can't go to school like this.

463
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,077
You have to.
You're on the verge of suspension, Anna.

464
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,074
And you have
your honors qualifying exam today.

465
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,745
All the more reason to stay home.

466
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,458
I could go and take the exam for you.

467
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,168
I'm sure a high school-level test
would be quite simple for me.

468
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,505
Are you kidding?
You think you can be me?

469
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,723
Of course I can. Watch me.

470
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,553
"Oh, everyone's out to get me.
You're ruining my life!"

471
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,019
It's easy to be you.
I'll suck the fun out of everything.

472
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,605
- I do not suck the fun out of everything.
- Fun-sucker!

473
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,734
This is ridiculous. I will go to school
and you will stay right...

474
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,823
- What?
- Evan.

475
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:12,156
- Evan? Who's Evan?
- My neediest patient.

476
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,324
I've been seeing him every day
for the past three years.

477
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,947
Oh, bummer.

478
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,000
Maybe just my face would be reassuring.

479
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,918
No. No way. Uh-uh.

480
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,588
I am not baby-sitting
some 40-year-old whack-job.

481
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,961
- What do I say to the freak?
- Nothing.

482
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,757
You are in no way
to give anyone any advice.

483
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,757
That would be unethical. Just listen
attentively, nod occasionally,

484
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,057
and if you must speak, simply say,
"How do you feel about that?"

485
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,142
You're serious?

486
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,770
You really want us to be each other?

487
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,644
Well, we'll get through
this morning as each other,

488
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,522
and then go back to the restaurant
at lunch and get switched back.

489
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,068
Now go get dressed.

490
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,359
Good luck getting dressed
without a door.

491
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,824
Thank you.

492
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,246
- Oh, boy.
- You'll get used to it.

493
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,497
What?

494
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,335
You pierced your navel?

495
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,381
Yeah, I meant
to talk to you about that.

496
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:14,222
- When did you do this?
- At Maddie's cousin's Sweet 16.

497
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,640
When you get your body back,
it's grounded.

498
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,802
What are you doing?

499
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,513
I don't know why you never wear these.
They're so cute.

500
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,396
Yeah, if you're selling Bibles.
What'd you do to my hair?

501
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,269
Oh, I've been dying to comb
these rats out for months.

502
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,071
Now you can see your pretty face.
What is this?

503
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,781
Oh. Fixed your jeans.

504
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,912
My patients are not going to pay $150
an hour to get therapy from a stripper.

505
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,865
- All right, I'll drab up.
- I'll grunge down.

506
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:42,579
Go.

507
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,328
What's that?

508
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,006
Ugh!

509
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,348
Feet down.

510
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,932
- Harry, could you settle down, please?
- Bite me.

511
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,309
Do you see what he does
behind your back?

512
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,363
- Mom...
- Excuse me.

513
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,909
While I'm apologizing,
let me just say to the whole car

514
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,285
how truly sorry I am for being
such an insane control-freak all the time.

515
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,578
You're not controlling, Mom.

516
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,036
I'm the one who should be apologizing

517
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,963
for my flagrant disregard
for anyone's feelings but my own.

518
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:32,667
Well, at least you have
a great sense of style.

519
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,883
- Not like me.
- Enough.

520
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:38,298
- Ooh, platinum. Cool.
- Don't even think about it.

521
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,972
Am I supposed to follow this?

522
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,187
It's nothing... darling.

523
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,778
One more day.

524
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,236
Yeah, it's great
we're getting married, isn't it?

525
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,494
Even though my husband died.
How quickly I was able to get over it.

526
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,747
Just pull up here. Mom, out of the car.

527
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,218
- If you alienate Ryan in my body...
- I'll be nice.

528
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,169
Don't kiss him.

529
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,882
Mom, I just had breakfast.
That's disgusting.

530
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,931
Nice. OK, here's the number
for a cab company.

531
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,980
- I want you back here at 11:45 sharp.
- All right.

532
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,891
- Do you understand?
- All right.

533
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,727
What is that tone?
Are you using a tone with me?

534
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,364
Oh, my God.

535
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,819
- Uh, can I go?
- What are you so anxious about?

536
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,411
Hey, Anna.

537
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,871
Do you know him?

538
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,367
Um...

539
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,168
Kinda, that's Jake.

540
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,622
- No. No!
- You gotta give him a chance.

541
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,129
That is the last thing I'll give him.
Just look at him.

542
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,386
- You don't even know him.
- I know he's too old for you.

543
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,173
Oh my God, he's coming over.
Say hi back.

544
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,392
- No!
- Say hi or I'll break up with Ryan.

545
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,514
- Hi, Jake.
- Hi.

546
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,268
So...

547
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:14,231
Oh, um... This is my mother,
Dr. Coleman.

548
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,147
Hi.

549
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,445
- That's a great bike.
- What?

550
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,198
It's not like I've ever been on it.
I'm not allowed.

551
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,665
I mean, I'm allowed because I'm old.

552
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,543
I gotta go.

553
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,424
Bye.

554
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,468
Walk with him.

555
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,307
Harry, do you know who that is?

556
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,934
Anna's got a boyfriend.

557
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,937
K- I-S-S-I-N-G.

558
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,771
OK, where are we going next?
Harry's school?

559
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,111
He can walk from here.

560
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,827
- It's 20 blocks.
- Fresh air'll do you good.

561
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,864
- What about bullies?
- Run fast.

562
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,325
Tess, look, it's no trouble
to drive him.

563
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,746
Whatever.

564
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:25,757
- Hey. I've got The Hives for you.
- I beg your pardon?

565
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,468
- The CD.
- Oh, yeah, that.

566
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,894
They're coming to town next week.
I was wondering if maybe...

567
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:34,975
That's a nice thought. I'm sure
with a haircut you'd look presentable,

568
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,983
but I need to focus on schoolwork.

569
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,445
Truth be told,
you're way too old for me.

570
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,983
But thanks anyway, Jason.

571
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,276
It's Jake.

572
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,278
Ugh.

573
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,660
Hello. Good morning.

574
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,825
Good morning. Hi.

575
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,459
Hello.

576
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,293
Stacey, hi, how are you?

577
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,212
Oh, wonderful!

578
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,465
Stacey, what are you doing?

579
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,307
Ow!

580
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,968
Run away!

581
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,354
Are you OK, Anna?

582
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,562
I am appalled that Stacey
would do something like that.

583
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,313
- Yeah, shocker.
- I am going to be calling her mother.

584
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,276
Forget about that. We'll get her later.

585
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,783
- So, we saw you.
- Saw me what?

586
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,243
- With Jake.
- Give us the dirty details.

587
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,120
- Excuse me?
- Did you make a move?

588
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,374
- Is that something I would do?
- It's something you should do.

589
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,455
Oh, no, no, no.

590
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,247
I don't believe in physical contact
with the opposite sex.

591
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,922
At all, ever.

592
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,418
Nothing. And you girls would do well
to follow my example.

593
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,643
- Well...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

594
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,150
- What?
- Uh, cold sore.

595
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,481
- Where?
- I feel it coming on. A big one.

596
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:10,036
- I don't care.
- I'm thinking of you, really. You.

597
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,112
OK. OK.

598
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,198
Good thing, I guess.

599
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,292
Need a ride home
or are you gonna pick up the Volvo?

600
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:23,007
Oh, I will most definitely
be picking up the Volvo.

601
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,678
<i>Hey</i>

602
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,263
<i>Hey</i>

603
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,683
<i>A- ha</i>

604
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,394
<i>What I like about you</i>

605
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,484
<i>You really know how to dance</i>

606
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,525
<i>When you're going up, down
Jump around</i>

607
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,702
<i>- Talk about true romance
- ASSISTANT: Oh!</i>

608
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,491
<i>Yeah</i>

609
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,119
<i>Keep on whispering in my ear</i>

610
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,042
<i>Tell me all the things
that I wanna hear</i>

611
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,335
<i>Cause it's true
That's what I like about you</i>

612
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,416
<i>What I like about you</i>

613
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,509
<i>A- ha</i>

614
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,142
<i>Hey! Ow!</i>

615
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,942
<i>Keep on whispering in my ear</i>

616
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,314
<i>Tell me all the things
that I wanna hear</i>

617
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,694
<i>Cause it's true
That's what I like about you</i>

618
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:32,068
<i>What I like
That's what I like about you</i>

619
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,369
<i>- Hey, how's it going?
- What I like about, hey</i>

620
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,573
Oh!

621
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,685
Dr. Coleman's office.

622
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,814
<i>This is Dr. Dunn's office. I'm calling
to confirm your root canal appointment.</i>

623
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,404
Root canal? That's not fair.
They're not my teeth.

624
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,402
<i>OK, I'm not sure...</i>

625
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:15,069
- No, I'm cutting the dentist.
- You mean you're cancelling?

626
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,157
Yeah, cancel. Like I'm gonna take
that bullet, please.

627
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,460
- Evan.
- No, Boris.

628
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,133
Line 27.

629
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,585
- Thanks.
- There you go.

630
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,429
Whoa! She's blind!

631
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,392
This sucks.

632
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,846
- You wanna get that?
- No way.

633
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,977
I'm not answering that thing again.

634
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,234
- Good to see ya.
- OK.

635
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,856
You're here.

636
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,364
Um, yeah. I'm here and you're here.

637
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,621
You look fantastic. Why,
are you cancelling the session?

638
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,490
- No, Kevin.
- Evan!

639
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,830
Evan. Evan.

640
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:08,248
- So, shall we go in here and do it?
- Are you gonna get that?

641
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,461
- No.
- So, you don't answer your phone.

642
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,639
I told you I wouldn't be able
to call you on your honeymoon,

643
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,468
- but you lied to me. You're a liar.
- Know what? I'll get it.

644
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,145
Yo.

645
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,726
What?

646
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,525
$10,000? For what?

647
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,860
Halibut! Ew!

648
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,818
What kind of caterer are you?

649
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,991
It's disgusting.

650
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,943
Well, I'm not gonna pay for it.

651
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,329
Fine, don't show up.
See if I care.

652
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,208
Yeah, I'm cancelling.

653
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,953
Yeah, well, same to you, dude.

654
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,621
- So, Ethan...
- Evan!

655
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,208
Evan. I knew that.

656
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,310
Bates. I've seen him before.
Where have I seen him before?

657
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,309
Like, every day in this torture chamber.

658
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,265
So, did you talk to your mom?

659
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,235
Today is a lovely day...

660
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,939
for a pop quiz!

661
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,442
All of you should have finished
reading "Hamlet" by now.

662
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,161
I'm going to ask each one of you
one question.

663
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,164
And you will be graded
according to your answer.

664
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,792
Thank God it's "Hamlet".
I was in that play in high...

665
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,252
- I just... I know the play.
- Like, that'll help you.

666
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,965
Mr. Waters.

667
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,635
Describe the character of Hamlet.

668
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,597
Um...

669
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:45,724
Hamlet... is, uh...
one of the big characters.

670
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,854
I mean, he's Hamlet.

671
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:49,602
Um...

672
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,693
He's just... boppin' around.

673
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,146
Doesn't know which way's up.

674
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,200
I don't think the guy's got a clue.

675
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,660
You mean to say that he is a man...

676
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:08,831
- Yeah.
- who couldn't make up his...

677
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:13,418
- mind.
- Mind. Exactly.

678
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,586
- Very good.
- All right.

679
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,505
- B.
- Yeah.

680
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,639
- Ms. Coleman.
- Yes, Mr. Bates?

681
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,138
What are the central conflicts
in "Hamlet"?

682
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,731
Political, of course, because Claudius
usurped his father's throne.

683
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,566
Oedipal, because of the undercurrents
with his mother.

684
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,441
And then, there's the timeless
question of insanity.

685
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,486
Is he really seeing his father's ghost,
or is he simply mad?

686
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:45,700
That is seriously... overreaching.

687
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,449
- F.
- F?

688
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,995
F.
Mr. Frenelli. Who is Fortinbras?

689
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,547
So, I started reading
your new book and,

690
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,717
it just makes me feel really depressed.

691
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,634
And how do you feel about that?

692
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,891
Depressed.

693
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,610
And how do you feel about that?

694
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,743
She and her best friend
aren't speaking, Doctor.

695
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:32,710
In her diary,
she keeps mentioning this boy.

696
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,536
And how do you feel about that?

697
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,122
- Well, I'm worried.
- You read her diaries?

698
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,340
That's gross.

699
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,801
That's bad. Bad Mom award.

700
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,723
But I'm concerned that she
and this boy might be...

701
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,800
I mean, you know...

702
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,884
Stop!

703
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,854
Stop! Nothing is going on
between her and this guy.

704
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:56,271
If there was, she wouldn't be writing
about it, she'd be out there doing it.

705
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,820
Her best friend probably isn't talking
to her because she likes this guy too.

706
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:05,071
He probably even flirted with her.
But he secretly likes your daughter.

707
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,406
He hasn't made his move yet
because that wouldn't be cool,

708
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,372
so now her friend is acting
like some psycho freak.

709
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,536
OK?

710
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,621
That's very interesting. I never
would have thought about it that way.

711
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,088
Cool, guess we're done.

712
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,382
- Hey, hold up.
- All right.

713
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,974
Mr. Bates, may I please speak with you?

714
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,350
I think that'd be fairly pointless,
but go ahead.

715
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:37,015
By what stretch of the imagination...

716
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,942
I mean, like, how could I get an F?
What mistakes did I make?

717
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,692
- Grading is subjective.
- That was a college-level analysis.

718
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,783
You're qualified
to make that assessment?

719
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,362
As a matter of fact,
I most certainly am.

720
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,457
Well, in the words of Hamlet,
"What's done is done."

721
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,707
<i>That's Macbeth,
you know-nothing twi...</i>

722
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,672
Bates! Elton Bates!

723
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,884
- Griffith High School.
- How do you know that?

724
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,548
You asked me, I mean my mom,
to the prom, but she turned you down.

725
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,934
- This is not an appropriate...
- Now you're taking it out on her daughter.

726
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,603
- Aren't you?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

727
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:19,395
It was a high school dance.
You've got to let it go and move on, man.

728
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,398
If you don't, I'm sure the school board

729
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,817
would love to hear
about your pathetic vendetta

730
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,318
against an innocent student.

731
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,402
By the way, Elton,

732
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,871
she had a boyfriend and you were weird.

733
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,877
That was amazing!
You totally destroyed him.

734
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:42,248
I don't think Elton Bates
will be giving me trouble anymore.

735
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,628
- So weird about your mom.
- What did she say?

736
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,501
- About what?
- About the audition.

737
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,594
Oh, right, she said no.

738
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,047
What?

739
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,849
Well, it is her rehearsal dinner.

740
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,677
Don't you think
that's rather important, too?

741
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,522
And you told her this chance
would like, never come again?

742
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,350
She sympathizes, but...

743
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:04,023
Don't give us this, Anna.
She's totally ruining our lives.

744
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,941
You are the culprit.

745
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,773
Your mom has never cared
about our music.

746
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:12,695
Never cared? Who do you think
paid for all of those guitar lessons?

747
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,371
Did she ever hear a thank you?
No, I don't think so.

748
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,081
Anna, you said it yourself.

749
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:21,294
Your mom hasn't paid any attention to
you since she started dating that guy.

750
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,164
- That's not true.
- You talk about it enough.

751
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,296
- I do?
- What is up with you today?

752
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:30,421
You act like you don't care
about this band.

753
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:34,641
Look, girls... guys. If it were
any other night but tonight...

754
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:35,683
Whatever, Anna.

755
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,523
God.

756
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,246
- You picked up my car?
- Yeah.

757
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,206
Get out of the car, I'm driving.

758
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,717
Oh, my God.
What have you done to me?

759
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,594
- Do you like it?
- Get out of the car right now!

760
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,182
- Do you have your permit?
- No.

761
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:25,601
My hair. It's gone. And what is this?
What have you done to my ear?

762
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,402
- Mom, it's an earring.
- Take it out right now.

763
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,856
- No, it looks cool.
- Don't start with me.

764
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,320
Those clothes are going back
first thing tomorrow.

765
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,284
Why? Everyone likes them.
You look great.

766
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,204
- I look like Stevie Nicks.
- Who's he?

767
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,121
- What are you doing with this?
- I'm eating.

768
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,043
- You cannot eat fast food.
- Why not?

769
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,835
Because it will go down your throat
and drop instantly to my thighs.

770
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,466
- Come on...
- Watch the road.

771
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:55,805
Oh, this food will make you
blow up like a balloon,

772
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,304
but it will do nothing whatsoever to me.

773
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,885
Aw, Mom!

774
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,565
- Oh, God, this is good.
- Mom, that's not fair.

775
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,439
My first French fry in eight years.

776
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,154
I can hear the Hallelujah Chorus.

777
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,945
Road!

778
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,079
Hi! You back so soon.

779
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,412
Hey, sexy new look for you,
Mrs. Coleman. You look hot.

780
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,254
- Two for lunch?
- No, Pei-Pei.

781
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,791
We'd like to speak to you about
something we think happened to us,

782
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,875
at your restaurant.

783
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,256
- Something that sucks!
- Shh, let me handle this.

784
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,382
OK.

785
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:39,721
When we woke up this morning,
we weren't... ourselves.

786
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,138
Yeah.

787
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,932
Oh. Mama!

788
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,445
Ay, ay, ay!
You come back here!

789
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:59,285
- Hello. Hello.
- Did you give them the fortune cookie?

790
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,796
- What did she say?
- Oh, she's crazy.

791
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,809
- Jeez!
- Well?

792
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,268
She don't know what
you're talking about. No idea.

793
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,441
OK, let's have lunch.
OK, let's eat.

794
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,897
- You know what we're talking about.
- Let's hit her.

795
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,897
OK, OK, OK.

796
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,276
Uh...

797
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,276
I cannot fix it. Only you can fix it.

798
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,869
When the fortune come true,
then you go back. Not before.

799
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,453
- What fortune?
- From the fortune cookie.

800
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,875
You find the answer in each other.

801
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,080
When the fortune come true,
then you go back, OK?

802
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,709
No big deal.

803
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,834
You mean we're like,
stuck in this suck-fest?

804
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:59,638
- You're not going to do anything?
- How about 10% off catering?

805
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,090
No, Pei-Pei, I already told you,
we have a caterer.

806
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:06,394
Uh... actually, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

807
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,474
OK, good idea!
How about I do?

808
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,861
- What did that fortune say?
- Like, I remember?

809
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,564
- I don't remember either.
- I hate this!

810
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,865
I don't want to get married at 15!
It's not even legal.

811
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,495
I want my room back.
I want my friends.

812
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,115
I want to eat whatever I want
when I want.

813
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,961
- Mommy.
- I know, sweetie. It's a hard day.

814
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,504
It's OK, we'll get through it.
Sweetie, breathe.

815
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,090
Deep breath.
We'll go home and find the fortune.

816
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,377
Oh!

817
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,966
- My organizer.
- Make it stop.

818
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,389
It's been going off all day.

819
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,102
Parent-teacher conference!
I completely forgot.

820
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,347
You have to be at Harry's school
in 15 minutes.

821
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,725
- No! I hate teachers.
- You have to go. I'll go to your school,

822
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,903
and take your qualifying exam,
and everything will be OK. OK?

823
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,155
- OK, let's go.
- Yeah, but...

824
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,488
Mom?

825
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,244
Yeah, whatever.

826
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,035
Mrs. Coleman.

827
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,418
All right, let's do this thing.

828
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,174
OK. Well...

829
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,753
What can I say about Harry?
He... he is a sweet boy.

830
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:26,050
But he's having
a little trouble with bullies.

831
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,686
So? That's character-building.

832
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,097
Kid needs to toughen up.
He's kind of a wimp.

833
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:37,486
- So, that's it? I can go?
- No, not exactly. Uh...

834
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:42,236
Harry's very bright, but he's having
a problem applying himself,

835
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,776
- particularly in math.
- So, hold him back.

836
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,738
He's short.
He'll fit in, know what I mean?

837
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,959
Um... Well, you know,
he's very good in English.

838
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:56,212
I had the class write an essay
on who they admire most,

839
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,459
and he wrote a wonderful paper
about your daughter.

840
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,530
So, what'd she say?

841
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,158
She showed me the paper
you wrote about Anna.

842
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,026
- You saw that?
- Mm-hm.

843
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,280
- Don't tell her I like her.
- Why not?

844
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,749
Because we have too much fun fighting.

845
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:42,126
You know kid, you are way more twisted
than I thought.

846
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,924
- Good try! Loser!
- Oh, man!

847
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,935
Good luck flunking.

848
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,894
Stacey, I want to talk to you.
Come here.

849
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:02,021
Why this falling out?
We were best friends in sixth grade.

850
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,237
I know I got involved with my music
and you with your cheerleading.

851
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,735
But why does this have to be
World War III?

852
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,614
All those years of trick-or-treating
and sleep-overs.

853
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,037
Don't you remember any of it?
I know I do.

854
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,124
I mean, how do you feel about that?

855
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,172
All right, let's all take our seats
for the test.

856
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,050
Sit with me?

857
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,130
Communication. That's all it takes.

858
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,467
Hey! There you are.

859
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,769
- You again.
- Look at you.

860
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:38,182
Love the hair.

861
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,858
Got a surprise for you.
You're gonna be happy with me.

862
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,437
- I seriously doubt that.
- Great dress. Sexy.

863
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,898
- Oozing sore!
- I don't see anything.

864
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,994
- Make-up. Great stuff.
- Take it easy, stud.

865
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,447
- Save it for the honeymoon.
- You know what? We have to go anyway.

866
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,750
- No, I have to get that fortune thingy.
- No.

867
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,834
- No time, I've got my sweater on.
- No, I just have to go up...

868
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,797
We have to leave now.
We'll spoil the surprise.

869
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,967
- Watch your step.
- OK, OK.

870
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,462
- Still got your eyes closed?
- Yeah.

871
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,724
All right, relax. Open 'em.

872
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,470
You're on "The Dottie Robertson Show".
They had a last-second cancellation.

873
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,973
You're on. I got you on
The Dottie Robertson Show.

874
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,394
To talk about that book?

875
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,527
- Break a leg, honey!
- I didn't want to say anything because...

876
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,899
We're ready for you now, Dr. Coleman.

877
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,696
I know you get nervous,
but you're gonna be great.

878
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:28,781
- I'm gonna barf!
- Gonna be great.

879
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,904
- This way.
- Go get 'em.

880
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,323
Watch your step.

881
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,909
- Right this way and...
- I'm really not...

882
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,036
and right there.
There you go. Sorry.

883
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,037
It's OK.

884
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,244
Make-up's gonna come to you, sweetie.

885
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,457
<i>What is this thing?
"Through the Looking Glass."</i>

886
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:49,969
<i>"Senescence"."Senescence"?
"Se-ne-sen-sy..."</i>

887
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,466
What?

888
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,518
<i>The sum of the areas
of the shaded regions in terms of D</i>

889
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,891
<i>is equal to: A: D squared
times the sum of pi</i>

890
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:02,440
<i>divided by four minus D divided by two.</i>

891
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:06,608
<i>B: D squared times the sum of pi cubed
divided by D minus two.</i>

892
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:11,112
<i>What's pi again? 3 point something.
This is ridiculous!</i>

893
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,944
<i>I've never used pi.
Anna's never gonna use pi.</i>

894
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,786
<i>Why is it called pi anyway?</i>

895
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,322
<i>OK, focus.</i>

896
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,825
<i>Or C: D cubed minus the sum of pi
squared minus D two...</i>

897
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,000
Psst!

898
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,675
Miss Brown, she's copying my test.

899
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,077
- Hey, cheater.
- I did not cheat.

900
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,158
That Stacey Hinkhouse
is a conniving little...

901
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,580
Hey, whatever, it's your business.

902
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,959
I did not cheat.
Don't you smirk at me.

903
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,798
If you're so perfect, then why
are you in detention all the time?

904
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,298
I'm not in detention. I work here.

905
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,808
What would you say if I told you
I could help you finish your test?

906
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:23,187
- Really?
- Yeah.

907
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,562
My publisher doesn't think
anybody's gonna know

908
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,355
what the word "senescence" means.

909
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,614
- Do you know what it means?
- No, please to sit still.

910
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,904
All right, they keep the tests
in the file room.

911
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,035
We're going through here?

912
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,663
They're so burned out
they won't even notice. Trust me.

913
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,821
All right. Coleman.

914
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,193
Anna Coleman.

915
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,573
My gosh, thank you.

916
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,450
Now, hurry up and finish your test.

917
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,790
You know, you really are something, Jake.

918
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,745
I'll watch the door.

919
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,499
Loved your book.
I actually read this one.

920
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,635
That makes one of us.

921
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,047
Ready, and...

922
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,299
Three, two...

923
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,432
Hi, and welcome back.
We're here with Dr. Tess Coleman,

924
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:49,766
author of "Through the Looking Glass:
Senescence in Retrograde."

925
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,439
So, Doctor, tell us about your new book.

926
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,407
Well...

927
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,411
I wrote it.

928
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,538
Yes, you did.

929
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,956
But tell us...

930
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:11,789
what got you interested in the
physical and intellectual exhaustion

931
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:16,630
that seems to overcome those of us
who are, let's say, no longer 20?

932
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,553
"Senescence", like "senile". Old people!

933
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,683
Got it, got it.

934
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,684
And, let's face it,
we are tired much of the time.

935
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,981
That's why I've been craving caffeine
all day, I thought I was dying.

936
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,474
But you still haven't answered
the fundamental question.

937
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,182
Why are we so tired?

938
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,355
Well...

939
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,027
Of course we're tired
because of our demanding and hectic...

940
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,530
Do you wanna know why adults
are so tired all the time?

941
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:31,747
Because they spend their time obsessing
about these stupid lame things

942
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:34,295
they don't really have to do.
Like cooking.

943
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,581
I mean, have you never
heard of take-out?

944
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:40,836
And cleaning, let's don't,
and say we did!

945
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,222
And quality time with your kids,

946
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,549
You know what, quit buggin' 'em!

947
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,722
Leave 'em alone. They like it.

948
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,437
<i>I don't remember
reading any of this in your book.</i>

949
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,608
<i>Hello!</i>

950
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,397
<i>It's called reading between the lines.</i>

951
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,732
- Oh, my God.
- What?

952
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,367
That's my mom.

953
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,948
<i>Try listening to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,</i>

954
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,246
<i>The Vines, The Breeders and,</i>

955
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,451
<i>if you're excited about something, why
do you have to hold it in all the time?</i>

956
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,254
<i>You know, just scream about it!
OK, do this with me, all right?</i>

957
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,832
<i>Let's just say this cute guy
asks you out.</i>

958
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:20,791
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

959
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,760
<i>Come on, that was pathetic!</i>

960
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,060
<i>You keep all that bottled up,
no wonder you're getting old.</i>

961
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:34,230
<i>I'm serious. This guy's hot.
What are you gonna do?</i>

962
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,314
<i>God, your mom's cool.</i>

963
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,728
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

964
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,777
Oh, she is dead, worse than dead.

965
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:47,778
She will spend the next year in
a phoneless, dateless, Amish existence.

966
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,704
I've got to get home.
Gotta get home!

967
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:57,412
<i>I never knew girls existed like you</i>

968
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:02,421
<i>She is beautiful, she is beautiful</i>

969
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,344
<i>The girl is beautiful</i>

970
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,011
Listen, I need you to give me a ride.

971
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,763
I thought your mom
didn't want you on a bike.

972
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,145
You know,
you're a little too virtuous, kid.

973
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,014
You know what?
I'm late for my second job.

974
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,145
Just give me the ride.

975
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,774
I know for a fact
my mother will understand.

976
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,771
You know what, I'm just gonna
be very honest with you.

977
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,698
You seem really different
than the person I thought you were.

978
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,284
I saw what you did to Stacey's test.

979
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,868
I think you're right.
You're too young for me.

980
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,496
But I don't even know why I did that.

981
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,040
- It's really not like me, honestly.
- Good luck, Anna.

982
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,299
Come on, they'll let her
retake the test.

983
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,420
That's the first time Tessie's work
hasn't put me to sleep.

984
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,714
I might even read one of those books.

985
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,593
Hey. Excuse me. Is Dr. Coleman
coming out soon?

986
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,221
Dottie had her escorted
from the building 10 minutes ago, sir.

987
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,314
But she rocks, doesn't she?

988
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,525
Look, she signed my butt.

989
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,903
- Yes!
- Whoo!

990
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:14,705
Can I have a quad shot caramel latte?

991
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,001
Mrs. Coleman?

992
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,914
Jake... What are you doing here?

993
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,624
I work here.

994
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:29,090
Hey, I caught the show.
You were... great.

995
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:32,090
Thanks. How was Anna today?

996
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,391
I mean, was she nice to you?

997
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:39,188
She was stressing a little,
but you know how it is with school.

998
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,563
OK, cause if she wasn't,
I'd have to punish her.

999
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,648
You punish her?

1000
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,363
No mom that listens to The Vines
would punish anybody.

1001
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,987
- You like The Vines?
- I got the bootlegs.

1002
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,535
Shut up!

1003
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,657
Oh, Anna-banana, it's you!

1004
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,826
- Where's Mom?
- She ditched us at the studio.

1005
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:04,293
Harry, get down
from the table this instant!

1006
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,840
I'm imitating Mom.
You should've seen her today.

1007
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,755
She was so cool.

1008
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:19,853
- Ramones.
- Love.

1009
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:25,063
- Uh... White Stripes.
- Can't stand 'em.

1010
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,983
I know, me neither.
I mean, get a bass player.

1011
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:34,660
I love this song. Am I so lame
that I would love "Baby, One More Time"?

1012
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,494
<i>- Not this cover, it's a classic.
- Still believe</i>

1013
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,167
<i>When I'm not with you
I lose my mind</i>

1014
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:46,164
<i>Give me a sign</i>

1015
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,379
<i>Hit me, baby, one more time</i>

1016
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,056
<i>How was I supposed to know?</i>

1017
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:04,191
<i>Oh, pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go</i>

1018
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:09,270
- I gotta go.
- What? Don't go.

1019
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:12,448
No, I-I have a wedding rehearsal.

1020
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,483
- Okay, whose?
- Mine.

1021
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,489
- Are you serious?
- I wish I wasn't.

1022
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:25,085
Hey. Look, you're not really
getting married, are you?

1023
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:29,006
Please, listen, this was so fun
and I'm gonna remember it forever...

1024
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,750
- But you can't just...
- Jake.

1025
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,668
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

1026
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,719
I don't know what
this whole thing is...

1027
01:05:34,848 --> 01:05:37,761
I just... I feel like I know you.

1028
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,932
- I have to go. Really, I just...
- Please.

1029
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,857
Just please, let me at least
give you a ride.

1030
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,227
OK.

1031
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,922
There you are, you little monster.

1032
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,554
OK.

1033
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,022
<i>I see trees of green</i>

1034
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,771
<i>Red roses too</i>

1035
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,525
<i>- I see them bloom
- Tess?</i>

1036
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,781
<i>- For me and you
- Tess!</i>

1037
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,205
<i>And I say to myself
- Tess!</i>

1038
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:49,082
<i>What a wonderful world</i>

1039
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,925
Where have you been? You needed
to be dressed a half hour ago.

1040
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,227
- No we're not.
- Tell me where you've been, young lady!

1041
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,471
"Young lady"?

1042
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,062
Uh...

1043
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:12,685
Role playing. Her idea.
A new therapeutic technique.

1044
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,436
Switching points of view.

1045
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,611
If I switch with Harry,
do I have to wear a thong?

1046
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,734
Earthquake! Save me!

1047
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,036
Get back here, you little...

1048
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,280
Anna, where do I even begin?

1049
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,787
Could it be your career-killing
TV appearance?

1050
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,493
Your non-stop partying
with my car and wallet?

1051
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,079
Or, perhaps,
my body's makeover from hell?

1052
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,374
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

1053
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:39,420
- Yes.
- And get that cheap stud out of my ear.

1054
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,551
Mom, he is so awesome.

1055
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,675
- Who?
- Jake.

1056
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,306
Oh, please, Mommy,
can I go out with him? Please?

1057
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,850
Not in Ryan's fiancée's body, you can't.

1058
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,811
What am I supposed to do
in Ryan's fiancée's body?

1059
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,983
Go to this thing tonight, be you?

1060
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,437
OK, that's today.
What about tomorrow, Mom?

1061
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,147
I really, really, really don't want
to get married.

1062
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,360
I don't think you're all that thrilled
about me getting married either, Anna.

1063
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,038
Why?

1064
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,791
Why can't we talk about this?

1065
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,913
What is it about Ryan
that you don't like?

1066
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,328
He's fine.

1067
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,130
But he's not your father.

1068
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:18,459
Mom, I really don't want
to talk about this right now.

1069
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:21,671
Time's running out to talk
about it, honey. Please tell me.

1070
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,389
Mom, do what you want.

1071
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,093
Marry the dude,
just don't make me do it, OK?

1072
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,518
Tess!

1073
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,355
Privacy's a privilege, Anna.

1074
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,142
- Tess!
- Go!

1075
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,651
Yo, what's up?

1076
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:41,532
You know what?
I'm not really a prying kind of guy.

1077
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,031
But just for the heck of it,
I was wondering what you were doing

1078
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,494
on the eve of our wedding

1079
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,956
straddling some guy
on the back of a big, black Harley.

1080
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,284
Hello, it was a Ducati.

1081
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:53,786
Tess, is there something
you'd like to tell me?

1082
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,039
Some fantasy you're trying to get out
of your system?

1083
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,169
Because I'd like to know about it now.

1084
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,669
I just needed a ride.

1085
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,387
I... I didn't really even know the guy.

1086
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,674
I... I didn't know what...

1087
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,517
He's a friend of mine, Ryan.

1088
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:15,062
He likes me and my mom
wouldn't let me go out with him,

1089
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:19,065
so I just had to beg her
to check him out for me.

1090
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:21,856
And she did.

1091
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:26,861
And, she actually came to find
that he's a very together young man.

1092
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,784
And she approves.

1093
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,455
- Really?
- Really.

1094
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,457
Snap!

1095
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:43,256
- Uh-huh.
- So, let's do this thingy.

1096
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,718
- You mean our wedding rehearsal?
- Yeah, whatever.

1097
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,645
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

1098
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:02,112
<i>Cause I need to know now,
oh, because</i>

1099
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,033
<i>My loneliness is killing me</i>

1100
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:12,241
<i>And I, I must confess
I still believe</i>

1101
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:13,582
<i>Still believe</i>

1102
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:14,707
Excuse me.

1103
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:19,417
<i>When I'm not with you
I lose my mind</i>

1104
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,589
<i>Give me a sign</i>

1105
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,340
<i>Hit me ba...</i>

1106
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,757
- What are you doing?
- Shotgun!

1107
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,093
- I wanna talk to your mom.
- Are you insane?

1108
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,519
- I know I am.
- What are you thinking?

1109
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,890
How can you entertain ideas
about you and a woman her age?

1110
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,601
What are you talking about?
She looks great.

1111
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,652
Really? Wow.

1112
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,897
No! You have to disappear.

1113
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,357
I know it's unconventional.

1114
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:50,536
I know nothing can happen.
I'm not stupid, I just...

1115
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:53,159
I wanna know her.
I wanna be able to talk to her.

1116
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,037
Do not come near my mother
or her fiancé, do you understand?

1117
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,663
Man, I don't understand anything.

1118
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,792
For God's sake, Jake, you really need
to find someone your own age.

1119
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:08,592
Anna, you're beautiful,
but you're... not her.

1120
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,264
Stop it! Promise you'll leave
my mother alone.

1121
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,886
Anna-banana!

1122
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,983
I'll give you one thing,
he definitely likes you for your mind.

1123
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,877
Come on!

1124
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,758
All right, let's do this.

1125
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,512
- There we go.
- I'll have what...

1126
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,981
- What you doing?
- Nothing. Did you bring it?

1127
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:02,399
Here. Can you get away?

1128
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:05,895
I'd love to, it's just I'm meeting
thousands of 100-year-old people.

1129
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:09,816
- Those are Ryan's parents. Hi.
- It doesn't make them any less old.

1130
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:13,695
Ryan, do you think I could borrow
my mother for just one minute?

1131
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:15,995
Sure.

1132
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:24,292
OK, there's got to be some clue here.

1133
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:31,341
"A journey soon begins, its prize
reflected in another's eyes..."

1134
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,888
- OK, that was the switch.
- Let me see.

1135
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,015
OK, blah, blah, blah...

1136
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,220
"lack, then selfless love
will change you back."

1137
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,521
Great, that means we're stuck
like this forever.

1138
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,938
Now is not a moment for your negativity.
Let's try to be selfless.

1139
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,939
Give me your hands.

1140
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,026
OK, I'm being selfless.
Are you being selfless?

1141
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,368
Yeah, I'm being selfless.

1142
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,741
You're not doing a very good job
of it because we're still here.

1143
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:01,450
Oh right. So now it's my fault.
Why is everything always...

1144
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,877
It's Jake.

1145
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:08,290
He must've followed us.
Mom, what are we gonna do?

1146
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,593
Mom? Mom!

1147
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,596
Shh. Don't scream.

1148
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:15,798
Just listen to us.

1149
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,595
We're half a block away from
the House of Blues.

1150
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,473
Just tell 'em you're going
to the bathroom, come do the song,

1151
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,312
you'll be back before they know
you've gone.

1152
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,856
- I can't.
- I tried to learn your solo and I suck.

1153
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,192
- Yeah.
- Two bands have gone, and they blew.

1154
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,107
We might have a chance
if you come with us.

1155
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,026
No. When I say I can't,
you don't know the half of it.

1156
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,820
Anna, don't make me do this.

1157
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:49,624
What are you doing? If Ryan
sees you here, it'll blow everything.

1158
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:52,255
I know, I'm sorry.
It's just...

1159
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,419
- When I look into your eyes...
- Stop it!

1160
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:58,307
Jake, believe me, it is not me
you like, it's Anna.

1161
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,430
No, you're the exciting one.
The musical one.

1162
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,352
Actually, I learned it all from her.

1163
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,930
I'm tone deaf.

1164
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,184
- Tess?
- Shh. Don't move!

1165
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,143
Found it!

1166
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,398
- Found what?
- My earring.

1167
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,902
I found it, I thought I lost it.

1168
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,698
Anna's friends decided to crash.

1169
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:19,619
You guys?

1170
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,451
Know anything about this?

1171
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:25,492
Well, I think they're trying to get Anna

1172
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,578
to go to an audition
at the House of Blues,

1173
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,423
which had to be tonight. But I said no,
she had to stay here.

1174
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,050
- You're kidding?
- No, that's how it went down.

1175
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,971
I know it's not important and she's
just a girl in a stupid rock band...

1176
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:41,433
Dr. Coleman, dude, I'm really sorry,

1177
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,932
but couldn't we just borrow Anna
for like, 20 minutes?

1178
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:47,640
We'd never ask you or like,
anybody for anything ever again.

1179
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,190
I am appalled at you two.

1180
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,152
- I clearly said...
- Go.

1181
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:54,230
- What?
- Go.

1182
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,899
- Ryan...
- What are you still doing here?

1183
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,035
- Go, right now.
- Thank you so much.

1184
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,989
I told you he wouldn't
totally ruin your life. Thank you!

1185
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:06,075
Mr. Dude, you rock!

1186
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,372
Thanks, guys.

1187
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:16,718
- Are you mad?
- No.

1188
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,639
Do you, like, not want
to get married now?

1189
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:24,683
No.

1190
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,684
No, I don't, not if you're going
to put me in this role.

1191
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,813
- What role?
- The role of insensitive stepfather

1192
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,520
who couldn't care less,
or thinks it's a stupid rock band,

1193
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:39,198
or any of the preposterous
things you just said.

1194
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,777
How can you say I don't care?
I'm not that guy, Tess.

1195
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,080
And, if that's who you think I am,
this is never gonna work.

1196
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:47,283
When I fell in love with you,
I knew you came with a history,

1197
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,831
and a family and I respect
the hell out of that.

1198
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,625
You've always put the kids first.
That's exactly how it should be.

1199
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,589
That's how I want it.

1200
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:59,336
I never pushed Anna because I want her
to like me on her own terms,

1201
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,513
in her own way.

1202
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,848
Wow.

1203
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,595
- That's very cool.
- Yeah.

1204
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,440
- Now, what are you still doing here?
- What do you mean?

1205
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:16,482
You should be over there.
That's where you want to be.

1206
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,564
Cheering her on,
that's where I want you to be.

1207
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,315
- But...
- Go on!

1208
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:23,785
Go. I can hold down the fort
here for 20 minutes.

1209
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,913
Wish her luck for me.

1210
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,575
OK.

1211
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,846
- Hold it.
- You're not serious, no.

1212
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,017
OK, great.

1213
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:51,222
I've got ID for once. Thanks.

1214
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:57,645
<i>Well, you're all dressed up
And then you had some place to go</i>

1215
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:00,446
<i>Yeah, you waited so long</i>

1216
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,445
So, it's a good crowd out there.

1217
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:06,115
Anna, what are you doing?
What's wrong?

1218
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,663
- I can't do this.
- Since when do you get nervous?

1219
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,660
- No, I really, really can't.
- You rock harder than anyone I know.

1220
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,913
The rocking may be
in short supply tonight, girls.

1221
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:19,215
- What do you mean?
- I'm just not myself.

1222
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,544
Anna, look, I know you're stressing.
OK, we all are.

1223
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,301
And I know that maybe
it won't be brilliant.

1224
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:28,384
But we'll forgive each other. We'll find
some way to laugh about it later.

1225
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:31,645
Right now, I just really want us
to take this shot, OK?

1226
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,186
- We'll still love you, even if it blows.
- Yeah.

1227
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,235
OK, I'll try.
I mean, how hard can it be?

1228
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:42,610
Don't forget, we changed
the chord progression in the first verse

1229
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,443
from CCD to CDC.

1230
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,326
You play notes?

1231
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,074
I mean, I just thought we could play
in the key of rock.

1232
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:57,621
- Yeah. OK, let's fix your hair.
- Yeah, what's with the bun?

1233
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,007
- Mrs. Coleman!
- Jake! Stop!

1234
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,678
Look, I knew it,
you're running away from him!

1235
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:09,766
Jake, if you like me at all,
you will just leave me alone.

1236
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,969
- Yeah, but...
- Please, no.

1237
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,228
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

1238
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:20,652
the next act in the KISS FM
Wango Tango auditions

1239
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:25,073
from right here in Los Angeles,
let's give it up for Pink Slip.

1240
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,252
<i>Yeah</i>

1241
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:41,006
<i>Yeah</i>

1242
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:46,761
<i>Get up, get out
Move on, move on, there's no doubt</i>

1243
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,050
Do something!

1244
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,008
<i>...you're right
It's all the same to you</i>

1245
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:54,849
<i>I'm too thin, too fat
You ask why, so why</i>

1246
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:57,773
<i>So why, so why, so why</i>

1247
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,438
<i>On and on and on</i>

1248
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:06,527
<i>On and on and on</i>

1249
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:10,486
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

1250
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:14,327
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

1251
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:20,128
<i>I wanna shout out
Take me away, away, away</i>

1252
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:26,461
<i>Away, away-ay-ay</i>

1253
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:30,840
<i>Round and round
Here we go again</i>

1254
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:34,426
<i>Same old start
Same old end</i>

1255
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,015
<i>Turn my head I turn back again
Same old...</i>

1256
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,433
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this. It was horrifying.

1257
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,315
It's OK, I unplugged you.
Just go back out there and fake it.

1258
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:45,646
No, I don't even know how to do that.

1259
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:48,482
Come on, Mom, you can't tell me
you never went to a rock concert.

1260
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,734
OK, I saw the Stones once.

1261
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:53,662
OK, great! Just go out there
and act like Keith.

1262
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:55,238
Keith, right, yeah.

1263
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,119
- Richards, Mom!
- I knew that.

1264
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,039
- Just go act like Keith!
- Act like Keith.

1265
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,833
- Not the behavior.
- No, just the playing.

1266
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,878
Now get out there,
your solo's coming!

1267
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:09,928
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

1268
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:13,674
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

1269
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:19,601
<i>I wanna shout out
Take me away, away, away</i>

1270
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:25,812
<i>Away, away-ay-ay</i>

1271
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:52,178
<i>Don't wanna grow up
I wanna get out</i>

1272
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,803
<i>Hey, take me away</i>

1273
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,555
<i>I wanna shout out</i>

1274
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:02,264
<i>Take me away, away, away</i>

1275
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:08,733
<i>- Away, away-ay-ay
- JAKE: Whoo! Anna, you rock!</i>

1276
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:12,532
<i>Round and round
Here we go again</i>

1277
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:16,202
<i>Same old story
Same old end</i>

1278
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,032
<i>Turn my head
I turn back again</i>

1279
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:24,377
<i>Same old stuff
Never ends</i>

1280
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,105
It's a little early, but I think
you guys are definitely in.

1281
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,020
All right!

1282
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,817
- Are we in?
- Yes!

1283
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:52,026
It was terrifying.
I had no idea what it takes.

1284
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:53,652
- The guts.
- Thanks.

1285
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,028
It's exciting, your music.

1286
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,612
- It's not noise?
- Most definitely not noise.

1287
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:03,245
Oh, my God. Ryan! Come on.

1288
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,254
Anna?

1289
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:19,716
- My first wedding went like this.
- Like what?

1290
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,846
She ran away with the florist,
whole thing went right down the tubes.

1291
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,564
- Don't make me hurt you.
- Hmm.

1292
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,020
There she is.

1293
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,581
Mom, what's wrong?

1294
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:50,129
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

1295
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:53,250
Sure, Mom. After what
you just did for me, anything.

1296
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,885
It needs to happen now
before all the toasts and speeches.

1297
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:56,878
OK.

1298
01:22:57,431 --> 01:23:00,094
Clearly we're not
switching back tonight.

1299
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:03,222
I need you to tell Ryan that you need
to postpone the wedding.

1300
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,474
- What?
- No, listen...

1301
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:09,516
I can see you're not ready for this.
And I can wait.

1302
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:13,775
I was just so happy I wasn't thinking
about what's best for you and Harry.

1303
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:18,275
- But, Mom...
- If he loves me like I think he does,

1304
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:22,411
he'll wait, too. He'll understand.

1305
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,906
He'll be very sweet
and gracious about it.

1306
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:30,959
But please, just please
let him know that I love him.

1307
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,376
And be as kind as you possibly can.

1308
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,049
For me.

1309
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,965
OK, Mom.

1310
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,675
- I know exactly what to say.
- I'll be along in a minute.

1311
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:57,814
Um... You should sit down.

1312
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:12,749
Uh, hi.

1313
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:14,748
Um...

1314
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,006
I guess I'm gonna start the toasts.

1315
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:25,308
So, three years ago we had
a really bad thing happen in our family.

1316
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:28,849
We lost a father and a husband.

1317
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,898
I didn't think we'd ever
be able to get over it.

1318
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:38,318
But then... this guy next to me,

1319
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:41,399
came into the picture.

1320
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,619
And everybody could see
I was happy again.

1321
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:50,833
I was singing in the shower again.
Not well, I might add.

1322
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:58,504
But I was still really worried
about my kids, Anna and Harry.

1323
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:05,682
Whether they'd be able to...
accept a new man in their life.

1324
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:09,807
And, now I know how Anna feels.

1325
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,813
And what she feels is that...

1326
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:22,152
No one could ever
take the place of her dad...

1327
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:27,324
because he was a really great dad.

1328
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:34,377
But somebody could, um,
be part of a new family.

1329
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:40,542
Its own kind of cool, new, little unit.

1330
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:48,641
That for someone as special as Ryan
we would all just make a little room.

1331
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:54,355
Anna really wanted her mom
to know that.

1332
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,283
Earthquake!

1333
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:29,802
Yeah!

1334
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:34,888
And I am so psyched to be here.

1335
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:41,065
I guess all I'm trying to say is,
Ryan, welcome to our family.

1336
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,486
To the bride and groom.

1337
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:49,486
- What the hell just happened?
- Trust me, you don't want to know.

1338
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,226
Thank you for everything.

1339
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:26,656
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1340
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:31,653
What?

1341
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,867
Go. Go!

1342
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:43,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

1343
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:50,213
Listen, I... feel really stupid.

1344
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:55,385
You know, I... Yesterday was freaky.

1345
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:59,189
And, I mean, I see your mom
and I like her.

1346
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,983
I mean, not "like her" like her,

1347
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,942
but, you know I mean,
I like her as your mom.

1348
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,694
Listen, do you think we could just...

1349
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,737
rewind this whole thing and start again?

1350
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,661
I'd like that.

1351
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:21,745
<i>So all your words get noticed</i>

1352
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:27,167
You know, I've been thinking
about that kiss.

1353
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,343
Kiss?

1354
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,385
Remind me again how I did it.

1355
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:36,684
In front of your mom?

1356
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,061
It's OK, she owes me.

1357
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:43,808
<i>Oh-oh-oh-oh</i>

1358
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:50,319
<i>And I-I-I</i>

1359
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:53,947
<i>I think I'll change my ways</i>

1360
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:08,667
<i>Tomorrow's a brand new day</i>

1361
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,183
Hey, why don't you ask
that girl to dance?

1362
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,557
- No way.
- Come on, go on over there.

1363
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,187
Stop bugging me.

1364
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:25,058
Boy, it's true.
Youth is wasted on the young.

1365
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,776
You go ask her then, you old fart!

1366
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,145
Now, wait a minute.

1367
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,731
- If I was your age...
- Cookie?

1368
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:35,739
Well, I... Yes, I don't mind if I do.

1369
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:39,451
Mama! What are you doing?

1370
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:40,827
Mama!

1371
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:44,206
Grandpa, Harry! No!

1372
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:49,881
OK.

1373
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:10,023
<i>You're the kind of friend
Who always bends when I'm broken</i>

1374
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:16,693
<i>Like remember when you took my heart
And put it back together again</i>

1375
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:21,073
<i>I've been wasting time
With clueless guys</i>

1376
01:30:21,207 --> 01:30:25,542
<i>But now it's over
Let me tell you why I'm through</i>

1377
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,915
<i>I've met someone new
Who's just like you</i>

1378
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,876
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

1379
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,882
<i>It's automatic
I'm sure of it</i>

1380
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:38,882
<i>No lie
So don't even try</i>

1381
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:42,476
<i>To tell me that you're not the guy</i>

1382
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:45,350
<i>Cause I been waitin' all my life</i>

1383
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:47,849
<i>For someone just like you</i>

1384
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,144
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

1385
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:52,694
<i>You</i>

1386
01:30:57,744 --> 01:31:00,077
<i>You're the kind of guy
Whose hand's in mine</i>

1387
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:03,198
<i>Sends shivers up and down my spine</i>

1388
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,118
<i>I want to do to you
What you do to me</i>

1389
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:11,831
<i>You're the kind of guy
That blows my mind</i>

1390
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:13,465
<i>And now it's my turn</i>

1391
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:17,132
<i>You've been right in front of me</i>

1392
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:21,223
<i>Everything I need
Why didn't I see?</i>

1393
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:24,431
<i>You're it
You're the ultimate</i>

1394
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:27,480
<i>It's automatic
I'm sure of it</i>

1395
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:30,433
<i>No lie
So don't even try</i>

1396
01:31:30,986 --> 01:31:33,273
<i>To tell me that you're not the guy</i>

1397
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,565
<i>Cause I been waiting all my life</i>

<i>You're it
You're the ultimate you</i>

<i>You're it
You're the ultimate you</i>

1408
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:55,397
<i>Imagine me and you
I do</i>

1409
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:58,104
<i>I think about you day and night
It's only right</i>

1410
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:00,736
<i>To think about the girl you love
And hold her tight</i>

1411
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,613
<i>So happy together</i>

1412
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:06,283
<i>If I should call you up
Invest a dime</i>

1413
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,910
<i>And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind</i>

1414
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,583
<i>Imagine how the world could be
So very fine</i>

1415
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:14,787
<i>So happy together</i>

1416
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:18,382
<i>I can't see me
Loving nobody but you</i>

01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,551
<i>For all my life</i>

1418
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:23,721
<i>When you're with me, baby
The skies'll be blue</i>

1419
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:25,890
<i>For all my life</i>

<i>Me and you
And you and me</i>

1421
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:31,937
<i>No matter how they toss the dice
It has to be</i>

1422
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:34,561
<i>The only one for me is you
And you for me</i>

1423
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,769
<i>So happy together</i>

1424
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:40,104
