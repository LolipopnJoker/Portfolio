<i>We keep bringing him
sacred food,</i>

3
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,938
<i>and nothing's happening.</i>

00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:35,475
<i>I... The Beast,
he's shown himself twice</i>

00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:39,648
<i>to the masses of the broken,
and-and they're not believing.</i>

00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,050
<i>There's no revolution. I...</i>

7
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,986
<i>Dennis, do not be scared.</i>

8
00:00:44,987 --> 00:00:49,423
<i>You have to trust me,
as you always have.</i>

9
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:26,095
Look at you all.

10
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,997
My name is Patricia.

11
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:35,871
Now, who would like
a PB and J sandwich?

12
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:39,206
You do.

13
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:07,300
Ooh! Boom!

14
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,304
Ooh!

15
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:12,440
Ah, look at.

16
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,508
Oh!

17
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,310
I am the master boy.

18
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:20,549
Superman punch, bitch! Yeah!

19
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:24,752
Hey!

20
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,087
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,057
You all right, brother?

22
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,321
Ooh, you see his bag fall?

23
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:04,025
It's what they call
dramatic effect.

24
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:07,061
This is gonna get
so many views.

25
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,299
That a raccoon again?

26
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,098
Did you leave the door open, T?

27
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,501
I closed it.

28
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,337
Hello?

29
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:21,343
Yo, who's there?

30
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,551
We about to Salt Bae your ass.

31
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:39,530
Superman-punch him, Ronald.

32
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:59,079
Oh, shit.

33
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,017
It's you.

34
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,393
They bumped into me
at the subway.

35
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,528
Can't just let 'em go, Joseph.

36
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,566
Weren't you on
a specified walk?

37
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:53,267
You can't run this
like the store.

38
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,869
It's potluck.

39
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,840
All things come second
when we're on a specified walk.

40
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,374
The store works
'cause we have rules.

41
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,477
Hey, it was a good follow,
though.

42
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,515
"We gonna Salt Bae your ass."
What a douche.

43
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,186
It's definitely going
into the book.

44
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:14,220
"Salt Bae your ass."

45
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,222
What is that, anyway?

46
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,725
It's an Internet guy.

47
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,830
He's a butcher who salts
his meat in an elaborate way.

48
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:24,434
You got dinged.

49
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,669
Good news:
they're not calling you

50
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:31,539
the Tiptoe Man
or the Float anymore.

51
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:35,241
They pretty much settled on
the Overseer.

52
00:05:35,244 --> 00:05:37,244
It's cool.

53
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:40,650
Do not mention
the Tiptoe Man ever again.

54
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,121
That's all he does?
He seasons meat?

55
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,823
Dad, you look tired.

56
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:52,193
Why don't we save the next walk
for the day after tomorrow?

57
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:57,133
When we find this Horde,
I'll take a mental health day.

58
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:00,400
Okay. Fine.

59
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,503
I have a new tenuous theory.

60
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:04,873
Let's call it
Tenuous Theory Number Two.

61
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:07,475
The first set of girls
that were found mutilated

62
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:09,443
at the zoo three weeks ago
happened here.

63
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:10,979
The second set, here.

64
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,547
Now, these new girls
that went missing

65
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,549
create kind of
a messy triangle,

66
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,450
and where you were waiting
today at the subway

67
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,653
was in the middle
of this triangle.

68
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,823
In Tenuous Theory Number Two,
he isn't in this triangle.

69
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:24,592
He's coming from a place
that has easy access

70
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,393
to this triangular
feeding zone.

71
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,395
I think he's
somewhere here, Dad,

72
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:30,631
- in the factory area.
- Okay.

73
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,701
I'll walk around there
tomorrow.

74
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:35,369
Hey, Dad?

75
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,605
I'm checking
the police scanners.

76
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,575
They're looking for you
pretty aggressively.

77
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,309
Be real careful.

78
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:44,212
All right.

79
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:09,871
Philadelphia
has a new tallest building.

80
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:12,840
The Osaka Tower is taking over
the city skyline.

81
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:15,744
The architecture makes it
an amazing sight to see.

82
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,612
And on top of that, it's
the ultimate in sustainability.

83
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,816
It gets its power
from solar panels.

84
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,650
Developers say it will
draw jobs to the city

85
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,722
by the thousands...

86
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:46,576
Audrey, I have to tell you
something.

87
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,945
Audrey.

88
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:17,672
Miss Patricia said
that I'm not allowed

89
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:20,008
to play with you guys,
so don't even ask.

90
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,943
I had a girlfriend once.

91
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:24,879
You don't know her.

92
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,080
We kissed.

93
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,948
It's no big deal.

94
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,717
Stop messing with us.

95
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,919
What do you want?

96
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,553
Vera, don't get him angry.

97
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:35,123
- He's sick.
- Don't tell me names.

98
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:37,358
They said not to ask you
your names,

99
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:42,129
because I might get sad,
you know, after tonight.

100
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,099
Why did you pick us, Hedwig?

101
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,399
Oh, uh, because you're impure

102
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,769
and you haven't done
any suffering.

103
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:55,441
You know that boy band stuff?

104
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,478
It's... some of it's okay,
but Drake?

105
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,848
Drake's my new main man.

106
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:03,884
The Beast is gonna come
for you guys

107
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:07,454
any minute now, and I...

108
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,892
I get... I get to greet him.

109
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:15,629
It's my big reward for keeping
the Horde in the light.

110
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:19,935
I get to take him
to the masses of the broken.

111
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,136
I better go.

112
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,606
He can come at any second

113
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:26,907
and I don't want him coming

114
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:29,878
and finding roller skates
on his feet.

115
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,749
Miss Patricia would find out,
and she'd get angry, et cetera.

116
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,956
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yep, thanks.

117
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,093
- This is an outdoor dome infrared.
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,494
We can use as many as you want
in the apartment building.

119
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:51,032
You use a 16-channel HD DVR
in your security office.

120
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,634
One of the tenants
got murdered off-site,

121
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,570
and people are on edge.

122
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,503
- They just want to feel safe.
- Totally get it.

123
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,074
I'm gonna take a walk.

124
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:02,210
Yeah, I don't think that you
need to take a walk today, Dad.

125
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,178
Maybe tomorrow or the next day.

126
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:06,984
No, I think I'm gonna
take a walk now.

127
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:11,051
Uh, you don't want
to take a lot of walks.

128
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,721
You might get tired.

129
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:16,456
Let your dad take a walk.
Jesus.

130
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:17,860
Yeah.

131
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:20,829
Hey, do I know you?

132
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,498
Did you used to work
at the football stadium?

133
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,634
15 years.

134
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,802
I used to hang out
with some shady types

135
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,805
down at the stadium
in my youth.

136
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,907
Turned it around
with positive thinking.

137
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,846
Should I ring this up?

138
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:40,715
We're gonna have
to close early.

139
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:41,950
Yeah.

140
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:48,249
Peak transit time's over.

141
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,950
I missed him.

142
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:53,489
I'll come back tomorrow
when the factories are let out.

143
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,758
Can come back to the store
and we could do some inventory.

144
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,194
Okay.

145
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,029
I'll see you back at the store.

146
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,272
You guys like cartoons?

147
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,207
So babyish.

148
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,676
I don't.

149
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,210
I like documentaries.

150
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,912
You watch documentaries?

151
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:22,082
I watched a documentary
about, um, space.

152
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:23,951
It's real big.

153
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,922
Sorry, bro.

154
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,662
It's him. I saw a room.

155
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:37,765
It had red clay, piles of it.

156
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,300
It's some kind of factory.

157
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,667
They're all in there.

158
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,170
All right, stand by.

159
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,706
I'll search the area.

160
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,644
Dad, I found a brick factory.

161
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,312
Uh, it's old, abandoned.

162
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:54,884
- Which direction?
- To the south.

163
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,788
Dad?

164
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,624
Dad?

165
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:17,104
You said I could have some.

166
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,040
I know.

167
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,643
Taking everything for yourself.

168
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:22,878
Take some.

169
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:29,952
Hey. I...

170
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:35,389
Oh, my God.

171
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:38,125
You said I could have some.

172
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,062
I know.

173
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,003
What?

174
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,008
Huh?

175
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:56,178
Taking everything for yourself.

176
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:00,080
I don't... know...

177
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,735
Who are you?

178
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,904
I...

179
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,710
am you.

180
00:15:12,022 --> 00:15:13,255
Come on!

181
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:19,963
Come on!

182
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,759
Where did it go?

183
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:47,481
Leave!

184
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:42,362
Don't, don't. Don't shoot!

185
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:46,032
We can work through this.

186
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,735
Just put the guns away. I...

187
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,471
What's happening?

188
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,039
I didn't do anything.

189
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,675
My name is Barry.

190
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:55,176
All right?

191
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,245
We have to get Kevin
to stay in the light.

192
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,281
Just-just don't shoot us.

193
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:02,116
Don't shoot.

194
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:05,021
He won't hurt anyone now.

195
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,322
You may find
your way out of here,

196
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,592
but you will have to hurt
a lot of officers.

197
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:13,261
A lot of people.

198
00:19:13,263 --> 00:19:16,465
No one needs to get hurt
anymore, David.

199
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:31,478
It's gonna be okay, Joseph.

200
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,714
Take them straight to

201
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:36,117
Raven Hill Memorial, the West
Wing of Raven Hill Memorial.

202
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,189
Grab that poncho!

203
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:58,576
No trouble.

204
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:15,058
Keep moving.

205
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,725
Keep moving.

206
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,193
Please, don't. Don't.

207
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,360
- Don't. No.
- Easy. Easy.

208
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:22,196
Hey. Hey! Hey!

209
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:23,831
We're cool, we're cool.
Totally cool.

210
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,398
All right?
He doesn't like to be touched.

211
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,235
I can, I can walk.
I'll just, I'll... walk.

212
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:30,072
Keep walking.

213
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,171
My name is Dr. Ellie Staple,
and I'm a psychiatrist.

214
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:07,308
This room must look nefarious.

215
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,177
The walls are equipped with
46 high-pressured nozzles,

216
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,313
all connected
to a 15,000-gallon

217
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,515
water tank outside.

218
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,586
It will only be triggered
if you are threatening

219
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,754
or trying to escape.

220
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:22,058
This is a hypnosis light...

221
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,127
Dennis.

222
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:29,196
My pleasure, Dennis.

223
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,331
You are being monitored.

224
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,199
If, for some reason,
there's a threatening identity

225
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:35,202
in the room, the light
will automatically strobe

226
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,738
and force a different identity
to take over.

227
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,205
Who was the man?

228
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:42,475
He was as strong as The Beast.

229
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:45,212
The man people in this city
have been talking about.

230
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:47,782
The only person
to survive that train wreck

231
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,650
all those years ago.

232
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:52,352
I saw a video of you fighting

233
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,689
near a fire hydrant
that erupted.

234
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,223
Saw you choke.

235
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,894
I think you believe
water is your weakness.

236
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,360
Where are you keeping him?

237
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:15,644
<i>Everyone is safe, David.</i>

238
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:21,649
Maybe this will all make sense
if I explain who I am.

239
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:26,353
I specialize in a particular
type of delusion of grandeur.

240
00:22:26,356 --> 00:22:29,255
I specialize
in those individuals

241
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:32,193
who believe
they are superheroes.

242
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:34,195
I've been given three days

243
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:37,265
to treat you
by whatever means necessary.

244
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:42,670
I came here for you both.

245
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:10,666
<i>Yo, this doctor comes in here,</i>

246
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,300
takes over our wing,
tells us all new rules.

247
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:15,736
Rules of conduct.

248
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:19,407
How to treat people
with kindness.

249
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:21,842
My whole life, all I do
is take care of people.

250
00:23:21,844 --> 00:23:25,378
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. There you go.

251
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,616
We got along just fine
without her, didn't we?

252
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:28,949
Me and you?

253
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:33,855
Anyway...

254
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:36,858
you won't be lonely anymore.

255
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:39,426
You have two new friends.

256
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:02,284
Casey, could I see you
for a second?

257
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,426
<i>I received a call
from your foster family.</i>

258
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:15,763
Apparently, it's on the news.

259
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:18,532
They caught the guy
who abducted you

260
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:21,301
and murdered all those girls.

261
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,038
They caught the bastard.

262
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,573
Your foster family is thrilled.

263
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:29,644
I can imagine how much relief
this causes you.

264
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:32,380
I'm sure you've been
thinking about him.

265
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:38,253
I... have been
thinking about him.

266
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:59,406
They, uh, told me to bring
lots of options.

267
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,280
Hey, cutie.

268
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:08,381
Think you could help me?

269
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,850
I'm Jade.

270
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:12,954
They gave me a syringe for
my diabetes, but I dropped it.

271
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:15,657
My hands get shaky
when I get low blood sugar.

272
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:17,658
It's a little too close
to the light.

273
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,763
Do you think you could
pick it up for me?

274
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:37,946
Wow.

275
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:39,513
Stand up.

276
00:25:39,514 --> 00:25:42,619
Let me get a good look at you.

277
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:50,859
You are so tall.

278
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,129
Orwell and Barry are so angry
with me that I flipped.

279
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,799
But the truth is

280
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:01,869
we really can do things
that you can't do.

281
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:04,741
I don't understand.

282
00:26:17,588 --> 00:26:20,088
Hey. Hey. Hey!

283
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:24,759
I'm Ian.

284
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:27,862
- All right?
- I'm Ian.

285
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:30,799
And I'm Mary Reynolds.
We're twins.

286
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,734
Do you know
what would have happened

287
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,169
if she'd have gotten
to that key, you gobshite?

288
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,937
The Horde would have killed ya.

289
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:38,504
What've you got?

290
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:41,076
You get a little,
get a little hard-on? Daryl.

291
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:43,476
Just calm down, okay?

292
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:48,215
I'm sorry
for being with the Horde.

293
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:50,217
It's just, it's just...

294
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:52,853
Oh, do you know,
I am tired of being sorry.

295
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:54,822
You can call me Norma.

296
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:57,058
I am sorry about
the whole lying thing.

297
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,194
- Though I'm not lying.
- Bro, just stop talking!

298
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,830
I was so amped!

299
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:05,465
We almost got you, bro!

300
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:07,569
Trying to keep him here
with this light thing?

301
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:10,773
- That's some buttery shit!
- Stop talking.

302
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:14,542
I'm not
supposed to be in the light.

303
00:27:14,543 --> 00:27:16,645
Uh, we need more time.

304
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,478
Barry is
speaking to Kevin,

305
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,048
trying to get him
near the light.

306
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,685
Is he close enough yet?

307
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,089
The only one who can defend us is him!

308
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,557
Him!

309
00:27:43,974 --> 00:27:47,141
Where is the man
in the rain poncho?

310
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:50,578
Who is he?

311
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,549
Is he just a regular man?
I need to know.

312
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:59,587
All right, step away from
the controls now, little duck.

313
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:02,457
That's fine.
Now just walk away.

314
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:13,068
That's it.

315
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,004
Just tiptoe away.

316
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:20,274
I try to come once every week.

317
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:21,943
Sometimes, I admit,

318
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:24,611
I have neglected a week
here and there.

319
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:29,016
He's changed over the years.

320
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:32,152
I can tell he's given up.

321
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:35,156
It's hard to see.

322
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:38,025
He thinks he was a mistake.

323
00:28:38,027 --> 00:28:40,594
I'm not saying
he did good things.

324
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:42,030
He didn't.

325
00:28:42,032 --> 00:28:45,635
Those poor people didn't
deserve to die like that.

326
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,705
But he's trying
to make sense of who he is.

327
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:53,776
Ain't we all doing that?

328
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:56,812
Yes, ma'am, we are.

329
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:02,617
They keep him heavily sedated.

330
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:05,153
This is an enormous amount
of sedation.

331
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:07,054
He's too smart for 'em.

332
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:09,057
When they first
brought him here,

333
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:12,060
he memorized a blueprint
left out from an electrician

334
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:16,532
and short-circuited the power
to the whole hospital.

335
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:20,637
He's good
thinking through things.

336
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:24,671
He has this notion

337
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:28,709
that superheroes are
based on people like him,

338
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:32,813
and that other gentleman
I read is here, Mr. Dunn.

339
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,815
Would it surprise you to know

340
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:38,986
there are more and more people
who have this delusion?

341
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:42,724
It is actually
the center of my work.

342
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:46,061
Yes, it would.

343
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:53,169
You don't let them
get you down, Elijah.

344
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,673
You hear me?

345
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,373
Stay proud.

346
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:10,186
Step back
against the wall, please.

347
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:15,183
You're keeping him here
without guards?

348
00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:17,918
I have to get out of here
before he gets out.

349
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,257
The individual
who came with you is contained.

350
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:25,059
David.

351
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:29,062
I would like you to agree
to have an MRI.

352
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:31,432
You were the sole survivor of
a devastating train derailment

353
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:32,900
19 years ago.

354
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:35,069
It is possible that there was

355
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,873
damage to the frontal lobe
that you are unaware of.

356
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:56,157
Look at you, David.

357
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:59,159
You believe you have barely
enough strength to stand up.

358
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:01,997
You can't possibly
explain everything away.

359
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:11,839
Madam, I am Mr. Pritchard.

360
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,975
I'm a professor of cinema.

361
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,811
Specifically, Japanese,
1950s through the 1980s.

362
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:19,847
And I have absolutely no idea
what I'm doing here.

363
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:21,983
I am very much in favor
of Kevin's reemergence,

364
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,985
and yet I find myself
in a goddamn prison cell!

365
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,120
And I can assure you
I am not...

366
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:33,093
Okay.

367
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:56,283
I'm ready.

368
00:32:57,588 --> 00:33:00,921
Young man, wait!

369
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:03,524
You will not be able
to get to the light.

370
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:06,127
It is set off by distance

371
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:08,428
as well as being monitored
by a camera.

372
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,567
I know this seems
very unfair to you...

373
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:14,968
...but you are stuck
in this room.

374
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:17,472
The guy The Beast fought,
he's right there!

375
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:20,475
He can't beat The Beast.

376
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:24,044
He doesn't think he can
beat The Beast, does he? Huh?

377
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,446
Beast like...

378
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,187
He doesn't think he can
beat The Beast, does he?

379
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:37,157
Beast like...

380
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,994
Your name is Hedwig, right?

381
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:43,430
You're nine, right?

382
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:45,265
Yeah.

383
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:47,100
Forever?

384
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:52,341
No matter how many
experiences you have?

385
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:57,946
That must be so hard.

386
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,482
You treat people who think

387
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:03,953
they're comic book characters
or something?

388
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,360
I got to go.

389
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:15,230
Miss Patricia says
she wants the light.

390
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:29,976
Hello, Patricia.

391
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:33,147
- I'm Dr. Staple.
- I've gathered.

392
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:38,118
As I understand it, you're
kind of the high priestess.

393
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:41,489
This cause isn't about me.

394
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:43,592
It's about The Beast, is it?

395
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:45,192
Where is he?

396
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:47,931
- Who?
- The man.

397
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,998
He is guarded, isn't he?

398
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,902
He can't get out?

399
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,382
He's well-intentioned
and you would love him.

400
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:11,085
He's, like, a huge,
he's a big trickster.

401
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,186
He's a, he's a,
he's a great guy.

402
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:14,723
He's got
a great sense of humor.

403
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:18,726
- So, let me recap what you've told me.
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:22,563
Your dad is not the Green Guard
or "whatever his name is."

405
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:26,433
Your dad is a trickster,
and that I would love him.

406
00:35:26,435 --> 00:35:29,571
He thought it would be fun
to be a do-gooder for a day,

407
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,105
pretend he was this guy.

408
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,206
And with regard
to how he found the girls,

409
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,375
you retold a humorous story
where your dad thought

410
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:37,545
the killer might be
in the factory area

411
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:40,715
because his friend Lou...
you referred to him as Louie

412
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,317
at a different point...
got mugged down there once.

413
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:45,319
Then your father was
walking by a building,

414
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:50,190
hears girls screaming for help,
at which point you spiritedly

415
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:52,560
reenacted this moment
in the story.

416
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:54,027
Thank you for that.

417
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,197
Then your father
called you on the cell.

418
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,500
You told him to call
the police, but he was,

419
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:02,002
"In it, you know. In it."

420
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:03,404
Right.

421
00:36:03,406 --> 00:36:06,139
I'll sign that
in front of a judge.

422
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:08,243
So, you see,
he shouldn't be here.

423
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:13,116
How long have you believed
your dad was a superhero?

424
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,083
There was a microphone
on his poncho.

425
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:19,353
I assume he was communicating
with you.

426
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:22,623
He talks to you
when he's out on searches,

427
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,157
doesn't he, Joseph?

428
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,259
He hasn't hurt anybody.

429
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:29,730
In the eyes of the authorities,
that is not accurate.

430
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:31,331
He's injured
countless individuals

431
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,601
who haven't had
their due process in court.

432
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:36,170
And there was a teenage girl
in this latest incident

433
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,739
- who broke her arm and ribs.
- No.

434
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:39,139
They would all be
murder victims

435
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:40,576
if it wasn't for my dad.

436
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:43,411
It was a vigilante event,
and a victim was injured.

437
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:46,313
They will claim, in court, that
if they had found the girls,

438
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:49,750
no one would have been hurt.

439
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:52,753
Joseph, I only have a few days.

440
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:55,790
If I don't get him to give up
his delusion, he will remain

441
00:36:55,793 --> 00:37:00,194
in institutions like this
for the rest of his life.

442
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,196
No, he can't stay here.

443
00:37:02,197 --> 00:37:05,601
Can I ask you about
your mother, Joseph?

444
00:37:05,603 --> 00:37:07,735
What does that
have to do with this?

445
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:11,806
She passed away from
acute lymphoblastic leukemia

446
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,842
five years ago.

447
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:20,616
That was cataclysmic
for you and your dad.

448
00:37:20,618 --> 00:37:23,384
Yeah.

449
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:26,219
On the surface, Joseph,
you can see

450
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:29,190
what I'm going to say, right?

451
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,324
You lost your mother.

452
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:34,362
You believe your father
is a real-life superhero.

453
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:36,764
You believe
he is almost immortal.

454
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:41,270
You can see how some would say
you need this to be true.

455
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:44,572
You just have to make sure

456
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:47,875
you are not
more into this than he is.

457
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:11,299
I'm not scared.

458
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:13,234
That's great.

459
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:15,337
You know why?

460
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,473
I know now.

461
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:22,145
Know what?

462
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,616
Your secret identity.

463
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:30,319
That man was right.

464
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,493
Joseph.

465
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,663
There are big guys
in almost every gym

466
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:44,264
that can lift that much.

467
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:47,502
You could've lifted more.

468
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:51,371
Don't worry.

469
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,243
I won't tell anyone.

470
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:35,348
<i>Just because he let you go</i>

471
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:37,585
<i>doesn't mean he is good.</i>

472
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:40,554
He's being held here
before his trial.

473
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,623
I'm in charge of him for now,

474
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:47,196
but everyone in this state
wants him tried and put away.

475
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:50,699
I'm trying to get the others

476
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:55,235
to stop thinking of this
as a superhuman being.

477
00:39:55,237 --> 00:39:57,505
If they do,
they will do the right thing

478
00:39:57,507 --> 00:39:59,777
and keep him from the light.

479
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,581
Can I talk with them?

480
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,185
No.

481
00:40:11,253 --> 00:40:12,853
Why?

482
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,792
Because it's not...

483
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:20,797
You're the victim.

484
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:51,025
No way!

485
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:54,462
You tried so hard
to get away from us

486
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:56,464
and now you come back
and see us?

487
00:40:56,465 --> 00:40:59,000
You are so weird.

488
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,835
I like Drake now.

489
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:04,005
I liked Nicki for a while, but
then Nicki and Drake broke up,

490
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,473
and you can't like both.

491
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,375
This place is
for people who think

492
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:10,344
that they're
comic book characters.

493
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:11,679
And the Horde is kind of like

494
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,848
a comic book character name,
isn't it?

495
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:21,690
Love comic books.

496
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:26,060
I'm sorry for trying to feed
you to The Beast, et cetera.

497
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:29,797
It's okay.

498
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,333
Can I talk to Dennis
or Patricia, please?

499
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:34,869
She was my girlfriend.

500
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:36,772
We kissed.

501
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,808
Don't worry.
I haven't cheated on you.

502
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:49,552
What are you doing here?

503
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,723
Your clothes are not dirty.

504
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,958
Good.

505
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,395
Hello, Dennis.

506
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:03,964
A lot of people have died.

507
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:07,433
Well...

508
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:11,471
You have to give up the light.

509
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:13,473
They're never gonna
let you out of here.

510
00:42:13,476 --> 00:42:16,580
The Horde has to
give up the light.

511
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,917
Listen to this doctor.

512
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:25,719
The doc tells lies.

513
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:29,456
We will reveal that the broken
are the strongest.

514
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,491
The Beast will start
a revolution.

515
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,127
Is that what Patricia
told you to say?

516
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,864
The Beast is the highest form
of human evolution.

517
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:39,634
Dennis. You guys are gonna die.

518
00:42:39,636 --> 00:42:41,469
Casey.

519
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:46,107
Ah... oh...

520
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:48,076
Oh, sh...

521
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:03,491
Hey.

522
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:07,828
Kevin?

523
00:43:07,831 --> 00:43:09,766
It's you.

524
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:22,509
You look different.

525
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:25,980
I wanted to tell you something.

526
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:29,116
My uncle's in jail.

527
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:31,420
I put him there.

528
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:38,560
What he did to me was... wrong.

529
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:42,596
Just like what your mom
did to you was wrong.

530
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,835
We're the same?

531
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:55,844
I'm sorry.

532
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:57,712
- I can't. I got...
- Kevin, wait.

533
00:43:57,714 --> 00:44:01,016
I've got to go.
I've got to go.

534
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:05,819
The Horde is never
letting go of the light and...

535
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,560
Do you like Kevin now?

536
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:16,697
Casey. I need you.

537
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:19,668
The power of true,
loving, physical affection,

538
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,735
it's like something
supernatural.

539
00:44:21,737 --> 00:44:23,871
It's the lack of it
that caused this,

540
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:26,641
and only the true version of it
can heal it.

541
00:44:26,643 --> 00:44:28,011
Will you help me?

542
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,009
<i>You are the last
person I need to see today.</i>

543
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,844
You see this camera?

544
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:07,047
There are 100 more of these.

545
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:09,150
Out of respect for
your cognitive abilities,

546
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:12,886
I have installed cameras
on every floor, every area,

547
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:15,723
including every direction
of the exterior building.

548
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:17,759
We will see everything.

549
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:21,628
There is nowhere you can go
that won't be documented.

550
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,032
Elijah. I've come
to the conclusion

551
00:45:25,034 --> 00:45:28,703
that we should perform
a procedure on you.

552
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:31,772
This is a corrective procedure
that rebalances

553
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,342
the part of the frontal lobe
that is overstimulated.

554
00:45:35,344 --> 00:45:39,147
It would be an honor to get to
know your perspicacious mind.

555
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:43,619
We're going to conduct
the procedure in three days.

556
00:45:57,734 --> 00:46:00,235
12!

557
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:03,804
Keep going!

558
00:46:09,813 --> 00:46:11,813
Right there, right there!

559
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:38,739
Hey, my man.

560
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:40,909
How'd you get out of your room?

561
00:46:40,911 --> 00:46:43,177
You must have
left the door ajar.

562
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:45,179
He rolled out toward the noise.

563
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:48,248
Wheel him back in
before the doctor sees.

564
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,418
Oh, you're too nice, Daryl.

565
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,119
You got to be firm.

566
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:55,089
They'll walk all over you
otherwise.

567
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:58,326
He didn't touch
any of the medicines, did he?

568
00:46:58,328 --> 00:47:00,994
No.

569
00:47:00,996 --> 00:47:02,965
Right amounts.

570
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:33,293
<i>This will be
my final evaluation.</i>

571
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:45,105
You got to be kidding me.

572
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:47,875
This guy killed everyone
on my train.

573
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:50,846
He's a mass murderer.

574
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:05,226
I understand
that the three of you

575
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:07,795
think you are superhuman.

576
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:09,964
That you don't think
you are normal.

577
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:14,235
You've convinced yourselves
you have extraordinary gifts,

578
00:48:14,237 --> 00:48:17,804
like something
out of a comic book.

579
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:20,440
I am here to discuss
the possibility

580
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:23,210
that you are mistaken.

581
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:26,683
Can you tell me about
Kevin's parents?

582
00:48:30,353 --> 00:48:33,453
Kevin's mother...

583
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:36,023
hurt Kevin.

584
00:48:36,025 --> 00:48:40,228
And Kevin's father
was gonna get a doctor

585
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,167
to try and stop her,
but he left.

586
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,973
I never wanted any of this.

587
00:48:52,475 --> 00:48:54,775
What?

588
00:48:54,777 --> 00:48:56,279
The killings.

589
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,264
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

590
00:49:18,536 --> 00:49:22,302
- Kevin Wendell Crumb.
- Kevin Wendell Crumb!

591
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,040
What did I tell you?!

592
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:28,109
There is no running
in the house,

593
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,310
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

594
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:34,147
Kevin?

595
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:38,453
Kevin.

596
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:41,022
Why do you all
keep bringing me back?

597
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,991
I-I don't want to be here.

598
00:49:42,993 --> 00:49:46,226
The need for the particular
story we tell ourselves

599
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:47,596
begins somewhere, Kevin.

600
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:49,598
From a memory.

601
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,534
What?

602
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,002
I don't...

603
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:57,237
Hey, where's that girl?

604
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,339
Casey. Sh-She...

605
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:04,177
Everybody wants the light now.

606
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:06,179
They're all fighting,
et cetera.

607
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:07,982
And Miss Patricia's
yelling at me,

608
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:09,618
saying I got to hold on
to the light.

609
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:13,420
She said I have one job to do:
keep Kevin out of the light.

610
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:15,590
So, I'm sorry,
you won't see him anymore.

611
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:20,895
And you have to listen
to her, right?

612
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:23,331
Because she's an adult
and you're not.

613
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,433
Duh. Yeah.

614
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,201
Is he crying?

615
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:30,203
Geez, pussy.

616
00:50:30,206 --> 00:50:33,373
Listen, I don't know about
these other guys,

617
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,076
but we are like a superhero.

618
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:37,545
No? We're like...

619
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:39,382
We're not crazy!

620
00:50:41,284 --> 00:50:46,420
David, I don't think
this applies just to Kevin

621
00:50:46,422 --> 00:50:48,589
and his disorder.

622
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:50,625
Is there a memory?

623
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:52,960
What you're looking for

624
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:55,228
is a moment of weakness
that made you

625
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,266
possibly entertain the idea
of being super strong.

626
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:34,270
There is a reason I ask you.

627
00:51:37,574 --> 00:51:39,875
This is your MRI, David.

628
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:47,514
This is your frontal lobe.

629
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:51,451
There is a questionable cloud
right here.

630
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:54,054
There is the possibility

631
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:56,958
that that is damage
from that train accident.

632
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,429
I'm supposed to believe
this means something?

633
00:52:05,435 --> 00:52:08,402
It's just this,
plus an anchoring incident,

634
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:12,574
and you would have the pattern
for this disorder that I treat.

635
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:27,054
I hate to see you like this.

636
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:29,123
This is not
how I would've done things.

637
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:33,194
I don't approve of
how they've handled you.

638
00:52:33,196 --> 00:52:35,196
Elijah, because of
your condition,

639
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:37,565
I didn't have to do
an MRI on you.

640
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,735
There are a few in your file.

641
00:52:39,737 --> 00:52:41,737
You definitely have
one of the markers

642
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:43,605
for this disorder, Elijah.

643
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:45,308
As do you, Kevin.

644
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,409
These are the medical reasons

645
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:52,179
I'm thinking
you have this disorder.

646
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:55,116
Now let's deal with
why you think you don't.

647
00:52:55,118 --> 00:53:01,022
How do you know who's good
and who's bad, David?

648
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:03,125
Convince me.

649
00:53:06,094 --> 00:53:08,362
It's a feeling.

650
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:09,797
An intuition?

651
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:12,768
When you see someone?

652
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,703
I have to touch them.

653
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:17,574
What does the intuition
feel like?

654
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:22,543
A vision.

655
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:24,712
A moment.

656
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:27,181
A sin.

657
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:30,451
You kind of
have to interpret it.

658
00:53:30,453 --> 00:53:33,119
Have you ever seen
very good magicians, David?

659
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:36,389
I mean, the very best.

660
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,292
They are trained as mentalists,

661
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:41,730
and they can do
seemingly extraordinary feats.

662
00:53:41,732 --> 00:53:44,665
They accomplish these feats by
interpreting hundreds of cues

663
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:48,536
that an individual is
giving off in a split second.

664
00:53:48,538 --> 00:53:53,440
I think you are like these
professional guessers, David.

665
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:58,411
You are world-class at it,
simply extraordinary at it.

666
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:03,851
But it is based on real things,
and you are making the picture.

667
00:54:03,853 --> 00:54:07,357
It is not coming to you
through mystical means.

668
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:16,732
These are the clothes
that the patient next to you

669
00:54:16,734 --> 00:54:18,567
came in with when he arrived.

670
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:21,703
There's red clay
staining the pants.

671
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:24,304
It's very visible.

672
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:31,612
Is it possible that you saw
something on the news...

673
00:54:31,614 --> 00:54:34,683
- Sorry, bro.
- <i>...then saw an adult acting like a child,</i>

674
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:38,719
someone who fit the bill
of someone with this disorder,

675
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:42,123
intuited, "This might be
the person I'm looking for"?

676
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,324
Saw the red clay

677
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:48,697
and thought he might be hiding
in a place with red clay?

678
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:50,699
No.

679
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,335
You're certain?

680
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:59,375
You're... creating a chain of
thoughts that never happened.

681
00:55:07,215 --> 00:55:10,484
You really dissected him,
Doctor.

682
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:12,853
Good for you.

683
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:15,690
As I understand it,
there were many videos

684
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,525
of world-class rock climbers

685
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:20,293
on the computer
in your office at the zoo.

686
00:55:20,295 --> 00:55:22,630
It was kind of an obsession.

687
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:24,565
Some of those climbers

688
00:55:24,567 --> 00:55:27,935
could actually scale
a literal wall, couldn't they?

689
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,806
What's your point, Doctor?

690
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,373
It was a practical observation

691
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,645
that produced a practical
skill set in an alter.

692
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:39,848
Mm.

693
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:42,650
Then how did he bend the bars?

694
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:45,353
The iron bars at the zoo?

695
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:49,322
You did see those, didn't you?

696
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:50,891
That's not in our heads.

697
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:52,493
The cages beneath the zoo

698
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:55,663
were made in 1874
when the zoo first opened.

699
00:55:55,665 --> 00:55:59,366
I was able to bend them by
putting a wrench between them

700
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:00,500
and leaning back.

701
00:56:00,502 --> 00:56:04,639
Difficult, again, but possible.

702
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:06,607
No.

703
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,409
What about the shotgun?

704
00:56:08,411 --> 00:56:10,545
He was shot.
Not once but twice.

705
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:12,547
What does your sleeping mind
think of that?

706
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:14,882
We've analyzed the shotgun
and the cartridges.

707
00:56:14,884 --> 00:56:16,484
They were very old.

708
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:19,554
There was a lot of moisture
from the boiler room

709
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:22,322
down in the locker area
where they were kept.

710
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:24,826
The cartridges were
possibly compromised.

711
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:28,328
And some of the pellets
hit the inside of the bars.

712
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:32,634
It is at least possible

713
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:35,572
that there is a practical
explanation for this.

714
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,714
What if I suggested
something upsetting, Patricia?

715
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:50,886
Like The Beast isn't
as powerful as you think.

716
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:55,589
He's not much more powerful
than a strong man.

717
00:56:55,592 --> 00:56:59,295
The facts you are basing
your belief in are wrong.

718
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:06,737
If superheroes exist, why are
there only three of you?

719
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:16,509
<i>When was the first
comic book written?</i>

720
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:20,848
The first reprints of newspaper
strips in tabloid size

721
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:22,784
happened in 1929.

722
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:27,621
And then, in 1938,
the apotheosis happened.

723
00:57:27,623 --> 00:57:29,891
Action Comics Number One
launched

724
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:33,493
with the man in the cape and
the blue tights on the cover.

725
00:57:33,496 --> 00:57:34,462
Boo-yah!

726
00:57:34,464 --> 00:57:36,496
Here we are.

727
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:45,542
Thank you.

728
00:57:50,378 --> 00:57:52,848
What are you doing back there?

729
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:55,449
You're not one of those
Hello Kitty pervs?

730
00:57:55,451 --> 00:57:57,821
I'm just looking for something.

731
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:02,656
Prove to someone I'm not crazy.

732
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:04,627
I'm leaving.

733
00:59:12,563 --> 00:59:14,429
Oh, my God.

734
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,656
- Catch.
- You're it.

735
01:00:24,134 --> 01:00:26,737
- Let's play hot potato, guys.
- Let's play hot potato!

736
01:00:28,503 --> 01:00:32,040
Hot potato. Hot potato.

737
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:34,074
<i>Hot potato. Hot potato.</i>

738
01:00:34,076 --> 01:00:35,810
Hot potato.
Hot potato. Hot potato.

739
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:37,645
Hot potato! Hot potato! Hot!

740
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:39,080
- You're out.
- You're out.

741
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:40,081
Come on, ready?

742
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:42,585
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>No!</i>

743
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:49,790
Hot potato.
Hot potato. Hot potato.

744
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:51,592
Hot potato.
Hot potato. Hot potato.

745
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:53,127
Hot potato! Hot!

746
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:55,764
I'm just asking you to bring in
a package if you see one

747
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:58,735
instead of stepping over it
to come in the house.

748
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:09,779
Hello?

749
01:01:51,288 --> 01:01:55,290
If, by mistake,
I-I drop this...

750
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,728
heavy flashlight
on your paper legs...

751
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:03,732
...no one would come
check on you for some time,

752
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:06,802
not until Daryl gets here
for his shift.

753
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,978
Have you been getting
out of your room, Elijah?

754
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:46,710
I must be losing my mind.

755
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:14,802
Night, Joe.

756
01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:16,906
Have a good night.

757
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,244
- Daryl.
- Hey, my man.

758
01:03:24,246 --> 01:03:25,846
You almost made it.

759
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:29,116
I think your watch is fast.

760
01:03:29,118 --> 01:03:30,384
Joe, my man.

761
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:31,886
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

762
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:33,321
- What's happening?
- Looking tired, man.

763
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:34,688
You still taking
that multivitamin?

764
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,623
Not like I should.

765
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,725
Yeah, but, listen,
you got to take the D.

766
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:38,793
If you don't take vitamin D,

767
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:40,994
none of that stuff's gonna
absorb into your body.

768
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:59,406
Clarence Wendell Crumb.

769
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:21,529
Take a little bit
of grape seed extract,

770
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:22,964
and it'll keep it all in there.

771
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,831
You'll absorb it
into your body faster.

772
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,534
Let me ask you,
how much water you drinking?

773
01:05:26,536 --> 01:05:29,837
- Not enough.
- Yeah. I know.

774
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:57,264
How?

775
01:05:57,266 --> 01:06:01,969
How did you get here
without anyone seeing?

776
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:04,138
The sound of
a car backfiring occurs

777
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:07,407
when unburned fuel vapor is
ignited by a very hot muffler

778
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:09,344
upon the car being turned off.

779
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:11,346
Daryl, who takes over
at 11:00 p.m.,

780
01:06:11,348 --> 01:06:13,880
suffers from this particular
vehicular malady.

781
01:06:13,882 --> 01:06:16,817
It happened seven minutes ago.

782
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:18,987
Couple that with the fact
that I've overheard complaints

783
01:06:18,989 --> 01:06:21,154
about how long it takes him
to get to his desk...

784
01:06:21,156 --> 01:06:23,190
he's a bit of a talker,
you see...

785
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:26,094
I estimate I have
two to three minutes left.

786
01:06:26,096 --> 01:06:29,565
Someone has been pretending.

787
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:31,031
Pilfered the aspirin bottle.

788
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:33,868
Replaced the original dose
of medicine

789
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,571
with the same amount
of aspirin.

790
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:37,038
Did sleight of hand
with the pills

791
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,507
given to me to take daily.

792
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:41,842
What do you want?

793
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:43,911
Ma'am.

794
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:46,214
I'm here to see

795
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:49,049
if the tales of the
extraordinary being are real,

796
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:52,052
- the half-man, half-creature.
- Patricia.

797
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:54,790
But I appreciate your manners.

798
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,161
I don't know anymore.

799
01:07:00,163 --> 01:07:02,063
I'm a comic book expert,
Patricia.

800
01:07:02,065 --> 01:07:04,898
I believe comic books are
a continuation of documentation

801
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:09,002
that has gone on for centuries
of what humans are capable of.

802
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:14,208
That they are what someone
somewhere saw or felt.

803
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:16,877
Are you aware that spandex,
the underwear on the outside,

804
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,482
and boots come from strongmen
in the circus in the 1930s?

805
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:23,083
- No.
- The freak show men

806
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:25,353
who could do
incredible feats of strength.

807
01:07:25,355 --> 01:07:29,625
I urge you to look past the
capes and monologuing villains.

808
01:07:29,627 --> 01:07:31,359
Are you with me?

809
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,561
Yes.

810
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:35,330
I only have a minute left.

811
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:37,964
I believe The Beast
may be part of this.

812
01:07:37,967 --> 01:07:40,467
There are references
to man/animal characters.

813
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:44,237
The dual character, the man
who has abilities like animals.

814
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:47,241
I'd like to meet The Beast,
see if he's real.

815
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:49,509
If he is,

816
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:53,380
then I'll get us all
out of here tomorrow night.

817
01:07:57,554 --> 01:08:00,188
What's upsetting you, Patricia?

818
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,991
What if he can't do
these extraordinary things?

819
01:08:05,696 --> 01:08:09,397
What if he is just unwell?

820
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:11,101
Like you.

821
01:08:13,002 --> 01:08:17,705
Everything extraordinary
can be explained away,

822
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:21,409
and yet it is true.

823
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,544
I think deep down
you know this.

824
01:08:23,547 --> 01:08:28,081
Everything we will see and do
will have a basis in science.

825
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,084
But it will have limits.

826
01:08:30,085 --> 01:08:33,020
This is the real world,
not a cartoon.

827
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:38,025
And yet some of us
don't die from bullets.

828
01:08:38,026 --> 01:08:42,429
Some of us
can still bend steel.

829
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:46,366
That is not a fantasy.

830
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:49,203
Hmm.

831
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:52,641
If you really think
you can get us all out,

832
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:55,710
then you may meet The Beast.

833
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:59,415
But for your sake,
I hope he likes you.

834
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:04,051
Tomorrow night.

835
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:06,955
Call a board meeting
or whatever.

836
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:15,030
What do we call you, sir?

837
01:09:17,735 --> 01:09:22,938
First name, "Mr."
Last name, "Glass."

838
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:34,214
- What's going on?
- Be careful.

839
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:36,083
- What... Oh.
- Not too much pressure when restraining him.

840
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:37,218
Dr. Staple, what are you doing?

841
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:38,352
- It's a sedative.
- What?

842
01:09:38,353 --> 01:09:39,754
- I'm sorry to do this, Elijah.
- Ow!

843
01:09:39,757 --> 01:09:42,088
We saw footage of you
leaving your room last night.

844
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,490
- No. No.
- It seems you have been duping us.

845
01:09:43,493 --> 01:09:45,493
I've moved up the procedure
to this morning.

846
01:09:45,495 --> 01:09:46,594
Wait, I...

847
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,513
Thank you
for being careful, everyone.

848
01:10:06,516 --> 01:10:08,250
Good luck, Elijah.

849
01:10:09,587 --> 01:10:11,786
Nothing essential
is going to change

850
01:10:11,789 --> 01:10:13,754
about who you are.

851
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:16,058
I promise, my friend.

852
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,240
Elijah!

853
01:10:57,499 --> 01:11:00,500
Elijah!

854
01:11:02,673 --> 01:11:04,606
So let's all scream!

855
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:21,690
Elijah!

856
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:23,659
Ma'am, get ahold of yourself.

857
01:11:24,828 --> 01:11:27,529
Mama!

858
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:35,402
Elijah!

859
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:37,304
Stop the ride!

860
01:11:37,307 --> 01:11:39,472
- Ma'am, step down.
- Stop the ride!

861
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:24,384
Dinner, Elijah.

862
01:12:25,722 --> 01:12:27,420
How you doing?

863
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:31,759
You'll feel better tomorrow.

864
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:38,301
Pictures are crooked.

865
01:12:50,413 --> 01:12:52,914
Hey.

866
01:12:56,486 --> 01:13:00,423
Took a bitch-ass long time
to find the right piece.

867
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:22,811
<i>First name, "Mr."</i>

868
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:26,981
Last name, "Glass."

869
01:14:20,503 --> 01:14:22,637
You don't know
what it's like, Daryl.

870
01:14:22,638 --> 01:14:26,907
To be so different,
you don't know where you fit.

871
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:29,611
It's an awful feeling.

872
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:43,490
Hey there, buddy. What's up?

873
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:44,926
Patricia told us
you were coming.

874
01:14:44,928 --> 01:14:48,395
My name is Luke, and I am
Team Horde all the way.

875
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:50,498
Yeah, I can intro you
to everybody.

876
01:14:50,499 --> 01:14:52,534
I ain't no bad hombre to know.

877
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:54,703
Everybody's gonna tell you
that I got a big mouth, though,

878
01:14:54,704 --> 01:14:57,004
I spoil
the end of movies. Ain't true.

879
01:14:57,007 --> 01:14:59,874
Everybody knows the priest dies
at the end of <i>The Exorcist.</i>

880
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:04,678
The American Sublime.

881
01:15:04,681 --> 01:15:08,682
Do you even know
what that means? No.

882
01:15:08,685 --> 01:15:11,820
That is why
this world is a lost cause.

883
01:15:11,821 --> 01:15:13,655
That is why The Beast is

884
01:15:13,656 --> 01:15:15,790
the only thing that is
pure and meaningful...

885
01:15:15,793 --> 01:15:18,794
American Sublime refers to
Western paintings of landscapes

886
01:15:18,795 --> 01:15:21,562
and seascapes depicting
the immensity of nature.

887
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:23,565
The use of violent storms
in the distance

888
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:25,767
was a common practice.

889
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:28,401
Painting's of particular
interest to me.

890
01:15:31,642 --> 01:15:34,642
Hey, Miss Patricia says
that your bones can break

891
01:15:34,645 --> 01:15:36,710
if I, like,
tap them.

892
01:15:36,713 --> 01:15:37,913
Is that true?

893
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:39,445
Yes.

894
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:41,447
Uh, so what's your superpower?

895
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,587
Your-your mind?

896
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,856
What's mine?

897
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,061
You're nine forever, right?

898
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:55,062
Yeah.

899
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:57,566
That's incredible.

900
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,735
You can see the world
the way it really is.

901
01:16:00,736 --> 01:16:02,637
Always.

902
01:16:02,638 --> 01:16:05,106
Kid who can never grow old.

903
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:09,445
Are you ready?

904
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:15,883
Are you ready?

905
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:18,018
Yeah.

906
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:19,956
Whoa.

907
01:16:22,993 --> 01:16:26,160
This place is so cool,
Mr. Glass.

908
01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:29,463
I feel like dancing.

909
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:31,464
Then go ahead and dance.

910
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:33,535
Yeah! Check it!

911
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,377
Yeah.

912
01:16:49,018 --> 01:16:51,520
Oh, man.

913
01:17:40,904 --> 01:17:44,638
They've been lying to us all.

914
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:48,477
You believe?

915
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:51,981
Yes, I do.

916
01:17:54,551 --> 01:17:57,852
It's what I've believed
my whole life.

917
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:04,225
They are losing faith.

918
01:18:04,227 --> 01:18:09,864
My Horde is losing faith!

919
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:12,667
In comics...

920
01:18:12,669 --> 01:18:17,004
you would go to a public place
where all could see you.

921
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:20,842
A place celebrating
man's pedestrian achievements.

922
01:18:22,646 --> 01:18:27,715
But you need David
to convince them.

923
01:18:27,718 --> 01:18:30,285
You should fight him

924
01:18:30,286 --> 01:18:32,789
in front of the world.

925
01:18:34,725 --> 01:18:38,892
The tallest building
in this city is opening today.

926
01:18:38,895 --> 01:18:45,767
All the cameras in the world
will record you.

927
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:50,905
You can convince the Horde
and the world at the same time.

928
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:54,174
We exist.

929
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:04,651
Why are you
in this chair, child?

930
01:19:04,654 --> 01:19:08,722
My bones break easily.

931
01:19:08,725 --> 01:19:10,290
I was born this way.

932
01:19:10,293 --> 01:19:14,294
I've had 94 breaks in my life.

933
01:19:14,297 --> 01:19:17,932
I've known only pain.

934
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:20,968
Rejoice.

935
01:19:20,971 --> 01:19:27,241
You have suffered
and are now pure.

936
01:19:27,244 --> 01:19:31,945
I assume you were sent here
to be an avenging angel.

937
01:19:33,784 --> 01:19:36,950
How much do you want
to avenge us?

938
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:57,941
Well, that sounds like
the bad guys teaming up.

939
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:04,779
How you doing, David?

940
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:07,315
I always thought of us
as friends.

941
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:09,817
Elijah?

942
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,253
You shouldn't be hiding
in the shadows, David.

943
01:20:12,254 --> 01:20:15,123
You're able to hide
because people who steal cars

944
01:20:15,124 --> 01:20:18,959
and mug people in alleys
don't need your full potential.

945
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:20,861
You're only using
one percent of your abilities

946
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,429
with these petty criminals.

947
01:20:22,432 --> 01:20:25,967
Maybe there's nothing
to hide, Elijah.

948
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:27,368
I have found someone

949
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:31,271
who will require your
full potential to come out.

950
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:33,874
A superhuman serial killer.

951
01:20:33,877 --> 01:20:37,277
Don't do this.

952
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,880
How can we be the only ones?

953
01:20:39,883 --> 01:20:43,051
Maybe we believed something
that isn't even true.

954
01:20:44,154 --> 01:20:48,423
We are going to the
tallest building in the city.

955
01:20:48,424 --> 01:20:51,191
The Horde is going to be
revealed there.

956
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:52,794
There are three floors

957
01:20:52,795 --> 01:20:54,896
that house a chemical company
in that building.

958
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:57,030
I am going to blow up
that building

959
01:20:57,032 --> 01:20:58,900
using their chemicals, David.

960
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:02,736
You might want
to try and stop us.

961
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:05,405
Today is your coming-out party.

962
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:08,243
At least you know what to wear.

963
01:21:14,316 --> 01:21:17,819
I've turned off the water hoses
in your room, David.

964
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,454
- There's only the door left.
- Elijah.

965
01:21:20,456 --> 01:21:22,056
It's metal.

966
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:23,790
But you can't get through it

967
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:26,326
because people's bones break
against metal,

968
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:28,963
and you're nothing special.

969
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:34,102
A lot of people are
going to die, Overseer,

970
01:21:34,103 --> 01:21:37,938
if you don't get
through that door.

971
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,183
Hi.

972
01:22:09,172 --> 01:22:10,874
I'm here.

973
01:22:29,526 --> 01:22:31,124
Daryl?

974
01:23:26,915 --> 01:23:29,316
This is where
they would paint you

975
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:34,324
with big eyes and bubbles
of confusion above your head.

976
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:48,536
You... hurt him?

977
01:23:48,539 --> 01:23:50,471
What are you doing?

978
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:55,942
You should kneel before him.

979
01:23:55,945 --> 01:23:58,879
He is the broken.

980
01:23:58,882 --> 01:24:01,214
Step away from me.

981
01:24:01,217 --> 01:24:04,352
Get back in your room!
Both of you!

982
01:24:17,133 --> 01:24:20,234
You're fighting for the broken.

983
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:23,471
You found your purpose.

984
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:58,106
One of the Horde may need
to walk us out of here,

985
01:24:58,107 --> 01:25:01,477
if that's okay... partner.

986
01:26:09,713 --> 01:26:12,014
Go through the basement.

987
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:08,597
Listen to me, Joseph.

988
01:28:08,598 --> 01:28:10,665
Your father is making
great progress.

989
01:28:10,668 --> 01:28:13,301
I'm very hopeful for him.

990
01:28:13,303 --> 01:28:19,107
Did you know the first Superman
couldn't even fly?

991
01:28:20,476 --> 01:28:23,343
And Metropolis is actually
New York City.

992
01:28:23,346 --> 01:28:24,780
And what about
all the coincidences

993
01:28:24,781 --> 01:28:26,347
in what I was reading?

994
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:29,151
Comic books are an obsession.

995
01:28:30,386 --> 01:28:34,355
Have you ever been
to a comic book convention?

996
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:37,593
They sell teen TV shows there.

997
01:28:37,594 --> 01:28:40,596
They are selling things.

998
01:28:40,597 --> 01:28:45,636
Your friends and family members
have lost their perspective.

999
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:51,237
Your dad is trying
to fight her abductor.

1000
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,342
Your son is trying
to best his dad.

1001
01:28:54,343 --> 01:28:56,578
He's the anarchist.

1002
01:28:56,579 --> 01:28:58,746
He's the brains.
He's the reluctant hero.

1003
01:28:58,749 --> 01:29:02,383
This all sounds very familiar,
doesn't it?

1004
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:06,387
Comic books are not
valid history.

1005
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:19,467
Hey, what wing are you with?

1006
01:29:19,468 --> 01:29:22,335
Uh, The Beast
is saying that he'd like you

1007
01:29:22,338 --> 01:29:24,540
to roll forward when they come.

1008
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:30,178
I believe.

1009
01:29:30,914 --> 01:29:32,615
I believe.

1010
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:36,654
I believe.

1011
01:29:42,491 --> 01:29:44,293
I believe.

1012
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:39,880
The new Osaka building
opens today with much fanfare.

1013
01:30:39,883 --> 01:30:42,584
Thousands are expected
to come out for the ceremony.

1014
01:30:42,585 --> 01:30:44,852
Many just want to see
the spectacular architecture.

1015
01:30:44,855 --> 01:30:46,887
Now, this building is expected

1016
01:30:46,889 --> 01:30:49,023
to be the hub
of the business community,

1017
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,525
creating thousands of jobs...

1018
01:30:50,526 --> 01:30:52,593
We have a Code Three.

1019
01:30:52,596 --> 01:30:54,395
All patients locked
in their rooms.

1020
01:30:54,396 --> 01:30:56,496
Grounds security on alert.

1021
01:30:56,499 --> 01:30:58,298
The patients
are planning to go

1022
01:30:58,301 --> 01:30:59,968
to the public opening
of the Osaka Tower,

1023
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,468
the tallest building.

1024
01:31:01,471 --> 01:31:02,971
Elijah may be intending
to compromise

1025
01:31:02,972 --> 01:31:04,606
a chemical facility there.

1026
01:31:04,607 --> 01:31:07,374
Please alert the
Philadelphia Police Department.

1027
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:10,377
They made a mistake
going through the basement.

1028
01:31:10,379 --> 01:31:12,413
It gives us some time.

1029
01:31:12,414 --> 01:31:14,514
I remember something

1030
01:31:14,517 --> 01:31:16,785
about a classic public forum

1031
01:31:16,786 --> 01:31:19,620
where the climax
of limited editions end.

1032
01:31:19,623 --> 01:31:22,656
Uh, I think he said it was
referred to as the showdown,

1033
01:31:22,659 --> 01:31:25,060
where all the skills
are revealed

1034
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,696
and-and pitted
against each other.

1035
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:30,566
And then?

1036
01:31:31,935 --> 01:31:33,837
What happens?

1037
01:31:57,928 --> 01:31:59,727
Christ, they're out here.

1038
01:31:59,730 --> 01:32:01,029
They're out here!

1039
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:17,111
This is Dr. Ellie Staple.

1040
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:18,512
We will need assistance

1041
01:32:18,513 --> 01:32:20,851
at Raven Hill Memorial
immediately.

1042
01:32:41,871 --> 01:32:44,406
No!

1043
01:32:49,445 --> 01:32:51,745
How many people
are gonna die today?

1044
01:32:51,748 --> 01:32:53,013
Huh?

1045
01:32:53,016 --> 01:32:54,514
I don't want to do this.

1046
01:32:54,517 --> 01:32:56,017
I don't care
what Patricia says.

1047
01:32:56,018 --> 01:32:57,986
I'm not...

1048
01:32:57,987 --> 01:33:00,754
Hedwig's taking the light.

1049
01:33:00,757 --> 01:33:03,191
Hey, what's up?

1050
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:05,125
Don't worry.

1051
01:33:05,128 --> 01:33:06,761
We don't need him anyway.

1052
01:33:06,762 --> 01:33:09,897
There are still ten of us.

1053
01:33:16,005 --> 01:33:19,942
It appears The Beast
is not done here yet.

1054
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,232
We've got eyes on him.
Please advise.

1055
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:48,938
Please advise.

1056
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:10,727
The collection
of main characters.

1057
01:34:52,302 --> 01:34:56,637
Keep patients and staff away
from the south-side windows.

1058
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,607
Authorities are on their way.

1059
01:35:20,062 --> 01:35:21,596
Okay. I got you.

1060
01:35:28,938 --> 01:35:33,307
You will learn to kneel
before the broken.

1061
01:36:20,723 --> 01:36:23,357
I need to explain.
He has D.I.D.

1062
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,794
- He believes he's an animal.
- Keep moving.

1063
01:36:25,795 --> 01:36:27,227
No, you don't understand.

1064
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:28,829
All he knows is pain.

1065
01:36:28,831 --> 01:36:30,330
You're going to get hurt.

1066
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:32,032
Somebody, please...

1067
01:36:32,035 --> 01:36:33,767
He has D.I.D.

1068
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:35,370
We can get the compassionate
people inside him

1069
01:36:35,371 --> 01:36:36,838
- to help you.
- Stay here.

1070
01:36:36,839 --> 01:36:39,976
You're the girl
The Beast let go.

1071
01:37:09,873 --> 01:37:12,039
Stay away from him.

1072
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:14,611
Go!

1073
01:37:38,401 --> 01:37:40,538
I'm just trying to save you.

1074
01:38:15,905 --> 01:38:19,139
Casey, the light
won't work out here now.

1075
01:38:19,142 --> 01:38:22,110
You have to be the one
to get Kevin to come out.

1076
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:24,279
We need to get them
inside to safety.

1077
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,079
Do you hear me?

1078
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:29,049
Dad, there are two

1079
01:38:29,052 --> 01:38:30,317
tactical teams on the way.

1080
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,120
Get back inside!

1081
01:38:37,527 --> 01:38:39,160
Hurry.

1082
01:38:39,161 --> 01:38:40,762
Get inside the building.

1083
01:38:51,975 --> 01:38:54,543
The water
used for David's room.

1084
01:38:54,544 --> 01:38:56,311
There's water in that tank.

1085
01:38:56,312 --> 01:38:58,879
I know he almost drowned
when he was a child.

1086
01:38:58,882 --> 01:39:01,250
Water is his weakness.

1087
01:39:03,053 --> 01:39:04,485
Hey!

1088
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:05,520
- Hey!
- Joseph!

1089
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:06,987
He's lying to you.

1090
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:09,123
In comics, the parents
of the villains

1091
01:39:09,124 --> 01:39:11,959
always hold a key to understanding them.

1092
01:39:11,962 --> 01:39:13,928
He's not telling you something.

1093
01:39:13,929 --> 01:39:15,731
Joseph, get back!

1094
01:39:19,436 --> 01:39:22,303
Don't tell him yet.

1095
01:39:24,273 --> 01:39:28,544
Kevin's dad didn't just take
any train and not come home.

1096
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,460
Eastrail 177.

1097
01:39:46,463 --> 01:39:48,764
Next stop, Philadelphia.

1098
01:40:16,926 --> 01:40:19,494
<i>He took the train
my dad was on.</i>

1099
01:40:19,495 --> 01:40:23,232
<i>The one that everyone died
except my dad.</i>

1100
01:40:29,938 --> 01:40:31,941
That's the key to who you are.

1101
01:40:33,942 --> 01:40:36,977
Mr. Glass killed Kevin's dad.

1102
01:40:50,293 --> 01:40:53,026
It's all evidence, you see?

1103
01:40:53,029 --> 01:40:55,228
If that train crash
hadn't happened,

1104
01:40:55,231 --> 01:40:58,165
Kevin wouldn't have been
left alone with his mother.

1105
01:40:58,168 --> 01:40:59,601
If Kevin's mother
wasn't allowed

1106
01:40:59,602 --> 01:41:00,602
to continue to abuse him,

1107
01:41:00,603 --> 01:41:03,905
then The Beast
wouldn't have had to be born.

1108
01:41:03,906 --> 01:41:06,542
What are the odds
that David Dunn

1109
01:41:06,544 --> 01:41:12,548
and Clarence Wendell Crumb
would be together that day?

1110
01:41:12,549 --> 01:41:14,249
Amazing.

1111
01:41:15,919 --> 01:41:20,053
I created you,
as I created David.

1112
01:41:20,056 --> 01:41:23,659
It just took longer.

1113
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:26,127
19 years.

1114
01:41:26,129 --> 01:41:29,396
They almost convinced me
I was crazy.

1115
01:41:29,398 --> 01:41:34,035
I create superheroes.

1116
01:41:34,036 --> 01:41:38,673
I truly am a mastermind.

1117
01:41:40,276 --> 01:41:45,547
I thank you for what you did.

1118
01:41:45,548 --> 01:41:49,217
But I came to protect Kevin.

1119
01:41:49,218 --> 01:41:55,624
And I cannot trust you
to keep him safe.

1120
01:42:00,096 --> 01:42:01,495
Hey.

1121
01:42:01,498 --> 01:42:04,231
We still haven't settled
that kneeling thing.

1122
01:42:04,234 --> 01:42:07,200
The classic turn.

1123
01:42:07,203 --> 01:42:09,605
The enemy becomes the ally

1124
01:42:09,606 --> 01:42:14,511
because of the hero's
unflinching sense of good.

1125
01:43:45,535 --> 01:43:50,138
We will finish this
in front of the world.

1126
01:44:07,155 --> 01:44:09,225
Elijah.

1127
01:44:18,869 --> 01:44:20,570
Release me.

1128
01:44:25,107 --> 01:44:27,107
Let me talk
to Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1129
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:30,846
No!

1130
01:44:34,182 --> 01:44:36,584
Release me.

1131
01:44:36,587 --> 01:44:38,820
I need to talk
to Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1132
01:44:41,558 --> 01:44:43,624
He needs me.

1133
01:44:43,627 --> 01:44:45,660
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1134
01:44:47,764 --> 01:44:48,864
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1135
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,335
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1136
01:45:03,847 --> 01:45:05,615
Hey.

1137
01:45:07,651 --> 01:45:09,482
The Beast listened to me.

1138
01:45:09,485 --> 01:45:11,352
He couldn't do what he wanted.

1139
01:45:11,353 --> 01:45:13,486
You can tell him what to do.

1140
01:45:13,489 --> 01:45:17,223
- I'm not in charge of the light.
- Yes.

1141
01:45:17,226 --> 01:45:20,227
Yes, you are.

1142
01:45:22,298 --> 01:45:25,199
It feels good.

1143
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,735
Doesn't it?

1144
01:45:26,736 --> 01:45:29,570
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:45:29,572 --> 01:45:33,642
Will you stay
in the light with me?

1146
01:45:33,643 --> 01:45:35,579
For a little while?

1147
01:45:59,035 --> 01:46:02,536
She was able
to turn him. Target down.

1148
01:46:18,454 --> 01:46:20,821
You guys got to help him.
That's my dad.

1149
01:46:20,824 --> 01:46:22,423
He's trying to help you guys.

1150
01:46:22,424 --> 01:46:23,924
The guy in the green,
that's my dad.

1151
01:46:23,927 --> 01:46:26,695
He's trying to stop the Horde.
He's really weak.

1152
01:47:04,267 --> 01:47:06,701
David.

1153
01:47:06,704 --> 01:47:08,035
David, take my hand.

1154
01:47:08,038 --> 01:47:09,670
Take it now!

1155
01:47:34,429 --> 01:47:36,532
It's just us.

1156
01:47:41,471 --> 01:47:43,905
They sent me here
for you three.

1157
01:47:43,906 --> 01:47:46,907
Tell me the truth.

1158
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:50,279
Did I almost convince you
you were an ordinary man?

1159
01:47:53,482 --> 01:47:56,584
I would have left you alone,

1160
01:47:56,587 --> 01:48:01,691
but when the Horde showed up
here, then I just had to come.

1161
01:48:16,906 --> 01:48:19,540
Didn't you tell me
there was a showdown

1162
01:48:19,543 --> 01:48:21,843
at the end of a limited edition?

1163
01:48:21,844 --> 01:48:24,344
How come you didn't know
how it was gonna end?

1164
01:48:24,347 --> 01:48:25,914
Oh, Mama.

1165
01:48:25,915 --> 01:48:31,418
This is not a limited edition.

1166
01:48:31,419 --> 01:48:35,089
This was an origin story

1167
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:37,859
the whole time.

1168
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,984
What's happening?

1169
01:49:07,857 --> 01:49:09,990
I like being nine.

1170
01:49:11,861 --> 01:49:14,495
It... it hurts, Casey.

1171
01:49:14,496 --> 01:49:16,063
Get it to stop hurting.

1172
01:49:17,734 --> 01:49:22,102
I-I can't... hold on
to the light, Casey.

1173
01:49:25,441 --> 01:49:28,810
I should never
have listened to her.

1174
01:49:33,182 --> 01:49:35,883
Now these pants
got blood on them.

1175
01:49:35,886 --> 01:49:37,484
They're ruined.

1176
01:49:39,822 --> 01:49:42,857
We got to clean
these pants, Casey.

1177
01:49:44,928 --> 01:49:48,730
As his body slowly
succumbs to the inevitable,

1178
01:49:48,731 --> 01:49:54,169
a sensation of cold water
spreads through his body.

1179
01:49:54,170 --> 01:50:00,642
His thoughts are a mixture
of fear and sweet relief.

1180
01:50:02,713 --> 01:50:05,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Patricia.

1181
01:50:05,447 --> 01:50:07,915
We should all listen to her.

1182
01:50:09,887 --> 01:50:11,785
Did you see them?

1183
01:50:11,788 --> 01:50:15,624
They are both extraordinary.

1184
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:18,459
I never doubted. I...

1185
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:22,463
Never let them tell you
I doubted it.

1186
01:50:25,802 --> 01:50:27,669
They're all so scared.

1187
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:31,775
But I told them that I'm gonna
hold the light now.

1188
01:50:34,678 --> 01:50:37,780
You really my friend?

1189
01:50:40,683 --> 01:50:42,750
Then I'm gonna hold the light
till the end.

1190
01:50:42,753 --> 01:50:44,486
Till the very end.

1191
01:50:47,557 --> 01:50:50,426
It's not so bad
being in the light.

1192
01:50:59,035 --> 01:51:00,971
Kevin.

1193
01:51:37,273 --> 01:51:40,607
Would you mind
stepping away for a moment

1194
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:42,812
so I can check him?

1195
01:51:44,748 --> 01:51:46,850
It's okay.

1196
01:52:05,302 --> 01:52:07,637
They got it wrong
in the comics.

1197
01:52:09,338 --> 01:52:11,338
They talk about
secret evil groups

1198
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:13,874
trying to stop the heroes.

1199
01:52:13,877 --> 01:52:16,311
I don't think
we are particularly evil,

1200
01:52:16,312 --> 01:52:19,213
and we don't choose sides.

1201
01:52:19,215 --> 01:52:21,048
We try to stop both of you.

1202
01:52:21,051 --> 01:52:26,087
If there is one of you,
the opposite of you appears.

1203
01:52:26,088 --> 01:52:27,355
It escalates.

1204
01:52:27,356 --> 01:52:29,691
We step in.

1205
01:52:29,692 --> 01:52:33,695
There just can't be
gods amongst us.

1206
01:52:33,696 --> 01:52:35,096
It's not fair.

1207
01:52:35,097 --> 01:52:40,634
It has worked just fine
for 10,000 years our way.

1208
01:52:40,637 --> 01:52:42,870
Take consolation in the fact

1209
01:52:42,873 --> 01:52:46,173
that you were right
about your theory.

1210
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:49,111
Be at peace.

1211
01:53:08,664 --> 01:53:13,770
I wasn't a mistake, Mama.

1212
01:53:14,971 --> 01:53:16,106
No.

1213
01:53:18,174 --> 01:53:20,977
You were spectacular.

1214
01:53:38,027 --> 01:53:41,262
<i>These patients
were very disturbed.</i>

1215
01:53:41,263 --> 01:53:43,897
<i>Let me just simply state,
everything that occurred</i>

1216
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,034
<i>was related to drugs
in their systems</i>

1217
01:53:46,035 --> 01:53:48,002
<i>or their heightened
state of mania.</i>

1218
01:53:48,004 --> 01:53:50,004
<i>For the patients' privacy,</i>

1219
01:53:50,005 --> 01:53:51,873
let's keep what happened
in this building

1220
01:53:51,874 --> 01:53:54,678
and this parking lot
to ourselves.

1221
01:53:55,945 --> 01:53:57,078
...general public alike.

1222
01:53:57,079 --> 01:53:58,379
Opening ceremonies
have concluded,

1223
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,115
but from the looks on the faces

1224
01:54:00,116 --> 01:54:02,218
of the thousand...

1225
01:54:37,187 --> 01:54:39,722
All three were real.

1226
01:54:41,324 --> 01:54:44,993
Quite special, actually.

1227
01:54:44,995 --> 01:54:49,897
If you approve,
I will move to the next city.

1228
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:52,467
Will there be
any repercussions?

1229
01:54:52,468 --> 01:54:54,902
No one saw them.

1230
01:54:54,905 --> 01:54:58,106
I know what my charge is.

1231
01:54:58,107 --> 01:55:00,008
Convince them.

1232
01:55:00,009 --> 01:55:03,945
This is the most humane
and effective method.

1233
01:55:03,946 --> 01:55:07,981
We're not executioners,
and we don't need martyrs.

1234
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:11,953
If that fails, use the machine.

1235
01:55:11,954 --> 01:55:15,490
And I understand how important
what we're doing is.

1236
01:55:15,491 --> 01:55:18,493
Maintaining balance.

1237
01:55:18,495 --> 01:55:20,864
Keeping order.

1238
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:44,252
We're not here
to buy umbrellas,

1239
01:55:44,254 --> 01:55:45,186
and you know it.

1240
01:55:45,187 --> 01:55:47,155
Spread your wings,
Mr. K.G. Bird.

1241
01:55:47,156 --> 01:55:49,123
We're flying you down
to headquarters.

1242
01:55:49,124 --> 01:55:51,793
On what charge, Boy Wonder?

1243
01:55:51,794 --> 01:55:53,194
Illegal umbrellas.

1244
01:55:53,195 --> 01:55:55,362
Assault and battery,
disturbing the peace.

1245
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:58,566
We've got enough to put you
back on ice, Penguin.

1246
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:08,075
He's too smart.

1247
01:56:08,078 --> 01:56:10,378
That's why he's the mastermind.

1248
01:56:10,379 --> 01:56:13,313
He'll never
tell you his real plan.

1249
01:56:13,316 --> 01:56:14,816
He sets everybody up.

1250
01:56:14,817 --> 01:56:16,517
Gets them looking
in one direction.

1251
01:56:16,518 --> 01:56:18,553
So cool, man.

1252
01:56:18,556 --> 01:56:22,191
There's always a real plan.

1253
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:34,835
You see this camera?

1254
01:56:34,838 --> 01:56:37,472
There are 100 more of these.

1255
01:56:37,473 --> 01:56:40,377
Everything is being recorded.

1256
01:56:49,285 --> 01:56:51,518
<i>All videos
and all backup videos</i>

1257
01:56:51,521 --> 01:56:54,922
- <i>have been erased, correct?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

1258
01:56:54,923 --> 01:56:57,360
Was any of it downloaded
before that?

1259
01:57:05,368 --> 01:57:08,201
I don't know
how this is possible.

1260
01:57:08,204 --> 01:57:11,239
Someone was streaming
the live security feed

1261
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,276
to a private site.

1262
01:57:37,366 --> 01:57:39,499
He went through
the basement tunnels

1263
01:57:39,502 --> 01:57:42,402
to be seen by
as many cameras as possible.

1264
01:57:42,405 --> 01:57:46,374
That's why he didn't go out
the side entrance.

1265
01:57:46,375 --> 01:57:48,176
<i>He was never planning</i>

1266
01:57:48,178 --> 01:57:50,045
<i>on going to that building.</i>

1267
01:57:52,615 --> 01:57:55,118
This was a suicide mission.

1268
01:57:56,386 --> 01:58:00,289
I gave him all the cameras
he needed right here.

1269
01:58:11,267 --> 01:58:15,137
What have you done, Elijah?

1270
01:59:10,994 --> 01:59:12,727
There are unknown forces

1271
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:17,200
that don't want us to realize
what we are truly capable of.

1272
01:59:19,302 --> 01:59:22,270
They don't want us
to know the things we suspect

1273
01:59:22,271 --> 01:59:25,740
are extraordinary
about ourselves are real.

1274
01:59:37,152 --> 01:59:41,455
<i>I believe that if everyone sees
what just a few people become</i>

1275
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:44,625
<i>when they wholly embrace
their gifts,</i>

1276
01:59:44,628 --> 01:59:46,931
<i>others will awaken.</i>

1277
01:59:50,801 --> 01:59:56,571
<i>Belief in oneself
is contagious.</i>

1278
01:59:56,574 --> 02:00:01,075
<i>We give each other permission
to be superheroes.</i>

1279
02:00:01,076 --> 02:00:05,080
<i>We will never awaken
otherwise.</i>

1280
02:00:11,221 --> 02:00:13,554
<i>Whoever these people are</i>

1281
02:00:13,557 --> 02:00:17,191
<i>who don't want us
to know the truth,</i>

1282
02:00:17,192 --> 02:00:21,329
<i>today, they lose.</i>

1283
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:49,424
Thanks.

1284
02:00:57,601 --> 02:01:01,134
How long's it been
since we posted it?

1285
02:01:01,137 --> 02:01:03,373
Two hours.

1286
02:01:08,143 --> 02:01:10,346
How long will it be before...?

1287
02:02:03,298 --> 02:02:05,401
I know what this is.

1288
02:02:08,806 --> 02:02:13,343
This is the moment
we are let in on the universe.
