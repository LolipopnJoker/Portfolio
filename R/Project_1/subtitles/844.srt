1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,130
Life: The great miracle and the great mystery.

2
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,130
Who am I?

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,880
Since the beginning, humans and Pokémon alike

4
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,510
have searched for its meaning.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,970
What am I?

6
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,300
Many strange and wondrous legends evolved from

7
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,840
the pursuit of life's mysteries.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,550
Who am I? Where am I?

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,090
But none is stranger than this tale of the most

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,630
powerful Pokémon of all.

11
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:09,420
I am ready to be.

12
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,760
Where am I?

13
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,470
This is not the same.

14
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,840
Was everything before just a dream?

15
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,800
Why?

16
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,180
Doctor, look at this!

17
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,510
What?

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,130
Its brain waves; they're surging!

19
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,550
Let me see! She's right!

20
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,550
Let's run another scan!

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,010
Its mind is racing!

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,680
Those voices.

23
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,420
I hope we don't lose this one.

24
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,010
They're outside.

25
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,840
We can't lose this one.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Where I must be.

27
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,260
Radio Giovanni's helicopter!

28
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,260
Tell him what's happened!

29
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,130
Quiet! Let us hear its psychic powers.

30
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,920
Psychic powers?

31
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,550
For years we struggled to successfully

32
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,800
clone a Pokémon to prove our theories.

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,760
But you're the first specimen to survive.

34
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,380
That is Mew, the rarest of all Pokémon.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,630
From its DNA we created you:

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,010
Mewtwo.

37
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,880
Mewtwo? Am I only a copy?

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,550
Nothing but Mew's shadow?

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,300
You are greater than Mew.

40
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,630
Improved through the power of human ingenuity.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,760
We used the most advanced techniques to develop

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,840
your awesome psychic powers.

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,090
So I am simply the end result of your experiment.

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,720
What becomes of me now that your experiment is over?

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Oh, our experiment isn't over yet;

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,760
it's just beginning.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
Now the serious testing begins.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,590
These humans... They care nothing for me.

49
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,840
Excellent. We'll start our testing right away.

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,800
Is that my purpose? Am I just an experiment?

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,970
A laboratory specimen? This cannot be my destiny!

52
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,630
We dreamed of creating the

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,470
world's strongest Pokémon...

54
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,550
And we succeeded.

55
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,680
Behold my powers.

56
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,260
I am the strongest Pokémon in the world!

57
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,800
Stronger even than Mew.

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,550
Those fools thought you were a science experiment.

59
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,180
But I- I see you as a valuable partner.

60
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,300
Partner?

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,630
With your psychic powers and my resources,

62
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,920
together we can control the world.

63
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,260
I do not need your help for that, human.

64
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,260
A wildfire destroys everything in its path.

65
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,180
It will be the same with your powers unless you

66
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,760
learn to control them. I can help you do that.

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,760
How?

68
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,630
Trust me, and I'll show you a way to

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,840
focus your powers that will make you invincible.

70
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,840
Show me.

71
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,680
You say this armor protects my body.

72
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,380
But it suppresses my powers.

73
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,300
Your powers are not being suppressed.

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,840
They're being focused.

75
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,760
Learn to use them to accomplish your purpose.

76
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,470
What is that?

77
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,300
Patience, my friend. Your purpose will become clear.

78
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,420
So this is my power.

79
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,840
I am in control now.

80
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,130
NIDOKING, ARCANINE:

81
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,090
NIDOKING, ARCANINE:

82
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,590
But why am I here?

83
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,090
Now I fully perceive my power. But what is my purpose?

84
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,050
To serve your master.

85
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,260
You were created to fight for me.

86
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,180
That is your purpose!

87
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,680
That cannot be. You said we were partners.

88
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,180
We stood as equals!

89
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,130
You were created by humans to obey humans.

90
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
You could never be our equal.

91
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,090
Humans may have created me,

92
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,630
but they will never enslave me.

93
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,800
This cannot be my destiny!

94
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,760
Stop this now!

95
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,760
I was not born a Pokémon; I was created.

96
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,340
And my creators have used and betrayed me!

97
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,010
So I stand alone!

98
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,720
Who am I?

99
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,130
What is my true reason for being?

100
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,220
I will find my own purpose.

101
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,300
And purge this planet of all who oppose me...

102
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,010
Human and Pokémon alike.

103
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,760
The world will heed my warning!

104
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,050
The reign of Mewtwo will soon begin!

105
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,800
Today, Ash, Brock, and Misty are taking a

106
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,800
short break from their Pokémon adventures.

107
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,010
As always, Ash is determined

108
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,760
to become a Pokémon Master.

109
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,260
And, as always, he's ready to endure any hardship,

110
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,090
bear any burden with strength, stamina,

111
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,090
and a will of steel.

112
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,130
Hungry; need food.

113
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,720
Oh Ash, you haven't done a thing all day!

114
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,380
I'm too weak to work, Misty.

115
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,680
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

116
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,130
This lunch is going to be just perfect for you, Ash!

117
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,720
It's my lazy boy no juice stew!

118
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,970
TOGEPI, PIKACHU:

119
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,010
TOGEPI, PIKACHU:

120
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,470
Hey! You there! I'm looking for

121
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,720
a Pokémon Trainer named Ash, from Pallet Town.

122
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,130
You know him?

123
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,550
Yeah, he's me.

124
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,090
Let's have a match!

125
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Unless you're afraid to lose!

126
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,050
Ha! I'm afraid you're going to lose this one!

127
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,680
Ash, you just said you were too weak to work!

128
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,220
That's right, I am too weak to work.

129
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
But a Pokémon battle isn't work!

130
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,840
That's progress. At least his mouth is working.

131
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:46,220
I want to be the very best. Like no one ever was.

132
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:53,050
To catch them is my real test. To train them is my cause.

133
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,220
I will travel across the land, searching far and wide.

134
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,760
Each Pokémon to understand the

135
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,090
power that's inside.

136
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,300
That's inside. Pokémon.

137
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,920
It's you and me.

138
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,010
I know it's my destiny. Pokémon.

139
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,760
Oh you're my best friend,

140
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,260
in a world we must defend. Pokémon.

141
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,970
A heart so true. Our courage will pull us through.

142
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,130
You teach me and I'll teach you

143
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:41,380
Gotta catch 'em. Gotta catch 'em. Gotta catch 'em all.

144
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,180
Great job, Bulbasaur! You did it!

145
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,800
Every challenge along the way; With courage I will face.

146
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,470
I will battle every day to claim my rightful place.

147
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:08,090
Come with me; the time is right. There's no better team.

148
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,300
Arm in arm we'll win the fight.

149
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,220
It's always been our dream.

150
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,630
It's always been our dream.

151
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,800
Pokémon!

152
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,470
It's you and me. I know it's my destiny. Pokémon!

153
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,180
Oh you're my best friend; in a world we must defend.

154
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,050
Pokémon!

155
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,260
A heart so true. Our courage will pull us through.

156
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,050
You teach me, and I'll teach you. Po-ké-mon!

157
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,220
Gotta catch 'em - Gotta catch 'em - Gotta catch 'em all!

158
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,550
Pokémon!

159
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,090
Oh no!

160
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,880
We did it!

161
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,840
Well, that sure was a shocking ending.

162
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,720
Shocking that Ash moves so fast.

163
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,380
There's another credit on Pikachu's charge account.

164
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,880
We've got to grab it!

165
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,220
I know we've got to grab some rare Pokémon

166
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,550
for the Boss. But it wouldn't be such a bad idea

167
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,090
if we grabbed a little bite to eat, would it?

168
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,800
We didn't come here to steal a meal.

169
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,630
I'd settle for a taste of that Pika-chow.

170
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,920
TOGEPI, PIKACHU, SQUIRTLE, BULBASAUR:

171
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,180
I'm starving.

172
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,760
I can cook something.

173
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,090
Thanks, but the last time you cooked,

174
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,590
you wiped out 8 of my 9 lives.

175
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,470
Master, shall I extend an invitation to

176
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,720
these Trainers as well?

177
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,550
As you wish.

178
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,220
PIKACHU, TOGEPI, SQUIRTLE, BULBASAUR:

179
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,880
Hey, watch where you're flying!

180
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,630
Huh? Something for me?

181
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,590
Wow!

182
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,220
Greetings, Pokémon Trainers. I bear an invitation.

183
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,180
She's really small, but really pretty!

184
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,630
You have been chosen to join a select group of

185
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,380
Pokémon Trainers at a special gathering

186
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,680
It will be hosted by my master, the world's greatest

187
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,550
Pokémon Trainer, at his palace on New Island.

188
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,090
A chartered ferry will leave from

189
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,380
Old Shore Wharf to take you to the island this

190
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,840
afternoon. Only Trainers who present this

191
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,970
invitation will be admitted.

192
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,550
If you decide to attend, you must reply at once.

193
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
My master awaits you.

194
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,260
Uhh, is there a rewind button?

195
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:43,970
Should we go?

196
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,800
Of course we should! I've got to meet her!

197
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,550
I guess the world's number one Trainer wants to

198
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,590
challenge me to a match!

199
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,680
Well, we've got to let him know right away!

200
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,970
I'm saying yes!

201
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,840
We want to know what's so special about the

202
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,050
Twerp trio's special delivery!

203
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,470
Hey, look!

204
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,010
Yes? To what?

205
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,880
Chill out Raticate!

206
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,470
Kingler! Save your energy will ya!?

207
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,800
This is going to be so cool!

208
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,300
Officer Jenny please report to the Ferry entrance.

209
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,510
Officer Jenny to the Ferry entrance please.

210
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,340
Togepi's totally soaked!

211
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,840
I can't believe how fast the storm came up!

212
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:31,590
What? The ferry is canceled?

213
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,420
But I've got to get to New Island!

214
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,220
Yeah! So do I! What's the big deal?

215
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,880
It's more than just rain! The harbor manager

216
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,130
thinks this could be the worst storm ever!

217
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,970
Listen to me! The prophets have predicted

218
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,420
the return of the winds of water.

219
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,880
For years I have prayed that mankind would

220
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,050
never witness that deadly storm ever again.

221
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,420
Isn't that just a legend?

222
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,590
The ancient writings tell of the storm wiping out

223
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,800
all but a few Pokémon.

224
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,260
And their sorrow, the water of their tears, somehow

225
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,720
restored the lives lost in the storm.

226
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,010
But there are no Pokémon tears today.

227
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,010
Just waters which no one can survive.

228
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,420
And that's why your ferry to New Island

229
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,220
has been canceled.

230
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,720
Well, I'm going to New Island anyway!

231
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,800
All my Pokémon are Water type!

232
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,300
We'll just swim over to that palace!

233
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,630
I warn you! The waves will be savage!

234
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,010
You will never make it!

235
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,090
And besides, if you tried that stunt and your

236
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,220
Pokémon got hurt, you'd be out of luck

237
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,470
because we had to close down the Pokémon Center!

238
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,840
How come?

239
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,300
Because the nurse in charge of the Center

240
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,050
disappeared last month!

241
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,050
And if any of you see her, please contact me

242
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,510
at once!

243
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,630
That's a picture of her over there on the wall.

244
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,510
She's cute!

245
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,470
She sure looks familiar.

246
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,680
Come back here, or I'll place you under arrest!

247
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,090
Come back!

248
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,300
Some Trainers have no fear.

249
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,680
To them, this is just one more challenge.

250
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,920
They follow their hearts. That is what

251
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,590
sets them apart and will make them Pokémon Masters.

252
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,260
Good luck to all of you!

253
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,920
The world's greatest Pokémon Master

254
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,180
is waiting for me!

255
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,130
Let's use our Pokémon to get to that island!

256
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,090
Ash, our Pokémon aren't strong enough.

257
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,920
They can't handle giant waves like this!

258
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,260
Guess you're right.

259
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,840
You want to cross maybe?

260
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,090
We take you yeah?

261
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,470
We Vikings are used to big wave.

262
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,050
We get you to New Island faster than

263
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,510
you can say fahrvergnugen.

264
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:17,380
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!

265
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,720
I think I'm going to have one!

266
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,920
I didn't know Vikings still existed.

267
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,300
They mostly live in Minnesota!

268
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Something's not right! Are you sure this boat is safe?

269
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't worry, this ship won't let you down!

270
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,180
We always sail into rough weather! Don't get upset!

271
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,800
Tell my stomach!

272
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,180
Heave! Ho!

273
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,340
It's all right, Togepi! We're going to be okay!

274
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:49,010
Heave! Ho!

275
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,760
Those aren't Vikings!

276
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,970
It's Team Rocket!

277
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,720
I should have known there was something fishy

278
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,180
about them besides the way they smell!

279
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,590
Ha! Prepare for trouble!

280
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,920
Make it double!

281
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,760
Forget the motto, we're gonna have a wipeout!

282
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,420
Ash! Misty!

283
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,090
Have you seen Ash and Pikachu?!

284
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,470
Not yet!

285
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,590
Stay together. It's our only hope!

286
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,760
Hey look!

287
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,680
SQUIRTLE, MISTY, BROCK:

288
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,010
My master bids you welcome to New Island.

289
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,300
Will you kindly present your invitation?

290
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,180
Uhh, here it is, miss!

291
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,240
The bearers of this invitation may be

292
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,080
admitted to New Island.

293
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,780
I knew I recognized that face!

294
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,280
What?

295
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,950
Aren't you the nurse who's missing

296
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,820
from the treatment center?

297
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
You do look just like her.

298
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,660
I fear you are mistaken. I have always

299
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
dwelt on this island and have always been

300
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,200
in the service of my master.

301
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,990
Please come this way.

302
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,530
My master awaits your arrival.

303
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,490
Now that you are here, all Trainers worthy

304
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,410
of an audience with my master are present.

305
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,700
There's only three of them.

306
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,240
Aren't we going to wait for the others?

307
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,120
Only the Trainers capable of braving this

308
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,450
storm have proven themselves worthy

309
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,700
in my master's eyes.

310
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,910
Do you mean that storm was some kind of test?

311
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,240
Please release your Pokémon from their

312
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,450
Poké Balls and join the others.

313
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,780
It will not be long before my master's

314
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,530
intentions are clear.

315
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,370
Locked out! Now we'll never know what kind of party

316
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,490
we're missing!

317
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,620
Then we'll just have to crash that party!

318
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,660
You know another way in?

319
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,580
Look over there!

320
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,240
Ahh! But Jessie! How are we going to

321
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
swim up that thing?!

322
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,660
Pretend you're a catfish!

323
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,450
Something wrong, Jessie?

324
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,120
No. Come on. Let's get going.

325
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,820
I think this plan's all wet.

326
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,280
What took you guys so long?

327
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,990
How'd you get here?

328
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,030
I decided to fly over. It was easy!

329
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,280
Hurricane winds are a breeze for Pidgeot here!

330
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,240
Hey guys! Say hello!

331
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,030
Those are my Pokémon!

332
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,490
It was no problem getting through that storm!

333
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,120
I rode over on Gyarados' back!

334
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,240
Wow! I heard it takes a lot of skill to train Gyarados!

335
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,160
Yeah but once you train it, it's the most

336
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,450
dependable Pokémon there is!

337
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,160
You haven't met my Pokémon! Over there!

338
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,030
You are about to meet my master.

339
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,580
The time has come for your encounter

340
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,950
with the greatest Pokémon Master on Earth!

341
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,740
What's that?

342
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,120
Yes, the world's greatest Pokémon Master

343
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,820
is also the most powerful Pokémon on Earth.

344
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,410
This is the ruler of New Island...

345
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,780
And soon the whole world!

346
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,030
Mewtwo!

347
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,200
Mewtwo?!

348
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,990
A Pokémon can't be a Pokémon Master! No way!

349
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,990
Quiet, human! From now on,

350
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,280
I am the one who makes the rules.

351
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,120
How is it talking?

352
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,030
It's psychic!

353
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,780
ASH, BROCK, AND MISTY'S POKEMON:

354
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,780
We'll show you! Let's go, Gyarados!

355
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,200
Gyarados, Hyper Beam attack!

356
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,740
PIKACHU, TOGEPI:

357
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,780
Gyarados!

358
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,030
Child's play.

359
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,620
Your usefulness has ended.

360
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,870
Nurse Joy!

361
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,740
Where am I? And how in the world did I get here?

362
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,120
You have been under my control.

363
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,030
I transported you here from the Pokémon Center.

364
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,160
Your knowledge of Pokémon physiology

365
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,490
proved useful for my plan.

366
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,370
And now I've cleansed your tiny human brain

367
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,200
of memories from the past few weeks.

368
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,660
Who are you?!

369
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,870
I am the new ruler of this world...

370
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,080
The master of humans and Pokémon alike.

371
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,040
You're just a bully!

372
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,450
Look at these!

373
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,410
They're Pokémon.

374
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,830
Are they real?

375
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,200
I was hoping there'd be a party.

376
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,740
This is the Pokémon replication system.

377
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
System activated.

378
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,910
Pokémon based on genetic analysis.

379
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,580
Pokémon DNA sampling sequence: Now in progress.

380
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,910
Put me down! Let go!

381
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,580
Help!

382
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,580
Meowth!

383
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,580
Grab him!

384
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,580
Help me!

385
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,660
I made it! But just by a hair!

386
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,040
Look! There's your hair!

387
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,240
Analyzing Pokémon biomaterial sample...

388
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,870
Analysis complete. Pokémon identified.

389
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,660
Begin replication sequence.

390
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,870
Who's that Pokémon?!

391
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,240
It's Meowth!

392
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,700
Meowth!

393
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,500
But I'm Meowth!

394
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,120
So is the one in the tank!

395
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,950
That's your clone!

396
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,540
I haven't got much time!

397
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,540
I pray this record of our experiment survives!

398
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,540
A year ago, we discovered a fossil that proved to be

399
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,160
the remains of the ancient Pokémon Mew.

400
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,500
There was sufficient genetic

401
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,620
material to replicate Mew.

402
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,290
But Giovanni, who funded our project, insisted we try to

403
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,290
design superclones who were more powerful

404
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,330
than any living Pokémon.

405
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,160
Plenty attempts failed, but finally our experiments

406
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,870
proved successful.

407
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,700
We produced a living Pokémon! We called it Mewtwo!

408
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,870
But for some reason,

409
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,870
the creature's anger is out of control.

410
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,370
With its psychic powers, it is destroying

411
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,080
our laboratory.

412
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,200
We dreamed of creating the world's strongest Pokémon...

413
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,870
And we succeeded!

414
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,500
Sounds like a real Pokén-stein.

415
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,830
Sure does!

416
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,450
One big cat!

417
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,620
So this must be the lab.

418
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,580
But if Mewtwo destroyed it...

419
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Somebody rebuilt it!

420
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,910
Yes... but who?

421
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,700
You humans are a dangerous species!

422
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,000
You brought me into your world with

423
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,240
no purpose but to be your slave.

424
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
But now I have my own purpose.

425
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,700
My storm will create my own world...

426
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,660
by destroying yours!

427
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,540
So you hate all humans?!

428
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,450
And you're going to destroy us to save Pokémon?!

429
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,200
No. Your Pokémon will not be spared.

430
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,830
They have disgraced themselves by serving humans.

431
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,620
Those Pokémon are nothing but slaves!

432
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,740
So you say I am wrong?

433
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,620
That you are not this human's servant?

434
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,080
You are his friend?

435
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,580
You are as pathetic as the rest!

436
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,240
Pikachu!

437
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,040
Humans and Pokémon can never be friends!

438
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,790
Ash! Are you okay?

439
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,330
Don't pick on Pikachu!

440
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,450
If you are a Pokémon,

441
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,740
there is no reason I can't capture you!

442
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,080
Go, Rhyhorn!

443
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,700
No! Rhyhorn!

444
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,200
Fools! Your Pokémon attacks cannot weaken me.

445
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,660
My powers are too great!

446
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,830
No Trainer can conquer me!

447
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,290
Then you wont mind proving it in a real match!

448
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,950
Is that a challenge?!

449
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,000
You bet it is!

450
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,830
They're awake!

451
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,870
I'm scared!

452
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,790
Me too!

453
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,540
Meowth!

454
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,000
Like most Pokémon Trainers,

455
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,500
I too began with Charmander, Squirtle,

456
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,700
and Bulbasaur. But for their evolved forms,

457
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,790
I used their genetic material to

458
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,080
clone even more powerful copies.

459
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,330
Copies?!

460
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,330
They're clones!

461
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,950
A stadium!

462
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,370
Mewtwo planned this all along!

463
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,080
Your fake Venusaur can't beat my real one.

464
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,120
Right, Bruteroot?

465
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,450
We'll blow away that Blastoise!

466
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,790
Won't we, Shellshocker?!

467
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,040
It may not have a nickname but I do have...

468
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,000
Charizard. I choose you!

469
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,080
Charizard! I didn't say start!

470
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,080
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

471
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,080
Which of you will oppose me first?

472
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,870
I underestimated you last time,

473
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,830
but that won't happen again!

474
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,240
Go, Bruteroot! Razor Leaf!

475
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,620
Vine Whip.

476
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,200
Bruteroot!

477
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,620
It looks like I'm up! Go, Shellshocker!

478
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,790
Shellshocker! Hydro Pump!

479
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,740
Shellshocker!

480
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,500
You better forfeit, Ash! Those clones are too powerful!

481
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,790
I'm not giving up!

482
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,500
Charizard! Use your speed, not power, and you'll win!

483
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,580
All right, go!

484
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,950
Can't Charizard move any quicker?!

485
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,200
The clone is too fast!

486
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,120
Charizard's in trouble!

487
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,410
Finish it!

488
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,580
No, Charizard! No! Are you okay?

489
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,240
As the victor, I now claim my prize!

490
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,200
Your Pokémon!

491
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,540
Hey wait!

492
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,740
What are you going to do with those Pokémon?!

493
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,790
I will extract their DNA to make clones for myself.

494
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,120
They will remain safe on this island with me

495
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,500
while my storm destroys the planet!

496
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,290
You can't do this!

497
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,290
Yeah, Mewtwo! We won't let you!

498
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:11,290
Do not attempt to defy me!

499
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,200
This is my world now!

500
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,870
Uh oh!

501
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,540
Let's go!

502
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,410
Gyarados!

503
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,620
Hey, I know! Mewtwo can't capture them if

504
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,910
they're already inside their Poké Balls!

505
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,450
Bulbasaur! Squirtle! Return!

506
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,240
SQUIRTLE, BULBASAUR:

507
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,620
It is no use!

508
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,830
It is futile to try and escape my power!

509
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,620
Brock: Never mind the Pokeballs carry them away!

510
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,160
Give back my Psyduck!

511
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,540
Vulpix!

512
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,370
Run, Pikachu!

513
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,240
Pikachu!

514
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,790
Keep running, Pikachu!

515
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,870
Pikachu!

516
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,620
Hey!

517
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,000
You're not going to get Pikachu!

518
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,910
There goes Alakazam!

519
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,910
Dewgong!

520
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,620
Vileplume!

521
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,290
Sandshrew! Nidoqueen! Vaporeon!

522
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,910
But me, I got a special place in my tail for this one.

523
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,500
Look there!

524
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,500
I don't have time for your dumb motto today!

525
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:09,330
Who's that Pokémon?!

526
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,790
It's Pikachu!

527
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,870
Let go! Stupid machine!

528
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:18,450
Give me back my Pikachu!

529
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,160
What's happening?

530
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,370
Pikachu!

531
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,370
I'm so glad you're okay!

532
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,950
The copies are hatching!

533
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,450
They're fabulous things!

534
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,580
Send in the clones!

535
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,500
But where are the real ones?

536
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,160
I wonder if they feel...

537
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,410
Clonesome!

538
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,000
The Poké-originals!

539
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,000
Squirtle's back!

540
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,290
SQUIRTLE, PIKACHU:

541
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,950
You're all okay!

542
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,540
Humans, you have served my purpose.

543
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,200
I am sparing your lives... for the moment.

544
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,120
But you cannot escape your fate.

545
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,000
The hour of my vengeance draws near!

546
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,450
Behold!

547
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,370
With Pokémon and humans eliminated,

548
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,740
the clones shall inherit the world!

549
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,870
You can't do this! I won't let you!

550
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,740
It's Ash!

551
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:16,080
All right!

552
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,120
Psyduck!

553
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,040
Vulpix!

554
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,540
It is useless to challenge me!

555
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,330
It's not going to end like this, Mewtwo! We won't let it!

556
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,950
You're mine!

557
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,460
Ash, no!

558
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,420
Look out!

559
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,630
What?

560
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,710
Can it be?

561
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,920
What is that?

562
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,840
I don't know.

563
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,920
Mew! So, finally, we meet.

564
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,300
Mew?!

565
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,670
I may have been cloned from your DNA...

566
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,750
But now I will prove that Mewtwo

567
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,540
is better than the original.

568
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,670
Superior to Mew!

569
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,170
Mew and Mewtwo!

570
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,840
So Mewtwo was cloned from Mew!

571
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:05,040
This world is too small for two of us!

572
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,750
Whoa!

573
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,540
Why do you flee from me? Are you afraid to find out

574
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,250
which of us is greater?!

575
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,460
PIKACHU, SQUIRTLE, BULBASAUR:

576
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,460
So you do have some fight in you!

577
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,840
But I have no time for games. Destiny is at hand!

578
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,960
Who will rule? My super Pokémon? Or your pathetic

579
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,130
group of spineless, inferior Pokémon?

580
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,000
We were created with powers

581
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,800
far stronger than the originals.

582
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,840
Mew's got a good point!

583
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,040
What's it saying?

584
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,590
Mew says you don't prove anything by showing off

585
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,960
a lot of special powers.

586
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,460
And that a Pokémon's real

587
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,130
strength comes from the heart!

588
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,500
My clones don't need their powers to

589
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,670
prove their worth!

590
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,670
I will block all the Pokémon's special abilities

591
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,380
using my psychic powers!

592
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,210
Now we shall see who triumphs!

593
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,460
Go!

594
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:31,250
Brother my brother.

595
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,000
Tell me what are we fighting for.

596
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,380
We've got to end this war.

597
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,210
We should love one another.

598
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,130
Oh can't we just pretend this war never began.

599
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:50,630
We can try,

600
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,090
brother my brother.

601
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,170
We face each other from different sides.

602
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,630
The anger burns; can't remember why.

603
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,590
It's kind of crazy to cause such pain.

604
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,960
Our foolish pride makes us hate this way.

605
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,880
We watch our world fall apart .

606
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,460
Tell me what good is winning when you

607
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,210
lose your heart.

608
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:34,250
Brother my brother.

609
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,250
Tell me what are we fighting for.

610
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,590
Isn't life worth so much more?

611
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,090
We should love one another.

612
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:49,340
Oh can't we just pretend this war never began?

613
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,420
Tell me why.

614
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,670
Brother my brother.

615
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:03,090
Yes we can try.

616
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,960
Brother my brother.

617
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:41,540
Pokémon aren't meant to fight. Not like this.

618
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,170
It's useless!

619
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,380
What can come out of it?

620
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,500
Nothing but pain!

621
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,460
Why can't Mewtwo understand it's not right to

622
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,840
force Pokémon to battle this way?!

623
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,300
They're all living creatures!

624
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,880
This just proves that fighting is wrong!

625
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,380
I was prepared for trouble. But not for this!

626
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,920
Make that double, for me!

627
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,500
Now I can see how horrible fighting really is!

628
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,090
Even the best of friends will fight sometimes!

629
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,920
I'll promise never to fight again if you will!

630
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,420
Jessie! / James!

631
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,460
What am I doing?

632
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,840
Let's get something straight, copycat!

633
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,090
You-owth ain't gonna push Meowth around!

634
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,750
You mean we don't have to fight with each other?

635
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,540
But how can I trust you? You was born different.

636
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,540
I almost made a clawful mistake!

637
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,000
But how do I know you're

638
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,920
not going to pull a fast one on me?

639
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:01,130
You're right! We do have a lot in common!

640
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:05,250
The same Earth, the same air, the same sky!

641
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,840
Maybe if we started looking at what's the same,

642
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,210
instead of always looking at what's different...

643
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,420
Well, who knows?

644
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,460
Pikachu!

645
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,670
Pikachu!

646
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,920
Quit it! Please stop!

647
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Ash!

648
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,000
Are you okay?

649
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,960
We've got to stop this!

650
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,000
But how? All Mewtwo cares about is

651
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,880
proving how strong those superclones are!

652
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,340
I'd rather risk my life out in Mewtwo's storm

653
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,750
than watch these Pokémon destroy each other.

654
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,960
Me too!

655
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,500
I wish there was some way to stop them!

656
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,130
I don't know what to do!

657
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,800
I don't think they'll ever stop!

658
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,540
Those Pokémon look like

659
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,130
they're ready to fight to the death!

660
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,540
That's a fight that nobody is going to win.

661
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:23,040
Someone's got to take a stand.

662
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:25,130
Someone's got to say no

663
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:29,920
and refuse to fight. Just like Pikachu!

664
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,000
Ash, wait!

665
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:36,540
You've got to stop right now!

666
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,500
Stop!

667
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,000
Ash!

668
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,000
Oh no!

669
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:56,710
Fool! Trying to stop our battle!

670
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,630
Please no...

671
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:45,960
Pikachu!

672
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,880
A human sacrificed himself to save the Pokémon.

673
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,340
I pitted them against each other.

674
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,880
But not until they set aside

675
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,300
their differences did I see the

676
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:28,040
true power they all shared deep inside.

677
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,920
I see now that the circumstances

678
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,460
of one's birth are irrelevant.

679
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,880
It is what you do with the gift of life

680
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,340
that determines who you are.

681
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:01,880
VULPIX, PSYDUCK:

682
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:19,460
Mewtwo, where are you going?

683
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,920
Where my heart can learn

684
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,460
what yours knows so well.

685
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,170
What transpired here I will always remember.

686
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:32,130
But perhaps for you, these events are best forgotten.

687
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,800
This could be the worst storm ever!

688
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,000
You must listen to me. You have got to find shelter.

689
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:05,340
Excuse me please! The Pokémon Treatment Center

690
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,920
will be open as a shelter!

691
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,880
Anyone who needs a place to stay

692
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,130
should come with me!

693
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:19,090
Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny are really great!

694
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,880
They just keep getting more beautiful every time

695
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,380
I see 'em.

696
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,840
Hey guys! How did we wind up in this place anyway?

697
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,710
Well I guess we're just here because we're here.

698
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,590
TOGEPI, PIKACHU:

699
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:32,090
Yeah! Let's eat!

700
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,090
A huh!

701
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,300
Look! It's a miracle!

702
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,540
I can't believe it!

703
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,340
The storm disappeared!

704
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,800
That's so weird!

705
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,040
It's good to have things clear again!

706
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,090
Hey! What's that?

707
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,460
What's what?

708
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,920
I don't see anything, Ash.

709
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,380
Except the sky!

710
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,380
The day I left home to start my Pokémon journey,

711
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,920
I saw a really rare Pokémon. And just now,

712
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,340
I thought I saw another one!

713
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,960
Well, maybe you're just seeing things, Ash!

714
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,920
Well, maybe he's not!

715
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,380
Well, maybe we'll see.

716
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,340
Many strange legends surround

717
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,250
the mysteries of Pokémon.

718
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,170
And just as many adventures await our

719
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,090
young heroes as they continue on their quest.

720
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,840
For Ash and his friends,

721
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,000
the journey's just begun.

722
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,300
I don't have a clue how we got here, but who cares.

723
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:02,420
This is paradise!

724
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,090
For once a happy ending!

725
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:08,170
Team Rocket signing off again!

726
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:11,710
Do you have any sunscreen?

727
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,090
You know, I'd really like to go sailing in

728
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,380
one of them catamarans! Ha ha!

729
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:33,880
Here we are,

730
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:38,170
Safe at last.

731
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:41,380
We can breathe a sigh.

732
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:46,090
It seems the storm has passed.

733
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,090
Through it all

734
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:54,500
No one knew

735
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:58,630
that all the tears in heaven

736
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:02,170
would bring me back to you.

737
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:06,040
No one I know

738
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:10,000
Imagined we would make it.

739
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:12,880
But it only made us glad

740
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:18,840
we both believed.

741
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:23,040
You and me we're a miracle.

742
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,380
Meant to be and

743
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,250
nothing can change it.

744
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:30,670
Mountains move and oceans part

745
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,040
when they are

746
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:35,250
standing in our way.

747
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:39,590
You and me we're a miracle.

748
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,840
Angels stand watching over us

749
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:49,670
and heaven shines upon us every day.

750
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,960
Rock, rock and Roll!

751
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,590
Rock and Roll!

752
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,540
Free up your mind.

753
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,590
Let the music free up your mind.

754
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,340
And it will help you to find.

755
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,380
Let the music help you to find.

756
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,250
The beats will give you a sign.

757
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:29,380
Let the music free up your mind.

758
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,380
Free up your mind.

759
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:35,590
Let the music free

760
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,300
up your mind.

761
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,340
Let the music help

762
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,380
you to find.

763
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,130
Let the music

764
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:48,500
free up your mind.

765
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:51,750
Free up your mind.

766
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,340
If only tears could bring

767
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:57,380
you back to me.

768
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,590
If only love could

769
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,460
find a way.

770
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,750
What I would do what I

771
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,920
would give if you

772
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,210
returned to me someday

773
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,040
somehow, someway.

774
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,340
If my tears could

775
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:27,960
bring you back to me.

776
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,590
Love will find a way

777
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:49,040
Don't say you love me. You don't even know me.

778
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:53,170
If you really want me, then give me some time.

779
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:56,670
Don't go there baby.

780
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,460
Not before I'm ready.

781
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,090
Don't say your heart's in a hurry.

782
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,500
It's not like we're going to get married.

783
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:09,710
Give me, give me, some time.
