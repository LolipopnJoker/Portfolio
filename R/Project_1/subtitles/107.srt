00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:10,373
# <i>Into life today</i>

3
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:14,280
# <i>Someone who loved me</i>
<i>much as I love her</i> #

4
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:17,513
# <i>There have been trials</i>

5
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,146
# <i>And not just a few</i> #

6
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:22,314
# <i>But we made it through</i> #

7
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:25,626
# <i>And now the times are here</i> #

8
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:29,265
# <i>We're gonna get married</i> #

9
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:31,558
# <i>Have everything</i> #

10
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:35,766
# <i>But the sun</i> #

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,903
# <i>And the rain</i> #

12
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,808
# <i>We're a</i>
<i>definite combination</i> #

13
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,102
# <i>We're gonna get married</i> #

14
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:45,645
# <i>We're gonna get married</i> #

00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:48,513
# <i>We're gonna get married</i> #

16
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,149
# <i>We're gonna get married</i> #

17
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,155

[grunting]

19
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,127
You must do something!
Baby is coming!

20
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,391
Yeah. I know baby is coming!

21
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,933
Miss, you've to stay calm
and take deep breaths, okay?

22
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,969
Myra, I need a doctor here
right now.

23
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,298
I am working on it.

24
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,633
You're not a doctor?

25
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:10,730
No, I am a nurse.

26
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,468
You are man
and you are nurse?

27
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,373
What kind of man is nurse?

28
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:16,639
Look, folks,
I'm a professional, okay?

29
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:18,738
I know exactly what I'm doing,
so just trust me,

30
00:01:18,815 --> 00:01:20,680
everything's going to be fine,
all right?

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,808
Okay.
Yeah.

32
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:23,317
Yeah. You're fully dilated.

33
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:25,479
Hey, I need that doctor
right now.

34
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:26,920
There are no free doctors.

35
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,220
Nurse, you're gonna have
to deliver that baby yourself.

36
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,453
I can see the head!

37
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:33,552
Holy shit!

38
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:35,895
[screaming]

39
00:01:40,703 --> 00:01:42,193
Check it out.

40
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:43,364
We did it.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,998
We had a boy.

42
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,408
A boy. You are my hero.

43
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,571
Mmm-hmm.

44
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,239
I name baby for you.

45
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:54,180
Oh! You don't have to do that.

46
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:56,648
Yeah. I must.
It is Latvian tradition.

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,516
We'll name the baby...

48
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:01,681

49
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,791

<i>Hello, </i>
<i>you've reached the Fockers. </i>

50
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:14,803
<i>We're not around, </i>

<i>Goodbye. </i>

51
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,567
<i>Roz, how the hell</i>
<i>do you shut this thing off? </i>

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,665
<i>(Roz on machine)</i>
<i>I have no idea. </i>
<i>Just press a button. </i>

53
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:21,573
<i>(Bernie)</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure it's off. </i>

54
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:23,077
<i>Honey, </i>
<i>you want a chimichanga? </i>

55
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:24,909
<i>(Roz)</i>
<i>I thought they gave you gas. </i>

56
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:26,710
<i>A little bit, </i>
<i>but it's worth it. </i>

57
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:29,047
<i>Worth it for you, </i>
<i>but I'm the one</i>
<i>that gets the fumes. </i>

58
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,881
<i>Honey, I'm in the mood</i>

59

[beeping]

61
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,281
Hi, guys, it's me.

62
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:35,722
Dad, I told you
six months ago

63
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,384
you have to change
that message.

64
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,155
Anyway, I'm just calling
to double check

65
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,661
'cause I didn't hear
back from you.

66
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,221
You know that
Pam and I are flying out
to Oyster Bay today.

67
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,824
And, then, we're flying
to Miami tomorrow
with the Byrneses.

68
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:47,164
And our flight gets in 7:30,

69
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:48,999
so we should be
at the house around 9:00.

70
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:51,006
So just give me a call
back on my cell, okay?

71
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,632
'Cause I want to go over
a few things

72
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,904
about Pam's dad and just, uh,

73
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:56,672
just some other stuff
for the weekend.

74
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:58,543
All right. I love you, bye.
Hey!

75
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,514
Hey, sweetie.
How was your shift?

76
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,982
Oh! Guess what?
What?

77
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:03,951
I delivered my first baby.

78
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,078
[gasps]
No way.

79
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:06,143
Mmm. Yeah.

80
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:07,450
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you.

81
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:08,922
It was incredible.
I mean, just...

82
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:10,686
Just to be pulling
this life force

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,250
out of this woman's...

84
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,796
You know, I mean,
it was just so... It was...

85
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:17,799
The whole baby thing is...
It's so cool.

86
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,664
That's great, honey.
That's great.

87
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:22,330
So, uh, are you ready to go?
I want to get
to the airport early.

88
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,599
I know.
Just give me a second.

89
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:25,334
You know how things
always goes wrong.

90
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:26,705
The flight leaves
in four hours.

91
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:28,175
I wish we could set
a wedding date

92
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,144
without our parents
actually having to meet.

93
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,840
Honey, this weekend
is gonna be fine.

94
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:33,575
And your parents are great.

95
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:35,276
Oh, they're great
in small doses.

96
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,911
Well, 48 hours
in Coconut Grove
is a small dose.

97
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:40,012
Besides, you've already
won over my dad,

98
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,522
and that is the hard part.

99
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,990
Mmm. That is true.

100
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:45,994
I mean, I am still
in the Byrnes family
circle of trust, right?

101
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:47,256
You're firmly in the circle.

102
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,319
[chuckling]

103
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:49,956
Finally.

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,394

110
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:04,972

What?

128
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,291
Well, they overbooked coach.

[sighing]

130
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,398
So what does that mean?

131
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,666
Do we miss our flight or...

132
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:07,641
Well, we are gonna have to
upgrade you to first class.

133
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,836
Really?

134
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,438

Oh! Sir, why don't you
let me take that for you?

138
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,217
Okay, yeah.

139
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:23,822
So, uh, you wanna check it
or put it on another flight

140
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,793
'cause that's cool,
whatever you want to do.

141
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:28,592
I'm just gonna store it
in the Captain's closet.

142
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,325
That was nice.

143
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,492
Yeah.

No. Thanks.

No?

155
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:58,252
[whispering]
It's a scam.

156
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,295
That's how they
make all their money.

157
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,354
That's true.
You don't need it.

158
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,824

Well, almost,

168
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:37,695
but you have to do it
with two fingers.

169
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,758
One on each eye like this:

170

Guess who's here?

174

It's Prof. Einstein.

Hi, Little Jack.

176
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,172

Hey. Hey. This is Greg.

we talked about him?

Hey.

off the old block, huh?

207

We might have another CIA man
on our hands here.

208

I'd be discreet
about my profession, Greg,
if I were you.

You know what I mean?

210
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:04,514
As far as
your parents are concerned,
I'm still a horticulturist.

Hey, why is Little Jack here?

212
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,353
Are Deb and Bob house-sitting,
while we're in Florida?

213

No, they're in Ko Saimii,

Well, at this age, Greg,
his mind is like a sponge.

Look, when he reaches
your age, for example,

241
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,824

far less capable

uncertain times, Greg,

really rather not.

going to be in this together?

I like that thing.
Hey, do you mind if l, uh,

364
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:24,869
make a little announcement?

365
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,066
Well...

366
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,905
Only the captain gets
to make an announcement.

367
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:31,936
You want to honk the horn?

368
00:13:32,014 --> 00:13:33,845
Um... Sure.

369
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,184

Oh, she wants you
to honk the horn.

381
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,406
Not interested.

She honks, you honk.

383
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:11,578

Come on, Jack. Come on.
Give her a honk.

What're you saying?

406
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,558
Now, wait a minute.
What does this mean?

407
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,227
I know what this means.

408
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,601
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Oh, poop!

409
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:05,503
You got to poop, right?
Okay, good.

410
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:06,632
Thank you for warning me.

Everybody poops.
Sometimes it hurts.

412
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,478
It's okay.
Just let it come out.

Nothing. He...
I think he has to poop.

416
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:17,145
That's not the sign for poop.

417
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:18,584
That's the sign for milk.

418
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:20,144
This is the sign for poop.

419
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:21,951
Oh! What's the sign
for sour milk?

420
00:15:22,024 --> 00:15:23,616
'Cause, uh
this tastes a little funky.

421
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,092
That's because
it's from Debbie's

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,890
Fortunately,
she pumped for a week

426
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:34,731

enough for the trip.

00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,135
Okay,

(Greg)
What are you doing there?

429
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,000
Well, during
the breastfeeding stage, Greg,

430
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,941
infants can get
very confused and upset

431
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,876
when they're separated
from their mothers.

432
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:46,505
So I invented something

433
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:49,210
to ease LJ's anxiety
during chow time.

434
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,617
I call it the Mannary Gland.

435
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,822
I had it made
from an exact cast

436
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,222
of Debbie's left bosom.

437
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,521

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,394
Oh, yeah. Okay.

439
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,863
It's been so effective,

440
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:06,230
I'm thinking of
getting it patented.

441
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:07,958
Would you like to touch it?

442
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:09,264
Uh, I wouldn't.

443
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,737
Oh, come on,
feel how soft it is.

444
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:12,706
I can... I can see
how soft it is from here.

445
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:13,798
No, feel it, Greg.

446
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,275
It's very...
It looks very...

447
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,107
Just feel the breast, Greg.

448
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:20,805
Just a...

449
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:22,874
Oh, watch the nipple.

actually feel like.

Honey, you promised

460
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,871
you wouldn't take the boob out
in front of company.

461
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,471
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

462
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,141
Breast-feeding is
perfectly natural.

463

Dad, that's not natural,
that's just weird.

any more tonight.

Yeah.

00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,976
Maybe you could drive
the night shift.

477
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:23,238
I could do that.

Oh, you don't have to do that.

Yes, it was. Yes.

Mmm-hmm.

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,289
It's funny.

511
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:54,727
But you should never talk
to a woman like that,

512
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:55,861
you know that, Greg.

513
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,336
It's disrespectful.

524
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,419
That, too. Right. Yeah. Sure.

525
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:23,623
Now, my grandson, Little Jack,
is part of that legacy.

526
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,167
In six months, you and Pam
are gonna be married.

527
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,223
Sometime after that,

528
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:29,270
you'll want to start
a family of your own.

529
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:30,965
Yeah. Right.
Actually, on the subject,

530
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,904
I had some thoughts
about the wedding date.

531
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:35,465
We'll discuss that later,
after this weekend, Greg.

532
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:36,806
Now, let's get back on point.

533
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:38,607
Let me put it very simply.

534
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,079
If your family circle

535
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,378
does indeed join
my family circle,

536
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:44,112
they'll form a chain.

537
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,811
I can't have a chink
in my chain.

538
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:47,877
Hmm.

539
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:50,389
Yeah. Okay.
I get the metaphor.

540
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,120
Now,
I've never met your parents,

541
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:54,856
so I'm not going to jump
to any hasty conclusions.

542
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,023
But, like studying
a frozen caveman,

543
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,794
if I can see
where you came from,

544
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:01,358
I'll have a much better idea
of where you're going.

545
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:02,562
Okay.

546
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:06,004
A-are you thinking
maybe my parents might be

547
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,099
like... like a chink
in the chain or...

548
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,143
A doctor and a lawyer,
what's there to worry about?

549
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,006
Mmm-hmm.

550
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:28,652
[birds cawing]

551
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,505
(Dina)
Ooh, it seems very nice.

552
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:43,767
[karate cries]

553
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,911
Is that your father?

554
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:49,246
[karate cries]

555
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,418
That is my father.

556
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,182
[karate cries]

557
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:03,631
(Bernie)
Hey! There you are.

558
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,097
What the heck is
that contraption?

559
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:06,998
I thought you guys
were flying in tonight.

560
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,968
I left a message yesterday
We were driving...

561
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:10,436
Oh, I didn't get a message.

562
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:12,029
(Greg)
I left you like five messages.

563
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:14,007
Will you get over here
and plant one on me.

564
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,133
Talking about messages.

565
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,702
I've been waiting so long
to see you. My best buddy.

566
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,008
Good to see you.

567
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,311
Come here. Come here.
Oh, I missed you.

568
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:24,909
Is this not
the most handsome young man

569
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,419
you've ever seen
in your life?

570
00:21:26,488 --> 00:21:29,389
I used to call him
a young Jewish Marlon Brando.

571
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:30,547
Huh?

572
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,748
[all laughing]

573
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,255
Can you believe

574
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,387
I conceived him
with one testicle?

575
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:37,159
(Bernie)
No, really. It's true.

576
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,530
I only have one because
the other never dropped.

577
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,432
It's called
an undescending testicle.

578
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,937
It's not uncommon,
but look at him.

579
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:47,267
Imagine what he would have
looked like if I had two.

580
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,543
[Greg chuckling]

581
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,546
That's a good icebreaker.

582
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:53,841
Whoa!
Ho!

583
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,644
There's the sexiest
second grade teacher

584
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:57,309
I've ever seen in my life.

585
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:58,579
[sputtering]

586
00:21:58,653 --> 00:21:59,813
That was a good one.

587
00:21:59,888 --> 00:22:00,980
It gets her every time.

588
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:02,921
Goose bumps. She loves it.

589
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:05,585
I'm Dina Byrnes.
It's so nice to meet you.

590
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,424
The pleasure is all mine,
<i>mon cheri. </i>

591
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,730
[exclaiming]

592
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,729
You got to be the flower man.

593
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:14,860
That's right.
Jack Byrnes, Pam's father.

594
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,870
And I'm Bernard Focker,
Gaylord's father,

595
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:20,271
and we're all grownups here
and we shake hands like men.

596
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:21,998
All right.

597
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,544
[all laughing]

598
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:25,409
Oh, we're just playing here.

599
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,970
Give me some love.

600
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,674
We're family now.

601
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,721
What're you so shy about?
Come here.

602
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:38,257
Oh, wow. Look at those pecs.

603
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:39,759
Wow! You're harder
than sheetrock.

604
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,056
Now tell me the truth.

605
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:42,528
You work out
with weights, right?

606
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,030
Well, I do
various calisthenics.

607
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,227
Some medicine-ball training,
I play bimonthly football.

608
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:48,894
Oh, footie-footie football?

609
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,302
I was just, uh,
practicing my Capoeira. What?

610
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, Capoeira. Yeah.

611
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,201
The Brazilian martial art
of dance fighting. Yes.

612
00:22:55,277 --> 00:22:57,211
He knows what that is. Yeah.

613
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,873
You know,
I've been doing it for weeks.

614
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:01,108
I'm really into it.

615
00:23:01,182 --> 00:23:02,809
It keeps me level.

616
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,909
Because sometimes
I get wound up so tight,

617
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:06,749
I could just snap.

618
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,118
You know what I mean?

619
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,178
[Little Jack wailing]

620
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,656
What is that?
What is that?

621
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,953
Is there a baby on board?

622
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,688
That's a baby. Yes, yes.

623
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,989
Yeah. Hmm-mmm.
It was all in the message.

624
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,429
[Moses barking]

625
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:18,864
Hey, Moses, go ahead,

626
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,731
say hello to
your future in-laws.

627
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:22,429
No, no, he's harmless.

628
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:23,903
And yeah, fixed.
Moses.

629
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,166
That's all right.

630
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,502
(Bernie)
Just shake him off.

631
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,372
Oh, no. Don't shake.
He likes the shaking.

632
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:29,535
Moses, get off!

633
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:31,704
No, don't worry.
The pink part
didn't get on you.

634
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,611
(Greg)
Moses, go, get in your basket.
Go!

635
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:35,013
(Bernie)
He's all talk.

636
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,675
Who's this little guy?

637
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,412
This is our grandson,
Little Jack.

638
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,113
Oh, little baby.

639

[babbling]

640
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:43,786
How are you,
Little Jack?

641
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,359
Hey, Dad, don't... don't...
don't infantilize him.

642
00:23:46,428 --> 00:23:47,656
Just talk to him
like a person.

643
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:49,424
What are you talking about?
He's a baby.

644
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,158
I want to talk to him
like he's a baby.

645
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:52,927
Bazooka! Bazooka!

646
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:55,626
[wailing]

647
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,296
(Bernie)
He likes me.

648
00:23:58,073 --> 00:23:59,973
When Roz's dad died, I said:

649
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,669
<i>"</i>Hey, we're freezing our
tushies off here in Detroit. <i>"</i>

650
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:04,268
You know, <i>"</i>Let's head south

651
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:06,371
and get some year-round fun
in the sun. <i>"</i>

652
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:08,746
This house is
over a 100 years old, so...

653
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,216
Dad. Dad,
you continue the tour.

654
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,877
I'm gonna tell Mom
we're here, okay?

655
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:13,750
Oh! The upstairs bathroom
is on el fritzo.

656
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:15,949
So we're all gonna have to
share this one for now.

657
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:17,958
Since there's a water scarcity
on the island,

658
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:20,620
we kind of abide by the
<i>"</i>if it's yellow let it mellow,

659
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:22,925
if it's brown
flush it down<i>"</i> policy.

660
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:27,257
Oops. Forgot my own rule.

[toilet flushing]

662
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:32,906
The RV has paid
for itself already.

663
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,265
##[music playing]
All right, kids.

664
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,368
Forward and backward.

665
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:41,243
(Roz)
Rotate those hips.

666
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:43,910
Let's get your
kundalini rising.

667
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,816
And now it's time
for the ladies

668
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,878
to get into the reverse
cowgirl position.

669
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:50,015
Guys, you have to
lie across the Liberator pad

670
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:51,080
like so.

671
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,057
Everyone look at
how Ira's doing it.

672
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:54,891
Bingo. Bango. Bungo.

673
00:24:54,963 --> 00:24:57,898
The man is loose, he's limber
and he's ready for action.

674
00:24:57,966 --> 00:24:59,263
So, climb aboard, girls,

675
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,234
and let me hear
your bodies talk.

676
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:02,360
Ooh!

677
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:03,961
Whoa! Yes!

678
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,404
This position is terrific

679
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:08,442
for anyone with osteoporosis,
gout or goiter.

680
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,740
Stay with me, kids.
We're almost done.

681
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:13,447
Ah! Honey!

682
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,039
Oh! All right, guys.

683
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,777
We have to wrap it up.
Everyone.

684
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:18,716
Remember to take
your Liberator pads.

685
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:21,551
And don't forget to stretch
before you try this at home.

686
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:24,224
We don't want anyone
shattering a pelvis.

687
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:26,384
Hello, my precious.

688
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:27,894
Oh, I love you so much.

689
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:30,453
I haven't seen
my bubeleh in months.

690
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:31,829
Honey, you feel thin.
No, no.

691
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,492
You're not eating.
What's the matter?

692
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:36,469
No. I'm fine. Mom, how do
we explain all these people
to the Byrneses?

693
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,098
Honey, they're leaving.
The Byrneses won't know
they were here.

694
00:25:39,174 --> 00:25:42,473
Okay. We agreed to be discreet
about you being
a sex therapist this weekend

695
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:44,535
until you got to know
Jack and Dina better. Right?

696
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:46,705
Don't worry. I'll be discreet.
I put all my toys away.

697
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,772
And my office is all ready
for them to sleep in.

698
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,784
Your office? No, no.
we're putting them upstairs.

699
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:53,116
Your father thought they'd be
more comfortable down here.

700
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:55,179
The upstairs plumbing...
You don't wanna know.

701
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,156
Talk to me about
something important, honey.

702
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,487
How are things
with you and Pam?

703
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,584
They're great.

704
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,094
Because, you know,
after two years,

705
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,891
you have to work
to keep things going.

706
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:04,727
Does she still
climax regularly?

707
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:05,923
Mom.

708
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,934
You can't talk that way
this weekend, okay?

709
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,128
Honey, I'm just saying

710
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:10,831
I didn't raise you
to be a so-so lover.

711
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,770
I know.
Okay, what is he doing?

712
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:15,241
What?
Don't... don't worry about them.

713
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:16,536
Mom, Mom,

714
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:18,511
you got to get these people
out of here now.

715
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,569
Okay.

716
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,875
Wipe that
little gloss off you.

717
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:21,973
Okay.

718
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:25,118
You hunt deer, Bernard?

719
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:26,778
What? No, I hate that thing.

720
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:28,288
Roz's father gave it to us.

721
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,553
He was into all that
macho-wacho crap.

722
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:32,684
Oh! So is Greg.

723
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,286
He and I went
duck-hunting together.
Didn't we, Greg? Hmm?

724
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:36,694
Duck-hunting?
Me and you?

725
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:37,925
Duck-hunting?
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

726
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,023
What? What?

727
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,694
Gay, you went duck-hunting
with... with Jack?

728
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:43,761
Um, yeah. We went, we did.

729
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:45,430
We went
on a little hunting trip.

730
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:46,633
You shot a duck?

731
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,438
I shot at a duck and...
Mmm-hmm.

732
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:52,139
You killed an
innocent creature of the sky?

733
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:53,805
I don't... Did I...
I did... I don't...

734
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:55,850
I think
I might've clipped it or...

735
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,782
Never really checked.

736
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,040
Oh, Lord.

737
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:30,676
And now,
for the piece de resistance.

738
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,550
[gasping]
Oh, my goodness.

739
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:36,283
Little somethin'
I've been workin' on.

740
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:38,348
Oh, I see. Oh.

741
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:42,319
Mom will be out in a sec.
What's that?

742
00:27:42,397 --> 00:27:43,694
It's you.

743
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,130
It's the Wall of Gaylord.

744
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,301
The Wall of Gaylord?

745
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:50,767
Isn't it nice to finally
display your accomplishments,
Son?

746
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,238
Honey, look
at all your awards.

747
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:53,467
That's great.

748
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,565
He's my champion.

749
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:55,631
Oh, I didn't know

750
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,371
they made ninth place
ribbons.

751
00:27:57,445 --> 00:28:00,005
Oh, Jack, they got them
all the way up to 10th place.

752
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:02,208
Hey! Anybody want to
get a drink by the lagoon?

753
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:03,750
This one looks impressive.

754
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:07,982
<i>"</i>Mazel tov, Gaylord M. Focker.
World's Greatest Nurse. <i>"</i>

755
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,114
[chuckling]

756
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,179
Very nice.

757
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:11,520
We've always tried

758
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:13,584
to instill a sense of self
in Gaylord

759
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:15,993
without being
too goal-oriented.

760
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,827
It's not about
winning or losing,

761
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:18,888
it's about passion.

762
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,759
We just want him
to love what he's doin'.

763
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:24,236
You know what I mean, Jack?

764
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:25,704
Not really, Bernard.

765
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,240
I think
a competitive drive

766
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,969
is the essential key
that makes America

767
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:31,637
the only remaining superpower
in the world today.

768
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,680
Well, whatever works.
Mmm-hmm.

769
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:36,808
(Roz)
All right.
Don't forget the positions.

770
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:38,352
Bye, Dr. Roz.
You're a lifesaver.

771
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,614
Oh, Thank you, BJ.
Goodbye.

772
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:42,212
Ira, remember,
easy on the thrusting.

773
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,917
You're not 78 anymore.

774
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:45,550
(lra)
Bing, bang, bong.

775
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:48,221
What... What kind of work
does your mother
do with those patients?

776
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:51,129
Those look like yoga mats.
Is there yoga involved?

777
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,427
It's yogaesque.

778
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,263
It's sort of, um,

779
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,064
a, um, a... a... a
couples therapy.

780
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,434
Kind of mind-body...

781
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:58,995
It's kind of
her own sort of...

782
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:01,735
Rozela! Sweetheart,
living room!

783
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,108
Hello! Hello! Hello!

784
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,305
How are you, baby girl?

785
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:07,643
Good, Roz.

786
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,649
God! Look at you,
you're glowing!

787
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:10,911
Oh, thank you.

788
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:13,215
Hi, I'm Roz Focker

789
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:15,882
you must be Jack,
and you must be Dina.

790
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:17,117
Hi.

791
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,522
l... I just can't believe

792
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,254
it's taken us
this long to meet, huh.

793
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:22,586
And who's
this little hairball?

794
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,757
They brought their grandson
Baby Jack along.

795
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:28,097
He's so adorable.
I could eat him up.

796
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,228
Bern, did you show them
where they're sleeping?

797
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:32,967
Right, right, right.
Because we don't
have any air-conditioning,

798
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:36,374
I made up a nice spot for you
in Roz's office 'cause it
gets the best breeze,

799
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:38,275
and it's very near
the communal commode.

800
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:41,213
Oh, well, you know,
actually, we're gonna
stay in our motor home.

801
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:42,476
In the trailer?

802
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,518
Come on, Jack.
You're family.

803
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:45,813
We sleep under the same roof.

804
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:47,855
Actually, Mom's office
is kind of cluttered.

805
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:49,287
So, that... that
works all right.

806
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:51,154
It's just really easier
with Little Jack.

807
00:29:51,225 --> 00:29:52,988
No, no. Really.
We insist.

808
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,585
They wanna sleep
in the trailer,

809
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:55,993
let them sleep
in the trailer.

810
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,964
Mom, it's not actually...
It's not a trailer.

811
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,227
It's kind of like...
It's like a... like a
hotel on wheels.

812
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:03,236
This is practically a hotel.
I was gonna do
the turndown service...

813
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:05,295
I know, I know,
but it's their choice.

814
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,637
Wherever you feel
most comfortable is fine.

815
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,506
(Bernie)
It's not right.
Bern, let it go.

816
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:10,839
Let it go? Fine.

817
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:12,072
Yeah, let it go.

818
00:30:12,146 --> 00:30:13,943
Look at you, sulking.

819
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:16,006
Now, look at this.
I married a teenager. Right?

820
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:18,450
At least you have the libido
of a teenager.

821
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,316
I gave her
a little matinee today...

822
00:30:20,388 --> 00:30:22,322
Oh! Don't you dare!
Stop it!

823
00:30:22,857 --> 00:30:24,688
[chuckling]
How about a double feature?

824
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:25,915
[laughing]

825
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:27,788
(Bernie)
Come on. Come on.

826
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:30,524
Lagoon? Why don't we go
show them the lagoon?

827
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,293
The lagoon.
Come see the lagoon.

828
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,994
The lagoon, Jack. Come on.

829
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:35,432
We'll get drunk,

830
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:37,164
we'll take a piss
in the lagoon.

831
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:39,707
(Bernie)
Roz, why don't you
take them outside?

832
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:41,264
Show them around.
I'll make a drink.

833
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:50,011
Oh, God.

834
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,111
(Greg)
Hey, Dad...

835
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,778
It's going good
so far, right?

836
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,415
Dad, you gotta take down
that weird shrine thing.

837
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:57,924
But I'm very proud
of you, Gaylord.

838
00:30:57,992 --> 00:30:59,289
What's wrong with showing it?

839
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,691
It's ridiculous.

840
00:31:00,762 --> 00:31:02,923
Most people aren't proud
of sixth place ribbons.

841
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:03,986
Most people?

842
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:05,794
Since when do you care
about most people?

843
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:08,961
I don't, but Jack
is really into winning

844
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,834
and competition and sports.

845
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,668
It's a whole other thing
with him.

846
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,402
Hey. Hey. You're a winner
up here and in here.

847
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,239
And that's all that matters.

848
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:18,744
Okay. Thank you.

849
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,780
I don't know what that means,
but thank you.

850
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:22,304
(Jack)
So, to solve that problem,

851
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,375
I created a life-like
latex left breast

852
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,853
molded from his mother's
actual left breast,

853
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:30,516
so this way LJ would avoid
any nipple confusion.

854
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:34,652
You're avoiding confusion
by strapping a boob on a man?

855
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:36,094
Well, yes, believe it or not,

856
00:31:36,164 --> 00:31:38,064
it is less confusing
because of the texture

857
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:39,190
Mom.

858
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:41,235
...of the breast itself.

859
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:45,204
Uh, I guess it's very,
uh, creative.

860
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:46,262
It's very creative.

861
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,604
##[Bernie humming]

862
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:53,045
A little birdie told me
that one of our guests here

863
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:55,014
is a Tom Collins man.

864
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,380
[all laughing]

865
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:57,645
Oh, for pity's sake.

866
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:59,345
Isn't that nice, Jack?

867
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,047
That is nice. Thank you.

868
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:04,580
(Bernie)
All right. Wait. Don't drink.
I want to make a toast.

869
00:32:06,194 --> 00:32:09,493
Now,
I had a vasectomy in 1974...

870
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:10,622
'73, honey.

871
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:11,858
You're right. '73.

872
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:14,731
So, unfortunately,
I never had the chance
to procreate a daughter,

873
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,030
but had I been able to,

874
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:18,732
I really
would've wanted a girl

875
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:21,172
as sensitive
and as intelligent

876
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:22,809
and as beautiful

877
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:26,205
as this young lady
sitting right here before us.

878
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:27,807
Thank you, Bernie.

879
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,076
And if I might add...

880
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,174
Greg.

881
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:31,643
Yeah.

882
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,553
I thought you had a sister?

883
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,646
Nope. No sister.

884
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:37,791
You said you had a sister.

885
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:40,089
You said
you milked your sister's cat.

886
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:48,563
(Bernie)
Okay, I'm not done yet.
What I'm trying to say is,

887
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:51,433
it's taken far too long
to do this, you know,

888
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:53,698
but we're finally
all together.

889
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:55,742
(Roz)
That's nice, honey.

890
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,369
Oh, thank you.

891
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:01,079
All right, that's enough.

892
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:02,776
L'chaim, everyone.

893
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,044
(all)
L'chaim!

894
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:05,517
L'ha-ha.

895
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:08,487
Like you have popcorn
stuck in the throat. It's a...

896
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:10,179
Okay. To family.

897
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,953
[all laughing]

898
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,182
To family.

899
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:14,318
Oh! I forgot.

900
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:16,488
I want to say one more
thing about my vasectomy.

901
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:17,792
(Roz)
Sit down.

902
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:20,197
Honey,
get yourself over here.

903
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:21,257
I went overboard?

904
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,324
(Roz)
A little bit.

905
00:33:22,403 --> 00:33:25,201
You're so cute,
they'll forgive you anything.

906
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:27,373
(Bernie)
God! You're so beautiful.

907
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,841
[whispering]
You are the sexiest woman
alive I know.

908
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:32,778
Mmm. You're just trying to
get me back into bed.

909
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,007
(Bernie)
Or the hammock.

910
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:35,139
[clearing throat]

911
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:36,979
This is
a delicious Tom Collins.

912
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:39,383
What I did,
I used real lemon juice.

913
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:41,444
It's from our trees here.
That's the secret.

914
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,353
He was squeezing
all afternoon.

915
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,584
Yeah. And, Jack,

916
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,422
I managed to make some
lemon juice, too.

917
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,086
[both laughing]

918
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,158
[gasping]

919
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:51,789
(Bernie)
Gay, you all right?

920
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,493
Honey, you okay?
Are you sure?

921
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:55,801
[frogs croaking]

922
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,898
Well, I think

923
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:05,070
that Roz and Bernie seem like
very nice people.

924
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,943
Oh! Very nice people.

925
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:09,339
A little off-color,
but very nice.

926
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,214
Oh! But isn't it
wonderful, Jack?

927
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:12,684
After all this buildup,

928
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:14,380
the kids
are finally getting married.

929
00:34:14,455 --> 00:34:16,082
I feel so happy.

930
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:18,091
Wait a second.
I think he just spoke.

931
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,650
Little Jack,
were you about to speak?

932
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:21,717
[farts]

933
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,122
Nope,
just a little flatulence.

934
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,689
What were you saying, honey?

935
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,064
Nothing, dear.

936
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,599
Guys, where are you going?

937
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:35,403
We're checking out
Jack's macho-wacho trailer.

938
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:37,068
Yeah.
I want to see that boob.

939
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:39,237
Can I talk to you
for a sec?
Yeah.

940
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:41,645
Hey, listen,
don't let Moses go in there.
They have a cat.

941
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,377
Moses is perfectly trained...

942
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,214
Dad, he humps
everything that moves.

943
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,583
Honey,
he's like his father.

944
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:47,916
I never cheated on you.

945
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,082
They're not listening to me.

946
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,154
So, what's up?

947
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:56,560
They seem to be
getting along really well,
don't you think?

948
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:59,361
Yeah, they do. I know.
I kind of feel bad
that I worried so much.

949
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,832
Yeah. That was okay.

950
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,198
What's going on?

951
00:35:03,704 --> 00:35:04,932
I'm pregnant.

952
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:06,835
You're pregnant?
Mmm-hmm.

953
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,441
I'm two weeks late.
I'm nauseous,

954
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,341
my boobs hurt,
and I can smell everything.

955
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:14,040
You're gonna have a baby.
Yeah. A baby.

956
00:35:14,115 --> 00:35:15,946
Oh, we're gonna
have a little baby, a baby.

957
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:17,177
I'm pregnant.

958
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:18,718
I just... I...

959
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:20,345
[laughing]

960
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:22,945
Yeah.

961
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:26,186
Oh, shit!

962
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:30,962
You realize your father
is going to kill me?

963
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:32,799
No, no, no, no, no.

964
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,358
He's not gonna find out
because we're
not going to tell him.

965
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:37,927
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
He's a human lie detector.

966
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,597
He lives to sniff out
stuff like this.

967
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:40,902
We'll get
through this weekend,

968
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,067
we'll get through tomorrow.

969
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,441
And... and... and we'll
tell them on Sunday
before we go.

970
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,604
Okay? We'll tell them all.

971
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,171
I just hate the idea
of keeping secrets
from your dad.

972
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,240
It's just one little secret.

973
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:52,552
Oh! Hi, neighbors.

974
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,746
Hello.

975
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,049
The Fockers, honey.

976
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:56,589
A la fancy-shmancy.

977
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,022
Welcome to the chateau.

978
00:35:58,092 --> 00:36:00,253
No wonder they
don't want to sleep
in our shit box.

979
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:01,590
Look at this place.

980
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:02,686
[Moses barking]

981
00:36:02,763 --> 00:36:05,254
l... I don't think the dog
is such a good idea.

982
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,858
Don't worry. Moses is more
of a lover than a fighter.

983
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,562
Jesus!
Moses!

984
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:12,003
He's always dreamt of me
having a white wedding.

985
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:13,734
You don't know how upset
he's gonna be.

986
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:14,866
No, I do know.

987
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,206
(Bernie)
Moses! Moses!

988
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,302
(Jack)
Jinxy!

989
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:20,472
(Greg)
Dad, I told you
to keep him out of the RV.

990
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:21,913
He said he
wanted to see the RV.

991
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:23,006
Dad!

992
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,176
Moses! Moses!

993
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:26,549
(Jack)
Get that goddamn dog
out of here!

994
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,779
Mo!

995
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
(Bernie)
Oh, God!

996
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:34,788
Dad!

997
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,022
[Moses whimpering]

998
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:37,086
(Greg)
Oh! Jinx.

999
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:38,153
Jinx, don't do it.

1000
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:39,221
Jinxy, no.

1001
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,289
Don't do it!

1002
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:41,357
(all three)
No!

1003
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:42,595
[whimpering]

1004
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,434
Jesus! Moses! Hold on.

1005
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:51,073
Moses, hold on.
I'm gonna save you!

1006
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:52,544
The cat can flush?

1007
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,242
Oh, my God!

1008
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,680
[Little Jack wailing]

1009
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,241
Get out of the way!

1010
00:36:57,318 --> 00:36:59,548
(Jack)
Hey! What the hell are
you doing? That's my toilet!

1011
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,712
I got to get my dog!

1012
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:02,722
Forget your dog.
What about my toilet?

1013
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,480
Moses!

1014
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:05,647
[grunts]

1015
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,384
[yelling]

1016
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:08,755
[sobbing]

1017
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:10,761
(Pam)
No! Stop the baby!
Stop the baby!

1018
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:12,254
[screaming]

1019
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,735
[wailing continues]

1020
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,002
(Bernie)
He's alive!

1021
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,638
He's fine.

1022
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,272
So much for the protection
of our rolling safe house.

1023
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:30,010
Oh, honey, he was trying
to save his pet.

1024
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:31,574
I mean, what if it was Jinxy

1025
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,051
who got flushed
into a toilet?

1026
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,315
Mr. Jinx has had
extensive aquatic training.

1027
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,290
He would have known
exactly what to do
in the event of a submersion.

1028
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,383
[purring]

1029
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:41,988
[growling]

1030
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:43,188
[clearing throat]

1031
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:45,323
20-minute warning for dinner,
guys.

1032
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:47,333
Sorry about
the trailer, Jack.

1033
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,232
[whispering]
Muskrat.

1034
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,973
It's okay, Bernard.

1035
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,303
[growling]

1036
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,702
There's no way
we're not telling him
this weekend.

1037
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,405
I know.
That's what I was saying.

1038
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,538
So, what do you wanna do?

1039
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,639
I'm not sure.
I never thought
this'd be an issue.

1040
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,707
I thought we'd be married
before we got pregnant.

1041
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,047
Hey.
What?

1042
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:09,616
Why don't we move
the wedding up to next month?

1043
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,748
What?

1044
00:38:10,825 --> 00:38:11,917
Then we'll tell your dad

1045
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:13,960
you got pregnant
on the honeymoon.

1046
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:16,153
Oh, my God, yeah,
that could work.

1047
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,720
Yeah. It's perfect,
right?
Yeah.

1048
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,197
Okay. Good.
Just follow my lead.

1049
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,756
Okay.
Okay.

1050
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,198
##[humming]

1051
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,205
Without further ado,
my famous Focker Fondue.

1052
00:38:26,273 --> 00:38:27,638
[all applauding]

1053
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,801
Come on, dig in. Come on.
Get it while it's hot.

1054
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:33,040
That is so impressive, Bernie.
Did you do that yourself?

1055
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:35,013
Oh, sure.
Oh! I love to cook.

1056
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,208
I can't even fry an egg.

1057
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:37,272
(Bernie)
True.

1058
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:38,511
I burn cornflakes.

1059
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:40,845
I'm amazed
he finds the time to cook

1060
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:42,946
with such a high-powered
legal career.

1061
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,181
High-powered?

1062
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,815
I wouldn't exactly call...
Uh-oh!

1063
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,690
You kicked me.
Why did you kick me?

1064
00:38:47,761 --> 00:38:51,026
I kick... kicked you
because you're being modest

1065
00:38:51,098 --> 00:38:53,896
and you should tell people
that you are a good lawyer,
which he is,

1066
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,526
a-a-and he has fought

1067
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,534
some really big,
important legal battles.

1068
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,937
Truth is, Jack,
when Gay was born,
I stopped practicing

1069
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,373
and became
a stay-at-home dad.

1070
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:03,636
Oh, believe me,

1071
00:39:03,711 --> 00:39:05,303
he won a trial or two
in his day.

1072
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:07,074
Oh!
Extremely good trial lawyer.

1073
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:08,671
A regular Clarence Darrow.

1074
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,216
So Roz was
the primary breadwinner

1075
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:11,842
and you didn't have a job?

1076
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,113
(Pam)
Dad.

1077
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:16,350
Honey, come on, you could say
he had the hardest job.

1078
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,082
Oh, he's... he's just kidding.

1079
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:19,420
Of course, I'm... Yes.

1080
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:21,859
Why don't we jump into
the topic of the hour, hmm,

1081
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,191
the big
Focker-Byrnes wedding.

1082
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:24,458
Yes. Good.

1083
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:27,693
I know we've been talking
about a... a fall wedding...

1084
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:30,066
[Bernie speaking in Spanish]

1085
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,399
[woman speaking in Spanish]

1086
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:32,700
Is that Isabel?

1087
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,037
Oh, yeah. Our former
housekeeper, Isabel.

1088
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,805
You know, she has
her own catering business now,
isn't that great?

1089
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:40,904
And... and I asked her
to come and help Bernie
in the kitchen this weekend.

1090
00:39:40,981 --> 00:39:42,312
You didn't tell me
she was here.

1091
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:44,408
Gay had a monster crush
on her
when he was a teenager.

1092
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:45,509
(Pam)
Really?

1093
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:47,247
I didn't have
any monster crush.

1094
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:48,720
You didn't tell me
about that.

1095
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:49,881
Yeah. Because it's not true.

1096
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:52,949
Oh, not true? Then I didn't
catch you doing baziga
to her passport photo

1097
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,051
when you were, what, 13?

1098
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:55,117
(Roz)
Honey, stop.

1099
00:39:55,195 --> 00:39:56,492
(Bernie)
I walk in the door...

1100
00:39:56,564 --> 00:39:57,656
(lsabel)
Where is he?

1101
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,289
Oh, there's my baby!

1102
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:00,458
Hey!

1103
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:03,292
[laughs]

1104
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,631
[both exclaiming]

1105
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,105
Good to see you.

1106
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:08,597
Mmm. Good to see you.

1107
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:10,268
l... I haven't
seen you in years.

1108
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:11,333
I know.

1109
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,877
Mmm.
Yes, you...

1110
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,211
Wow! Yeah. Look at you.
You look...

1111
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,306
I know.

1112
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:17,407
Yeah. You look...

1113
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:18,712
I had a boob job.
Wow.

1114
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:19,980
[cooing]

1115
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,487
Yeah. Yeah.

1116
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:24,481
Hey! This is, uh,
Dina and Jack Byrnes.

1117
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:25,616
<i>Mucho gusto. </i>

1118
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:26,682
Hi, Isabel.

1119
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,749
<i>Mucho gusto. </i>

1120
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,797
And this is Pam Byrnes,
my fiancee.

1121
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:32,855
<i>Encantada. </i>

1122
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,798
Nice to meet you, too.

1123
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:38,838
Not yet married,
and already a little one?

1124
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:41,974
And he is
a handsome little Focker.

1125
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,100
[laughs]

1126
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:44,201
See?

1127
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,540
Oh, no. He's not a Focker.

1128
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:46,978
Yeah, no.
He's not mine.

1129
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,538
And still you stayed
to raise her child?

1130
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:50,741
Good for you.

1131
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,183
No, he's Pam's nephew.

1132
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,754
He has no connection
to Greg whatsoever.

1133
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,422
[babbling]

1134
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,784
[speaking in Spanish]

1135
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,052
[babbling]

1136
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,423
I love you, too.

1137
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:02,223
Mama! Mama!
Mama!

1138
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,328
[all laughing]

1139
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:05,865
Little Jack, no.

1140
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,366
Those aren't for you.

1141
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:10,232
[mooing]

1142
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:11,735
[babbling]

1143
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:12,794
Oh.

1144
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,096
Mom.

1145
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:16,369
I think I'll take
him inside.

1146
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:17,905
(Jack)
Good idea.

1147
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:23,549
You're a very
lucky woman, Pam.

1148
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:25,710
He's very special,
this one.

1149
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,077
[laughing]

1150
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,917
I think so, too.

1151
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,355
Oh, I could tell you
some stories about him.

1152
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,585
Really?

1153
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:35,161
Oh, she's just
being silly.

1154
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:36,956
Nice to meet you all.

1155
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,498
Nice to meet you.

1156
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:41,226
So sweet. Oh! So sweet.

1157
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:42,900
[clears throat]

1158
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,801
Hey, do you guys
want some more, uh, wine?

1159
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,341
<i>Mas vino por la mama, si. </i>

1160
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:50,766
Hey.

1161
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,240
Hey, you did good, Greg.

1162
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,281
She's very pretty,
this one, huh?

1163
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,749
Yeah, she's, uh,
she's really great.

1164
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:58,842
Really great.

1165
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,547
Can you believe
it's been 15 years?

1166
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,317
[speaking in Spanish]

1167
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,790
So many wonderful memories
from those days.

1168
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,293
Yes. Yes, lot of wonderful,

1169
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:12,059
kind of private memories.

1170
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:16,398
So, you never told
your fiancee about us, huh?

1171
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,165
Um, no, I don't think I did.

1172
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:20,604
I don't, I think,
I don't think it ever
came up on my end.

1173
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:23,074
Not that I didn't
want her to know.
It just, never really...

1174
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:25,441
Yeah, and not that, l... I mean,
not that it wasn't great.

1175
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:27,742
It was really, you know,
for me it was like...

1176
00:42:27,815 --> 00:42:29,248
And you were so

1177
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:30,908
helpful and... and...

1178
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:32,315
Don't you worry, baby.

1179
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:33,853
Your secret's safe with me.

1180
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:34,943
Okay.

1181
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,745
There's no secrets.
But, good, yeah,

1182
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:38,849
maybe if we keep it quiet
this weekend and then...

1183
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:41,019
Because, yeah, I don't want
Pam to feel uncomfortable.

1184
00:42:41,095 --> 00:42:44,087
And then later, when it's
the proper, you know, setting,
I can...

1185
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,724
Okay, yeah, okay, good.
And, uh...

1186
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,056
Good.

1187
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:51,396
Oh, and fondue, fondue
is going... is goin' over.

1188
00:42:51,472 --> 00:42:53,770
Gay, you're just in time
to hear me tell the gang

1189
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,832
how you lost
your virginity to Isabel.

1190
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,399
[door closing]

1191
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:01,080
(Bernie)
He was 19. A late bloomer.

1192
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,947
You s-slept with Isabel?

1193
00:43:04,017 --> 00:43:05,609
We were relieved.

1194
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:08,144
Why... why would you,
why... why would you
bring that up?

1195
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:09,246
What's the problem?

1196
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:10,688
It was, what, 15 years ago.

1197
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:12,191
Honey, your father thought

1198
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,590
that it'd be fun
to share stories

1199
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,922
about our first time.

1200
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:17,655
Really? That sounds like fun.
That's...

1201
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:19,426
That's fine.

1202
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,968
Come on, tell us how
you popped your cherry.
Come on.

1203
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:23,966
I really don't feel
comfortable

1204
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:25,504
discussing that
with you, Bernard.

1205
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:28,473
You know what? I suggest that
we get back to talking
about the wedding.

1206
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,009
Thank you, Bernie.

1207
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:31,237
[Little Jack wailing]

1208
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:32,437
What?

1209
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,743
Mom, didn't you just take
Little Jack back to the room?

1210
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,646
I'm monitoring him
from a high-powered

1211
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,981
multidirectional microphone
planted in his crib.

1212
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:41,680
Oh, baby monitors.
Hidden cameras.

1213
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:44,053
Whatever happened
to a little thing
called privacy?

1214
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,183
Bernie,
surveillance technology
has helped protect

1215
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,488
a lot of the freedoms

1216
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:49,495
that we as Americans
take advantage of today.

1217
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,158
He's right.
It has been good.

1218
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,136
S-son, that is bullcrap
in a chef's salad.

1219
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:03,040
Jack, tell me one smart thing
the CLIA has done

1220
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,476
and I'll give you
the deed to her house.

1221
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:06,843
The CLIA?

1222
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:09,144
The Central Lack
of Intelligence Agency.

1223
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,444
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1224
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:16,145
[Little Jack wailing]

1225
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,784
I think that baby might need
a couple of pulls

1226
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:22,419
on that knocker
of yours, Jack.

1227
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,093
[both laughing]

1228
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:26,256
No, it's okay.

1229
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,425
We're Ferberizing him.

1230
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:28,991
You're what?
The Ferber method.

1231
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:31,799
You let him cry it out.
This way he doesn't
depend on coddling.

1232
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:34,136
On the other hand,
the Continuum Concept

1233
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,971
shows that a baby benefits

1234
00:44:36,043 --> 00:44:38,443
more from constant
physical contact.

1235
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:39,501
Oh.

1236
00:44:40,514 --> 00:44:41,947
We use the Ferber Method.

1237
00:44:42,082 --> 00:44:43,549
We used the Focker Method.

1238
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:45,513
We hugged and kissed
that little prince

1239
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:47,281
like there was no tomorrow.

1240
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,821
We Fockerized him.

1241
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:50,983
That's right.

1242
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:53,185
Greggy practically slept
in our bed till he was 10.

1243
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,249
Oh, my God!

1244
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:56,057
Oh, I don't think
it was quite that long.

1245
00:44:56,129 --> 00:44:57,118
Yes, it was.

1246
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,221
No, it wasn't 10.

1247
00:44:58,298 --> 00:44:59,925
Nine-and-a-half, at least.

1248
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,126
Mom, I don't think so.

1249
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,431
I didn't sleep
in their bed all that time.

1250
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:04,936
(Roz)
Bernie, get the photo album.

1251
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,131
I'm one step ahead of you.

1252
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:09,039
No, no, no,
we're eating dinner, come on.

1253
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,410
These are the curls

1254
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:13,275
from his first trip
to the barbershop.

1255
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:15,076
Nobody wants to see this.

1256
00:45:15,148 --> 00:45:17,013
Oh, and you kept
all of his baby teeth.

1257
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:18,813
Look at his
darling little teeth,

1258
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:21,013
isn't that sweet?

1259
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:24,251
Uh-oh, somebody looks
very grumpy there.

1260
00:45:24,324 --> 00:45:25,916
Oh, that's Gay with the mohel.

1261
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:27,085
The mohel?
No.

1262
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,357
(Roz)
He's the man who snips
the baby's little winkydink.

1263
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,990
See, that's Greg getting
circumcised, right here.

1264
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,125
We had the ceremony
at my parents' house

1265
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,033
but there was a cold snap
and... Tell him.

1266
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:38,230
The heater conked out.

1267
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:39,329
Mom.

1268
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,806
No matter how hard he tried,
the mohel couldn't coax

1269
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,173
Greg's tiny little turtle
from its shell.

1270
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:46,712
You know what?
Let's not talk about
the tiny turtle, okay?

1271
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,940
Let's... Th-this is dinner.

1272
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:50,745
Honey, half the people
at this table have penises.

1273
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:52,546
Mom, control yourself.

1274
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:55,087
Roz, he's right.
You're embarrassing him.

1275
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:56,954
Okay, I'm sorry.

1276
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:00,152
Make a long story short, Jack,
he wound up with a semicirc.

1277
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:02,585
[giggling]

1278
00:46:02,663 --> 00:46:03,925
What's a semicirc?

1279
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:05,259
I can't wait to hear this.

1280
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:08,301
What? It's a cross between
an ant eater and...

1281
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:09,835
A German Army helmet.

1282
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,427
[all laughing]

1283
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:14,963
But, honey... Oh!

1284
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,271
You wanted to talk
about the wedding, right?

1285
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,076
Don't tell me you kept
his umbilical cord.

1286
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,448
Of course not,
that's Greg's foreskin.

1287
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,088
All right, you know what?
That's it. That's... that's
enough humiliation.

1288
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:30,453
Honey, stop.
We're having fun.

1289
00:46:30,524 --> 00:46:31,513
No, I'm not having fun.

1290
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:32,455
Why deny us our memories?

1291
00:46:32,526 --> 00:46:33,515
Because we're done!

1292
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:35,220
[all screaming]

1293
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,318
[sizzling]

1294
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:43,826
Anyone in the mood
for Chinese?

1295
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:46,528
You told me
your first time

1296
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,738
was with the Danish
transfer student
in high school.

1297
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,641
Yeah, well, you weren't
exactly forthcoming

1298
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:53,077
about your engagement
with Kevin.

1299
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,080
Yeah, well,
he wasn't my babysitter.

1300
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,877
Okay, I should have
told you, all right.

1301
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,508
Can we just let
it go, please?

1302
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:01,452
We both got
enough stuff to deal with
this weekend.

1303
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,585
Oh, hi, Jack.

1304
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:08,685
Hello, Greg.

1305
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:09,751
[sighs]

1306
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,024
Funny dinner, huh?

1307
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,227
How do you mean?

1308
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,064
I know that you are
studying my family
like the frozen caveman.

1309
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:18,195
So, I just, I don't want
you to be worried, okay?

1310
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,899
I mean, they're
a little quirky,

1311
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:22,601
but they-they're
well-intentioned

1312
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:24,667
and... and I think
they're just nervous and...

1313
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:27,111
Greg, I am sure tomorrow
will be a better day.

1314
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,545
(Bernie)
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1315
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:30,480
I thought you
ordered room service.

1316
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,847
Are you sure
you don't want

1317
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:33,852
any whipped cream
with your sundae?

1318
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,909
[Roz screaming]

1319
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,046
(Roz)
Bern, stop it!

1320
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:38,216
Who's Bern?
I'm Chad, the bellhop.

1321
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,054
Oh, no, come on,
we did that last week.

1322
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,992
Can't you be
Sam the carpet-cleaning man?

1323
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:44,792
It's illogical.
Why would a carpet cleaner
have whipped cream?

1324
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:45,991
Well, improvise, honey.

1325
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:47,055
Good evening, miss.

1326
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:48,465
I'm here to clean
your carpet.

1327
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:50,366
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1328
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:53,167
Do you mind if I put some
foam down on your rug?

1329
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,571
I don't mind at all.

1330
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:55,665
Good night, Greg.

1331
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:56,766
Okay, sleep well, Jack.

1332
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:59,107
(Roz)
How long... how long have you
worked in this hotel?

1333
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:02,008
It's time to put some snow
on your mountains.

1334
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:03,811
Come on, I'm gonna get
some whipped cream

1335
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:04,873
on those Tetons.

1336
00:48:04,951 --> 00:48:06,748
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1337
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,787
Guys!

1338
00:48:07,854 --> 00:48:09,754
(Roz)
Come back in the morning,
tootsie roll.

1339
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:11,814
(Bernie)
Gay, you see
the cowboy hat on the door?

1340
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:13,257
Cowboy hat is off the door!

1341
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:14,725
No cowboy hat this weekend!

1342
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:16,023
I'm coming in!

1343
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:17,996
Just stop doing
what you're doing!

1344
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,023
Oh!

1345
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,328
Come on, man, you know

1346
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:23,733
what that cowboy hat
on the door means.

1347
00:48:23,804 --> 00:48:25,294
Will you please
help me out here?

1348
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:27,237
What?
We're just being ourselves.

1349
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:28,501
Mom, mom, please...

1350
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:30,270
I think he's saying
not to be ourselves.

1351
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:31,401
Yes, be yourselves

1352
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:32,945
but be yourself in a way

1353
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:35,243
that's a little less than
being your full selves, okay.

1354
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:36,646
(Roz)
I don't understand this.

1355
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,513
I mean, why you're so
afraid of this Jack?

1356
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:40,746
You've been kissing his ass
ever since you got here.

1357
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:42,152
Mom, I'm not afraid
of him, okay.

1358
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:43,246
It's not true.
It is true.

1359
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,553
(Bernie)
I can't believe you went
duck-hunting with him.

1360
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,024
Our people
don't shoot ducks.

1361
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:49,619
Just make Jack feel a little
more comfortable here, okay?

1362
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:51,220
So you don't want us
to be ourselves?

1363
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:53,323
No, I just don't want you
to break his RV, Dad,

1364
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,459
and... and... and reveal
that I had sex with Isabel

1365
00:48:55,535 --> 00:48:58,368
and play weird sex games
that everybody can hear
in the house.

1366
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,462
Mom... Mom, please.

1367
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,564
If you ask me,
it wouldn't be so bad

1368
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,131
if your future in-laws
heard this.

1369
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,199
Do me a favor.

1370
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:06,905
Just don't therapize
the Byrneses
this weekend at all, okay?

1371
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,242
All I'm saying is,

1372
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:09,839
a few minutes
of concentrated work

1373
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:10,974
with him and Dina,

1374
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,882
she could get him
to blow like Krakatoa.

1375
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:15,012
Right, okay, yeah,
you know what?

1376
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:17,355
One day, just give me
one day, okay,

1377
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:18,721
without any complications.

1378
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,692
We get through it,
everybody goes off,

1379
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,489
we go on with our lives.
Can we do that?

1380
00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:23,995
All right.
You got it, dude.

1381
00:49:24,064 --> 00:49:25,258
Thank you, okay.

1382
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,857
Hon, put the hat
back on the door, okay?

1383
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:30,402
No mom.
No cowboy hat this weekend.

1384
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:32,404
(Bernie)
Okay, but tonight
doesn't count.

1385
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:33,767
[Bernie hooting]

1386
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,034
All aboard.

1387
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:36,164
[Bernie laughing]

1388
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,053
Morning, partner.

1389
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:51,479
Morning.

1390
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:53,752
Sleep okay?

1391
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:56,494
I slept all right,
thank you.

1392
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:04,632
It's nice, all of us
being here together,

1393
00:50:04,704 --> 00:50:06,035
don't you think?

1394
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:09,732
Bernard, do you mind
if I have some privacy?

1395
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,370
Almost done.

1396
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,280
Bernie,
this fritatta is wonderful.

1397
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:22,343
What's in it?

1398
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:24,617
Well, a lot of the taste comes
from this old skillet.

1399
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:25,783
I've never washed it.

1400
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,292
Hey, guys,

1401
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,519
can I have everybody's
attention, please?

1402
00:50:29,596 --> 00:50:31,564
Gay, be back in a second.

1403
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:34,090
Okay, Dad. All right.

1404
00:50:34,201 --> 00:50:35,828
Uh, so...

1405
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,497
Mom, I know we've been...
we've been talking about

1406
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:40,836
having the, uh,
wedding in October,

1407
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,898
but Pam and I
have been doing
a little thinkin'

1408
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:44,341
and playing around
with some ideas

1409
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:46,470
and, uh, we're thinking
of moving it up to June.

1410
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:47,570
Nice.

1411
00:50:47,647 --> 00:50:48,636
This June?

1412
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,012
Yeah.
Yeah.

1413
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,278
That's... that's in a month.

1414
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:54,283
I always wanted
a spring wedding, you know.

1415
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:56,845
Well, that's great,
so we can announce it
at the party tonight.

1416
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:57,912
Good idea.

1417
00:50:57,991 --> 00:50:59,015
Wait, what party?

1418
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:00,081
Jack!

1419
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:01,754
Let's play football!

1420
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:03,227
Oh, your father
and I are throwing

1421
00:51:03,296 --> 00:51:04,729
a little
engagement soiree

1422
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:06,390
for you two lovebirds.

1423
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:08,331
Look at that.

1424
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:11,097
(Pam)
That's so sweet.
Thank you, guys.

1425
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:13,469
I thought we were just having
a nice quiet dinner.

1426
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,337
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

1427
00:51:15,408 --> 00:51:17,706
The phone keeps ringing,
the list keeps growing.

1428
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:19,802
Yeah, now,
it's up to 50 Fockers.

1429
00:51:19,879 --> 00:51:22,313
When were you going to tell us
about this?

1430
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:25,613
50 Fockers.
What could be better?

1431
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,412
Dad, what are you doing?
We never play football.

1432
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,422
I'm trying to cement
relationships here.

1433
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,355
Jack said
he was into footy ball.

1434
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,893
Let's show El Stiffo
how we play the game.

1435
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:35,950
Footy ball?

1436
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,462
Come on, come on,
let's play!

1437
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,758
I'm feeling a little tired.

1438
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:40,857
I think I'll sit it out
with Little Jack, okay?

1439
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,561
Honey, you want me to
keep you company?

1440
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:44,126
No, Dina, come on,

1441
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:46,035
you and I will take on
Jack and Roz.

1442
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:49,075
Come on, Jack, it'll be fun,
we'll swap wives.

1443
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:51,975
Don't worry, you'll get her
back after the game.

1444
00:51:52,045 --> 00:51:53,034
[all laughing]

1445
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:54,341
Fine, we'll play
three on two.

1446
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:56,314
But someone needs to be
official quarterback.

1447
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:57,407
Gay goes both ways.

1448
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:58,746
I'll bet he does.

1449
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:00,408
[cooing]

1450
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:03,285
One, two. Hut.

1451
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:08,416
[all chattering]

1452
00:52:24,444 --> 00:52:25,468
Come on.

1453
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:28,139
I'll run a down-and-in,
draw in the defense,

1454
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:30,808
then you'll hit Roz
here in the end zone for a TD.

1455
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:32,977
What do you mean?
He hits me where with a what?

1456
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:35,283
I'll throw you the ball,
you try to catch it, okay.

1457
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,289
You want me to catch?
Yeah.

1458
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:38,346
On two. Ready?

1459
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:39,517
Yes.

1460
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:41,526
Hut one, hut two, hike!

1461
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:42,750
[screams]

1462
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,254
Come on, this way!

1463
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,731
That way, that way,
that way.

1464
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:50,825
[Roz screams]

1465
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:51,893
[laughs]

1466
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:54,500
You remember
that time in the park?

1467
00:52:54,574 --> 00:52:56,166
You remember that time
in the park?

1468
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:58,039
Guys, come on, come on,
cut it out.

1469
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,370
I'm so proud of you.

1470
00:52:59,546 --> 00:53:00,638
I caught the ball.

1471
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:02,477
(Greg)
Mom, come on.

1472
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:03,709
I caught the ball!

1473
00:53:03,783 --> 00:53:04,875
Come on, huddle up.

1474
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:07,112
No, I'm bored. Here!

1475
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:08,586
Dina, come on, let's go.

1476
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:09,713
You want a spritzer?

1477
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:11,552
What? Oh, a spritzer.

1478
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:12,613
That sounds yummy.

1479
00:53:12,692 --> 00:53:14,683
All right, come on.
Dad, you got
to focus, all right?

1480
00:53:14,761 --> 00:53:16,592
He's beating you
down the field every time.

1481
00:53:16,663 --> 00:53:18,028
You want me to
be macho-wacho?

1482
00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:20,965
No. What? Have I ever said
the words macho-wacho
to you in my life?

1483
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:22,331
I got it.
What?

1484
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:23,801
I won't disappoint you.

1485
00:53:24,738 --> 00:53:27,104
Okay, let's try again,
I'm gonna run a stop and go.

1486
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:28,697
Fake the short pass,
then hit me here

1487
00:53:28,775 --> 00:53:30,140
in the end zone
with a Hail Mary.

1488
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,199
Okay, got that.

1489
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:32,608
Yeah, we keep
running that play.

1490
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:34,044
You want to mix
it up a little?

1491
00:53:34,114 --> 00:53:36,241
No, I don't. I've exposed
Bernie's weakness

1492
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:37,783
and I want to take advantage
of it.

1493
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:40,786
Exposed his weakness.
Okay, okay. On four?

1494
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:41,843
Four.

1495
00:53:53,466 --> 00:53:56,094
Just you and me, Jack.
Mano a mano.

1496
00:53:57,036 --> 00:53:59,163
You think you can take me,
Flowerman?

1497
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,605
I'm pretty sure I can,
Mr. Mom.

1498
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:04,374
You're going down,
Bernsie-boy.

1499
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,275
I'm going to
rearrange your bouquet.

1500
00:54:08,815 --> 00:54:10,146
Sell the pump fake, Greg,

1501
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:12,150
'cause that
Focker's gonna bite.

1502
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,457
[inaudible]

1503
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,561
[inaudible]

1504
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:28,089
Hut one, hut two,
hut three, hut four. Hike!

1505
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:54,916
[grunting]

1506
00:54:55,028 --> 00:54:57,724
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

1507
00:54:58,097 --> 00:54:59,257
[screaming]

1508
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:00,321
Shit!

1509
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,889
[chanting]

1510
00:55:03,903 --> 00:55:05,530
Hey, Jack, you okay?

1511
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:07,503
I'm fine, Greg, thank you.

1512
00:55:07,574 --> 00:55:09,735
I see that kind of injury
all the time at the hospital.

1513
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:11,834
I wish you'd let me
give you a quick exam.

1514
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:13,970
No, I'm, I'm fine.

1515
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:16,982
I told you I'll have my doctor
look at it when I get home.

1516
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:18,840
Okay.

1517
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:22,910
You know, it's amazing
how your father anticipated
the pump fake like that.

1518
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:25,583
It's almost like
he knew it was coming.

1519
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:27,381
Hmm.

1520
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:31,325
Well, he definitely takes
competition seriously.

1521
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:34,829
How a man handles himself
on the football field

1522
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:36,892
says a lot
about his character.

1523
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,535
Know what I mean?

1524
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:41,065
Okay.

1525
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:46,442
Hey.
Hey.

1526
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,606
We got him, didn't we,
dude, huh?

1527
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,273
Was he impressed?

1528
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,341
No, Dad, he wasn't.
That was a really hard shot.

1529
00:55:52,418 --> 00:55:53,976
You could've hurt him.

1530
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:55,850
I just wanted it
to be a fun game

1531
00:55:55,922 --> 00:55:57,253
but you wanted to win,

1532
00:55:57,323 --> 00:55:59,154
so, you know,
you got me all steamed up.

1533
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:01,056
No, I asked you to play
a little defense,

1534
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:03,254
I didn't ask you to turn it
into a blood sport.

1535
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:05,559
I play too easy.
I play too hard.

1536
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:07,827
What are you really
asking me to do, Gaylord?

1537
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,664
I'm not asking
anything of you, Dad.

1538
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:11,727
Just... just go down there
and apologize to him, okay?

1539
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:13,499
He thinks it
was a cheap shot.

1540
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:15,473
Sure. Okay.
Whatever you say.

1541
00:56:15,808 --> 00:56:16,797
Okay.

1542
00:56:18,745 --> 00:56:20,042
I can't win with this kid.

1543
00:56:20,113 --> 00:56:21,410
Honey...
(Bernie)
I can't.

1544
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:22,505
It's okay.

1545
00:56:22,582 --> 00:56:24,072
Hi, baby.
Hey.

1546
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:28,113
So, how far along is Pam?
Hmm?

1547
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,479
What?

1548
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:31,820
Come on, honey, I knew it
the minute I saw her.

1549
00:56:31,891 --> 00:56:33,449
Her boobs are bigger.
She's hormonal.

1550
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:35,494
No wine at dinner,
no football.

1551
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,158
She just found out yesterday.

1552
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:39,858
[screams]

1553
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:41,625
Honey.

1554
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,736
My bubeleh's
going to have a baby!

1555
00:56:43,803 --> 00:56:45,270
My bubeleh's
going to be a father!

1556
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:46,498
Oh, my God.

1557
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:48,541
Tell me, talk to me,
so this is so exciting.

1558
00:56:48,608 --> 00:56:49,597
[shushing]

1559
00:56:50,009 --> 00:56:51,704
No.
You didn't tell Dad, did you?

1560
00:56:51,778 --> 00:56:53,211
No, not yet.
He's gonna plotz.

1561
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:54,576
No, no, Mom,
you can't tell him.

1562
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:56,547
Why not?
Because he
can't keep a secret.

1563
00:56:56,616 --> 00:56:57,605
You know that.

1564
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,808
You think Jack knows?

1565
00:56:58,885 --> 00:57:00,785
Are you kidding?
That guy's in such denial,

1566
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,844
he still thinks his daughter
is still a virgin.

1567
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:04,549
Yeah, I know,
he's very old-fashioned.

1568
00:57:04,624 --> 00:57:06,751
That's why Pam
can't tell him
till after the wedding.

1569
00:57:06,826 --> 00:57:08,817
That is ridiculous.
Mom, it isn't, believe me.

1570
00:57:08,895 --> 00:57:10,385
You don't know him like I do.
Fine.

1571
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:11,953
My lips are sealed.

1572
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:14,090
I am so excited
and thrilled for you.

1573
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,759
[laughing]

1574
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,359
So happy for you two!

1575
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:19,738
Did you plan this?

1576
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,501
Uh, no,
it just sort of happened.

1577
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:22,700
How did it happen?

1578
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:23,968
How?

1579
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:26,373
It just happened.
You know... you know
how it happens.

1580
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:28,243
I mean, I'm not going
into the details.

1581
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:29,872
Honey, I love details.

1582
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:32,110
Sorry.
[mumbling]
All right. Okay.

1583
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:33,943
Well, you know, honey,

1584
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,079
many unplanned
pregnancies happen

1585
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:39,488
because the man
is such a sexual dynamo

1586
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:41,954
and the woman
craves his sperm

1587
00:57:42,028 --> 00:57:44,223
on an unconscious
but very powerful level.

1588
00:57:44,397 --> 00:57:46,422
Hmm-mmm. Mom,
I am truly not comfortable

1589
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:48,057
having this
conversation with you.

1590
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:49,294
No?
No.

1591
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:50,802
I've been saying it
since I was 11.

1592
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,996
All right.

1593
00:57:52,071 --> 00:57:54,232
Love you.
Love you, too.

1594
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,637
Uh, Jack!

1595
00:57:56,709 --> 00:57:58,370
What say you and me
go into town?

1596
00:57:58,444 --> 00:58:00,071
I got a guy
who can fix your RV.

1597
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:02,580
I'm in far too much
physical agony, Bernie.

1598
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:03,707
Gee, I'm sorry,

1599
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:05,478
but it'll be good
for you, you know, to,

1600
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:07,109
you know,
to get out and about.

1601
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:10,087
Yeah. Perfect. I can take
the girls shopping
in Coconut Grove.

1602
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:11,350
Little Jack is on

1603
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:12,982
a very specific
napping schedule.

1604
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:14,219
I better stay here.

1605
00:58:14,293 --> 00:58:16,955
No, go. Greg can watch him.

1606
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,222
Yeah, sure.

1607
00:58:18,297 --> 00:58:20,197
He has wonderful
parental instincts.

1608
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:22,791
Dad,
Greg deals with little kids
in the ER all the time.

1609
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:25,429
It's true. They don't call me
Barry Poppins for nothing.

1610
00:58:25,505 --> 00:58:26,995
[all laughing]

1611
00:58:27,073 --> 00:58:28,563
(Roz)
That's so cute.

1612
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:31,075
Why would someone call you
Barry Poppins?

1613
00:58:35,014 --> 00:58:36,276
They wouldn't.

1614
00:59:01,808 --> 00:59:04,538
Now, remember, Greg,
we're Ferberizing him.

1615
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,305
So unless it's an emergency,

1616
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:08,347
under no circumstances
should you pick him up

1617
00:59:08,414 --> 00:59:10,143
or coddle him in any way
when he cries.

1618
00:59:10,216 --> 00:59:11,376
Hmm-mmm. Okay.

1619
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:13,385
He's learning to self-soothe,

1620
00:59:13,453 --> 00:59:15,921
that means no television,
no unapproved toys,

1621
00:59:15,988 --> 00:59:17,046
and most of all,

1622
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:18,454
no monkey business
of any kind.

1623
00:59:18,524 --> 00:59:19,786
Is that clear?
Mmm-hmm.

1624
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,019
No monkey business.
Okay.

1625
00:59:21,094 --> 00:59:22,083
Jack.

1626
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:23,919
Shall we get
a move on, pal-o-mino?

1627
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:25,293
(Jack)
I'm ready.

1628
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:37,674
I love this, Roz.

1629
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,175
This is a great find.

1630
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:40,610
Oh, good,
and it's loose,

1631
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,148
so you can wear it even
if you gain a few pounds.

1632
00:59:43,816 --> 00:59:45,875
Isn't that lovely?

1633
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:47,714
Honey, are you all right?

1634
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:49,186
You look a little flushed.

1635
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:51,485
Oh, it's just the heat.
It takes some getting used to.

1636
00:59:51,557 --> 00:59:53,286
I'm fine.
I'm going to try this on.

1637
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,485
Thank you, Roz.

1638
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:56,695
Now, madame,

1639
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:59,197
let's find something sexy
for the momma to wear.

1640
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:00,958
Look at this little number.

1641
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:02,022
Whoa!

1642
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:04,092
I think this will get
Jack's blood flowing.

1643
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,502
Jack would have a coronary.

1644
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:08,033
I thought so.

1645
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:10,575
Oh, Dina, talk to me.

1646
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:13,803
What's really going on
with that man?

1647
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,075
He seems very uptight.

1648
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:18,607
Jack's always been
a little wound up.

1649
01:00:18,684 --> 01:00:20,549
His job was very stressful.

1650
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:22,718
Being a florist is stressful?

1651
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:24,689
There's more to it
than people think.

1652
01:00:24,757 --> 01:00:25,746
Mmm-hmm.

1653
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:28,985
If you don't mind me asking,
how is your sex life?

1654
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:30,557
[laughs]

1655
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,427
I can't tell you that.

1656
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:34,295
What's the big deal?
I'm a professional.

1657
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:35,994
Dina, I'm a sex therapist,

1658
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:38,536
specializing in
senior sexuality.

1659
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:41,129
I knew those
weren't yoga mats.

1660
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,605
[both laughing]

1661
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:45,576
We're not 25 any-anymore.

1662
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:47,169
But you're not dead, either.

1663
01:00:47,246 --> 01:00:48,645
Lots of couples our age

1664
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:50,443
lack intimacy
in their marriages.

1665
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,040
I didn't say
we weren't intimate.

1666
01:00:52,118 --> 01:00:54,882
There are special occasions.
You know, anniversaries and...

1667
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:58,023
Well, on our anniversary.

1668
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,717
Ay-ya-yay.
<i>Nicht gut. </i>

1669
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:00,816
I beg your pardon.

1670
01:01:00,893 --> 01:01:02,053
Not good.

1671
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:04,892
I think that I can help
you and Jack reconnect.

1672
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:06,189
How?

1673
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:07,390
Well,

1674
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:10,258
it all starts
with a little bit of, uh,

1675
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:13,462
how shall I say,
intimate contact.

1676
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:14,833
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

1677
01:01:14,907 --> 01:01:16,169
My, that tingles.

1681
01:01:21,814 --> 01:01:24,612
I'd give it a shot
with Jack tonight.

What's goin' on over here?

1683
01:01:26,886 --> 01:01:29,047
Nothing,

Jorge, what did I tell you?

1745
01:04:23,462 --> 01:04:24,724
No more tinkering

1746
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:26,458

your science homework.

is out with, uh, rickets.

1750

are... are cured.

Bernie,

1755
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:47,516
I made chimichangas.
You guys want?

1756
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:50,487
Have you ever known me
to turn down a chimi?

I never met him.

Hi, It's me.
How's it going
with the little one?

happened to him.

So I went in and gave him
a little attention. Okay?

for his development.

I'm sorry.
I've never seen people

The truth is,

1880
01:09:46,785 --> 01:09:49,845
you're so concerned about
that Little Jack, but I think

1881
01:09:49,922 --> 01:09:51,446
that it's the
Little Jack in you

1882
01:09:51,523 --> 01:09:52,990
who's crying out for a hug.

1883

Jack, you have issues.

1885

why you run around

with a rubber boob
strapped to your chest.

1887
01:10:03,135 --> 01:10:04,397
Were you ever breastfed?

1888
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,960
Mom, stop.
Key question.

1889
01:10:06,038 --> 01:10:07,130
My guess is no.

Everybody just stop, okay?

1894
01:10:15,514 --> 01:10:17,778
Jack, I am not going
to make any excuses. Yes,

1895
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:20,250
Little Jack wouldn't
stop crying
so I gave him some hugs

1896
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:21,809
and I let him watch TV.

1897
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:24,754
I went to answer the phone,
I was gone a second,
I came back in,

1898
01:10:24,823 --> 01:10:26,984
he let himself out
of the playpen,
he put on <i>Scarface, </i>

1899
01:10:27,059 --> 01:10:29,994

to the rum bottle. Okay?

So I feel much better now.

1903
01:10:37,569 --> 01:10:38,797
Daddy, would you mind...

1904
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:41,806
Please, Daddy. He made
an honest mistake. Let it go.

1905
01:10:41,874 --> 01:10:44,240
He's fine, Greg.
He's asleep.

1906

<i>[Little Jack mumbling]</i>

1907
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:48,005
He spoke.

1908
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,409
<i>(Little Jack)</i>
<i>Asshole. </i>

1909
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:52,172
What?

1910
01:10:53,352 --> 01:10:54,819
Did he say what
I am thinking?

1911
01:10:54,887 --> 01:10:56,286
I think he did.

1912
01:10:57,523 --> 01:10:59,889
Little Jack,
what did you just say?

1913
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:03,022
Asshole.

1914
01:11:05,898 --> 01:11:07,525
His first word?

1915
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,895
It just slipped
out of my mouth. L...

1916
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,570
He has a mind like a sponge.

1917
01:11:15,641 --> 01:11:16,665
That's enough.

1918
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:18,607
I'm calling
a family conference.

1919
01:11:18,677 --> 01:11:19,905
Oh, it's a great idea, Jack.

1920
01:11:19,978 --> 01:11:22,208
Let's finally get
your problems
out on the table.

1921
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:24,306
No, no, I mean with
my own family. Excuse us.

1922
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:26,283
I'd like to talk to
Pam and Dina in private.

1923
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:28,945
Of course, of course,
take your time.

1924
01:11:29,388 --> 01:11:30,412
(Roz)
Come on, honey.

1925
01:11:33,826 --> 01:11:34,850
I'm not so sure

1926
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:36,258
this wedding is
such a good idea.

1927
01:11:36,328 --> 01:11:38,990
To say the least,
I don't like what I'm seeing
from these Fockers.

1928
01:11:39,064 --> 01:11:40,053
What?

1929
01:11:40,132 --> 01:11:42,623
Has Greg ever mentioned
the name Jorge to you?
Jor...

1930
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:44,929
I don't know
what you're talking about.
No, why?

1931
01:11:45,003 --> 01:11:46,595
Because I think
your fiance may have

1932
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:49,368
a few skeletons in his closet
that he is not
telling you about.

1933
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:51,807
And skeletons don't like
living in closets.

1934
01:11:51,877 --> 01:11:53,970
Oh, my God,
Here we go again.
Dad, listen,

1935
01:11:54,046 --> 01:11:56,207
you know,
Greg has no skeletons. Okay?

1936
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:57,646
Oh, really?
He does not.

1937
01:11:57,716 --> 01:11:59,149
Do you know that?
Yes, I know that.

1938
01:11:59,218 --> 01:12:00,515
Will you just...
I'm not a child.

1939
01:12:00,586 --> 01:12:01,575
I see. She knows that.

1940
01:12:01,653 --> 01:12:02,677
This wedding will happen.

1941
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:04,187
And the sooner
you accept that,

1942
01:12:04,256 --> 01:12:06,224
the better it's going
to be for all of us.

1943
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,383
I can't talk to you.

1944
01:12:07,526 --> 01:12:09,357
No.
Wait a second, sweetheart.

1945
01:12:10,662 --> 01:12:14,291
And I'm not so sure Roz
is a yoga instructor, either.

1946
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:17,233
Jack, you promised
that you'd behave yourself.

1947
01:12:17,302 --> 01:12:18,735
And what you said
to those people

1948
01:12:18,804 --> 01:12:19,998
was really hurtful.

1949
01:12:20,072 --> 01:12:22,700
I think you should go up there
and apologize.

1950
01:12:22,774 --> 01:12:25,334
I'm not going to apologize
to them.

1951
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:26,638
Jack.

1952
01:12:30,549 --> 01:12:33,017
A little birdie told me

1953
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:35,178
that somebody's going to
be a daddy.

1954
01:12:35,354 --> 01:12:36,446
Mom!

1955
01:12:36,522 --> 01:12:38,046
Sorry, honey,
but look at that face.

1956
01:12:38,123 --> 01:12:39,351
How could I keep it a secret?

1957
01:12:39,424 --> 01:12:41,551
He's so excited
about being a grandpa.

1958
01:12:41,627 --> 01:12:42,889
(Bernie)
What should he call me?

1959
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:44,519
[both laughing]
How about Poppy?

1960
01:12:44,596 --> 01:12:47,224
You don't have
to have champagne, okay?

1961
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:48,926
Why?
Jack's really angry.

1962
01:12:49,001 --> 01:12:50,161
I know he's mad,

1963
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:51,725
but he's also
a little meshuggenah.

1964
01:12:51,803 --> 01:12:54,033
Come on, honey. How often do
we get to be grandparents?

1965
01:12:54,106 --> 01:12:55,198
We're having a toast.

1966
01:12:55,274 --> 01:12:56,901
Okay, fine,
but, Dad, this is a secret.

1967
01:12:56,975 --> 01:12:58,909
We can't tell Jack
till after we are married.

1968
01:12:58,977 --> 01:13:00,274
Why? We are honest people.

1969
01:13:00,345 --> 01:13:02,245
No! I can't stand
this secrecy anymore. Why?

Why should we diminish our joy

1973
01:13:05,918 --> 01:13:07,545

in denial?

I promised Pam, okay?

1977
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,121
She thinks
it'll break his heart
if he finds out.

1978

1997

and my back went into spasm.

1998

horrific football accident.

You know,

01:14:30,736 --> 01:14:32,931
most back pain
is psychological.

No good, Foxtrot One,
I need a 12-hour turnaround.

2074
01:17:12,264 --> 01:17:14,664
I'll secure the
physical evidence
and the handoff will be

2075
01:17:14,733 --> 01:17:16,997
at Harry Focker's
Good Time Supper Club,

2076
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:18,399
2100 hours tonight.

2077
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,404

<i>Foxtrot One out. </i>

01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,399
Yello?

2080
01:17:24,476 --> 01:17:26,103
Bernie, this is Jack Byrnes.

2081
01:17:26,178 --> 01:17:28,203
Hey, Jack.
Hey, where are you
calling from?

2082
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,338
I'm in my RV.

2083
01:17:29,414 --> 01:17:31,541
Would you have Greg
meet me here in three minutes?

2084
01:17:31,616 --> 01:17:32,605
You're in your trailer?

2085
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:33,776
Thank you, goodbye.

2086
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:34,841
But...

2087
01:17:36,988 --> 01:17:38,148
Hey, Gaylord!

2088
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:40,421
(Bernie)
Jack wants you
to meet him

2089
01:17:40,492 --> 01:17:42,858
in his trailer
in precisely three minutes.

2090
01:17:43,562 --> 01:17:45,496
And I have to
tell you,

2091
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,689
El Stiffo was really
starting to freak me out.

2092
01:17:48,099 --> 01:17:49,532
Greg, wait, okay?

2093
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:51,330
Listen, no matter
how hard he probes you,

2094
01:17:51,403 --> 01:17:53,394
you have to promise me
that you will not break

2095
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:55,462
because I'm not
ready to tell him
I'm pregnant.

2096
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,529
Hey, honey.

2097
01:17:56,608 --> 01:17:57,666
Honey.
What? What?

2098
01:17:57,742 --> 01:17:59,107
Let him probe,

2099
01:17:59,177 --> 01:18:01,008
'cause he's probing
a brick wall.

2100
01:18:03,648 --> 01:18:04,672
(Roz)
Now show me how

2101
01:18:04,749 --> 01:18:06,910
you would like
a romantic evening to go.

2102
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:09,949
Oh, Jack, wine and candles?

2103
01:18:10,021 --> 01:18:11,989
Gosh, it's not
even our anniversary.

2104
01:18:12,057 --> 01:18:13,718
Come here, hot stuff.

2105
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:18,789
[moaning]
Yes, yes. Oh, Jack.

(Jack)
Down here, under the bed.

[bed whirring]

2110
01:18:31,676 --> 01:18:33,075
Down here, Greg.

2111
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:37,541
Wow.

2112
01:18:37,616 --> 01:18:38,674
Have a seat.

2113
01:18:40,652 --> 01:18:42,449
Watch the panel.

2114
01:18:43,688 --> 01:18:45,155
This is incredible.

2115
01:18:56,835 --> 01:19:00,635
So this is like your, uh,
mobile command center

2116
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:03,337
for all your spy activities?

2117
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:06,241
Mainly a secure space for me
to spend some alone time

2118
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:07,801
and reflect on my thoughts.

2119
01:19:07,879 --> 01:19:10,040
Mmm.
Very cool.

2120
01:19:11,082 --> 01:19:12,379
Greg.
Yeah?

2121
01:19:12,717 --> 01:19:14,150
You'll recall,

2122
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:16,653
we had a discussion earlier
in the week
regarding my feelings

2123
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:19,485
about family, legacies,
children and so forth.

2124
01:19:19,557 --> 01:19:21,286
Oh, yeah, of course I recall.
Yeah.

2125
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:25,022
I'm going to
just ask you once.

2126
01:19:26,197 --> 01:19:28,028
Is there anything
you want to tell me

2127
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:30,533
regarding things
that might have happened?

2128
01:19:30,602 --> 01:19:32,627
Unplanned things?

2129
01:19:33,738 --> 01:19:36,798
Things involving
the fruit of your loins?

2130
01:19:40,278 --> 01:19:41,267
No.

2131
01:19:50,322 --> 01:19:53,314
Well, if he's not going
to admit it on his own...

Uh, no, not really.

No?

2152
01:20:48,146 --> 01:20:50,637
Hey, listen, sweetie, did you
tell your mother I'm pregnant?

2153
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,615
Because she keeps touching
my stomach

and
smiling like that.

2155
01:20:54,219 --> 01:20:56,813
Yeah. No, I didn't tell her.
She just, she guessed.

2156
01:20:56,888 --> 01:20:58,048
She what?

2157
01:20:58,123 --> 01:20:59,420
Yeah, and then
she told my dad.

2158
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:00,617
Oh, my God.

2159
01:21:01,393 --> 01:21:03,361
Stop it, Bernie.
Bernie, stop.

It's not funny.

I told my mom.

What?

2163
01:21:07,665 --> 01:21:08,723
Yeah.

What?
Why'd you...

2165
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:11,300
Your dad
will definitely find out.

2166
01:21:11,369 --> 01:21:13,303
She knows my dad.
She'd never say a word.

2167
01:21:13,371 --> 01:21:15,032
No, no.
But he's very suspicious.

2168
01:21:15,106 --> 01:21:16,437
Greg. Hi.
Hey.

2169
01:21:16,508 --> 01:21:19,341
Hi. Honey, would you take this
to your mother?

It's a wine spritzer.

2171

That's all she drinks now.

Yeah, it is.
It's nice.

I met some, um...

Yeah, Dom Focker.

That's my dad's, uh,
first cousin.

Did you meet his kids,
Randy and Horny?

2183
01:21:49,974 --> 01:21:52,875
I've met Randy and Horny.
Yes.

2184
01:21:52,944 --> 01:21:54,878
Come on.
I want to introduce you
to somebody.

2185

Oh, I didn't realize
Isabel had a son.

2194
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:17,329
When did she get married?

2195
01:22:17,402 --> 01:22:18,596
She-she's not married.

2196

Oh, he's never met

01:22:22,273 --> 01:22:23,262
Oh.

2198

Oh, no, no, it's... it's cool.

wasn't like, mature enough

anyway, so, yeah.

2204

Oh, this young man
is quite the mechanic.

2205
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:42,253
And he's only 15 years old.
Isn't that impressive?

2206
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:43,760
Really? You're 15?

2207
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:45,728
Yeah.
That is impressive.

2208
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:47,564
He's a handsome kid, huh?

2209
01:22:47,632 --> 01:22:48,724
Yeah.

2210
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,928

a lot in common.

Is it made with

01:25:15,747 --> 01:25:17,339
You're still in
the circle of trust,

2247
01:25:17,415 --> 01:25:19,815
so I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

2248
01:25:20,151 --> 01:25:21,743
Are you ready to admit

2249
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:24,151
that you've been hiding this
from Pam?

2250
01:25:24,222 --> 01:25:25,712
No, I haven't.

2251
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:27,018
You're not hiding anything?

2252
01:25:27,091 --> 01:25:29,150
No, all right?

2253
01:25:29,661 --> 01:25:31,151
[sighs]
Oh, Greg.

2254
01:25:33,765 --> 01:25:36,529
What are you holding?
What's in your hand?

2255
01:25:36,601 --> 01:25:37,590
Nothing.

2256
01:25:37,669 --> 01:25:39,603
Jack, I can see it
in the mirror. What is it?

2257
01:25:39,671 --> 01:25:41,036
You got something
in your hand.

2258
01:25:41,105 --> 01:25:42,504
Don't worry about it, Greg.

2259
01:25:42,573 --> 01:25:43,938
Is that a needle?

2260
01:25:44,142 --> 01:25:45,700
Yes, it is.

2261
01:25:46,844 --> 01:25:47,970
You seem tense.

2262
01:25:48,046 --> 01:25:49,673
I was going to
offer you a sedative.

2263
01:25:50,715 --> 01:25:51,909
You're joking, right?

2264
01:25:51,983 --> 01:25:53,143
No, I'm not.

2265
01:25:54,752 --> 01:25:55,980
Jack.

2266
01:25:56,054 --> 01:25:57,885
Is that tartar sauce
on your shoulder?

2267
01:25:57,955 --> 01:25:59,047
Tartar sauce?

2268
01:25:59,123 --> 01:26:00,522
[yells]

2269
01:26:03,161 --> 01:26:04,287
Why?

2270
01:26:05,496 --> 01:26:06,758
You've been injected

2271
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:09,026
with a highly concentrated
dose of sodium pentothal.

2272
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,465
Street name: Truth serum.

2273
01:26:10,535 --> 01:26:12,435
You won't recall this
in a few minutes

2274
01:26:12,503 --> 01:26:14,368
and tonight,
for the first time
in your life,

2275
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:15,531
my young friend,

2276
01:26:15,606 --> 01:26:17,665
you are going to be honest.

2277
01:26:19,877 --> 01:26:21,572
Keep the pressure on it.

2278
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,412
Get down, Little Jack.
Get funky.

2279
01:26:27,985 --> 01:26:28,974
Oh.

2280
01:26:29,187 --> 01:26:30,211
Hey there, preggers.

2281
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:31,312
Quiet.

2282
01:26:31,389 --> 01:26:32,515
How're you doin'?

2283
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:33,579
Fine, where've you been?

2284
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:37,526
I went to the bathroom to pee
and now I'm talking to you,

2285
01:26:37,595 --> 01:26:40,086
my fiancee, who I've delayed
marrying for two years

2286
01:26:40,164 --> 01:26:42,530
because I didn't want
our parents to meet.

2287
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:43,827
[cooing]

2288
01:26:43,901 --> 01:26:44,925
What?

2289
01:26:45,002 --> 01:26:45,991
What?

2290
01:26:46,537 --> 01:26:47,697
What?

2291
01:26:48,072 --> 01:26:49,869
You don't like me?
It's okay.

2292
01:26:49,941 --> 01:26:51,875
I don't like your
little red outfit.

2293
01:26:51,943 --> 01:26:54,002
Makes you look
like a little demon-baby.

2294
01:26:54,078 --> 01:26:55,306
Maybe I'll get you

2295
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,972
a little pitchfork
for Christmas, huh,

2296
01:26:57,048 --> 01:26:59,016
so we can put you
on a can of Underwood ham.

2297
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:01,643
I'm sorry that I can't make
little <i>"</i>poop<i>"</i> sounds

2298
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:03,744
and I can't make
little things

2299
01:27:03,821 --> 01:27:05,789
that tell people
when I wanna do things.

2300
01:27:05,857 --> 01:27:07,154
And guess what?

2301
01:27:07,225 --> 01:27:08,522
I can make
a sign to you, too.

2302
01:27:08,593 --> 01:27:10,185
How's that for a sign?

2303
01:27:10,361 --> 01:27:11,419
[all clapping]

2304
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:15,763
Uh-oh. Look, Bernie's gone up
on the stage. Come.

2305
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:18,233
Now, to say a few words,

2306
01:27:18,302 --> 01:27:22,864
one of the great
registered nurses of all time,

2307
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,737
Gaylord Myron Focker.

2308
01:27:24,809 --> 01:27:25,867
[all cheering]

2309
01:27:25,943 --> 01:27:27,274
Come on,
let's give it up to Gay.

2310
01:27:27,345 --> 01:27:28,812
Give it up to him.

2311
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,869
[man hooting]

2312
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:35,885
Bernie Focker!

2313
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:38,285
I love the shirt, Dad.

2314
01:27:38,956 --> 01:27:41,516
Thank you. All right.

2315
01:27:41,893 --> 01:27:44,123
It's great to be here
with all of you

2316
01:27:44,195 --> 01:27:47,892
as I am about to set sail

2317
01:27:47,965 --> 01:27:50,092
in my ship of life,

2318
01:27:50,168 --> 01:27:52,227
with my first mate,

2319
01:27:52,303 --> 01:27:54,533
the beautiful young
blonde lass over there.

2320
01:27:54,605 --> 01:27:55,594
Hey, baby.

2321
01:27:56,474 --> 01:27:57,839
I love you, honey.

2322
01:28:01,446 --> 01:28:02,708
I still masturbate to Pam.

2323
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:03,804
[all gasping]

2324
01:28:03,881 --> 01:28:04,905
Greg.

2325
01:28:04,982 --> 01:28:05,971
What? It's true.

2326
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:07,449
Honey, what?
Come on, you're hot.

2327
01:28:07,518 --> 01:28:08,780
Look at her.

2328
01:28:08,953 --> 01:28:10,818
Look at those boobs. Man!

2329
01:28:11,322 --> 01:28:12,721
I just wanna...

2330
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:14,883
I just wanna lather them up
with soap and just...

2331
01:28:16,227 --> 01:28:17,592
I love it.

2332
01:28:17,662 --> 01:28:20,187
Man, I just wanna... just wanna
nestle in there

2333
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:23,266
and just take
a little vacation in there.

2334
01:28:24,335 --> 01:28:25,768
Honey.

2335
01:28:25,903 --> 01:28:27,370
Honey, what? I'm sorry.

2336
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:29,736
Okay, excuse me
for you being perfect.

2337
01:28:29,807 --> 01:28:31,274
Hey, you know
who else is great?

2338
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:32,899
That woman over there.

2339
01:28:32,977 --> 01:28:35,741
My future mother-in-law,
Dina Byrnes.

2340
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,547
# Dina, Dina, fofina #

2341
01:28:37,615 --> 01:28:39,207
# Banana fana fofina #

2342
01:28:39,283 --> 01:28:41,581
# I love Di-Di-Dina #

2343
01:28:41,652 --> 01:28:43,347
# Byrnes ##

01:28:44,255 --> 01:28:46,052
You know, they say
if you really wanna know

2345
01:28:46,123 --> 01:28:47,283
what a woman
will look like

2346
01:28:47,358 --> 01:28:49,588
when she gets older,
you should look
at her mother.

2347
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,720
Well, I'm a lookin'
and I'm a likin'.

2348
01:28:53,264 --> 01:28:54,288
[Greg whooping]

2349
01:28:54,365 --> 01:28:56,265
Look at her! Sweetness!

2350
01:28:56,334 --> 01:28:57,323
[all mumbling]

2351
01:28:57,602 --> 01:28:58,591
Hmm-mmm.

2352
01:28:58,936 --> 01:29:01,564
Good genes,
the Byrnes gene pool.

2353
01:29:03,074 --> 01:29:04,507
Hey, hey, you.

2354
01:29:05,009 --> 01:29:06,203
Yeah, you.

2355
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:07,299
Hold on.

2356
01:29:07,378 --> 01:29:08,811
Pam,
I gotta tell you something

2357
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,348
about... about this little
dude right here.

2358
01:29:11,616 --> 01:29:15,382
In my first really passionate
sexual awakening,

2359
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:17,920
I did,
in fact, lose my virginity

2360
01:29:18,055 --> 01:29:20,455
to our beautiful housekeeper,
Isabel.

2361
01:29:20,525 --> 01:29:21,992
Greg, honey,
that was in the past.

2362
01:29:22,059 --> 01:29:23,321
So why don't
you come sit down?

2363
01:29:23,394 --> 01:29:25,919
No, no, honey,
'cause I have to get this
off my chest, really.

2364
01:29:25,997 --> 01:29:27,259
Sit.

2365
01:29:29,534 --> 01:29:30,831
We conceived a child.

2366
01:29:30,902 --> 01:29:31,891
[all gasping]

2367
01:29:33,704 --> 01:29:35,433
And his name is
Jorge Villalobos.

2368
01:29:35,506 --> 01:29:37,235
Come up here, Jorge.
Come up here.

2369
01:29:38,209 --> 01:29:40,336
Let's lift
the veil of mystery.

2370
01:29:40,745 --> 01:29:43,441
The fruit of my loins
is right here.

2371
01:29:43,881 --> 01:29:46,577
Everybody take a look.
See his face.

2372
01:29:47,084 --> 01:29:48,176
He's mine.

2373
01:29:48,686 --> 01:29:50,745
Search your feelings, Jorge.

2374
01:29:50,888 --> 01:29:52,515
You know it to be true.

2375
01:29:53,824 --> 01:29:55,086
[speaking in Spanish]

2376
01:30:00,431 --> 01:30:01,455
[sighing]

2377
01:30:01,532 --> 01:30:02,658
It's okay.
I know.

2378
01:30:02,733 --> 01:30:04,291
I know.
Lot of information.

2379
01:30:04,368 --> 01:30:05,460
You let it settle.

2380
01:30:05,536 --> 01:30:06,560
Who'd have thunk it, huh?

2381
01:30:06,637 --> 01:30:08,571
Come on,
give that kid a hand.

2382
01:30:08,673 --> 01:30:09,765
[all applauding]

2383
01:30:10,441 --> 01:30:12,375
Oh, and, uh, Jack?

2384
01:30:13,578 --> 01:30:14,875
Pam's pregnant.

Hey.

(Pam)
Hey.

2392
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:57,350
What happened last night?

2393
01:30:58,289 --> 01:31:01,383
Well, you got drunk
and told my dad I'm pregnant.

2394
01:31:01,459 --> 01:31:02,721
You revealed you have

2395
01:31:02,793 --> 01:31:04,590
a 15-year-old son
named Jorge.

2396
01:31:04,662 --> 01:31:07,222
And, oh, apparently
you have the hots for my mom.

2397
01:31:07,565 --> 01:31:08,793
Oh, my God.

2398
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,865
l... I...

2399
01:31:10,935 --> 01:31:12,562
You mean,
is that really true?

2400
01:31:13,237 --> 01:31:14,727
I think she's attractive.

2401
01:31:14,805 --> 01:31:18,070
No, that you have a son
you never told me about.

2402
01:31:19,076 --> 01:31:20,509
I... Honey, if it is,

2403
01:31:20,578 --> 01:31:22,910
I never heard about it
before last night.

2404
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:25,414
Isabel never
said anything to me. L... I...

2405
01:31:25,549 --> 01:31:26,777
[sighs]
I mean.

2406
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:29,586
I don't even
remember drinking.

2407
01:31:29,654 --> 01:31:31,645
You're telling me the truth,
aren't you?

2408
01:31:31,722 --> 01:31:33,451
Of course, I am.
Pam,

2409
01:31:33,624 --> 01:31:34,750
I love you.

2410
01:31:34,825 --> 01:31:37,293
I would never lie to you
about anything like that.

2411
01:31:41,866 --> 01:31:43,299
I love you, too.

2412
01:31:43,467 --> 01:31:45,560
And if Jorge
really is your son,

2413
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,999
then we will make it work.

2414
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,600
Okay.

2415
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:52,232
I...

2416
01:31:54,545 --> 01:31:57,378
Hey, how did your dad react
to the pregnancy news?

2417
01:31:57,515 --> 01:31:58,743
Well,

2418
01:31:59,784 --> 01:32:01,308
just as you'd expect.

2419
01:32:01,919 --> 01:32:03,409
He slept in the RV.

2420
01:32:03,487 --> 01:32:05,546
He hasn't spoken
to anyone since last night.

<i>we have to leave this island. </i>

2423
01:32:10,461 --> 01:32:12,361
<i>Get in the RV right now. </i>

2424
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,760
<i>Bernard, get out</i>
<i>from under the vehicle</i>

2425
01:32:14,832 --> 01:32:16,322
<i>or I will run you over. </i>

2426
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,697
I'm not moving, Jack.

2427
01:32:17,768 --> 01:32:19,565
There's a non-violent way
to handle this.

2428
01:32:19,637 --> 01:32:20,626
What's going on?

2429
01:32:20,705 --> 01:32:22,070
Well, your father
wants to leave,

2430
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:23,731
and Bernie is staging
a sit-in.

2431
01:32:23,808 --> 01:32:24,934
Dad, come on, get up.

2432
01:32:25,009 --> 01:32:26,067
This is ridiculous.

2433
01:32:26,143 --> 01:32:27,838
You weren't around
in the '60s, man.

2434
01:32:27,912 --> 01:32:29,573
This is how
we got things done.

2435
01:32:29,647 --> 01:32:33,276
<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>Pam, Dina, we have to get</i>
<i>off this island. It's evil. </i>

2436
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:35,375
Jack Byrnes, out of the RV.

2437
01:32:35,453 --> 01:32:37,421
You are acting
like such a jerk.

2438
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,690
Yes, there you go.

2439
01:32:44,795 --> 01:32:46,353
Jacko!
Yes.

2440
01:32:46,497 --> 01:32:48,089
Man, we're gonna
have a grandchild.

2441
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:49,723
Come on,
we should be celebrating.

2442
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,324
How could you not see it?

2443
01:32:51,402 --> 01:32:53,734
Greg is completely unfit
to handle a child.

2444
01:32:53,804 --> 01:32:55,965
He's neglected his own son
for 15 years.

2445
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,769
Hey, Jack, I didn't even know
he existed.

2446
01:32:57,842 --> 01:32:58,866
That's right.

2447
01:32:58,943 --> 01:33:00,410
Who knows what to believe
with you?

2448
01:33:00,478 --> 01:33:01,911
You're dishonest
about everything.

2449
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:04,812
You're so much better, Jack?
Why don't you tell everybody

2450
01:33:04,882 --> 01:33:06,816
what you did last night
to Greg at the party.

2451
01:33:06,884 --> 01:33:07,942
Muskrat, Dina.

2452
01:33:08,018 --> 01:33:09,883
Oh, stuff
your muskrat, Jack.

2453
01:33:10,387 --> 01:33:13,584
He shot Greg with truth serum
before his speech.

2454
01:33:13,657 --> 01:33:14,749
What?

2455
01:33:14,825 --> 01:33:16,452
Yeah,
I found this in his pocket.

2456
01:33:16,527 --> 01:33:18,085
Here we go again, Dad.

2457
01:33:18,162 --> 01:33:21,063
He did the same thing
to Pam's junior prom date.

2458
01:33:21,132 --> 01:33:22,793
Wait a minute.
Yes, yes. Wait a minute.

2459
01:33:22,867 --> 01:33:24,095
You stuck a needle in my neck.

2460
01:33:24,168 --> 01:33:25,726
You drugged my son?

2461
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:28,632
I had no choice.
He refuses to tell the truth.

2462
01:33:28,706 --> 01:33:29,968
Because he's terrified,

2463
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,564
and he thinks
he has to impress you.

2464
01:33:31,642 --> 01:33:33,200
He's had us
trying to impress you,

2465
01:33:33,277 --> 01:33:34,301
but in my opinion,

2466
01:33:34,378 --> 01:33:35,640
Jack, I think it's you

2467
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:37,180
who should be
trying to impress us.

2468
01:33:37,248 --> 01:33:38,647
Jack.

2469
01:33:38,716 --> 01:33:40,877
You've insulted me,
my wife, my son,

2470
01:33:40,951 --> 01:33:42,441
our entire way of life.

2471
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,579
I've sat back and taken it.
But now,

2472
01:33:44,655 --> 01:33:46,316
you've crossed the line, sir.

2473
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:48,483
And I'm gonna have
to kick your ass.

2474
01:33:48,559 --> 01:33:50,117
Dad, dad, wait a second.

2475
01:33:50,194 --> 01:33:53,322
I'm gonna teach this florist
some justice, Focker-style.

2476
01:33:53,397 --> 01:33:54,659
Just calm down.

2477
01:33:54,732 --> 01:33:56,097
Just give me
a minute to stretch.

2478
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:57,896
(Roz)
Bernie,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

2479
01:33:57,968 --> 01:33:59,765
We can talk this through.

2480
01:33:59,837 --> 01:34:01,236
It's too late for words,
Rosalind.

2481
01:34:01,305 --> 01:34:02,567
Dad, Dad, no, no,

2482
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:04,039
please,
no dance fighting. Stop!

2483
01:34:04,108 --> 01:34:05,302
This is Capoeira, man.

2484
01:34:05,376 --> 01:34:06,502
This is hardcore shit.

2485
01:34:06,577 --> 01:34:08,477
Bernard, if you continue,

2486
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:10,103
you will force
me to engage you.

2487
01:34:10,181 --> 01:34:12,012
And once I begin
the sequence of combat,

2488
01:34:12,082 --> 01:34:13,777
it can only end
with your demise.

2489
01:34:13,851 --> 01:34:16,445
Bring it, dog. Come on.
Bring it. Come on.

2490
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,578
He's taunting me.

2491
01:34:17,655 --> 01:34:18,781
Dad.

2492
01:34:18,856 --> 01:34:19,845
(Pam)
Greg!
Greg!

2493
01:34:19,924 --> 01:34:21,755
What, Bernie,
you're gonna snap now?

2494
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:23,451
(Pam)
Greg!

2495
01:34:23,527 --> 01:34:24,459
What?

2496
01:34:25,963 --> 01:34:27,692
Now look what you did.

2497
01:34:27,765 --> 01:34:29,232
It's your fault.

2498
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,790
He's bleeding.
He's bleeding, Daddy.

2499
01:34:30,868 --> 01:34:32,495
That's it. Pam, Dina,

2500
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:33,935
I'm calling
a family conference.

2501
01:34:34,004 --> 01:34:35,096
Come on.

2502
01:34:35,172 --> 01:34:36,332
No, Dad, this is the family.

2503
01:34:36,407 --> 01:34:38,773
All right? In a few weeks,
I'm not gonna be Pam Byrnes.

2504
01:34:38,843 --> 01:34:40,208
I'm gonna be Pamela Focker.

2505
01:34:40,277 --> 01:34:41,539
Or Byrnes-Focker.

2506
01:34:41,612 --> 01:34:42,840
We haven't
totally decided yet.

2507
01:34:42,913 --> 01:34:45,108
No, no, no, I'm gonna be
Pamela Martha Focker.

2508
01:34:45,182 --> 01:34:46,672
I know how that sounds,

2509
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,240
but... but that's
the name I'm taking.

2510
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:50,150
Pamcake, you're upset.
I'm not so sure

2511
01:34:50,221 --> 01:34:51,848
you're thinking
clearly right now.

2512
01:34:51,922 --> 01:34:52,911
I'm trying, Dad.

2513
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:54,548
It's you who
is not thinking clearly.

2514
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:56,616
These two kids
love each other. Look.

2515
01:34:56,694 --> 01:34:59,925
We've been kvelling about
this pregnancy all weekend.

2516
01:35:00,264 --> 01:35:01,993
You knew she was pregnant?

2517
01:35:02,266 --> 01:35:04,029
We all did, Jack.

2518
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:08,930
Daddy, I was gonna tell you
after the wedding, I swear.

2519
01:35:11,108 --> 01:35:13,440
This is the reason I created
the circle of trust

2520
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,842
so we could
discuss these things.

2521
01:35:16,213 --> 01:35:17,680
The circle isn't gonna work

2522
01:35:17,748 --> 01:35:20,308
if you don't trust
anyone that's in it, Dad.

2523
01:35:27,024 --> 01:35:28,082
(Pam)
Dad.

2524
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:29,216
Jack, don't.

2525
01:35:29,293 --> 01:35:31,523
No, Dad.
Daddy.

2526
01:35:31,595 --> 01:35:32,584
(Dina)
Honey.

2527
01:35:32,897 --> 01:35:34,694
Daddy, please.
Daddy, where are you going?

2528
01:35:34,765 --> 01:35:36,323
Jack. Come on.

2529
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,165
[engine starting]

2530
01:35:38,769 --> 01:35:40,259
[all chattering]

2531
01:35:41,372 --> 01:35:43,806
Daddy, come back, please.

2532
01:35:48,612 --> 01:35:49,772
[sighs]

2533
01:35:49,847 --> 01:35:52,213
This is <i>nicht gut. </i>

2534
01:35:57,688 --> 01:35:59,417
[car phone ringing]

2535
01:36:07,998 --> 01:36:09,056
(Roz)
Is it ringing?

2536
01:36:09,133 --> 01:36:10,191
There's no answer.

2537
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:11,859
Well, let's give him
some space.

2538
01:36:11,936 --> 01:36:13,460
Maybe he's learning
to self-soothe.

2539
01:36:13,537 --> 01:36:14,834
Roz.
What?

2540
01:36:14,905 --> 01:36:16,600
This is crazy. I'm going.

2541
01:36:16,674 --> 01:36:17,766
I'm coming with you, Son.

2542
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:18,967
No, Dad, I can do it myself.

2543
01:36:19,043 --> 01:36:20,840
We gotta make up time.
I know these roads

2544
01:36:20,911 --> 01:36:22,776
like the back
of my hand.

2545
01:36:24,081 --> 01:36:26,709
Come on, let's put
this family back together.

2546
01:36:27,584 --> 01:36:29,745
(Greg)
Dad, I know a shortcut.

2547
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,947
It will lead us
to the freeway.

2548
01:36:32,957 --> 01:36:36,154
(Bernie)
I think you make
a right up here or a left.

2549
01:36:36,226 --> 01:36:38,057
It's either one or the other.

2550
01:36:38,128 --> 01:36:39,652
You don't know
where we are, do you?

2551
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:41,061
You know,
something's wrong here.

2552
01:36:41,131 --> 01:36:42,428
This makes no sense at all.

2553
01:36:42,499 --> 01:36:44,296
Dad, it's a map of Detroit.

2554
01:36:44,368 --> 01:36:46,029
Oh, well, that explains it.

2555
01:36:46,103 --> 01:36:47,229
Dad.

2556
01:36:47,304 --> 01:36:48,396
(Bernie)
Punch it, Gay.

2557
01:36:48,472 --> 01:36:49,598
We gotta catch that dude.

2558
01:36:50,407 --> 01:36:52,102
[siren wailing]

2559
01:36:53,544 --> 01:36:54,602
Oh, shit.

2560
01:36:54,678 --> 01:36:56,111
Come on.
Come on. Keep going.

2561
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:58,478
Dad, come on, it's a cop.

2562
01:36:58,549 --> 01:37:00,813
Listen carefully.
Let me do the talking.

2563
01:37:00,884 --> 01:37:02,681
I know how to handle
the local cops.

2564
01:37:02,753 --> 01:37:04,050
No, don't... don't
do any talking.

2565
01:37:04,121 --> 01:37:05,247
Don't shush me,
I'm a lawyer.

2566
01:37:05,322 --> 01:37:06,311
I'm not shushing you.

2567
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,551
You know how many tickets
I've talked myself out of?

2568
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:10,092
Oh, wow.
Will you look at this guy.

2569
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,650
Don't they have
height requirements?

2570
01:37:11,729 --> 01:37:13,196
(Greg)
We're screwed.
No, we're not.

2571
01:37:13,263 --> 01:37:15,561
Don't. Don't, Dad, he said
to remain in the vehicle.

2572
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:20,198
Sir, I said to remain
in your vehicle.

2573
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:22,295
I just wanna talk to you
for one second.

2574
01:37:22,373 --> 01:37:24,534
Let's just talk
like friendly Floridians.

2575
01:37:24,608 --> 01:37:26,337
If you fail to comply,
I will arrest you.

2576
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:28,037
You see, my son's future
father-in-law

2577
01:37:28,112 --> 01:37:29,943
thinks my Gay back there
has a bastard son.

2578
01:37:30,014 --> 01:37:31,038
I said shut it.

2579
01:37:31,115 --> 01:37:32,139
Shut it.

2580
01:37:32,216 --> 01:37:33,808
I know my civil rights now.

2581
01:37:33,884 --> 01:37:35,511
You know your rights? Huh?

2582
01:37:35,586 --> 01:37:36,678
Oh!

2583
01:37:36,754 --> 01:37:38,085
(Bernie)
I have sensitive wrists.

2584
01:37:38,155 --> 01:37:39,179
Excuse me.

2585
01:37:39,256 --> 01:37:40,780
Sir, return to your vehicle.

2586
01:37:40,858 --> 01:37:42,291
I don't know
what he said, but...

2587
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:43,758
That's it.
On your belly.

2588
01:37:43,827 --> 01:37:44,885
On my belly?

2589
01:37:44,962 --> 01:37:45,986
You got a hearing problem?

2590
01:37:46,063 --> 01:37:47,189
No, I'm just trying to say...

2591
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:49,994
Now we have two failures
to comply.

2592
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:52,926
Now, I need the two of you

Meeting Greg made
such an impression on Kevin,

2774
01:45:05,402 --> 01:45:07,427
he spent eight months
in Israel on a kibbutz,

2775
01:45:07,504 --> 01:45:09,028
then he took
an Internet course

2776
01:45:09,105 --> 01:45:11,096

as an inter-faith minister.

01:52:48,097 --> 01:52:49,792
<i>and Pam is pregnant. </i>

2935
01:52:49,866 --> 01:52:51,891
<i>You should've seen the look</i>
<i>on your face, though. </i>

2936
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,935
<i>Oh, so good. </i>

2937
01:52:53,002 --> 01:52:55,402
Asshole.

2938
01:52:55,571 --> 01:52:57,095
[laughing]

2939
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:59,435
<i>Hey, look at me, </i>
<i>Jack, what am I? </i>

2940
01:52:59,509 --> 01:53:00,999
<i>[grunting]</i>

2941
01:53:03,513 --> 01:53:05,447
<i>I am a frozen caveman. </i>

2942
01:53:05,515 --> 01:53:07,312
<i>Study me, Jack. </i>

2943
01:53:07,383 --> 01:53:10,875
<i>Learn how strange</i>
<i>the Focker genetic code is. </i>

2944
01:53:10,954 --> 01:53:13,252
<i>We are weird mutants</i>
<i>who hug and kiss. </i>

2945
01:53:13,323 --> 01:53:15,587
<i>We show emotion. </i>

2946
01:53:15,892 --> 01:53:17,359
<i>Jack must learn from us</i>

2947
01:53:17,427 --> 01:53:19,054
<i>and chip away</i>
<i>with his hammer of truth. </i>

2948
01:53:19,128 --> 01:53:20,561
Ha, Focker.

2949
01:53:20,897 --> 01:53:22,228
<i>Wooga booga. </i>
