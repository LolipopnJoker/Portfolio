Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

749

needed a boogeyman

he worked for the BBC.

But, ironic twist,

it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,

902
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,830
and I wasn't playing
a character at all,

903
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,290

to be the best thing for me.

"How did they get those

1024
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,140

"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting."

those monkeys

bring to the world.

the monkeys were actually...

1034

they were simply acting
as if they were riding horses.
