1
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,072
Be careful, your fingers.

2
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,557
May I help you?

3
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:27,795
This is the Calthorpe.
Private hotel.

4
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,998
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,434
I have a reservation
at the Lancaster Suite.

6
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:37,139
We spoke on the phone
when I confirmed yesterday.

7
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,675
Sorry, don't seem to have
your reservation.

8
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:43,711
Good evening.

9
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,579
I'm Reginald Ormsby,

10
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,815
hotel manager.
Is there a problem?

11
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,784
I'm Mrs. Eleanor Young.

12
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:53,355
My family and I would like
to be shown to our suite.

13
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:55,090
We've had a long flight.

14
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:58,860
We're fully booked, madam.
You must have made a mistake.

15
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:00,628
I'm sure
you and your lovely family

16
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,864
can find other accommodation.

17
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:06,401
May I suggest
you explore Chinatown?

18
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,911
Please, may I use
your phone to call my husband?

19
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:18,481
It's the least you can do.

20
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,282
Mmm.

21
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,724
Mrs. Young,
I must ask you to leave

22
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:30,926
or I'll have to call
the police.

23
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,861
Please, go right ahead.

24
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:38,799
Lord Calthorpe, my apologies
for the disturbance.

25
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:43,771
Eleanor! I just got off
the phone with your husband.

26
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:46,509
Get the Lancaster Suite ready.
Now.

27
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:49,444
Surely you're joking, sir.

28
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:51,612
I assure you, I'm not.

29
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,382
As of this evening,

30
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:55,683
my family's long history

31
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:59,955
as custodians
of the Calthorpe is ended.

32
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:03,058
I'm selling the hotel
to my dear friends,

33
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,559
the Young family of Singapore.

34
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:09,663
Meet the new lady
of the house,

35
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:11,235
Eleanor Young.

36
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,403
Join me for a toast.

37
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:16,073
We'd be delighted.

38
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:23,080
Do get a mop. The floor's wet.

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,221
Get a mop.

40
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,621
I'm all in.

41
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:16,264
Fold.

42
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:17,698
Oh...

43
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,867
Nothing?

44
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:22,272
This whole time
you had nothing?

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,506
All right, so

46
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:28,543
how did I beat T.A. Curtis
so very, very badly?

47
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:31,947
Well, I know for a fact
that Curtis is cheap.

48
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:36,518
So he's not playing
using logic or math,

49
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,353
but using his psychology.

50
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,889
Our brains so hate the idea

51
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,424
of losing something
that's valuable to us

52
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:44,126
that we abandon
all rational thought,

53
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:45,894
and we make some really
poor decisions.

54
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,828
So, Curtis wasn't playing
to win.

55
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,865
He was playing not to lose.

56
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,766
Here.
Put it towards a haircut.

57
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,971
All right,
that's it for today.

58
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,540
Don't forget your essays
on conditional probability

59
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:00,408
are due next week.

60
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,087
Yes! Mmm-hmm.

61
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:14,222
You know what?
You can order your own.

62
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:16,324
Mmm. I'm okay with coffee.
Thanks.

63
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,193
Yeah, well,
you always say that,

64
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:20,128
and then you end up eating
all my dessert.

65
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,329
I don't know
what you're talking about.

66
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:23,465
'Cause I have, like,
a tiny bit.

67
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,933
Uh-huh. Okay.
Can we have one more

68
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,669
of these, please? Thank you.

69
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:31,141
So what about us
taking an adventure east?

70
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:37,179
You wanna get pork buns
in the East Village.

71
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,580
That's what it is, isn't it?

72
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,652
I was actually thinking
of further east.

73
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,987
Like Queens?

74
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:48,722
Like Singapore.
For spring break.

75
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,192
Colin's wedding.

76
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:51,993
We've been dating
for over a year now,

77
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,195
and I think it's about time

78
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:54,996
people met
my beautiful girlfriend.

79
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,698
Come on, I'm Colin's best man.

80
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,534
Don't you wanna see
where I grew up?

81
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:02,003
Meet my family, my <i>Ah Ma?</i>

82
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:04,539
And meet up with that strange
college roommate of yours.

83
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,907
Peik Lin.

84
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:07,475
- Mmm-hmm. Peik Lin.
- She has been begging me

85
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:08,842
to come visit her, you know.

86
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:11,848
The universe has spoken.
It wants you over there.

87
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,516
Come to Singapore.

88
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:17,888
I want the whole island to
meet the brilliant Rachel Chu.

89
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:19,755
Aww.

90
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,966
"If then you have
been raised with Christ,

91
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:40,801
"seek the things
that are above

92
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,704
"where Christ is seated

93
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:46,074
"at the right hand of God.

94
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:49,044
"Set your minds
on things that are above,

95
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:52,047
"not on things
that are on Earth."

96
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,015
Eleanor,
is Nicki bringing a girl

97
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,517
to Colin's wedding?

98
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,019
My Amanda heard it
from her friend Francesca.

99
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:00,555
Eddie says
her name is Rachel Chu.

100
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:03,224
Oh, I thought that
Nick was coming alone.

101
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:05,427
Did you know
he had a girlfriend?

102
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:09,130
Nick dates many girls.
It's hard to keep track.

103
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:10,831
Amanda knows everyone

104
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,901
and she has never heard
of her.

105
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,469
Rachel Chu.

106
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:17,639
Maybe she's from the Taiwan
plastics Chu family.

107
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:20,709
If you want,
I have a private investigator.

108
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,143
Very discreet.

109
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:25,182
I think we should return
to the word of God.

110
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:27,584
Alix.

111
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,619
Ephesians.
Chapter six, verse four.

112
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:34,155
"Bring up your children
in the discipline

113
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,557
"and instruction of the Lord."

114
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,225
Oh, I do hope
she's a good Christian girl.

115
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:38,526
Well,
if he's bringing her home,

116
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:39,794
it must be serious.

117
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:41,031
Exactly.

118
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,202
Oh.

119
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,537
- It's my mum. Do you mind?
- Mmm. Go ahead.

120
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,505
All right.

121
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:52,275
- Save me some of that.
- Okay.

122
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,010
Hey, Mum,
everything okay?

123
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:59,047
<i>Does something have
to be wrong for me to call?</i>

124
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,316
Yeah, usually.

125
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:03,385
<i>Very funny.</i>

126
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,120
Are you bringing
the girl you're seeing

127
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:07,088
to Colin's wedding?

128
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,191
Mmm. We were literally
just talking about that.

129
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:11,926
How could you know?

130
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,865
Everybody knows.

131
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:21,469
Radio One Asia.

132
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:24,472
Move on to Corinthians.
I'll catch up.

133
00:09:24,474 --> 00:09:25,673
Oh, yes.

134
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,209
We're looking forward
to having you home.

135
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:31,679
<i>And your room
is all ready for you.</i>

136
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,281
Thanks, Mum.

137
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,717
But Rachel and I will be
staying together.

138
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,051
I see.

139
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:39,287
Well, I'm having
the house re-done.

140
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,222
And it's not ready for guests.

141
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,691
If Rachel comes, I think
she might be more comfortable

142
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,562
staying somewhere else.

143
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:49,264
All right, sorry about that.

144
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,665
I saved you a piece.

145
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:53,168
You did, did you?
A very small piece at that.

146
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,103
Thank you very much.

147
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,006
How's your mom?
Everything okay?

148
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,675
Couldn't be better.

149
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:02,710
Hey, Mom, this one's kind of
cute. What do you think?

150
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:06,481
No, no! You can't wear that
to meet Nick's <i>Ah Ma.</i>

151
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,950
Blue and white
is for Chinese funerals.

152
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:13,755
Now this, this symbolizes
good fortune and fertility.

153
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:17,492
Great! I was really going for
that "lucky baby maker" vibe.

154
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:19,394
Hey! You're the one
who asked for my help

155
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:20,995
picking out a dress
to meet Nick's family.

156
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:23,531
It's only 'cause I hardly know
anything about them.

157
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,834
Every time I bring them up,
Nick changes the subject.

158
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,502
Maybe he's embarrassed.

159
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:29,704
Maybe his parents are poor,
and he has to send them money.

160
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,040
That's what
all good Chinese children do.

161
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,808
Oh, you're going to have

162
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,343
a wonderful time.

163
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,479
You've always wanted
to go to Asia.

164
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:40,381
And who knows, if all
goes well in Singapore,

165
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,617
you might just come back
with a souvenir.

166
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,552
Oh, Mom, stop!

167
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,554
Nick and I haven't
even talked about that.

168
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,561
I mean, his parents
can't not like me, right?

169
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,797
What was that look?
I saw that.

170
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,967
Nothing. It's just,

171
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,935
Nick bringing a girl
all the way there

172
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,469
to meet them can mean a lot

173
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:03,638
to these overseas families.
They're different from us.

174
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,442
How are they different?
They're Chinese, I'm Chinese.

175
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,979
I'm so Chinese,
I'm an economics professor

176
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,847
with lactose intolerance.

177
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:14,184
Yeah, but you grew up here.

178
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:23,326
You're different.

179
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:25,928
But wearing a lucky color

180
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,998
will make
a good first impression.

181
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:36,204
Okay, game plan.

182
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:38,239
Check our bags,
get through security,

183
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,174
and then we could eat
one of the three homemade

184
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:42,377
Tupperware meals
my mom packed for us.

185
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,045
Good afternoon, Mr. Young,
Miss Chu.

186
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:46,180
We'll take your bags and get
you checked into first class.

187
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,249
- Great.
- Oh. No, there's a mistake.

188
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:51,085
We're not first class.
We're economy people.

189
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,253
This way, please.

190
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:54,656
Just go with it. Come on.

191
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:55,891
But...

192
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:58,295
Yeah, they'll be fine.
Just leave them there.

193
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,132
Welcome aboard,
Mr. Young, Miss Chu.

194
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:06,169
Here's the way
to your private suite.

195
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:09,203
And some champagne.

196
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:13,243
Thank you.

197
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,881
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

198
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:21,549
After takeoff, would you like
to enjoy the lounge chairs,

199
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,318
or should we convert
your suite into a bedroom?

200
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,120
Uh... We're good. Thank you.

201
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,357
Enjoy.

202
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,461
- Nick. We can't afford this.
- Mmm.

203
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,732
These pajamas are fancier
than any of my real clothes.

204
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,467
My family has business
with the airline.

205
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:42,238
The tickets, they're a perk.

206
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:46,674
What kind of business?

207
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:49,377
Real estate, investment,
other things.

208
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:50,812
Nothing interesting.

209
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:51,815
"Dim sum."

210
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:58,887
So your family is, like, rich?

211
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,755
We're comfortable.

212
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:04,394
That is exactly what
a super-rich person would say.

213
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,596
It's not a big deal,
obviously.

214
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:12,734
I just think it's kind of
weird that I had no idea.

215
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:15,004
I mean,
you have a Jamba Juice card.

216
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,939
You use my Netflix password.

217
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:19,574
You play basketball at that Y
that kind of smells.

218
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:21,811
I really like that place,
thank you very much.

219
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:25,213
And yes, my family has money,

220
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:27,082
but I've always
thought of it as theirs.

221
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:28,449
Not mine.

222
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:30,184
I get that.
But I'm going all the way

223
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,854
over there to meet them...

224
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:34,322
Kind of just wanna know
what I'm getting into.

225
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,959
And, you know,
they're your family.

226
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,662
Well...

227
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,196
My family is much like
anybody else's.

228
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:43,665
Mmm-hmm.

229
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,600
There's half of them
that you love and respect,

230
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:47,970
and then
there's the other half.

231
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,472
Which half am I meeting?

232
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,275
<i>Well,
there's my cousin Alistair,</i>

233
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,177
<i>based in Taiwan,
works in movies.</i>

234
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,747
And cut!

235
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,584
<i>He's dating Kitty Pong,
an actress.</i>

236
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:04,855
- Kitty.
- Alistair.

237
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:09,757
You like it?
I was feeling very,

238
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,327
very the emotions.
Can you feel it?

239
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,599
Oh, I can feel all of you.
And all of me.

240
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:31,245
Okay, and what
about your cousin Eddie?

241
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,647
You don't ever talk about him.

242
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,184
Well, Eddie's a big
finance guy in Hong Kong.

243
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:36,519
A real family man.

244
00:14:40,157 --> 00:14:41,289
You know,
if you move,

245
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,657
it will look more natural.

246
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,293
No, this way you get
our optimal angles.

247
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:47,295
Then we're done.

248
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:50,498
Russell, thank you so much.

249
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,266
It's an honor
to be photographed by you.

250
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,036
My pleasure.
People will love it

251
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,871
in the next Hong Kong <i>Vogue.</i>

252
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:58,173
Thank you, Russell.

253
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:01,210
Hong Kong <i>Vogue?</i> I knew it.
Your dress is a disaster.

254
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:03,212
If you wore a Bottega gown,
like I told you to,

255
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,479
we'd be in the American <i>Vogue.</i>

256
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:06,514
You can wear
that gown to Hell, Eddie.

257
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,449
Stop!

258
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,650
<i>Then there's Astrid.</i>

259
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,719
Ah. I remember Astrid.

260
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,856
She's like who I wanna be
when I grow up.

261
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:15,523
Astrid is awesome.

262
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,591
And she's probably
the only one

263
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:17,893
I'm actually close with.

264
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,527
And she's really grounded
and down to earth,

265
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,364
once you get to know her.

266
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:31,006
<i>Not only did she graduate
top of her class at Oxford,</i>

267
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:34,209
<i>start multiple charities,
and is a fashion icon,</i>

268
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:37,714
<i>Astrid has the biggest heart
of any of my cousins.</i>

269
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,150
Mummy? See what I made
for bunny?

270
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:42,418
No, not now.

271
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:51,793
Hi, I'm Astrid.
What's your name?

272
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:52,961
Vita.

273
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:54,497
And who's this?

274
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,265
Bun-Bun.

275
00:15:56,267 --> 00:16:00,135
Well, I think Bun-Bun looks
very dashing with his bow.

276
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:01,369
You have a good eye.

277
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:02,670
Thank you.

278
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,873
Miss Leong, right this way.

279
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,576
It's very nice
to meet you both.

280
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,887
These are all
brand-new from Antwerp.

281
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:22,057
You're the first person
I've shown them to.

282
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:27,597
What are those?

283
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:30,868
Those?

284
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,603
Those are very special.

285
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,906
Burmese pearl drop earrings.

286
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:42,610
Set with emeralds, and rare
pigeon blood-red rubies.

287
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:45,180
They were worn
by Queen Supayalat

288
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:49,352
at her self-anointed
coronation in 1878.

289
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,720
How much?

290
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:55,523
Having you wear
one of my pieces

291
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:58,626
is better publicity
than I can buy.

292
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:02,967
I'll let them go at cost.
1.2 million.

293
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:09,304
So if you have
all this family there,

294
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,439
why are we staying in a hotel?

295
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:13,441
Aren't good Chinese sons

296
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:16,311
supposed to stay
with their parents?

297
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:21,083
Well, because A,
I'm not that good a son.

298
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,720
And B,

299
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,126
I just want you to myself,
just for a bit.

300
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:30,961
That okay?

301
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,431
Okay.

302
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:15,304
God, I can't believe this
airport has a butterfly garden

303
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,471
and a movie theater.

304
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:20,608
JFK is just salmonella
and despair.

305
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,178
Nick! Nick!

306
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:31,721
Araminta!

307
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,723
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

308
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,225
- Rachel.
- Hi.

309
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:38,459
There he is.

310
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,928
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

311
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,829
It's so nice to meet you, too.

312
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:43,999
- Nicki-Nick!
- It's been too long, brother.

313
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,634
It has been too long.
Welcome back.

314
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:47,802
You guys didn't have to
pick us up.

315
00:18:47,804 --> 00:18:49,404
Of course we did. We had to.

316
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:51,873
Of course I had to come
welcome my best man properly.

317
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,442
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hello.

318
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:54,842
Oh! Lovely to finally
meet you.

319
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,078
Nice to meet you, too.

320
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,279
Shall we?
Let me help you with this.

321
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:58,546
Yes.

322
00:18:58,548 --> 00:18:59,982
- These are for you.
- I can grab these.

323
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,482
I know
they're a bit over-the-top.

324
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:02,985
Let's get
you guys localized.

325
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:04,386
- Are you hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

326
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:07,488
So let's eat
everything we can.

327
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:27,976
Welcome to
heaven on earth!

328
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,848
I hope you're hungry.
I am bloody starving.

329
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,654
Guys! Here! Whoo!

330
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:43,025
Come with me.

331
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,326
Each of these
hawker stalls

332
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:45,726
sells pretty much one dish,

333
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:48,030
and they've been perfecting it
for generations.

334
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,098
You know, this is one of
the only places in the world

335
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,135
where street food vendors
actually earn Michelin stars.

336
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:54,970
- Hey! How are you?
- Uncle.

337
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,804
Long time no see, my friend.

338
00:19:56,806 --> 00:19:59,408
Here you go.
Thank you very much, sir.

339
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,411
- Look at this. Look at this.
- My favorite.

340
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,182
Hmm.

341
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:13,488
One of those for you.

342
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,555
Yes, thank you.

343
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:21,729
Looks a little vomity.

344
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:30,272
- Oh, my God!
- Yes?

345
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,640
I told you. Best satay
on the island for sure.

346
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:33,875
So yummy, isn't it?

347
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,844
All right, dig in, guys. Oh.

348
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:37,778
Before I forget,
I need your help tomorrow.

349
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,214
I need to do
some groomsmen stuff,

350
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:41,216
and I don't wanna do it alone
with Bernard Tai.

351
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:42,616
I still cannot believe
that you got

352
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,119
that guy to be your groomsman.

353
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,554
Thank you. Thank you.
I rest my case.

354
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:47,089
Minty...

355
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:50,092
Well, it wasn't up to me,
was it? It's not my choice.

356
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:52,060
Bernard is
the human douche nozzle

357
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:54,795
who used to steal my tuck shop
money when we were kids.

358
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,664
Until Nicki-Nick beat him up.

359
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,467
- Well...
- You beat somebody up?

360
00:20:58,469 --> 00:20:59,868
I threw a single punch.

361
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,204
I fell on the floor
and the guy sat on me.

362
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,340
So, wasn't really
much of a fight.

363
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:07,042
A toast, guys.

364
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:11,113
To my best man, Nick Young,
who can't fight for nuts,

365
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,714
but will always
have your back.

366
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:16,952
- A toast to married life.
- To...

367
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:18,920
- Not yet! Too early.
- Oh, God!

368
00:21:18,922 --> 00:21:20,654
Well, this time
next week, guys!

369
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,059
We gotta get over your
bachelor party first, matey.

370
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:26,094
Is that necessary, man?
Come on!

371
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:29,197
Listen, Rachel,
I know we've only just met,

372
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,199
but it's my bachelorette party
this weekend,

373
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:32,970
and I would love
for you to come.

374
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:35,769
That'll be amazing.

375
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,805
- Thank you so much!
- Good! Good!

376
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:39,174
- Am I out of the picture?
- Thanks, man.

377
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,674
Am I totally
out of the picture?

378
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:41,675
Yes, I've replaced you
with Bernard.

379
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,311
Screw that man!

380
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,947
Also, I have to say,

381
00:21:45,949 --> 00:21:49,584
I can't remember the last time
I saw Nick like this.

382
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:51,021
That's funny, though.

383
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,289
He's just happy to be home.

384
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,826
Oh, yeah,
he's just happy to be home.

385
00:21:57,561 --> 00:21:59,827
With you.

386
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,695
Your dad
will be the death of you.

387
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:02,830
My dad
will be the death of me.

388
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:04,134
Oh, cheers to that.

389
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:08,970
Guys, we have to dig in

390
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:10,738
'cause this crab
is not gonna eat itself.

391
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,307
What should I try first?

392
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:14,590
- Try some of this. Thank you.
- Do you want some of this?

393
00:22:15,078 --> 00:22:16,878
- It's really spicy.
- It is really spicy.

394
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:56,952
Whoo!

395
00:22:56,954 --> 00:23:00,188
Nick's in Singapore!

396
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,892
It's good to be home.

397
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,566
- Is Michael here?
- Not yet, ma'am.

398
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:14,269
Also, your son woke up.
He wants to see you.

399
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,736
All right.

400
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:18,573
You know what to do. Quickly.

401
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:13,995
I'm sorry.
Got stuck in a meeting.

402
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:15,397
It's okay. I get it.

403
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,598
But don't forget,

404
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,798
wedding festivities
start on Wednesday,

405
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,334
so no emergencies next week.

406
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:20,402
I know.

407
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:22,203
Wouldn't dream
of missing a second

408
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:23,972
with your family
and their friends.

409
00:24:23,974 --> 00:24:25,540
Come on, it won't be all bad.

410
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,475
Nick and his new girlfriend
will be there.

411
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:28,677
You'll like her.

412
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,111
Oh, yeah?

413
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:33,748
Why? 'Cause she's a commoner
like me?

414
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,419
You know
that's not what I meant.

415
00:24:35,818 --> 00:24:37,852
Ooh.

416
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:40,722
You know, I thought
I caught the maids

417
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:45,160
trying to shove a pair
of Jimmy Choos behind a dryer.

418
00:24:45,162 --> 00:24:47,395
Yeah, I don't know
why you bother

419
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:49,698
trying to hide
your shopping from me.

420
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,965
You can buy whatever you want.

421
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:54,502
I get it.
Besides, everybody knows

422
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,504
you wear the money pants
in this family.

423
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:59,343
Pants are overrated.

424
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:03,380
Oh, I got you something, too.

425
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:10,985
To celebrate
the launch of your startup.

426
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:13,021
I know you don't like
expensive gifts,

427
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:15,123
but you're not a captain
in the army anymore.

428
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:18,395
You're a CEO.
You should look the part.

429
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,469
I...

430
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:31,441
I love it. Thank you.

431
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:04,339
What time is it?

432
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,807
Morning.

433
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:08,710
I'm afraid it's time for me
to do some groomsman duties.

434
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:12,046
Stay in bed.

435
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:14,684
You stay here.
I'll get you a breakfast tray.

436
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,659
You know what?
I should get up, too.

437
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,162
I told Peik Lin I would
meet up with her today.

438
00:26:27,164 --> 00:26:28,730
Ah, a little college reunion.

439
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,532
But don't forget.
Dinner at <i>Ah Ma's</i> tonight.

440
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:32,066
The whole family's
gonna be there.

441
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,204
- Yes.
- I can't wait to show you off.

442
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:39,176
Hubba, hubba.

443
00:26:39,776 --> 00:26:40,942
How can I resist?

444
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:42,410
Ooga-ooga.

445
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:44,779
You put those glasses on
on purpose.

446
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:12,774
New York in the house!

447
00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,377
Yeah! Yeah!

448
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:16,311
Peik Lin!

449
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:20,114
What up, bitch? Yeah!

450
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,116
Oh, my God! You look amazing.

451
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,285
I know. Some things
never change, right?

452
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:27,188
And this is quite a place.

453
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,658
Astor!
Vanderbilt! Rockefeller!

454
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,963
Naughty, naughty boys.
Stop barking.

455
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:36,130
- Hey, Rachel!
- Hi!

456
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:39,902
Singapore is so hot. Come in
and enjoy the aircon. Come on.

457
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:43,304
Whole family waiting to
meet you. Very excited.

458
00:27:43,306 --> 00:27:46,808
Rachel, welcome, welcome.

459
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,510
Wow! Oh, my gosh!

460
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:51,312
Your house is amazing,
Mrs. Goh.

461
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:57,920
Call me Auntie. Auntie Neenah.

462
00:27:57,922 --> 00:27:59,320
Sorry. Auntie Neenah.

463
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:01,162
Oh, yeah.

464
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,594
We were inspired by

465
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:10,098
the Hall of Mirrors
in Versailles.

466
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,066
And Donald Trump's bathroom.

467
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,135
- Really?
- Yeah.

468
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:15,470
You like it or not?

469
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:20,744
Oh, yes.
The gold is very brilliant.

470
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,017
Rachel Chu, we are so grateful

471
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,485
for all the help
you have given

472
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:34,389
my Peik Lin
back in her uni days.

473
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:37,425
I mean, without you,
she would be a hot mess.

474
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:39,694
Oh, my God, no.
Actually,

475
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:41,429
if it wasn't for her,
I'd be a big mess.

476
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,300
She was a huge help
to me in college.

477
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:46,035
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Goh.

478
00:28:46,037 --> 00:28:49,704
Nice to meet you, too, Chu.

479
00:28:49,706 --> 00:28:55,443
Ku-ku. Ku-Chu. You. Poo-poo.

480
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:57,012
No, I'm just kidding.

481
00:28:57,014 --> 00:28:58,446
I don't have an accent.

482
00:28:58,448 --> 00:28:59,714
I'm just messing with you.

483
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,549
No, I studied
in the States, too.

484
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:03,384
Yeah, Cal State Fullerton.

485
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:05,386
- I majored in Thought.
- Mmm.

486
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:07,789
Don't stand
on ceremony, Rachel.

487
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,390
This is simple food, <i>lah.</i>

488
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:12,360
Ah, cha, cha, cha!
Don't be shy.

489
00:29:12,362 --> 00:29:14,228
- Oh. Thank you.
- You're not a model.

490
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,597
I'm definitely not.

491
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,099
No, you're not.
Not at all. Far from it.

492
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:19,267
I know.

493
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,036
Make sure you eat it all.

494
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:22,670
'Cause I'm watching you.

495
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:24,706
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, yeah.

496
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,375
- <i>Ah Pa,</i> can we go trampoline?
- ...go trampoline?

497
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,644
You haven't finished
your nuggets yet, sweetie.

498
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:30,980
Okay, there's
a lot of children

499
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,848
starving in America, right?

500
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,617
I mean, take a look at her.
She's American, huh?

501
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,585
Really skinny.
You wanna look like that?

502
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:38,519
No.

503
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:39,857
Then eat your nuggets!

504
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:44,059
So, Rachel,
what you do in America?

505
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,326
Um...

506
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:48,696
- I'm an economics professor.
- Wow.

507
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:52,901
Very impressive.
Econ professor, eh?

508
00:29:52,903 --> 00:29:56,504
Wow, you must be very smart.
Good for you.

509
00:29:56,506 --> 00:29:57,772
Let me get this straight.

510
00:29:57,774 --> 00:29:59,641
You both went
to the same school,

511
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:02,543
yet someone came back
with a degree that's useful.

512
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:05,649
And the other one came back
as Asian Ellen.

513
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:12,121
Psst, P.T.

514
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:13,821
Hmm?

515
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:14,990
Look over here.

516
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:16,557
She's a hottie.

517
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,927
This is the kind of girl
you should date.

518
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,998
Smart, beautiful.
Not those like K-Pop skanks

519
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,102
with no brain,
big eyes and small backsides.

520
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,203
She has an amazing backside.

521
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:31,506
This is Goh standard.

522
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:33,876
Don't be shy.
Just talk to her.

523
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:35,010
I love you.

524
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:36,711
Okay. No, just, uh...

525
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,346
Pa, she's here
with her boyfriend.

526
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,416
I don't see no ring
on her finger.

527
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,851
Well,
my boyfriend's actually

528
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,519
from Singapore
and that's why we're here.

529
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:46,554
We're here to go
to his best friend's wedding,

530
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:48,556
where he's gonna be
the best man.

531
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,425
- Hmm.
- What's his name?

532
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:53,494
This is a very small island.
Maybe we know his family.

533
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:54,932
His name is Nick Young.

534
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:04,672
Uh...

535
00:31:04,674 --> 00:31:06,476
The Nick you're dating
is Nick Young?

536
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,411
His best friend...

537
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,881
You're invited
to Colin Khoo's wedding, ah?

538
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:15,884
Yeah. You guys
know them or something?

539
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:17,318
Hells yeah.

540
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,786
The Khoos, the Youngs...

541
00:31:18,788 --> 00:31:20,956
I mean, who doesn't know
who they are?

542
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,790
They're just
the biggest developers...

543
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,826
...in all of Singapore.

544
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:28,396
And Malaysia, Thailand,
Brunei, New Mexico.

545
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:29,597
She gets it.

546
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,299
Colin and Araminta's wedding

547
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,401
is Singapore's
event of the century.

548
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,636
The Youngs are like royalty.

549
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:37,438
Did you not know?
Does she not know?

550
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,574
Why you never
say before?

551
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:42,510
Tell, tell,
what are they like?

552
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:45,047
I don't really know
what they're...

553
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:47,348
I haven't met them yet.
I'm gonna meet them tonight.

554
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,750
I'm going to
Nick's grandma's house.

555
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:52,253
You're going to Nick's
grandma's house wearing this?

556
00:31:52,255 --> 00:31:53,755
Wearing that?

557
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:00,528
No way. No way.

558
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,363
Yeah, I thought
red was a lucky color, right?

559
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:06,601
Yeah. If you're an envelope.
Zing! Nailed it!

560
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:09,004
Zing!

561
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:11,506
Rachel, these people
aren't just rich, okay?

562
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:13,841
They're crazy rich. Look.

563
00:32:13,843 --> 00:32:15,443
There's new money
all over Asia.

564
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:16,577
We got
the Beijing billionaires,

565
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:18,046
the Taiwan tycoons...

566
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:20,249
But the Young family,
they're old-money rich.

567
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:23,684
They had money when
they left China in the 1800s.

568
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:26,855
And they went
all the way down here.

569
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:29,524
Not there... Here.

570
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:31,059
They came to Singapore

571
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,627
when there was nothing
but jungle and pig farmers.

572
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:34,196
There was a snake here,
eating an apple.

573
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:36,764
You know what I mean?
And they built all of this.

574
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,299
Now, they're the landlords

575
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,068
of the most expensive city
in the world. Here you go.

576
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,405
These people are so posh
and snobby, they're snoshy.

577
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:45,706
Here you go.

578
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,308
Yeah,
but Nick's not like that.

579
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,310
Even if he isn't,
I guarantee you the family is.

580
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:50,578
Which is why tonight,

581
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,579
you need to not look
like Sebastian

582
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:52,713
of <i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

583
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:54,283
You know, the little crab guy?

584
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:00,255
Look at this guy,
he's sleeping.

585
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:01,722
Come on,

586
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,391
this isn't
your grandma's road.

587
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:05,127
God damn it!

588
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:06,561
Thank you for driving me.

589
00:33:06,563 --> 00:33:08,429
Duh. This is like
my one chance to see

590
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:10,431
- the Young family mansion.
- Mmm.

591
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:18,840
<i>At the next intersection,</i>

592
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:20,010
<i>make a U-turn.</i>

593
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,110
<i>Make a U-turn.</i>

594
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:23,879
Are you sure
you gave me the right address?

595
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:25,546
The GPS says there's, like,
nothing here.

596
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:27,383
Like, literally nothing.

597
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:33,721
I don't know
why we're here.

598
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:36,258
I mean,
I put in the exact address.

599
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,759
- You copied and you pasted it?
- Yeah.

600
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:39,995
Did you just
copy and paste "jungle"

601
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:41,864
and just kind of
threw it in there?

602
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:43,298
- No. This is the address...
- Because I feel like that's...

603
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,566
You actually used the...
Okay! All right.

604
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:48,203
That's a...
Uh, hi! So we'll just...

605
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:51,839
Hello, sir. How are you?

606
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:53,909
We're here for the party,
and we're...

607
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,776
We come in peace.

608
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:58,546
Do you know where
the Young family house is?

609
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:00,615
Nicholas Young?
I'm Rachel Chu.

610
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:03,051
I'm here to go
to his family dinner.

611
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:06,787
Uh, Rachel Chu for the list.
If there is a list.

612
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:08,756
He's on the phone.
He's on the phone.

613
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:10,893
Is that a gun knife?
It's a knife gun.

614
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:14,831
Okay, and there's a friend.
Hi! Very nice to...

615
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,368
We can go through?
We're going through? Okay.

616
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,571
- Don't stab the car.
- Okay.

617
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:28,178
Okay, okay. Thank you, bye!

618
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:53,101
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

619
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:57,039
Beautiful? It's 200 mil
worth of real estate.

620
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,076
It's spectacular.

621
00:35:26,703 --> 00:35:31,106
Damn, Rachel.
He's like the Asian <i>Bachelor.</i>

622
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:32,242
Thanks, brother.

623
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:38,916
Hello, gorgeous.

624
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:48,522
Wow! I think I've just fallen
in love with you

625
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,693
all over again.

626
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:58,467
Rachel!

627
00:35:58,469 --> 00:35:59,600
I missed you, too.

628
00:35:59,602 --> 00:36:01,436
- Yeah?
- What did you get up to?

629
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:03,537
Psst! Rachel!

630
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,507
Oh, uh, this is my friend,
Peik Lin.

631
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:07,876
- Hi, there.
- Howdy.

632
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:09,111
Thank you very much
for bringing Rachel.

633
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:10,145
Oh, no worries.

634
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,913
Do you wanna stop by
for some dinner?

635
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,382
- Oh, no, I couldn't impose.
- No, it's not a problem.

636
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:14,782
- I had some dinner plans.
- Seriously, we've got...

637
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:16,186
Yeah, I'll fucking come
to dinner.

638
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:21,822
- I missed you.
- Did you?

639
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,524
- Yes.
- How was your day?

640
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,494
It was fun!
I got to meet

641
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:27,697
Peik Lin's whole family,
her dog.

642
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,869
Nope.

643
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:36,338
You have a cocktail dress
in your trunk?

644
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,772
I'm not an animal, Rachel.

645
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:45,546
I thought
this was just a family thing.

646
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:48,483
My grandmother's invited some
of her friends over tonight.

647
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:51,719
Her <i>tan huas</i> are blooming.
It's a whole thing.

648
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:53,223
You ready for this?

649
00:36:56,759 --> 00:37:00,328
Oh, damn, Nick.
It's a party though. Okay.

650
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,641
The good bathrooms
are up the stairs,

651
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:15,110
and you can
get changed in there.

652
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:17,780
Okay, good, I'll find it.
Thank you.

653
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:30,825
You know,
when you said you grew up

654
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,626
in your grandma's house,

655
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,696
I wasn't expecting this.

656
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:37,199
Thank you.

657
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:40,969
Oh, no, no.
Those are for your fingers.

658
00:37:40,971 --> 00:37:42,537
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

659
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,306
A little bit much, I know.

660
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:46,441
I mean,
this place is gorgeous.

661
00:37:46,443 --> 00:37:48,009
And like
the rolling green hills.

662
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:51,480
I mean, there are
armed guards out there.

663
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:52,848
And a giant tiger.

664
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,817
Okay.

665
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:58,253
That is Mr. Harimau.

666
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:00,621
Now, my great-grandfather
actually shot him

667
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:02,257
when he ran into the house.

668
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:06,328
But Astrid and I, we used to
hide cigarettes in his paws.

669
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,728
Do you wanna head in?

670
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,898
Actually, I wanted to
bring you over

671
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,335
- to my mum first.
- Oh.

672
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:13,270
Come on.

673
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:55,412
Mum.

674
00:38:58,348 --> 00:39:00,916
You need a haircut.
So unkempt.

675
00:39:00,918 --> 00:39:02,716
And you look tired
from your trip.

676
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,819
I'm gonna ask the cook
to make you some herbal soup.

677
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:09,424
I'll send it
to the hotel later.

678
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:12,093
Mum, this is Rachel Chu.

679
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:15,729
Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy
to meet you, Mrs. Young.

680
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:18,033
Or Auntie. Right?

681
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:21,102
I'm learning
the lingo.

682
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:23,338
I'm very glad
to finally meet you, too.

683
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,839
And I'm sorry Nick's father
couldn't be here.

684
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,909
He was called to business
in Shanghai.

685
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:31,346
I told Rachel when duty calls,
Dad answers.

686
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:32,414
As it should be.

687
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,516
Nick tells me
you're a professor, too.

688
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,884
What do you teach?

689
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:37,419
Um, I teach economics.

690
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:40,457
And she's brilliant.
NYU's youngest faculty member.

691
00:39:44,528 --> 00:39:46,094
So, economics...

692
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:47,662
Sounds challenging.

693
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:49,397
Are your parents
academics as well?

694
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:53,034
No. Well, my dad actually died
before I was born,

695
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:55,170
and my mom
didn't even go to college.

696
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:57,005
She actually hardly spoke
any English

697
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:59,241
when she immigrated
to the United States.

698
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:01,809
But she worked really hard,
and she studied,

699
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:03,511
and she earned
her real estate license

700
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:05,981
while she was waiting tables
to support us.

701
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:07,449
Now, she likes to say

702
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,118
that she's Flushing's
top real estate broker.

703
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:15,690
Self-made woman.
She must be so proud of you.

704
00:40:15,692 --> 00:40:18,093
Well, she knows that I'm
passionate about what I do,

705
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:19,863
and she's always
wanted that for me.

706
00:40:21,198 --> 00:40:25,267
Pursuing one's passion.
How American.

707
00:40:25,269 --> 00:40:27,969
Well, your mother's
very open-minded,

708
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:29,571
not like here,

709
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,239
where parents are obsessed

710
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:33,208
with shaping the life
of their children.

711
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:36,645
That's dinner.

712
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:37,846
Go ahead.

713
00:40:37,848 --> 00:40:39,180
I'll be out in a minute.

714
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:41,716
Rachel, it was lovely
meeting you.

715
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:44,986
Thank you. You, too.

716
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:46,787
Okay, she hates me.

717
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,690
She takes a little minute
to warm up,

718
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:50,861
- but we'll get there.
- A minute?

719
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,443
- Nicki! Rachel!
- Astrid.

720
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,077
Hey. Good to see you.

721
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,211
I'm so glad you could make it.

722
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:11,680
- Michael.
- Nick.

723
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,214
Astrid. So good
to see a face I know.

724
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,849
This is my husband, Michael.

725
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:17,052
Nice to meet you.
Heard so much about you.

726
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,420
Nice to meet you, Michael.

727
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:21,556
Hey, the golden boy's back!
Nick!

728
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:23,824
And you must be Rachel.

729
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:25,860
I'm Edison Cheng.
This is my wife.

730
00:41:25,862 --> 00:41:27,295
- Hi. I'm...
- Her name is Fiona.

731
00:41:27,297 --> 00:41:29,097
So I see you've already met
Princess Astrid

732
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,533
and her little
soldier toy-boy, Mikey.

733
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:33,735
You know, Mikey is a big-shot
tech startup guy.

734
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:35,136
So if you forget
your password,

735
00:41:35,138 --> 00:41:36,671
he's your man.

736
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:40,175
So you're from the Taiwan
plastic Chus, right?

737
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:42,944
Can I punch him in the face?
Just once.

738
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:44,212
Take a number.

739
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:47,415
I'll be in my usual corner.
Champagne?

740
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,985
Thank you.

741
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:56,825
So, have you prepped Rachel
to face the wolves?

742
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:58,493
Rachel is a New Yorker.

743
00:41:58,495 --> 00:42:01,262
She lectures millennials
for a living.

744
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:03,331
I think she'll manage
our family.

745
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,767
You've been away too long.

746
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,235
Okay, sorry, time out.

747
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:09,404
So you're not
from a Taiwan Chu family?

748
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:10,739
Nope.

749
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:12,307
Hong Kong telecom Chus?

750
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:13,241
No.

751
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:15,210
Malaysian packing peanut Chus?

752
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:16,678
Is that really a thing?

753
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,613
- Yeah, it's everywhere.
- I'm gonna stop you there

754
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:20,315
because I'm gonna take her
on the rounds.

755
00:42:20,317 --> 00:42:22,317
- We'll be back, though.
- No, wait. Hang on.

756
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,320
China instant noodle Chus.
Rachel,

757
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:28,158
Chu are you?

758
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:31,395
Ugh. Let's go.

759
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:36,931
This is Auntie Alix
and Auntie Felicity.

760
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:38,800
Hi!
It's so nice to meet you.

761
00:42:38,802 --> 00:42:41,636
I've never been
to a <i>tan hua</i> party before.

762
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:43,938
We love any excuse
to throw a soiree.

763
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,040
Do your parents like
to entertain?

764
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:49,045
Oh. I'm sorry.
Your mother's single.

765
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:51,012
Yup.

766
00:42:51,014 --> 00:42:52,313
Auntie Jacqueline.

767
00:42:52,315 --> 00:42:53,715
One of my parents'
oldest friends.

768
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:57,018
I actually met Nick's father
at Cambridge.

769
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,954
So, what line of work
is your father in?

770
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:02,157
Oh, my father died
before I was born.

771
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,126
But he was a factory worker
in China.

772
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:22,177
This is Ling Cheh,

773
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:24,214
my old nanny.

774
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:32,120
Look, now's the time
we need all hands on deck.

775
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:34,289
Please, please,
just do me this favor.

776
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,059
Thank you. Bye-bye.

777
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:39,727
They started
clearing away dinner.

778
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,364
Your favorites.

779
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:44,534
Thank you.

780
00:43:46,636 --> 00:43:48,570
You know if you need
bodies at the office,

781
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:50,340
I could always come in
and help out.

782
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:54,309
The glamorous Astrid Leong

783
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:57,812
- working as an assistant?
- Mmm-hmm.

784
00:43:57,814 --> 00:44:02,484
Wait, isn't Araminta's
bachelorette party tomorrow?

785
00:44:02,486 --> 00:44:06,020
And this will be the perfect
excuse to get out of it.

786
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:08,389
Thank you. Really.

787
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,427
But I've got
everything covered.

788
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:12,762
Okay.

789
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:15,396
I forgot to get you a fork.

790
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:17,501
It's okay, you stay.
I'll go get it.

791
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:29,346
Michael,
I think it's the office.

792
00:44:44,794 --> 00:44:47,863
Oh, my God! Nick, I can't
believe I just did that.

793
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:49,697
It's fine. I don't think
anybody even noticed.

794
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,599
I think I freaked out
your nanny...

795
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,835
Oh, my God!

796
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:55,169
So sorry.

797
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:56,204
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

798
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:57,605
Can I have a tissue please?

799
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:00,241
Go, go. Get changed.
I'll keep Rachel company.

800
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:02,243
Thank you, Oli.
You're in good hands.

801
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:03,611
Give me two minutes.
I'll change.

802
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:05,148
Sorry.

803
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:08,049
Hi, I'm Rachel.

804
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:09,684
Oh, I know.

805
00:45:09,686 --> 00:45:11,686
Rachel! Rachel!

806
00:45:11,688 --> 00:45:13,623
I heard you thought
<i>Ah Ma</i> was the cook!

807
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:16,524
Ahh!

808
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:19,260
On the bright side,
you're the talk of the party.

809
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:20,828
People like your dress.

810
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,931
Oh, I did that.

811
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:23,131
- Oh.
- I know!

812
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,034
Such a chic '70s goddess.

813
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:26,467
I know.

814
00:45:26,469 --> 00:45:28,436
It's very disco Cleopatra,
but in a good way.

815
00:45:28,438 --> 00:45:29,972
That's exactly
what I was going for.

816
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:32,607
Oh, well. Oliver.

817
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:34,275
- Hi.
- I like your shoes.

818
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:36,011
Oh, thank you.
I'm Peik Lin. Ditto.

819
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:37,412
- Cheers.
- There you go.

820
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:38,881
Gosh, these are lovely.

821
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:39,949
They're clip-ons. Thank you.

822
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,583
Are they? Oh, wow!

823
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,585
So, Oliver,
are you a cousin, too?

824
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:47,022
Mmm. Well, I'm one of
the poorer relations.

825
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,592
The rainbow sheep
of the family.

826
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:51,092
But I make myself useful.

827
00:45:51,094 --> 00:45:53,194
Whatever the Youngs want,
I procure.

828
00:45:53,196 --> 00:45:56,197
Golden koi fish,
Huanghuali furniture.

829
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:57,732
A rare Cambodian gong.

830
00:45:57,734 --> 00:46:00,704
Why would they want to buy
a rare Cambodian gong?

831
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:05,475
Because they can.

832
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,982
<i>Ah Ma</i> insists
all your clothes be washed

833
00:46:12,984 --> 00:46:14,784
and pressed every two weeks.

834
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:18,854
This one.

835
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:22,158
Everything is exactly
as I left it.

836
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:32,300
Looking for your cigars?

837
00:46:32,302 --> 00:46:34,804
I had them thrown out
years ago.

838
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:39,173
Never could get
anything past you, could I?

839
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,946
I keep telling <i>Ah Ma</i>
to put your things away,

840
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:45,279
but she says this room

841
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:47,317
makes her feel
like you're still here.

842
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:51,452
Well, I got an earful

843
00:46:51,454 --> 00:46:54,224
when you didn't move back
last year.

844
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:58,226
Your father and I were really

845
00:46:58,228 --> 00:47:00,196
looking forward
to having you home.

846
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,935
He's not getting any younger.

847
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:06,969
With you onboard,

848
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,439
maybe he'll take a day off
once in a while.

849
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,840
I know, Mum.

850
00:47:12,842 --> 00:47:15,077
I'm just not ready yet.

851
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:17,647
There's things in New York
that I wanna see through.

852
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,086
Well, I'm happy
I finally met Rachel.

853
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:26,320
She is very impressive.

854
00:47:26,322 --> 00:47:28,456
I think so, too.

855
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,724
I thought
you might be excited

856
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:32,193
that the first girl
that I bring home

857
00:47:32,195 --> 00:47:34,397
is a Chinese professor.

858
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:38,169
Chinese American.

859
00:47:41,438 --> 00:47:44,907
You know, bringing her home,

860
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:48,244
introducing her
at a large family gathering,

861
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,645
some people may say...

862
00:47:50,647 --> 00:47:52,848
When there's something
to say

863
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,384
about Rachel and me,
you'll be first to hear.

864
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:04,759
But some things I need to
figure out on my own.

865
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:07,831
Is that an American accent
I'm hearing?

866
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:10,868
How do I look?

867
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:19,776
Perfect.

868
00:48:33,356 --> 00:48:35,456
Everyone! Everyone!

869
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:38,459
The <i>tan hua</i> plants
very rarely bloom,

870
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:40,896
and even then only at night.

871
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:45,500
Their beauty is spectacular
but fleeting.

872
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:48,436
By dawn, they'll be gone.

873
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:50,640
Come. Come.

874
00:48:59,282 --> 00:49:01,850
Oh, someone forgot
to wear a bra.

875
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:06,754
Kitty Pong. Cousin Alistair's
latest flame. An actress.

876
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:11,260
Rumor is, she was in a porno.
<i>Two Girls, One Cup of Noodles.</i>

877
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:13,962
You know, I thought I would
like that more than I did.

878
00:49:13,964 --> 00:49:15,966
- The book was much better.
- Mmm-hmm.

879
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:22,637
Is it just me
or are people staring at me?

880
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,340
Oh, they're just jealous.
You nabbed the crown prince.

881
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:29,912
Nicki is <i>Ah Ma's</i> favorite,
in line to inherit everything.

882
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:32,747
No surprise there
when that's the competition.

883
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:36,921
Oh, speaking of
the grande dame...

884
00:49:58,976 --> 00:49:59,942
There you are.

885
00:49:59,944 --> 00:50:01,342
I've been looking
all over for you.

886
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:03,780
You ready to meet
my grandmother?

887
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:07,323
<i>Ah Ma...</i>

888
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:52,160
Look,
they're in full bloom.

889
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:11,512
It's so nice
having Nick back home.

890
00:51:11,514 --> 00:51:14,018
But he seems different.

891
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:19,453
When children are away
from home too long,

892
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,491
they forget who they are.

893
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:33,768
What's up? Let's jam!

894
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:45,446
Rachel!
So happy you're here. Oh!

895
00:51:45,448 --> 00:51:49,351
Oh, my God.
Your Gap look, brilliant.

896
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:51,153
Thanks.

897
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:53,554
- She's coming with me.
- Uh, hold on.

898
00:51:53,556 --> 00:51:55,556
Kiss. 36 hours. Bye.

899
00:51:55,558 --> 00:51:57,792
- Minty, one piece please.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

900
00:51:57,794 --> 00:51:59,460
Not listening at all.

901
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:01,997
So, I'm gonna intro you
to my posse.

902
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:04,967
We're flying to
my mom's resort in Sumatra.

903
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:08,904
She's closed down
the whole place just for us.

904
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,838
We're gonna have so much fun.

905
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,042
Come on, meet the girls.
Girls, this is Rachel Chu.

906
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:15,045
Hi!

907
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,516
So you let Bernard Tai
organize all of this?

908
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:23,753
Yeah.

909
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:25,921
Bernard.

910
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:26,991
Hey.

911
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:30,227
This is for you, asshole.

912
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:38,532
Tina! Tini!
The twins are in the house!

913
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:42,536
I'm so glad you made it!
How are you?

914
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:44,072
It's easy to make
a killer entrance

915
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,008
when you come
as a matching set.

916
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,211
Hi, we haven't met.
I'm Amanda Ling.

917
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,446
Hi, I'm Rachel Chu.

918
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:53,215
Oh, you're
Nick Young's friend.

919
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:55,783
- Yeah.
- Word gets around fast here.

920
00:52:55,785 --> 00:52:58,320
You're a professor
at NYU, right?

921
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:00,554
Yes. Um, what about you?

922
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:02,723
Oh, I'm a lawyer.
General counsel

923
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:04,825
to the Young Family
Corporation, actually.

924
00:53:04,827 --> 00:53:06,294
That's very impressive.

925
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:09,164
Mmm. Nah. Just good,
old-fashioned nepotism.

926
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:12,100
I grew up with Nick and Colin.
We're family friends.

927
00:53:12,102 --> 00:53:14,236
It's nice to meet you,
Rachel Chu.

928
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:19,640
Ladies, come on.
We're wheels up in five.

929
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:20,942
Let's do this?

930
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:22,244
Let's go.

931
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:30,452
Yeah!

932
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:33,855
All I wanted was a weekend
away with my boys.

933
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:36,324
And some beer.
Maybe some rugby.

934
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:39,061
Don't worry. It's gonna be
great, whatever happens.

935
00:53:39,063 --> 00:53:40,095
Yeah.

936
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:42,230
Let's make
some babies!

937
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:45,135
I don't think it will be.

938
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:58,813
Any asshole can plan
a normal stag party.

939
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:02,317
Hookers, drugs, dog-fighting.

940
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,886
That's minor league shit.

941
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:07,155
To organize a party
this massive...

942
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:09,458
Takes a massive asshole.

943
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,027
...takes a goddamn mastermind.

944
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:14,098
Where exactly is this party?

945
00:54:15,665 --> 00:54:17,101
It's right there.

946
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:23,006
Bloody hell!

947
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:34,815
Whoo!

948
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:06,647
Did you just see that?

949
00:55:06,649 --> 00:55:08,782
Oh, my God, Nick.
What are you worried about?

950
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:10,018
You don't have to
keep Rachel happy.

951
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,586
She's just lucky to be here.

952
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:12,954
Nice, Eddie.

953
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:14,489
Oh, what?

954
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:16,324
So we're gonna pretend
like that's not the truth?

955
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:17,725
Are we in some kind of
fairy tale story

956
00:55:17,727 --> 00:55:18,960
that I don't know about?

957
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:20,395
Did you find a shoe
at midnight

958
00:55:20,397 --> 00:55:21,829
and jump in a pumpkin?

959
00:55:21,831 --> 00:55:24,266
Yo, I got so much shit
about marrying Fiona,

960
00:55:24,268 --> 00:55:25,467
and her parents own

961
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:27,536
the biggest shipping company
in Hong Kong.

962
00:55:27,538 --> 00:55:30,005
Hey, Araminta's adorable,
but you think your dad

963
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:31,573
would be spending millions
on this wedding

964
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:34,876
if her parents didn't own
a billion-dollar resort chain?

965
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,012
What's Rachel bringing
to the table?

966
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:39,614
Oh! Small tits!

967
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:41,016
Oh!

968
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:43,985
Hey. It's not worth it, man.
They're drunk.

969
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:47,856
Hey, guys,
this is boring. Massage time.

970
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:50,492
And you, the bachelor,

971
00:55:50,494 --> 00:55:53,261
you're gonna get one
before this weekend is over.

972
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:56,965
Or we're gonna tie you up
and shave your coo coo chara.

973
00:55:58,635 --> 00:56:00,235
Coo coo chara!

974
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,472
Hey, come try this.

975
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:05,841
We have to get off this ship.

976
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,955
Welcome to paradise.

977
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:23,393
This is Samsara Island.

978
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:28,196
This weekend
is about sisterhood

979
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:32,467
and connecting
with the divine in all of us.

980
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:36,770
So, I hope you'll all find
your bliss,

981
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:40,741
starting with an all-paid
shopping spree

982
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:42,810
at the fashion boutique!

983
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:50,952
Come on! Come on!

984
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,123
Bitch, I saw this first!

985
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,324
But you have ping pong tits!

986
00:56:56,326 --> 00:56:57,626
What about
your mosquito bites?

987
00:56:57,628 --> 00:56:59,294
- No!
- You know it's true!

988
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:03,831
One more minute!
You keep what you can carry.

989
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:08,570
One more minute!
You keep what you can carry.

990
00:57:08,572 --> 00:57:12,806
Yeah, no one loves free stuff
more than rich people.

991
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:14,542
Just the one dress for you?

992
00:57:14,544 --> 00:57:17,379
I don't wanna lose an arm.

993
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:20,117
Ooh. Well, in that case,

994
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:25,122
one last touch.

995
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,996
Well, isn't Nick a lucky guy.

996
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:36,464
Time's up!

997
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:38,967
Next stop... Spa!

998
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:47,909
You're a genius.
You know that, right?

999
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:49,377
What's a best man for?

1000
00:57:49,379 --> 00:57:51,546
Guess that pilot's license
came in handy after all.

1001
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:53,548
Here you go, champ.

1002
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,083
Oh, thank you, sir.

1003
00:57:55,085 --> 00:57:57,452
Mmm. I think that is the best
beer I've ever had.

1004
00:57:57,454 --> 00:58:00,357
I'm gonna have to agree
with you on that.

1005
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,060
You know,
if it wasn't for Araminta,

1006
00:58:05,062 --> 00:58:06,795
I'd ask you to marry me.

1007
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:10,467
Although,

1008
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:14,035
there is a little something

1009
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:15,372
that might get
in the way of that.

1010
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:20,008
Mmm.

1011
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,310
- No!
- Yeah.

1012
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:24,779
- Is that real?
- Yes.

1013
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,281
- Wow! Yes!
- Yes.

1014
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:28,283
Yes, man! Congratulations!

1015
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:30,385
- I know.
- That is freaking amazing.

1016
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:32,053
- I'm ready.
- You're ready.

1017
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:34,089
You're doing it.

1018
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:36,124
Nick, I'm really happy
for you, man.

1019
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:38,228
Thanks, dude.

1020
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:49,671
I think my masseuse
just got me pregnant.

1021
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:58,248
I can see why Nick put off
coming back to Singapore.

1022
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,415
What do you mean?

1023
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:03,651
You know, he was supposed
to come back last year,

1024
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:05,687
take over the family business.

1025
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:08,289
His parents freaked out
when he didn't.

1026
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:12,862
But, now that he's back,
I'm sure all is forgiven.

1027
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:14,562
But he's not back
for good.

1028
00:59:14,564 --> 00:59:16,600
I mean,
we're just here for a wedding.

1029
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:22,305
Wow!

1030
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:24,906
But?

1031
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:27,208
No, I'm really happy for you.

1032
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,277
Colin, I've known you
since you were in nappies.

1033
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:31,813
I know when there's something
on your mind.

1034
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:34,516
Well, it wasn't
that long ago

1035
00:59:34,518 --> 00:59:37,986
that you were sure
you were moving back home.

1036
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:42,058
And I mean, Rachel loves
her job in New York.

1037
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:45,593
Yeah, we're gonna
figure that out.

1038
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:48,963
You're going to
figure it out. Right.

1039
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:51,566
<i>Rachel, I get it.</i>

1040
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:53,134
It's hard knowing
where you stand

1041
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:55,036
with someone
like Nicholas Young.

1042
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:57,472
He has all that pressure
from his family.

1043
00:59:57,474 --> 01:00:01,709
Not just in business,
but in who he's dating.

1044
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:03,645
It's like, you just never know

1045
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:06,550
what's quite going on
in that gorgeous head of his.

1046
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:12,888
Nick told you that
we were together, right?

1047
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,323
It's ancient history now.

1048
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:18,861
Although our families,
particularly his mother,

1049
01:00:18,863 --> 01:00:22,096
always wanted us
to get married.

1050
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:23,598
I guess we weren't ready then.

1051
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,334
Dude, ever since
primary school,

1052
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:28,203
you were always going to be

1053
01:00:28,205 --> 01:00:30,839
the next chairman
of the Young Corporation,

1054
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:32,974
your family's shining heir.

1055
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:34,309
You really think
your family's going to

1056
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:36,811
accept anything
less than that?

1057
01:00:36,813 --> 01:00:38,448
I mean, unless you...

1058
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:40,782
No.

1059
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:44,452
Are you thinking
of walking out?

1060
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:47,188
Leaving everything
to bloody Alistair and Eddie?

1061
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,290
I'm not walking out
on anything.

1062
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:52,660
I met a girl, I fell in love
and I want to marry her.

1063
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:55,497
And it can't just be
one thing or the other.

1064
01:00:55,499 --> 01:00:57,031
Uh... No, no, no.

1065
01:00:57,033 --> 01:01:00,335
It's not that simple.
You know that.

1066
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:02,370
I really admire you.

1067
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:05,807
It takes guts
coming all the way over here,

1068
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,542
facing Nick's family.

1069
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:11,847
Especially when Eleanor isn't
exactly in your corner.

1070
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:14,382
Okay, your family aside,
have you ever thought about

1071
01:01:14,384 --> 01:01:16,651
what your relationship
with Rachel

1072
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:19,220
will be like
if you got married?

1073
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:20,622
I mean, okay,

1074
01:01:20,624 --> 01:01:22,657
you're Nicholas Young.
You're untouchable.

1075
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:27,562
You always have been.
But Rachel's not.

1076
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:30,698
<i>And if she becomes
Mrs. Nicholas Young,</i>

1077
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,336
<i>every day for her
is going to be a struggle.</i>

1078
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:42,510
<i>I heard she told Tini
that Nick is a good catch.</i>

1079
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:45,413
So typical.
She's not even that pretty.

1080
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:48,816
It's like she's never heard
of plastic surgery.

1081
01:01:48,818 --> 01:01:50,420
Oh, shit.

1082
01:01:56,693 --> 01:01:58,092
Sorry.

1083
01:01:58,094 --> 01:01:59,763
You sure she's ready for that?

1084
01:02:08,572 --> 01:02:09,773
Rachel?

1085
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:19,647
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1086
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:22,150
Let's just forget
about those girls.

1087
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:23,318
Camp out here

1088
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,680
and order room service?

1089
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,532
I'll call security.

1090
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:38,602
No.

1091
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:44,205
I'm not gonna make a scene.

1092
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:46,676
I'm not gonna give them
the satisfaction.

1093
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:56,117
This weekend was supposed
to be mani-pedis,

1094
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:58,486
cocktails served
in pineapples.

1095
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,856
This definitely wasn't
on the menu.

1096
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:03,993
Why would Araminta even have
friends like that?

1097
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:05,660
They're so mean.

1098
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:08,063
Well, you grow up
your whole lives together,

1099
01:03:08,065 --> 01:03:09,766
you make excuses for people.

1100
01:03:10,901 --> 01:03:12,800
Specially the morons.

1101
01:03:12,802 --> 01:03:15,403
I mean, I know Michael didn't
have to deal with catty,

1102
01:03:15,405 --> 01:03:18,473
fish-killing sociopaths.

1103
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:20,911
How did you two
get through all this?

1104
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:27,317
Well, I didn't have it quite
as bad, but it wasn't pretty.

1105
01:03:28,752 --> 01:03:32,054
Well, at least tell me
it gets better.

1106
01:03:32,056 --> 01:03:34,391
Of course it does.

1107
01:03:38,828 --> 01:03:39,829
You okay?

1108
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:42,565
Yeah.

1109
01:03:56,813 --> 01:04:00,784
Actually... No.

1110
01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:08,525
You could talk to me.

1111
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:19,269
Michael is having an affair.

1112
01:04:27,978 --> 01:04:30,246
I'm really sorry, Astrid.

1113
01:04:59,843 --> 01:05:02,077
<i>I thought I was here
to meet your family,</i>

1114
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,512
go to your best friend's
wedding, eat some good food.

1115
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:07,415
Instead, I feel like I'm
a villain in a soap opera

1116
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:10,653
who's plotting to steal
your family fortune.

1117
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:13,590
What happened?

1118
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:15,891
I mean, I met Amanda.

1119
01:05:15,893 --> 01:05:18,060
She told me
that everyone here thinks

1120
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:19,260
that I'm the evil person

1121
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:20,628
that prevented you
from moving back

1122
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,997
to Singapore last year,

1123
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:23,198
when I didn't even know

1124
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,366
you were supposed
to come home.

1125
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:27,468
You have every reason
to be upset.

1126
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:28,904
I'm not done yet.

1127
01:05:28,906 --> 01:05:32,908
There was also this gutted,
bloody fish

1128
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:35,144
that Araminta's friends
left for me

1129
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:36,444
in my hotel room

1130
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:38,346
on my bed next to the words,

1131
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:41,382
"Catch this,
you gold-digging bitch."

1132
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:44,418
Written in big,
fat serial-killer letters.

1133
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,687
Is that all that happened?

1134
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:48,756
I mean, please tell me
that's all that happened.

1135
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:50,291
You know what?
I don't even care

1136
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:51,559
about those stupid girls

1137
01:05:51,561 --> 01:05:53,427
with their stupid little
designer handbags

1138
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:54,729
and sunglasses.
I don't care about that.

1139
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:56,231
I don't care
that your ex-girlfriend

1140
01:05:56,233 --> 01:05:57,565
told me all this crap.

1141
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:59,087
It's that you didn't
tell me any of it.

1142
01:05:59,836 --> 01:06:00,903
I screwed up.

1143
01:06:00,905 --> 01:06:02,204
Why? Were you trying
to test me?

1144
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:03,538
I really
messed up, okay?

1145
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,207
- Why would you do that?
- I made a mistake.

1146
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,877
When we first met,
you had no idea who I was,

1147
01:06:08,879 --> 01:06:10,913
who my family were.
You didn't care!

1148
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:13,815
Yeah, I don't care
about that stupid stuff.

1149
01:06:13,817 --> 01:06:16,051
Well, exactly.

1150
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:19,021
You are so different
from all of the women

1151
01:06:19,023 --> 01:06:20,590
that I grew up with.

1152
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:24,594
And I love who I am
around you.

1153
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:29,397
I don't want that to change.

1154
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:33,101
- And that's selfish, I know.
- Mmm-hmm.

1155
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:35,471
I'm sorry that you had to deal
with that on your own.

1156
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:40,741
But I'm here now.

1157
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:43,245
Whatever happens,
we'll get through it together.

1158
01:06:43,247 --> 01:06:45,082
Dead fish and all.

1159
01:06:46,317 --> 01:06:48,016
All right?

1160
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:49,452
It was so gross.

1161
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:52,056
But I buried it.

1162
01:06:55,092 --> 01:06:56,390
You dealt with it.

1163
01:06:58,128 --> 01:06:59,662
Come here.

1164
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,200
You know what? We need to do
something tonight.

1165
01:07:05,202 --> 01:07:07,336
We need to do something
that's just you and me, okay?

1166
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:09,104
- 100% agree.
- Yes.

1167
01:07:09,106 --> 01:07:13,676
But we do have to go
make some dumplings first.

1168
01:07:14,744 --> 01:07:15,643
Okay?

1169
01:07:15,645 --> 01:07:16,879
And can we eat them?

1170
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:18,280
We can eat
as many as you like.

1171
01:07:18,282 --> 01:07:19,547
Okay, fine.

1172
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:47,742
This is too much.

1173
01:07:47,744 --> 01:07:50,078
We're hosting
a rehearsal dinner,

1174
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,114
not feeding an army.

1175
01:07:52,116 --> 01:07:54,751
Better too many than have
people say we're stingy.

1176
01:07:55,886 --> 01:07:58,153
So, right.

1177
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,889
You put the baby in bed.

1178
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:06,061
You tuck, tuck, tuck.
Same on the other side.

1179
01:08:06,063 --> 01:08:08,397
You give him
a kiss good night.

1180
01:08:08,399 --> 01:08:10,032
That's so cute.

1181
01:08:10,034 --> 01:08:11,900
- How's that?
- And then you eat the baby.

1182
01:08:11,902 --> 01:08:14,136
Then you eat the baby
after he's cooked.

1183
01:08:14,138 --> 01:08:15,871
No, you gotta
make sure he's cooked.

1184
01:08:15,873 --> 01:08:17,172
Did your <i>Ah Ma</i> teach you that?

1185
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:18,941
She did.

1186
01:08:18,943 --> 01:08:20,541
I, on the other hand,

1187
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:22,244
was taught
by Grand-Auntie Mabel.

1188
01:08:22,246 --> 01:08:24,545
You put the Botox in the face,

1189
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:27,883
and then
you pinch, pinch, pinch.

1190
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:30,618
Then, <i>voila!</i>

1191
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,687
Did you guys all learn
when you were kids?

1192
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:33,956
We didn't have a choice.

1193
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:35,723
We taught you so you'd know

1194
01:08:35,725 --> 01:08:37,658
the blood, sweat,
and tears it took

1195
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,460
to raise and feed you monkeys.

1196
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:40,862
Not like the <i>ang-mohs</i>

1197
01:08:40,864 --> 01:08:42,763
microwaving macaroni
and cheese

1198
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:43,999
for their own children.

1199
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:45,833
No wonder
they put their parents

1200
01:08:45,835 --> 01:08:47,903
in the old folks' home
when they all grow up.

1201
01:08:47,905 --> 01:08:49,371
I know!

1202
01:08:49,373 --> 01:08:52,374
<i>Ah Ma</i> says if we don't pass
traditions down like this,

1203
01:08:52,376 --> 01:08:54,142
they'll disappear.

1204
01:08:54,144 --> 01:08:56,477
God forbid, we lose
the ancient Chinese tradition

1205
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,046
of guilting your children.

1206
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,715
It's totally worth it.

1207
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:02,384
Mother used to wait for me
after school

1208
01:09:02,386 --> 01:09:04,386
with a nice basket of these.

1209
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:11,492
Hey, I never got
after-school dumplings.

1210
01:09:11,494 --> 01:09:12,861
Well, that's because
Auntie Felicity

1211
01:09:12,863 --> 01:09:15,197
was doing after-school
microdermabrasion.

1212
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:26,540
Auntie, this is Dolce.

1213
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,377
You speak Cantonese?

1214
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:30,112
No, I don't.

1215
01:09:30,114 --> 01:09:33,614
It's just great seeing
you guys all like this.

1216
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:35,050
When I was growing up,

1217
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:37,953
it was just me and my mom,
which I loved.

1218
01:09:37,955 --> 01:09:40,755
But we didn't really have
a big family like this.

1219
01:09:40,757 --> 01:09:42,491
It's really nice.

1220
01:09:42,493 --> 01:09:44,993
Oh, that's so lovely
of you to say, Rachel.

1221
01:09:44,995 --> 01:09:47,597
We are all very lucky
to have each other.

1222
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:52,666
That's a beautiful ring,
Auntie Eleanor.

1223
01:09:52,668 --> 01:09:55,103
I've never seen
anything like it.

1224
01:09:55,105 --> 01:09:58,173
Nick's father had it made
when he proposed to me.

1225
01:09:58,175 --> 01:10:02,210
That's very romantic.
How did you guys meet?

1226
01:10:02,212 --> 01:10:04,246
Actually, they met
at Cambridge.

1227
01:10:04,248 --> 01:10:05,981
They were both
studying law together.

1228
01:10:05,983 --> 01:10:07,581
Oh, I didn't know
you were a lawyer.

1229
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,550
I wasn't.
I withdrew from university

1230
01:10:09,552 --> 01:10:10,986
when we got married.

1231
01:10:10,988 --> 01:10:12,154
Oh.

1232
01:10:12,156 --> 01:10:14,289
I chose to help my husband
run a business

1233
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,857
and to raise a family.

1234
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,460
For me, it was a privilege.

1235
01:10:18,462 --> 01:10:20,998
But for you, you may think
it's old-fashioned.

1236
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,900
It's nice
you appreciate this house

1237
01:10:24,902 --> 01:10:27,701
and us being here together
wrapping dumplings.

1238
01:10:27,703 --> 01:10:30,305
But all this
doesn't just happen.

1239
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:33,008
It's because we know
to put family first,

1240
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:35,812
instead of chasing
one's passion.

1241
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:44,021
<i>Ah Ma...</i>

1242
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:46,521
Thank you.

1243
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:48,156
Oh, Nick.

1244
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:49,424
Come and sit.

1245
01:11:03,574 --> 01:11:05,641
Mmm.

1246
01:11:06,076 --> 01:11:07,377
Mmm.

1247
01:11:49,586 --> 01:11:53,288
Oh, hi.
I think I'm a little lost.

1248
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:54,824
This house is pretty big.

1249
01:11:57,861 --> 01:11:59,928
I'm glad I found you.

1250
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,531
I am afraid
that I've been unfair.

1251
01:12:02,533 --> 01:12:03,899
Oh, no, you know what?

1252
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:05,799
I'm sorry
I made an assumption.

1253
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:07,302
I didn't mean to offend you.

1254
01:12:07,304 --> 01:12:08,305
Not at all.

1255
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:11,907
You asked about my ring.

1256
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:14,876
The truth is
Nick's father had it made

1257
01:12:14,878 --> 01:12:17,479
when he wanted
to propose to me

1258
01:12:17,481 --> 01:12:20,882
because <i>Ah Ma</i> wouldn't
give him the family ring.

1259
01:12:20,884 --> 01:12:23,518
I wasn't her first choice.

1260
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,422
Honestly, I wasn't her second.

1261
01:12:27,424 --> 01:12:30,691
Gosh, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

1262
01:12:30,693 --> 01:12:32,793
I didn't come
from the right family,

1263
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:34,396
have the right connections.

1264
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:35,997
And <i>Ah Ma</i> thought
I would not make

1265
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:37,632
an adequate wife to her son.

1266
01:12:37,634 --> 01:12:40,703
But she came around,
obviously.

1267
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:45,839
It took many years,

1268
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:48,643
and she had good reason
to be concerned.

1269
01:12:48,645 --> 01:12:51,779
Because I had no idea
the work

1270
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:54,815
and the sacrifice
it would take.

1271
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:57,052
There were many days
when I wondered

1272
01:12:57,054 --> 01:13:00,155
if I would ever measure up.

1273
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:02,825
But having been through
it all,

1274
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,828
I know this much.

1275
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:14,071
You will never be enough.

1276
01:13:18,308 --> 01:13:22,778
We should head back.
I wouldn't want Nick to worry.

1277
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:39,795
You all right?

1278
01:13:40,497 --> 01:13:41,498
Yeah.

1279
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:46,067
I know my mum
can be tough at times,

1280
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:50,771
but there isn't anything
she wouldn't do for me.

1281
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:54,376
And there is a reason why
I lived with <i>Ah Ma</i> growing up.

1282
01:13:54,378 --> 01:13:57,811
It's because my mother knew
she wasn't the favorite.

1283
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:01,351
So she let her raise me,
so I would be.

1284
01:14:02,886 --> 01:14:04,886
You were just a kid?

1285
01:14:04,888 --> 01:14:07,155
Yeah.

1286
01:14:07,157 --> 01:14:11,827
But it's hard to understand
from the outside.

1287
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:17,165
But she did what she thought
was best for the family.

1288
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:19,403
- Mmm-hmm.
- For everyone involved.

1289
01:14:21,538 --> 01:14:24,406
Anyway, I think I've had
enough with dumplings

1290
01:14:24,408 --> 01:14:26,840
for the rest of my life.

1291
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:28,610
What should we do?

1292
01:14:28,612 --> 01:14:32,049
Sushi, movies,
anything you like. Really.

1293
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:36,551
Wait, what?

1294
01:14:36,553 --> 01:14:39,521
Was she like, "You will never
be good enough for my son"?

1295
01:14:39,523 --> 01:14:41,990
Or was it like, "You...

1296
01:14:41,992 --> 01:14:44,227
"You will never be good enough
for my son"?

1297
01:14:45,395 --> 01:14:46,995
- It's like the second one.
- Oh.

1298
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:48,829
Except for in a way
that made me wanna cry

1299
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:50,065
and puke at the same time.

1300
01:14:50,067 --> 01:14:52,400
Gosh, she's so badass.

1301
01:14:52,402 --> 01:14:53,868
You know,
I bet if you told her

1302
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:55,403
you'd leave Nick
for a million dollars,

1303
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:57,472
she will write that check.
They do that around here.

1304
01:14:57,474 --> 01:14:59,808
And she looked at me
like I was nothing.

1305
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,176
Like a $10 million check.

1306
01:15:01,178 --> 01:15:02,477
I feel like she would do that.

1307
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:04,479
I don't even know
what I should do.

1308
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:07,349
I mean, I can't even tell Nick
because he worships her.

1309
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:09,584
Yeah, Chinese sons
think their moms

1310
01:15:09,586 --> 01:15:11,419
fart Chanel No. 5.

1311
01:15:11,421 --> 01:15:14,522
What about the <i>Ah Ma?</i>
Does she hate your face, too?

1312
01:15:14,524 --> 01:15:17,325
Okay, nobody said
they hated my face.

1313
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:22,397
And <i>Ah Ma,</i> she liked my face.
She said I had a lucky nose.

1314
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:23,631
That's great!

1315
01:15:23,633 --> 01:15:25,367
You know, Eleanor can hate you
all day long,

1316
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:28,803
but you can't beat 2,000 years
of Chinese filial piety.

1317
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:31,306
I feel like I shouldn't
even go to the wedding.

1318
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:33,408
You know,
it's Colin and Araminta's day.

1319
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:34,909
I don't wanna cause
any drama there.

1320
01:15:34,911 --> 01:15:37,812
I feel like I should just
sit it out.

1321
01:15:37,814 --> 01:15:40,951
You know? Tell Nick I had
food poisoning or something.

1322
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,987
- What?
- That's bullshit.

1323
01:15:45,989 --> 01:15:47,789
- You're just scared.
- No, I'm not.

1324
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:51,059
Okay, here's what you need to
understand. All right?

1325
01:15:51,061 --> 01:15:53,161
It's not about getting Eleanor
to like you.

1326
01:15:53,163 --> 01:15:56,197
It's about getting her
to respect you, all right?

1327
01:15:56,199 --> 01:15:59,300
Right now, she just thinks
you're some undeserving,

1328
01:15:59,302 --> 01:16:02,303
- clueless, gold-digging...
- Yeah, I got it.

1329
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:05,407
...trashy, unrefined banana.

1330
01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:07,909
Yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

1331
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:10,111
I know what a banana is.

1332
01:16:10,113 --> 01:16:12,647
When, in reality, you're
a super sophisticated, smart

1333
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:15,350
professor of
freaking game theory.

1334
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:17,354
Show her that side of you,
you know?

1335
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:19,053
You're right.

1336
01:16:19,055 --> 01:16:20,255
Damn straight, I'm right.

1337
01:16:20,257 --> 01:16:22,023
It's Peik Lin,
I'm always right.

1338
01:16:22,025 --> 01:16:23,291
Yeah, she's like
trying to play

1339
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:25,026
a game of chicken with me.

1340
01:16:25,028 --> 01:16:27,195
Where she's like coming at me,
and thinking

1341
01:16:27,197 --> 01:16:28,696
I'm going to swerve
like a chicken.

1342
01:16:28,698 --> 01:16:29,964
But you can't swerve.

1343
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:31,366
I'm not gonna swerve.
Not for her.

1344
01:16:31,368 --> 01:16:33,134
No.
Chickens are bitches, dude!

1345
01:16:33,136 --> 01:16:35,170
- And I'm not a chicken.
- You're not a chicken.

1346
01:16:35,172 --> 01:16:36,604
You're gonna roll up
to that wedding,

1347
01:16:36,606 --> 01:16:38,473
you're gonna be like,
"Bak-bak, bitch!"

1348
01:16:38,475 --> 01:16:39,541
Bak-bak, bitch!

1349
01:16:39,543 --> 01:16:41,976
Chickens are bitches.

1350
01:16:41,978 --> 01:16:44,078
Sorry, Uncle.

1351
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,413
What are you doing tonight?

1352
01:16:45,415 --> 01:16:47,782
I was gonna go to FedEx
or something.

1353
01:16:47,784 --> 01:16:50,218
Why? Oh!

1354
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:53,188
I have been waiting to
do this properly for so long.

1355
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,390
I'm thinking eyebrow triage,
root crimps,

1356
01:16:55,392 --> 01:16:56,892
maybe some eyelid tape.

1357
01:16:56,894 --> 01:16:58,960
What do you think?

1358
01:16:58,962 --> 01:17:00,662
Ugh. All of it.

1359
01:17:00,664 --> 01:17:03,465
And I would throw in
a Korean snail face mask.

1360
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:07,135
Sweetie, your skin is so dry,
it's hurting my face.

1361
01:17:07,137 --> 01:17:08,369
Thank you.

1362
01:17:08,371 --> 01:17:09,872
You know, it's about time

1363
01:17:09,874 --> 01:17:11,773
someone stood up
to Auntie Eleanor.

1364
01:17:11,775 --> 01:17:13,208
Well, you, not me. Oh, God!

1365
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:14,609
She can't know
I was ever here.

1366
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:15,945
Oh, no.

1367
01:17:15,947 --> 01:17:19,514
Right. Well, okay, let's get
to work. Cappuccinos.

1368
01:17:30,594 --> 01:17:33,027
Pull the plum Balenciaga,
the peach Chloe,

1369
01:17:33,029 --> 01:17:35,430
the Giambattista,
all the Bottegas.

1370
01:17:35,432 --> 01:17:37,732
Oh, and that Jason Wu with
the deconstructed ruffles.

1371
01:17:37,734 --> 01:17:39,434
And a sandwich for Peik Lin.

1372
01:17:39,436 --> 01:17:42,370
- Oh! Okay. All right.
- Oh. Right.

1373
01:17:42,372 --> 01:17:43,638
I'm not sure if it's working

1374
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,175
or if she looks like
a clown's tampon.

1375
01:17:47,177 --> 01:17:48,978
On a heavy day.

1376
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,812
You look like a flower.

1377
01:17:50,814 --> 01:17:54,917
A sad, lonely flower
no one wants to be around.

1378
01:17:58,588 --> 01:18:00,488
I mean, it's the wedding
of the century.

1379
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:02,650
So, of course, we're here.
It's the natural...

1380
01:18:03,593 --> 01:18:05,529
Oh!

1381
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:10,598
It's not that bad.

1382
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,333
It's holding you up.

1383
01:18:12,335 --> 01:18:14,569
It's a hands-on dress.
You know what I mean?

1384
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:15,705
Incoming.

1385
01:18:16,506 --> 01:18:17,541
Okay.

1386
01:18:22,045 --> 01:18:23,545
I love my fans.

1387
01:18:23,547 --> 01:18:25,948
<i>Taipei Tiger 2</i> is going
to redefine the genre.

1388
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:28,583
- She's a star. She's a star.
- <i>TT2,</i> honey.

1389
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:29,551
Oh!

1390
01:18:29,553 --> 01:18:31,152
I'm blinded by the light.

1391
01:18:31,154 --> 01:18:32,720
This is why disco died.

1392
01:18:32,722 --> 01:18:34,990
You kind of look
like a slutty Ebola virus.

1393
01:18:34,992 --> 01:18:38,726
It's like a bag of Skittles.
Taste the rainbow.

1394
01:18:38,728 --> 01:18:39,761
Could work if we...

1395
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:41,663
Yes. I think
we just ought to...

1396
01:18:41,665 --> 01:18:44,832
I just think if we could tell
her this is coming from you

1397
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:46,936
'cause she probably doesn't
want to hear it from a guy.

1398
01:18:46,938 --> 01:18:48,037
Okay. Okay.

1399
01:18:49,573 --> 01:18:51,907
Okay, remember.
Optimal angles.

1400
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:09,959
Just right here!
Just right here!

1401
01:19:19,636 --> 01:19:20,737
Ma'am.

1402
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,547
Everyone, I've got
Rachel Chu of New York.

1403
01:19:32,549 --> 01:19:34,351
Rachel Chu of New York.

1404
01:19:38,889 --> 01:19:40,755
Rachel! Rachel! To me!

1405
01:19:40,757 --> 01:19:43,257
Okay, ladies, looking good.

1406
01:19:43,259 --> 01:19:44,692
Out of the way, please.
Out of the way.

1407
01:19:44,694 --> 01:19:47,462
- So gorgeous!
- Thank you.

1408
01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:49,132
Ladies, move, please.
Out of the way!

1409
01:19:50,467 --> 01:19:53,236
Good, that's great.
Beautiful dress.

1410
01:19:53,904 --> 01:19:55,438
Ladies.

1411
01:19:57,574 --> 01:19:58,539
Amanda.

1412
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:01,344
- Mmm.
- You're in my way.

1413
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:06,716
Okay, what?

1414
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:12,220
<i>Our Chinese investors
are getting nervous.</i>

1415
01:20:12,222 --> 01:20:14,255
I have to fly in to Shenzhen
on Monday

1416
01:20:14,257 --> 01:20:16,959
to try and talk them down.

1417
01:20:16,961 --> 01:20:18,863
That's Cassian's birthday.

1418
01:20:20,097 --> 01:20:22,430
Yeah, I know.

1419
01:20:22,432 --> 01:20:27,669
I hate to miss it,
but this is important.

1420
01:20:27,671 --> 01:20:30,571
You'd think your son's
birthday's important.

1421
01:20:30,573 --> 01:20:32,407
Get someone else to handle it.

1422
01:20:36,746 --> 01:20:41,418
Unless there's another reason
you're out of town?

1423
01:20:43,154 --> 01:20:45,221
What are you saying?

1424
01:20:54,197 --> 01:20:56,165
I know
you're having an affair.

1425
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,266
Oh, Jesus. Astrid.

1426
01:20:58,268 --> 01:21:00,735
Let's just
get through the wedding,

1427
01:21:00,737 --> 01:21:02,437
and we'll deal with it after.

1428
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:04,607
I don't wanna make a scene.

1429
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:09,878
You find out
I'm having an affair

1430
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,979
with another woman,

1431
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:13,581
and you're worried
about making a scene?

1432
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:16,484
You'd rather I scream
and carry on?

1433
01:21:16,486 --> 01:21:20,254
Yes. Honestly,
I wish you would.

1434
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:22,958
It would show you cared about
more than what people thought

1435
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,493
of you and your family.

1436
01:21:25,495 --> 01:21:27,628
Don't try and turn this on me.

1437
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,898
I'm not the one
who screwed up!

1438
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,232
Of course not.

1439
01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:33,401
You're always the prettiest,

1440
01:21:33,403 --> 01:21:35,570
richest, most perfect girl
in the room.

1441
01:21:35,572 --> 01:21:37,039
While I'm just
this lucky bastard

1442
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,372
who will never measure up.

1443
01:21:38,374 --> 01:21:39,774
Don't say that.

1444
01:21:39,776 --> 01:21:41,809
I know
what you're thinking, Astrid.

1445
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:43,879
That's why
you hide your shoes,

1446
01:21:43,881 --> 01:21:45,279
the jewelry you buy,

1447
01:21:45,281 --> 01:21:48,351
as if every minute of my life
I'm not reminded of it.

1448
01:21:49,419 --> 01:21:51,987
I'm just tired.

1449
01:21:51,989 --> 01:21:55,556
I'm tired of having nothing
I do matter.

1450
01:21:55,558 --> 01:21:58,060
Including having the affair.

1451
01:21:58,062 --> 01:22:01,997
Of course
what you do matters!

1452
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:05,333
How can you say that?

1453
01:22:33,197 --> 01:22:35,864
Is this a church
or a paddy field?

1454
01:22:35,866 --> 01:22:38,299
They spent 40 million
on the wedding.

1455
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:40,002
Really? That's too much.

1456
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:42,137
We're Methodists.
20 million is our limit.

1457
01:22:42,139 --> 01:22:43,238
I know.

1458
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:47,142
Princess Intan. Vicious woman.

1459
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:50,711
I heard she demanded
a whole row to herself,

1460
01:22:50,713 --> 01:22:53,215
so she wouldn't be bothered
by anyone.

1461
01:22:53,217 --> 01:22:54,450
Really?

1462
01:22:57,787 --> 01:22:59,489
Who is that?

1463
01:23:12,836 --> 01:23:14,104
Aunties.

1464
01:23:15,505 --> 01:23:19,208
Rachel, how lovely to see you.

1465
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:20,978
The pleasure is all mine.

1466
01:23:22,412 --> 01:23:24,915
I'm sorry,
our row is full.

1467
01:23:33,489 --> 01:23:35,960
I love it.

1468
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:43,364
Bak-bak. Okay.

1469
01:23:51,808 --> 01:23:55,476
Princess Intan. Rachel Chu.

1470
01:23:55,478 --> 01:23:58,113
I read your great article
about microloans

1471
01:23:58,115 --> 01:23:59,747
in the
<i>Asian Economics Journal.</i>

1472
01:23:59,749 --> 01:24:02,184
I received so much criticism

1473
01:24:02,186 --> 01:24:03,852
about that article.

1474
01:24:03,854 --> 01:24:06,687
Well, you know what? I think
your critics missed the point.

1475
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:09,157
'Cause your microloans
helped women,

1476
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:11,128
and women lift up economies.

1477
01:24:12,562 --> 01:24:15,097
What was your name, again?

1478
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:16,530
Rachel Chu.

1479
01:24:16,532 --> 01:24:18,300
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1480
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:20,202
Now, what brings you here?

1481
01:24:20,204 --> 01:24:21,736
I followed a boy...

1482
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,376
<i>Ah Ma</i> is here.

1483
01:24:27,378 --> 01:24:29,679
She never comes
to these things.

1484
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:54,735
How are you feeling?

1485
01:24:54,737 --> 01:24:56,338
- Good.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

1486
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,873
- I'm not nervous.
- You look great.

1487
01:24:57,875 --> 01:24:59,473
Thank you.

1488
01:24:59,475 --> 01:25:02,344
Hey, Rachel's not sitting
with your family.

1489
01:25:02,346 --> 01:25:04,046
Yeah. I don't blame her.

1490
01:25:04,048 --> 01:25:06,848
Mother hasn't exactly been
the most welcoming.

1491
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:10,685
But I'm sure she'll be at
the back somewhere laying low.

1492
01:25:10,687 --> 01:25:14,590
No. She's right at the front.
Take a look.

1493
01:25:21,932 --> 01:25:24,234
I think you've got a fighter.

1494
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:31,607
Guys, it's time.

1495
01:25:32,409 --> 01:25:35,177
- Okay.
- All right.

1496
01:25:35,179 --> 01:25:36,777
- Hey.
- Yeah?

1497
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:38,413
Make sure
she doesn't take your balls.

1498
01:25:40,217 --> 01:25:41,782
Just joking. Just joking.

1499
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:43,751
Thanks for dressing up,
Bernard.

1500
01:25:43,753 --> 01:25:45,553
Hey. It's not about me.

1501
01:25:45,555 --> 01:25:47,555
Yeah. Come on.
Thanks, Bernard.

1502
01:25:47,557 --> 01:25:50,058
- It's not about me.
- All right.

1503
01:29:24,707 --> 01:29:27,442
You look spectacular,
you know that?

1504
01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:30,345
It's the double Spanx.
I can't breathe.

1505
01:29:30,347 --> 01:29:34,284
It's not the clothes.
It's just you.

1506
01:29:35,586 --> 01:29:37,452
Uh, excuse me.

1507
01:29:37,454 --> 01:29:40,088
This party isn't gonna
dance itself. Come on.

1508
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:42,524
- Come on, Nicki-Nick.
- All right.

1509
01:29:42,526 --> 01:29:44,159
You're very good.

1510
01:29:44,161 --> 01:29:45,881
- Yeah? I only stepped on her twice.
- Very.

1511
01:30:05,949 --> 01:30:07,415
Oliver.

1512
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:09,251
Yes, Auntie?

1513
01:30:09,253 --> 01:30:11,019
Be a dear
and take care of that.

1514
01:30:14,358 --> 01:30:16,958
As you wish.

1515
01:30:27,803 --> 01:30:30,907
You know, you should wear
a tux more often.

1516
01:30:31,841 --> 01:30:34,576
Like, all the time?

1517
01:30:34,578 --> 01:30:36,311
Mmm, yeah.

1518
01:30:36,313 --> 01:30:39,381
You know, when you're
playing basketball at the Y,

1519
01:30:39,383 --> 01:30:42,519
shaving, brushing your teeth.

1520
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:53,662
Alistair, your father's
looking for you.

1521
01:30:53,664 --> 01:30:56,967
Something about an overdrawn
discretionary account.

1522
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:59,301
Oh, my God.

1523
01:30:59,303 --> 01:31:01,903
Baby! Oh, my gosh!

1524
01:31:03,006 --> 01:31:04,739
Oh. Hi.

1525
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:07,442
So, how do you like
the wedding?

1526
01:31:07,444 --> 01:31:11,379
Oh, my gosh!
It's so glamorous!

1527
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:13,748
When it's Alistair's
and my wedding,

1528
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,051
I want it
just like this.

1529
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:20,488
No, no, no! I want it big!
Big! Better!

1530
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:22,357
Sweetie!

1531
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:24,426
You'll be lucky
if Alistair's parents

1532
01:31:24,428 --> 01:31:26,461
give you a tea ceremony.

1533
01:31:26,463 --> 01:31:28,430
You know Alistair's
only the fourth son

1534
01:31:28,432 --> 01:31:30,198
of a penny-pinching family,
don't you?

1535
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,200
I mean, he'll get
next to nothing.

1536
01:31:32,202 --> 01:31:33,702
You want a wedding like this?

1537
01:31:33,704 --> 01:31:36,137
You should've fallen in love
with an only child.

1538
01:31:36,139 --> 01:31:37,574
Someone like...

1539
01:31:39,409 --> 01:31:41,109
Bernard Tai.

1540
01:31:45,449 --> 01:31:47,349
Master Nicholas,

1541
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:48,883
your grandmother would like

1542
01:31:48,885 --> 01:31:51,054
to speak to you
and Miss Rachel.

1543
01:31:53,623 --> 01:31:55,292
Okay.

1544
01:31:55,992 --> 01:31:57,359
Sick party.

1545
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:58,362
Yeah!

1546
01:31:59,863 --> 01:32:01,164
Hold that.

1547
01:32:13,543 --> 01:32:14,776
<i>Ah Ma,</i> Mum,

1548
01:32:14,778 --> 01:32:17,013
what's all this about?

1549
01:32:31,595 --> 01:32:33,027
<i>Ah Ma!</i>

1550
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:34,462
I'm sorry to tell you,

1551
01:32:34,464 --> 01:32:36,030
but Rachel has been lying
to us about her family

1552
01:32:36,032 --> 01:32:37,298
and her mother.

1553
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,500
What are... What are you
talking about?

1554
01:32:38,502 --> 01:32:40,268
I hired
a private investigator...

1555
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,137
- Mom, you didn't.
- ...to look into her past.

1556
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:43,471
She said her father
passed away in China...

1557
01:32:43,473 --> 01:32:44,606
Mum!

1558
01:32:44,608 --> 01:32:46,007
...but that's not true.

1559
01:32:46,009 --> 01:32:48,410
Your mother's husband
is very much alive.

1560
01:32:48,412 --> 01:32:50,545
During her marriage,
she cheated on him

1561
01:32:50,547 --> 01:32:52,680
and became pregnant
with another man's child.

1562
01:32:52,682 --> 01:32:55,450
And before he found out,
she ran away to America.

1563
01:32:55,452 --> 01:32:57,185
- It's all in here.
- You had no right!

1564
01:32:57,187 --> 01:32:58,854
- We had every right!
- You did not!

1565
01:32:58,856 --> 01:33:00,088
You're lying!

1566
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:01,089
Do you have any idea
the scandal

1567
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:02,424
this would have caused

1568
01:33:02,426 --> 01:33:04,428
for Rachel to hide
something like this?

1569
01:33:06,864 --> 01:33:08,663
She wouldn't have.

1570
01:33:08,665 --> 01:33:12,469
We cannot be linked
to this sort of family.

1571
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:19,007
I don't want
any part of your family.

1572
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:20,243
Rachel.

1573
01:33:24,214 --> 01:33:25,380
Let me go!
Rachel.

1574
01:33:25,382 --> 01:33:26,716
Nick!

1575
01:33:46,803 --> 01:33:48,536
Hey, Cinderella.
What's wrong?

1576
01:33:48,538 --> 01:33:51,274
You gotta return your dress
before midnight?

1577
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:56,211
- Nicki-Nick!
- Oh, you're just in time.

1578
01:34:08,425 --> 01:34:09,824
Oliver.

1579
01:34:09,826 --> 01:34:12,026
- Oh, Nicki, have you...
- Rachel. Have you seen Rachel?

1580
01:34:14,531 --> 01:34:15,965
Nicholas! Hi!

1581
01:34:15,967 --> 01:34:17,167
- It's been so long.
- Yes.

1582
01:34:20,804 --> 01:34:23,139
Amanda, no. Amanda, not now!

1583
01:35:06,383 --> 01:35:09,753
Rachel. Come to breakfast.

1584
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:13,421
You need to eat.

1585
01:35:13,423 --> 01:35:19,162
Or use the bathroom,
or maybe a shower.

1586
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:23,433
It's there if you need it.

1587
01:35:48,258 --> 01:35:51,759
Here, Rachel.
This is your dinner.

1588
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:53,296
Thank you.

1589
01:36:13,383 --> 01:36:15,316
<i>I'll stop by
again tonight.</i>

1590
01:36:15,318 --> 01:36:19,155
Rachel, please,
just give me a call.

1591
01:36:20,323 --> 01:36:24,394
Anytime. Please.

1592
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:39,307
Rachel,
someone's here to see ya.

1593
01:36:39,309 --> 01:36:41,409
I don't want
to see him.

1594
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:42,612
It's not Nick.

1595
01:36:46,117 --> 01:36:47,852
Mom!

1596
01:37:00,296 --> 01:37:02,797
Drink more.

1597
01:37:02,799 --> 01:37:06,403
The <i>dong-quai</i> and the ginseng
will give you more energy.

1598
01:37:09,106 --> 01:37:10,772
Thanks.

1599
01:37:10,774 --> 01:37:14,943
Your spirit
has always been so strong,

1600
01:37:14,945 --> 01:37:16,111
ever since young.

1601
01:37:16,113 --> 01:37:19,182
You will get through this.

1602
01:37:21,852 --> 01:37:25,255
Why didn't you tell me
about my father?

1603
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:39,536
My husband wasn't a good man.

1604
01:37:40,871 --> 01:37:42,439
He hurt me.

1605
01:37:45,475 --> 01:37:50,378
But an old schoolmate of mine
helped me through things,

1606
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,615
and we fell in love,

1607
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,686
and I got pregnant
with his baby.

1608
01:37:57,387 --> 01:37:59,787
That's you.

1609
01:37:59,789 --> 01:38:02,457
I was so afraid
my husband would find out

1610
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:03,758
and kill us both,

1611
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,297
so I just took you
and I ran to America.

1612
01:38:09,365 --> 01:38:11,301
Did you ever...

1613
01:38:12,635 --> 01:38:15,770
I don't know, think about
trying to talk to him?

1614
01:38:15,772 --> 01:38:17,774
I mean,
do you think about him?

1615
01:38:19,743 --> 01:38:20,808
Every day.

1616
01:38:20,810 --> 01:38:22,376
Oh.

1617
01:38:22,378 --> 01:38:24,512
When we first
came to America,

1618
01:38:24,514 --> 01:38:26,481
all I could think about
was reaching out for him,

1619
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:30,119
but I was so afraid
my husband would find us.

1620
01:38:30,121 --> 01:38:34,322
And now, I just don't want
to cause any trouble.

1621
01:38:34,324 --> 01:38:35,525
Oh...

1622
01:38:39,096 --> 01:38:40,730
I'm really sorry.

1623
01:38:42,332 --> 01:38:44,900
Oh! Don't be sorry.

1624
01:38:47,771 --> 01:38:49,270
You listen to me.

1625
01:38:49,272 --> 01:38:52,306
Everything that happened
in my past life

1626
01:38:52,308 --> 01:38:54,910
is the reason why I got you.

1627
01:38:56,546 --> 01:38:59,315
My brave and clever girl.

1628
01:39:14,564 --> 01:39:16,867
I really thought
he was the one.

1629
01:39:19,136 --> 01:39:21,071
Now, I just want to go home.

1630
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:27,176
You know, Nick was the one
who called me

1631
01:39:27,178 --> 01:39:29,811
and brought me out here.

1632
01:39:29,813 --> 01:39:34,852
Before we go, I think
you should go and talk to him.

1633
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:50,165
I'll e-mail the photo later.

1634
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:52,366
P.T., how long you been
standing there?

1635
01:39:52,368 --> 01:39:54,002
Just a short while.

1636
01:40:31,876 --> 01:40:35,678
I'm so sorry about everything.

1637
01:40:36,914 --> 01:40:39,047
What my mother did to you
is unforgivable.

1638
01:40:39,049 --> 01:40:41,151
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

1639
01:40:42,785 --> 01:40:44,019
Ever since I can remember,

1640
01:40:44,021 --> 01:40:45,888
my family has been
my whole life.

1641
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:48,825
And I am done
making excuses for them.

1642
01:40:58,434 --> 01:40:59,834
Nick.

1643
01:40:59,836 --> 01:41:01,469
Marry me.

1644
01:41:01,471 --> 01:41:02,703
Marry me, and we'll start

1645
01:41:02,705 --> 01:41:04,106
a new life together
in New York.

1646
01:41:04,108 --> 01:41:06,911
Just you and me.
I'll leave all of this behind.

1647
01:42:20,851 --> 01:42:22,785
Thanks for meeting me here.

1648
01:42:24,654 --> 01:42:26,054
Don't worry about them.

1649
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:28,591
They're half deaf
and they only speak Hokkien.

1650
01:42:56,519 --> 01:42:58,153
My mom taught me how to play.

1651
01:42:58,155 --> 01:43:00,422
She told me Mahjong
would teach me

1652
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:02,924
important life skills.

1653
01:43:02,926 --> 01:43:07,064
Negotiation,
strategy, cooperation.

1654
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:13,037
You asked me here. I assume
it's not for a Mahjong lesson.

1655
01:43:16,006 --> 01:43:17,041
Pong.

1656
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:22,913
My mother taught me, too.

1657
01:43:27,084 --> 01:43:30,986
I know Nick told you the truth
about my mom.

1658
01:43:30,988 --> 01:43:33,756
But you didn't like me
the second I got here.

1659
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:35,891
Why is that?

1660
01:43:35,893 --> 01:43:38,226
There is a Hokkien phrase.

1661
01:43:39,196 --> 01:43:41,564
It means,
"Our own kind of people."

1662
01:43:43,033 --> 01:43:45,699
And you're not our own kind.

1663
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:47,936
'Cause I'm not rich?

1664
01:43:47,938 --> 01:43:50,138
'Cause I didn't go to
a British boarding school,

1665
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,773
or I wasn't born
into a wealthy family?

1666
01:43:52,775 --> 01:43:55,010
You're a foreigner. American.

1667
01:43:55,012 --> 01:43:59,580
And all Americans think about
is their own happiness.

1668
01:43:59,582 --> 01:44:01,582
Don't you want
Nick to be happy?

1669
01:44:01,584 --> 01:44:03,751
It's an illusion.

1670
01:44:03,753 --> 01:44:07,189
We understand
how to build things that last.

1671
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:09,259
Something you know
nothing about.

1672
01:44:11,929 --> 01:44:13,761
You don't know me.

1673
01:44:13,763 --> 01:44:16,300
I know you're not
what Nick needs.

1674
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:23,073
Well, he proposed
to me yesterday.

1675
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:30,512
He said he'd walk away
from his family

1676
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:32,648
and from you for good.

1677
01:44:36,587 --> 01:44:38,355
Don't worry.
I turned him down.

1678
01:44:42,825 --> 01:44:44,926
Only a fool
folds a winning hand.

1679
01:44:44,928 --> 01:44:50,098
There's no winning.
You made sure of that.

1680
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,403
Because if Nick chose me,
he would lose his family.

1681
01:44:55,805 --> 01:44:58,106
And if he chose his family,

1682
01:44:58,108 --> 01:45:01,677
he might spend the rest
of his life resenting you.

1683
01:45:21,632 --> 01:45:24,698
So you chose for him.

1684
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,135
I'm not leaving
'cause I'm scared

1685
01:45:27,137 --> 01:45:29,871
or because I think
I'm not enough.

1686
01:45:29,873 --> 01:45:34,311
Because maybe for the first
time in my life,

1687
01:45:35,312 --> 01:45:36,914
I know I am.

1688
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:41,682
I just love Nick so much.

1689
01:45:41,684 --> 01:45:44,687
I don't want him
to lose his mom again.

1690
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:54,029
So I just wanted you
to know that one day,

1691
01:45:54,031 --> 01:45:56,464
when he marries
another lucky girl

1692
01:45:56,466 --> 01:45:58,902
who is enough for you,

1693
01:46:00,803 --> 01:46:02,836
and you're playing
with your grandkids

1694
01:46:02,838 --> 01:46:04,738
while the <i>tan huas</i>
are blooming

1695
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:07,211
and the birds are chirping,

1696
01:46:08,145 --> 01:46:11,745
that it was because of me.

1697
01:46:11,747 --> 01:46:15,951
A poor,
raised by a single mother,

1698
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:21,824
low class, immigrant nobody.

1699
01:46:59,396 --> 01:47:00,996
Hey.

1700
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,797
I'm gonna send someone
for the rest of my stuff.

1701
01:47:03,799 --> 01:47:05,166
But I wanna talk to you

1702
01:47:05,168 --> 01:47:06,368
about my visitation rights
with Cassian.

1703
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:07,437
Stop talking.

1704
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:09,304
What?

1705
01:47:09,306 --> 01:47:11,373
Don't worry
about packing your things.

1706
01:47:11,375 --> 01:47:15,410
You bought this apartment,
you keep it. We're leaving.

1707
01:47:15,412 --> 01:47:16,810
What do you mean
you're leaving?

1708
01:47:16,812 --> 01:47:18,213
Where are you gonna go?

1709
01:47:18,215 --> 01:47:20,749
I have 14 apartment
buildings that I own,

1710
01:47:20,751 --> 01:47:24,185
so probably one of those.

1711
01:47:24,187 --> 01:47:25,754
And you'll see Cassian
when it's good for him,

1712
01:47:25,756 --> 01:47:27,224
not when it's good for you.

1713
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:30,892
Hey!

1714
01:47:30,894 --> 01:47:32,727
Look, you know,
it's not just my fault

1715
01:47:32,729 --> 01:47:34,828
that things didn't work out.

1716
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:39,067
You're right. I shouldn't have
kept things from you.

1717
01:47:39,069 --> 01:47:41,936
Hidden my shoes,
turned down jobs,

1718
01:47:41,938 --> 01:47:43,571
charity work,
worrying that it might

1719
01:47:43,573 --> 01:47:45,573
make you feel lesser than.

1720
01:47:45,575 --> 01:47:47,375
But let's be clear.

1721
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,512
The problem with our marriage
isn't my family's money.

1722
01:47:50,514 --> 01:47:54,584
It's that you're a coward.
You gave up on us.

1723
01:47:55,986 --> 01:47:57,419
But I've just realized,

1724
01:47:57,421 --> 01:48:01,189
it's not my job
to make you feel like a man.

1725
01:48:01,191 --> 01:48:04,194
I can't make you
something you're not.

1726
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,167
Good for you!

1727
01:48:12,169 --> 01:48:14,002
Walking away from Nick

1728
01:48:14,004 --> 01:48:18,306
and his family's fat-ass
property portfolio.

1729
01:48:18,308 --> 01:48:22,711
You have no one,
no net worth,

1730
01:48:22,713 --> 01:48:27,048
but you have integrity.
That's why I respect you.

1731
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:29,086
Thank you for everything.

1732
01:49:04,354 --> 01:49:07,891
- Bye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye and thank you.

1733
01:49:09,259 --> 01:49:11,359
Sure I can't get you to stay?

1734
01:49:11,361 --> 01:49:14,231
You know, my brother P.T.,
he's still single.

1735
01:49:27,511 --> 01:49:29,379
All right.

1736
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:09,119
Rachel!

1737
01:50:10,153 --> 01:50:14,456
Rachel! Stay there.

1738
01:50:14,458 --> 01:50:18,195
I'm gonna go and look
for some extra blankets.

1739
01:50:20,063 --> 01:50:21,663
Hello.

1740
01:50:21,665 --> 01:50:25,200
Sorry, just one second.
Nick, what are you doing here?

1741
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:27,268
I'm flying back
to New York with you.

1742
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:29,905
God, don't make this harder
than it already is.

1743
01:50:29,907 --> 01:50:31,439
I always imagined what me

1744
01:50:31,441 --> 01:50:33,508
proposing to you
would be like.

1745
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:36,544
You know what?
I had it all planned out.

1746
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:37,645
Oh!

1747
01:50:37,647 --> 01:50:39,747
I'm right behind you.
Don't mind me.

1748
01:50:39,749 --> 01:50:42,517
I'd bring you to my favorite
spot on the island.

1749
01:50:42,519 --> 01:50:45,153
There's a hidden trail that
I used to go to as a child.

1750
01:50:45,155 --> 01:50:46,488
Now there's a cove there

1751
01:50:46,490 --> 01:50:49,557
that opens up
to this beautiful lake.

1752
01:50:49,559 --> 01:50:51,159
Um... Sorry, dude.

1753
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:53,029
Give me a second.

1754
01:50:55,298 --> 01:50:59,501
When the sun hits the horizon,
I'd get down on one knee.

1755
01:51:00,637 --> 01:51:03,171
And the rest of the world
would fall away.

1756
01:51:03,173 --> 01:51:04,772
Because it would
just be you...

1757
01:51:06,276 --> 01:51:07,910
Because it's just you...

1758
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:09,410
Sorry,
I can help you with that.

1759
01:51:09,412 --> 01:51:11,279
All right, it's fine.
Stay there.

1760
01:51:11,281 --> 01:51:14,349
Yay. You, too?
Watch your fingers.

1761
01:51:14,351 --> 01:51:16,084
- Lift it up. Okay.
- Thank you.

1762
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:18,286
Everybody okay?

1763
01:51:18,288 --> 01:51:20,956
Because I just need 30 seconds
with this woman.

1764
01:51:20,958 --> 01:51:22,858
Okay, thank you.

1765
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,360
Oh. Coming through. Sorry.

1766
01:51:25,362 --> 01:51:28,864
I know this is a far throw
from a hidden paradise.

1767
01:51:30,267 --> 01:51:32,135
But wherever
you are in the world,

1768
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,638
that's where I belong.

1769
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,574
But I...

1770
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:45,115
Rachel Chu,

1771
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:48,049
will you marry me?

1772
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:53,288
And make me the happiest man
in this world?

1773
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:56,493
Yes! Yes! Yes!
She will marry you!

1774
01:51:57,093 --> 01:51:58,560
Yes!

1775
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:01,530
Oh!

1776
01:52:12,275 --> 01:52:15,978
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1777
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:19,581
This is gonna be
some flight back to New York.

1778
01:52:19,583 --> 01:52:22,786
Well, I was actually thinking
about staying one more night.

1779
01:52:35,967 --> 01:52:38,067
It's all about you, Nick!

1780
01:53:20,844 --> 01:53:23,713
Make babies! Make babies!
