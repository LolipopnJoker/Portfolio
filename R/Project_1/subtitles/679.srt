And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,912
Dr. Steven Kaplan,

233
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,834
who says that
the investigations the Warrens conducted

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,390
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.

235
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,999
Why is that?

236
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,034
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

237
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,776
- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.

238
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,835
Yes, it has.

239
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,399
The Lutz family made everything up

240
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,516
so they could profit off
of all the publicity.

241
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,113
That's just not true.

242
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,952
Look, we see this all the time.

243
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,357
It's very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story.

244
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,919
But it's something very different

245
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,156
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself.

she was making that voice

1116
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,277
it was in front of television cameras.

And what about Peggy?

1128

She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse

to get better housing from the council.
