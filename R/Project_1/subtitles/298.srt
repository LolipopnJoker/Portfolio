1
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,448
Mathematicians won the war.

2
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:36,494
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes

3
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,705
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,916
Mathematicians, like you.

5
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:47,622
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

6
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:51,793
In medicine or economics,
in technology or space

7
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:53,720
battle lines are being drawn.

8
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:57,507
To triumph, we need results,

9
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:00,226
publishable, applicable results.

10
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,938
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

11
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,607
The next Einstein?

12
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:10,353
Who among you will be the
vanguard of democracy,

13
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:12,280
freedom, and discovery?

14
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:17,452
Today, we bequeath America's
future into your able hands.

15
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,664
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

16
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,092
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

17
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:43,436
No, he has to have it all for himself.

18
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:47,690
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

19
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,851
He's got his
sights set on Wheeler Lab,

20
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:51,986
the new military
think-tank at MIT.

21
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:54,781
They're only taking one this year.

22
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,649
Hansen's used to being picked first.

23
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,401
Yeah, he's wasted on math.

24
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:00,953
He should be running for president.

25
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,758
There could be a mathematical
explanation for how bad your tie is.

26
00:03:19,924 --> 00:03:21,557
Thank you.

27
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:24,677
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

28
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:27,639
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.

29
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,691
At least that's what he
tells the girls, eh, Neils?

30
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,977
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

31
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:34,521
And you are?
Am I late?

32
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:36,231
Yes, Mr. Sol.

33
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:38,157
Good. Hi.

34
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,235
Sol. Richard Sol.

35
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:41,903
Ah, the burden of genius.

36
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:42,946
There he is.

37
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,072
So many supplicants,
and so little time.

38
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,907
Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

39
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,367
Bender.
Nice to see you.

40
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,576
Congratulations,
Mr. Hansen.

41
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,002
Thank you.

42
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,380
I'll take another.

43
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:54,916
Excuse me?

44
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:57,001
A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed you were the waiter.

45
00:03:57,002 --> 00:03:58,086
Play nice, Hansen.

46
00:03:58,087 --> 00:03:59,712
Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

47
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:00,964
An honest mistake.

48
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:03,057
Well, Martin Hansen.

49
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,810
It is Martin, isn't it?

50
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:08,304
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:10,982
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:18,739
I've read your preprints,
both of them.

53
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:23,653
The one on Nazi ciphers and the
other one on nonlinear equations.

54
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:27,156
And I am supremely confident that
there is not a single seminal

55
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:29,125
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

56
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,422
Enjoy your punch.

57
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:43,389
Gentlemen, meet John Nash, the
mysterious West Virginia genius.

58
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:46,634
The other winner of the
distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

59
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:48,011
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, yeah?

60
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,729
Of course.

61
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,137
Oh, Christ.

62
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:26,891
The prodigal roommate arrives.

63
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:29,469
Roommate?

64
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,978
Oh, God, no.

65
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:36,684
Did you know that having a hangover

66
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,145
is not having enough
water in your body

67
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:41,814
to run your Krebs cycle?

68
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:45,368
Which is exactly what happens to
you when you're dying of thirst.

69
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,788
So, dying of thirst

70
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:52,533
would probably feel

71
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:57,338
pretty much like the hangover
that finally bloody kills you.

72
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,500
John Nash?

73
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,968
Hello.

74
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,929
Charles Herman.
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:17,358
All right! Well done!

76
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:25,700
Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

77
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:30,079
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.
His name was Johnnie Walker.

78
00:06:35,953 --> 00:06:38,121
Well, I got in last night in time

79
00:06:38,122 --> 00:06:40,506
for English department cocktails.

80
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,458
Cock was mine,

81
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:45,511
the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion

82
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:50,883
for D. H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?

83
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,218
I'm here to work.

84
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,687
Are you? Right.
I see. Crikey!

85
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,408
Is my roommate a dick?

86
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:10,536
Hmm?

87
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,665
Listen. If we can't
break the ice,

88
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,543
how about we drown it?

89
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,805
So what's your story?

90
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:33,934
You the poor kid that never got
to go to Exeter or Andover?

91
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,930
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm actually quite well-balanced.

92
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,732
I have a chip on both shoulders.

93
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:45,488
Maybe you're just better with the old
integers than you are with people.

94
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,148
My first grade teacher, she told me

95
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:49,025
that I was born with
two helpings of brain

96
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:51,160
but only half a helping of heart.

97
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,955
Wow!
She sounds lovely!

98
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:59,502
The truth is that
I don't like people much.

99
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:02,413
And they don't much like me.

100
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:05,257
But why, with all your
obvious wit and charm?

101
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,637
Seriously, John.

102
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,932
Mathematics.

103
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:17,053
Mathematics is never going to
lead you to a higher truth.

104
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:18,979
And you know why?

105
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:22,108
Because it's boring.
It's really boring.

106
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,528
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?

107
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:31,117
I cannot waste time with these
classes and these books.

108
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,081
Memorizing the weak assumptions
of lesser mortals!

109
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:44,338
I need to look through
to the governing dynamics.

110
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:50,344
Find a truly original idea.

111
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,047
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

112
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:55,015
It's the only way that I'll ever...
Matter.

113
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,187
Yes.

114
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:03,307
All right, who's next?

115
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,976
I've played enough Go for one day.

116
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,978
Come on.
I hate this game.

117
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,729
Cowards, all of you!

118
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,898
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

119
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,569
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins, Sol
does his laundry all semester.

120
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,329
Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
Not at all.

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,867
Look at him.

122
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,118
Nash!

123
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,661
Taking a reverse constitutional?

124
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,714
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.

125
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:31,886
Oh.

126
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,304
Psycho.

127
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,840
Nash, I thought you dropped out.

128
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,349
You ever going to go to class or...

129
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,227
Classes will dull your mind.

130
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,230
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

131
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,308
Oh, I didn't know that.

132
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:48,068
Nash is going to stun
us all with his genius.

133
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:51,614
Which is another way of saying he
doesn't have the nerve to compete.

134
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:54,942
You scared?

135
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,403
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.

136
00:09:57,404 --> 00:09:58,746
Stupefied by you.

137
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,283
No starch.

138
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:03,918
Pressed and folded.

139
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,248
Let me ask you something, John.

140
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:11,042
Be my guest, Martin.

141
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,543
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed

142
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,962
Allen's proof of Perron's conjecture.

143
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:18,966
Adequate work without innovation.

144
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,718
Oh, I'm flattered.
You flattered?

145
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,136
Flattered.

146
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,888
And I've got two weapons briefs

147
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,307
under security review by the DoD.

148
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:28,275
Derivative drivel.

149
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:32,780
But Nash achievements, zero.

150
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:36,242
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?

151
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:41,288
What if you never come up
with your original idea, huh?

152
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:47,294
How will it feel when I'm chosen
for Wheeler and you're not?

153
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,133
What if you lose?

154
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:05,479
You should not have won.

155
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,517
I had the first move,
my play was perfect.

156
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,227
The hubris of the defeated.

157
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:12,820
The game is flawed.

158
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:14,989
Oh!

159
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:22,413
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

160
00:11:28,578 --> 00:11:31,463
You've been in here for two days.

161
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,468
You know Hansen has just
published another paper?

162
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,138
I can't even find
a topic for my doctorate.

163
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,393
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

164
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:48,564
This is a group
playing touch football.

165
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:52,568
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.

166
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:58,616
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

167
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,870
John, you watched a mugging.
That's weird.

168
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:06,157
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

169
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,577
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

170
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,630
See, if I could derive an equilibrium

171
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:17,760
where prevalence is a non-singular
event, where nobody loses.

172
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:21,630
Can you imagine the effect that that
would have on conflict scenarios...

173
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,134
When did you last eat?

174
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,260
Currency exchange?

175
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,062
You know, food.

176
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,308
You have no respect for cognitive
reverie, you know that?

177
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,943
Yes. But pizza...

178
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:39,365
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

179
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,493
And, of course, beer.

180
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,250
I have respect for beer.

181
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,296
I have respect for beer!

182
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:04,590
Good evening, Neils. Ladies. Hey, Nash.

183
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,725
Who's winning? You or you?

184
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:08,469
Good evening, Nash.

185
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,229
Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

186
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,899
He's looking at you for sure.

187
00:13:13,975 --> 00:13:15,351
Me?

188
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:16,652
Nash.

189
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:22,199
Hey, Nash. Neils is trying
to get your attention.

190
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,535
- You're joking.
- Oh, no.

191
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,459
Go with God.
Come back a man.

192
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,246
Fortune favors the brave.

193
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,797
Bombs away.

194
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,336
Gentlemen, might I remind
you that my odds of success

195
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:44,638
dramatically improve
with each attempt?

196
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,066
This is going to be classic.

197
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,348
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

198
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:35,848
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

199
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:38,559
in order for you to
have intercourse with me,

200
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,903
but could we assume
that I've said all that?

201
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:44,565
Essentially, we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

202
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,867
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

203
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,078
That was sweet.

204
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:53,324
Have a nice night, asshole!

205
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,375
Ladies, wait!

206
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,217
I especially liked the bit about fluid exchange.
It was really charming.

207
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:11,391
Walk with me, John.
I've been meaning to talk with you.

208
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:16,263
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

209
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,766
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

210
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,768
Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.

211
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,436
And, actually, I don't really
have a second choice, sir.

212
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:25,606
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

213
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:27,908
They've written papers.
They've published.

214
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,153
Oh, I'm still searching, sir, for my...
Your original idea.

215
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:32,613
Governing dynamics, sir.

216
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,156
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid

217
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:35,916
it's just not nearly good enough.

218
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,550
May I?
Thank you.

219
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,002
I've been working on
manifold embedding.

220
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,255
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

221
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:50,965
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

222
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,092
if you would be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein.

223
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:54,635
I've repeatedly asked you for that, sir.
Now, John...

224
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:57,137
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

225
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,522
John.

226
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,609
Do you see what
they're doing in there?

227
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:08,232
Congratulations, Professor.

228
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,576
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

229
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,737
It's the pens.

230
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:17,624
Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.

231
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:20,294
Now what do you see, John?

232
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,963
Recognition.

233
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,008
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

234
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,801
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

235
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,004
Is there a difference?

236
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:33,473
John, you haven't focused.

237
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:38,387
I'm sorry, but up to this point,

238
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,064
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

239
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,153
Good day.

240
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:58,824
And my compliments to you, sir.

241
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:00,250
Thank you so much.

242
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,519
I can't see it.

243
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:29,404
Jesus Christ, John.

244
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,398
I can't fail.

245
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,691
This is all I am.

246
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,234
Come on, let's go out.

247
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,653
I have to get something done.

248
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,030
I can't keep staring into space.

249
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,281
John, that's enough!

250
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:40,991
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,

251
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,326
read their books, do their classes.

252
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,079
You wanna do some damage, that's
fine, but don't mess around.

253
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,049
Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.

254
00:17:49,376 --> 00:17:51,877
John, do it.
Don't mess around.

255
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:55,756
Bust your head! Go on, bust
that worthless head wide open.

256
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:59,059
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?

257
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,647
It's not my problem.

258
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,567
And it's not your problem.

259
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,322
It's their problem.

260
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:15,867
Your answer isn't,
"Face the wall."

261
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:19,830
It's out there,
where you've been working.

262
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,603
That was heavy.

263
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:49,226
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

264
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:52,070
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

265
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,365
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

266
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,534
Oh, God!

267
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,665
Incoming, gentlemen.

268
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,464
Deep breaths.

269
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:15,218
Nash, you might want to stop shuffling
your papers for five seconds.

270
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,175
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

271
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,310
We're not here for beer, my friend.

272
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:26,938
Oh.

273
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:31,068
Does anyone else feel she should
be moving in slow motion?

274
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,237
Will she want a large
wedding, you think?

275
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:36,523
Shall we say swords?
Pistols at dawn?

276
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,026
Have you remembered nothing?

277
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:40,986
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,

278
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:43,121
the father of modern economics.

279
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:47,534
"In competition, individual
ambition serves the common good."

280
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:48,702
Exactly!

281
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,995
Every man for himself, gentlemen.

282
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:52,956
Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

283
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm not going to strike out.

284
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:57,344
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

285
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,254
All right, nobody move.

286
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:02,057
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

287
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:04,843
Oh, God. All right, he may
have the upper hand now,

288
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:06,220
but wait until he opens his mouth.

289
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,388
Remember the last time?

290
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,733
Oh, yes. That was one
for the history books.

291
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,024
Adam Smith needs revision.

292
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,909
What are you talking about?

293
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:23,954
If we all go for the blonde,

294
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,418
we block each other.

295
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:34,047
Not a single one of us
is going to get her.

296
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:36,341
So then we go for her friends,

297
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,920
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder

298
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:42,097
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

299
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:45,976
Well, what if no one
goes for the blonde?

300
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:49,638
We don't get in each other's way

301
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,065
and we don't insult the other girls.

302
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,402
That's the only way we win.

303
00:20:57,772 --> 00:20:59,573
That's the only way we all get laid.

304
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:09,416
Adam Smith said,
"The best result comes

305
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,244
"from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself."

306
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:16,590
Right? That's what he said. That's right.
Incomplete. Incomplete, okay?

307
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:22,262
Because the best result will
come from everyone in the group

308
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:26,466
doing what's best for
himself and the group.

309
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,176
Nash, if this is
some way for you to get

310
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:30,137
the blonde on your own,
you can go to hell.

311
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:32,639
Governing dynamics, gentlemen.
Governing dynamics.

312
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,692
Adam Smith was wrong.

313
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,945
Here we go.
Careful, careful.

314
00:21:41,983 --> 00:21:43,700
Thank you.

315
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,548
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

316
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,604
You do realize this flies in the face

317
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:04,648
of 150 years of economic theory?

318
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,899
Yes, I do, sir.

319
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,359
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

320
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,785
It is, sir.

321
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:20,672
Well, Mr. Nash, with a
breakthrough of this magnitude,

322
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,384
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

323
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:36,730
Wheeler Labs, they'll ask you
to recommend two team members.

324
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:42,686
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

325
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,738
Sol and Bender, sir.

326
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:48,074
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

327
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:49,818
Has it occurred to you,
Mr. Nash,

328
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,995
that Sol and Bender might
have plans of their own?

329
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:58,702
We made it!

330
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,962
Wheeler, we made it!

331
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:03,373
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

332
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:04,924
Oh! Oh!

333
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:08,011
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

334
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,496
Governing dynamics.

335
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,867
Congratulations, John.

336
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,452
Toast!
To Wheeler Labs!

337
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,170
To Wheeler!

338
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:09,648
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

339
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:11,441
Dr. Nash, your coat?

340
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,284
Thank you, sir.

341
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:14,736
Doctor.

342
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:17,330
General, this is Wheeler team leader, Dr.
John Nash.

343
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,491
Glad you could come, Doctor.

344
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:20,792
Hello.

345
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,419
Right this way.

346
00:25:23,037 --> 00:25:26,589
We've been intercepting radio
transmissions from Moscow.

347
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:30,844
The computer can't detect a
pattern, but I'm sure it's code.

348
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:33,304
Why is that, General?

349
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:36,141
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

350
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:40,311
Constantly.

351
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,899
We've developed several ciphers.

352
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:49,112
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data?

353
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:52,190
Doctor?

354
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:56,278
6-7-3-7. 0-3-6...

355
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,946
8-4-9-4.

356
00:25:57,947 --> 00:26:00,373
9-1-4-0-3-4.

357
00:26:42,283 --> 00:26:43,625
0-3-4.

358
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:02,685
I need a map.

359
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:09,442
46-13-08, 67-46-90.

360
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:13,404
Starkey Corners, Maine.

361
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:19,619
48-03-01. 91-26-35.

362
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,656
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

363
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:25,041
These are latitudes and longitudes.

364
00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:26,993
There are at least 10 others.

365
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:30,213
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the US.

366
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,508
Extraordinary.

367
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:37,220
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

368
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,924
Who's Big Brother?

369
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,643
You've done your country
a great service, son.

370
00:27:43,886 --> 00:27:45,937
Captain!
Yes, sir.

371
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,232
Accompany Dr. Nash.

372
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:51,109
What are the Russians moving, General?

373
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,064
Captain Rogers will escort you to
the unrestricted area, Doctor.

374
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,699
Thank you.

375
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,867
Dr. Nash,
follow me, please.

376
00:28:07,243 --> 00:28:10,412
None of those who have said
they don't like the method

377
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:14,090
have told us any other method they
could use that would be effective.

378
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:17,343
- It's Dr. Nash.
- All right.

379
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:34,352
Thank you, sir.
Home run at the Pentagon, huh?

380
00:28:34,353 --> 00:28:37,530
Have they actually taken the word
"classified" out of the dictionary?

381
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,775
Hi. The air conditioning
broke again.

382
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:43,403
How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?

383
00:28:43,404 --> 00:28:45,496
Our hearts go out to you, John.

384
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:49,075
You know, two trips to the
Pentagon in four years.

385
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:50,410
That's two more than we've had.

386
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:51,786
It gets better, John.

387
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:54,047
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

388
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:56,583
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

389
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,169
the Nazis are
repatriating South America,

390
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,888
the Chinese have a standing
army of 2.8 million,

391
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:05,350
and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

392
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,303
Look, you made the cover
of Fortune again.

393
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:10,730
Please note the use of
the word "you," not "we."

394
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,941
That was supposed to be just me.

395
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:19,439
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,

396
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,817
now they put me on the cover of
Fortune magazine with these hacks,

397
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,277
these scholars of trivia.

398
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:26,029
John, exactly what is the difference

399
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,955
between genius and most genius?

400
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:30,958
Quite a lot.

401
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,494
He's your son.

402
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,087
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.

403
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,247
I've always got 10 minutes.

404
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:37,757
Before your new class?

405
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:46,307
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

406
00:29:47,343 --> 00:29:49,936
You are a doctor, John, and no.

407
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:53,306
Come on. You know the drill, we
get these beautiful facilities...

408
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:55,308
MIT gets America's
great minds of today

409
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:57,102
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

410
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,603
Poor bastards.

411
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:00,605
Now, have a nice day at school.

412
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:02,115
The bell is ringing.

413
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:26,764
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

414
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,736
Can we leave one open, Professor?
It's really hot, sir.

415
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,492
Your comfort comes second to my
ability to hear my own voice.

416
00:30:51,198 --> 00:30:56,836
Personally, I think this class
will be a waste of your,

417
00:30:56,871 --> 00:30:59,505
and what is infinitely worse,

418
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,508
my time.

419
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:07,221
However, here we are.

420
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:10,308
So, you may attend or not.

421
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,186
You may complete your
assignments at your whim.

422
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:15,188
We have begun.

423
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,233
Miss.

424
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,780
Excuse me!

425
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,657
Excuse me!
Hey, hey!

426
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:28,201
Hi!

427
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,696
We have a little problem.

428
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:34,282
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed

429
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:37,076
and extremely noisy with them open.

430
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,454
So I was wondering if there
was any way you could,

431
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:43,166
I don't know, maybe work someplace
else for about 45 minutes?

432
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,375
Not a problem.

433
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:46,127
Thank you so much!

434
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:48,012
- Break!
- Got it!

435
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:51,140
Let's go.
Clean it up a little bit.

436
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:56,187
As you will find in multivariable
calculus, there is often

437
00:31:57,389 --> 00:31:59,982
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

438
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,113
As I was saying, this problem here

439
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,784
will take some of you
many months to solve.

440
00:32:10,444 --> 00:32:12,662
For others among you,

441
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:16,707
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

442
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:32,974
Professor Nash.

443
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,405
William Parcher.

444
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,282
Big Brother,

445
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:52,785
at your service.

446
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:55,863
What can I do for the
Department of Defense?

447
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:57,282
Are you here to give me a raise?

448
00:32:57,283 --> 00:32:59,250
Let's take a walk.

449
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:01,953
Impressive work at the Pentagon.

450
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:03,538
Yes, it was.

451
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,375
Oppenheimer used to say, "Genius sees
the answer before the question."

452
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:09,377
You knew Oppenheimer?

453
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:12,338
His project was under my supervision.

454
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:14,140
Which project?

455
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:18,011
That project.

456
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:19,812
It's not that simple, you know?

457
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,431
Well, you ended the war.

458
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:25,018
We incinerated 150,000
people in a heartbeat.

459
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:28,112
Great deeds come at
great cost, Mr. Parcher.

460
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:31,482
Conviction, it turns out,

461
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:35,244
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

462
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,123
I'll try and keep that in mind.

463
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:44,170
So, John, no family,

464
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,789
no close friends.

465
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,124
Why is that?

466
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,010
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

467
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:55,014
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

468
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,383
Well, there are certain endeavors

469
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:58,885
where your lack of personal connection

470
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:01,437
would be considered an advantage.

471
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,932
This is a secure area.

472
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:07,068
They know me.

473
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:10,938
Have you ever been here?

474
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,649
We were told during
our initial briefing

475
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,734
that these warehouses were abandoned.

476
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:17,244
That's not precisely accurate.

477
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:55,942
By telling you what
I'm about to tell you,

478
00:34:55,943 --> 00:34:59,612
I am increasing your security
clearance to top secret.

479
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:03,741
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

480
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:05,084
Get it?

481
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:07,211
What operation?

482
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,885
Those are a good idea.

483
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,268
This factory is in Berlin.
We seized it at the end of the war.

484
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:26,514
Nazi engineers were attempting
to build a portable atomic bomb.

485
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,725
The Soviets reached this
facility before we did,

486
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,359
and we lost the damn thing.

487
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:35,614
The routing orders at the Pentagon.

488
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,825
They were about this, weren't they?

489
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:41,571
The Soviets aren't as
unified as people believe.

490
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:45,241
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda,

491
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,368
the "New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb

492
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,588
and intends to
detonate it on U.S. soil.

493
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:53,966
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

494
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:02,808
Man is capable of as much
atrocity as he has imagination.

495
00:36:04,678 --> 00:36:07,980
New Freedom has sleeper
agents here in the U.S.

496
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,319
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.

497
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:16,939
New Freedom communicates to its agents

498
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,109
through codes imbedded in
newspapers and magazines,

499
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,494
and that's where you come in.

500
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:25,706
You see, John, what distinguishes you

501
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:29,251
is that you are, quite simply,

502
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:33,589
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

503
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:42,389
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

504
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:50,314
Commit this list of
periodicals to memory.

505
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:56,570
Scan each new issue, find any
hidden codes, decipher them.

506
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:01,067
Place your chin on the chin rest.

507
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:02,527
Stare into the light.

508
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:04,829
Pulse 88, regular.

509
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:10,209
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

510
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:15,623
It's got a little zap
to it, doesn't it?

511
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:18,543
He just implanted a radium diode.

512
00:37:18,544 --> 00:37:20,511
Don't worry, it's safe.

513
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,256
The isotope decays predictably.

514
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:26,475
As a result, these numbers
change over time.

515
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,020
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

516
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,733
So what am I now, a spy?

517
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:48,873
Come.

518
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,588
Boy, you must be really important.

519
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,723
It's all right, Mike.

520
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,442
What are you working on?

521
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,446
Classified.

522
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:23,316
Everyone waited half an hour.

523
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:24,950
For?

524
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,286
Class.

525
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,747
You missed class today.

526
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:32,583
Well, I suspect that

527
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,462
nobody missed me.

528
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,465
The problem that you
left on the board...

529
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,259
I solved it.

530
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:44,879
No, you didn't.

531
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,430
You didn't even look.

532
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:50,517
I never said that the vector
fields were rational functions.

533
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,107
Your solution is elegant.

534
00:38:59,311 --> 00:39:02,196
Though on this particular occasion

535
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:05,074
ultimately incorrect.

536
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,005
You're still here.

537
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:29,848
I'm still here.

538
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:32,309
Why?

539
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:36,272
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,

540
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:39,525
if I can ask you to dinner.

541
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,739
You do eat, don't you?

542
00:39:45,899 --> 00:39:47,866
On occasion, yeah.

543
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:50,778
Table for one.
Prometheus alone, chained to the rock

544
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:53,372
with the bird circling
overhead, you know how it is.

545
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:59,044
No, I expect that you wouldn't know.

546
00:40:02,582 --> 00:40:05,084
Leave your address with my office.

547
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:10,264
I'll pick you up Friday
at 8:00 and we'll eat.

548
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:20,766
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

549
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:23,110
or should I just
keep calling you "miss"?

550
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,065
Governor, may I present...

551
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:30,409
Miss Alicia Larde.
Miss Alicia Larde.

552
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:34,079
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

553
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,958
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:43,289
I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.

555
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,508
So, you boys need to look good,

556
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:52,431
which is not a state you find
yourselves in altogether naturally.

557
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,270
There. Better.

558
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:00,639
I'm surprising him.

559
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,859
You just keep on
surprising him. Professor.

560
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,629
God must be a painter.

561
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,965
Why else would we have so many colors?

562
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:31,303
So you're a painter?

563
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:34,890
That's not actually what I said,

564
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:39,269
but, yes, I am.

565
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:49,822
Here.

566
00:41:50,982 --> 00:41:53,826
Me. Your date.

567
00:41:56,154 --> 00:41:58,823
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

568
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:01,625
That's a plan.

569
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:06,547
Champagne would be lovely.

570
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,342
I'll be outside.

571
00:42:10,627 --> 00:42:12,928
I will get the champagne.

572
00:42:21,221 --> 00:42:23,021
Oh, thank you.

573
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:25,724
Thank you for that.

574
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,852
No, keep it.

575
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,904
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.

576
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:33,073
Do you?

577
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:34,867
No.

578
00:42:35,277 --> 00:42:37,536
I don't believe in luck.

579
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:44,460
But I do believe in
assigning value to things.

580
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:46,879
Oh.

581
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,473
I once tried to count them all.

582
00:42:58,425 --> 00:43:02,853
I actually made it to 4,348.

583
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,732
You are exceptionally odd.

584
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,235
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

585
00:43:15,775 --> 00:43:18,118
A pair of odd ducks, then.

586
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,370
Mmm.

587
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,250
Pick a shape.

588
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,420
What?

589
00:43:29,247 --> 00:43:32,257
Pick a shape, an animal, anything.

590
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,886
Okay.

591
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:38,514
An umbrella.

592
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:20,005
Do it again.

593
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:22,007
All right.
What would you like?

594
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:24,184
Do an octopus.

595
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:17,182
You don't talk much, do you?

596
00:47:17,183 --> 00:47:20,318
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

597
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,738
I don't mean work.

598
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,319
I find that polishing my interactions

599
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,331
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

600
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:37,961
I have a tendency to
expedite information flow

601
00:47:39,414 --> 00:47:41,465
by being direct.

602
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,210
I often don't get a pleasant result.

603
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:46,720
Try me.

604
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:49,598
All right.

605
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,062
I find you attractive.

606
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,515
Your aggressive moves towards me

607
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,859
indicate that you feel the same way.

608
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:03,854
But still, ritual requires that

609
00:48:03,855 --> 00:48:06,364
we continue with a number
of platonic activities

610
00:48:06,524 --> 00:48:08,909
before we have sex.

611
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:12,070
I am proceeding with those activities,

612
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,239
but in point of actual fact,

613
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,002
all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

614
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:23,006
Are you going to slap me now?

615
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:49,407
How was that result?

616
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:08,426
What are you doing?

617
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:14,716
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences

618
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:18,053
within periodicals
over time. And you?

619
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:20,480
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

620
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:26,520
Do I know you?

621
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:28,855
My uncle says you're very smart

622
00:49:28,856 --> 00:49:30,399
but not very nice,

623
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,818
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

624
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,778
And who might your uncle be?

625
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:36,413
The prodigal roommate

626
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,374
returns.

627
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,547
Come here!
Charles, Charles.

628
00:49:50,962 --> 00:49:54,973
My sister got herself
killed in a car crash.

629
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:58,226
Not too far now, Marcee!

630
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,971
Her cowboy husband was too drunk

631
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:03,307
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

632
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,650
So, I took her in.

633
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:08,312
She's so small.

634
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:11,573
Well, she's young, John.
That's how they come.

635
00:50:13,026 --> 00:50:17,779
I'm at Harvard doing the
great author's workshop.

636
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,865
D. H. bloody Lawrence.

637
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:22,083
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

638
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:27,881
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

639
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,592
How are you, John?

640
00:50:31,085 --> 00:50:33,170
At first, all my work
here was trivial,

641
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,181
but a new assignment came up and...

642
00:50:37,383 --> 00:50:39,384
I can't really tell you any details.

643
00:50:39,385 --> 00:50:42,179
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

644
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,230
Something like that.

645
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:45,724
And...

646
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:47,359
Yes?

647
00:50:48,227 --> 00:50:50,195
Well, I met a girl.

648
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:52,397
No! A human girl?
Homo sapien.

649
00:50:52,398 --> 00:50:54,858
A biped? Yep.
And contrary to all probabilities,

650
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:58,570
she finds me attractive on a
number of different levels.

651
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:00,872
God, that's wonderful.

652
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:04,459
Well, there's no accounting
for taste, is there?

653
00:51:07,246 --> 00:51:08,664
Should I marry her?

654
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,298
God. Right.

655
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:13,502
I mean, everything's going well.

656
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,879
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

657
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,056
It all seems to add up.

658
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:20,976
But how do you know for sure?

659
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,522
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

660
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:28,525
That's the only sure thing I do know.

661
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,242
Good evening.

662
00:51:43,616 --> 00:51:47,752
Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work,

663
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,630
again.
Mmm-hmm.

664
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,758
I'm sorry.

665
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:56,553
I didn't have time to wrap it.

666
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:59,097
Happy birthday.

667
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,178
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

668
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:07,305
they create a full
wavelength dispersal,

669
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:08,640
so if you look inside it,
you can see...

670
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:09,766
Every possible color.

671
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:13,311
Every possible color.
Yeah.

672
00:52:13,312 --> 00:52:17,315
Remember you said that time, "God must
be a painter because of all the colors"?

673
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:19,826
At the governor's house,
you said that.

674
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:23,121
I didn't think you were listening.

675
00:52:25,616 --> 00:52:27,625
I was listening.

676
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:35,967
It's beautiful.

677
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:55,061
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

678
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:56,897
Because I need some kind of proof,

679
00:52:56,898 --> 00:52:59,991
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

680
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,249
I'm sorry, just give me a moment

681
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:13,004
to redefine my
girlish notions of romance.

682
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:17,842
A proof?

683
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:20,136
Verifiable data.

684
00:53:21,547 --> 00:53:22,931
Okay.

685
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,103
Well, how big is the universe?

686
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,013
Infinite.

687
00:53:30,014 --> 00:53:31,598
How do you know?

688
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,183
I know because all the data
indicates it's infinite.

689
00:53:33,184 --> 00:53:34,559
But it hasn't been proven yet? No.

690
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,644
You haven't seen it.
No.

691
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,112
How do you know for sure?

692
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:39,856
I don't, I just believe it.

693
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:41,324
Mmm.

694
00:53:43,236 --> 00:53:45,537
It's the same with love, I guess.

695
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,965
Now, the part that you don't know

696
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:01,845
is if I want to marry you.

697
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:24,659
Smile for the camera!

698
00:54:28,155 --> 00:54:29,789
Well done!

699
00:54:31,617 --> 00:54:33,418
Congratulations.

700
00:54:35,454 --> 00:54:37,463
You look beautiful.

701
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,008
Hi, how are you?

702
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:48,800
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, now.

703
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:51,136
- Bye!
- Bye!

704
00:54:51,137 --> 00:54:52,812
Be safe!

705
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,718
Get in. Hurry.

706
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:29,432
They're following us.

707
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:35,221
Who is...
Who is following us?

708
00:55:35,222 --> 00:55:36,981
The drop has been compromised.

709
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:39,150
Get down!

710
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:41,194
Stay down.

711
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:10,465
Here, take this.

712
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:11,591
I ain't shooting anybody.

713
00:56:11,592 --> 00:56:13,134
Take the goddamn gun!

714
00:56:13,135 --> 00:56:14,852
No!

715
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:35,081
You stay back.
Don't move.

716
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:23,588
John?

717
00:57:30,588 --> 00:57:32,055
Hi.

718
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:36,267
Where were you?

719
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:42,057
Sol...
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

720
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,984
He said you left the office hours ago.

721
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:49,822
Why didn't you call me?

722
00:57:54,361 --> 00:57:55,995
Are you all right?

723
00:58:05,122 --> 00:58:07,006
Honey?

724
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,967
John.

725
00:58:10,336 --> 00:58:13,304
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

726
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,516
John, open the door.

727
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:20,978
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

728
00:58:21,222 --> 00:58:22,897
Talk to me!

729
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:25,817
John!

730
00:58:26,602 --> 00:58:28,444
Open this door!

731
00:58:45,538 --> 00:58:47,630
Watch for cars, kids.

732
00:59:08,227 --> 00:59:10,278
What was that?

733
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:31,174
John.

734
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:33,759
William.

735
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:36,880
This is not what I signed up for.

736
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:38,840
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...

737
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:42,768
I understand better than you
could possibly imagine.

738
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,739
You need to calm down, John.

739
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,775
Now listen to me.
We're closing in on the bomb,

740
00:59:57,776 --> 00:59:59,944
in large part due to your work.

741
00:59:59,945 --> 01:00:02,914
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

742
01:00:03,282 --> 01:00:06,209
William, my circumstance has changed.

743
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:08,252
Alicia's pregnant.

744
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:19,472
I told you attachments were dangerous.

745
01:00:19,632 --> 01:00:22,099
You chose to marry the girl.

746
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:25,061
I did nothing to prevent it.

747
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:30,475
The best way to
ensure everybody's safety

748
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:32,777
is for you to continue your work.

749
01:00:33,729 --> 01:00:35,446
Well, I'll just quit.

750
01:00:35,606 --> 01:00:37,281
You won't.

751
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:38,608
Why would I not?

752
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:41,911
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

753
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:44,789
You quit working for me,

754
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:47,458
I quit working for you.

755
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:03,182
Parcher! Parcher!

756
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:09,855
John, you all right?

757
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:31,911
John?

758
01:01:31,912 --> 01:01:33,963
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

759
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:40,878
Why would you do that?
Why would you turn the light on?

760
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:42,505
What is wrong with you?

761
01:01:42,506 --> 01:01:44,890
You have to go to your sister's.

762
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:46,551
I left the car at the back.

763
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:48,678
Now you can take Commonwealth,
no side streets.

764
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:50,054
John...
Stay where it's crowded.

765
01:01:50,055 --> 01:01:52,015
John, I'm not going anywhere!

766
01:01:52,016 --> 01:01:53,933
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call.

767
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:55,018
No, I'm not going.

768
01:01:55,019 --> 01:01:56,394
Just get your things.
I'm not leaving!

769
01:01:56,395 --> 01:01:58,195
Stop! Stop it.

770
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:00,656
Please, Alicia.

771
01:02:02,693 --> 01:02:04,952
I'll explain when I can.

772
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:55,002
Uncle John!
Uncle John!

773
01:02:57,122 --> 01:03:00,174
Hey, baby girl!

774
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:03,511
Wow, someone needed a hug.

775
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:06,381
I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself,

776
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:10,351
"How can I miss seeing a guest lecture
by the inimitable John Nash?"

777
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:15,731
What's wrong?

778
01:03:18,102 --> 01:03:21,145
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

779
01:03:21,146 --> 01:03:23,239
Well, now you tell me, what is it?

780
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,282
Professor Nash!

781
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:27,410
Welcome!

782
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,663
After?

783
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:43,634
So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann zeta function

784
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:49,140
correspond to singularities
in space-time.

785
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:52,643
Singularities in
space-time then...

786
01:03:55,556 --> 01:03:58,315
And conventional number theory...

787
01:04:00,018 --> 01:04:04,196
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

788
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:24,550
Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.

789
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:30,765
Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.

790
01:04:50,235 --> 01:04:51,660
Professor Nash!

791
01:05:02,414 --> 01:05:03,456
Hold it!

792
01:05:03,457 --> 01:05:04,840
Professor Nash?

793
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:12,473
Professor Nash, let's
avoid a scene, shall we?

794
01:05:13,383 --> 01:05:14,892
What do you want?

795
01:05:15,385 --> 01:05:17,261
My name is Rosen.

796
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:19,597
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

797
01:05:19,598 --> 01:05:22,642
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

798
01:05:22,643 --> 01:05:25,444
I'd like you to come with me, John.

799
01:05:26,605 --> 01:05:28,489
Just for a chat.

800
01:05:29,566 --> 01:05:31,659
It appears I have no choice.

801
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:44,880
Help me! Somebody!

802
01:05:49,461 --> 01:05:51,387
Somebody! Help me!

803
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,714
Get off me!

804
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:55,800
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

805
01:05:55,801 --> 01:05:57,885
- No, no, no, don't!
- Charles!

806
01:05:57,886 --> 01:05:59,804
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

807
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:01,639
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

808
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,440
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

809
01:06:03,642 --> 01:06:05,150
Get away from me.

810
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:07,236
Stay away from me!

811
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:14,034
There, now.

812
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,954
All better.

813
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:22,793
Everything's all right here.

814
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:26,714
Watch your head.

815
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,120
John? John?

816
01:06:59,823 --> 01:07:01,749
Can you hear me?

817
01:07:15,714 --> 01:07:17,848
Go easy now.

818
01:07:17,883 --> 01:07:21,101
Thorazine takes
a little while to wear off.

819
01:07:23,764 --> 01:07:26,265
Sorry about the restraints.

820
01:07:26,266 --> 01:07:28,984
But you've got one
hell of a right hook.

821
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,946
Where am I?

822
01:07:33,857 --> 01:07:36,325
MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.

823
01:07:38,779 --> 01:07:40,996
I find that highly unlikely.

824
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,749
You made a mistake.

825
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:47,753
My work is non-military
in application.

826
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,381
Which work is that, John?

827
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,218
I don't know anything.

828
01:07:54,586 --> 01:07:57,388
There's no good in keeping
secrets, you know.

829
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:18,158
Charles?

830
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:22,079
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

831
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:25,249
I'm... I'm sorry.

832
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,922
Charles?

833
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:41,598
The prodigal roommate revealed.

834
01:08:44,928 --> 01:08:47,847
"Saw my name on the lecture slate"?

835
01:08:47,848 --> 01:08:49,773
You lying son of a bitch!

836
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,443
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

837
01:08:52,853 --> 01:08:54,812
How do you say "Charles
Herman" in Russian?

838
01:08:54,813 --> 01:08:56,488
How do you say it in Russian?

839
01:08:57,733 --> 01:08:59,116
There's no one there, John.

840
01:08:59,776 --> 01:09:00,985
There's no one there.

841
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:03,954
He's right there.
He's right there.

842
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:09,710
Stop! I don't know anything!
Stop! I don't know anything!

843
01:09:11,663 --> 01:09:15,499
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held against my will.

844
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,169
Somebody call the
Department of Defense.

845
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:22,598
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held against my will!

846
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:29,646
What's wrong with him?

847
01:09:32,517 --> 01:09:34,735
John has schizophrenia.

848
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:39,073
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

849
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,660
But... But his work.

850
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:46,288
He deals with conspiracy.
So...

851
01:09:47,365 --> 01:09:49,625
Yes. Yes, I know.

852
01:09:50,368 --> 01:09:55,005
In John's world, these behaviors
are accepted, encouraged.

853
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:59,084
As such, his illness may
have gone untreated

854
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:01,637
far longer than is typical.

855
01:10:02,047 --> 01:10:03,464
What do you mean?
How long?

856
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,599
Possibly since graduate school.

857
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:09,094
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

858
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:11,347
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

859
01:10:11,348 --> 01:10:14,141
One, so far, that I am aware of.

860
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:17,736
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

861
01:10:19,231 --> 01:10:21,065
Charles isn't imaginary.

862
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:23,192
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

863
01:10:23,193 --> 01:10:26,737
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

864
01:10:26,738 --> 01:10:29,573
He's always in town for so
little time, lecturing.

865
01:10:29,574 --> 01:10:30,866
Was he at your wedding?

866
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:32,076
He had to teach.

867
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:33,410
Have you seen a picture of him,

868
01:10:33,411 --> 01:10:34,745
or talked to him on the telephone?

869
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:36,956
This is ridiculous.

870
01:10:36,957 --> 01:10:39,007
I phoned Princeton.

871
01:10:39,376 --> 01:10:43,095
According to their housing
records, John lived alone.

872
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:49,218
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband,

873
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:51,428
a mathematician with
no military training,

874
01:10:51,429 --> 01:10:53,639
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

875
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,599
You're making him sound crazy.

876
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,944
Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

877
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:04,775
Now, the only way I can help him
is to show him the difference

878
01:11:04,776 --> 01:11:08,871
between what is real
and what is in his mind.

879
01:11:12,742 --> 01:11:14,251
Come on.

880
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:18,422
What's he been working on?

881
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:21,258
His work is classified.

882
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:26,338
He mentioned a supervisor by
the name of William Parcher.

883
01:11:26,339 --> 01:11:28,966
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

884
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:32,102
But I can't get to
him without clearances.

885
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:36,773
You want me to help you get the
details of my husband's work?

886
01:11:37,976 --> 01:11:42,070
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.
Is that what you think?

887
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:49,119
What did the doctor say?
Is he sick?

888
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:52,364
I don't know. I want to see
what John's been working on.

889
01:11:52,365 --> 01:11:54,325
Alicia, you know,
you can't go in his office.

890
01:11:54,326 --> 01:11:57,044
You know, it's classified,
Alicia. Stop.

891
01:12:11,009 --> 01:12:13,009
Oh, my God.

892
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:29,193
Why didn't you say something?

893
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:34,239
Alicia, I mean, John has
always been a little weird.

894
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:38,744
He said he was doing code-breaking.
That it was eyes-only.

895
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:42,247
Top-secret, part of the
military effort. Was he?

896
01:12:42,248 --> 01:12:44,124
Well, it was possible, you know?

897
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,709
I mean, directives
come down all the time

898
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,336
that some of us aren't cleared for.

899
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:48,837
It was possible.

900
01:12:48,838 --> 01:12:51,306
Possible, but not likely.

901
01:12:53,718 --> 01:12:58,305
Lately, he'd become so much more
agitated, and then when you called...

902
01:12:58,306 --> 01:13:01,892
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

903
01:13:01,893 --> 01:13:04,027
Cutting up magazines?

904
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:07,906
Well, not all.

905
01:14:29,647 --> 01:14:30,939
I'm so sorry.

906
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,407
It's okay.

907
01:14:35,987 --> 01:14:38,372
I missed you.

908
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,709
I have to talk to you.

909
01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:44,336
Okay.

910
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:52,002
Alicia, I've been thinking about it,

911
01:14:52,003 --> 01:14:55,214
and I do realize that my behavior

912
01:14:55,215 --> 01:14:59,051
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

913
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:03,605
must have appeared insane.
I left you with no other choice.

914
01:15:03,973 --> 01:15:06,934
I do understand, and I'm truly sorry.

915
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,194
That's okay.

916
01:15:10,188 --> 01:15:16,326
Everything is gonna be all right.

917
01:15:16,861 --> 01:15:19,329
We just have to talk quietly.

918
01:15:20,156 --> 01:15:24,292
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

919
01:15:24,869 --> 01:15:27,379
I'm gonna tell you everything now.

920
01:15:27,705 --> 01:15:31,341
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know

921
01:15:31,876 --> 01:15:35,637
because you have to
help me get out of here.

922
01:15:37,173 --> 01:15:40,259
Alicia, I've been doing top-secret
work for the government.

923
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:44,438
There's a threat that exists
of catastrophic proportions.

924
01:15:45,723 --> 01:15:48,559
I think the Russians feel
my profile is too high.

925
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,735
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

926
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:54,030
They're keeping me here to try
to stop me from doing my work.

927
01:15:54,065 --> 01:15:55,566
You have to get to Wheeler.
Stop.

928
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:56,900
You have to find William Parcher. Stop.

929
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,652
He could help us.
He could help us. Stop. Stop.

930
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:00,620
He could help us...
Stop!

931
01:16:05,493 --> 01:16:07,210
I went to Wheeler.

932
01:16:07,579 --> 01:16:08,912
Good, good.

933
01:16:08,913 --> 01:16:11,047
There is no William Parcher.

934
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:14,209
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.

935
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,179
Doing what?
Breaking codes?

936
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:22,476
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up?

937
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:25,228
How could you know that?

938
01:16:25,263 --> 01:16:27,189
Sol followed you.

939
01:16:28,474 --> 01:16:30,901
He thought it was harmless.
Sol followed me?

940
01:16:40,236 --> 01:16:42,579
They've never been opened.

941
01:16:45,283 --> 01:16:47,083
It isn't real.

942
01:16:48,286 --> 01:16:51,213
There is no conspiracy, John.

943
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:56,134
There is no William Parcher.

944
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:59,262
It's in your mind.

945
01:17:01,549 --> 01:17:04,726
Do you understand, baby?

946
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:07,938
You're sick.

947
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,776
You're sick, John.

948
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:16,613
John?

949
01:17:25,323 --> 01:17:29,493
Code red. Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation Room 2.

950
01:17:29,494 --> 01:17:33,213
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation Room 2.

951
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,692
John?

952
01:17:51,849 --> 01:17:53,942
The implant is gone.

953
01:17:55,019 --> 01:17:56,903
I can't find it.

954
01:18:00,984 --> 01:18:02,617
It's gone.

955
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:37,027
You see,
the nightmare of schizophrenia

956
01:18:37,186 --> 01:18:39,821
is not knowing what's true.

957
01:18:40,732 --> 01:18:43,867
Imagine if you had
suddenly learned that

958
01:18:43,943 --> 01:18:48,530
the people and the places and the
moments most important to you

959
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:51,408
were not gone, not dead,

960
01:18:51,409 --> 01:18:55,170
but worse, had never been.

961
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:01,051
What kind of hell would that be?

962
01:19:06,424 --> 01:19:08,308
Administering insulin.

963
01:19:09,093 --> 01:19:11,311
8:42 a.m.

964
01:20:09,445 --> 01:20:11,246
How often?

965
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:16,084
Five times a week for 10 weeks.

966
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:42,485
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

967
01:20:43,062 --> 01:20:44,980
And Hansen is running
the department now.

968
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:48,324
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

969
01:20:48,818 --> 01:20:50,193
Yeah.

970
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:54,414
John won't come near the campus, though.
I think he's ashamed.

971
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:57,959
Hey, hey.

972
01:20:58,744 --> 01:21:00,378
Want this?

973
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:04,299
So, Alicia, how are you holding up?

974
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:08,011
Well, delusions have passed.

975
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:10,714
They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...

976
01:21:10,715 --> 01:21:12,223
No...

977
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:14,809
I mean, how are you?

978
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,569
I think often what I feel

979
01:21:25,062 --> 01:21:26,988
is obligation.

980
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,368
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

981
01:21:34,071 --> 01:21:38,374
Rage against John, against God, and...

982
01:21:40,578 --> 01:21:41,920
But...

983
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:47,300
Then I look at him,

984
01:21:48,085 --> 01:21:52,388
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

985
01:21:53,382 --> 01:21:55,425
And he becomes that man.

986
01:21:55,426 --> 01:21:59,771
He's transformed into
someone that I love.

987
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:06,444
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.

988
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:11,616
It's not all the time, but

989
01:22:13,486 --> 01:22:15,370
it's enough.

990
01:22:16,072 --> 01:22:19,916
I think John is
a very lucky man, Alicia.

991
01:22:24,997 --> 01:22:26,673
So unlucky.

992
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:31,962
This is us.
This is it?

993
01:22:31,963 --> 01:22:33,213
It's nice.

994
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:34,597
It's near where I work.

995
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,141
John? You have a visitor.

996
01:22:40,638 --> 01:22:44,023
Hi.

997
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,276
I hope it's okay.

998
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:55,243
Hey, chief.

999
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,905
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

1000
01:22:58,906 --> 01:23:00,874
I quit, actually.

1001
01:23:05,121 --> 01:23:06,963
Hello.
Hey, John.

1002
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,426
Have you met Harvey?

1003
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:16,006
John, there's no...
Relax, it's okay.

1004
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:18,675
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

1005
01:23:18,676 --> 01:23:21,936
Jesus Christ, John.
You know, I should have known.

1006
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:25,023
Here you go.

1007
01:23:27,351 --> 01:23:29,185
I can take those later.

1008
01:23:29,186 --> 01:23:31,029
You're supposed to take them now.

1009
01:23:32,189 --> 01:23:33,781
Can I bring you something?

1010
01:23:33,816 --> 01:23:35,491
I'm okay.

1011
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:36,993
Okay.

1012
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:44,534
So, yeah, I was in
town giving a workshop.

1013
01:23:44,535 --> 01:23:46,502
I go back tonight.

1014
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:50,924
You know, Bender,
he really wanted to stop by

1015
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:53,543
and, you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

1016
01:23:53,544 --> 01:23:55,053
Squeamish?

1017
01:23:56,714 --> 01:23:58,089
Yeah.

1018
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,383
I suppose I would be, too.

1019
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,019
But, alas, I'm stuck with me.

1020
01:24:05,931 --> 01:24:08,558
I'm trying to solve
the Riemann hypothesis.

1021
01:24:08,559 --> 01:24:09,859
Uh-huh.

1022
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:12,445
Yeah?

1023
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:16,066
I figured if I dazzle them

1024
01:24:16,067 --> 01:24:18,910
they will have to reinstate me.

1025
01:24:19,904 --> 01:24:23,156
But it's difficult with the medication

1026
01:24:23,157 --> 01:24:27,085
because it's hard to

1027
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:31,339
see the solution.

1028
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:42,141
You know, John, you should go easy.

1029
01:24:42,301 --> 01:24:46,062
There are other things besides work.

1030
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,900
What are they?

1031
01:25:26,512 --> 01:25:29,147
What are you thinking about?

1032
01:25:32,309 --> 01:25:34,102
What do people do?

1033
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:35,987
It's life, John.

1034
01:25:36,313 --> 01:25:38,489
Activities available.

1035
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:41,159
Just add meaning.

1036
01:25:48,451 --> 01:25:51,085
You could try leaving the house.

1037
01:25:51,704 --> 01:25:55,715
You know, maybe talk to people.

1038
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:04,140
You could try taking out the garbage.

1039
01:26:25,488 --> 01:26:29,165
And there's some more...
There's some more in...

1040
01:26:40,544 --> 01:26:43,554
Who...
Who were you talking to?

1041
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:45,723
Garbage man.

1042
01:26:54,558 --> 01:26:57,193
Garbage men don't come at night.

1043
01:26:59,897 --> 01:27:02,365
I guess around here they do.

1044
01:27:28,259 --> 01:27:29,892
Sorry.

1045
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,502
Is it the medication?

1046
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:21,671
I don't know what to do.

1047
01:29:39,515 --> 01:29:42,650
My mother's going to keep the
baby a little longer tonight.

1048
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:46,362
I can get three hours of overtime.

1049
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:13,931
I'm going to bed.

1050
01:30:20,889 --> 01:30:23,274
Good night.

1051
01:31:42,137 --> 01:31:44,522
It's good to see you, John.

1052
01:31:45,349 --> 01:31:47,400
It's been a while.

1053
01:31:48,227 --> 01:31:49,652
Parcher?

1054
01:31:50,354 --> 01:31:51,904
Yes, sir.

1055
01:31:55,192 --> 01:31:56,526
You're not real!

1056
01:31:56,527 --> 01:31:59,495
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

1057
01:32:03,826 --> 01:32:06,585
I don't think that
I would go that way, John.

1058
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:10,381
It's time for you to get back to work.

1059
01:32:10,582 --> 01:32:14,510
The bomb is in its final
position here in the U.S.

1060
01:32:16,255 --> 01:32:17,839
Knowing your situation requires

1061
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,975
you keep a low profile, Mohammed,

1062
01:32:21,844 --> 01:32:24,395
we've brought the mountain to you.

1063
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,949
We've narrowed the bomb's location

1064
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:48,127
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard,

1065
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:51,964
but we haven't been able to
pinpoint its exact position.

1066
01:32:54,585 --> 01:32:58,137
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1067
01:33:00,382 --> 01:33:02,391
Look at this, John.

1068
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,855
What? What?

1069
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,434
Dr. Rosen said...

1070
01:33:11,435 --> 01:33:14,187
Rosen! That quack!

1071
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:17,740
"Schizophrenic break from reality," right?
Psychological bullshit!

1072
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:20,576
Look at me, John.

1073
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:22,912
John, look at me.

1074
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:26,707
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1075
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:30,953
Wheeler has no record of you.

1076
01:33:30,954 --> 01:33:33,672
Do you think we list our personnel?

1077
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:38,844
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1078
01:33:39,546 --> 01:33:42,473
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1079
01:33:42,591 --> 01:33:45,301
I can restore your status at Wheeler.

1080
01:33:45,302 --> 01:33:48,137
I can let the world know what you did.

1081
01:33:48,138 --> 01:33:50,606
But I need you now, soldier.

1082
01:33:56,647 --> 01:33:59,365
I was so scared you weren't real.

1083
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:08,991
There's a storm coming.

1084
01:34:08,992 --> 01:34:11,827
I'm just going to
grab the laundry. Okay?

1085
01:34:11,828 --> 01:34:13,837
I'll draw his bath.

1086
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,634
It's okay.

1087
01:34:20,462 --> 01:34:21,845
Okay.

1088
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:01,570
John!

1089
01:36:07,944 --> 01:36:11,372
I've almost got it!
Charles, you just watch the baby.

1090
01:36:12,157 --> 01:36:13,499
No!

1091
01:36:14,534 --> 01:36:15,959
Oh, God.

1092
01:36:24,836 --> 01:36:26,962
Charles was watching him.
He was okay.

1093
01:36:26,963 --> 01:36:28,514
There is no one here.

1094
01:36:28,632 --> 01:36:29,799
Oh, my God!

1095
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,550
Charles was watching him.
There is no one here!

1096
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:33,552
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1097
01:36:33,553 --> 01:36:35,471
I can see him because of a chemical

1098
01:36:35,472 --> 01:36:37,306
that was released into my bloodstream

1099
01:36:37,307 --> 01:36:39,149
when my implant dissolved.

1100
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:43,487
I couldn't tell you, it was
for your own protection!

1101
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,949
Alicia!

1102
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:52,905
No!

1103
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,990
Hello, I need
Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1104
01:36:54,991 --> 01:36:56,625
You've got to stop her, John.

1105
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,838
You leave her out of it.

1106
01:37:02,499 --> 01:37:03,916
Who are you talking to?

1107
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:05,835
It's not her fault.
John.

1108
01:37:05,836 --> 01:37:08,170
She'll compromise us again.
No, she won't.

1109
01:37:08,171 --> 01:37:09,338
You'll go back to the hospital.

1110
01:37:09,339 --> 01:37:10,714
John, answer me!

1111
01:37:10,715 --> 01:37:12,049
Countless people will die.

1112
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:13,926
Alicia, please put the phone down.

1113
01:37:13,927 --> 01:37:15,094
I can't let that happen.

1114
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:18,480
Yes, hello? Hi, I need Dr.
Rosen. Is he in?

1115
01:37:19,724 --> 01:37:21,650
I'm sorry, John.

1116
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:24,111
No!

1117
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:28,524
Alicia.

1118
01:37:28,525 --> 01:37:29,692
You know what you have to do, Nash.

1119
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:30,818
Get away from me.

1120
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:33,078
She's too great a risk.
Get away!

1121
01:37:34,197 --> 01:37:35,998
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1122
01:37:38,034 --> 01:37:40,502
Finish her.
She knows too much now.

1123
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:46,167
Uncle John?

1124
01:37:46,168 --> 01:37:49,712
You take care of her, you pathetic piece
of shit, or I'll take care of you.

1125
01:37:49,713 --> 01:37:53,883
John. Christ, John,
please do what he says.

1126
01:37:53,884 --> 01:37:56,393
Move, soldier.

1127
01:37:56,553 --> 01:37:57,895
Now.

1128
01:37:57,929 --> 01:37:59,480
Uncle John?

1129
01:38:00,098 --> 01:38:01,940
John, please!

1130
01:38:03,059 --> 01:38:04,401
Now!

1131
01:38:04,895 --> 01:38:07,438
Alicia and Charles never coexist
in the same interactive field.

1132
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,157
Parcher and Charles...

1133
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:16,038
Charles and Marcee
cannot coexist with Alicia.

1134
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:20,993
With Alicia.

1135
01:38:20,994 --> 01:38:23,003
I understand.

1136
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:29,134
No!

1137
01:38:39,471 --> 01:38:41,021
She never gets old.

1138
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:47,486
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1139
01:39:20,637 --> 01:39:22,145
You see them now?

1140
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:32,948
Yes.

1141
01:39:35,110 --> 01:39:36,827
Why did you stop your meds?

1142
01:39:40,031 --> 01:39:41,498
Because I couldn't do my work.

1143
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,168
I couldn't help with
the baby. I couldn't...

1144
01:39:47,622 --> 01:39:49,214
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1145
01:39:52,752 --> 01:39:54,553
You think that's better
than being crazy?

1146
01:39:55,005 --> 01:39:57,339
We'll need to start
you on a higher run

1147
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,383
of insulin shocks
and a new medication.

1148
01:39:59,384 --> 01:40:00,726
No.

1149
01:40:01,761 --> 01:40:03,345
There has to be another way.

1150
01:40:03,346 --> 01:40:05,314
Schizophrenia is degenerative.

1151
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:09,476
Some days may be symptom-free, but
over time, you are getting worse.

1152
01:40:09,477 --> 01:40:12,362
It's a problem.
That's all it is.

1153
01:40:13,356 --> 01:40:15,190
It's a problem with no solution.

1154
01:40:15,191 --> 01:40:17,026
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

1155
01:40:17,027 --> 01:40:18,902
That's what I do best.
This isn't math.

1156
01:40:18,903 --> 01:40:20,321
You can't come up with a formula to

1157
01:40:20,322 --> 01:40:22,031
change the way
you experience the world.

1158
01:40:22,032 --> 01:40:23,741
All I have to do is apply my mind.

1159
01:40:23,742 --> 01:40:25,534
There's no theorem, no proof.

1160
01:40:25,535 --> 01:40:26,869
You can't reason your way out of this.

1161
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:28,037
Why not? Why can't I?

1162
01:40:28,038 --> 01:40:31,506
Because your mind is where the
problem is in the first place.

1163
01:40:33,335 --> 01:40:35,135
I can do this.

1164
01:40:36,087 --> 01:40:39,389
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

1165
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:44,436
Is that the baby?

1166
01:40:46,264 --> 01:40:48,565
The baby is at my mother's, John.

1167
01:41:02,572 --> 01:41:09,419
Without treatment, John, the
fantasies may take over entirely.

1168
01:41:27,931 --> 01:41:29,523
You almost ready?

1169
01:41:32,102 --> 01:41:33,986
Rosen's waiting outside.

1170
01:41:35,438 --> 01:41:37,489
I can't go back to that hospital.

1171
01:41:41,444 --> 01:41:42,995
I won't come home.

1172
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:52,838
He said that if you said that he has
commitment papers for me to sign.

1173
01:41:55,834 --> 01:41:58,010
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1174
01:41:59,295 --> 01:42:01,346
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1175
01:42:04,592 --> 01:42:06,601
I will try to figure this out.

1176
01:42:08,805 --> 01:42:13,483
Whatever you do, Rosen is
right about one thing.

1177
01:42:14,811 --> 01:42:16,445
You shouldn't be here.

1178
01:42:19,065 --> 01:42:20,532
I'm not safe anymore.

1179
01:42:26,614 --> 01:42:28,623
Would you have hurt me, John?

1180
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:39,843
I don't know.

1181
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:43,472
Maybe you should let Dr.
Rosen drive you to your mother's.

1182
01:43:04,694 --> 01:43:06,369
He told me to leave.

1183
01:43:13,536 --> 01:43:15,170
I understand.

1184
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:53,792
Rosen said to call if you try
and kill me, or anything.

1185
01:44:11,094 --> 01:44:13,103
You want to know what's real?

1186
01:44:18,017 --> 01:44:19,617
This.

1187
01:44:38,246 --> 01:44:40,005
This is real.

1188
01:44:43,293 --> 01:44:47,804
Maybe the part that knows
the waking from the dream,

1189
01:44:49,424 --> 01:44:51,099
maybe it isn't here.

1190
01:44:55,096 --> 01:44:56,771
Maybe it's here.

1191
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:08,116
I need to believe that something
extraordinary is possible.

1192
01:46:11,214 --> 01:46:12,597
Come.

1193
01:46:21,683 --> 01:46:22,983
Hello, Martin.

1194
01:46:28,398 --> 01:46:30,156
Jesus Christ.

1195
01:46:31,734 --> 01:46:33,326
No, I...

1196
01:46:34,654 --> 01:46:38,581
I don't have that one. My savior complex
takes on a completely different form.

1197
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:43,620
I heard what happened
and I wanted to write,

1198
01:46:43,621 --> 01:46:44,913
and I tried you at MacArthur's,

1199
01:46:44,914 --> 01:46:46,756
but you'd left, and I just...

1200
01:46:59,887 --> 01:47:01,604
This is Helinger's old office.

1201
01:47:02,056 --> 01:47:03,440
Yeah.

1202
01:47:03,558 --> 01:47:05,692
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1203
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:10,989
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1204
01:47:12,692 --> 01:47:14,951
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

1205
01:47:15,611 --> 01:47:17,704
Please, please, have a seat.

1206
01:47:18,906 --> 01:47:20,623
God, it's so good to see you.

1207
01:47:23,619 --> 01:47:25,670
What brings you back to Princeton?

1208
01:47:25,913 --> 01:47:30,083
John? John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

1209
01:47:30,084 --> 01:47:32,461
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1210
01:47:32,462 --> 01:47:35,513
Tell him your work is
critical. John, please!

1211
01:47:50,354 --> 01:47:53,406
Is there any chance that you
could ignore what I just did?

1212
01:47:55,109 --> 01:47:57,285
Of course.
What are old friends for?

1213
01:47:59,447 --> 01:48:02,074
Is that what
we are, Martin? Friends?

1214
01:48:02,075 --> 01:48:03,666
John, of course.

1215
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,920
Of course.
We always have been.

1216
01:48:12,126 --> 01:48:17,389
Alicia and I think that fitting
in, being part of a community,

1217
01:48:20,968 --> 01:48:22,344
might do me some good.

1218
01:48:22,345 --> 01:48:24,012
That a certain level of attachment,

1219
01:48:24,013 --> 01:48:25,897
familiar places, familiar people,

1220
01:48:27,517 --> 01:48:31,152
might help me elbow out

1221
01:48:35,483 --> 01:48:37,784
these certain delusions that I have.

1222
01:48:43,324 --> 01:48:45,625
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1223
01:48:48,037 --> 01:48:50,088
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

1224
01:48:53,543 --> 01:48:56,094
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1225
01:49:05,221 --> 01:49:06,646
Huh.

1226
01:49:10,601 --> 01:49:12,360
Will you be needing an office?

1227
01:49:16,941 --> 01:49:18,283
No.

1228
01:49:21,445 --> 01:49:23,538
No, I could just
work out of the library.

1229
01:49:24,365 --> 01:49:27,033
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

1230
01:49:27,034 --> 01:49:28,410
but he doesn't have ID.

1231
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:29,744
Why can't people
read their memos, huh?

1232
01:49:29,745 --> 01:49:31,629
Then, he goes totally nuts.

1233
01:49:31,747 --> 01:49:34,966
You're not real!
You're not real.

1234
01:49:35,418 --> 01:49:36,918
There's no mission.

1235
01:49:36,919 --> 01:49:39,137
Shit. Shit.

1236
01:49:39,964 --> 01:49:42,424
You're not real!
You are not real!

1237
01:49:42,425 --> 01:49:45,594
Is this what you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?

1238
01:49:45,595 --> 01:49:47,554
The local madman?

1239
01:49:47,555 --> 01:49:48,930
I'm not a soldier.

1240
01:49:48,931 --> 01:49:50,265
You're gonna end up in a cell!

1241
01:49:50,266 --> 01:49:52,475
Old, worthless, discarded.

1242
01:49:52,476 --> 01:49:53,685
There's no mission.

1243
01:49:53,686 --> 01:49:57,105
And while you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!

1244
01:49:57,106 --> 01:49:59,566
You are not real!
You are not real!

1245
01:49:59,567 --> 01:50:01,776
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1246
01:50:01,777 --> 01:50:04,946
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1247
01:50:04,947 --> 01:50:07,207
John! John!

1248
01:50:08,409 --> 01:50:12,120
Hey, hey, hey.
John, John. It's okay.

1249
01:50:12,121 --> 01:50:13,872
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John.

1250
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:15,924
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

1251
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:18,676
Nash, hey, you're all right.

1252
01:50:21,422 --> 01:50:22,805
Nash.

1253
01:50:27,303 --> 01:50:30,263
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1254
01:50:30,264 --> 01:50:31,648
John?

1255
01:50:33,976 --> 01:50:36,228
You should've seen their faces.

1256
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:38,696
Everybody was just staring at me.

1257
01:50:38,898 --> 01:50:43,826
John, you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1258
01:50:44,403 --> 01:50:45,912
I know.

1259
01:50:48,824 --> 01:50:52,627
But then, on the way home,
Charles was there.

1260
01:50:57,667 --> 01:51:00,051
Sometimes, I really
miss talking to him.

1261
01:51:03,798 --> 01:51:05,306
Maybe Rosen's right.

1262
01:51:06,842 --> 01:51:09,852
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1263
01:51:10,221 --> 01:51:12,689
No. Come here.

1264
01:51:17,395 --> 01:51:19,487
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1265
01:51:44,213 --> 01:51:47,390
John, now you can't ignore me forever.

1266
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:56,899
Charles, you've been a very
good friend to me. The best.

1267
01:51:59,103 --> 01:52:00,862
But I won't talk to you again.

1268
01:52:04,734 --> 01:52:06,534
I just can't.

1269
01:52:12,575 --> 01:52:14,459
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1270
01:52:22,418 --> 01:52:24,418
Good-bye.

1271
01:52:47,401 --> 01:52:49,619
I was wondering if
I might audit your course.

1272
01:52:51,447 --> 01:52:54,207
It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1273
01:52:57,411 --> 01:52:58,920
Is something wrong?

1274
01:53:00,956 --> 01:53:02,507
This will be my first class.

1275
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:10,431
Good morning, eager young minds.

1276
01:53:30,986 --> 01:53:32,995
It's never going to work, John.

1277
01:53:33,322 --> 01:53:36,082
You're just humiliating yourself.

1278
01:53:38,452 --> 01:53:42,380
It's pathetic!
You are being pathetic.

1279
01:53:42,957 --> 01:53:44,716
I'm ashamed of you!

1280
01:54:12,194 --> 01:54:13,745
Man!

1281
01:54:17,825 --> 01:54:20,668
Are you coming?
You're going to be late.

1282
01:54:23,622 --> 01:54:25,715
Dad, you've got my book.
What?

1283
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:27,709
You've got my book.

1284
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:29,343
Right.

1285
01:54:29,462 --> 01:54:30,970
Thanks.

1286
01:54:32,214 --> 01:54:33,548
Good-bye.
Bye.

1287
01:54:33,549 --> 01:54:35,016
See you tonight.

1288
01:54:36,093 --> 01:54:37,810
Bye, honey.

1289
01:56:10,396 --> 01:56:11,854
Did you just solve Riemann?

1290
01:56:11,855 --> 01:56:13,573
Well, what do you think?

1291
01:56:14,316 --> 01:56:15,441
Huh.

1292
01:56:15,442 --> 01:56:18,703
That's an analog to Frobenius
for non-commutative extensions.

1293
01:56:20,781 --> 01:56:22,456
Yes, it is.

1294
01:56:23,075 --> 01:56:26,168
But it only appears to
work sporadically, so, no.

1295
01:56:27,871 --> 01:56:30,131
But I believe I'm making progress.

1296
01:56:31,709 --> 01:56:36,137
You're John Nash, right?

1297
01:56:39,049 --> 01:56:41,050
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

1298
01:56:41,051 --> 01:56:42,844
I've been studying your equilibrium,

1299
01:56:42,845 --> 01:56:44,554
the one you wrote here at Princeton.

1300
01:56:44,555 --> 01:56:47,140
To come up with something totally
original, the way you did.

1301
01:56:47,141 --> 01:56:49,108
You know, I was young.

1302
01:56:50,686 --> 01:56:53,487
I've been developing a theory.

1303
01:57:07,745 --> 01:57:12,206
I believe I can prove that Galois
extensions are covering spaces.

1304
01:57:12,207 --> 01:57:14,417
That everything,
everything is connected.

1305
01:57:14,418 --> 01:57:17,136
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1306
01:57:18,255 --> 01:57:20,181
When was the last time you ate?

1307
01:57:20,549 --> 01:57:21,883
Excuse me?

1308
01:57:21,884 --> 01:57:23,476
You know, food.

1309
01:57:24,011 --> 01:57:25,094
Oh... Uh...

1310
01:57:25,095 --> 01:57:28,689
My wife, she loves mayonnaise.

1311
01:57:31,393 --> 01:57:33,027
Thank you.

1312
01:57:34,730 --> 01:57:36,197
Go on.

1313
01:57:36,732 --> 01:57:40,109
The function is in the two categories.

1314
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:41,702
Mmm-hmm.

1315
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:46,540
Alicia!

1316
01:57:48,035 --> 01:57:49,410
Alicia!

1317
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:51,412
...and meet together
at a maximum speed

1318
01:57:51,413 --> 01:57:54,465
of, let us say, 10 miles per hour.

1319
01:57:54,958 --> 01:57:57,551
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle "B,"

1320
01:57:58,003 --> 01:58:01,130
and the fly, who can travel
at 20 miles an hour,

1321
01:58:01,131 --> 01:58:04,384
leaves the tire of bicycle "B" and
flies to the tire of bicycle "A,"

1322
01:58:04,385 --> 01:58:07,929
and backwards and forwards, and so on and
so forth, until the two bikes collide

1323
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:10,306
and the poor little fly is squashed.

1324
01:58:10,307 --> 01:58:14,435
This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending

1325
01:58:14,436 --> 01:58:17,438
the area that you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific,

1326
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:20,942
and it is an art form, no matter what
these people around here will tell you,

1327
01:58:20,943 --> 01:58:22,527
especially the people from Biology.

1328
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:24,328
Don't listen to any of those people.

1329
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:26,197
Let me go back to
what you were doing before

1330
01:58:26,198 --> 01:58:27,573
because I think I
might want to steal this

1331
01:58:27,574 --> 01:58:29,125
and write a book and get famous.

1332
01:58:31,078 --> 01:58:33,004
I was thinking that I might teach.

1333
01:58:35,165 --> 01:58:38,300
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1334
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,014
John, besides,
you're a terrible teacher.

1335
01:58:44,216 --> 01:58:45,891
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1336
01:58:47,136 --> 01:58:50,104
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1337
01:58:50,806 --> 01:58:52,273
What about the...

1338
01:58:52,891 --> 01:58:56,027
Well, you know.
Are they gone?

1339
01:59:02,943 --> 01:59:05,036
No, they're not gone.

1340
01:59:05,738 --> 01:59:07,405
And maybe they never will be.

1341
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:08,489
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,

1342
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:11,709
and I think, as a result,
they've given up on me.

1343
01:59:13,328 --> 01:59:15,329
You think that's what it's like with

1344
01:59:15,330 --> 01:59:17,965
all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

1345
01:59:18,834 --> 01:59:21,510
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1346
01:59:21,837 --> 01:59:24,221
John, they haunt you though.

1347
01:59:25,758 --> 01:59:29,143
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.

1348
01:59:33,015 --> 01:59:34,807
Well, good-bye.

1349
01:59:34,808 --> 01:59:36,609
John, I'll talk to the department.

1350
01:59:39,021 --> 01:59:40,654
Maybe in the spring.

1351
01:59:46,779 --> 01:59:48,412
Hey, Nash.

1352
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:54,210
You scared?

1353
01:59:56,955 --> 02:00:01,209
Terrified.
Mortified. Petrified.

1354
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:03,010
Stupefied by you.

1355
02:00:03,754 --> 02:00:06,422
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you're gonna get me...

1356
02:00:06,423 --> 02:00:08,390
I'll ring her. ...
in an awful lot of trouble.

1357
02:00:12,638 --> 02:00:14,430
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

1358
02:00:14,431 --> 02:00:16,565
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

1359
02:00:17,351 --> 02:00:19,485
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
Monday, sir.

1360
02:00:19,561 --> 02:00:21,403
Professor Nash?

1361
02:00:24,525 --> 02:00:25,950
Can you see him?

1362
02:00:26,485 --> 02:00:28,369
Yeah.
You sure?

1363
02:00:28,737 --> 02:00:32,414
Positive? He's within
your vision? Good.

1364
02:00:33,283 --> 02:00:35,910
Forgive me, I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

1365
02:00:35,911 --> 02:00:37,795
See you next week, Professor.
See you next week.

1366
02:00:39,373 --> 02:00:41,290
So now that I know that you're real,

1367
02:00:41,291 --> 02:00:43,384
who are you,
and what can I do for you?

1368
02:00:44,586 --> 02:00:47,088
Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1369
02:00:47,089 --> 02:00:48,297
Thomas King?
Mmm-hmm.

1370
02:00:48,298 --> 02:00:52,685
And I'm here to tell you that you're
being considered for the Nobel Prize.

1371
02:01:01,019 --> 02:01:03,020
Forgive me, but I'm
just a little stunned.

1372
02:01:03,021 --> 02:01:06,858
Over the past few years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone

1373
02:01:06,859 --> 02:01:08,492
of modern economics.

1374
02:01:08,694 --> 02:01:10,528
Suddenly, everybody likes that one.

1375
02:01:10,529 --> 02:01:15,283
What about my work on other some such
projects, like manifold embedding?

1376
02:01:15,284 --> 02:01:19,078
The application of
your bargaining problem

1377
02:01:19,079 --> 02:01:22,999
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1378
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,584
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

1379
02:01:24,585 --> 02:01:26,711
I never would have considered that.

1380
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:31,841
Have I just reached some level of
honesty that borders on stupidity?

1381
02:01:31,842 --> 02:01:33,801
No, you haven't.

1382
02:01:33,802 --> 02:01:35,978
Because I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1383
02:01:40,893 --> 02:01:42,443
Shall we have tea?

1384
02:01:44,688 --> 02:01:48,866
I don't go in there. I usually just
take my sandwich in the library.

1385
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:52,786
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1386
02:01:53,530 --> 02:01:57,074
Most commercially
available brands of tea

1387
02:01:57,075 --> 02:01:59,285
are not suitable to
my palate, you see.

1388
02:01:59,286 --> 02:02:00,786
I'm not...

1389
02:02:00,787 --> 02:02:04,165
There are some Northern Indian
teas which are dense enough.

1390
02:02:04,166 --> 02:02:06,250
I enjoy the flavor that they have.

1391
02:02:06,251 --> 02:02:09,295
I have not been in this room
for quite some many years.

1392
02:02:09,296 --> 02:02:11,555
I wonder what tea they serve.

1393
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:15,601
Why, thank you, young lady.

1394
02:02:17,137 --> 02:02:21,273
Things have certainly changed around here.
I have a son that age.

1395
02:02:22,726 --> 02:02:24,235
Harvard.

1396
02:02:28,857 --> 02:02:29,941
Hmm.

1397
02:02:29,942 --> 02:02:32,193
I would have thought

1398
02:02:32,194 --> 02:02:35,246
the nominations for the Nobel
Prize would've been secret.

1399
02:02:35,822 --> 02:02:38,707
I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.

1400
02:02:39,326 --> 02:02:40,868
That is generally the case, yes,

1401
02:02:40,869 --> 02:02:43,087
but these are special circumstances.

1402
02:02:44,873 --> 02:02:46,840
The awards are substantial.

1403
02:02:47,417 --> 02:02:50,719
They require private funding.
As such,

1404
02:02:51,588 --> 02:02:54,014
the image of the Nobel is...

1405
02:02:56,218 --> 02:02:59,395
Oh, I see. So, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1406
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:04,650
Find out if I would screw
everything up if I actually won?

1407
02:03:05,978 --> 02:03:09,271
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1408
02:03:09,272 --> 02:03:10,731
things of this nature?

1409
02:03:10,732 --> 02:03:12,825
Something like that, yes.

1410
02:03:14,194 --> 02:03:15,828
Would I embarrass you?

1411
02:03:20,075 --> 02:03:21,709
Yes, it is possible.

1412
02:03:24,913 --> 02:03:29,675
You see, I am crazy.

1413
02:03:31,878 --> 02:03:33,929
I take the newer medications,

1414
02:03:37,718 --> 02:03:40,185
but I still see things
that are not here.

1415
02:03:42,806 --> 02:03:44,732
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1416
02:03:47,269 --> 02:03:51,739
Like a diet of the mind, I choose
not to indulge certain appetites.

1417
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:56,368
Like my appetite for patterns.

1418
02:03:58,238 --> 02:04:01,749
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1419
02:04:02,909 --> 02:04:04,585
Professor Nash.

1420
02:04:09,458 --> 02:04:11,884
It's good to have you here, John.

1421
02:04:12,836 --> 02:04:14,470
Thank you.

1422
02:04:18,884 --> 02:04:20,809
It's an honor, sir.

1423
02:04:21,344 --> 02:04:22,770
Thank you very much.

1424
02:04:23,346 --> 02:04:24,938
A privilege, Professor.

1425
02:04:29,478 --> 02:04:31,111
Professor.

1426
02:04:36,109 --> 02:04:37,526
Nicely done, John.

1427
02:04:37,527 --> 02:04:39,161
Thank you, Tom.

1428
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:44,917
Thank you.

1429
02:04:53,168 --> 02:04:54,968
Thank you, Ed.

1430
02:05:03,178 --> 02:05:05,562
That was certainly most unexpected.

1431
02:05:27,410 --> 02:05:29,044
Thank you.

1432
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:35,175
I've always believed in numbers,

1433
02:05:36,586 --> 02:05:39,847
in the equations and logics
that lead to reason.

1434
02:05:40,966 --> 02:05:47,855
But after a lifetime of such pursuits,
I ask, what truly is logic?

1435
02:05:49,266 --> 02:05:50,983
Who decides reason?

1436
02:05:52,811 --> 02:05:58,031
My quest has taken me through
the physical, the metaphysical,

1437
02:06:00,026 --> 02:06:04,413
the delusional and back.

1438
02:06:06,575 --> 02:06:09,543
And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.

1439
02:06:12,122 --> 02:06:14,381
The most important
discovery of my life.

1440
02:06:17,919 --> 02:06:20,554
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love

1441
02:06:21,548 --> 02:06:24,183
that any logical reasons can be found.

1442
02:06:27,888 --> 02:06:30,522
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1443
02:06:32,267 --> 02:06:34,151
You are the reason I am.

1444
02:06:39,316 --> 02:06:41,116
You are all my reasons.

1445
02:06:45,822 --> 02:06:47,456
Thank you.

1446
02:07:41,670 --> 02:07:43,303
So nice to have met you.

1447
02:07:46,383 --> 02:07:48,008
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1448
02:07:48,009 --> 02:07:49,601
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1449
02:07:51,763 --> 02:07:53,180
Are you ready to go now?

1450
02:07:53,181 --> 02:07:54,556
Yes, I am.

1451
02:07:54,557 --> 02:07:56,608
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1452
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,735
Thank you so much.

1453
02:07:59,771 --> 02:08:01,405
Thank you.

1454
02:08:04,109 --> 02:08:06,326
What is it?
What's wrong?

1455
02:08:10,448 --> 02:08:11,999
Nothing.

1456
02:08:13,034 --> 02:08:14,334
Nothing at all.

1457
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:18,380
Come with me, young lady.

1458
02:08:19,958 --> 02:08:24,386
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?

1459
02:08:25,213 --> 02:08:27,180
Where's it going to?

9999
