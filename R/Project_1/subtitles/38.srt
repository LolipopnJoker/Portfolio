1
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,457
Everybody, heads up!
Heads up! Keep clear!

2
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:31,662
Keep it clear!
Okay, down!

3
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:35,538
Andale, si! Vamonos.

4
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:39,049
Keep it goin'!
Come on!

5
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:45,256
That's good, stay!
Slow it down.

6
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,879
No lo vayan a tirar!
Cuidado!

7
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:52,010
Traigala, traigala!

8
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:57,927
Okay, pushing team,
move in there. Move it!

9
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:01,413
Cuidado, vamos! I want
tasers on full charge.

10
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:03,941
Aaah!

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,934
Come on,
step back in.

12
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:08,453
Move it! Adelante! Puje, puje!

13
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:11,439
And push!

14
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,811
We're locked.
Loading team, step away.

15
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:22,282
Gate keeper!

16
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:30,982
Jophery,
raise the gate.

17
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,677
Aaah!

18
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:46,883
Aaah!

19
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:50,377
Block the opening!
Don't let her get out!

20
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,352
Aaah!

21
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,615
Aaah!

22
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:02,403
Work her back!

23
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,796
Aaah!

24
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:15,836
Shoot her!

25
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,527
Shoot her!
Aaah!

26
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,441
Apuesto mil pesos
que se cae.

27
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:50,015
Hola, Juanito. Hola. Bienvenido.

28
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,249
What's this I hear
at the airport?

29
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,653
Hammond's not even here?
He sends his apologies.

30
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:57,371
We are facing a $20-million lawsuit
by the family of that worker,

31
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,287
and you're telling me that Hammond
can't even be bothered to see me?

32
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,871
He wants to be with his
daughter. She's getting a divorce.

33
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:06,303
I understand that, but we've been
advised to deal with the situation now.

34
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,360
The insurance company
- Okay?

35
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,113
The underwriters feel that
the accident has raised...

36
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,515
some very serious safety
questions about the park.

37
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,915
That makes the investors
very, very anxious.

38
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:21,820
I had to promise to conduct a
very thorough on-site inspection.

39
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:25,047
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

40
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:27,514
Juanito, they'll pull
the funding. Jefe, jefe!

41
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:29,783
That'll slow him down more.
Encontramos otros mosquitos.

42
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,120
Seguro? A ver, muestrame. Si, venga.

43
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,310
Ooh! Aaah!
Watch your head.

44
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,193
If two experts
sign off on the island,

45
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,265
the insurance guys
will back off.

46
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:43,988
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

47
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:47,057
They want Alan Grant. Grant?
You'll never get him out of Montana.

48
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,136
Luz, mas luz!
Why not?

49
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:51,477
Muchachos, echenme luz!
Si.

50
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,398
Why not?

51
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,944
Because Grant's like me.

52
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,655
He's a digger.

53
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,808
Que lindo eres.

54
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:08,628
Vas a ser-

55
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:46,990
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

56
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:51,050
I hate computers. The feeling's mutual.

57
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,814
You'll get a reading from that.

58
00:06:04,976 --> 00:06:07,626
Take a look.

59
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,060
Did it work?

60
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,059
How long does this take? It
should bring an immediate return.

61
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,710
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

62
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:18,918
Bounces it back.

63
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:23,243
This new program's incredible.

64
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:26,918
A few more years'development, and
we won't even have to dig anymore.

65
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,158
Where's the fun
in that?

66
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:33,479
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer. Oh.

67
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:37,026
Postmortem contraction of
the posterior neck ligaments.

68
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:40,195
Velociraptor?
Yes, good shape too.

69
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:43,647
It's five, six feet high, I'm guessing
nine feet long. Look at the extraordinary-

70
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,793
What'd you do?
He touched it.

71
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,970
Dr. Grant's not
machine compatible.

72
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,561
Hell, they've
got it in for me.

73
00:06:50,697 --> 00:06:53,085
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrist.

74
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:56,159
It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.

75
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:59,874
No, seriously.

76
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:03,422
Well, maybe dinosaurs have more
in common with present-day birds...

77
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,079
than they do
with reptiles.

78
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,962
Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.

79
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:12,891
Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, just like a bird.

80
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,128
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey. "

81
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,912
That doesn't look
very scary.

82
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:20,954
That kid's a pistol.

83
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:24,388
More like
a six-foot turkey.

84
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:27,647
A turkey, huh?
Oh, no.

85
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,057
Here we go. Okay, try to imagine
yourself in the Cretaceous period.

86
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,188
You get your first look at this
six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

87
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:40,096
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

88
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,812
And you keep still because you
think that maybe his visual acuity...

89
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:46,207
is based on movement, like T-Rex,
and he'll lose you if you don't move.

90
00:07:46,338 --> 00:07:49,566
But no,
not Velociraptor.

91
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:53,046
You stare at him, and
he just stares right back.

92
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,072
And that's when
the attack comes.

93
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:58,299
Not from the front,
but from the side.

94
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:01,847
From the other two raptors
you didn't even know were there.

95
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:05,398
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter, you see.

96
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,250
He uses coordinated
attack patterns,

97
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:11,229
and he is
out in force today.

98
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:14,172
And he slashes at you
with this,

99
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:18,328
a six-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

100
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:21,395
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion, say.

101
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:26,769
No, no. He slashes at you
here or here.

102
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,631
Oh, Alan.

103
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:33,400
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

104
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:38,353
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

105
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,720
So you know, try to show
a little respect. Okay.

106
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:54,543
Hey, Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

107
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,851
you could have pulled
a gun on him, you know.

108
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,886
Yeah, I know.
Kids.

109
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:03,319
You want to have one of
those? I don't want that kid.

110
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:07,309
But a breed of child, Dr. Grant,
could be intriguing.

111
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,414
I mean, what's so wrong
with kids? Oh, Ellie, look.

112
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:15,283
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive. Cheap, cheap.

113
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,748
They smell.
They do not smell.

114
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,691
Give me a break! Some of
them smell. Babies smell.

115
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,999
Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!

116
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,401
Tell them to shut down!
Shut down! Cut the machine!

117
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,214
Cover it all up!
Pull it over!

118
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:38,063
Just cut it,
will ya?

119
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:40,715
Cut it out!
Shut it down!

120
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,184
What?

121
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,934
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

122
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,861
Hey, we were saving that!

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,236
For today.
I guarantee it.

124
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:08,589
Who in God's name do you
think you are? John Hammond,

125
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:12,744
and I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.

126
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,852
Mr. Hammond
- Well, I can see that my, uh,

127
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:17,541
50,000 a year
has been well spent.

128
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:19,529
Okay, who's the jerk?

129
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,824
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr.
- Sattler.

130
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,509
Aha! Ellie, this is, uh, Mr. Hammond.

131
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:28,426
I'm sorry about the dramatic
entrance, Dr. Sattler,

132
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:30,825
but we're in a wee bit of
a hurry. Did I say "jerk"?

133
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:34,185
Will you have a drink? We won't let
it get warm. Come along, sit down.

134
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:36,519
Here, let me
- I'll just get a glass or two.

135
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:38,505
No, no, no, no,
I can manage this.

136
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,544
I know my way
around the kitchen.

137
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,787
Now, I'll get
right to the point.

138
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:46,751
Um, I like ya,
both of ya.

139
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:49,473
I can tell instantly
about people.

140
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,527
It's a gift.

141
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:56,572
I own an island off
the coast of Costa Rica.

142
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:58,621
I've leased it
from the government,

143
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,403
and I've spent the last five years
setting up a kind of biological preserve.

144
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,805
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

145
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:08,196
Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.

146
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:12,068
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

147
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:15,459
And what are those? Small
versions of adults, honey.

148
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,524
And not just kids, everyone.
We're going to open next year.

149
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,732
That is, if the lawyers
don't kill me first.

150
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:22,939
I don't care for
lawyers. Do you?

151
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,174
Oh, we, uh, don't know any.
I don't really know any.

152
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,096
Well, I do,
I'm afraid.

153
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:31,610
There's a particular pebble in
my shoe, represents my investors.

154
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:36,002
Says that they insist on outside
opinions. What kind of opinions?

155
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, your kind, not to
put too fine a point on it.

156
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:40,927
I mean, let's face it.

157
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:43,479
In your particular field,
you're the top minds.

158
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:47,578
And if I could just persuade you
to sign off on the park,

159
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:49,687
you know, give it
your endorsement,

160
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,896
maybe even pen
a wee testimonial,

161
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,430
I could get back on
"shedual," uh, schedule.

162
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:58,333
Why would they care what we
think? What kind of park is this?

163
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:03,646
It's right up your alley.

164
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,076
I'll tell you what.

165
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:09,435
Why don't you come down, just
the pair of ya, for the weekend?

166
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,250
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

167
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:15,894
I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.

168
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,647
Look, I'm sorry. This
is impossible. Yeah, we-

169
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,603
We just dug up
a new skeleton.

170
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:24,539
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig.

171
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:27,514
And this is a very unusual
time. The timing is-

172
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:29,432
For a further three years.

173
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:31,352
Hmm?

174
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:33,849
Well, uh,

175
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,800
where's the plane?

176
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,672
Yeah, okay. Cheers. Cheers.

177
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:43,893
Okay.

178
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:22,098
Yo, Dodgson!

179
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:32,040
You shouldn't
use my name.

180
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:35,210
Dodgson, Dodgson!
We've got Dodgson here!

181
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,663
See? Nobody cares.
Nice hat.

182
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,071
What are you tryin' to
look like, a secret agent?

183
00:13:41,202 --> 00:13:44,202
Well?
Seven fifty.

184
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:46,508
On delivery, 50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

185
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:49,902
That's 1.5 million, if you get
all 15 species off the island.

186
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,368
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
Remember, viable embryos.

187
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,765
They're no use to us
if they don't survive.

188
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:57,514
Oh! How am I supposed
to transport them?

189
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:03,499
The bottom screws open.

190
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:05,486
That's great.
Oh, my God.

191
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:07,621
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

192
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:11,500
Oh, that's great! Customs can
even check it if they want to.

193
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,539
Let me see. Oh! Go on.

194
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:16,492
There's enough coolant inside
for 36 hours. No menthol?

195
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:19,076
The embryos have to be back
here in San Jose by then.

196
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:21,100
That's up to your guy
on the boat.

197
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:24,098
7:00 tomorrow night on the east
dock. Make sure he gets it right.

198
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:26,145
How are you planning
to beat security?

199
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,171
I've got
an 18-minute window.

200
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,358
Eighteen minutes, and your company
catches up on ten years of research.

201
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,791
Gracias, senor.

202
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,303
Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.

203
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:42,975
That was
Hammond's mistake.

204
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:58,720
So you two, um,
dig up dinosaurs?

205
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,974
Well-
We try to.

206
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,713
You'll have to get used
to Dr. Malcolm.

207
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:14,563
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

208
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:18,042
especially for a mathematician.
Chaotician, actually.

209
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:20,003
John doesn't
subscribe to chaos,

210
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,980
particularly what it has to say about
his science project. Codswallop, Ian.

211
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:25,661
You've never been able to sufficiently
explain your concerns about the island.

212
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:28,762
Oh,John,John. Because of the
behavior of the system in phase space?

213
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,517
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching.

214
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:33,561
Is not. I do wish you wouldn't do that.

215
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:36,512
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of chaos theory?

216
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:39,904
No. No? Non-linear equations?

217
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,920
Strange attractors?

218
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,107
Dr. Sattler, I refuse
to believe that you...

219
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,958
aren't familiar with
the concept of attraction.

220
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:55,423
Hmm! I bring scientists,
you bring a rock star.

221
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:00,252
There it is.

222
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,576
Bad wind shears.

223
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:29,976
We have to drop pretty fast,
so hold on,

224
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,823
'cause it can be just
a little thrilling.

225
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:36,151
Ya-hoo!

226
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,948
No, no, you need that piece
over here, and that piece-

227
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,394
Look, we'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

228
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:22,242
The full 50 miles of
perimeter fence are in place?

229
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:25,727
And the concrete moats, and the
motion sensor tracking systems.

230
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:29,096
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

231
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:31,169
Let's get something
straight,John.

232
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,248
This is not
a weekend excursion.

233
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:35,753
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

234
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,599
Your investors, whom I
represent, are deeply concerned.

235
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:41,576
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

236
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:44,291
I'll shut you down,
John.

237
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:47,720
In 48 hours, I'llbe
accepting your apologies.

238
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,774
All right, slow down.
Stop, stop, stop!

239
00:19:00,903 --> 00:19:02,943
This shouldn't be here.

240
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:24,418
Alan, this species of
veriforman's been extinct...

241
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,752
since the Cretaceous Period.

242
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:30,265
I mean, this thing is humongous.
What? What?

243
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,706
Look at that.

244
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:04,179
Um, it's- it's a dinosaur.
Uh-huh.

245
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,239
You did it.

246
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:12,373
You crazy son of a bitch,
you did it.

247
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:15,192
Oh, Ellie, we could just tear up
the rule book on cold-bloodedness.

248
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:17,212
It doesn't apply.
They're totally wrong.

249
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,243
This is a warm-blooded creature.
This thing doesn't live in a swamp.

250
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,249
- This thing's got what, a 27-foot
neck? - The brachiosaur, 30.

251
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:24,761
Thirty feet.

252
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,220
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

253
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:50,541
How fast are they? Well,
we clocked the T-Rex...

254
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,844
at 32 miles an hour.

255
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,373
T- T-Rex?
Mm-hmm.

256
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:59,153
You said you've
got a T-Rex? Uh-huh.

257
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:01,326
Say again.

258
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:04,495
We have a T-Rex.
Oh.

259
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,379
Put your head
between your knees.

260
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:10,771
Dr. Grant,
my dear Dr. Sattler,

261
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,643
welcome to Jurassic Park.

262
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,242
They're moving in herds.

263
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:42,569
They do move in herds.

264
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:51,431
How'd you do this?

265
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:56,078
I'll show you.

266
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:20,841
G'day, g'day, g'day!

267
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,746
Now, the most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

268
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,144
incorporating all
the latest technologies.

269
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:30,570
And I'm not talking just about
rides, you know. Everybody has rides.

270
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:34,822
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding...

271
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,736
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

272
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:41,246
So what are you
thinking?

273
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:45,607
That we're out of a job.
Don't you mean "extinct"?

274
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:54,310
Well, now, why don't
you all sit down?

275
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,708
Uh, Donald,
sit down, sit down.

276
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,878
Ah, here.
Here he comes.

277
00:22:59,014 --> 00:23:01,436
Well, here I come.
Yes.

278
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:06,917
Hello, hello. Say hello. Say hello.

279
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,314
Hello.
H- Hello.

280
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:13,340
Hello,John. Oh, yes, I've got lines.

281
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,608
Well, fine, fine, I guess.
But how did I get here?

282
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,260
Uh, uh, well,
let me show you.

283
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:22,592
First I'll need a drop
of blood, your blood.

284
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:24,992
Right.

285
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:27,326
Ooh! John, that hurt.

286
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:30,175
Relax, John, it's all part
of the miracle of cloning.

287
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:33,306
Hello,John.
Hello,John.

288
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:35,743
Hello.
Cloned from what?

289
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:38,174
Loy extraction has never
recreated an intact D.N.A. strand.

290
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,160
Not without
massive sequence gaps.

291
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,492
Paleo-D.N.A.
from what source?

292
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:45,112
Where do you get a
100-million-year-old dinosaur blood?

293
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:47,037
Shhh!

294
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,061
What?
What?

295
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:55,868
Oh, well, Mr. D.N.A.!
Where did you come from?

296
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,821
From your blood.

297
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,220
Just one drop of
your blood contains...

298
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,684
billions of strands of D.N.A.,
the building blocks of life.

299
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,146
A D.N.A. strand like me is a
blueprint for building a living thing.

300
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:13,204
And sometimes, animals that went
extinct millions of years ago,

301
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:17,202
like dinosaurs, left their
blueprints behind for us to find.

302
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,544
We just had to know
where to look.

303
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:24,083
100 million years ago, there
were mosquitoes, just like today.

304
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:30,067
And just like today, they fed on
the blood of animals, even dinosaurs.

305
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,177
Sometimes,
after bitin'a dinosaur,

306
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:34,834
the mosquito would land
on the branch of a tree...

307
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,879
and get stuck in the sap.

308
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,432
After a long time,
the tree sap would get hard...

309
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:43,502
and become fossilized,
just like a dinosaur bone,

310
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:46,770
preserving the mosquito inside.

311
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:51,181
This fossilized tree sap,
which we call amber,

312
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:55,792
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside.

313
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,869
Until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.

314
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:01,072
Using sophisticated techniques,

315
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,890
they extract the preserved blood
from the mosquito,

316
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:07,666
and bingo.:
dino D.N.A.

317
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:12,499
A full D.N.A. strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

318
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:16,818
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,

319
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,722
it'd take two years to look at
the entire D.N.A. strand.

320
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,640
It's that long.

321
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,000
Since it's so old,
it's full of holes.

322
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:28,552
Now that's where our
geneticists take over.

323
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:31,789
Thinkin'machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...

324
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:34,824
break down the strand
in minutes.

325
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:40,078
And virtual-reality displays show our
geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence.

326
00:25:40,209 --> 00:25:44,617
We use the complete D.N.A. of
a frog to fill in the holes...

327
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:47,205
and complete the code.

328
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:48,717
Phew!

329
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,663
And now, we can make
a baby dinosaur.

330
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:56,138
This score is only temporary.

331
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,954
It all has very dramatic music,
of course. Rum-pum-pum!

332
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:01,355
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

333
00:26:01,486 --> 00:26:04,485
And then, of course,
the tour moves on.

334
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,277
Well, lookie here!

335
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:16,745
Those hard-workin'cowpokes
you see behind the glass-

336
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,243
This is overwhelming,
John.

337
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:23,363
Are- Are these characters,
uh, auto-erotica?

338
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,183
No, no, no, we have no
animatronics here, no.

339
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:29,031
Those people are the real
miracle workers of Jurassic Park.

340
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:32,643
...D.N.A. in unfertilized
emu or ostrich eggs.

341
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:36,094
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

342
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:39,714
Can't we see the unfertilized
eggs? Shortly, shortly, shortly.

343
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:43,165
Now, a whole team of
genetic engineers-

344
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,501
Can't
- Can't you stop these things? I'm sorry, it's kind of a ride.

345
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,477
One, two, three.

346
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,844
Uh-
You can't do that.

347
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:54,146
What?
Can they do that?

348
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,953
A reminder.:

349
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:00,639
The boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 1900 hours.

350
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:06,109
All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.

351
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:09,628
G'day, Henry.
Oh, good day, sir.

352
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:24,418
Oh. It's turning the eggs.

353
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:29,472
Oh, God.
Oh, perfect timing.

354
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:31,838
I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

355
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,304
Henry, Henry, Henry,
why didn't you tell me?

356
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:38,045
I insist on being here
when they're born.

357
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:42,453
Come on, come on.

358
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:45,821
Come on, little one.

359
00:27:45,952 --> 00:27:47,927
Come on.

360
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,089
Come on, little one, come on.
Come on, then.

361
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:54,621
Come on, then.

362
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,230
Very good.
Push, push!

363
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,603
Very good!
Oh, God.

364
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:03,549
Push, come on!

365
00:28:03,678 --> 00:28:06,492
Come on, then.
Come on, then.

366
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:09,370
There you are.
There you are.

367
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,210
There.

368
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,268
They imprint on the first
creature they come in contact with.

369
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,535
That's it!
Helps them to trust me.

370
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,252
I've been present
for the birth...

371
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,589
of every little creature
on this island.

372
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:29,016
Well, surely not the ones
that have bred in the wilds.

373
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,959
Yes. Actually, they
can't breed in the wild.

374
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,937
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

375
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:38,480
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

376
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,951
How do you know
they can't breed?

377
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,396
Well, because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

378
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:47,667
Oh. We've engineered them that way.

379
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,766
There you are.

380
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:54,034
Oh, my God!
Look at that.

381
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:57,711
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80's maybe.

382
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,852
Wu?
Uh, 91.

383
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:03,054
Homeothermic? It holds that
temperature? Mm-hmm, yeah.

384
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,978
That's incredible.

385
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:07,984
Ooh.

386
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:11,084
But, um, again, how do you
know they're all female?

387
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:14,733
What, does somebody go out in the
park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

388
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,251
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

389
00:29:18,388 --> 00:29:20,875
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female anyway.

390
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,491
They require an extra hormone given at the
right developmental stage to make them male.

391
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,415
We simply
deny them that.

392
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,425
Deny them that?
John, the kind of control...

393
00:29:29,554 --> 00:29:32,205
you're attempting is, uh,
it's not possible.

394
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,672
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

395
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,621
it's that life
will not be contained.

396
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:39,022
Life breaks free,
it expands to new territories...

397
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:42,251
and crashes through barriers
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

398
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,897
but, uh,
well, there it is.

399
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,098
There it is.

400
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:53,387
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

401
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:58,439
No, I'm simply saying that life,
uh, finds a way.

402
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:07,368
What species is this?

403
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,152
Uh... it's a velociraptor.

404
00:30:13,132 --> 00:30:14,987
You bred raptors?

405
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:30,150
Dr. Grant, as I was saying,

406
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:33,541
we laid on lunch for you before
you set out into the park.

407
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:37,448
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro
- Oh. What are they doing?

408
00:30:39,752 --> 00:30:43,265
Feeding them.

409
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:53,344
Alejandro's, uh, prepared a delightful
menu for us: Chilean sea bass, I believe.

410
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:56,130
Uh, shall we?

411
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:35,254
They should all
be destroyed.

412
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:38,272
Robert. Robert Muldoon,
my game warden from Kenya.

413
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:41,246
Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, but
knows more about raptors than anyone.

414
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,123
What kind of metabolism do they
have? What's their growth rate?

415
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:47,005
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

416
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:49,720
I've hunted most things that can hunt
you, but the way these things move-

417
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,960
Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.

418
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:56,185
Fifty, sixty miles per hour, if they ever got
out in the open. And they're astonishing jumpers.

419
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,318
Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's why
we're taking extreme precautions.

420
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:02,323
The viewing area set down below
here... Do they show intelligence?

421
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:04,916
With their brain cavities, we assumed that
- They're extremely intelligent.

422
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:09,274
Even problem-solving intelligence;
especially the big one.

423
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:12,154
We bred eight originally,
but she took over the pride...

424
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:14,870
and killed all
but two of the others.

425
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:17,753
That one, when she
looks at you,

426
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:20,501
you can see
she's working things out.

427
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:23,253
That's why we have
to feed 'em like this.

428
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:25,808
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

429
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,313
The fences are electrified,
though, right?

430
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:31,606
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

431
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:36,309
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

432
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:40,085
They remember.

433
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,508
Yes. Well.
Who's hungry?

434
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:54,486
More adventurous guests...

435
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:57,364
can opt for ourjungle river cruise or for a
close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs-

436
00:32:57,494 --> 00:32:59,534
None of these attractions
are ready yet,

437
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:03,347
but the park will open with the
basic tour you're about to take.

438
00:33:03,477 --> 00:33:06,324
Other rides will come on-line
six or twelve months after that.

439
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,551
Absolutely spectacular designs.
Spared no expense.

440
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:14,417
And we can charge anything we want: 2,000
a day, 10,000 a day. And people will pay it.

441
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:17,646
Then there's the merchandise. I can personally advise
- Donald. Donald.

442
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,975
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

443
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:25,264
Everyone in the world has the right to
enjoy these animals. Sure. They will.

444
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:29,289
What, we'll have, uh,
a coupon day or something.

445
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:35,888
Gee, the lack of humility before
nature that's being displayed here,

446
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:38,121
um... staggers me.

447
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:41,104
Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I
think things are a little bit different...

448
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:43,271
than you and I feared.
Yeah. They're a lot worse.

449
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:46,287
Now wait a second. We haven't
even seen the park yet,

450
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:49,162
and you
- No, Donald, Donald. Donald, let him talk.

451
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:52,142
I want to hear every
viewpoint. I really do.

452
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:56,940
Yeah. Don't you see the danger, uh,John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

453
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,656
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen,

454
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,408
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

455
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,508
- It's hardly appropriate to start
hurling generalizations- - If I may.

456
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:09,092
Um, I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power that you're using here.

457
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:13,057
Uh, it didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

458
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,805
You know, you read what others had
done and you took the next step.

459
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:20,418
You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves,
so you don't take any responsibility...

460
00:34:20,587 --> 00:34:22,409
for it.

461
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:26,368
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could,

462
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:28,481
and before you even
knew what you had,

463
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:32,065
you patented it, packaged it and
slapped it on a plastic lunch box.

464
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:35,364
And now you're selling it.
You wanna sell it. Well-

465
00:34:35,497 --> 00:34:38,115
I, I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

466
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:41,412
Our scientists have done things
which nobody's ever done before.

467
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:44,293
Your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether or not they could,

468
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:47,238
they didn't stop
to think if they should.

469
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:50,182
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

470
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:52,166
No! If I was to
- No, no.

471
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,707
If I was to create a flock of condors,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

472
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:59,588
Hold on. This isn't some species that
was obliterated by deforestation...

473
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:01,789
or the building
of a dam.

474
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:04,226
Dinosaurs, uh, uh,
had their shot,

475
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:07,969
and nature selected them
for extinction.

476
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:12,475
I simply don't understand this Luddite
attitude, especially from a scientist.

477
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:17,281
I mean, how can we stand in the
light of discovery and not act?

478
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,864
Oh, what's so great about
discovery? It's a violent,

479
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:22,620
penetrative act
that scars what it explores.

480
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,121
What you call
discovery...

481
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:27,737
I call the rape
of the natural world.

482
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:29,848
Well, the question is:

483
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:32,832
How can you know anything
about an extinct ecosystem?

484
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:35,644
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

485
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:38,362
You have plants in this
building that are poisonous.

486
00:35:38,497 --> 00:35:40,438
You picked them
because they look good;

487
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:43,576
but these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in,

488
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:46,745
and they'll defend themselves,
violently, if necessary.

489
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:52,254
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here...

490
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:55,763
who could appreciate
what I'm trying to do-

491
00:35:55,966 --> 00:36:00,787
The world has just changed so radically,
and we're all running to catch up.

492
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,308
I don't want to jump to
any conclusions, but look,

493
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:09,430
dinosaurs and man, two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution,

494
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:12,793
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

495
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:17,560
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea of what to expect?

496
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:20,757
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

497
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:23,475
You're meant to defend me
against these characters,

498
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:26,773
and the only one I've got on my
side is the bloodsucking lawyer.

499
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:29,175
Thank you.

500
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:37,103
Well. They're here.

501
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:40,530
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

502
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,314
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

503
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:46,130
- Grandpa!
- Kids!

504
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:51,732
Wait! Careful with the
old man. We miss you.

505
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:54,612
Thanks for the presents. We loved
the presents. They were great.

506
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:56,661
Did you enjoy
the helicopter?

507
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:59,155
Yeah! It went down,
and we all went right up.

508
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:05,614
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

509
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:09,196
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious?

510
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:12,081
These will be your
transports for the afternoon.

511
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:14,481
No drivers.
No, no, no, no. No drivers.

512
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:17,677
They're electric. They run on this
track in the middle of the roadway.

513
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:20,593
Totally non-polluting. Top of
the line. Spared no expense.

514
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:23,089
It's an interactive
CD-ROM! Look!

515
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,479
You just touch the screen and
it talks about whatever you want.

516
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:28,616
Lex, darling, you're
all right in there.

517
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:31,151
Dr. Sattler, come with me. Dr.
Grant, come in the second car.

518
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:34,063
I'm gonna ride with,
uh, Dr. Sattler.

519
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,951
I read your book.

520
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,094
Well, that's...
that's great.

521
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:53,605
Do you really think that dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they all went?

522
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:58,182
Well, a few species may have
evolved along those lines.

523
00:38:02,637 --> 00:38:06,085
They sure don't look
like birds to me.

524
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:09,035
I heard that there's
this, um, meteor,

525
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:13,386
hit the earth someplace in
Mexico and made this big crater?

526
00:38:13,515 --> 00:38:16,482
Listen, uh-
Tim.

527
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,415
Tim, which car
were you planning on?

528
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:23,305
Whichever one you are.

529
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,335
Then I heard about
this thing in Omni...

530
00:38:27,498 --> 00:38:30,247
about this, um, meteor
making all this heat.

531
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:34,206
And it made diamond dust. That changed the
weather, and they died because of the weather.

532
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:37,256
Then my teacher tells me about this
book by a guy named Bakker. He says-

533
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:44,386
She said I should ride with you
because it'd be good for you.

534
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,429
The boat is now loading.

535
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:50,822
Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900-hour departure.

536
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,965
National Weather Service is
tracking a tropical storm...

537
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,111
National Weather Service is
tracking a tropical storm...

538
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:56,515
about 75 miles
west of us.

539
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:59,231
Aye-yi-yi-yi. Why didn't
I build in Orlando?

540
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:04,415
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll
spring south like the last one.

541
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:08,801
Ray, start
the tour program.

542
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:20,384
Hold onto your butts.

543
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:32,059
And why did they
put the fiberglass thing?

544
00:39:32,225 --> 00:39:34,112
I know.

545
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:37,370
What kind of dinosaurs
are we gonna see now?

546
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:40,918
Hey, lookit! A ghost, a ghost!
Aah! Oh, no. It's driving.

547
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,837
Turn in your fear at the door
and join the future, right?

548
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,814
Oh, God help us. We're
in the hands of engineers.

549
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:49,463
During most of your tour,
the appropriate information...

550
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:52,281
will be automatically selected
and displayed for you.

551
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:54,967
Hey, look! Simply touch the
area of the screen displaying...

552
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:57,011
the appropriate icon.
Are we gonna hit that?

553
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,899
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

554
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,558
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

555
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:20,949
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

556
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,864
We spared no expense.
If you look to the right,

557
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:29,493
you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

558
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,829
- Dilophosaurus!
- Oh, shit!

559
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,903
One of the earliest carnivores,

560
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:36,886
we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous,

561
00:40:37,016 --> 00:40:41,358
spitting its venom at its prey, causing
blindness and eventually paralysis,

562
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,210
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.

563
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:46,798
I can't see.
This makes Dilophosaurus...

564
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:49,357
a beautiful
but deadly addition...

565
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:53,138
to Jurassic Park.

566
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:01,362
Alan... where?

567
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:06,191
Damn.

568
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,485
Vehicle headlights are on
and they're not responding.

569
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:17,906
Those shouldn't be running off the car
batteries. Item 151 on today's glitch list.

570
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:21,230
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo,

571
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:24,264
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

572
00:41:24,402 --> 00:41:29,387
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands, and you have butterfingers?

573
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:33,231
I'm totally unappreciated
in my time.

574
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:37,070
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

575
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,029
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

576
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,981
You know anybody who can network
eight Connection Machines...

577
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:46,861
and debug two million lines of
code for what I bid for this job?

578
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:49,260
If you can, I'd love to
see him try. I'm sorry...

579
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,139
about your financial problems,
but they are your problems.

580
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,855
Oh, you're right, you're absolutely
right. Everything's my problem.

581
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:58,567
I will not get drawn into another
financial debate with you, Dennis.

582
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:01,516
I really will not. There's
been hardly any debate at all.

583
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,776
I don't blame people
for their mistakes,

584
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:07,625
but I do ask
that they pay for them.

585
00:42:07,756 --> 00:42:09,763
Thanks, Dad.
Dennis!

586
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:11,819
The headlights.

587
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,630
Yeah. I'll debug the tour
program when they get back, okay?

588
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:18,056
Okay? It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system for a while.

589
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,039
There's a finite amount
of memory.

590
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,839
You gonna compile for half an hour,
for crying out loud? Quiet! All of you!

591
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,304
They're approaching
the tyrannosaur paddock.

592
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:19,674
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

593
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:24,413
God creates man. Man destroys
God. Man creates dinosaurs.

594
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:27,867
Dinosaurs...

595
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:30,422
eat man.

596
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:33,877
Woman inherits the Earth.

597
00:43:39,871 --> 00:43:43,166
We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.

598
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:54,235
What's gonna happen
to the goat?

599
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:02,130
He's gonna eat the goat? Excellent.

600
00:44:02,268 --> 00:44:06,327
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

601
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,558
I happen to be
a vegetarian.

602
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:20,664
T
- Rex doesn't want to be fed. He wants to hunt.

603
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:25,681
Can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

604
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:49,131
Uh, uh, now, eventually you
do plan to have dinosaurs...

605
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,085
on your, on your
dinosaur tour, right?

606
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:55,082
Hello? H-Hello.

607
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:57,587
Yes?

608
00:44:57,717 --> 00:45:00,138
I really hate that man.

609
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:08,843
See, the tyrannosaur, uh, uh, doesn't obey
any set patterns or, or park schedules.

610
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,467
The essence, uh,
of chaos.

611
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:14,832
Um, I'm still not clear on
chaos. Wh-What does that mean?

612
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:19,632
Oh, oh, it simply deals with, uh,
unpredictability in complex systems.

613
00:45:20,882 --> 00:45:22,791
The shorthand is
the, the Butterfly Effect.

614
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:25,295
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking,

615
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:28,174
and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.

616
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,910
I go too fast. I did
a fly-by. I missed it.

617
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,789
Give me that glass of water. We're
going to conduct an experiment.

618
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,767
It should be still. The car's
bouncin' up and down, but that's okay.

619
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:41,578
Now, put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

620
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:44,199
Say a drop of water
falls on your hand.

621
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:47,302
Which way is the drop going
to fall off? Which finger?

622
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:50,220
Thumb, I'd say.

623
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,099
Aha. Okay. Now freeze
your hand. Don't move.

624
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,132
I'm going to do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

625
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:59,170
Which way is it going to roll
off? Let's say back, the same way.

626
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,260
S- Same way.
Back the same way.

627
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:03,721
It changed.

628
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:07,429
It changed. Why?
Because tiny variations:

629
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:11,076
uh, the orientation of the hairs on
your hands, Hey, Alan, look at this.

630
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:14,440
um, the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin-

631
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,799
Imperfections in the skin? Oh,
just... microscopic. Microscopic.

632
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,614
And never repeat and
vastly affect the outcome.

633
00:46:20,746 --> 00:46:23,047
That's... what?
Unpredictability.

634
00:46:23,178 --> 00:46:25,698
Right.

635
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,069
There.
Look at this. See?

636
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:31,233
I'm right again. Nobody could've
predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly,

637
00:46:31,432 --> 00:46:34,595
suddenly jump out of
a moving vehicle. Alan?

638
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:37,575
Alan! There's, uh, another example.

639
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:41,664
See, here I'm now by myself,
uh, er, talking to myself.

640
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,165
That's, that's
chaos theory.

641
00:46:44,295 --> 00:46:47,523
Stop the program.
Stop the program.

642
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:51,422
I told you how many times...

643
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,143
we needed locking mechanisms
on the vehicle doors?

644
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,382
Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.

645
00:46:56,517 --> 00:46:59,648
We're on.
Will notify for resume.

646
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:02,911
I'll switch it
over to TelePromp Ter.

647
00:47:03,076 --> 00:47:04,832
What about the circuit
integrities?

648
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:07,331
Screen says faulty sensor.

649
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,499
I'll call security.

650
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:12,220
We're a full go on that.
Looks good.

651
00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:15,932
Like I was saying, there's this
other book by a guy named Bakker,

652
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,881
- and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases.
- Where are we going?

653
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,799
You see something?

654
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:23,647
Is there anybody else who thinks
we shouldn't be out here?

655
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:26,679
His book was a lot fatter
than yours was. Really?

656
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:29,500
Yours was fully illustrated, honey. Hey.

657
00:47:29,665 --> 00:47:31,355
You okay?

658
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,237
Hey, look at this.
Wait. Hey, watch.

659
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:37,684
Hey, come on.
Watch this.

660
00:47:37,887 --> 00:47:41,597
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

661
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:44,629
Everybody stay here.

662
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,473
Timmy!
Hey, Timmy-

663
00:47:57,629 --> 00:48:00,378
Oh, wow.

664
00:48:00,508 --> 00:48:02,712
Okay?
Of course.

665
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:09,109
Don't be scared. It's okay.
Muldoon tranquilized her for me.

666
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:11,479
She's sick.

667
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,992
Oh, my God.

668
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,275
Hey! Hey, baby.

669
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:36,823
Hey, baby girl.

670
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:39,372
Yeah.

671
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:44,172
She was my favorite
when I was a kid.

672
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:48,019
Now I see her, she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

673
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:54,323
It's okay.

674
00:48:56,245 --> 00:48:59,343
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

675
00:49:00,596 --> 00:49:03,279
Thanks.
What are her symptoms?

676
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:06,161
Oh, imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing. Right.

677
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:09,356
It seems to happen about every
six weeks or so. Six weeks.

678
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:25,164
These are dilated.
Take a look. They are?

679
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:27,304
It's okay.
I'll be damned.

680
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,946
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

681
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,900
Is this West Indian lilac?

682
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:45,773
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat 'em.

683
00:49:48,782 --> 00:49:51,498
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.

684
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:55,756
There's only one way
to be positive.

685
00:49:55,884 --> 00:49:59,048
I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.

686
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,074
Dino... droppings, droppings? Yeah.

687
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,245
Yep. Yep.
Yeah, I got that.

688
00:50:10,411 --> 00:50:13,280
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

689
00:50:13,482 --> 00:50:16,232
We're gonna have to cut
the tour short, I'm afraid.

690
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:19,428
Pick it up again tomorrow where we
left off. Are you sure we have to?

691
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,667
It's not worth taking the chance. Well-

692
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:24,648
Sustained winds, 45 knots. Tell
them when they get back in the cars.

693
00:50:24,777 --> 00:50:27,527
Ladies and gentlemen, last
shuttle leaving for the dock...

694
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,664
leaves in approximately
five minutes.

695
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,549
Drop what you're doing
and leave now.

696
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,581
Damn!

697
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,348
That is
one big pile of shit.

698
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,273
You're right. There's no
trace of lilac berries.

699
00:50:54,405 --> 00:50:56,412
That's so odd,
though.

700
00:50:56,549 --> 00:51:01,218
All right, so she's suffering
from Melia toxicity...

701
00:51:01,348 --> 00:51:04,098
every six weeks.

702
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:09,537
Let's see.
Rats. Nada.

703
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:13,049
Every six weeks. She's, um... tenacious.

704
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:16,928
You have no idea.

705
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,832
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

706
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:36,728
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

707
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:39,132
You know,
if it's all right,

708
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:42,197
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the trike.

709
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:44,341
Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.

710
00:51:44,478 --> 00:51:48,023
I can drop her off at the visitor's
center before I make the boat.

711
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,076
Then I'll
catch up with you.

712
00:51:50,269 --> 00:51:53,138
You sure? Yeah. I wanna stay
with her a little longer.

713
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:55,577
Okay, then.
Okay.

714
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:58,676
Now!

715
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:13,745
There's nothing I can do. The
captain says we gotta go, we gotta go!

716
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:17,330
You gotta give me the time. I did a test
run on this thing. It took me twenty minutes.

717
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:21,142
I could maybe push it to eighteen, but
you gotta give me at least fifteen minutes.

718
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,055
No promises!

719
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:33,810
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

720
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:36,529
So much for our first tour.

721
00:52:36,663 --> 00:52:40,372
Two no-shows
and one sick triceratops.

722
00:52:40,503 --> 00:52:44,212
It could've been worse,
John. A lot worse.

723
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:46,251
Anybody want a soda
or something?

724
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:50,666
I'm going to the machine. I thought, you
know, maybe I'd get somebody something.

725
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:53,357
I've had only sweets, and
I'm gonna get something salty.

726
00:52:53,557 --> 00:52:55,826
I thought maybe
somebody would, uh-

727
00:52:55,925 --> 00:53:01,074
Oh, I finished debugging the phones. I was gonna debu
- So I did.

728
00:53:01,204 --> 00:53:03,789
You told me to, uh,
so I debugged the phones.

729
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:06,825
I should tell you the system
is gonna be compiling...

730
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,905
for, uh, eighteen
to twenty minutes.

731
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:11,944
Some of the minor systems might go on
or off, but it's nothing to worry about.

732
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,024
It's a simple thing.

733
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,894
You got any kids? Me?
Oh, oh, hell, yeah, three.

734
00:53:38,031 --> 00:53:40,649
I love kids.
Hmm.

735
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:43,597
Anything at all
can and does happen.

736
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:47,337
Same with wives, for
that matter. You married?

737
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:51,331
Occasionally.
Uh, yeah,

738
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:55,724
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

739
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:12,585
Five, four, three,
two, one.

740
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:22,149
That's odd.

741
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:26,371
What? Door security
systems are shutting down.

742
00:54:26,536 --> 00:54:29,951
Well, Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

743
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:28,638
By the way, Dr. Sattler, um,
she's not, like, available, is she?

744
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:33,404
Why?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

745
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:36,055
You two are, uh-
Yeah.

746
00:55:36,255 --> 00:55:39,353
Hey, what'd I touch?

747
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:41,975
Uh, you didn't touch
anything. We stopped.

748
00:55:49,405 --> 00:55:52,275
Whoa, whoa. What the
hell? What the hell?

749
00:55:52,413 --> 00:55:55,379
What now? Fences are
failing all over the park.

750
00:55:55,517 --> 00:55:57,426
Find Nedry!
Check the vending machines.

751
00:56:28,215 --> 00:56:31,477
Look at this workstation.
What a complete slob.

752
00:56:31,607 --> 00:56:34,541
The raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

753
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:42,002
No, no.
They're still on.

754
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:46,764
Why the hell would he
turn the other ones off?

755
00:57:25,297 --> 00:57:29,257
Access main program.
Access main security.

756
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:31,301
Access main program grid.

757
00:57:38,927 --> 00:57:42,406
Uh, uh, uh!
You didn't say the magic word.

758
00:57:42,606 --> 00:57:44,940
Uh, uh, uh! Uh, uh,
uh! Please! Goddamn it!

759
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:49,923
I hate this hacker crap! Call
Nedry's people in Cambridge.

760
00:57:50,061 --> 00:57:53,889
Uh, uh, uh!
Phones are out too.

761
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:58,338
Uh, uh, uh! Where did the vehicles stop?

762
00:58:18,505 --> 00:58:21,668
Their radio's out too.
Gennaro said to stay put.

763
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,167
Kids okay? I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?

764
00:58:24,264 --> 00:58:26,685
Kids get scared. What's
to be scared about?

765
00:58:26,824 --> 00:58:29,639
It's just a little hiccup in the
power. I didn't say I was scared.

766
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:32,484
I didn't say you were scared. I know.

767
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:35,004
Boo!

768
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:39,037
Hey, where did you find
those? Under my seat.

769
00:58:39,174 --> 00:58:41,345
Are they heavy?
Yeah!

770
00:58:41,478 --> 00:58:44,325
Then they're expensive.
Put 'em back.

771
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,388
Don't scare me.

772
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:04,924
Oh, cool. Night vision.

773
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:29,467
Do you feel that?

774
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:05,369
Maybe it's the power
tryin' to come back on.

775
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:09,655
What is that?

776
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:25,454
Where's the goat?

777
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,779
Oh,Jesus!

778
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:56,335
He left us. He left us.

779
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:09,866
Where does he think
he's going?

780
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:14,890
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

781
01:01:27,472 --> 01:01:29,992
Dr. Grant?

782
01:01:41,582 --> 01:01:44,549
Boy, do I hate
being right all the time.

783
01:01:53,036 --> 01:01:57,640
Keep absolutely still. Its
vision is based on movement.

784
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:15,234
Turn the light off.
Turn the light off.

785
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:18,631
Turn the light off!

786
01:03:11,937 --> 01:03:14,752
Turn- Turn it off!
I'm sorry!

787
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:17,881
I'm sorry!

788
01:03:18,017 --> 01:03:20,221
You're the one
who turned it-

789
01:03:58,971 --> 01:04:01,175
No!

790
01:04:18,968 --> 01:04:23,888
Hey!

791
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:25,878
Oh, God.

792
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:37,611
- Hey-hey! Hey-hey!
- Ian, freeze!

793
01:04:37,814 --> 01:04:41,588
Get the kids! Get rid of the flare!

794
01:04:41,782 --> 01:04:45,872
Get the kids! Get rid of the flare!

795
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:51,056
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with me-

796
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,773
Aaah!

797
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,977
No! No! Aaah-

798
01:05:11,057 --> 01:05:15,661
Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant!
Okay, Lex, I got ya.

799
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:19,534
I'm stuck!
The seat's got my feet!

800
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:22,543
I'll get you next.
You're okay. Dad! Dad!

801
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:27,210
You're all right.
Tim! Tim?

802
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:33,162
Don't move. He can't see us
if we don't move.

803
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:13,128
This way-
Wait, wait, wait!

804
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:16,583
Timmy? Timmy!
Tim!

805
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:37,823
Lex! Lex!
You're chokin' me!

806
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:44,387
Grab the wire!

807
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:03,998
"Keycheck space minus O, keychecks
off, safety space minus O."

808
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:07,774
He's turning the safety systems off. He doesn't
want anybody to see what he's about to do.

809
01:07:07,906 --> 01:07:10,655
Look at this next entry. It's the
kicker. "White rabbit object. "

810
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:14,363
It did it all, but with the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

811
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:17,976
The only way to find them is to go through
the computer's lines of code one by one.

812
01:07:18,176 --> 01:07:20,991
How many lines of code are
there? About two million.

813
01:07:21,152 --> 01:07:22,974
Two million?
Yeah.

814
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:28,860
Robert, I, I wonder if perhaps
you would be good enough...

815
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:33,562
to take a gas jeep and
bring back my grandchildren.

816
01:07:33,694 --> 01:07:36,444
Sure.

817
01:07:38,461 --> 01:07:41,777
I'm going with him.

818
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:46,935
John. John?
The magic word, the magic word-

819
01:07:47,068 --> 01:07:49,751
Uh, uh, uh!

820
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:53,658
I can't get Jurassic Park back
on-line without Dennis Nedry.

821
01:07:56,091 --> 01:07:58,611
Should have been there
by now.

822
01:08:00,027 --> 01:08:02,296
No damn good.

823
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:15,059
Oh, damn!

824
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:23,479
There's the road!

825
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:32,307
Winch this sucker off the thing and then
I tie it to that thing there and then I...

826
01:08:32,438 --> 01:08:34,740
pull down this thing
here and I-

827
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:39,147
Oh. Oh!

828
01:08:42,613 --> 01:08:46,574
My glasses!
I can afford more glasses.

829
01:08:59,827 --> 01:09:01,932
Oh, geez!

830
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,232
You got time, you got time.
You can do it!

831
01:09:16,368 --> 01:09:18,888
You can do it.
Come on, Dennis!

832
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:26,245
Hello?

833
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:33,291
Ha! Yeah, yeah,
that's nice. Gotta go.

834
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:46,243
Oh. Ah, nice boy.
Nice boy!

835
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,282
Nice dinosaur.

836
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:52,736
I thought you were one of your
big brothers. You're not so bad.

837
01:09:52,876 --> 01:09:55,875
What do you want? You
want food? Look at me.

838
01:09:56,043 --> 01:09:58,312
I just fell down a hill. I'm
soakin' wet. I don't have any food!

839
01:09:58,475 --> 01:10:01,671
I have no food on me.
I have nothing on me.

840
01:10:01,802 --> 01:10:05,664
Play fetch?
Play fetch?

841
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,624
Look, see?
See stick?

842
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:10,022
See stick?
Yeah, look, stick.

843
01:10:10,153 --> 01:10:14,375
Look, stick! Stick, stupid!
Fetch the stick, boy!

844
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:16,359
You like the stick?

845
01:10:16,488 --> 01:10:19,968
No wonder you're extinct.

846
01:10:20,104 --> 01:10:22,144
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

847
01:10:51,492 --> 01:10:53,347
Aaah!

848
01:10:53,475 --> 01:10:56,890
Aaah!

849
01:11:35,326 --> 01:11:37,846
Timmy? Timmy!

850
01:11:38,014 --> 01:11:40,250
Tim!

851
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:45,334
Now, Lex, listen, listen
to me. I'm right here.

852
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,151
I'm gonna look after you, but
I have to go help your brother.

853
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:50,705
So I want you to stay
right here and wait for me!

854
01:11:50,844 --> 01:11:52,884
He left us.
He left us!

855
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:56,914
But that's not...
what I'm gonna do.

856
01:11:57,051 --> 01:12:00,312
Okay?

857
01:12:00,443 --> 01:12:04,304
Stay here.

858
01:12:09,594 --> 01:12:11,382
Timmy?

859
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:30,284
Tim? You hear me?
I'm coming up.

860
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:34,894
I hate climbing. I hate
trees. Way too high.

861
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,408
Oh, goddamn tree.

862
01:12:39,573 --> 01:12:42,475
Hey, Tim?

863
01:12:45,813 --> 01:12:48,081
Tim?

864
01:12:55,123 --> 01:12:58,417
Tim.

865
01:13:01,906 --> 01:13:07,208
You okay? You okay? I threw up.

866
01:13:07,409 --> 01:13:10,704
Oh. Oh, that's okay.

867
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:15,948
Just give me your hand.

868
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,462
Hey, Tim, I won't
tell anyone you threw up.

869
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,152
Just, just
give me your hand.

870
01:13:29,998 --> 01:13:34,569
Here, I gotcha. Come on. Okay.

871
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:39,044
That's good. Over the wheel.
Don't pull me too hard.

872
01:13:39,213 --> 01:13:42,890
No hurry.

873
01:13:43,053 --> 01:13:44,962
Stand on the door.
Hang onto me.

874
01:13:45,164 --> 01:13:47,586
Okay, I got you.
Okay.

875
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:51,268
Okay, that's not too bad,
right, Tim? Yes, it is.

876
01:13:51,403 --> 01:13:54,250
Just like coming out of a tree house.
Did your dad ever build you a tree house?

877
01:13:54,379 --> 01:13:56,964
No!
Yeah, me too.

878
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,677
The thing about climbing is, you never,
never look down! This is impossible.

879
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,460
How am I gonna do this? It's about
50, 50 feet- I'm gonna help you-

880
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:11,812
Oh, no.
Tim, go!

881
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,379
Oh! Go, go, go!
Go, Tim, go!

882
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:45,947
Faster, Tim!

883
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:53,021
Tim, jump!

884
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:57,626
Go, Tim!

885
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:07,673
Well... we're back...
in the car again.

886
01:15:07,809 --> 01:15:11,583
Well, at least
you're out of the tree.

887
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,276
Where's the other car?
Where's the other car!

888
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:24,500
Alan!
Dr. Grant!

889
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:28,085
Alan!

890
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:32,989
Grant!

891
01:15:39,933 --> 01:15:44,155
I think this was Gennaro.
I think this was too.

892
01:15:44,284 --> 01:15:47,732
I think
it's ahead of us.

893
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:51,674
It could be anywhere. With the fences down, it
can wander in and out of any paddock it likes.

894
01:15:59,194 --> 01:16:02,609
He put a tourniquet on.
Ian. Ian!

895
01:16:02,745 --> 01:16:05,614
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

896
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:12,624
Can we chance
moving him?

897
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,582
Please chance it.

898
01:16:20,343 --> 01:16:24,237
Ellie, come on!

899
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:26,773
Wait, wait.

900
01:16:31,222 --> 01:16:33,677
The other car!

901
01:16:33,813 --> 01:16:36,202
Dr. Grant?

902
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:38,861
Alan!

903
01:16:38,997 --> 01:16:42,412
They're not here.

904
01:17:07,985 --> 01:17:10,635
Anybody hear that?

905
01:17:10,769 --> 01:17:15,853
It's a, um
- It's an impact tremor is what it is.

906
01:17:15,984 --> 01:17:18,733
I'm fairly alarmed here.

907
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:22,921
Come on, come on, come on. We gotta
get outta here. Now, now! Right now!

908
01:17:23,087 --> 01:17:26,861
Go, go, go!
Let's go!

909
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:29,739
Start the engine!

910
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:38,535
Must go faster!

911
01:17:38,669 --> 01:17:42,378
Here it comes! Fifth
gear! Shit! Shit! Shit!

912
01:17:48,299 --> 01:17:50,209
Get off the stick!
Bloody move!

913
01:17:50,348 --> 01:17:54,537
Look out!
Down!

914
01:18:16,519 --> 01:18:19,835
Think they'll have that
on the tour?

915
01:18:27,558 --> 01:18:30,874
Are you hearing this?

916
01:18:33,478 --> 01:18:38,299
Come on, Tim.
Come on, hurry up.

917
01:18:38,437 --> 01:18:42,692
Let's, uh, get up this tree. Oh, no.

918
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:46,431
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Try up here. I don't want to.

919
01:18:46,564 --> 01:18:49,662
Okay.
Oh, man.

920
01:18:49,795 --> 01:18:52,762
I hate trees.
They don't bother me.

921
01:18:52,898 --> 01:18:56,214
Oh, yeah, well,
you weren't in the last one.

922
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:11,798
Hey, those are brontosauruses.
I mean, uh, brachiosaurs.

923
01:19:11,937 --> 01:19:15,100
They're singing.

924
01:19:39,965 --> 01:19:43,193
Shh, shh!

925
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:45,560
Don't let the monsters come over
here! They're not monsters, Lex.

926
01:19:45,691 --> 01:19:47,993
They're just animals.
These are herbivores.

927
01:19:48,123 --> 01:19:51,897
That means they only eat vegetables, but
for you I think they'd make an exception.

928
01:19:52,027 --> 01:19:55,158
Tim. Oh, I hate the other kind.

929
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:59,796
The other kind just...
do what they do.

930
01:20:12,248 --> 01:20:14,321
Ooh! Aah!

931
01:20:17,591 --> 01:20:19,533
What's that?

932
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:28,623
What are you and Ellie gonna do now if you
don't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore?

933
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:33,776
I don't know. I guess...
we'll just have to evolve too.

934
01:20:36,085 --> 01:20:40,362
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

935
01:20:40,564 --> 01:20:43,281
I don't know. What do
you call a blind dinosaur?

936
01:20:43,412 --> 01:20:45,746
Do-you-think-he-saurus.

937
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:53,006
What do you call a blind
dinosaur's dog? You got me.

938
01:20:53,138 --> 01:20:55,953
A do-you-think-he-saurus'
Rex.

939
01:20:56,082 --> 01:20:59,115
Alan?

940
01:20:59,249 --> 01:21:04,038
Yeah? What if the dinosaurs
come back while we're asleep?

941
01:21:04,177 --> 01:21:06,992
Well, I'll stay awake.

942
01:21:07,121 --> 01:21:09,990
All night?

943
01:21:10,192 --> 01:21:13,094
All night.

944
01:21:55,946 --> 01:21:58,313
Hmph.

945
01:21:58,442 --> 01:22:02,020
They were
all melting.

946
01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:07,837
Malcolm's okay for now. I
gave him a shot of morphine.

947
01:22:10,248 --> 01:22:13,597
They'll be fine.

948
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,022
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

949
01:22:22,183 --> 01:22:24,965
You know the first...

950
01:22:25,126 --> 01:22:29,914
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland...

951
01:22:30,054 --> 01:22:33,501
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

952
01:22:33,637 --> 01:22:35,841
Really quite wonderful.

953
01:22:35,973 --> 01:22:39,966
We had, uh,
a wee trapeze and, uh,

954
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,888
a merry-go-

955
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:46,906
A carousel.
Huh.

956
01:22:47,107 --> 01:22:49,441
And a seesaw.

957
01:22:49,603 --> 01:22:53,083
They all move motorized, of course, but, uh,
people would say they could see the fleas.

958
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,479
"Oh, I can see the fleas, Mummy.
Can't you see the fleas?"

959
01:22:56,610 --> 01:23:01,049
Clown fleas and high-wire fleas
and fleas on parade.

960
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:10,392
But with this place,

961
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:14,521
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

962
01:23:14,687 --> 01:23:16,825
Something that was real.

963
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:20,732
Something that they could...

964
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:24,855
see and touch.

965
01:23:26,654 --> 01:23:30,810
An aim not devoid
of merit.

966
01:23:30,942 --> 01:23:34,770
But you can't think
through this one,John.

967
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:36,796
You have to feel it.

968
01:23:36,924 --> 01:23:42,139
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

969
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:45,912
Hiring Nedry was a mistake. That's
obvious. We're overdependent on automation.

970
01:23:46,075 --> 01:23:49,522
I can see that now. Now, the next
time, everything's correctable.

971
01:23:49,723 --> 01:23:51,511
John.
Creation...

972
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:55,832
is an act
of sheer will.

973
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:58,034
Next time,
it'll be flawless.

974
01:23:58,201 --> 01:24:01,584
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

975
01:24:01,721 --> 01:24:06,542
When we have control again
- You've never had control. That's the illusion!

976
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,614
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place!

977
01:24:09,752 --> 01:24:11,661
But I made a mistake too.

978
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,280
I didn't have enough respect
for that power and it's out now.

979
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:18,989
The only thing
that matters now...

980
01:24:19,158 --> 01:24:22,453
are the people we love.

981
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:26,028
Alan and Lex and Tim.

982
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:31,019
John, they're out there
where people are dying.

983
01:24:36,628 --> 01:24:39,017
So-

984
01:24:45,075 --> 01:24:47,922
It's good.

985
01:24:50,355 --> 01:24:53,867
Spared no expense.

986
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:21,640
Go away! It's okay, it's
okay. It's a brachiosaur.

987
01:25:21,806 --> 01:25:24,173
It's a veggie-saurus, Lex,
veggie-saurus.

988
01:25:24,334 --> 01:25:28,392
Veggie.
Come on, come on, girl.

989
01:25:28,558 --> 01:25:30,794
Come on.

990
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,380
Come on.
Come on, baby.

991
01:25:36,524 --> 01:25:40,004
Yo! All right!

992
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,816
I'm not letting go!

993
01:25:52,394 --> 01:25:55,623
Looks like it has a cold. Yeah, maybe.

994
01:25:55,786 --> 01:25:57,858
Can I touch it?
Sure.

995
01:25:58,058 --> 01:26:02,694
Just think of it as...
kind of a big cow.

996
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:06,501
I like cows.

997
01:26:14,888 --> 01:26:16,927
Hey, come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

998
01:26:17,062 --> 01:26:21,568
Come on, up here.

999
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:27,579
God bless you!

1000
01:26:30,693 --> 01:26:34,883
Yuck! Oh, great, now she'll
never try anything new.

1001
01:26:35,012 --> 01:26:37,947
She'll just sit in her room and never
come out and play on her computer.

1002
01:26:38,084 --> 01:26:40,833
I'm a hacker! That's what
I said. You're a nerd.

1003
01:26:40,963 --> 01:26:44,062
I am not a computer nerd. I
prefer to be called a hacker.

1004
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:48,473
Oh, God.

1005
01:26:49,987 --> 01:26:53,215
You know what this is?

1006
01:26:53,346 --> 01:26:55,767
It's a dinosaur egg.

1007
01:26:55,906 --> 01:27:00,477
The dinosaurs...
are breeding.

1008
01:27:02,113 --> 01:27:07,066
But, my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

1009
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,461
Amphibian DNA.
What's that?

1010
01:27:10,623 --> 01:27:15,031
Well, on the tour,
the film said they used...

1011
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:19,160
frog DNA to fill in
the gene sequence gaps.

1012
01:27:19,295 --> 01:27:22,229
They mutated the
dinosaur genetic code...

1013
01:27:22,366 --> 01:27:25,115
and blended it
with that of frogs.

1014
01:27:25,246 --> 01:27:30,330
Now, some West African frogs have been
known to spontaneously change sex...

1015
01:27:30,493 --> 01:27:35,227
from male to female
in a single sex environment.

1016
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:39,281
Malcolm was right.
Look.

1017
01:27:47,706 --> 01:27:51,186
Life found a way.

1018
01:27:51,323 --> 01:27:55,512
No, no, no, that's crazy.
You're out of your mind.

1019
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:58,358
Wait a minute,
what exactly would this mean?

1020
01:27:58,489 --> 01:28:02,351
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is about the only option left to us.

1021
01:28:02,521 --> 01:28:07,309
We will never find the command that Nedry
used. He's covered his tracks far too well.

1022
01:28:07,512 --> 01:28:09,999
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

1023
01:28:10,168 --> 01:28:12,557
So, shutting down
the entire system-

1024
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:15,345
You can get somebody else,
because I won't do it.

1025
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:20,431
Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything that he did.

1026
01:28:20,566 --> 01:28:24,014
Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back...

1027
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:26,539
on their original
start-up mode, correct?

1028
01:28:26,678 --> 01:28:29,808
Theoretically, yes. But we've never
shut down the entire system before.

1029
01:28:29,941 --> 01:28:32,591
It may not come back on at
all. Will we get the phones?

1030
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,666
Yes, again,
in theory.

1031
01:28:34,836 --> 01:28:37,225
What about the
lysine contingency?

1032
01:28:37,428 --> 01:28:39,402
We could put that into
effect. What's that?

1033
01:28:39,604 --> 01:28:42,124
That is absolutely
out of the question.

1034
01:28:42,292 --> 01:28:44,201
The lysine contingency is intended to
prevent the spread of the animals...

1035
01:28:44,371 --> 01:28:46,160
in case they ever
get off the island.

1036
01:28:46,291 --> 01:28:49,738
Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a
single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1037
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,722
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid lysine.

1038
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:56,297
Unless they're completely supplied with
lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1039
01:28:56,434 --> 01:28:59,662
People... are... dying.

1040
01:29:01,681 --> 01:29:05,674
Will you please
shut down the system?

1041
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:28,298
Hold onto your butts.

1042
01:29:34,348 --> 01:29:36,136
Um.

1043
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:49,095
It's okay.
Look. See that?

1044
01:29:49,226 --> 01:29:51,877
It's on.
It worked.

1045
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:54,825
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
it worked? Everything's still off.

1046
01:29:54,953 --> 01:29:57,222
Maybe the shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

1047
01:29:57,353 --> 01:29:59,742
All we have to do is turn
them on, reboot the system:

1048
01:29:59,881 --> 01:30:02,499
telephones, security doors, half
a dozen others, but it worked.

1049
01:30:02,632 --> 01:30:04,868
System's ready.
Where are the breakers?

1050
01:30:05,001 --> 01:30:06,756
Maintenance shed,
the other end of the compound.

1051
01:30:06,888 --> 01:30:09,254
Three minutes, I can have power
back on in the entire park.

1052
01:30:09,415 --> 01:30:12,230
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

1053
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:15,903
until Mr. Arnold returns and the
whole system is running again.

1054
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,925
I'm tired, I'm hot.
I'm dirty, my legs hurt.

1055
01:30:18,118 --> 01:30:20,006
Just keep going, guys.

1056
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:24,638
The visitors center is just
about a mile over that rise.

1057
01:30:24,773 --> 01:30:28,122
Just... keep-

1058
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:29,821
What is that?

1059
01:30:30,757 --> 01:30:33,920
Tim. Tim, can you tell me
what they are?

1060
01:30:36,324 --> 01:30:40,285
Gr- Ga, uh, uh,
gala-

1061
01:30:40,419 --> 01:30:42,393
Uh, gallimimus.

1062
01:30:42,563 --> 01:30:45,661
Are, are those, um,
meat-eating?

1063
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:47,964
Um, meat-asaurusses?

1064
01:30:52,866 --> 01:30:55,102
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes...

1065
01:30:55,233 --> 01:30:59,226
just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

1066
01:30:59,361 --> 01:31:02,809
They're, uh-
They're flocking this way.

1067
01:31:43,643 --> 01:31:45,617
I wanna go now.
Look how it eats.

1068
01:31:45,787 --> 01:31:49,583
Please! I bet you never look
at birds the same way again.

1069
01:31:49,786 --> 01:31:53,527
Yes.
Go now.

1070
01:31:53,658 --> 01:31:58,229
Okay. Keep low
and follow me.

1071
01:31:58,361 --> 01:32:00,630
Look how much blood.

1072
01:32:02,201 --> 01:32:05,070
Oh, God.
Something went wrong.

1073
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:07,379
Something's happened.

1074
01:32:07,512 --> 01:32:11,123
Something's wrong.

1075
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:13,262
This is just a delay.

1076
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:15,886
All major theme parks
have delays.

1077
01:32:15,991 --> 01:32:20,114
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked. John.

1078
01:32:20,278 --> 01:32:22,449
But,John, if Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,

1079
01:32:22,614 --> 01:32:25,483
the pirates don't eat the
tourists. I can't wait anymore.

1080
01:32:25,685 --> 01:32:29,133
Something went wrong. I'm
gonna go get the power back on.

1081
01:32:29,269 --> 01:32:31,690
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know.

1082
01:32:31,828 --> 01:32:35,308
Don't let's be too hasty.
He's only been gone-

1083
01:32:37,268 --> 01:32:40,301
I'm going with you.
Okay.

1084
01:32:54,097 --> 01:32:55,885
Sorry.

1085
01:32:59,697 --> 01:33:03,755
This isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light,

1086
01:33:03,888 --> 01:33:07,117
but I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

1087
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:13,067
Right.

1088
01:33:16,782 --> 01:33:20,294
But, uh... it ought
to be me really going.

1089
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:23,593
Why? Well, I'm
a- And you're, um-

1090
01:33:23,757 --> 01:33:26,757
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

1091
01:33:26,957 --> 01:33:29,804
We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.

1092
01:33:29,997 --> 01:33:33,542
You just take me through this
step-by-step. I'm on channel two.

1093
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:35,531
Right.

1094
01:34:05,256 --> 01:34:08,998
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1095
01:34:09,127 --> 01:34:12,029
The shutdown must have
turned off all the fences.

1096
01:34:12,167 --> 01:34:15,363
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the raptor fences.

1097
01:34:20,837 --> 01:34:22,626
Come on, this way.

1098
01:34:28,772 --> 01:34:31,674
I can see the shed
from here.

1099
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:33,883
We can make it
if we run.

1100
01:34:34,052 --> 01:34:37,150
No. We can't.

1101
01:34:37,284 --> 01:34:40,666
Why not? Because we're being hunted.

1102
01:34:40,803 --> 01:34:44,185
Oh, God. In the bushes, straight ahead.

1103
01:34:46,595 --> 01:34:50,871
It's all right.
Like hell it is.

1104
01:34:51,009 --> 01:34:55,831
Run.
Towards the shed.

1105
01:34:55,969 --> 01:34:58,424
I've got her.

1106
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:00,381
Go! Now!

1107
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:21,300
Mr. Arnold?

1108
01:35:23,357 --> 01:35:26,357
Mr. Arnold?
John, I'm in.

1109
01:35:26,493 --> 01:35:28,697
Great. Now,

1110
01:35:28,829 --> 01:35:31,163
ahead of you
is a metal staircase.

1111
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:36,213
Go down it.
Okay. Going down.

1112
01:35:36,379 --> 01:35:38,583
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

1113
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:43,288
Have her follow the main cable. I
understand how to read a schematic.

1114
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:14,510
I guess that means
the power's off.

1115
01:36:26,869 --> 01:36:29,716
That's not funny.
That was great.

1116
01:36:31,956 --> 01:36:35,152
Well, maybe, we could-

1117
01:36:50,866 --> 01:36:53,287
Damn it.
Dead end.

1118
01:36:53,425 --> 01:36:55,530
Uh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1119
01:36:55,697 --> 01:36:59,308
There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.

1120
01:36:59,409 --> 01:37:02,376
Ellie, look above you.

1121
01:37:02,512 --> 01:37:05,992
There should be a large bundle of cable
and pipes all heading in the same direction.

1122
01:37:06,128 --> 01:37:10,088
- Follow that.
- Okay. Following the piping.

1123
01:37:12,558 --> 01:37:14,347
Timmy, I bet I could
climb over the top...

1124
01:37:14,478 --> 01:37:17,161
and be on the other side
before you could get to the top.

1125
01:37:17,294 --> 01:37:20,393
What would you give me?
Respect.

1126
01:37:20,526 --> 01:37:22,664
Come on, guys,
it's not a race.

1127
01:37:23,981 --> 01:37:29,098
I see the box.
It says "high voltage. "

1128
01:37:29,196 --> 01:37:31,465
Yeah. Okay.

1129
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,800
Okay.

1130
01:37:37,387 --> 01:37:42,471
Good. Here we go.
Over the top.

1131
01:37:42,603 --> 01:37:45,864
Take your time, Tim.
That's good. Come on.

1132
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:49,506
Find your footing.
Find your footing.

1133
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:53,285
Ellie, you can't throw
the main switch by hand.

1134
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:56,646
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

1135
01:37:56,777 --> 01:37:59,329
It's large,
flat and gray.

1136
01:37:59,464 --> 01:38:02,879
All right,
here I go. Okay?

1137
01:38:03,016 --> 01:38:08,351
One, two,
three, four.

1138
01:38:08,487 --> 01:38:10,374
Okay. Charged.

1139
01:38:10,502 --> 01:38:12,390
Under the words
"contact position"...

1140
01:38:12,551 --> 01:38:17,122
there's a round, green button
which says, "push to close. "

1141
01:38:17,254 --> 01:38:21,596
"Push to close. "
Okay.

1142
01:38:21,733 --> 01:38:23,675
Push it.

1143
01:38:31,012 --> 01:38:33,564
Ah!

1144
01:38:36,451 --> 01:38:41,568
Now, Ellie, the red buttons turn
on the individual park systems.

1145
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:43,586
Switch 'em on.

1146
01:38:54,593 --> 01:38:56,764
Timmy! You're gonna have
to jump! Get down now!

1147
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,838
You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.

1148
01:38:58,976 --> 01:39:01,845
Do what Dr. Grant says! Let
go! I'll count to three! One,

1149
01:39:01,983 --> 01:39:04,733
two, three!

1150
01:39:04,863 --> 01:39:07,252
Control room.
Tour.

1151
01:39:07,391 --> 01:39:10,707
I'm coming up. I'm coming up to
get you. Lex, I've gotta get Tim.

1152
01:39:10,847 --> 01:39:12,951
Okay. I'm gonna
count to three.

1153
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:16,918
One,

1154
01:39:18,397 --> 01:39:20,252
two-

1155
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:25,205
Timmy!
Timmy!

1156
01:39:29,404 --> 01:39:31,379
He's not breathing.

1157
01:39:35,835 --> 01:39:39,380
Mr. Hammond, I think
we're back in business!

1158
01:39:39,514 --> 01:39:42,067
Oh, my God!

1159
01:39:46,298 --> 01:39:48,566
Goddamn!

1160
01:39:57,752 --> 01:39:59,988
Oh, Mr. Arnold.

1161
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:15,725
Clever girl.

1162
01:41:35,243 --> 01:41:37,632
Tim!

1163
01:41:37,771 --> 01:41:40,520
No, Tim!

1164
01:41:42,634 --> 01:41:45,895
Good boy,
good boy.

1165
01:41:46,025 --> 01:41:48,708
Good boy,
good boy, Tim.

1166
01:41:48,842 --> 01:41:51,776
Three.

1167
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:57,189
Hello?

1168
01:42:05,671 --> 01:42:09,947
Okay. I'm gonna
have to find the others,

1169
01:42:10,086 --> 01:42:12,541
get you to a doctor.

1170
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:17,563
Lex, you look after Tim. Hey! Yeah.

1171
01:42:17,701 --> 01:42:21,498
Your hair is
all sticking up.

1172
01:42:21,637 --> 01:42:24,636
Big Tim,
the human piece of toast.

1173
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:30,398
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

1174
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:53,593
Ellie!

1175
01:42:55,648 --> 01:42:58,746
- Run.
- Ellie!

1176
01:44:11,062 --> 01:44:14,160
It's just the two raptors,
right?

1177
01:44:14,262 --> 01:44:17,490
You sure the third one's contained? Yes.

1178
01:44:17,622 --> 01:44:20,207
Unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1179
01:44:44,913 --> 01:44:46,768
Timmy, what is it?

1180
01:44:46,897 --> 01:44:50,509
It's a velociraptor.

1181
01:44:50,641 --> 01:44:53,357
It's inside.

1182
01:45:14,702 --> 01:45:17,320
Follow me.

1183
01:47:46,809 --> 01:47:48,948
It's in there.

1184
01:47:49,145 --> 01:47:51,250
Control room.

1185
01:47:55,224 --> 01:47:57,012
We can call for help?

1186
01:47:57,143 --> 01:48:00,372
We gotta
reboot the system first.

1187
01:48:02,359 --> 01:48:04,333
The door locks!

1188
01:48:04,471 --> 01:48:06,358
Ellie, boot up
the door locks!

1189
01:48:09,558 --> 01:48:11,597
God!

1190
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:17,299
No, boot up the door locks!

1191
01:48:17,461 --> 01:48:19,948
Ellie, get back!
Boot up the door locks!

1192
01:48:20,149 --> 01:48:22,832
You can't hold it
by yourself!

1193
01:48:30,068 --> 01:48:33,613
It's a UNIX system.
I know this.

1194
01:48:33,747 --> 01:48:37,162
It's all the files of the whole
park. It tells you everything.

1195
01:48:37,298 --> 01:48:39,120
Um, I gotta find
the right file.

1196
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,803
Try to reach the gun!

1197
01:48:49,745 --> 01:48:51,567
I can't get it
unless I move.

1198
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:08,387
Oh, this is it!
This might be the right file.

1199
01:49:08,526 --> 01:49:11,722
Wait. It's coming.
This isn't the right file.

1200
01:49:14,733 --> 01:49:17,667
Come on, Lex!
Oh!

1201
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:26,112
You got it?
Yes!

1202
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:30,154
You got it!

1203
01:49:30,284 --> 01:49:32,323
Yes! Yes, this is it! Yes!

1204
01:49:35,787 --> 01:49:40,390
What works? Phones, security
systems; you name it, we got it.

1205
01:49:48,969 --> 01:49:53,246
- Grant?
- Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1206
01:49:53,384 --> 01:49:56,285
The children all right?
The children are fine.

1207
01:49:56,488 --> 01:50:00,284
Call the mainland. Tell 'em
to send the damn helicopters.

1208
01:50:00,487 --> 01:50:01,861
Gonna cut through the glass!

1209
01:50:05,254 --> 01:50:06,464
Grant!

1210
01:50:06,534 --> 01:50:07,876
Grant!

1211
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,385
Move! Quickly!
Tim, move!

1212
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:39,864
Tim, let go. Yeah.

1213
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:55,149
Aaah!

1214
01:52:51,792 --> 01:52:53,799
Hold onto me!
Mr. Hammond!

1215
01:52:53,935 --> 01:52:56,586
After careful consideration,
I've decided...

1216
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,679
not to endorse your park. So have I.
