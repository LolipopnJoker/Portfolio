1
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,123
Six times three.

2
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,890
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

3
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:08,288
Hurry up.

4
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,790
It's eighteen. Ooh!

5
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:25,957
Ring the bell three times,

6
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:28,725
put your helmet on the ground.
You're done.

7
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:38,058
Commence! You don't make
it, you do it again!

8
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,824
You ever been tested this
hard ever in your life?

9
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:40,923
Never.

10
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:45,792
Winning here is a
conscious decision.

11
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:50,225
Make up your mind
if you want to pass

12
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:53,792
or choose to fail.

13
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,659
All right now, gentlemen,
I'm gonna introduce y'all

14
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:59,560
to something called "not
being able to breathe."

15
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,093
Andrew! Come back.

16
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,658
Come back to the light.

17
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,326
All this shaking and all
this cold. Harness it.

18
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,625
Turn it into aggression.

19
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,827
You just proved to your
bodies, through your mind,

20
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,928
that you can push yourself further
than you thought possible.

21
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,294
Go get wet! Run!

22
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,061
I'm at my limit, so...

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,294
...that's it.

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,828
You sure you want to be here?
Yes, I do.

25
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,127
Are you absolutely sure?

26
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:00,460
I'm positive!

27
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,961
Whatever you have to do!

28
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,728
Just find an excuse to win.

29
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:18,228
Keep going.

30
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,829
It pays to be a winner!

31
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:31,131
I like having my buddies
that I can depend on.

32
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:33,430
And I would like for them
to be able to depend on me.

33
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,696
These guys are our
band of brothers.

34
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:41,965
<i>♪ Silent night</i>

35
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,631
<i>♪ Holy night</i>

36
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:49,631
<i>♪ All is calm</i>

37
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:53,299
<i>♪ All is bright.</i>

38
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,633
There's a storm inside of us.

39
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,068
I've heard many team
guys speak of this.

40
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,033
A burning.

41
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,033
A river.

42
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,168
A drive.

43
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,201
An unrelenting desire
to push yourself

44
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,869
harder and further than
anyone could think possible.

45
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:48,071
Pushing ourselves into
those cold, dark corners.

46
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,002
Where the bad things live.

47
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,469
Where the bad things fight.

48
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,603
We wanted that Fight
at the highest volume.

49
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,302
Aloud fight.

50
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:16,804
The loudest, coldest, darkest,

51
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,271
most unpleasant of the
unpleasant fights.

52
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,842
Is this doable?

53
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,043
It's expensive.

54
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:46,643
How much?

55
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:50,713
It's an Arabian horse, man.
She got good taste.

56
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:52,810
I know.

57
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:54,576
How much?

58
00:08:55,609 --> 00:08:58,278
I'll find out. Expensive.

59
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:00,177
You're fucked, man.

60
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,978
I know.

61
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:24,079
I'm up.

62
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:28,344
Going down.

63
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,283
Murphy by 1.1.

64
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,317
More than that. More
than that, Marcus.

65
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:20,383
Fucking dude, I was being
generous. Trust me.

66
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,917
Who won?

67
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,051
Murph. Murph, barely.
By one second.

68
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:26,115
Barely.

69
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,049
Barely. Head shave?

70
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,852
Head shave or what? I don't know, you
know? It's something to think about.

71
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,983
If I shave his head, I
have to focus on his face.

72
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,952
Face, ears. Oddly-shaped head.

73
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,385
Well, I don't wanna be looking
at him that close, either,

74
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,808
but he has been running his mouth
about beating you. Really?

75
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,350
Fuck, a head shave is fair.

76
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,550
Axe? Better shave him.

77
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:48,453
Make him go eat with the E-3s, work
in the chow hall until it grows back.

78
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:49,651
Frankie, what do you think?

79
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,076
Why the fuck wouldn't
we shave him?

80
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:52,283
That's valid.

81
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,085
Patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?

82
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,820
Let me see you make a
tactical decision right now.

83
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,951
Well, I could go
both ways on this.

84
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,618
He did lose, but he was close.

85
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,853
And you're Mike Murphy.

86
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,418
You are Mike Murphy.

87
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,585
The Mike Murphy.

88
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:07,252
I would've expected a
bigger separation.

89
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,586
That is a good point.
Backhanded compliment.

90
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,553
Patton. Grab my razor.

91
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:12,618
Razor, copy that.

92
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,951
Listen up.

93
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,687
Red Wings' a go.
Tonight, 1800.

94
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:22,552
Beautiful.

95
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:23,719
Am I going?

96
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,319
PLO in an hour.

97
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:30,185
Maybe I'll go.

98
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,556
It's a maybe. I'll give you
a maybe. Stay optimistic.

99
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,887
Boys. Hey, what's up?

100
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:38,887
What the fuck am
I doing wrong?

101
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,820
Oh, come on.

102
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,764
I'll tell you what, Shane,
here's your first op.

103
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,620
You ready?

104
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:47,987
Clean all this up.

105
00:12:58,587 --> 00:13:02,056
The objective of this mission is
to capture and kill Ahmad Shah.

106
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:05,656
Bad guy. Senior
Taliban commander

107
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,756
responsible for killing Marines
in eastern Afghanistan.

108
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,054
A Tier I target.

109
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,457
If you want a positive I.D.,
note that Shah has no earlobes.

110
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:19,188
Taraq.

111
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:22,023
His right-hand man. Seems to do
most of his chief shit for him.

112
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,223
We're going in with a
four-man Recon team.

113
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:34,291
Axelson, you'll be point.
Myself, I'll be second.

114
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,024
Dietz, comms.
Marcus, rear, med.

115
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,022
Axe, give us our route.

116
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:41,391
We're gonna be moving up the
back side of this Mountain here,

117
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:43,924
which is gonna offer great
concealment from the village.

118
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,889
I'm estimating that it's
gonna take us between

119
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:50,192
three and four hours, depending
upon the gradient of the terrain

120
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,826
which is that crappy shale.

121
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:54,890
So please lace up.

122
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,392
First things first. You're
gonna win the fight.

123
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:05,691
No medicine in a gun fight.

124
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:08,226
Two weeks ago, Team 8 was
near where we're gonna be.

125
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,968
Capelli got bit
by a rattlesnake.

126
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,291
Contrary to popular belief,
there is poison oak,

127
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:14,394
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.

128
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,058
Murph's got the sat phone.

129
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:24,727
The angle of this region is very
steep. Expect typical comms problems.

130
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,892
We're gonna be on
two-hour comms windows.

131
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:31,027
If we miss two windows, I'd say wake
somebody up. If not, don't sweat it.

132
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:34,527
Way point one is Budweiser.
Way point two is Miller.

133
00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:36,625
Three is Corona.
Four is Heineken.

134
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:38,926
And for our O.P. 1,
Schlitz Malt Liquor.

135
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:41,993
And if and when we I.D.
Shah, pass Rick James.

136
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:54,261
Gentlemen, these are your Rules of
Engagement. US forces will comply

137
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:56,427
with the Law of Armed
Conflict at all times.

138
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,026
Use of deadly force
is authorized.

139
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,592
Allahu Akbar!

140
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,759
If you do come under attack,

141
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:08,095
use the appropriate force necessary
to deter or defeat that threat.

142
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:20,697
Leaving here at 1800. Two
Chinooks and two Apaches.

143
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:24,896
We fly here to the L.Z., insert
the four-man team right here.

144
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,095
Then we fly 30
minutes to J-Bad.

145
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,363
Here, we'll have 15 team guys

146
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:34,629
and about a dozen Marines
standing by all night.

147
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:38,863
When we hear "Schlitz Malt
Liquor", we're heading back

148
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,228
to Ba-gram for phase two.

149
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:45,297
The QRF will stay
here at J-Bad.

150
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:48,296
Now the Apaches stay
with the Black Hawks.

151
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:51,797
The movement is so we can
get the 47's back here

152
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:55,297
ready to bring up to phrase
two, once you get eyes on Shah.

153
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,596
Oh,

154
00:15:56,662 --> 00:16:00,399
I bringing up tomorrow night's new
guy presentation to 1400 today,

155
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:03,797
so that all may
revel and partake.

156
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,096
You better be good, Napoleon.

157
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:07,228
Fuck.

158
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:10,163
A lot of moving parts.

159
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,796
We were going to wait and then
she gets her head into it

160
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:25,398
and when she gets her head
into something, that's it.

161
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:28,199
There's no stopping her, man.
She's going all out.

162
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:30,164
You know, you should
just let her do it.

163
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,565
You got a handyman woman.
That's a good thing.

164
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,465
He's afraid of losing
control over his castle.

165
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,031
He's having control issues
'cause he's the one

166
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,064
who's always made the taste
decisions in the family, right?

167
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,299
No, she's got great taste.
I... I trust her.

168
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,431
Well, what does she like?

169
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:45,964
Rose Honeydew.

170
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,032
Oh. Is that a color?

171
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:50,097
Mm-mmm.

172
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,464
You better control
that situation.

173
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,098
It's very ongoing.

174
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:56,266
New grass leads to new
bushes by the windows,

175
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,732
leads to new curtains,
leads to new sofa,

176
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:00,599
leads to new carpet,
leads to new floor.

177
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:01,798
New baby.

178
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:03,542
Dude, she's pregnant?
How far along is she?

179
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:04,798
You know if it's
a boy or a girl?

180
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,334
No, she's not pregnant. She's
just on a weird journey,

181
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,867
moving through the house,
one room to the next.

182
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:11,532
Sounds expensive.
Sounds pregnant.

183
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,533
Congratulations.

184
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:24,267
You're fucking late.

185
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:25,965
Sir, I'm good to go.

186
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:27,065
No.

187
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,700
You should introduce yourself

188
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,564
and tell us something
about you we don't know.

189
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:33,632
All right. Petty Officer...

190
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:34,966
Oh, shut up!

191
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,299
Get out!

192
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,800
Shut the fuck up!

193
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:39,966
Hey. Settle down.

194
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:42,304
Give the kid a chance. Remember
what it was like for you.

195
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,000
Petty Officer...

196
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,501
Who gives a shit!

197
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,301
Shut the fuck up!

198
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,068
Mr. Patton, please.

199
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,568
There we go.

200
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:17,468
More neck.

201
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:21,737
Come on, dude, you got to
get into it. Lose yourself.

202
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,801
Yeah!

203
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,701
Whoa!

204
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,235
Whoo!

205
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:38,170
Really, really bad.

206
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:39,536
Dude, that was traumatizing.

207
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,070
Can we vote to
push him through?

208
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,202
Because I can't see
that ever again.

209
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:44,670
Hands up. Push him through!

210
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:46,403
I don't know. Can he say it?

211
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,204
Can you say it? Prove it!

212
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,505
I don't want to watch you
dance again. I really don't.

213
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:51,648
Can you say it, Mr. Patton?

214
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,204
I can say it, I can say it.

215
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:56,936
Uh... Don't fuck it up.

216
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,738
Come on. No more fucking around.
Come on.

217
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:11,005
Been around the world twice.
Talked to everyone once.

218
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:13,738
Seen two whales fuck. Been
to three world fairs.

219
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,239
I even know a man in
Thailand with a wooden cock.

220
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:20,573
I push more Peter more
sweeter and more completer

221
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:22,438
than any other Peter
pusher around.

222
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,772
I'm a hard-bodied,
hairy-chested,

223
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:29,139
rooting tooting shooting,
parac' hutting

224
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,940
demolition double-cap
crimping frogman.

225
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,672
There ain't nothing
I can't do.

226
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,474
No sky too high, no sea too
rough, no muff too tough.

227
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:39,572
Learned a lot of
lessons in my life.

228
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:43,907
Never shoot a large-caliber man
with a small-caliber bullet.

229
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:46,740
Drive all kinds of trucks.

230
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:49,007
Two-bys, four-bys, six-bys.

231
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:52,908
And those big motherfuckers
that bend and go, "ssh-ssh"

232
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:54,640
when you step on the brakes.

233
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,008
Anything in life worth doing is worth
overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.

234
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:03,076
I'm a lover, I'm a fighter,
I'm a UDT Navy SEAL diver.

235
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,107
I'll wine, dine, intertwine,

236
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:07,441
and sneak out the back door
when the refueling is done.

237
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,097
So if you're feeling froggy,
then you better jump,

238
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,408
because this frogman's been there,
done that and is going back for more.

239
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:14,473
Cheers, boys.

240
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,308
She does not need
an Arabian horse!

241
00:20:32,473 --> 00:20:33,873
How the fuck do you
know about that?

242
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:35,909
I know everything, Murphy.

243
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,676
More a Tennessee
Walker cross stallion.

244
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,809
The original Silver. The
Lone Ranger's horse.

245
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,208
No shit.

246
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:52,643
Glorious horse, Murphy.
Glorious!

247
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:03,479
Razor 11, 64 is two Mikes out.
Establish over watch at 1000 AGL.

248
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:12,810
All right, Commander,
approaching the L.Z.

249
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:13,943
One Mike on the deck.

250
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,642
One minute!

251
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,677
Thirty seconds.

252
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,742
Thirty seconds!

253
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:32,712
Roger. Establish over
watch at 5000 MSL.

254
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:35,445
Bruno 64 will be a fast rope
infill. Stand by, Commander.

255
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:39,845
Good Hoyer. Hold your hover.

256
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:42,144
Rope's deployed.

257
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,177
First team member on rope.

258
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:45,345
Go!

259
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,478
First man on the ground.

260
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:55,078
Second man on the rope.

261
00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:56,711
Hey. Next one, Shane, okay?

262
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:59,312
Have fun, you lucky bastard!

263
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:14,814
Lulu 06, Bruno 64
infill complete. RTB.

264
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,482
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.
Radio check.

265
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:46,347
Spartan O-1, this
is Apollo 2-2.

266
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:49,048
We'll be with you for the next
six hours. Have a nice walk.

267
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:52,382
Apollo 2-2, this is Spartan O-1.
Copy.

268
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,914
Comms check. Check.

269
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:55,347
Check.

270
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:56,813
Check.

271
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,616
Spartan O-1, I passed Budweiser.
How copy?

272
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,516
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.
Good copy. Budweiser.

273
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,815
Apollo 2-2.

274
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:24,184
Spartan O-1 hit Miller.

275
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:30,183
Sir, Spartan O-1
passes Miller.

276
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:33,984
Spartan O-1, Spartan base.
I copy. Miller.

277
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:47,417
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.

278
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:49,649
It's Corona.

279
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,984
Looks like they're doing
pretty good, Chief.

280
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,985
Apollo 2... Spartan O-1.

281
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,383
It's Hein...

282
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:07,918
Say again, your last?

283
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,484
Spartan O-1. Here's Heineken.

284
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,951
How copy?

285
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,250
Good copy.

286
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:14,918
Spartan O-1 passes Heineken.

287
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,622
It's the final way point.
Call it in.

288
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:30,490
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Radio check.

289
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,888
Spartan... Spartan O-1.

290
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:39,656
Spartan O-1, this is Beast master. Say
again. You're weak and unreadable.

291
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,955
Take a peek.

292
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,388
Spartan Base.

293
00:25:48,454 --> 00:25:49,454
Shit.

294
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:51,133
Can't see half the village.

295
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,923
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.
I say again.

296
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,023
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.

297
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,755
Good copy.

298
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:00,122
Sir, intermittent comms
with Spartan O-1,

299
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:01,508
but they have
arrived at the O.P.

300
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:05,454
All right, fellas.

301
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:08,658
Our boys are safe and
secure for the day.

302
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:11,057
Team one, back to
Ba-gram with me.

303
00:26:11,788 --> 00:26:15,959
Team two, enjoy your time
here at J-Bad. Nighty-night.

304
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,557
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.

305
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,356
Sun's up. We're out.
Good luck.

306
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:25,489
A- firm.

307
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:35,057
Find a new spot?

308
00:26:36,723 --> 00:26:37,890
Let's try to make that peak.

309
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,791
See if that's not better.

310
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:42,791
Sounds good.

311
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,125
Boys all set?

312
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:03,793
They're all set. They're
in position. All's good.

313
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,559
Enjoy your night. Sleep well.

314
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,759
Enjoy yours, brother.

315
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:08,825
Thanks, Pete.

316
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,793
Glorious day. Eh, Patton?

317
00:27:13,057 --> 00:27:14,324
Yes, sir.

318
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:18,993
We good?

319
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:20,657
Yeah. They arrived
about 30 minutes ago.

320
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:22,826
Should be digging in nice
and tight right about now.

321
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:48,630
- Zulu 06, Bruno 64 is wheels
up. J. - Bad, enrooted Ba-gram.

322
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,796
Marcus, on me.

323
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:28,131
Danny, take our six. Inform
command of our new position.

324
00:28:29,528 --> 00:28:31,864
Axe. Eyes on.

325
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:02,097
Goddamn. Shit.

326
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,099
That's a lot more
than 10 guys.

327
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,465
That's a fucking army.

328
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,131
Four guys on the right.

329
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:31,965
Red scarf.

330
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:35,166
No earlobes.

331
00:29:42,632 --> 00:29:43,699
Ooh!

332
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:47,133
Super freak. That's
Rick James, bitch.

333
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:50,399
You make that shot?

334
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,168
Negative. Wouldn't
have authority anyway.

335
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,134
Dietz, we got Shah P-I.D# d.
Call in Rick James.

336
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,199
Fuck, yeah.

337
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:04,000
Axe, you sexy in there?
You comfy?

338
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:05,667
Solid. Advise on target.

339
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:07,801
Danny, you make comms yet?

340
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,266
No joy.

341
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:10,734
Fuck.

342
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,866
We're too exposed.

343
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:17,301
What do you think?
Keep Axe at O.P. 1?

344
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,969
Move back twenty-five
yards, set up O.P. 2?

345
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,133
Roger that.

346
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,868
Axe, you're on surveillance.

347
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:30,172
Dietz, fall back to O.P. 2 and
get me some fucking comms.

348
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:34,005
Spartan Base, this
is Spartan O-1.

349
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:35,705
Radio check. How copy?

350
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,103
Hey, L.T.

351
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:38,270
Yeah.

352
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:39,868
If we're home by the
15th, me and Morgan

353
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:41,867
are gonna cut down all the
trees around the stable.

354
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,271
How is that gonna help me?

355
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,570
Hello?

356
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,672
Brahms horse auction
is, I think, the 27th.

357
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:51,139
That means if I cut down the
trees behind the stable,

358
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:52,443
I get a discount
for your horse.

359
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,104
Do they sell Arabic horses?

360
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,641
First of all, it's not an Arabic
horse, okay? It's an Arabian horse.

361
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:58,705
Arabic.

362
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:00,905
It's... You're from
New York, okay?

363
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,805
How much is an Arabic horse?
It's Arabian horse.

364
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,871
How much is an Arabian horse?

365
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:08,306
No less than 15 grand.

366
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,972
Fifteen fucking grand?

367
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:11,738
Hell of a wedding present.

368
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,106
Is that redhead a bridesmaid?
Radio check. How copy?

369
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:24,706
Melissa? The redhead, dude.

370
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:25,838
The one with freckles
on her nose.

371
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:26,972
The cute one from the
Cold play concert.

372
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:28,373
That's Melissa.

373
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,839
Is she coming? She's
a bridesmaid.

374
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:31,740
Yeah. Is she coming?

375
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:36,674
She's a bridesmaid. Yes.

376
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,506
Did she ask about me? No.

377
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:45,642
Mikey, I'm good here. I'm
going to break down O.P.1.

378
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:47,140
Copy that.

379
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:57,343
Listen up. At 0930, we move to
high ground and make comms.

380
00:32:58,673 --> 00:33:01,776
Marcus, Axe, shut her down.
Dietz, you got security.

381
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,008
Rest up, gents.

382
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,775
Can you get off the radio
while you're chewing?

383
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:17,543
You're making me nauseous.

384
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:35,346
Mikey, you see this?

385
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:43,113
What the fuck is this?

386
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:54,779
Oh, shit.

387
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,348
Get down!

388
00:35:43,415 --> 00:35:44,516
Down!

389
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:55,184
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

390
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,282
Get up.

391
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:58,849
Get your hands back.

392
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,583
Spartan Base, Spartan O-1.

393
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:01,982
Stepped right the fuck on me.

394
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:09,153
What the fuck is this? What the
fuck? Are you talking to Taliban?

395
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:12,416
Fucking Tali.

396
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:16,885
Saying again. This is
Spartan O-1. Over.

397
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,450
Come on. Come on.

398
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,551
Hey, eyes down. Eyes down.

399
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,817
Eyes down. Eyes down.

400
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:24,949
Motherfuck.

401
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,885
Axe. Eyes on him,
what he does.

402
00:36:41,516 --> 00:36:42,684
Fuck.

403
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:46,286
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Over.

404
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:52,085
Danny, your radio working?

405
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,152
So now I'm going
to be that guy

406
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,652
calling on an unsecured sat line
because your shit ain't functioning.

407
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:00,755
Talk to the Mountain, sir.

408
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,985
Eyes down. Eyes down.

409
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,185
Motherfuck.

410
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,619
You know, it's feeling
like a cursed op.

411
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:18,587
It's not a cursed op.
There's no curses.

412
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:20,220
It's just Afghanistan.
That's all.

413
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:29,453
J- Bad TOC, Sergeant
Hasslert speaking.

414
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,455
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.
Do you hear me?

415
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,019
Hello.

416
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,786
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.

417
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:38,988
Yes, yes, I can hear you, sir.

418
00:37:39,053 --> 00:37:41,121
I am calling on an
unsecured line.

419
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,785
I need to speak to the C.O.
immediately.

420
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:44,687
The C.O.? That's correct.

421
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:45,887
Which C.O., sir?

422
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:47,120
Commander Kristensen.

423
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,654
Commander Kristensen
isn't here, sir.

424
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:51,187
Ah, he's at Ba-gram.

425
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,687
Yes, that's correct, sir.

426
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,489
I need you to transfer me
to Ba-gram Ouellette TOC.

427
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,954
Now.

428
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,188
Roger that, sir. Stand by.

429
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,759
Ouellette. Petty
Officer Patton.

430
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,889
Patton, Mike Murphy.

431
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,522
You're looking
for Mike Murphy?

432
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:14,422
This is Mike Murphy.
Do you copy?

433
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:15,721
Mike?

434
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:18,955
This connection sucks.
What's up, man?

435
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:21,323
Patton, get me
the Skipper now.

436
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,089
He's sleeping, sir.

437
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:24,488
Wake him the fuck up.

438
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:27,823
Did you say wake him up, sir?

439
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:29,889
Right fucking now.

440
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:31,323
Roger that.

441
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,589
Murph wants me to
wake the Skipper.

442
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:37,023
Mike Murphy? Yeah.

443
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:39,023
That's Mike Murphy?
Well, go get him.

444
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,957
Commander Kristensen?

445
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:55,690
Commander Kristensen?

446
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:00,790
Sir, sorry, sir.

447
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,524
I got Lieutenant Murphy on the
phone for you in the TOC.

448
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:03,988
He says he needs to
talk to you now.

449
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,491
Which one?

450
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:18,658
Right there.

451
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,859
Mike? Mike?

452
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:25,391
Oh, it dropped.

453
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:27,126
Mike?

454
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,859
It's dead. What did he say?

455
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:32,043
Uh, just that he
needed to talk to you.

456
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,358
Why is Murphy calling
on a sat phone?

457
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,993
No idea.

458
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:40,127
Are we having comms
problems with Spartan O-1?

459
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:43,193
We were good for a while, but we've
missed two windows now, sir.

460
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:44,792
Two.

461
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:47,727
Try him back! For fuck's sake.

462
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:10,195
Fuck! Worst fucking comms.

463
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:11,927
Well, we could light
the goats on fire,

464
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:12,993
smoke signal our
way out of here.

465
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:15,527
Yeah, I could walk down to the
village, ask to borrow a phone.

466
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:17,995
You'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.

467
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,895
Afghan Dirt Brown,
Goat Skin Blond.

468
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,293
Shit, she'll dig that a
hell of a lot more than,

469
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,627
what is it, fucking
Honey Cream?

470
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,229
Sit down. Sit down!

471
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:46,228
Way I see it, we
got three options.

472
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,930
One, we let them go, hike up.

473
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,064
We'll probably be found
in less than an hour.

474
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:57,964
Two, we tie them up,
hike out, roll the dice.

475
00:40:58,694 --> 00:41:02,497
They'll probably be eaten by fucking
wolves, or freeze to death.

476
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:08,162
Three?

477
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:09,730
We terminate the compromise.

478
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:30,666
Shah's down there. We let them go,
we're letting him go. Mission fails.

479
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,797
No, Mikey.

480
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,599
I don't like it. I don't
fucking like it at all.

481
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:47,365
What are we gonna do? We
gonna kill them? Huh?

482
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,466
Okay, we kill them, right? What,
then what? Fucking bury 'em?

483
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:52,098
They get found, then what?

484
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,498
Then what?

485
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:55,098
What do you mean, then what?

486
00:41:55,163 --> 00:41:56,765
And then what?

487
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,632
You know then what.

488
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:00,999
What do you think? This
shit's gonna be private?

489
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:03,303
Huh? It's gonna be out there
for the whole fucking world.

490
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:06,134
CNN, okay? "Seals kill kids."

491
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:07,531
That's the fucking
story forever.

492
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:09,555
It's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.

493
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:14,701
We do what we do.
What we have to do.

494
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:17,433
This is the fucking Navy and
you're the fucking boss,

495
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:19,766
so you make the
fucking call, sir.

496
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:28,068
Shah killed 20
Marines last week.

497
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:30,266
Twenty.

498
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,469
We let him go, 20 more
will die next week.

499
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:38,869
Forty more the week after that.
Our job is to stop Shah.

500
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,869
Why do these men have the right
to dictate how we do our job?

501
00:42:44,499 --> 00:42:46,667
Rules of Engagement says
we cannot touch them.

502
00:42:47,366 --> 00:42:48,835
I understand.

503
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,167
And I don't care.

504
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:56,014
I care about you.
I care about you.

505
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:58,034
I care about you.
I care about you.

506
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:00,970
I don't want your mom
seeing your head,

507
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:04,169
your decapitated
head on Al Jazeera.

508
00:43:05,534 --> 00:43:06,668
That is Shah.

509
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,834
I don't see it that way.

510
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:12,971
Where do you think he's running
to? 200 friends down there.

511
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:16,270
Got guys in Leavenworth doing
20 for taking home trophy guns.

512
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:17,401
What do you think
they're gonna do

513
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:20,037
for two fucking kids and
an old fucking man?

514
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:21,936
Fucking look at them, man.

515
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,502
They fucking hate us.

516
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:30,806
Look, at him. That's not a kid, that's a
soldier. That's death. Look at death.

517
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,603
We can't do it. Look
at that soldier.

518
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,603
They are unarmed prisoners.

519
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:38,872
And the second they run down there,
we got 200 hajis on our backs.

520
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:40,169
Tie 'em up.

521
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:41,402
Tie 'em up. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

522
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:43,537
We can't just fucking
leave 'em, let 'em go!

523
00:43:43,602 --> 00:43:45,470
I thought you were standing by
waiting for your fucking orders?

524
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:47,404
I am standing by waiting
for my fucking orders.

525
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:48,837
What do you think
that radio's for?

526
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:50,403
They're not calling
Domino's Pizza.

527
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:51,703
I know what the
fucking radio's for.

528
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:53,070
That radio's fucking Tali.

529
00:43:53,135 --> 00:43:54,470
It's a cell phone
to the Taliban.

530
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:57,372
So you just think it'll just
be our little secret? Huh?

531
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:01,871
That's a warrior.

532
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:03,169
Schwack them.

533
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,738
We cannot do that.

534
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:08,871
This is a soft compromise.

535
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,135
You want to go to Leavenworth?

536
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:12,239
You don't know how many hajis
they have down there, man.

537
00:44:12,303 --> 00:44:13,504
Don't let him influence you.

538
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,804
Marcus, I'm just saying,
you can't just say...

539
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,104
Look at that child.

540
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,972
Make up your fucking mind and
don't let him influence you.

541
00:44:18,037 --> 00:44:19,071
Schwack them.

542
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:20,906
Mikey, it's your fucking call.
I ain't fucking voting.

543
00:44:20,971 --> 00:44:22,706
This is not a vote.

544
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:27,841
This is what we're gonna do.
This op is compromised.

545
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:33,739
So we're going to
pack up everything.

546
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:37,074
We're gonna cut them loose and
we're gonna make this peak.

547
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:40,140
When we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.

548
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:44,876
When we get these comms up, we're gonna
call for extract and we're going home.

549
00:44:46,204 --> 00:44:47,305
Roger that, sir.

550
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:49,072
Roger that. Roger.

551
00:44:49,137 --> 00:44:51,073
Spartan O-1. Spartan
O-1, do you copy?

552
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:52,807
Fisher? Coffee.

553
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:56,441
Spartan O-1, radio
check, do you copy?

554
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:04,810
Radio check for Spartan O-1.
Radio check. Spartan O-1.

555
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:12,542
Spartan O-1... Spartan
O-1, do you copy?

556
00:45:18,206 --> 00:45:19,640
Where are you guys going?

557
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:21,474
Just got called north!

558
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,707
We're QRF!

559
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:24,107
We have troops in contact!

560
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:25,708
But we're fucking QRF!

561
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:28,108
We're going! We have TIC!

562
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:37,575
What the fuck is
with the Apaches?

563
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,842
Troops in contact.

564
00:45:38,907 --> 00:45:42,610
Limited resources, Chief.
There ain't enough Apaches.

565
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:45,508
That's fucked up.

566
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:47,208
They'll be back.

567
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:03,842
Hey. Hey.

568
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,643
You just won the lottery.

569
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:52,015
Any station, listen up.
Please relay to Spartan O-1.

570
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:55,882
Spartan to base, do you copy?

571
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,783
Spartan O-1, Spartan O-1
to base, do you copy?

572
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:26,583
Fuck.

573
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,718
Oh, fuck!

574
00:48:53,716 --> 00:48:55,184
False summit.

575
00:49:05,216 --> 00:49:06,550
Fuck! Yeah.

576
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,084
Danny, get me some comms.

577
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,487
Come on. Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1. Over.

578
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,418
What do you want to do?

579
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,152
Go home. Get in bed,
watch Anchorman.

580
00:49:17,384 --> 00:49:18,782
Yeah, Roger that.
What do you think?

581
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:20,984
I think we did
the right thing.

582
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:22,450
I think we let our
love light shine.

583
00:49:22,716 --> 00:49:24,051
Fuck me!

584
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:26,419
I mean, isn't that
how things work?

585
00:49:26,484 --> 00:49:28,018
Good things happen
to good people?

586
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:29,652
This is a bad spot.

587
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:32,753
Danny, I got nothing here
on sat. Give me something.

588
00:49:32,817 --> 00:49:33,856
I don't have fucking shit.

589
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:36,152
How do you feel?

590
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:37,952
This is a bad spot.

591
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:40,219
You okay?

592
00:49:40,452 --> 00:49:41,553
All set.

593
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:45,687
Good. Let's fall back to that
tree line. Wait till sundown.

594
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,686
If we can't make comms, we're
walking home anyways, gents.

595
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,153
Let's get some rest.

596
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:50,986
Pack up, let's move.

597
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:53,120
Fuck.

598
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:05,554
Spartan O-1, Spartan
to base, do you copy?

599
00:50:06,386 --> 00:50:09,055
Spartan O-1, radio
check, do you copy?

600
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,653
Sir, they've now
missed three windows.

601
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,820
Okay.

602
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,788
Commander Shriver, there's
a call for you on line 17.

603
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:27,021
Roger.

604
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:33,454
Commander Shriver.

605
00:50:33,753 --> 00:50:34,821
Uh, sir, this is Erik.

606
00:50:34,887 --> 00:50:38,991
For your S.A., we have missed three
comm windows with Spartan O-1.

607
00:50:39,488 --> 00:50:42,122
Last known comms were at 0700.

608
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:43,786
Why am I hearing this
from you right now?

609
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:46,590
Sir, we expected to have
some comms problems.

610
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:49,823
Murphy and I discussed and agreed
that we would not start a spin

611
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:51,422
until after he
missed two windows.

612
00:50:51,888 --> 00:50:53,688
Is there a fucking
problem here, Erik?

613
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:56,390
Sir, I've told you everything
I have at this point.

614
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:58,323
I will call you when I
have more information.

615
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,223
This is Commander
Kristensen out.

616
00:51:02,288 --> 00:51:03,390
Fuck.

617
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:36,296
I'm going to do some Recon.
Be back in two minutes.

618
00:52:36,725 --> 00:52:39,028
You want some company?
Negative.

619
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,730
I'm going to do about two minutes
of Recon. Be right back.

620
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:52,497
We're about to get contacted.

621
00:54:00,896 --> 00:54:02,764
How fucking fast
are these guys?

622
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:03,930
Fast.

623
00:54:04,762 --> 00:54:05,864
What are you thinking?

624
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,227
I'm thinking we're about getting fixing
to get into a pretty good gun fight.

625
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:11,530
Copy that.

626
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:14,332
Looks like I voted wrong.

627
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,496
Negative.

628
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:18,198
We just got the opportunity

629
00:54:18,263 --> 00:54:21,233
to make hell fucking strong contact
with our friend from the other side.

630
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:22,431
Job well done.

631
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:24,665
Hoo-yah to that, sir.

632
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,399
Danny, get ready to fight.

633
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:40,132
Hey, Mikey...

634
00:54:42,264 --> 00:54:44,166
I'm about ready to
punch that time card.

635
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,531
Do it.

636
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,435
Push left! Marcus, move!

637
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:09,334
Moving!

638
00:56:41,603 --> 00:56:43,271
Motherfucker.

639
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:04,406
Spartan Base, this
is Spartan O-1.

640
00:57:05,404 --> 00:57:07,807
Request immediate QRF!
Troops in contact!

641
00:57:10,005 --> 00:57:12,406
Fuck! Fuck.

642
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:20,407
Fucking shit! Motherfuck!

643
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,406
Motherfucker!

644
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:33,139
Allahu Akbar!

645
00:57:36,672 --> 00:57:38,508
Contact, twelve o'clock!

646
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:01,306
Axe?

647
00:58:01,974 --> 00:58:03,008
Yeah.

648
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:11,442
Mikey. Left is good.

649
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,208
I say again, left is good.

650
00:58:21,441 --> 00:58:22,608
Mikey!

651
00:58:22,941 --> 00:58:26,311
Left is not good! I say
again, left is not good!

652
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,476
Roger that! Push right!

653
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:46,876
We are good right.

654
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,111
Push right. Push right.

655
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:50,176
Push right.

656
00:58:53,642 --> 00:58:54,910
Murph, down!

657
00:58:58,843 --> 00:59:00,376
Goddamn motherfuckers!

658
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:03,078
Fuck you!

659
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,276
Smoke out!

660
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,878
Hey! Consolidate on Mikey!

661
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,079
Shit! Fuck!

662
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:27,879
Right is no good!
Right is no good!

663
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:29,911
Move!

664
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:39,413
Back! Back!

665
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,245
First man!

666
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,781
Mikey! Consolidate on me!

667
00:59:55,545 --> 00:59:56,679
Fuck.

668
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,381
I think we can take 'em, Mikey,
but we're gonna need a new spot!

669
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:11,715
Roger that! Danny, comms!

670
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:14,848
Negative! Radio's down
hard, it took some rounds!

671
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,248
You got crypto? Yeah!

672
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,147
Gas the fucking
radio, we're moving!

673
01:00:19,313 --> 01:00:20,380
Roger that!

674
01:00:22,246 --> 01:00:23,313
Shit!

675
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:28,381
Ow, fuck!

676
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:31,148
Ow! Fuck!

677
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:35,348
Marcus, on me!

678
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,581
Fuck!

679
01:00:40,414 --> 01:00:41,748
We're falling back!

680
01:00:41,881 --> 01:00:42,983
You mean fall off?

681
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:44,381
Yeah! Fuck!

682
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:45,714
Axe!

683
01:00:46,247 --> 01:00:47,916
Axe, on me!

684
01:00:48,147 --> 01:00:50,415
Ready? Move it!

685
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:54,916
Ready? Roger!

686
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:56,483
Go, go, go!

687
01:01:04,382 --> 01:01:05,449
Jesus.

688
01:01:06,615 --> 01:01:07,682
Shit.

689
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:12,149
Oh, my God.

690
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:18,016
Fuck.

691
01:01:58,183 --> 01:01:59,519
I lost my rifle.

692
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:03,219
My rifle. My...

693
01:02:06,784 --> 01:02:07,919
Shit.

694
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:22,352
You see? God's
looking out for us.

695
01:02:22,418 --> 01:02:26,155
If that's God looking out for
us, I'd hate to see him pissed.

696
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:29,188
Oh, God... thank
you, thank you!

697
01:02:32,285 --> 01:02:33,720
Where's Axe?

698
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,154
That sucked.

699
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:40,453
They fuck... They
fucking shot me.

700
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:41,721
Living in the past, Danny.

701
01:02:41,786 --> 01:02:43,145
We're all shot, bro.
Can you fight?

702
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:46,121
Messed up my drawing hand,
that pisses me off.

703
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,121
All right, we're good.

704
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:51,620
We just gotta get
to flat ground,

705
01:02:51,686 --> 01:02:53,921
then we take these
motherfuckers, that's it.

706
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:02,421
Fucking foot!

707
01:03:02,587 --> 01:03:04,589
Goddamn, this sucks! Oh, fuck.

708
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,355
Fuck you.

709
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:11,855
Fuck!

710
01:03:15,854 --> 01:03:18,056
Damn! Fucking burns!

711
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:19,955
Danny. I can fight.

712
01:03:21,221 --> 01:03:22,856
Way to go, buddy.

713
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:28,722
Peel left! Peel left!

714
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:30,489
Last man!

715
01:03:31,054 --> 01:03:33,189
Let me see it. You okay?
Give me your arm. Yeah.

716
01:03:34,954 --> 01:03:36,356
Whoa. Passing to the left!

717
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,189
Come on down!

718
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:21,691
Danny!

719
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,158
Let's go.

720
01:04:23,591 --> 01:04:25,492
Get them up! Come on.

721
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:35,692
Come on.

722
01:04:36,592 --> 01:04:37,592
Come on.

723
01:04:37,658 --> 01:04:38,824
Over...

724
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:43,659
Come on.

725
01:04:43,991 --> 01:04:45,159
Come on!

726
01:04:45,558 --> 01:04:48,627
Come on. Come on. Come on.

727
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:53,628
Come on. Find a fucking strap.

728
01:04:53,692 --> 01:04:55,160
Get him up. Get him up.

729
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,960
Come on. Fuck.

730
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:02,027
Get him. Get him up.

731
01:05:15,826 --> 01:05:17,827
Fuck. Fuck.

732
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:30,629
I got two mags, one frag.

733
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:33,828
Hey.

734
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,061
Oh, man.

735
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,429
Hey.

736
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:42,861
Oh.

737
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,562
This is bad here.

738
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:45,861
Mm.

739
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:47,028
This is a fucking problem.

740
01:05:48,827 --> 01:05:50,496
Fucking no comms.

741
01:05:50,894 --> 01:05:52,296
Fucking comms.

742
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,639
You're okay, right? Shot
me up pretty good, bro.

743
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,830
This hand, let me see.

744
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:04,399
You're all right. Look at me.
Hey, look at me.

745
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:06,729
You okay? Huh?

746
01:06:06,794 --> 01:06:09,298
Suck it the fuck up, okay,
Danny? You're a fucking frogman.

747
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:12,231
Fuck, I lost my med kit.

748
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:14,665
You got a little hit in the
leg, okay? Look it here.

749
01:06:14,996 --> 01:06:16,297
You okay?

750
01:06:17,596 --> 01:06:19,197
Hold on. Okay.

751
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:20,963
There.

752
01:06:21,029 --> 01:06:25,366
Okay? Okay. Okay. Lay back.
Lay back.

753
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:28,832
Let me see, Mikey. Come here.
Let me see it.

754
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:31,330
Fuck.

755
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,231
You pack it with some fucking
dirt, tight, you hear me?

756
01:06:36,397 --> 01:06:38,731
Keep it packed
tight, all right?

757
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:41,532
I fucking love Afghanistan.

758
01:06:42,063 --> 01:06:43,632
Come here, buddy. Hold up.
Yeah, we're all set.

759
01:06:43,696 --> 01:06:45,533
Let me see. Let me see you.

760
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:46,731
Get your head down.
Let me see.

761
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:47,831
All right, heads down.
Get your head down.

762
01:06:47,897 --> 01:06:50,199
Let me see you. Come here.
Keep your head down.

763
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:53,165
Let me see you. I'm good.

764
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:55,832
Yeah, I know you're good.
I know you're good. Easy.

765
01:06:56,164 --> 01:06:58,232
Mikey, how'd they get us
so fast? Shut the fuck up!

766
01:07:01,098 --> 01:07:02,766
Do you fucking see them?

767
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:04,032
Bro...

768
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:08,334
I just don't understand how
fucking fast they were, man.

769
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:10,467
Oh, fuck. I just...

770
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:12,566
Fucking faster than we are?

771
01:07:13,131 --> 01:07:14,299
They're not faster than us.

772
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,933
I was fucking
talking to my mom.

773
01:07:16,998 --> 01:07:19,633
She didn't fucking
say nothing about...

774
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:22,015
She didn't fucking say nothing!
Danny, suck it the fuck up.

775
01:07:29,533 --> 01:07:32,469
Oh, fuck, such vivid reds. Oh!

776
01:07:32,698 --> 01:07:34,033
We got to move, Mikey.

777
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:47,834
Fuck. Mikey, what do you want?

778
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,067
Axe, smoke!

779
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,367
Smoke up!

780
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:51,535
Smoke 'em!

781
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,301
Oh, they're coming!

782
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,035
Get the fuck up and get
your fucking legs working,

783
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:58,268
you hear me? Yeah.

784
01:07:58,334 --> 01:07:59,667
Come on, let's go!

785
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:06,835
Let's go!

786
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:09,735
You got Danny? I got him.

787
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,636
Axe, we're moving down!
Move where?

788
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:13,401
Down!

789
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:15,668
Good to go.

790
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:29,403
Danny! Danny!

791
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:37,572
RPG. RPG.

792
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:42,872
Fuck!

793
01:09:54,139 --> 01:09:55,139
You good Danny?

794
01:09:57,805 --> 01:09:59,604
Where's Danny? Where's Danny?
I don't see him.

795
01:10:01,372 --> 01:10:03,140
Is he hit? Is he hit?

796
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:04,273
Is he hit?

797
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:06,973
Where is he? Where's Danny?
I don't see him.

798
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:08,106
Where is he?

799
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:10,007
He's up top. What?

800
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,640
He's up top. He got... Where?

801
01:10:11,706 --> 01:10:12,973
He got hit in the head.
Up top where?

802
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,307
Fuck.

803
01:10:14,472 --> 01:10:16,041
We gotta go get him.
Up top where?

804
01:10:16,107 --> 01:10:17,266
We got to go get him. Up top.

805
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:19,008
Where's Danny? Did he get hit?

806
01:10:19,073 --> 01:10:20,107
We got to go get him.
We gotta get him.

807
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:21,308
We got to get up
there and get him.

808
01:10:21,373 --> 01:10:23,208
We can take 'em on flat ground.
We gotta get up top.

809
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,874
We get up there, we get
him, get him down the hill,

810
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,374
and then we can take 'em on flat
ground. We take 'em on flat ground.

811
01:10:26,573 --> 01:10:28,007
Fuck!

812
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:33,742
Come on! Axe, get up here now!

813
01:10:34,174 --> 01:10:35,174
Get him up here.

814
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:37,076
Come on, Axe, you
gotta get down!

815
01:10:58,308 --> 01:10:59,709
Oh, fuck!

816
01:11:00,342 --> 01:11:02,310
We're gonna go
get Danny up top

817
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,476
and then we're gonna come back
down and fight on flat ground,

818
01:11:04,574 --> 01:11:06,343
we're gonna kill 'em all.

819
01:11:06,408 --> 01:11:07,509
Marcus, you good?

820
01:11:08,675 --> 01:11:09,776
I'm good!

821
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,710
Axe, you're security,
and let's go.

822
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:13,076
Roger.

823
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:14,243
Let's move.

824
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,344
Moving!

825
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,244
Let's move!

826
01:11:36,743 --> 01:11:39,179
You can die for your country.
I'm going to live for mine.

827
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:41,377
Fuck.

828
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:43,912
Fuck!

829
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,812
Marcus, move!

830
01:11:50,576 --> 01:11:51,911
Moving!

831
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:05,579
I don't think we can
get up from here.

832
01:12:05,644 --> 01:12:07,283
We ain't out-fucking
flanking 'em, Mikey.

833
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:09,611
We got to find another way.

834
01:12:27,946 --> 01:12:29,280
M-4.

835
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,580
I'm going to make
the call to QRF.

836
01:12:33,846 --> 01:12:36,347
You ain't making no fucking comms
with that sat phone, Mikey.

837
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:38,013
Look at me.

838
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:41,348
I'm going to make the call.

839
01:12:46,413 --> 01:12:48,414
No. No, Mikey.

840
01:12:50,013 --> 01:12:51,581
No. Fuck that.

841
01:12:59,114 --> 01:13:02,083
No. No. Fuck that, Mikey.

842
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:04,415
Take it. You fucking take it.

843
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:07,647
Mikey, give me the fucking...

844
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:24,781
I'm sorry, Mike.

845
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:26,848
For what?

846
01:13:29,415 --> 01:13:31,174
That we haven't killed
more of these fuckers.

847
01:13:31,648 --> 01:13:35,185
Oh, don't be fucking sorry. We're
gonna fucking kill way more of 'em.

848
01:13:36,815 --> 01:13:37,816
Fuck!

849
01:13:43,248 --> 01:13:44,416
Marcus.

850
01:13:47,182 --> 01:13:48,917
Never out of the fight.

851
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:01,751
What's he doing, Marcus?

852
01:14:02,582 --> 01:14:05,052
Murphy's moving!
Murphy's moving!

853
01:14:10,783 --> 01:14:12,451
Where is he going?

854
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,586
Oh, fuck!

855
01:14:30,817 --> 01:14:32,085
Murphy's moving!

856
01:14:42,818 --> 01:14:43,886
Oh, fuck.

857
01:14:53,184 --> 01:14:54,786
I am the Reaper.

858
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,453
Fuck.

859
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,221
Fucking A.

860
01:15:22,286 --> 01:15:23,453
Fuck!

861
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:10,858
J- Bad TOC. Sergeant Hasslert.

862
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:14,926
This is Lieutenant Mike Murphy.
Spartan O-1.

863
01:16:15,422 --> 01:16:17,190
We need immediate air support.

864
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:22,423
We need help.

865
01:16:22,522 --> 01:16:27,094
We are heading down the ravine
towards the Chichal Village.

866
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,990
Roger that, Murphy.

867
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:31,658
We need immediate CAS.

868
01:16:31,756 --> 01:16:33,992
Lieutenant, I need
your ten-digit grid.

869
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:35,423
Please hurry, sir.

870
01:16:35,489 --> 01:16:37,290
Murphy, I need those grids.
Thank you.

871
01:16:37,356 --> 01:16:39,892
Oh, God.

872
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:41,123
Lieutenant.

873
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:43,792
Lieutenant, can you hear me?
Lieutenant!

874
01:16:43,857 --> 01:16:45,925
Lieutenant, Get me the grids!

875
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:50,624
Lieutenant!

876
01:18:04,427 --> 01:18:08,598
Let's go, guys! Everybody,
let's move! Let's really move!

877
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,729
Let's go, let's go!

878
01:18:11,527 --> 01:18:13,396
Lulu 06, Bruno 6-4.

879
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:16,197
Wheels up, Ba-gram,
with QRF of 1-6 Eagles.

880
01:18:18,929 --> 01:18:20,596
No go, no go!

881
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:22,929
No go! You're grounded!

882
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:24,962
What's the fucking problem?

883
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:27,798
These Black Hawks cannot
fly without Apache cover!

884
01:18:28,562 --> 01:18:30,563
Where are the fucking Apaches?

885
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:32,897
On their way back now.
They're turning around.

886
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:34,897
This is fucking unbelievable!

887
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:35,961
No shit!

888
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:40,430
Sir, we are four Mikes
out from the zone.

889
01:18:40,495 --> 01:18:41,495
Four Mikes!

890
01:18:42,328 --> 01:18:43,997
Look alive, gentlemen.

891
01:18:44,129 --> 01:18:49,067
Bruno 64 report Mike Bravo
plus five. Altimeter 2998.

892
01:19:06,864 --> 01:19:08,364
Where's Mike?

893
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:13,598
Where's Murphy?

894
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:15,398
Up top.

895
01:19:15,963 --> 01:19:17,465
Where up top?

896
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:18,698
He's getting the QRF.

897
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,231
Where exactly is Mike?

898
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:28,034
If I knew exactly where the fuck
he was, I would tell you, brother!

899
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,898
Is he squared away?

900
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:33,065
Oh, fuck. Let me see you.

901
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:35,232
Oh.

902
01:19:36,164 --> 01:19:37,833
Motherfuckers.

903
01:19:39,298 --> 01:19:41,299
Did they really shoot
me in the fucking head?

904
01:19:42,632 --> 01:19:44,066
Yeah, buddy.

905
01:19:59,298 --> 01:20:01,634
Are Mikey and Danny
really dead?

906
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,767
I don't know.

907
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:08,634
Are we dead?

908
01:20:10,032 --> 01:20:11,234
Negative.

909
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:14,567
We're good, right?

910
01:20:14,734 --> 01:20:15,734
Fuck, yeah.

911
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:17,701
We're solid.

912
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:26,603
If I die, I need
you to make sure

913
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:30,504
that Cindy knows how
much I love her.

914
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:31,601
She knows.

915
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:34,002
And that I died
with my brothers

916
01:20:35,801 --> 01:20:37,636
with a full fucking heart.

917
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:44,202
You're not dying, Axe.
We're not gonna...

918
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,803
We gotta spread out. Get
yourself some real estate.

919
01:20:57,168 --> 01:20:58,402
64, be advised.

920
01:20:58,468 --> 01:21:01,871
Negative Apache support.
LZ is too hot. Stand down.

921
01:21:01,935 --> 01:21:03,002
What's the problem?

922
01:21:03,101 --> 01:21:05,437
The Apaches were pulled.
We're grounded.

923
01:21:05,502 --> 01:21:06,536
Why?

924
01:21:06,602 --> 01:21:08,270
Some Army troops in contact.

925
01:21:08,335 --> 01:21:09,936
They took our gunship support.

926
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:12,604
Can you put us on the
ground without the Apaches?

927
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:13,970
We'll do what we have
to do to get you

928
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,203
on the ground with your men.

929
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:16,903
Thank you.

930
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:20,339
Bruno 65, continue
030, we're still a go.

931
01:21:20,737 --> 01:21:21,903
Roger, 65.

932
01:21:21,969 --> 01:21:23,136
We're on our own. Stay tight.

933
01:21:25,335 --> 01:21:26,604
Axe?

934
01:21:35,336 --> 01:21:36,604
Axe?

935
01:21:55,638 --> 01:21:56,904
Commander, we're two Mikes out.

936
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:58,649
Get your men ready. Uh-huh.
Uh, Roger that.

937
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:00,673
Two Mikes! Two Mikes!

938
01:22:02,037 --> 01:22:03,372
Marcus!

939
01:22:03,837 --> 01:22:05,172
Marcus!

940
01:22:20,005 --> 01:22:21,239
Yeah!

941
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,973
Bruno 64, two Mikes out. Go!

942
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,407
Gonna be a fast infill.
Establish over watch.

943
01:22:30,838 --> 01:22:32,408
Rope deployed and
on the ground.

944
01:22:32,473 --> 01:22:33,940
Whoo! Axe!

945
01:22:37,905 --> 01:22:39,072
Fast infill now.

946
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,510
Let's do this! Patton!
You're first! Move!

947
01:22:42,573 --> 01:22:43,773
First team member on the rope.

948
01:22:46,473 --> 01:22:47,574
You good?

949
01:22:47,806 --> 01:22:49,440
Couldn't be more good!

950
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:54,974
RPG! Fuck!

951
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,408
No.

952
01:23:03,574 --> 01:23:05,509
Fuck, throttle's off
throttle's off!

953
01:23:05,574 --> 01:23:07,509
Oh, shit, throttle's off!

954
01:23:07,574 --> 01:23:10,143
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!

955
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:18,241
Fucking down!

956
01:23:18,308 --> 01:23:20,676
Mayday, mayday!
Bruno 64 is down.

957
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:22,243
Duck!

958
01:23:23,907 --> 01:23:25,908
Put us down! Put
us the fuck down!

959
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:29,775
Put this fucking
helicopter down!

960
01:23:29,841 --> 01:23:31,210
Stand the fuck
down, Lieutenant.

961
01:23:32,075 --> 01:23:33,142
Wait!

962
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:36,676
Don't you fucking stop!
Come on!

963
01:23:36,742 --> 01:23:38,910
Stand down, Lieutenant.
We're not going down there.

964
01:23:38,975 --> 01:23:40,377
Keep fucking firing!

965
01:23:40,443 --> 01:23:41,676
We have a fallen angel.

966
01:23:41,742 --> 01:23:44,178
64 is down hard.
Broke up on impact.

967
01:23:44,243 --> 01:23:46,111
LZ is too hot. We have
to break contact.

968
01:23:48,076 --> 01:23:49,243
No...

969
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:53,112
No, no, fucking no.

970
01:23:53,342 --> 01:23:54,577
Ah!

971
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:30,353
Razor 11 en route to crash site,
five Mikes out, rejoining QRF.

972
01:26:30,683 --> 01:26:33,685
06 copy, five Mikes out. Be
advised, AO is still hot.

973
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:40,484
Axe?

974
01:26:44,483 --> 01:26:45,952
Oh, my God.

975
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,852
Fuck! Axe?

976
01:26:55,184 --> 01:26:56,518
Fuck.

977
01:27:47,786 --> 01:27:49,521
You see any movement?

978
01:27:49,954 --> 01:27:51,355
I got nothing.

979
01:27:52,187 --> 01:27:56,357
O6, 11. Infrared negative.
Movement negative.

980
01:27:56,687 --> 01:27:58,355
Copy all, 11.

981
01:27:58,687 --> 01:28:02,524
06, we just hit fuel reserve.
We need to come off-station.

982
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:04,522
11 returning to base.

983
01:28:04,853 --> 01:28:06,356
Roger. Copy all.

984
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,725
Oh, fuck.

985
01:30:03,859 --> 01:30:05,127
Fuck.

986
01:31:13,896 --> 01:31:15,097
Fuck.

987
01:32:35,799 --> 01:32:38,068
No. No.

988
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,634
Stay back! Stay the fuck back!

989
01:32:42,299 --> 01:32:43,299
Back up!

990
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:45,100
Stay back.

991
01:32:47,533 --> 01:32:49,368
I don't care. I fucking...

992
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:05,269
What the fuck is this?
Oh, fuck.

993
01:33:08,668 --> 01:33:10,301
I got this.

994
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:53,872
No. No. No.

995
01:34:17,337 --> 01:34:18,337
What?

996
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:23,205
You... You know where
to find Americans?

997
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:24,905
America-yee.

998
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:32,105
Show... Show me where we are.

999
01:34:39,705 --> 01:34:40,772
Are you sure? Yes.

1000
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:54,172
Who's that?

1001
01:34:56,939 --> 01:34:59,106
Who's that? Who is that?

1002
01:34:59,172 --> 01:35:01,542
Who is that? Who is that?
Who is that?

1003
01:35:01,606 --> 01:35:04,642
You see? Do you see what I have?
I'll fucking kill you!

1004
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:06,005
I will fucking kill you!

1005
01:35:06,273 --> 01:35:08,351
Is he... Is he Taliban? Is
he Taliban? Is he Taliban?

1006
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:12,757
I will fucking kill you. I will
fucking kill you right now.

1007
01:35:14,807 --> 01:35:16,340
I know he fucking
knows something.

1008
01:35:16,406 --> 01:35:18,975
You tell him I will
fucking kill him.

1009
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,940
Look at me in my fucking eyes

1010
01:35:21,006 --> 01:35:23,542
and you ask me if you
think I give a fuck!

1011
01:35:23,607 --> 01:35:25,941
I don't care. I don't go
home, you don't go home.

1012
01:35:26,006 --> 01:35:27,040
You hear me?

1013
01:35:27,106 --> 01:35:29,108
I fucking kill you!
I kill you.

1014
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:35,009
Why do you help me?
Why do you help me?

1015
01:35:35,407 --> 01:35:36,574
Do you help me?

1016
01:35:38,274 --> 01:35:39,475
Yes. Can I trust you?

1017
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,875
America-yee.

1018
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:43,708
Okay.

1019
01:35:45,107 --> 01:35:46,241
Okay.

1020
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:50,844
There's an American base located
here. Give this to them.

1021
01:35:51,308 --> 01:35:53,109
Tell them where I am.
Tell them where I am.

1022
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:54,509
America-yee. Okay?

1023
01:37:23,512 --> 01:37:26,815
No! No, no! No! Get
the fuck off me!

1024
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:33,048
No! No! Fuck, no!

1025
01:37:39,379 --> 01:37:40,414
Fuck you!

1026
01:37:40,546 --> 01:37:41,780
Fuck you, America!

1027
01:37:42,646 --> 01:37:43,812
Cry, motherfucker!

1028
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,882
Fucking do it! Fucking
do it, you fuck! Huh?

1029
01:37:47,813 --> 01:37:49,147
Fuck!

1030
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,548
Fuck! Fuck!

1031
01:37:51,647 --> 01:37:54,583
I'm gonna cut your head off and
send it to your fucking American...

1032
01:37:57,913 --> 01:37:58,947
Yeah, fuck you!

1033
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,718
Why are you doing this for me?

1034
01:38:52,049 --> 01:38:54,017
Fuck Taliban. Fuck Taliban.

1035
01:39:04,617 --> 01:39:06,585
I need a knife.

1036
01:39:08,983 --> 01:39:10,418
A knife. Cut.

1037
01:39:10,783 --> 01:39:11,951
Knife.

1038
01:39:12,617 --> 01:39:14,418
You know, knife? Cut.

1039
01:39:15,317 --> 01:39:17,318
Okay? Go get a knife.

1040
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:18,584
Knife.

1041
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:22,588
Yes! Yes, a knife, to cut.
Okay? Go.

1042
01:39:23,117 --> 01:39:25,953
Go get me a knife.
Please? Please.

1043
01:39:45,051 --> 01:39:47,354
No, I... I said a knife.
That's not a knife.

1044
01:39:48,018 --> 01:39:49,119
Knife.

1045
01:39:49,385 --> 01:39:51,954
No. It's not a knife.
It's a fucking duck!

1046
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:55,955
I need a knife. You know, knife?
To cut.

1047
01:39:56,219 --> 01:39:57,420
Knife.

1048
01:39:58,152 --> 01:39:59,486
That's not...

1049
01:39:59,685 --> 01:40:00,853
I need a knife.

1050
01:40:01,885 --> 01:40:03,654
A knife... You know, a knife?

1051
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:04,920
Chaku.

1052
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:12,288
Chaku?

1053
01:40:13,019 --> 01:40:15,055
Yes! Yes! Knife, yes!

1054
01:40:16,353 --> 01:40:17,620
No, no! No, no, no, no!

1055
01:40:18,153 --> 01:40:19,753
For my leg. Please.

1056
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,788
Give me the knife, for my leg.

1057
01:40:39,521 --> 01:40:40,721
Fuck.

1058
01:44:27,698 --> 01:44:29,032
America-yee?

1059
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:32,165
Texas.

1060
01:44:32,764 --> 01:44:34,165
America-yee?

1061
01:44:35,164 --> 01:44:37,333
Yes, Texas. America
is Texas, yes.

1062
01:44:37,798 --> 01:44:38,798
Tex.

1063
01:44:39,999 --> 01:44:41,266
Texas.

1064
01:44:41,664 --> 01:44:43,333
Texas.

1065
01:44:54,999 --> 01:44:56,267
Why are you doing this for me?

1066
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:11,101
Sir, we have a verified letter

1067
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:12,366
from Marcus Luttrell
seeking assistance.

I want all available CSAR up in the
air and moving on this right now.

01:45:24,366 --> 01:45:25,935
Put me everything in the air.
Yes, sir.

1072
01:45:26,001 --> 01:45:27,401
Gentlemen, keep your lines free. Those
guys are busy at the other end.

1073
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,300
All non-essential personnel,

Tallying multiple hostiles.
Are we clear to engage?

1079
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:59,976
Razor 12, you are
clear to engage.

1080
01:48:23,308 --> 01:48:25,543
Contact right! Contact right!

1081
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:27,009
Two on the le Ft!

1082
01:48:28,975 --> 01:48:30,308
We're clear right!

1083
01:48:30,542 --> 01:48:32,877
Halo 4-1. Visual red smoke.

1084
01:48:37,542 --> 01:48:39,877
Halo 4-2, you are
cleared for the zone.

1085
01:48:40,209 --> 01:48:42,811
Halo 4-2. Established low block.
On approach.

1086
01:48:44,442 --> 01:48:45,911
Ninety feet, 45 knots.

1087
01:48:46,342 --> 01:48:48,111
Clear forward. Down right.

1088
01:48:48,175 --> 01:48:49,810
Clear to the LZ.

1089
01:48:57,609 --> 01:48:58,610
Let's go. Move.

1090
01:48:59,543 --> 01:49:00,810
Go. Go, go, go, go.

1091
01:49:00,876 --> 01:49:02,043
There's an American!
In the door!

1092
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:03,244
What do you see?
What do you see?

1093
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:04,878
Any Americans?

1094
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:07,111
American? This way?

1095
01:49:07,176 --> 01:49:08,477
Go, go, right!

1096
01:49:12,044 --> 01:49:13,078
Go!

1097
01:49:13,877 --> 01:49:15,210
Let me see your hands!

1098
01:49:17,044 --> 01:49:18,545
Are you Marcus Luttrell?

1099
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:21,178
You're safe, Marcus.
You're going home.

1100
01:49:21,311 --> 01:49:22,345
Coming out!

1101
01:49:22,477 --> 01:49:24,846
Outside, walking him
out, coming outside.

1102
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:26,245
Here we go, all right, Marcus.

1103
01:49:27,211 --> 01:49:28,880
Hey, hey, watch yourself here!
Watch it!

1104
01:49:28,945 --> 01:49:30,211
Come on, we gotta go, we
gotta go. He comes with me.

1105
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:32,146
Sir. That's not going
to happen, sir.

1106
01:49:32,477 --> 01:49:34,378
You can stay here.
You'll be safe.

1107
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:38,214
You can't come with us. These guys
will take care of you. You'll be safe.

1108
01:49:40,545 --> 01:49:41,879
Wait! Wait!

1109
01:49:42,678 --> 01:49:44,646
Thank you. Thank you!

1110
01:49:55,545 --> 01:49:57,413
Let's go, sir. We gotta go now.
Let's move.

1111
01:49:57,478 --> 01:49:59,413
Let's go! I'm sorry, Marcus,
we gotta move. Let's go.

1112
01:49:59,479 --> 01:50:00,479
Thank you.

1113
01:50:01,879 --> 01:50:03,714
Let's go, we got to go!

1114
01:50:04,546 --> 01:50:07,348
Got him. He'll be fine.
I got you. Thank you.

1115
01:50:07,412 --> 01:50:09,481
Let's go! Let's move,
come on, here we go.

1116
01:50:09,579 --> 01:50:10,913
Come on, we're
wheels up in 30.

1117
01:50:11,014 --> 01:50:13,181
Come on, Marcus. Easy.

1118
01:50:14,947 --> 01:50:16,113
Here we go, Marcus.

1119
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:23,048
Jackpot! Say again, jackpot!
We got him!

1120
01:50:39,815 --> 01:50:42,684
Patient upgraded to urgent
surgical. Prepare units of blood.

1121
01:50:46,748 --> 01:50:49,884
Multiple gunshot wounds
found on secondary survey.

1122
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:56,750
Update ready to follow.
Say when ready to copy.

1123
01:50:59,248 --> 01:51:02,417
Brave men have fought and died
building the proud tradition

1124
01:51:02,481 --> 01:51:05,751
and fear of reputation
that I am bound to uphold.

1125
01:51:14,415 --> 01:51:16,584
I died up on that Mountain.

1126
01:51:18,682 --> 01:51:20,183
No pulse. Okay, start CPR.

1127
01:51:20,249 --> 01:51:21,718
One, two, three...

1128
01:51:22,316 --> 01:51:24,518
There is no question

1129
01:51:24,582 --> 01:51:27,919
a part of me will forever be
up on that Mountain, dead...

1130
01:51:28,115 --> 01:51:30,051
As my brothers died.

1131
01:51:31,216 --> 01:51:34,986
But there is a part of me that
lived because of my brothers.

1132
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,918
Because of them, I
am still alive.

1133
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:41,821
And I can never forget that
no matter how much it hurts,

1134
01:51:41,884 --> 01:51:44,952
how dark it gets, or
how far you fall...

1135
01:51:46,583 --> 01:51:48,719
Hey, Luttrell. Luttrell!

1136
01:51:55,851 --> 01:51:57,319
We got a pulse.

1137
01:51:57,584 --> 01:52:00,086
...you are never
out of the fight.
