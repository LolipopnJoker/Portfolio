00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:43,541
Get off the babysitter.
Daddy's home.

4
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:24,530
What is an Angel doing
so far from Heaven?

5
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:34,166
l'm no Angel.

6
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,197
This is hostel, yeah?

Ray Carter
U.S. Marshal

00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:47,839
Marshal Ray Carter? l'm Alex Munday.

10
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:51,173
l didn't think you'd find me.
How many men do you have?

11
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:53,466
l've got two girlfriends in the bar.

12
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,261
They have 50 armed men.

13
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,715
l know. lt hardly seems fair.
Come on.

14
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,266
-What is it?
-My ribs.

15
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,810
Dylan? Dylan,
we need to get out of here.

16
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:08,476
l'm on top of it.

17
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:23,365
-They got my ring.
-l'm sure your wife will understand.

18
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:38,842
Kill them!

19
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,006
Kill them all!

20
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:26,712
Plan B.

21
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,445
Just once, l'd like to walk out of a bar.

22
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,181
Let's go!

23
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:32,234

Dylan!

26
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:09,137

Yeah.

30
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:27,823
That happens a lot.

31
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:53,685
lt was three girls!

32
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,600
Three crazy beautiful girls.

33
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:56,855
But we have the ring.

34
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:59,899
l always knew this day would come...

35
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,777
Let's go to plan B.

36
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:10,163
Once upon a time, there were three
very different little girls.

37
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:26,929
Come on, Alex. This is the last pass.
You can do it!

38
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,680
Come on, Alex. This is the last pass.
You can do it!

39
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:34,299
Harder! Harder! Harder!

40
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:55,071
l want you! l want you now!

41
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:59,244
who grew up to be three
very different women.

42
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,282
No.

43
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,638
Okay.

44
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,946
You, hot water.

45
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,116
Here it goes. Here it goes.

46
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,321
There we go.

47
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:48,042
Now they work for me.
My name is Charlie.

We're ready for takeoff.

50
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,143
Well done, Agent McDowell.

51
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:01,178
Hey, check this out.

52
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:04,305
Our first piece of mail.

53
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:15,603

-lt'll be a fun night, Nat.

54
00:14:15,777 --> 00:14:18,149
-lsn't that cool?
-lt's great.

55
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:22,989
l still can't believe Nat and Pete
are moving in together.

56
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,741
-Our little Angel's growing up.
-lt's wild that Natalie owns property.

57
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,237
The most expensive thing l own
are these boots.

58
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:32,664
-Excuse me. Those are my boots.
-Whatever. My point is--

59
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:38,787
l forgot my point.

60
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,171
You're broke, horny
and wearing my boots.

61
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,251
Thank you.

62
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:51,174
So you thought you could escape
my fortress.

63
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,976
Not so fast.

64
00:14:56,982 --> 00:15:00,599
-Oh, my God! Jason.
-Surprise.

65
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,861
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

66
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,690
That was fun.

67
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,691
Fun. Yeah.

68
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:13,327
-What are you doing here?
-l miss you. Look--

69
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,874
What are you doing later, after this?
Later on?

70
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,004
Jason, l thought we were
on a time-out.

71
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,210
What? We can't fool around at all?

72
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,719
Hey, Jason.
l didn't think you'd make it.

73
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,968
Yeah, the photo shoot ran late. Plus,
l wanted to miss all the heavy stuff.

74
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:38,051
-Hey, Jason.
-Hey.

75
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,185
-How's the sequel going?
-Great.

76
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:43,558
We had, like, 1 3 writers,
so it should be pretty good.

77
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,603
-l loved the first one.
-Yeah, it was great.

78
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:52,819
Sorry. We got a great title for this
one: Maximum Extreme-2.

79
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,865
The premiere's Friday,
so l brought you tickets.

80
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,409

Charlie.

86
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,674
Bosley!

87
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:22,554
What's happening, Angels?
How y'all doing?

88
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:23,931
-Hey.
-Hey, Bos.

89
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:27,602
Look here. l see my brother
ain't checked the books in a while.

90
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:28,936
We have a book?

91
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:33,188
Look here, lovelies, l only been here
a few days, but will you explain...

92
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,820
...what the hell is this?

93
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,067
Now, what--?

94
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,568
Careful with that, Bos.

95
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,739
l'm all right.

96
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,414
And l also see y'all being played.
Five G's for a Kevlar vest?

97
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,418
-We need those.
-They're made especially for us.

98
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:53,622
What? You all fine, but you crazy.

99
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,212
What?

100
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,962
Bosley, come here.

101
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,964
-Have a seat, Bos.
-Okay.

102
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,418
-Bos.
-What?

103
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,056
B.

104
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:08,515
Your brother didn't sweat the details.

105
00:17:08,686 --> 00:17:10,974
-We do what it takes.
-Right.

106
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:13,139
So, what does a Bosley do
around here?

107
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:17,313
-He does the most important job of all.
-What's that?

108
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:20,320
He connects us with Charlie.

109
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:25,525
Okay. All right. All right.

110
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,406
-Good morning, Angels.
-Good morning, Charlie.

111
00:17:28,579 --> 00:17:31,829
Bosley, I hope the Angels
aren't being too rough on you.

112
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:35,948
Man, please. l date fat women.
What are you talking about?

113
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:39,084
Great work in Mongolia, Angels...

114
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,754
...but I'm afraid the case
has tak en a new turn.

115
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:45,297
Goddamn! What the f--?
Look-- Look--

116
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:51,013
l know where l'm watching
the game at tonight. Look at that.

117
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:55,394
Angels, I'd lik e to introduce Roger
wixon, senior director of the FBI.

118
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,186
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure.

119
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:58,684
-Hi.
-Hello.

120
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,896
Over the years,
the Townsend Agency...

121
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,225
...has work ed on projects
for the bureau...

122
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:07,269
...but never one with so many
innocent lives at stak e.

123
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:11,030
Hey, l'm busy watching
that doggone screen.

124
00:18:11,201 --> 00:18:12,826
Good job, Bos.

125
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:17,821
Angels, you're aware of the Federal
witness Protection Program.

126
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:20,241
People who testify
against major crime figures...

127
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:22,660
...are relocated
and given new identities.

128
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:23,713
The identities of these witnesses are
protected by a program called HALO.:

129
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:27,212
The identities of these witnesses are
protected by a program called HALO.:

130
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:29,589
Hidden Alias List Operation.

131
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,045
The list is encrypted
on two titanium rings.

132
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:36,305
The data on each ring is
indecipherable on its own...

133
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:40,554
...but when they are read together,
their codes unlock each other.

134
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,009
Who wears the rings?

135
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,857
The head of the U.S. Marshal Service
was wearing one.

136
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,933
-Ray Carter.
-Good morning.

137
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:50,893
-Hey, how are you feeling?
-Couple of fractured ribs, but I'll live.

138
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:52,399
Who wears the other ring?

139
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:56,190
The head of security for the Justice
Department, william Rose Bailey.

140
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,740
Unfortunately, he was killed
this morning.

141
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,996
-Now both rings are in the open.
-So the list is out.

142
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:04,240
Someone's contacted the major
crime families offering to sell the list.

143
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:04,997
Antonioni Crime Family

144
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,246

O'Grady Clan

147
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,879
One of our protected witness,
Alan Caufield...

148
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,915
... was found dead at home
in the Valley.

149
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,381
Angels, we need to get the HALO
rings back before the list is sold.

150
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:20,922
-We'll start at the Caufield house.
-See if that leads us to HALO.

151
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:25,428
Hey, Charlie, we could really use
Bosley's help on this one.

152
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:28,094
-Get to drive the racecar?
-Not today.

153
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,229
-Blow up a castle?
-Not yet, Bos.

154
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:32,475
Well, what do y'all need me to do?

155
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:37,102
-Read some body language.
-Hell, yeah.

l'm not going nowhere near
no dead body.

161
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,810
Freeze, ladies. lf you're not a dead
body, other side of the ropes.

162
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,102
We got a serious situation here.
My men have the area secure.

163
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:21,483
l have to ask you
to evacuate immediately.

164
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:27,407
We got a 21 1 , a 1 83, believe it or not,
we got an 1 1 -350, and it ain't pretty.

165
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:27,952
An 1 1 -350? You found an illegal
chinchilla ranch on the premises?

166
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:31,735
An 1 1 -350? You found an illegal
chinchilla ranch on the premises?

167
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,369
lt's a chinchilla farm.

168
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,290
But you're good.

169
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:38,666
Negatory to orders
to relinquish locality.

170
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,829
Circumspect to your observation...

171
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:45,003
...we'll proceed to the interior of the
dwelling with your accompaniment.

172
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:50,133
Well, l do not copy. Repeat, do not
copy. l'll have to ask my sergeant.

173
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:52,677
Your sergeant is here.

174
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,777
Hands off.

175
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:17,198
lf you had your game faces on at the
academy, you ought to figure this out.

176
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:18,998
Simple café coronary.
Freak show choked to death.

177
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,240
Simple café coronary.
Freak show choked to death.

178
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:22,995
Questions?

179
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:27,376
Examination of soft palate reveals
porcine byproduct...

180
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:29,208
...lodged in vestibule.

181
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,885
Okay, let's do this. Come on, baby.

182
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:36,089
Caufield shows no signs
of trauma to the larynx.

183
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,885
His struggle pattern indicates
that he didn't choke.

184
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:42,382
He was smothered.

185
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,052
Ladies, we got some
carnauba residue.

186
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:47,022
Pineapple.

187
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:50,310
Oh, it's Sex Wax. Best for your stick.

188
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:51,730
Pardon me?

189
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,979
-The killer's a surfer.
-How do you know?

190
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:57,275
He used the credit card he uses
to scrape wax off his board...

191
00:21:58,243 --> 00:22:00,034
...to gain entry into the house.

192
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:02,491
Thrasher scumbag surfers.

193
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:04,573
Freeze!

194
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:10,124
l found a foreign print. He was wearing
reissued 1 989 Air Jordans.

195
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,169
A limited promotional version sold...

196
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:15,589
...only at the Foot Locker
in Fontana, in the summer of 2002.

197
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:18,923
There's a discrepancy
in weight distribution...

198
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:21,930
...between the left and right sides.

199
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:26,759
An anterior cruciate ligament
that was repaired in the last year.

200
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:29,259
All right, who did it?

201
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:31,596
A killer with a scar on his knee
who surfs.

202
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:32,805
Did he stink?

203
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:36,601
There's a hurricane off Baja. That
means good swells for south beaches.

204
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:38,058
Was there a lot of blood?

205
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:41,191
Offshore winds, Third Point.
Malibu's pumping.

206
00:22:41,366 --> 00:22:45,363
-Alex, surfboards are at your house.
-Share it with me, Angels.

207
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:47,610
Freeze!

208
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:51,875
Daddy? Daddy!

209
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,832
Daddy? Daddy!

210
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:58,130
Darling! l was meeting your mother
in Bali, and they cancelled the flight.

211
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:02,959
Some sort of monsoon.
So how is my favourite little ferret?

212
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:05,463
Do the face.

213
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:09,213
No, come on. Do it properly.

214
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:17,312
That is so cute.
l do the whiskers with my dad.

215
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,316
Mr. Munday, it is such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

216
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:23,981
l'm Dylan.

217
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:25,317
That's Natalie.

218
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,945
l assure you,
none of the stories are true.

219
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:30,489
Well, some of them are.

220
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,242
So you work with Alex
at the hospital?

221
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:41,207
Yes! Natalie works
in the psychiatric ward...

222
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,463
...and Dylan is the head
of gynaecology.

223
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,788
Really?

224
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,759
-So young.
-l know.

225
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:54,004
We were just on our way out. We have
a major procedure coming up, so....

226
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,384
-Duty calls. Sorry.
-l've got to prep.

227
00:23:58,561 --> 00:23:59,592
Scrub up.

228
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,146
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

229
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,559
See you in a minute.

230
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,223
lt's just a tiny emergency.
Make yourself at home.

231
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,358
We'll talk later.
Go save lives.

232
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:09,351
Love you.

233
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:14,989
Head of gynaecology?

234
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:28,247
Wait a second.

235
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,165
Bos? There's a waxer on your 6.

236
00:24:32,342 --> 00:24:33,373
ls that you, Lord?

237
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,221
Get in there and see
if he uses pineapple Sex wax.

238
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:38,261
Dylan, check it out.

239
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,970
l got sand in my ass.
l can't hardly walk.

240
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:45,060
Just blend in. Be cool, Bos.

241
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,983
Got any wax?

242
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:56,613
Great job, Bos.

243
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:01,573
ls that grape? lt's grape.

244
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:03,286
lt's grape!

245
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:04,569
Yes, sir!

246
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:06,332
Suspect four eliminated.

247
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,327
Suspect four eliminated.

248
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:12,117
What's up, Angel?

249
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,711
-Madison Lee?
-Natalie Cook?

250
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,130
Oh, my God.

251
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,002
How did you know?

252
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,933
-l get the newsletter.
-Of course.

253
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:31,598
Wow. l've heard so many stories
about you. You're my favourite Angel.

254
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:35,140
She won the Nobel Prize for her
research on flying mammals.

255
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,523
And predicted Carmine DeSoto's
every move...

256
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,982
...by using the Cosmo
Bedside Astrologer.

257
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:46,945
l also set the clock on Charlie's VCR.

258
00:25:47,786 --> 00:25:50,075
And she invented the molar mike.

259
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,952
-Dylan and Alex?
-Yeah.

260
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:59,128
-God, how l miss stakeouts.
-l know. Aren't they the best?

261
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:02,163
Bring it on Bitch!

262
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,217
Only one waxer left.

263
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:07,501
Wait a second.

264
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:10,552
Subpatellar scar, left knee.

265
00:26:10,724 --> 00:26:14,971
Check it out. Brown shorts, red board,
1 1 o'clock. What do you think?

266
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:18,891
-Yummy.
-That's what l thought.

267
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:21,900
Case closed. Nat, move in.
Dylan thinks he's hot.

268
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:23,147
What do you mean?

269
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,940
You always fall for the bad guy.

270
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:29,484
Then this guy must be really evil.

271
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:32,410
You should see the new agency.
lt's beautiful.

272
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:36,409
Maybe l will. Tell Charlie hello
for me when you see him.

273
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:39,661
You know.

274
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,522
There she goes.

275
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:11,065
Who do you think will be
the first of us to leave?

276
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:13,112
You, me or Natalie?

277
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:14,491
-What are you talking about?
-l think it'll be Nat.

278
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:16,199
-What are you talking about?
-l think it'll be Nat.

279
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,027
Why? Did she say something?

280
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,203
Nat and Pete live together now.
Soon they'll be engaged...

281
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:23,530
...and you and l will wear
pink dresses...

282
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,041
...at the wedding
of Mr. and Mrs. Pete Kominsky.

283
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,168
Yeah, but even if she got married,
she'd never leave us.

284
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:36,338
Sooner or later, you and l are gonna
have to break in a new Angel.

285
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,346
Good morning, Angels.

286
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:42,970
Good morning, Charlie.

287
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,853
-Good morning, Angels.
-Good morning, Charlie.

288
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:48,059
-Good morning, Angels.
-Good morning, Charlie.

289
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,024
Good morning, Angels.

290
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,067
Good morning, Charlie.

291
00:27:57,655 --> 00:28:00,111
Good morning, Charlie.

292
00:28:03,744 --> 00:28:07,872
l mean, you didn't think it would be
the three of us forever, did you?

293
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:11,373
l think l lost my nuts.
Your nuts ever get small?

294
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:15,920
When l get in water, they just shrink
up. They become like one marble.

295
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:31,102
Killer, huh?

296
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:33,099
l just got so excited.

297
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,106
When it's big like that,
l love to ride it hard and rough.

298
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:38,848
Sorry.

299
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:43,226
The way l was getting pounded,
l'm gonna be wet for hours.

300
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,792
Catch you later.

301
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,831

00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:24,143
This is it.

305
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:26,145
The Coal Bowl.

306
00:29:26,737 --> 00:29:28,564

-l'll buy in.
-l'll find Leo.

308
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:45,457
l'll look for Emmers.

309
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,752
-l'll look for Emmers.
-Yeah.

310
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:53,966
All right, Leo, you're mine.

311
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:55,597
Good luck.

312
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:56,759
Good luck.

313
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,429
-You in charge here?
-You know it.

314
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:00,435
-l want in.
-lt's a two-G buy-in. Winner takes all.

315
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:03,388
-l want in.
-lt's a two-G buy-in. Winner takes all.

316
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:06,931
-Rules are, there are no rules.
-l'm down.

317
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:10,182
Three out of four
don't cross the finish line.

318
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,852
l'll take those odds.

319
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:18,901
Hey, how's it going?

320
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:22,327
-Metzger's at the far double.
-ls this your first time--?

321
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:24,655
Carmichael's at the finish line.

322
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:26,990
l was thinking may--

323
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:50,386
You and Pete moving in together
is a big deal.

324
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:54,348
-Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
-So where do you see this going?

325
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:57,064
Going? l'm confused.

326
00:30:57,237 --> 00:31:00,154
Okay, say someone was
to come up to me and say:

327
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:03,822
' Hey, Dylan, do you think
Natalie wants to get married?'

328
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,320
What? Did Pete ask you to ask me
if l wanted to get married?

329
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:11,740
-No.
-Because we just moved in together.

330
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,040
Heads up, l've spotted Emmers.
l'm on him.

331
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:16,412
Red bike, red helmet.

332
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:40,433
Nat, number 25. Check it out.

333
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,144
The lion. That's Leo.

334
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,280
l got it. The guy in blue.

335
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,876
l got shut out.

336
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,459
-What was that?
-He's after Leo.

337
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,470
He just took out a guy
in the front double.

338
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,111
-He's making his way up to Leo.
-l'm gonna get him.

339
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:41,491
That's it! Let's get in there.

340
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:02,974

341
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:09,978
-He's gonna crush him!
-Look out, Nat!

342
00:33:11,443 --> 00:33:13,685
What the hell are you doing?!

343
00:33:16,615 --> 00:33:18,322
Nat, he's on your 6.

344
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,450
No, Natalie!

345
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:30,327
-Natalie!
-l'm okay.

346
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:35,544
We gotta take him out!

347
00:33:43,097 --> 00:33:44,556
l'll get back in.

348
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,978
Let's go!

349
00:33:58,153 --> 00:33:59,397
Get him at the double.

350
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,103
-You okay?
-Yeah.

351
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:50,236
Hey, what are you doing with my bike?

352
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:22,600
Dylan!

353
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:49,958
The Thin Man.

354
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:01,716
He's dead.

355
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:06,184
-What the hell is going on?
-Hey, you're just a kid.

356
00:36:06,353 --> 00:36:08,145
l'm 1 5 and a half.

357
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:10,769
Photos. Alan Caufield.

358
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:14,560
-Max Petroni.
-How'd you know my real name?

359
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:17,317
What the hell's this?

360
00:36:17,614 --> 00:36:20,614
Hey, this is a picture of Dylan.

361
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:23,742
The name on the back
is Helen Zaas.

362
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:30,700
Helen Zaas.

363
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:33,704
My name
before l went into...

364
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:36,370
...the Witness Protection Program
8 years ago.

365
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,671
And then l became Dylan Sanders.

366
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:41,379
when the FBI realized
the young lady's potential...

367
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:43,214
... they gave me a call.

368
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:46,222
-Okay, wait. Helen Zaas?
-Yeah.

369
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,765
-That's your name?
-Yeah.

370
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:49,724
Helen Zaas.

371
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:55,889
So where does that name come
from originally? ls that Ass-tralian?

372
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:58,725
Yeah.

373
00:36:58,902 --> 00:37:01,902
Oh, my God, you must have been
the butt of every joke.

374
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:06,199
-Did you drive an Aston Martin?
-Alex, we're being asinine.

375
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,909
Yes, you are.

376
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:11,243
Don't worry, Dylan. We're still
gonna be your best butties.

377
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,908
Now, Angels, a rose by any
other name still smells as sweet.

378
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,327
Thank you, Charlie.
lt's not that funny.

379
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,618
Yeah, it is.

380
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:23,584
-Bos, can l get a ruling on this one?
-You sure can.

381
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:28,087
You know what? Personally,
l'm not interested in Helen Zaas.

382
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:30,005
l'm more concerned about yours.

383
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,264
No matter what,
you're still gonna be our Dylan.

384
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,260
-Thank you, Bos.
-You're welcome.

385
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:38,804
Let me guess,
you fell for the bad guy.

386
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,518
l fell for the worst guy.

387
00:37:41,691 --> 00:37:43,932
But he was so cute,
and l liked him so much.

388
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,687
We had so much fun together...

389
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:48,732
...just driving around,
listening to metal and....

390
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,563
8 years ago

391
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:03,784
And then one night,
things got really bad.

392
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:14,298
l love you!
l would die for you, Seamus!

393
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:16,881
O'Grady.

394
00:38:18,183 --> 00:38:19,926
You got some balls.

395
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,278
He said he'd kill me if l told anyone,
but l had to put him away.

396
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:35,565
-Of course you did.
-You did the right thing.

397
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:38,781
-He was my first.
-Really?

398
00:38:38,952 --> 00:38:42,819
-But you told me you never did it.
-My first bust.

399
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:45,488
-Yeah.
-Who was this guy?

400
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:51,200
-Seamus O'Grady.
-O'Grady?

401
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,630
-As in the lrish mob?
-l sent him to prison.

402
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:00,257
Right now

403
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,268
O'Grady.

404
00:39:11,106 --> 00:39:12,351
You're out.

405
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,563
O'Grady, what about your belongings?

406
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:37,713
So if l have these, she'll find me?

407
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:44,796
-The O'Gradys killed my parents.
-What?

408
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:47,007
Sorry, Max.

409
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:49,637
l testified against them.

410
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:55,016
Wait a second. Alan Caufield.
He testified against the O'Gradys.

411
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:58,391
That's it. The O'Gradys must have
HALO. This is our one lead.

412
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,642
The Thin Man.

413
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:03,570
-Our favourite assassin.
-That's right.

414
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:07,403
-This needs to go get analysed.
-Yes, let's get up in there and do that.

415
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,199
Let me see it.

416
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,444
Yeah, l know exactly what this is.
l have one.

417
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,497
The nuns gave it to us
at the orphanage.

418
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,493
Orphanage.

419
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:22,416
-Good work.
-Max is in our protective custody now.

420
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:27,546
-It's up to us to k eep him safe.
-Hey, l know the safest place in town.

421
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,855
Listen, don't you worry about a thing.

422
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,110
No O'Grady ever set foot
in South Central. Can you dig it?

423
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,773
-Yeah.
-This is my mama house.

424
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,734
Rule number one: Don't look
her in the eye. Understand?

425
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,616
Or she'll pop. Can you dig it?

426
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,784
-Bosley.
-Yes, ma'am?

427
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,495
You get over here.

428
00:40:58,663 --> 00:40:59,861
Hey, Mama.

429
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,538
-What kind of trouble you in now?
-l'm not in any trou-- Yes, ma'am.

430
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:04,954
-Come on.
-Yes, ma'am.

431
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,346
-Look at those knockers.
-Boys!

432
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:31,818
Mother superior will see you now.

433
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,397
Mother, do you recognize this man?

434
00:41:38,575 --> 00:41:40,651
Of course l know who he is.

435
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:44,077
We called him Anthony,
after St. Anthony of Padua...

436
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:48,244
...healer of the mute.
Please come forward.

437
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,541
Please, girls.

438
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,803
But his real name, like so much
about him, was a mystery.

439
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:08,134
He came to us when he was 7.

440
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:13,098
He was found wandering in the hills,
living off roots and insects.

441
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,518
w e believe his family was in
a Romanian circus troupe...

442
00:42:16,985 --> 00:42:19,654
... who died in a terrible fire.

443
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:22,857
Although the doctors could find
nothing physically wrong...

444
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:24,989
...he never spok e a word.

445
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:29,370
And there were other idiosyncrasies.
He was a painfully shy child...

446
00:42:29,538 --> 00:42:29,788
... until it came time
for his monthly haircut.

447
00:42:29,788 --> 00:42:33,868
... until it came time
for his monthly haircut.

448
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,502
Then one morning,
he was simply gone.

449
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:49,509
The Thin Man was protecting Max.

450
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:54,551
So you're saying this man is the sole
benefactor of your orphanage?

451
00:42:54,728 --> 00:42:58,310
Yes, he really is an angel.

452
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:03,183
Mother, have you had
contact with him since?

453
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,318
Well, not really that much...

454
00:43:05,488 --> 00:43:07,895
...except for the odd haircut
now and then.

455
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:17,076
But he does send gifts.
Like this morning.

456
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,657
-Emmers' car.
-That is a nice ride.

457
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:25,580
An original 1 967
numbers-matching GTO.

458
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:32,918
-Thorn Birds.
-l know.

459
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:37,051
Bird poo.

460
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:40,724
What order did you girls
say you were from again?

461
00:43:40,895 --> 00:43:43,564
-Larus californicus.
-California gull.

462
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:46,020
Fecal matter consists mostly
of scaly clypeiform.

463
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:48,943
Sardines that fed
on large brown algae, l'd say.

464
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:52,562
There's also traces of tanker fuel
and storm-water runoff as well.

465
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:55,693
Sea gulls, tankers, storm water.

466
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,275
San Pedro Harbour.

467
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,969
-Who are you?
-What?! Wait.

468
00:44:19,472 --> 00:44:20,752
-What?
-Who are you?

469
00:44:20,932 --> 00:44:23,423
Oh, Jason Gibbons.

470
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:26,059
The actor.

471
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:29,385
Maybe you've seen
Maximum Extreme.

472
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:31,059
No.

473
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:33,806
-lt was such a big movie.
-What are you doing here?

474
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:37,188
-l'm Alex's boyfriend.
-Alex's boyfriend.

475
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:40,448
Yeah. Well, technically,
we're on what she calls a time-out.

476
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:44,493
-What does that mean?
-Exactly. Thank you.

477
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:49,573
Yeah. l gotta say, you must be
the world's most understanding father.

478
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,669
-Why?
-All the wild stuff she does.

479
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:56,335
When l first met Alex,
l thought she was a bikini waxer.

480
00:44:57,507 --> 00:44:59,749
lt was months before
l knew about Charlie.

481
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:02,469
Who's Charlie?

482
00:45:02,637 --> 00:45:06,171
San Pedro Harbour

483
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,900
Merkin.

484
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:25,107
That was the name
of Seamus' pit bull.

485
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:31,656
Armed guards.
Security looks pretty tight.

486
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,403
This dock is like a fortress.

487
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:37,702
lD badges.
l think cargo's our best bet.

488
00:45:37,877 --> 00:45:40,629
-Townsend Agency.
-Bos, recon incoming.

489
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:43,750
-Got you, baby.
-Yeah, check the photo.

490
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,052
That's our man.

491
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:55,515
The Treasure Chest.

492
00:45:56,436 --> 00:45:59,472
-Do a little dance.
-Make a little love.

493
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:02,474
Get down tonight.

494
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,392
-There he is, first table on the right.
-Yeah, baby!

495
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:41,764
-There he is, first table on the right.
-Yeah, baby!

496
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:47,293
Hold.

497
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:02,144
-Paddy O'Malley?
-Top of the morning to you.

498
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:07,060
You know, you just don't look much
like any Paddy l've ever seen before.

499
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,443
Ain't never heard
of no black lrish?

500
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,155
-Black lrish?
-That's right.

501
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,324
Who do you think invented
the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh?

502
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,612
-Shamrock Shake? That's ours.
-Give me your papers.

503
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:19,578
-What?
-Your papers.

504
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:21,409
Let me tell you...

505
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:24,073
...you got nerve to ask me
about my papers.

506
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,577
My family suffered, man,
for lack of potatoes.

507
00:49:26,754 --> 00:49:29,671
Foot-and-mouth disease.
Canker sores. Circumcision.

508
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,757
-Circumcision?
-Right, my wife just had a set of twins.

509
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:34,669
-Both leprechauns.
-Leprechauns?

510
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:37,631
Get a whiff.
lrish Spring.

511
00:49:37,806 --> 00:49:40,925
You don't believe that,
wipe your ass with a four-leaf clover.

512
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,140
McGinty!

513
00:49:43,311 --> 00:49:44,935
Get this stuff on the ship.

514
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,524
-Tough, eh?
-That was heavy.

515
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:06,492
l say we should take a break.

516
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:24,382
Wait a second.

517
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,970
l smell a rat.

518
00:51:03,342 --> 00:51:05,798
This ring is pure platinum.

519
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,630
The HALO rings are titanium.

520
00:51:08,138 --> 00:51:10,214
HALO data chips
should be weightless...

521
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,174
...surrounded by a hollow core
that prevents thermal induction.

522
00:51:14,352 --> 00:51:16,677
lf the density of the object...

523
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:22,145
...is less than that of the substance
in which it is immersed....

524
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,315
lt floats.

525
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:31,864
There they are.

526
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:40,865
l'm sure Helen Zaas was great,
but l just can't imagine life...

527
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:43,831
...without Dylan Sanders.

528
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,503
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Cheers to that.

529
00:51:51,887 --> 00:51:52,638
What's the rush, Helen?

530
00:51:52,638 --> 00:51:54,180
What's the rush, Helen?

531
00:51:58,977 --> 00:52:01,302
You've only been here five minutes.

532
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:05,851
Now, l've waited for you before.

533
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:13,320
Matter of fact,
l've waited for you 2920 days.

534
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:17,356
That's 41 7 weeks.

535
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:21,616
That's 96 months.

536
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:25,288
That's eight years.

537
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,537
Enough about me.

538
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,787
What about you, Helen?
How have you been?

539
00:52:29,963 --> 00:52:31,872
Seamus.

540
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:35,215
l see you still got a nice arse on you.

541
00:52:36,011 --> 00:52:38,252
You got a lot of nerve
stealing from me.

542
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:41,881
-Stealing back's more like it.
-Give us the rings.

543
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,054
Give us the rings.

544
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,074
Give us the rings!

545
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:17,578
Don't lose those.
We'll be taking them back in about...

546
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:21,465
...48 seconds.

547
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:27,929
l've been dreaming one day
l'd get to see you again...

548
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:30,512
...and watch you die.

549
00:53:30,686 --> 00:53:32,844
Keep dreaming.

550
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:40,271
Lights. Somebody get the lights!

551
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:42,938
Seamus.

552
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:45,358
Seamus!

553
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:47,774
Seamus!

554
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,863
You know l always like it
with the light on.

555
00:54:47,506 --> 00:54:51,290
-You don't know me anymore.
-l'm the only one here who knows you.

556
00:55:06,857 --> 00:55:08,435
Wait, wait, wait!

557
00:55:39,137 --> 00:55:41,972
l've got to say, Helen,
l've never wanted you more.

558
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,262
-Always wanting what you can't have.
-Yeah?

559
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:53,098
l'll have you any way l want.

560
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:09,955
l got the rings.
Let's get out of here!

561
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,457
Don't let them get away!

562
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:04,704
Got it?

563
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:22,303
Come on, now!

564
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,034
Let's go.

565
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:46,035
Dylan, let's go.

566
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:19,573
You can't hurt me anymore, Helen.

567
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:22,739
l'm gonna teach you
and your friends about pain.

568
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:29,245
l'm gonna kill them
just so you can hear them scream.

569
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:34,753
Dylan!

570
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:38,749
l got the rings.

571
00:58:39,594 --> 00:58:42,713
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, l'm okay.

572
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:44,264
Hit it.

573
00:59:00,446 --> 00:59:02,735
l know who did it.

574
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:08,446
Hot damn it, l know who did it.

575
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:10,789
Col. Mustard,
in the dining room, with a lead pipe.

576
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:12,829
Col. Mustard,
in the dining room, with a lead pipe.

577
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,542
-Col. Mustard?
-Give me that.

578
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:17,165
-Col. Mustard?
-l said, Col. Mustard...

579
00:59:17,337 --> 00:59:19,828
...in the dining room,
with a lead pipe.

580
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:22,923
-Go ahead and look in there.
-Why don't you look.

581
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:25,131
Col. Must--

582
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:26,678
-Col. Mustard?
-Right.

583
00:59:26,846 --> 00:59:29,716
Col. Mustard? Col. Mustard?

584
00:59:30,557 --> 00:59:32,633
lt's Professor Plum...

585
00:59:33,226 --> 00:59:35,682
...in the conservatory,
with a candlestick.

586
00:59:35,854 --> 00:59:38,142
That's right. You got it right.

587
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:40,556
-Damn!
-How the hell you know that?

588
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:44,980
We took in one just like him
a long time ago, remember?

589
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:49,068
Yeah, Mama, l remember.
You gave my room away.

590
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:56,245
You were the cock?
l was the beaver.

591
00:59:56,414 --> 00:59:59,035
What are the chances that
we were both mascots?

592
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,450
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, God.

593
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:05,791
lt's like we were made for each other.

594
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:10,673
The best l can figure it is,
the clients contact Charlie directly.

595
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:13,002
Okay, then he phones the girls.

596
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,011
They show up at the place
and do their thing.

597
01:00:17,183 --> 01:00:20,350
Now, l know, l know.
At first, l didn't think l could handle it.

598
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:26,558
The late nights, the never knowing
when she'd have to go out on a job.

599
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:29,273
Some of the men
are pretty dangerous.

600
01:00:29,445 --> 01:00:32,280
And the outfits. Oh, boy.

601
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:41,319
l'll be right back, Pete.
lt's just number one. Have fun.

602
01:00:56,678 --> 01:00:58,172
Hello?

603
01:01:15,362 --> 01:01:19,573
l'm gonna say this. Our boy Pete
has no idea what he's getting into.

604
01:01:20,742 --> 01:01:23,742
l don't think he really
understands the responsibility.

605
01:01:23,911 --> 01:01:26,402
-No, no.
-Pete?

606
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:29,332
-The commitment.
-Once they get into your house...

607
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,373
-...you lose all spontaneity.
-Gone.

608
01:01:31,543 --> 01:01:33,037
They do whatever they want.

609
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:35,667
-Pete's asking her tonight?
-That's what he said.

610
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:42,465
But Alex is a wildcat.

611
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:46,586
l mean, she gives
as good as she gets.

612
01:01:47,558 --> 01:01:48,933
Alex! Hey.

613
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:52,304
Jason, Daddy.
What are you doing here, Jason?

614
01:01:52,479 --> 01:01:56,179
l was just explaining to your
father here all about Charlie.

615
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:58,270
Charlie?

616
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:03,071
-Daddy....
-lt's all right, darling. l know.

617
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:05,606
l'm so sorry, Daddy,
that l didn't tell you.

618
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:09,994
l didn't think you'd approve. l know
you wanted me to be a neurosurgeon.

619
01:02:11,163 --> 01:02:14,745
But l've discovered
a whole new way to help people...

620
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,960
...that makes me feel so...

621
01:02:19,629 --> 01:02:21,621
...alive.

622
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:25,042
Whatever makes you happy.

623
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:29,963
l am so relieved!

624
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,138
lt's just been killing me,
you not knowing all these years. l--

625
01:02:34,476 --> 01:02:35,804
Daddy...

626
01:02:35,977 --> 01:02:38,931
...Natalie, Dylan and l are a team.

627
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:43,149
And we just took on 1 2 sailors.

628
01:02:45,736 --> 01:02:49,686
You can't even imagine the
positions we get ourselves into.

629
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:53,815
Daddy, l wish you could watch
us work. You'd be so proud.

630
01:02:54,578 --> 01:02:56,321
l'm gonna take a shower...

631
01:02:56,496 --> 01:03:00,114
...because l am covered in--
Well, you can only imagine what.

632
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:03,458
And then when l get back,
l am gonna give you...

633
01:03:03,628 --> 01:03:06,297
...a full blow-by-blow.

634
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:11,963
Ferret.

635
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:31,104
-Natalie?
-What, Pete?

636
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:34,436
-l've been thinking.
-Yeah?

637
01:03:34,614 --> 01:03:38,612
-About what?
-Well, look...

638
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,366
...l know we just moved in together.

639
01:03:41,537 --> 01:03:43,446
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

640
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:47,786
And l know we agreed
to take this kind of slow.

641
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:50,286
-But--
-Yeah?

642
01:03:51,296 --> 01:03:54,083
There's just something l gotta ask.

643
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:58,841
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah. 'Oh, boy' is right.

644
01:03:59,554 --> 01:04:00,965
So here it goes.

645
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:03,511
-Twirl me first.
-Okay.

646
01:04:18,404 --> 01:04:19,649
Yeah.

647
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:26,654
Hey!

648
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,817
-About that question, Pete?
-Let's talk about it later.

649
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:10,628
' Here's all your stuff back.'

650
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,080
What's up with that?

651
01:06:12,884 --> 01:06:14,676
She's gone.

652
01:06:15,387 --> 01:06:17,463
She's not coming back.

653
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:19,591
She loved these boots.

654
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:22,303
She doesn't want us to get hurt.

655
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,724
Wait a minute,
you ladies risk your ass every day.

656
01:06:26,897 --> 01:06:28,142
Yeah.

657
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:31,150
' l'll never forgive myself
if anything happens to you.'

658
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:33,109
Where do we go from here, Charlie?

659
01:06:33,278 --> 01:06:36,611
Natalie, Alex.
You need to k eep your spirits up.

660
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:38,655
Any leads on the O'Gradys, Charlie?

661
01:06:38,825 --> 01:06:40,948
Any word on how
Seamus broke out of prison?

662
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,692
He didn't break out, Natalie.
He was released.

663
01:06:43,871 --> 01:06:47,204
What? Who would have the power
to pull something like that off?

664
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:49,535
Johnnie Cochran.

665
01:06:49,877 --> 01:06:52,877
The Justice Department,
the DA's office, the FBl.

666
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,622
U.S. Marshal.

667
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:58,712
That's Carter.

668
01:07:04,807 --> 01:07:07,642
l never gave rings to a guy before.

669
01:07:08,227 --> 01:07:10,054
The rings are secure, sir.

670
01:07:10,229 --> 01:07:12,517
And we can all breathe
a little easier.

671
01:07:12,689 --> 01:07:15,643
-w ell done, Angels.
-Thanks, Charlie.

672
01:07:15,817 --> 01:07:17,893
HALO is safe, thanks to you.

673
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:19,777
lt's been a pleasure.

674
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:22,609
l hope to work with you ladies again.

675
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:24,396
But not too soon.

676
01:07:24,909 --> 01:07:26,866
Good luck with everything.

677
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:30,907
Your keys.

678
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,749
-What is it?
-My ribs.

679
01:07:42,175 --> 01:07:44,048
These aren't mine.

680
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:52,839
That was a nice reach for a guy
with a couple of fractured ribs.

681
01:07:53,018 --> 01:07:55,094
Good going, Bos.

682
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,393
-We got him.
-We got who?

683
01:07:57,564 --> 01:08:01,513
Of course, he already had one ring.
He just needed the other.

684
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:04,978
He wanted to fake his own death
so he wouldn't be a suspect.

685
01:08:05,154 --> 01:08:06,778
Who you all talking about?

686
01:08:06,947 --> 01:08:09,154
He needed time for his plan,
so he set up Seamus.

687
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:10,902
Then turned him loose on Dylan.

688
01:08:11,076 --> 01:08:13,069
I think you're onto something,
Angels.

689
01:08:13,328 --> 01:08:16,364
Damn! So Carter's the bad guy!

690
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:21,201
It's just speculation at this point,
Bosley. w e need proof.

691
01:08:21,502 --> 01:08:23,162
-Keys, Bosley.
-Let's hit it.

692
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:24,831
Punk.

693
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:46,933
Road's clear.
You're good to move in.

694
01:08:52,322 --> 01:08:54,066
Almost there.

695
01:08:56,243 --> 01:08:57,986
Oncoming.

696
01:09:08,671 --> 01:09:10,165
Good job, Alex.

697
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:16,544
-Can we go yet?
-No, you can't, son.

698
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,178
l gotta make sure it's safe.

699
01:09:18,346 --> 01:09:21,430
-We're gonna be late.
-You're not gonna be late, young ma--

700
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:22,844
You old grizzly bear!

701
01:09:23,017 --> 01:09:25,093
Son, please work with me, young man.

702
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:28,852
A few more minutes and you'll be
in school. You'll never see me again.

703
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:32,356
Man, you do not mess
with a black man's do!

704
01:09:37,197 --> 01:09:39,154
l got the phone line.

705
01:09:45,371 --> 01:09:47,198
l'm calling from my car.
Go secure.

706
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:53,376
My end of the deal's done.
The Angels are off the case.

707
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:55,955
I have the rings.

708
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,288
Dylan.

709
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,338
Alex! Alex!

710
01:10:06,515 --> 01:10:08,140
Call buyer one.

711
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:09,553
Alex, are you okay?

712
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:12,217
Nat, the handle's broken.
l can't disengage.

713
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,231
The deal's on. Eight o'clock,
just as we discussed.

714
01:10:15,398 --> 01:10:17,225
-Nat, plan B!
-l'm calling in Bosley.

715
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,021
We'll get you out of there, Alex.
Hang tight.

716
01:10:21,237 --> 01:10:23,194
Follow the stars beyond the galaxy.

717
01:10:25,574 --> 01:10:28,196
Take shore to hope.
Stop on a stair.

718
01:10:28,369 --> 01:10:29,744
A stair?

719
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:31,574
Find a man with a map.

720
01:10:31,747 --> 01:10:33,241
Bosley, can you hear me?

721
01:10:33,415 --> 01:10:36,748
Bosley, we're going
to Bravo configuration immediately.

722
01:10:36,918 --> 01:10:38,578
l'm on it. l'm on it. Okay?

723
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:42,003
Now, get back. We're going
to Bravo configuration. Get back!

724
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:47,093
Stop!

725
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:48,838
Stop!

726
01:10:57,145 --> 01:11:00,348
-Come on.
-Okay. Come on, hurry.

727
01:11:01,107 --> 01:11:03,514
Skip. Run.

728
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,275
Get on out of here.

729
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:12,117
Come on. Get on out of here.

730
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,706
-Great job, Bos.
-Yeah, right.

731
01:11:22,001 --> 01:11:25,334
Carter's working with a partner.
They're selling the list tonight.

732
01:11:25,504 --> 01:11:27,793
We'll take care of them
and then find Dylan.

733
01:11:27,965 --> 01:11:31,049
-See you, Bos.
-Yeah, all right, all right.

734
01:11:33,595 --> 01:11:35,753
This is some bullshit.

735
01:12:20,638 --> 01:12:23,758
-Kelly Garrett.
-Hello, Dylan.

736
01:12:23,975 --> 01:12:26,430
Don't you have a case to solve?

737
01:12:28,729 --> 01:12:32,561
Well, l tried to outrun my past,
but it caught up with me yesterday.

738
01:12:33,108 --> 01:12:35,100
And l put my friends in danger.

739
01:12:35,277 --> 01:12:38,230
They're in more danger now
without you.

740
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:42,525
Natalie and Alex are gonna
replace me with someone great.

741
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:47,362
A real Angel. Not someone who's
pretending to be something she's not.

742
01:12:47,538 --> 01:12:51,238
Your past is what makes you
who you are, Dylan.

743
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:54,915
Don't forget that Charlie chose you
for a reason.

744
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:58,044
Angels are like diamonds.

745
01:12:58,214 --> 01:13:01,168
They can't be made.
You have to find them.

746
01:13:03,094 --> 01:13:05,252
Each one is unique.

747
01:13:08,974 --> 01:13:13,517
Sometimes we search too hard
for answers that are right in front of us.

748
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,499
The buyers are set.

749
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,958
We did it, partner!

750
01:14:57,365 --> 01:14:59,903
You know, l never really got
that partner thing.

751
01:15:12,045 --> 01:15:13,374
Hello, Angels.

752
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:15,661
Madison Lee.

753
01:15:16,925 --> 01:15:18,205
Why?

754
01:15:18,384 --> 01:15:20,591
Why be an Angel
when l can play God?

755
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:25,554
Looks like one of the three
amigos has gone adiós.

756
01:15:43,574 --> 01:15:44,855
Welcome back, Dylan.

757
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:47,489
You're such
a typical rebellious Pisces.

758
01:15:47,661 --> 01:15:49,784
Always out to prove
how tough you are...

759
01:15:49,955 --> 01:15:52,909
...and you couldn't make it
one day on your own, could you?

760
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:57,080
Someone reminded me
that every Angel is unique.

761
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,247
And l knew it was you.

762
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:01,545
Who else had contacts in Mongolia...

763
01:16:01,716 --> 01:16:05,215
...could hack the HALO fail-safe
and hire a surfer as an assassin?

764
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:08,589
Same astrological phenom who would
refer to a motocross rider...

765
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:11,433
...with a lion on his helmet as ' Leo.'

766
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,223
Very well done.

767
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,018
Very impressive, really.

768
01:16:20,316 --> 01:16:23,436
You've got it all figured out.

769
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:27,565
And now l'm gonna really enjoy...

770
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:30,527
...knocking those halos right
off your heads.

771
01:16:31,326 --> 01:16:32,986
But you're an Angel.

772
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:35,996
No. You just don't get it.

773
01:16:36,164 --> 01:16:39,948
l don't take orders
from a speaker box anymore.

774
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:42,285
l work for myself.

775
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:45,167
Well, your boss sucks.

776
01:16:47,633 --> 01:16:50,040
The Angels' ass-kicking pose.

777
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:52,045
Seeing the three of you like that...

778
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:56,847
...does give me this little twinge
of nostalgia for the old days.

779
01:16:57,308 --> 01:16:59,597
But back then,
it was a little bit different.

780
01:16:59,769 --> 01:17:02,770
You see, when l was an Angel...

781
01:17:03,105 --> 01:17:05,062
...we used guns.

782
01:17:29,338 --> 01:17:31,377
Sorry, Charlie.

783
01:17:58,448 --> 01:18:00,571
Hello, Angels.

784
01:18:01,492 --> 01:18:03,651
Good evening, Charlie.

785
01:18:03,828 --> 01:18:05,619
l love the new office.

786
01:18:05,788 --> 01:18:08,361
Madison, is that you?
where are the Angels?

787
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:11,114
l'm sure there's three more
where they came from.

788
01:18:11,293 --> 01:18:13,700
Madison, what have you done?

789
01:18:13,879 --> 01:18:18,873
We're just having a little fun.
You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie.

790
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,710
You've never had trouble...

791
01:18:20,885 --> 01:18:23,293
...finding someone
to give their life for you.

792
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:28,263
Hurting the Angels doesn't prove
you're the best. You know that.

793
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:29,680
Do l?

794
01:18:29,852 --> 01:18:32,888
Madison, you were never able
to accept that this agency...

795
01:18:33,063 --> 01:18:35,898
... is about teamwork.
w e're a family. w e do--

796
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:40,193
Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know.
Angels forever.

797
01:18:40,361 --> 01:18:43,030
l've heard the sales pitch.

798
01:18:45,741 --> 01:18:48,314
lt was very seductive...

799
01:18:49,745 --> 01:18:51,405
...once.

800
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:55,328
Madison, you deliberately went
rogue on the DeSoto case...

801
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,869
...and put your fellow Angels
in danger.

802
01:18:59,045 --> 01:19:00,954
when we finally got you
out of there...

803
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:04,962
...you were wounded so badly,
we thought we might lose you.

804
01:19:05,426 --> 01:19:07,549
You did lose me.

805
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:11,136
You see, being an Angel
wasn't fulfilling my destiny.

806
01:19:11,306 --> 01:19:13,678
lt was keeping me from it.

807
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,341
Your destiny is yet to be written.

808
01:19:16,519 --> 01:19:18,726
Do not do this, Madison.

809
01:19:18,897 --> 01:19:23,143
Taking the lives of innocent people
is not the answer.

810
01:19:23,317 --> 01:19:27,362
There must be something
in you that's still good.

811
01:19:34,786 --> 01:19:37,870
l was never good.

812
01:19:41,459 --> 01:19:43,784
l was great.

813
01:20:09,693 --> 01:20:13,192
Damn. What a bitch!

814
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:39,669
You guys,
we have to outthink Madison.

815
01:20:39,846 --> 01:20:42,800
No matter what we do,
she's always two steps ahead of us.

816
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:46,259
-She's selling the list off tonight, 8:00.
-But where?

817
01:20:46,435 --> 01:20:48,843
-Nat, what else did Carter say?
-Okay.

818
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:51,428
'Take the stars beyond the galaxy.'

819
01:20:51,607 --> 01:20:53,433
lt's safe to say
it's on this planet.

820
01:20:53,608 --> 01:20:58,317
'Take shore to hope
and stop on a stair.'

821
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:02,944
-There's a Hope Street downtown.
-But no shore for miles.

822
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:05,152
A stair.

823
01:21:06,704 --> 01:21:08,696
Astaire!

824
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:12,075
Astaire?

825
01:21:12,251 --> 01:21:13,531
Astaire!

826
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:15,703
-Possible concussion.
-l'm worried.

827
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,670
Guys, the stars.
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

828
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:22,879
Beyond the Galaxy Theatre.

829
01:21:23,052 --> 01:21:26,219
There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope
and Fred Astaire.

830
01:21:26,388 --> 01:21:28,879
-Nice, Nat.
-Yeah!

831
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:43,019
l think she's trying to kill us.

832
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:07,331
l can't believe it.
We are here in Hollywood.

833
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,383
-Angels?
-l knew we were gonna do it--

834
01:22:09,553 --> 01:22:10,881
-Shut up, damn it!
-What?

835
01:22:11,054 --> 01:22:12,596
l mean, not you, Mama. Sorry.

836
01:22:12,764 --> 01:22:16,098
-Have you lost your mind?
-Yeah. l mean, no.

837
01:22:16,268 --> 01:22:17,845
We gonna talk about this later.

838
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,532
Diablo Cartel

839
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:34,401
Tanaka Yakuza

840
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:40,947
Antonioni Crime Family

841
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:45,492
-Welcome to the Guinness World of--
-Shut it.

842
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,538
Give us the map.

843
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:35,369
Yahtzee!

844
01:23:40,762 --> 01:23:44,012
Jason! Jason!

845
01:23:45,141 --> 01:23:46,172
Jason!

846
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:48,974
l love you!

847
01:23:54,775 --> 01:23:57,444
-l hear the sequel's insane.
-First one was a classic.

848
01:23:57,610 --> 01:23:58,642
Button your jacket.

849
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,148
-What?
-Button your jacket.

850
01:24:41,484 --> 01:24:44,401
The VlP gathering is on the top floor.

851
01:25:46,627 --> 01:25:49,581
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to obstruct justice.

852
01:25:49,755 --> 01:25:51,463
Freeze!

853
01:26:41,552 --> 01:26:44,043
The Kleinhardt gambit.

854
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:48,385
-Classic.
-And apparently still effective.

855
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,686
We never used to wear Kevlar
till l took three in the chest.

856
01:27:01,029 --> 01:27:04,029
On the DeSoto case! We know!

857
01:27:08,952 --> 01:27:11,241
Don't tell me you forgot about...

858
01:27:11,663 --> 01:27:13,822
...plan B.

859
01:27:19,212 --> 01:27:22,082
l'd recognize that arse anywhere,
you piece of sh--!

860
01:27:30,889 --> 01:27:33,214
Bring it on, bitch.

861
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:11,062
Say something.

862
01:29:20,073 --> 01:29:22,361
Mind if l cut in?

863
01:29:22,533 --> 01:29:24,325
No!

864
01:30:46,694 --> 01:30:48,817
The premiere should be a blast.

865
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:06,165
Bosley, plan B!

866
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:07,795
lt's raining white women!

867
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,176
Plan B stands for ' plan Bosley.'

868
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,178
Yeah!

869
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,690
Get that bitch! Get that bitch!

870
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:32,193
Wow. They really went
all out for this thing. Okay!

871
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,311
Dylan!

872
01:32:26,952 --> 01:32:28,779
Alex!

873
01:33:48,902 --> 01:33:50,610
This is it. You ready?

874
01:33:52,281 --> 01:33:53,905
Are you?

875
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:10,004
Kill...

876
01:34:10,297 --> 01:34:12,254
...or be killed.

877
01:34:12,716 --> 01:34:14,625
Exciting, isn't it?

878
01:34:15,844 --> 01:34:17,254
Who are you?

879
01:34:19,055 --> 01:34:21,890
You want to know who l am, Natalie?

880
01:34:22,725 --> 01:34:24,801
Then you look inside your own heart.

881
01:34:25,436 --> 01:34:27,475
No, Madison.

882
01:34:27,813 --> 01:34:29,640
l'm nothing like you.

883
01:34:30,983 --> 01:34:33,141
l have something you'll never have.

884
01:34:41,993 --> 01:34:44,365
And what's that?

885
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:50,492
Friends.

886
01:35:20,028 --> 01:35:22,945
-Enjoy heaven.
-Go to hell.

887
01:35:57,896 --> 01:35:59,769
She is so fired.

888
01:36:15,579 --> 01:36:17,322
Party time.

889
01:36:27,673 --> 01:36:28,836
-Angels!
-Bosley!

890
01:36:29,008 --> 01:36:30,834
Angels!

891
01:36:32,844 --> 01:36:35,133
-You all get that squirrel-flying lady?
-Yeah!

892
01:36:35,305 --> 01:36:36,680
-Did you scratch her?
-Yeah!

893
01:36:36,848 --> 01:36:40,596
You kick her? You kicked her
kung fu ass? Mama, l told you!

894
01:36:40,768 --> 01:36:42,179
l know it!

895
01:36:42,437 --> 01:36:45,770
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Never!

896
01:36:46,107 --> 01:36:47,850
-You hear that, Mama?
-l heard it.

897
01:36:48,025 --> 01:36:51,061
l've always known
my baby boy was a genius!

898
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:53,394
Why you give my room
away, then, Mama?

899
01:36:53,572 --> 01:36:56,489
l'll tell you why. Max?

900
01:36:56,658 --> 01:36:58,946
Yeah? l'm a Bosley now!

901
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:01,989
-Max Bosley!
-l love Max Bosley!

902
01:37:02,163 --> 01:37:04,120
-Boy, you did it!
-Hallelujah!

903
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:06,781
Daddy! One second. Daddy!

904
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:09,414
Darling! You made it!

905
01:37:09,586 --> 01:37:13,798
We just got done.
Another satisfied client.

906
01:37:14,091 --> 01:37:16,416
We finished her off
sooner than we thought.

907
01:37:16,593 --> 01:37:18,253
-Her?
-lt was a woman this time.

908
01:37:18,428 --> 01:37:21,631
We had to triple-team her,
but we finally got her on her back!

909
01:37:24,433 --> 01:37:26,342
Well done!

910
01:37:26,727 --> 01:37:28,803
No, no, no!

911
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:34,816
-Jason!
-Alex. You made it.

912
01:37:35,569 --> 01:37:39,103
No, no, no! l know.
We're on a time-out, l know.

913
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:43,491
Time-out's over, baby.
We're back in the game!

914
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:51,873
Ferret.

915
01:38:03,928 --> 01:38:06,964
l know you wanted to wait
and everything, but--

916
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:14,265
-You really look beautiful.
-Thanks, Pete.

917
01:38:14,438 --> 01:38:17,522
l've been wanting to ask you this
for a long time.

918
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:20,349
So here goes.

919
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:23,104
Pete.

920
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,957
-Spike?
-Yeah. A puppy.

921
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:40,035
A puppy?

-ls that okay? l know it's a big step.
-Yes!

924
01:38:45,174 --> 01:38:47,380
-You did?
-Yeah.

925
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,838
Dylan! Dylan!

926
01:38:54,224 --> 01:38:55,848
Guess what.

927
01:38:56,017 --> 01:38:57,891
Pete and l have something
to tell you.

928
01:38:58,061 --> 01:38:59,389
-Really?
-We're gonna get--

929
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:03,145
-You're gonna get what?
-A puppy!

930
01:39:03,316 --> 01:39:05,771

-Awesome!
-His name is Spike!

933
01:39:10,572 --> 01:39:13,906
-So you're not leaving?
-No! Of course, you guys.

934
01:39:14,076 --> 01:39:18,120
l get to kick butt with my two best
friends. You think l'd give that up?

935
01:39:18,288 --> 01:39:20,245
No!

936
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:21,957
What about you, Dylan?

937
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,662
With O'Grady out,
you can go back to your old life.

938
01:39:24,835 --> 01:39:27,872
Are you kidding? This is my life.

939
01:39:28,047 --> 01:39:31,795
-What about you, neurosurgeon?
-lt's a no-brainer!

940
01:39:31,967 --> 01:39:33,461

God!

943
01:39:59,576 --> 01:40:02,825
And l know we agreed
to take things slow.

944
01:40:03,454 --> 01:40:06,123
-Yeah?
-But....

945
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,950
-You--
-Sorry.

946
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:19,296
There's an ember in my ass.

947
01:40:26,267 --> 01:40:28,555
We should get this to the lab
and analyse it.

948
01:40:28,727 --> 01:40:30,636
Yeah, just crawl right up in there.

949
