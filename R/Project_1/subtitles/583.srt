1
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:22,432
Who'll pinch me to wake me up?

2
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,543
Who will laugh at me when I fall?

3
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,013
Whose breath will I listen for...

4
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,794
...so that I may sleep?

5
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,164
Whose hand will I hold...

6
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,169
...so that I may walk?

7
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:13,591
We may question ourselves
at moments such as these.

8
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:17,989
Did we make the right decision
to settle here?

9
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,208
We are grateful for the time
we have been given.

10
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,571
What manner of spectacle has attracted
your attention so splendidly?

11
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,880
I ought to carry it in my pocket
to help me teach.

12
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,326
Who came upon this?

13
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,434
- Philip, did you move this?
- No, Mr. Walker.

14
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:58,040
I inspected it carefully. Its head was
twisted back and much of its fur removed.

15
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,483
- I see.
- It was murdered.

16
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,885
But who is the culprit?

17
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:07,481
Who has done this heinous act?

18
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:11,995
- Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.
- There it is.

19
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:15,794
Why would such a notion
come into your mind?

20
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,204
- They're meat eaters.
- Mmm.

21
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,330
They have large claws.

22
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,375
Children...

23
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,346
...Those We Don't Speak Of have not
breached our borders for many years.

24
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,510
We do not go into their woods,

25
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,850
they do not come into our valley.

26
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,891
It is a truce.

27
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,459
We do not threaten them.

28
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,289
Why would they do this?

29
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:49,623
And we ought not to overlook
the Flight of the Birds.

30
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:54,171
We didn't have it last year
and I, for one, missed it desperately.

31
00:07:55,607 --> 00:08:00,408
And I know your wife missed
the children dressed in feathers and such.

32
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,980
- I am fond of it.
- Mmm.

33
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,447
I do not have a say in this matter.

34
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,112
August Nicholson is chair
of today's meeting.

35
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,593
There's a young man who has
requested a word with the elders.

36
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,129
Well, do have him come forward.

37
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,930
Alice.

38
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,838
Hello, Lucius.

39
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,981
"My mother is unaware
of the reason for my visit today."

40
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:43,521
"She did not give her consent
or consult me in any form."

41
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:50,251
"The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness,

42
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:53,195
and other events,
have weighed on my thoughts."

43
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,467
"I ask permission to cross
into the forbidden woods

44
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,662
and travel to the nearest town."

45
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:03,935
"I will gather new medicines,
and I will return."

46
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,705
"With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,

47
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,473
I am certain they will let me pass."

48
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:14,143
"Creatures can sense emotion and fear."

49
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:17,915
"They will see I am pure of intention,
and not afraid."

50
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,991
"The end."

51
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,432
What goes on
in that head of yours?

52
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,235
Say something, Lucius.

53
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:43,511
Finton Coin is in the tower,
and I've promised to sit with him.

54
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,549
Hmm.

55
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,183
Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?

56
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,724
The towns?

57
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,454
What for?

58
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,794
They're wicked places
where wicked people live. That's all.

59
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,370
Thank you, Lucius.

60
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,602
You're a good friend.

61
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:19,015
I do hope no one saw you.

62
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:47,009
What we seem to have amongst us
is a predator of some type,

63
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:51,242
most likely a coyote or a wolf.

64
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:57,485
Its manner of... of killing
and removing the fur,

65
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:00,854
but leaving the flesh torn,

66
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,123
may be a sign that this animal
suffers from madness.

67
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:09,197
And for the next fortnight,
we should be vigilant

68
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,701
for sightings of this coyote.

69
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:16,240
Keep careful watch over
our little ones as they play on the hills.

70
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,542
As for the other notion...

71
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,983
...we do not believe
our boundary has been breached.

72
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:34,582
Those We Don't Speak Of are much
larger creatures than coyotes...

73
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:39,119
...and we would know
if they had been here.

74
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,933
Ahh, it's frightful, this business
with the coyote. Is it not, Papa?

75
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,065
- Do not feel worried, Kitty.
- You are not troubled?

76
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,576
I'm certain it will all end soon.

77
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,412
- Can we speak on other matters, then?
- It would be a relief.

78
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,542
I'm in love!

79
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:04,281
I want your permission
to marry, Papa.

80
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,823
There's a proper manner in which
things are supposed to happen.

81
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,450
Such as the boy would normally be
standing next to you,

82
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,063
in a moment such as this...
Where is the boy in all this, Kitty?

83
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,631
I haven't spoken to him as of yet.

84
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:18,463
The young man is unaware
of your intentions?

85
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:23,337
He has a quiet way. I was going to talk with
him, Papa, but not without your blessings.

86
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,603
I won't talk with him without your blessings.

87
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,076
Kitty!

88
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,374
It's Lucius Hunt.

89
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,441
Lucius?

90
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,544
You think badly of him?

91
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:40,351
- No, no. I have been thinking about him.
- He's not like the other boys, Papa.

92
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,450
He doesn't joke or bounce about.

93
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:44,789
No, he certainly does not.

94
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:49,163
Do I have your blessings, then?

95
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,307
Look, do me one favor first.

96
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:04,815
Do not tell anyone else of your burstings
until you have spoken with the young man.

97
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,581
Good afternoon, Lucius.

98
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,689
I wanted to... to... to tell you something.

99
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,967
I love you, Lucius.

100
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,803
I love you... like the day is long.

101
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:34,468
I love you more than
the sun and the moon together.

102
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:39,141
And if you feel the same way,
then we should not hide it any longer.

103
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:43,084
It's a gift, love is.
We should be thankful.

104
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:47,386
We should bellow it out
with all the breath in our lungs.

105
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:50,325
Thank you! Thank you!

106
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,795
Thank you!

107
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,233
Shh, shh.

108
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,604
Shh.

109
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:12,645
Baby, sleep, gently sleep

110
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:18,280
Life is long and love is deep

111
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:23,952
Time will be sweet for thee

112
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:27,520
All the world to see

113
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,966
Time to look about and know

114
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,006
How the shadows come and go

115
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:42,011
How the breeze stirs the trees

116
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,414
How the blossoms grow

117
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:02,990
I often wondered if you and my son bonded
because neither of you is fond of speaking.

118
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,160
You're very kind.

119
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,206
You must pardon my manners.
I haven't slept in many nights.

120
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,314
You are doing capital,
Jamison.

121
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,185
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.

122
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:28,555
Do not jostle about so. You'll ruin my shirt.

123
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:38,900
They made a sound when I made a sound,
and they mimic before they attack.

124
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,565
Have courage, man.
That's a wives' tale. It isn't true.

125
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:45,369
Do not falter. Steel yourself!

126
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,442
You know,
like a dog can smell you.

127
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,611
- Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?
- Hmm.

128
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,059
You may run from sorrow, as we have.

129
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,790
Sorrow will find you.

130
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,164
It can smell you.

131
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,312
Hurry.

132
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,181
I didn't know you could run so fast.

133
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,952
We're still for running and staying... Hey!

134
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:14,993
Noah ought to be punished. He
whacked little Joseph with a stick again.

135
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,568
- Ouch!
- No more hitting! Put it down!

136
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,832
Ow, ow, ow!

137
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,907
Why don't they grab it?

138
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,213
Noah Percy!

139
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,952
Stop your fussing right this moment.

140
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,765
You're in trouble, you know.

141
00:17:55,907 --> 00:18:00,003
- No hitting, no hitting.
- I'm to place you in the quiet room.

142
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,875
Um, I'll cry quarts.

143
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:07,384
- What if we strike a deal?
- Yeah, capital idea.

144
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,250
It would be prudent to keep our deal
a secret. Can you do that?

145
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,450
Can I keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.

146
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,922
You needn't go to the quiet room
if you a take an oath

147
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,363
to never strike any person again.

148
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,663
- No hitting, no hitting.
- No. No hitting.

149
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,136
- No hitting.
- No hitting.

150
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,173
No hitting.

151
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,341
The deal is struck.

152
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,984
We ought not return right away, huh?

153
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,991
What shall we do
with our stolen time?

154
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,753
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

155
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,728
- Hmm. Shall we have a foot race?
- Yes.

156
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,299
- Up the hill to the resting rock?
- No cheating.

157
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:58,368
What a deeply scandalous thing to say.
I insist you take that back.

158
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,734
Is that the school bell?

159
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,578
lvy, you cheated!

160
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,980
I know! I'm sorry!

161
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,991
Whoo!

162
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,570
My sister cried a lot.

163
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,314
You wonder how I recognized you?

164
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:53,686
Some people - just a handful,
mind you - give off the tiniest color.

165
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,057
It's faint, like a haze.

166
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,622
It's the only thing
I ever see in the darkness.

167
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,064
Papa has it, too.

168
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,502
Do you wonder what your color is?

169
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:11,370
Well, that I won't tell you.
It's not ladylike to speak of such things.

170
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,603
You shouldn't even have asked.

171
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:23,714
You run like a boy.

172
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,449
Thank you.

173
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,795
I know why you denied my sister.

174
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,464
When I was younger...

175
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,200
...you used to hold my arm
when I walked.

176
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,510
Then suddenly, you stopped.

177
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:51,479
One day, I even tripped
in your presence, and nearly fell.

178
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,350
I was faking, of course,
but still, you did not hold me.

179
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,250
Sometimes we don't do
things we want to do

180
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:03,953
so that others won't know
we want to do them.

181
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,306
What?

182
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:30,351
What's this? Oh, berries.

183
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,753
What a splendid present.

184
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,791
Be cautious.

185
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,224
You are holding the bad color.

186
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:48,302
This color attracts Those We Don't
Speak Of. You must bury it.

187
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:53,974
You ought not to pick
that color berry any more.

188
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,674
He picked it from his pocket.

189
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,912
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.

190
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,751
I've never set eyes
on these before.

191
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,554
You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?

192
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,001
"Today at Resting Rock,

193
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:22,630
Noah Percy handed lvy Walker berries
of the bad color."

194
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,901
"When asked where
he found these berries,

195
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,477
for they were not like
others I have seen,

196
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,843
he pointed to the drawing
upon Resting Rock."

197
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,812
"It is my belief that Noah Percy
has entered the woods,

198
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,287
and has done so on many occasions."

199
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,791
"It is also my belief that,
because of his innocence,

200
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,421
those creatures who reside
in the woods did not harm him."

201
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:49,965
"This strengthens my feeling
that they will let me pass

202
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,003
if they sense I am not a threat."

203
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:57,499
We shall speak of the town,
just this once,

204
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,702
and we shall never speak of it again.

205
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:09,014
Your father left for the market
on a Tuesday,

206
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,089
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

207
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:21,465
He was found robbed and naked
in the filthy river, two days later.

208
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:30,665
Why'd you tell me this blackness?

209
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:34,073
So you will know the nature
of what you desire.

210
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:38,882
I do not desire it.
My intentions are true to my word.

211
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:41,451
I think of nothing
but the people of this village.

212
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:46,751
Forgive me.
I am but scared for my only son's life.

213
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,157
I am not the one with secrets.

214
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,554
What is your meaning?

215
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,668
There are secrets
in every corner of this village.

216
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:05,005
Do you not feel it? Do you not see it?

217
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,534
That is for my own well-being,

218
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,740
so the evil things from my past
are kept close and not forgotten.

219
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:14,409
Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

220
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,453
Then let us open it.

221
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:18,953
No!

222
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,753
Perhaps we should speak
with Edward Walker together.

223
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,226
- He may be able...
- He hides, too.

224
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,764
He hides his feelings for you.

225
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,531
Oh.

226
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,269
Sometimes we don't do things,

227
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:45,314
yet others know we want to do things,
so we don't do them.

228
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,685
What nonsense are you saying?

229
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,394
You needn't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

230
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,732
You remind me of a colt sometimes.

231
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,343
What makes you think
he has feelings for me?

232
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,884
He never touches you.

233
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,525
There's no escape!

234
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:47,797
Oh, hello.

235
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,333
I was just playing a game with Noah.

236
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:53,460
The rascal must have gone
to hide in my house again.

237
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:55,595
Houses are against the rules!

238
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,004
He knows that.

239
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:03,009
Are you all right?

240
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:11,013
We're tending to the children tonight,
Kitty and I. I should be with her. Be well.

241
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,260
I heard my parents speaking of you.

242
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:24,630
I know of your request to go to the towns.

243
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:28,933
I think it is noble,
but I do not think it is right.

244
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:32,873
Are you not angry
you have no sight?

245
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,970
I see the world, Lucius Hunt.

246
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:39,345
Just not as you see it.

247
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:50,151
What of Noah, then?

248
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:54,960
What if there are medicines for Noah
that could help him be still and to learn?

249
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:59,366
May we stop speaking of this?
It is putting knots in my stomach.

250
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:07,569
Kitty is to be married.

251
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:14,312
She's found love, again,
with Christop Crane.

252
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:16,909
You think it an odd choice, right?

253
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:22,890
You know, he won't sit back in his chair
for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.

254
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,623
But he does have
a gentlemanly way about him...

255
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:30,860
...and he does care for my sister deeply.

256
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,502
I think Kitty is blessed.

257
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:40,676
I am blessed as well.

258
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:43,941
My older sister is now spoken for.

259
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,245
I am now free to receive
interest from anyone...

260
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,912
...who might have interest.

261
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:04,762
I'm going to get you. Oh!

262
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,236
I got you. I got you.
Can you fetch a blanket for me?

263
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,773
Have you seen Noah?

264
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,124
Lucius?

265
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:51,237
Lucius?

266
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,321
- Hurry, to the cellar!
- Oh, good gracious!

267
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:01,641
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Close the door.

268
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,310
- Noah, close the door, OK?
- They're coming.

269
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,685
- Close the door.
- Coming!

270
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:10,152
Here we go.

271
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,196
- Noah, come on inside!
- Come on inside!

272
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,593
Everyone, inside!
Everyone, inside!

273
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:45,051
- They're coming. Come on in.
- Let's close the door.

274
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,393
- Lucius is outside, walking.
- They're coming.

275
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:53,061
He's inside safe somewhere!
Please, close the door!

276
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:57,801
He'll come back to make sure we're safe.

277
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,502
Ivy! lvy, please.

278
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,599
- Please.
- No.

279
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:35,377
Don't let them in.

280
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,283
Come on in.

281
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:08,034
By the markings we find
this morning on our homes...

282
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:15,970
...I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened.

283
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,414
Creatures have never
attacked us without reason.

284
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:23,714
Does anyone here know of a reason...

285
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,914
...why these events may have occurred?

286
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,965
Who has written this note?

287
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,441
"Please read so that all may hear."

288
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,144
"I have brought this burden upon us."

289
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:03,052
"On the day before last,
I crossed the forbidden line

290
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,491
into Covington Woods..."

291
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:09,862
"...and was witnessed there
by Those We Don't Speak Of."

292
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,800
"I am deeply sorry."

293
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:16,634
"I have shamed myself and my family."

294
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,471
"I pray that my actions
will cause no further pains."

295
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:23,774
"With deepest sorrow, Lucius Hunt."

296
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,969
Is he in trouble?

297
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,917
Do not fret.

298
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,663
You are fearless in a way
that I shall never know.

299
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,316
We are grateful...

300
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,754
...for the time we have been given.

301
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,155
Yes. Yes, indeed.

302
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,098
Cheers.

303
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:36,673
I had an elder sister.

304
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,613
Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets.

305
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,483
Oh, Kitty reminds me of her so.

306
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,484
What manner of person was she?

307
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,820
- Saucy.
- Oh.

308
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,365
And we fought endlessly.

309
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,636
May I ask her name?

310
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,869
Why did she not come
to Covington Woods?

311
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:18,209
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

312
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,760
A group of men took her life
in an alley by our home.

313
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,064
Please rise!

314
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,101
Come on.

315
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:09,728
She's not going to squeeze
my shirt like that, is she?

316
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:26,381
Many blessings
on this most joyous of days.

317
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:29,014
It was a rare and lovely ceremony,
was it not?

318
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,093
Glorious.

319
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,060
I saw your hand move to your eyes
on more than one occasion.

320
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:40,728
That must have been dust of some matter.

321
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:04,485
Mr. Walker!

322
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,220
- Mr. Walker!
- Mr. Walker!

323
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,663
Behind them.

324
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,065
How did she deal
with this brightness?

325
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:22,171
Help us out.

326
00:42:22,305 --> 00:42:24,000
Where are
the rest of them?

327
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:30,738
Speak up.

328
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,313
- They're in the village.
- What?

329
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,511
They left more warnings.

330
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:38,985
They wish us to leave.

331
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:41,420
That cannot be.

332
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:44,255
One saw us.

333
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:46,521
It ran off into the darkness.

334
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:49,097
You are certain?

335
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,733
Can you boys stay close to lvy here?

336
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:02,470
She'll tell you some funny stories
and have you laughing soon.

337
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,188
We will go together.

338
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:13,005
Livestock has been taken
and skinned.

339
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,484
The hides and feathers are missing.

340
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:21,580
There are marks on the door
where it was opened.

341
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,520
The marks are high.

342
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:31,122
Coyotes cannot reach that height.

343
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,122
The elders are going to have
an inquiry tomorrow.

344
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:41,863
Each member of the village is to be
questioned in the meeting hall.

345
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,303
To see how
the border was breached?

346
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,375
Yes.

347
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,340
It is cold outside.

348
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,713
You ought to go in.

349
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:02,049
Why are you on this porch?

350
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,217
It is not safe.

351
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,591
There are other porches.

352
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,863
Do you find me too much of a tomboy?

353
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,933
I do long to do boy things...

354
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:21,075
...like that game
the boys play at the stump.

355
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,941
They put their backs to the woods,

356
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,881
and see how long they can wait
before getting scared.

357
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:32,821
That's so exciting.

358
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,691
I understand you hold the record.

359
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:41,988
It will never be broken, they say.

360
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:45,556
It's just children's games.

361
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:49,900
How is it you are brave when all
the rest of us shake in our boots?

362
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:57,941
I do not worry about what will happen,
only what needs to be done.

363
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,185
How did you know I was here?

364
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,584
I saw you out the window.

365
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,489
No...

366
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,493
...I won't tell you your color.

367
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:15,120
Stop asking.

368
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,432
When we are married,
will you dance with me?

369
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:26,974
I find dancing very agreeable.

370
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:34,673
Why can you not say what is in your head?

371
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:41,046
Why can you not stop saying
what is in yours?

372
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:47,690
Why must you lead, when I want to lead?

373
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:51,392
If I want to dance, I will ask you to dance.

374
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:55,937
If I want to speak,
I will open my mouth and speak.

375
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,370
Everyone is forever
plaguing me to speak further.

376
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:04,173
Why? What good is it to tell you

377
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,147
you are in my every thought
from the time I wake?

378
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,742
What good can come from my saying
l- I sometimes cannot think clearly,

379
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:13,754
or do my work properly?

380
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:19,193
What gain can rise from my telling you
the only time I feel fear as others do...

381
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,521
...is when I think of you in harm?

382
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:29,062
That is why I am on this porch, lvy Walker.

383
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,434
I fear for your safety before all others.

384
00:48:39,048 --> 00:48:40,982
And, yes...

385
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,779
...I will dance with you
on our wedding night.

386
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,301
I had been to the storage shed
twice to fetch food

387
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,469
prior to the wedding ceremony.

388
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,775
And the livestock
was untouched at that time?

389
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:16,283
Yes, Mrs. Hunt.
All was as it should be.

390
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,586
Thank you, Beatrice.

391
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,932
I beg your pardon.

392
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:34,002
Is it true... about Lucius and lvy?

393
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:38,202
There are whispers all over the village.

394
00:49:41,544 --> 00:49:46,345
We were informed early this morning
of their intentions.

395
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:51,250
It is amazing to witness
which two people love chooses to unite.

396
00:49:51,354 --> 00:49:53,879
It follows no rules.

397
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:56,454
Kitty...

398
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,824
I wanted to speak with you first.

399
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:04,957
I would not want you to feel pain,
in any fashion.

400
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:08,161
You are my cherished one.

401
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:12,604
If you were to feel badly
about Lucius, I would not have it.

402
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:16,873
One love to sacrifice
another love is not right.

403
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:26,345
There is nothing you could do
that would sacrifice my love for you.

404
00:50:27,957 --> 00:50:30,949
You are my cherished one as well.

405
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:42,635
God bless you and your life together.

406
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,926
What's happened?

407
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,370
Is this about lvy and myself?

408
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,913
I know you are very fond of her.

409
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,488
And I know she is fond of you.

410
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,494
There are different types of love.

411
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,886
Oh.

412
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:15,055
Oh, God.

413
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:32,147
Oh, lvy...

414
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:57,564
Noah?

415
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:05,044
You'll be late for the meeting hall. Would
you like your father to walk you there?

416
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,681
Noah?

417
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,999
Oh...

418
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,011
The bad... The bad color.

419
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:41,345
Oh...

420
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,783
The bad color, the bad color...

421
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:58,433
Mama!

422
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:07,399
- I beg your pardon.
- What is it?

423
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,070
There's been an accident.

424
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:27,587
Noah Percy was found with quarts
of blood upon his clothes and hands.

425
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:31,324
The blood was not his own,
and he will not speak as to whose it is.

426
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:34,527
God in heaven.

427
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:35,694
Ivy!

428
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,207
Is there anyone injured in here?

429
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:42,903
Has anyone
been hurt in this home?

430
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,148
Is anyone in here?

431
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:49,183
Is anyone hurt in this house?

432
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,962
22, 23, 24...

433
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:15,469
31, 32, 33...

434
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,794
Lucius?

435
00:55:39,268 --> 00:55:41,202
Lucius Hunt!

436
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:45,800
You answer me right this moment!

437
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:12,560
Is anyone hurt in this house?

438
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,970
They're fine.

439
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,007
Mr. Walker!

440
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,646
Joseph!

441
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:33,984
Papa... I cannot see his color.

442
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,753
Ivy.

443
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,831
Come away. Come away.

444
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:45,399
Come away. Here, take her.

445
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:47,764
Take her.

446
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,805
No!

447
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,870
He has suffered a great deal.

448
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,516
He may pass at any time.

449
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,753
Please give him all your prayers
and good thoughts.

450
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,020
He will hear them.

451
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:04,445
Turn!

452
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,263
I am in love.

453
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,942
I know.

454
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,572
He is in love with me.

455
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,082
I know.

456
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,252
If he dies...

457
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,153
...all that is life to me will die with him.

458
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:55,290
I ask permission...

459
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,867
...to travel through Covington Woods...

460
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:06,040
...and go to the towns...

461
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,479
...to retrieve medicines...

462
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,517
...that may save...

463
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,554
...Lucius Hunt.

464
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:33,334
You are my father.

465
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,734
I will listen to you in all things.

466
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,135
I will trust your decision.

467
00:59:46,615 --> 00:59:52,053
I've done what I can to close
the wounds. There's an infection.

468
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,782
What can be done to mend him?

469
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,754
We can only pray.

470
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:03,895
If there were no limitations,
what could be done?

471
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,364
Hmm?

472
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,734
What are you asking me?

473
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:18,812
Is there anything at all
that can be done to mend the boy?

474
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:27,655
Please, Victor. Would you be so kind
as to answer my question?

475
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:40,168
If the infection is contained,
he may still survive.

476
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,630
I must speak up.

477
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:49,971
You have a restless spirit.

478
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,547
I know the thing that is in your head.

479
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:58,013
You're thinking of going to the towns.

480
01:00:59,054 --> 01:01:01,352
Tell me I'm wrong.

481
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:08,797
You have made an oath, Edward,
as all have, never to go back.

482
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,867
It is a painful bargain,
but no good can come without sacrifice.

483
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,335
These are your words I'm saying.
You cannot break the oath.

484
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:18,872
- It is sacred.
- It is a crime,

485
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,602
what has happened to Lucius.

486
01:01:23,412 --> 01:01:25,642
You have taken the oath.

487
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:29,616
You and the rest of the elders...
Are you listening to me?

488
01:01:29,718 --> 01:01:31,652
You...

489
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,651
...have taken the oath.

490
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:06,586
The moment I heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

491
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:10,591
and that she would forever be blind,
I was sitting in that very chair.

492
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:15,862
I was so ashamed.

493
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:23,635
What do you know about your grandfather?

494
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,002
He was the wealthiest man in the towns?

495
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:32,238
That he was. He had a gift for that.

496
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:38,320
If he was given one dollar, in less than a
fortnight, he would have turned it into five.

497
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,553
You do not know of money.
It is not part of our life here.

498
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,320
Money can be a wicked thing.

499
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:49,522
It can turn men's hearts black -
good men's hearts.

500
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,362
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

501
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:58,940
he was a poor judge of a man's character.
Your grandfather was a good man, lvy.

502
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:01,508
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

503
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,636
He used to hold my hand as I hold yours.

504
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,749
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

505
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:13,880
and told me to lead
when others would only follow.

506
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,454
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

507
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:25,260
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

508
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:31,397
I tell you this so you will understand
some of the reasons for my actions,

509
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,201
and...

510
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:37,541
...and the actions of others.

511
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:44,883
You are a strong one, lvy.
You lead when others would follow.

512
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,922
You see light
when there is only darkness.

513
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,993
I trust you.

514
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,734
I trust you among all others.

515
01:04:05,207 --> 01:04:07,675
Thank you, Father.

516
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,370
Ivy, do you know where you are?

517
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,574
At the old shed that is not to be used.

518
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:19,253
Yeah.

519
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,623
- Ivy.
- Yes, Father?

520
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:28,395
Do your very best not to scream.

521
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:38,204
What?

522
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:14,371
I am leaving to fetch you medicines.

523
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:18,841
I had a difficult time getting away.

524
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,915
What is it?

525
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,692
lvy...

526
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,761
...has asked...

527
01:05:34,963 --> 01:05:37,761
...to go to the towns...

528
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,801
...for medicines.

529
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,727
Christop.

530
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,168
Christop...

531
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,643
you needn't be scared.

532
01:07:32,814 --> 01:07:34,805
We have the magic rocks.

533
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,918
They will keep us safe.

534
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:42,084
Why have we not heard
of these rocks before?

535
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:46,319
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.

536
01:07:46,461 --> 01:07:48,554
There is nothing to fear.

537
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,466
Then why do you wear the cloak
of the safe color?

538
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,265
We will light torches.

539
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:59,135
It will be safe.

540
01:07:59,274 --> 01:08:01,208
It is forbidden.

541
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,812
Christop.

542
01:08:52,427 --> 01:08:54,292
Ivy...

543
01:08:54,429 --> 01:08:57,125
there's something in these woods.

544
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,933
It turns my stomach to rot.

545
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:13,910
You will be safe. They will not harm you,
because you cannot see.

546
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,951
They will take pity on you,
the way they took pity on Noah

547
01:09:17,085 --> 01:09:19,679
when... when he ventured in the woods.

548
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:25,492
They will kill me, lvy.

549
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:28,488
I cannot stay.

550
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:38,699
You're better in these woods
than most boys. Anyone would say so.

551
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,604
It is my burden, Finton.

552
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,080
- You may go.
- Come with me.

553
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,475
Do your very best not to scream.

554
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:33,627
There's an odd smell.

555
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,868
It is ahead of you.

556
01:10:42,604 --> 01:10:45,129
What is it?

557
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:47,764
I cannot explain in words.

558
01:10:49,377 --> 01:10:51,868
It is just a few steps.

559
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:08,823
- Those We Don't Speak Of!
- Do not be frightened.

560
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:12,792
It is only farce.

561
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:19,002
Do not be frightened.

562
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:35,252
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

563
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:39,326
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

564
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:43,561
The screams from the woods?

565
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:48,527
We created those sounds.

566
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,138
The Ceremony of Meat?

567
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:55,676
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

568
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:59,042
The drills -
they are farce, too?

569
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,480
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, lvy.

570
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:09,554
What about the animals -
the skinned ones?

571
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:14,721
- Are the elders responsible for that, too?
- I believe one of the elders is responsible.

572
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,094
It will not happen again.

573
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:21,033
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone irreplaceable,

574
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:27,768
who has not felt loss so deeply that they
questioned the very merit of living at all.

575
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:30,343
It is a darkness I wished...

576
01:12:31,379 --> 01:12:33,711
...you would never know.

577
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:41,353
Forgive us our silly lies, lvy.
They were not meant to harm.

578
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:54,494
I am... sad for you, Papa.

579
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:59,469
For all the elders.

580
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:13,651
On this paper has been written
a tool of medicine.

581
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:15,723
It is common in the towns.

582
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:19,418
You will go... with two escorts.

583
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:22,629
Follow the sounds of the stream.

584
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:26,063
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

585
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:30,331
At this hidden road, the two escorts
will wait as you continue.

586
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:34,568
You alone will follow the road...

587
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:39,374
...and leave Covington Woods.

588
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:44,315
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

589
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:46,785
...and return with haste.

590
01:13:49,557 --> 01:13:51,889
I cannot come with you.

591
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:59,390
You gave your heart to this boy.

592
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:03,564
He is in need.

593
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,601
Are you ready to take this burden,

594
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:13,238
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

595
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:26,420
I am making fresh cloths for Lucius.
He needs them.

596
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,723
Alice, I've sent for help.

597
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:36,103
I've sent lvy to the towns.

598
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,774
You cannot.

599
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:45,578
It is all that I can give you.

600
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,189
It is all that I can give you.

601
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,529
I accept.

602
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:28,414
- What have you done?
- He is the victim of a crime.

603
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:32,151
We have agreed never to go back. Never.

604
01:15:32,293 --> 01:15:34,727
What was the purpose of our leaving?

605
01:15:34,829 --> 01:15:39,960
Let us not forget it was out of hope
of something good and right.

606
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,229
You should not have made
decisions without us.

607
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,339
- You have gone too far.
- I'm guilty, Robert!

608
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:51,069
I made a decision of the heart.
I cannot look into another's eyes

609
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:56,583
and see the same look
I see in August's without justification!

610
01:15:56,684 --> 01:15:59,744
It is too painful. I cannot bear it!

611
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,914
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

612
01:16:06,861 --> 01:16:10,490
Who do you think
will continue this place, this life?

613
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,502
Do you plan to live forever?

614
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:19,502
It is in them that our future lies.

615
01:16:19,607 --> 01:16:24,237
It is in lvy and Lucius that
this... this way of life will continue.

616
01:16:25,246 --> 01:16:28,306
Yes, I have risked! I hope I am always able

617
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:32,079
to risk everything
for the just and right cause.

618
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:40,423
If we did not make this decision, we could
never again call ourselves innocent.

619
01:16:40,528 --> 01:16:45,830
And that, in the end, is what we
have protected here - innocence!

620
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,629
That, I'm not ready to give up.

621
01:16:56,377 --> 01:16:58,368
Let her go.

622
01:17:00,915 --> 01:17:03,213
If it ends, it ends.

623
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:11,321
We can move towards hope.
It's what's beautiful about this place.

624
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:15,294
We must not run from heartache.

625
01:17:16,364 --> 01:17:18,332
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

626
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:20,400
The rest of my family died here.

627
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:23,971
Heartache is a part of life.
We know that now.

628
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:26,903
Ivy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

629
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:32,111
If this place is worthy,
she'll be successful in her quest.

630
01:17:35,049 --> 01:17:37,483
How could you have sent her?

631
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,712
She's blind.

632
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:44,620
She's more capable
than most in this village...

633
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:49,424
...and she is led by love.

634
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:52,965
The world moves for love.

635
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,000
It kneels before it in awe.

636
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:13,584
All the world to see

637
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:17,818
Time to look about and know

638
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:22,020
How the shadows come and go

639
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:26,260
How the breeze stirs the trees

640
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:30,462
How the blossoms grow

641
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,598
Sleep, baby, sleep

642
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:38,543
Sleep, gently sleep

643
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:58,511
There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

644
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:01,110
It is in one of the history books
I used to teach in the towns.

645
01:23:27,034 --> 01:23:29,400
It is not real.

646
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:31,795
It is not real.

647
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:13,166
Noah?

648
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,235
- Oh, my God. What is this?
- What is this?

649
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,365
Where is he?

650
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,513
He found one of the suits
we kept under the floorboards.

651
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:30,641
Oh, no.

652
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,980
Oh, God.

653
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:35,214
The animals.

654
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:04,673
His will to live is very strong.

655
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:50,782
A half day's journey
will bring you to a hidden road.

656
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:55,191
You alone will follow the road...

657
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:59,131
...and leave Covington Woods.

658
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:04,864
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

659
01:29:05,806 --> 01:29:08,104
...and return with haste.

660
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:19,197
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

661
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,969
A group of men raped and killed her.

662
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:26,273
They stuffed her in a Dumpster...

663
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:30,879
three blocks from our apartment.

664
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:34,920
My brother worked
in an emergency room downtown.

665
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:39,323
A drug addict came in
with a wound to his ribs.

666
01:31:39,426 --> 01:31:42,054
My brother tried to dress the wound.

667
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,963
He pulled a gun from his jacket...

668
01:31:46,066 --> 01:31:49,968
...then he shot my brother
through his left eye.

669
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:52,231
My husband, Michael,

670
01:31:52,339 --> 01:31:56,673
left for the supermarket
at a quarter past nine in the morning.

671
01:31:56,810 --> 01:32:02,112
He was found
with no money and no clothes

672
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:04,741
in the East River, three days later.

673
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:09,481
My father was shot
by a business partner,

674
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:13,424
who then hanged himself
in my father's closet.

675
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:16,188
They had argued over money.

676
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,298
I am a professor.

677
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:23,928
I teach American History
at the University of Pennsylvania.

678
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:26,403
I have an idea...

679
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:30,172
...that I would like to talk to you about.

680
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:35,815
Mile 27- there's a girl.
I'm gonna check it out.

681
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:38,213
Be careful.

682
01:32:59,339 --> 01:33:02,308
You're not allowed to go in there.

683
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:04,570
Please return to your vehicle.

684
01:33:04,678 --> 01:33:07,146
What was that noise?

685
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:14,052
What are you doing out here?
How... how'd you get here?

686
01:33:14,154 --> 01:33:16,452
Are you from the towns?

687
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:19,492
Uh...

688
01:33:19,626 --> 01:33:21,890
Where are you from?

689
01:33:24,898 --> 01:33:27,526
The woods.

690
01:33:30,637 --> 01:33:33,333
You came from the woods?

691
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:37,841
In there?

692
01:33:38,979 --> 01:33:41,470
Will you help me?

693
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:45,915
I need to find a doctor of medicine.

694
01:33:46,019 --> 01:33:48,249
I must find these things.
We must make haste.

695
01:33:48,388 --> 01:33:50,720
Listen, ma'am.

696
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:54,191
I'm just supposed to...

697
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:15,114
Is someone hurt?

698
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,181
Please, sir. We must make haste.

699
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:27,889
- Well, you... you live in there?
- I do, sir.

700
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:39,231
Breaker.

701
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:44,000
- What is your name?
- Kevin.

702
01:34:44,678 --> 01:34:46,612
Kevin.

703
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:50,046
You have kindness in your voice.

704
01:34:51,818 --> 01:34:54,343
I did not expect that.

705
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:03,661
We have guard shacks every ten miles
around the perimeter of the preserve.

706
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:09,225
We keep medical supplies in there
in case of animal bites or related injuries.

707
01:35:09,369 --> 01:35:12,600
You can find the things
written on the paper?

708
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:16,100
Uh...

709
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,179
- You have to wait here.
- Please, sir.

710
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:21,611
Please... take this as payment.

711
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:31,123
Wait, y-you're not...

712
01:35:31,258 --> 01:35:33,954
You're not tricking me, are you?

713
01:35:34,094 --> 01:35:37,029
I do not understand.

714
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,826
What's your name?

715
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:43,903
lvy.

716
01:35:45,839 --> 01:35:48,569
Ivy Elizabeth Walker.

717
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,769
There's an overturned tractor-trailer

718
01:35:52,879 --> 01:35:55,313
causing a one-hour delay
at the Lincoln Tunnel.

719
01:35:55,415 --> 01:35:57,542
The body of seven-year-old
Katrina Nelson was found today.

720
01:35:57,684 --> 01:35:59,675
She'd been missing for three days.

721
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:04,052
Another 14 soldiers died in combat
when a bomb exploded in their convoy.

722
01:36:04,157 --> 01:36:05,522
It's 35 degrees outside.

723
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,825
What's with the girl?
I tried calling you back on the walkie.

724
01:36:10,964 --> 01:36:13,489
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, it was just some teenagers.

725
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:16,330
They were lost.

726
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:20,770
Can I give you some advice?
Don't get into conversations.

727
01:36:20,874 --> 01:36:24,935
You start talkin', you start gettin' into
how some estate is payin' all of us,

728
01:36:25,078 --> 01:36:28,479
and no one's allowed to go in there
and disturb the animal sanctuary.

729
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:31,016
People's interest gets piqued.

730
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:34,952
It's a really easy gig, Kevin.
Maintain and protect the border.

731
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:38,991
That's it. A few years ago,

732
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,061
it got out in the papers that some
government guys had been paid off

733
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:45,860
to keep plane routes
from flying over this place.

734
01:36:45,999 --> 01:36:48,263
That was a very
stressful time for me.

735
01:36:48,368 --> 01:36:50,495
Don't cause me any troubles.

736
01:36:50,637 --> 01:36:53,128
Do not get into conversations.

737
01:37:44,624 --> 01:37:47,491
Hey, Jay,
where's the maintenance ladder?

738
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:52,194
I n-need to fix a sign.

739
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:55,701
It's in the back.

740
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:07,570
Ivy has returned
with medicines from the towns.

741
01:39:07,707 --> 01:39:10,642
She was attacked
by a creature and killed it.

742
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:23,751
Noah.

743
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:26,324
Oh, God.

744
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,724
We will find him.

745
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:33,725
We will give him...

746
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:37,603
...a proper burial.

747
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:42,872
We will tell the others...

748
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:48,775
...he was killed by the creatures.

749
01:39:53,186 --> 01:39:55,984
Your son has made our stories real.

750
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,787
Noah has given us a chance
to continue this place...

751
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:10,459
...if that is something...

752
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:15,871
...we still wish for.

753
01:41:27,847 --> 01:41:30,372
I'm back, Lucius.
