1
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:18,779
ln 1973, Egypt and Syria launched
a surprise attack against lsrael.

2
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:28,860
By Day Two, lsraeli ground forces
appeared on the verge of defeat.

3
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:31,357
ln the event that their ground forces
were overrun,

4
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:40,438
an lsraeli A-4 jet
took off on patrol. . .

5
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:47,008
. . .with one nuclear bomb.

53
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,445
<i>- Why not negotiate?
- The interview is over.</i>

54
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:42,784
<i>Only criminals and their friends
in the West wish it to be separate.</i>

55
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:46,455
<i>But, Mr. President,
if you will kindly come back...</i>

56
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:49,625
<i>we do have a few more questions
we would like to ask you.</i>

97
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,067
So what is it?

98
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,043
Are you blind?

99
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,645
It's a bomb.

100
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,647
Where's the fuse?

101
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:09,825
It's warm.

102
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,125
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night.

103
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,256
It's a dud.

104
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,264
Let's get it on the truck.

105
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,328
But how can we sell it now?

106
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,297
There's always someone
who'll buy this crap.

107
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:13,115
I cannot stand all these questions
about my health.

108
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:19,329
I am to be described as
"robust" and "healthy".

279
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,447
<i>Zdrastuyte, William Cabot.</i>

293
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:49,158
Where you received
highest honors in English.

459
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:19,934
<i>For ten years now,
we have contended--</i>

461
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:30,777
<i>Finally...</i>

462
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,248
<i>every nation has a right
to defend itself.</i>

463
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:38,784
<i>This terrorism must end.</i>

464
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:43,249
<i>The bombing of Chechnya
was my decision.</i>

466
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:03,764
Who did it?

467
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:07,393
General Pildysh, General Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists.

468
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:09,436
Bastards.

469
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:12,690
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself.

470
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:15,109
Just disappear them.

471
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:19,613
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control.

472
00:42:19,822 --> 00:42:25,035
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent.

501
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,581
Your scarf, Monsieur.

521
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:11,071
I expected this.

522
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,990
Really?

523
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:20,080
What will you do?

524
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,500
Nothing.

525
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:26,420
We will do nothing.

537
00:48:16,512 --> 00:48:19,473
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.

538
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:22,184
At the end of the corridor.

539
00:48:28,357 --> 00:48:31,485
I haven't seen Sasha since university.

540
00:48:31,694 --> 00:48:36,824
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you.

541
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:41,662
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you.

542
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:49,211
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money.

543
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,674
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't.

544
00:48:53,883 --> 00:48:56,844
He has a secret job.

545
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,638
For the government?

546
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:02,016
For imbeciles with money.

547
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:08,022
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that.

548
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,483
They even told him
not to call his mother.

549
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:12,693
The pigs.

550
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:17,490
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother.

551
00:49:17,698 --> 00:49:21,911
But my Sasha, he called.

552
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:24,205
Just last night.

568
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:54,378
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.

569
00:50:54,587 --> 00:50:59,425
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves.

570
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:10,060
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

571
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:13,063
You're crazy.

572
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:17,902
I'm going out.

832
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:06,760
Attention.

833
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:09,096
You've heard of the bomb in the USA.

834
01:18:09,305 --> 01:18:11,599
What you haven't heard
is that 15 minutes ago

835
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:16,061
an American ICBM hit Moscow.

836
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:23,277
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea.

837
01:18:23,486 --> 01:18:25,988
Man your aircraft.

877
01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:08,651
But rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely.

878
01:21:10,653 --> 01:21:13,113
He's fishing.

879
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:15,282
Send our reply.

888
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:49,733
...but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression.

889
01:21:51,026 --> 01:21:53,362
He thinks we did this.

890
01:21:53,571 --> 01:21:56,824
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons.

891
01:21:57,032 --> 01:22:02,663
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide.

892
01:22:02,872 --> 01:22:06,500
Increase the alert status.

903
01:23:55,484 --> 01:23:58,279
I ordered no such attack.

904
01:23:58,487 --> 01:24:01,282
You must not respond to this action...

908
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:14,962
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

909
01:24:15,171 --> 01:24:18,132
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.

965
01:28:04,748 --> 01:28:05,737
What?

966
01:28:05,849 --> 01:28:07,908
Spinnaker.

991
01:32:28,497 --> 01:32:31,417
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack.

992
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:35,588
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea.

993
01:32:35,796 --> 01:32:41,302
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon.

994
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:44,054
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike.

995
01:32:44,263 --> 01:32:46,348
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike.

996
01:32:46,557 --> 01:32:50,478
Once their Stealth bombers go up,
we will have no choice.

997
01:32:50,686 --> 01:32:52,521
That will be the sign.

998
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:55,107
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

999
01:32:55,316 --> 01:33:00,529
- Maybe we should...
- Bring our missiles to highest alert.

1000
01:33:00,738 --> 01:33:04,283
They'd be crazy to attack then.

1044
01:37:33,928 --> 01:37:38,265
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD.

1045
01:37:38,474 --> 01:37:41,977
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack.

1046
01:37:42,186 --> 01:37:45,356
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

1047
01:37:46,482 --> 01:37:49,819
Three or four hundred thousand.

1048
01:37:50,027 --> 01:37:53,906
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans...

1049
01:37:54,114 --> 01:37:56,283
...would be to cross a threshold.

1050
01:37:56,492 --> 01:38:02,957
They think we already have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

1051
01:38:03,457 --> 01:38:08,045
I cannot stop what I did not start.

1096
01:42:22,174 --> 01:42:23,926
Mr President.

1097
01:42:24,135 --> 01:42:27,221
Their Stealth bombers
have left Aviano.

1098
01:42:29,515 --> 01:42:32,518
That is the sign.

1099
01:42:32,726 --> 01:42:36,063
Shoot them down.

1100
01:42:40,109 --> 01:42:42,236
God protect us.

1141
01:45:45,753 --> 01:45:47,922
How close are the bombers?

1142
01:45:48,839 --> 01:45:54,929
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland.

1143
01:45:58,974 --> 01:46:03,729
Activate the missile regiments.

1168
01:47:55,424 --> 01:47:58,177
Type exactly what I say.

1183
01:48:37,091 --> 01:48:41,262
This is madness. He is CIA.

1184
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:44,682
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy.

1185
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:48,853
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

1190
01:49:20,009 --> 01:49:23,304
You see? He is wasting time.

1191
01:49:23,512 --> 01:49:25,764
We must launch now.
We have only moments.

1201
01:49:57,171 --> 01:49:58,714
They cut him off.

1202
01:49:59,715 --> 01:50:01,175
They are going to strike.

1203
01:50:01,383 --> 01:50:04,470
Prepare the launch orders now.
