1
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,422
[grunts]

2
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,097
[panting]

3
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,273
[wings flapping]

4
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,559
[man] Starling!

5
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,145
Starling.

6
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,775
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

7
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,486
[Southern accent] Thank you, sir.

8
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,742
[gunfire]

9
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,128
-[buzzer sounds]
-[gunfire continues]

10
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,725
[buzzer sounds]

11
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,438
[helicopter whirring]

12
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,815
[gunfire]

13
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,785
-Clarice.
-Hey.

14
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,047
Hey, I got right to the end.

15
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,898
[buzzer sounds]

16
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,608
[elevator bell dings]

17
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,791
[men chattering]

18
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,586
So there shouldn't be any problem
if you could –

19
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,171
-You looking for Crawford?
-Yes, sir.

20
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,632
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office.

21
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,925
Okay.

22
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,886
Then I think they were over into Flushing.

23
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,901
Starling. Clarice M.

24
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,237
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

25
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,073
Sorry to pull you off the course
on such short notice.

26
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,744
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
Top quarter of your class.

27
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,289
I hope so.
They haven't posted any grades yet.

28
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,125
A job's come up, and I thought about you.

29
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,878
Not a job really.
More of an interesting errand.

30
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,589
-Sit down.
-Yes, sir.

31
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,802
-I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
-Yeah.

32
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,971
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

33
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,682
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.

34
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,643
-I gave you an "A."
-A-minus, sir.

35
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,190
Let's see.
Double major – psych and criminology.

36
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,568
Graduated magna.
Summer internships at the Reitzinger Clinic.

37
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,196
It says here, when you graduate,

38
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,823
you wanna come to work for me
in behavioral science.

39
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,493
Yes. Very much, sir. Very much.

40
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,663
We're interviewing
all the serial killers now in custody

41
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,540
for a psycho-behavioral profile.

42
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,627
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

43
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,296
Most of them have been happy to talk to us.

44
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,423
You spook easily, Starling?

45
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,801
Not yet, sir.

46
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,720
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

47
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,306
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.

48
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,141
Who's the subject?

49
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,352
The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

50
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,813
"Hannibal the Cannibal."

51
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,524
I don't expect him to talk to you...

52
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,820
but I have to be able to say we tried.

53
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,031
So, if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting –

54
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,075
how's he look, how's his cell look.

55
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,787
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?

56
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,960
Here's a, uh, dossier on Lecter...

57
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,465
copy of our questionnaire,
and a special ID for you.

58
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,760
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.

59
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,345
Okay.

60
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:56,600
Um, excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?

61
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,853
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.

62
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,106
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

63
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,024
I wish there were.

64
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,943
I want your full attention, Starling.

65
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,112
Yes, sir.

66
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,573
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

67
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,202
Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over
all the physical procedures used with him.

68
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,456
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

69
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,584
And you're to tell him nothing personal,
Starling.

70
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,879
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

71
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,549
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

72
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,176
And what is that?

73
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,720
[man] Oh, he's a monster.

74
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,597
Pure psychopath.

75
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,266
So rare to capture one alive.

76
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,978
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

77
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,231
Well.

78
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,110
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but, I must say,

79
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,863
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

80
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,701
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

81
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,705
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

82
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,375
[chuckles] I'm sure this is a great town,
Dr. Chilton,

83
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,547
but, um, my instructions are to talk
to Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.

84
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,343
I see. Well, let's make this quick then.

85
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,261
We've tried to study him, of course,

86
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,223
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.

87
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,642
And, oh, my, does he hate us. [chuckling]

88
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,727
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

89
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,148
Crawford's very clever, isn't he, using you?

90
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,653
-What do you mean, sir?
-Pretty, young woman to turn him on.

91
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,781
I don't believe Lecter's
even seen a woman in eight years.

92
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:37,284
And, oh, are you ever his taste,
so to speak.

93
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,955
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.

94
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,666
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.

95
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,750
[man shouting]

96
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,588
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.

97
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,092
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.

98
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,219
No staples or paper clips in his paper.

99
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,763
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.

100
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,182
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.

101
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,351
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand, sir.

102
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,356
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

103
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,109
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,

104
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,195
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.

105
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,781
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.

106
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,617
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

107
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:26,083
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

108
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,086
His pulse never got above 85,

109
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,171
even when he ate her tongue.

110
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,383
-I keep him in here.
-Dr. Chilton.

111
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,926
[buzzer sounds]

112
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:40,306
Um, if Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

113
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,101
then, um, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.

114
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,186
What do you think?

115
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,647
[monitor beeping]

116
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,443
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

117
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,906
Yes, sir, but then I – I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

118
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,162
When she's finished, bring her out.

119
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,759
-[radio chatter]
-[printer clattering]

120
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,817
Hi. I'm Barney.

121
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,278
He told you don't get near the glass?

122
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,448
-Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.
-Mm-hmm.

123
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,659
Nice to meet you, Clarice.
You can hang your coat up here if you like.

124
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,661
Oh, thank you. I will.

125
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,708
He's past the others – the last cell.

126
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,502
You keep to the right.

127
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,962
[slams, lock turns]

128
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,466
-I put out a chair for you.
-Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.

129
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,304
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.

130
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,234
[man] Hi.

131
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,962
[hissing] I can smell your cunt!

132
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,479
-Good morning.
-Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

133
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,064
May I speak with you?

134
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,192
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?

135
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,861
I am, yes.

136
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,905
May I see your credentials?

137
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,116
Certainly.

138
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,374
Closer, please.

139
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,003
Closer.

140
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:36,315
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

141
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,276
I'm still in training at the academy.

142
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,363
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

143
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,201
Yes. I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

144
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,038
Maybe you can decide for yourself
whether or not I'm qualified enough to do that.

145
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,623
Mmm.

146
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,586
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

147
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,799
Sit. Please.

148
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,186
Now then, tell me,
what did Miggs say to you?

149
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,688
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

150
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,317
He hissed at you. What did he say?

151
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,655
He said, "I can smell your cunt."

152
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,240
I see.

153
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,618
I myself cannot.

154
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,831
[inhales, sniffing]

155
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,418
[gasps]

156
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,796
You use Evyan skin cream.

157
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,218
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

158
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,888
But not today.

159
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,767
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

160
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,352
Ah.

161
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,773
That is the Duomo seen from the Belvedere.

162
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,235
Do you know Florence?

163
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,196
All that detail just from memory, sir?

164
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,409
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

165
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:16,373
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

166
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,251
Oh, no, no, no, no.

167
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,086
You were doing fine.

168
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,298
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.

169
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:28,802
You had established trust
with the... embarrassing truth about Miggs.

170
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,848
And now this... ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

171
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,683
[clicking tongue]

172
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,268
It won't do.

173
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,687
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.

174
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,647
Either you will or you won't.

175
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,568
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

176
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,237
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.

177
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,324
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.

178
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,784
What a naughty boy he is.

179
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,538
Do you know why he's called "Buffalo Bill"?

180
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,000
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.

181
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,754
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

182
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,924
They said, "This one likes to skin his humps."

183
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,013
Why do you think he removes their skins,

184
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,806
Agent Starling?

185
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,017
Thrill me with your acumen.

186
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,561
It excites him.

187
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,648
Most serial killers keep some sort
of trophies from their victims.

188
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,567
-I didn't.
-No.

189
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,444
No, you ate yours.

190
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,282
You send that through now.

191
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,584
[tray slides open, closes]

192
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,099
Hmm.

193
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,394
[affecting Southern accent]
Oh, Agent Starling.

194
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,689
You think you can dissect me
with this blunt little tool?

195
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,401
No. I – I thought that your knowledge –

196
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,820
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

197
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,865
You know what you look like to me
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?

198
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,450
You look like a rube –

199
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,247
a well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.

200
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,417
Good nutrition's given you
some length of bone,

201
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,753
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,

202
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,839
are you, Agent Starling?

203
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:33,969
And that accent you've tried so desperately
to shed – pure West Virginia.

204
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,555
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?

205
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,181
Does he stink of the lamp?

206
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,143
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you –

207
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,813
all those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars

208
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,442
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,

209
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,070
getting all the way to the FBI.

210
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,367
You see a lot, Doctor.

211
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,871
But are you strong enough to point

212
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,498
that high-powered perception at yourself?

213
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,210
What about it? Why don't you –
Why don't you look at yourself

214
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,629
and write down what you see?

215
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,382
Or maybe you're afraid to.

216
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,764
[tray slams]

217
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,061
A census taker once tried to test me.

218
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,482
I ate his liver with some fava beans

219
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,734
and a nice Chianti.

220
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,195
[sucking teeth]

221
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,870
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

222
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,498
Fly, fly, fly.

223
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,501
[whispering] Fly, fly, fly.

224
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,294
Fly, fly, fly.

225
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,634
[man moaning]

226
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,471
[moaning loudly]

227
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,724
I bit my wrist so I could die.

228
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,311
[laughing] Look at the blood!

229
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,897
-[Gasps]
-Gotcha! [laughing]

230
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,149
Miggs! You stupid fuck!

231
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,902
[laughing]

232
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,487
I'm gonna kill him!

233
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,533
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!

234
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,953
I would not have had that happen to you.
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.

235
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,622
-Then do this test for me.
-No. But I will make you happy.

236
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,582
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

237
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,335
-And what is that, Doc –
-Advancement, of course. Listen carefully.

238
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,255
Look deep within yourself, Clarice Starling.

239
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,133
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine – M-O-F-E-T.

240
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:41,054
Go. I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon, even though he is crazy.

241
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,224
-Go now!
-[men shouting]

242
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,192
[door closes]

243
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,904
[gasps]

244
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,892
-Hi, Bill.
-[car door closes]

245
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,896
-Hey!
-Daddy!

246
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,063
Hey, Clarice.

247
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,567
Hello, my girl.

248
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,071
-Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
-No, angel. They all got away today.

249
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,656
Aw, shoot.

250
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,581
-[dog barks]
-[Clarice sobbing]

251
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,303
FBI! Hands up!

252
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,513
-Don't move!
-Turn around.

253
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,807
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

254
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,601
[handcuffs clicking]

255
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,979
-[gun clicks]
-You're dead, Starling.

256
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,148
-[buzzer sounds]
-Johnson, good job.

257
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,983
Good entry. Good commands.

258
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,027
-Starling, where's your danger area?
-In the corner, sir.

259
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,487
-Did you check the corner?
-No, sir.

260
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,780
That's the reason you're dead.

261
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,949
3-109.

262
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,619
3-109. Breaking doors or windows

263
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,829
to enter or exit.

264
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,998
Uh, Rule 4-048.

265
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,708
[machine clicks]

266
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,936
Clarice. Phone. It's the guru.

267
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
-Crawford?
-Yeah.

268
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,105
Thanks, Ardelia.

269
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,941
-Starling?
-Sir.

270
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,693
Miggs is dead.

271
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,487
Dead?

272
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,406
How?

273
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,742
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

274
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,453
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

275
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,582
Starling?

276
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,043
Yeah. I'm – I'm still here, sir.

277
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,088
I just –
I don't know how to feel about this.

278
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,092
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

279
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,345
Look, I know it got ugly today, but –

280
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,141
He mentioned a name at the end – a Mofet.

281
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,976
Any follow-up on her?

282
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,230
Uh, well, Lecter altered or destroyed most
of his patients' histories prior to capture,

283
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,232
so there's no record of anyone named Mofet.

284
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:45,196
But, um, I thought the "yourself" reference
was, uh, too hokey for Lecter.

285
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,033
So I figured, he's from Baltimore,

286
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:52,871
and I looked in the phone book,
and there's a Your Self Storage facility

287
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,498
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

288
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,713
[man] Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,

289
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,548
prepaid in full.

290
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,759
The contract was in the name

291
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,928
of a... Miss Hester Mofet.

292
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,515
So nobody's been in here since 1980?

293
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,851
Not to my knowledge.

294
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,772
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

295
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,649
[grunts]
Yes. I won't disturb anything. I promise.

296
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,985
I'll be outta here before you know it.

297
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,361
-[door clanking]
-Can I help you?

298
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,573
Yes, actually. I can't –

299
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,745
It's stuck.

300
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,581
You could return tomorrow with my son.

301
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,126
-What about him?
-[chuckles]

302
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,420
I would ask my driver to help you,

303
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,839
but he detests physical labor.

304
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,550
Right.

305
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,428
Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

306
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,243
[door creaking]

307
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,165
[grunting]

308
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,045
-[door creaking]
-Stuck.

309
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,506
-Hand me that flashlight, sir.
-[tire iron clatters]

310
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,643
Oh.

311
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,105
Um, if this door should fall down or –

312
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,190
[forced laugh] anything else,

313
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,153
uh, this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.

314
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:52,657
Now, they know that you're with me.
You call them if anything should happen.

315
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,242
Yes, Miss Starling.

316
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,622
-[fabric rips]
-Ow!

317
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,981
[door closes]

318
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,104
Clarice, I cleared the way for you.

319
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,648
-Watch yourself.
-Okay. Thanks.

320
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:34,193
"Hester Mofet."
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

321
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,239
"Hester Mofet." "The rest of me."

322
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,785
"Miss the Rest of Me."
Meaning that you rented that garage?

323
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,490
Thank you.

324
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,991
Your bleeding has stopped.

325
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,327
[TV: no audible dialogue]

326
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,037
How did you –

327
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,415
It's nothing.

328
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,751
It's just a scratch.

329
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,754
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

330
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,091
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

331
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,009
Why, do you know something about him?

332
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:44,013
I might if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me.

333
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:47,475
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?
You wanted me to find him.

334
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,562
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.

335
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,942
A former patient of mine
whose romantic attachments ran

336
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,736
to, shall we say, the exotic.

337
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,947
I did not kill him, I assure you.

338
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,533
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him

339
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:06,119
after he'd missed three appointments.

340
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,414
But... if you didn't kill him,
then who did, sir?

341
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,834
Who can say? Best thing for him really.

342
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,336
His therapy was going nowhere.

343
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:19,215
His dress, uh, makeup –

344
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,008
Raspail was a transvestite?

345
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,553
In life? Oh, no.

346
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,930
Garden-variety manic-depressive.

347
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,849
Tedious. Very tedious.

348
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,102
No, no. Just think of him
as a kind of experiment,

349
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,856
a fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

350
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,358
How did you feel when you saw him,
Clarice?

351
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:42,572
Scared at first, then... exhilarated.

352
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,366
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?

353
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,286
Apparently he likes you, and you like him too.

354
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,955
I never thought about it.

355
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,083
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?

356
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,710
True, he is much older,

357
00:29:55,794 --> 00:30:00,673
but do you think he visualizes scenarios,
exchanges, fucking you?

358
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,468
[scoffs]

359
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,261
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.

360
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,848
And frankly, it's – it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.

361
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,643
Not anymore.

00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,440

363
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,652
Thank you, Barney.

364
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,533
What happened to your drawings?

365
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,787
Punishment, you see. For Miggs.

366
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,581
Just like that gospel program.

they'll turn the volume way up.

368
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,171
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

369
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,216
What did you mean by "transformation,"
Doctor?

370
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,977
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice...

371
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,315
and I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

372
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,485
What I want is a view.

373
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:06,489
I want a window
where I can see a tree or even water.

374
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,326
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.

375
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,912
What did you mean by "fledgling killer"?

376
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,872
Are you saying that he's killed again?

377
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:18,376
I'm offering you
a psychological profile on Buffalo Bill

378
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,711
based on the case evidence.

379
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,344
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

380
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,270
You know who he is, don't you?

381
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,982
Tell me who decapitated your patient, Doctor.

382
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,901
All good things to those who wait.

383
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,528
I've waited, Clarice.

384
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,447
But how long can you
and ol' Jackie boy wait?

385
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:54,245
Our little Billy must already
be searching for that next special lady.

[Crawford] Keeps 'em alive for three days.
We don't know why.

There's no evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

is postmortem.

The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,943
That's Frederica Bimmel, the first one.

446
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,071
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

447
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,949
so actually she was the third girl found.

Uh, serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.

Um, he's not a drifter.

459
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,082
He's got his own... house somewhere,
not an apartment.

460
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,045
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy.

and he's getting better at his work.

Not bad, Starling. Questions?

468
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:06,450
Yes, sir. Um, you haven't mentioned anything
about the information contained in my report

or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.

00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,053
Okay, Starling.

517
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,434
Bill.

518
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,078
Star-shaped contact entrance wound

519
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,330
over the, uh, sternum.

520
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,501
Um, muzzle stamp at the top.

521
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,837
-[Akin] Wrongful death.
-Wrongful death.

522
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,213
[camera shutter clicks, whirs]

523
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,091
[Akin] She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.

524
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:00,012
Well, I-I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help ya.

525
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,141
-Lord Almighty.
-[shutter clicks, whirs]

526
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,727
[shutter continues clicking]

527
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,895
[Crawford] What else do you see, Starling?

528
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,524
Well, she's not local.

529
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,278
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's, uh –

530
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,574
Uh, glitter nail polish.
It looks like town to me.

531
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,624
Two of her fingernails are broken off,
and there's, uh –

532
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,836
there's dirt or grit under them.

533
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,297
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.

534
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,381
[clicks, whirs]

535
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:39,176
[Crawford] Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them to Missing Persons.

536
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,761
Right.

537
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,605
[Terry] Let's do another.

538
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,651
[clicks, whirs]

539
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,366
She's got something in her throat.

540
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,702
When a body comes out of the water,

541
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,705
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.

542
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,105
[air hissing]

543
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,115
What is that, some kind of seed pod?

544
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,159
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

545
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,663
But there's no way that could get
way down in there like that.

546
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,165
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

547
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,920
She'll be easier to print when we turn her over.

548
00:45:57,004 --> 00:46:00,298
-Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
-Yes, sir, I will.

549
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,096
Ooh, Jack.

550
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,515
-What do you make of these?
-Hmm.

551
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,685
Different configuration than the other victims.
Get close-ups.

552
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,645
[Clarice]
The victim's skin removed at this time

553
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:16,857
in two large diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.

554
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,193
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

555
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:23,363
approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.

556
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,865
[Crawford] Starling.

557
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,369
When – When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

558
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,455
that really burned you, didn't it?

559
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,332
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

560
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,504
It matters, Mr. Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

561
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,090
-It matters.
-Point taken.

562
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,682
Ligature marks found around the wrists,

563
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,726
not around the ankles.

564
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,562
This would indicate that the skinning
was postmortem.

565
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,440
[elevator bell dings]

566
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,547
-[man] Time, Pilch. My move.
-[Pilch] No fair. You lured him with produce.

567
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,008
Tough noogies. Still my turn.

568
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,218
[blows]

569
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,011
Nice and slow, baby.

570
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,805
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

571
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,560
Of course it counts. How do you play?

572
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,687
Agent Starling?

573
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,483
[man 1] Where the heck did this come from?

574
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,610
It's practically mush.

575
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,904
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.

576
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,156
The body was in the Elk River
in West Virginia.

577
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:51,409
-It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
-I'm afraid I can't tell you any more about that.

578
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,827
We heard about it on the radio.

579
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,205
You mean this is, like,
a clue from a real murder case?

580
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,291
-Cool!
-Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

581
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,128
A Sphingid ceratomia maybe.

582
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,297
Boy, he's a big sucker.

583
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:09,052
Okay. Let's check morphology.

584
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,685
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

585
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,230
What do you do when you're not detecting,
Agent Starling?

586
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,484
[chuckles]
Try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

587
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,987
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?

588
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,657
The amusing house wine?

589
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,701
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

590
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,412
-Yes.
-Gotcha.

591
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,831
-What do you got, Roden?
-Agent Starling.

592
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,543
Meet Mr. Acherontia styx.

593
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,044
Weird.

594
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,172
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

595
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,175
-And where does it come from?
-That's what's strange.

596
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,927
-They only live in Asia.
-Asia?

597
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,805
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.

598
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,142
Uh, somebody grew this guy.
Fed him honey and nightshade.

599
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:58,727
Kept him warm.

600
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,313
Somebody loved him.

601
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,572
[rock music playing, faint]

602
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,037
[woman, faint] Please.

603
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,840
Hello?

604
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,093
[rock continues]

605
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,642
[woman] Where are you?

606
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,061
Let me out of here!

607
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,689
[singing along softly]

608
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,653
-Hey!
-[dog barking]

609
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,697
-Please help me!
-[dog continues barking]

610
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,993
Someone help me! Please!

611
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:59,746
Why won't you answer me? Please!

612
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,457
[TV: program theme]

613
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,002
-Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucci.
-I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

614
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,214
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.

615
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:13,593
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

616
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,220
listed first as a missing person,

617
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:19,933
is now believed to have been kidnapped
by the serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill.

618
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,560
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse –

619
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,813
-Thank you.
-has been identified – sliced up the back –

620
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:28,400
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.

621
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,111
Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,
is the only daughter

622
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,698
of US Senator Ruth Martin,
the Republican junior senator from Tennessee.

623
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:38,451
And while her kidnapping is not at this point
considered to be politically motivated,

624
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,705
nevertheless, it has stirred the government
to its highest levels.

625
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,541
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Stowe, Vermont,

626
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:48,586
the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "intensely concerned."

627
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,714
-Just moments ago, Senator Martin –
-Excuse me.

628
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,841
taped this dramatic personal plea.

629
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,761
[Senator Martin] I'm speaking now
to the person who's holdin' my daughter.

630
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,182
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

631
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,185
Talk to her and you'll see.

632
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,647
You have the power.

633
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,733
You are in charge.

634
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,613
I know you can feel love and compassion.

635
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:21,077
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

636
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,872
that you can be merciful as well as strong,

637
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,958
that you're big enough to treat Catherine

638
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,461
better than the world has treated you.

639
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,838
You have that power.

640
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,466
Please.

641
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,593
My daughter is Catherine.

642
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:38,887
-[Ardelia] Boy, that's smart.
-Release her unharmed.

643
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:42,807
-Jesus, that's really smart.
-[man] She keeps repeating the name.

644
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:46,102
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

645
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,812
it's harder to tear her up.

646
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,190
Please, release my little girl.

647
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,483
[sirens wailing]

648
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,444
What you're doing, Miss Starling,
is coming into my hospital

649
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:59,115
to conduct an interview and refusing to
share information with me for the third time.

650
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,661
Sir, I told you this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

651
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:07,290
-He is my patient. I have rights.
-I understand that, sir.

652
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:11,878
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

653
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:15,298
This is the number
for the US Attorney's office.

654
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,843
Please, either you discuss this with him
or you let me do my job.

655
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:20,929
Do you understand?

656
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,394
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill

657
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,772
in time to save Catherine Martin...

658
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,317
the senator promises you a transfer

659
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,613
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby.

660
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,491
Maximum security still applies, of course.

661
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,202
You'd have reasonable access to books.

662
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,413
Best of all though,

663
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,332
one week of the year,

664
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,376
you get to leave the hospital

665
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,586
and go here.

666
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,258
Plum Island.

667
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,846
Every day of that week,
you may walk on the beach,

668
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,557
you may swim in the ocean –
for up to one hour –

669
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:09,102
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.

670
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,437
-[exhales]
-And there you have it.

671
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:17,735
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

672
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,823
Copy of the senator's offer.

673
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,243
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

674
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,704
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

675
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,706
[tray clangs]

676
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:42,010
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."

677
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,723
Sounds charming.

678
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,227
That's only part of the island.
There's a very – very nice beach.

679
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,605
Terns nest there. There's beautiful –

680
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,940
Terns? Mm.

681
00:53:56,901 --> 00:54:00,069
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us too.

682
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,323
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

683
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,159
Not about this case though.
About yourself.

684
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,329
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

685
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:15,376
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

686
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,962
Go, Doctor.

687
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,758
What is your worst memory of childhood?

688
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,803
Death of my father.

689
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,349
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.

690
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,435
He was the town marshal, and...

691
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,355
one night he

692
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,400
surprised two burglars coming out
of the back of a drugstore.

693
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,737
They shot him.

694
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,156
Was he killed outright?

695
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,285
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

696
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,581
My mother died when I was very young, so –

697
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,666
[exhales]

698
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,126
My father had become the whole world to me,

699
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,671
and, uh, when he left me, I had nothing.

700
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,381
I was 10 years old.

701
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,550
You're very frank, Clarice.

702
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,722
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

703
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,102
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

704
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,691
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

705
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,779
-Yes.
-Big through the hips?

706
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,407
-Roomy?
-They all were.

707
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,492
What else?

708
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,329
She had an object deliberately inserted
into her throat.

709
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:38,084
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

710
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,877
Was it a butterfly?

711
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,339
Yes. A moth.

712
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,761
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

713
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,056
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

714
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,394
The significance of the moth is change.

715
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,897
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa...

716
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,900
and, from thence, into beauty.

717
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,279
Our Billy wants to change too.

718
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,742
There's no correlation in the literature
between transsexualism and violence.

719
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,703
-Transsexuals are very passive.
-Clever girl.

720
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,665
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him. Do you realize that?

721
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,834
No. Tell me why.

722
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:22,712
After your father's murder, you were orphaned.

723
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,380
What happened next?

724
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,472
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

725
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:36,684
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

726
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,061
They had a ranch.

727
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,063
Was it a cattle ranch?

728
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,190
Sheep and horses.

729
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,983
How long did you live there?

730
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,110
Two months.

731
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,737
Why so briefly?

732
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,405
I ran away.

733
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,449
Why, Clarice?

734
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,951
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?

735
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,953
Did he sodomize you?

736
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,832
No. He was a very decent man.

737
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,503
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

738
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,840
Billy is not a real transsexual.

739
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,009
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

740
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,137
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

741
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,681
You said I was very close
to the way we would catch him.

742
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,391
What did you mean, Doctor?

743
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,894
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery –

744
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:24,398
Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota,
and Columbus Medical Center.

745
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,693
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment

746
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,445
at one or all of them

747
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,781
and been rejected.

748
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,783
On what basis would they reject him?

749
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,328
[Lecter's voice]
Look for severe childhood disturbances

750
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,497
associated with violence.

751
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,542
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

752
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:46,796
He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.

753
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,424
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

754
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:53,261
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual.

755
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:57,265
But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage

756
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,350
and more terrifying.

757
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,687
[dog growls]

758
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,399
It rubs lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

759
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,402
[gasping] Mister, my family will pay cash.

760
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,738
Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
they'll pay it.

761
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:18,119
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.

762
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,787
[barks]

763
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,456
Yes, it will, Precious.
It will get the hose.

764
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,835
[whimpering] Okay. Okay. Okay.

765
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,172
Okay. Okay.

766
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,756
Okay.

767
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,928
Mister, if you let me go, I won't –
I won't press charges.

768
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,097
I promise.

769
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,892
See, my mom is a real important woman.

770
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,102
I guess you already know that.

771
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,813
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

772
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:50,693
[sobbing]
Please! Please! I want to go home.

773
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,821
I want to go home, please!

774
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:54,989
Please.

775
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,241
It places the lotion in the basket.

776
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:02,246
I want to see my mommy! Please –

777
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,167
I want to see my – I want – [sobbing]

778
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,503
I want – I want to see – [mouths words]

779
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,966
-Put the fucking lotion in the basket!
-[Precious barking]

780
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,551
[gasping]

781
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:26,020
[screaming]

782
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,901
[screaming continues]

783
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,987
[mock screaming]

784
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:42,161
[mock screaming]

785
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,545
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

786
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,048
[chuckles] No, I don't think so.

787
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,010
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

788
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,763
She never heard of any deal with you.

789
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,724
[chuckling] They scammed you, Hannibal.

790
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,852
Stand outside.

791
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,814
And shut the door.

792
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,066
-Barney.
-Mm-hmm.

793
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:17,780
[door closing]

794
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:22,285
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.

795
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,577
I designed it.

796
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:27,123
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.

797
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:33,087
Identify Buffalo Bill by name,
and if the girl is found in time,

798
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,797
Senator Martin will have you transferred

799
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,091
to Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.

800
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,094
Answer me, Hannibal.

801
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,642
You answer me now, or by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

802
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:50,938
Who is Buffalo Bill?

803
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,899
His first name is Louis.

804
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,321
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

805
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,656
And I have a few conditions of my own.

806
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,453
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

807
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,957
[man over phone] Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

808
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,625
Transferred?

809
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:16,130
Did you have a trainee make some sort of
phony offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

810
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,174
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.

811
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:22,595
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

812
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,930
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.

813
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:28,726
[sirens wailing]

814
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,999
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.

815
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,877
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.

816
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,213
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.

817
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,965
You be a gentleman,
you're gonna get three hots and a cot.

818
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,887
Sir, if you'll sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

819
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,183
Where is it?

820
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,228
Here, sir. Use mine.

821
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:20,653
[exhaling]

822
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:03,612
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

823
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:10,077
Dr. Lecter.

824
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,873
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

825
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,625
You'll want to read it before I sign.

826
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:24,633
I won't waste your time or Catherine's time
bargaining for petty privileges.

827
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,219
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford

828
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,096
have wasted far too much time already.

829
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,141
I only pray
they haven't doomed the poor girl.

830
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,979
Let me help you now,
and I will trust you when it is all over.

831
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,898
You have my word. Paul?

832
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,695
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

833
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,072
I met him just once.

834
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:52,286
He was referred to me in April or May 1980
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.

835
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,580
They were lovers, you see.

836
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,959
But Raspail had become very frightened.

837
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,713
Apparently, Louis had murdered a transient

838
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,342
and done things with the skin.

839
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,137
We need his address
and a physical description.

840
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,890
Tell me, Senator,

841
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,185
did you nurse Catherine yourself?

842
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,854
-What?
-Did you breast-feed her?

843
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,815
-Wait a minute.
-Yes, I did.

844
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,402
-Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
-You son of a bitch!

845
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,740
[Lecter] Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.

846
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:34,954
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

847
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,749
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

848
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,212
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.

849
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,424
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.
He'd be about 35 now.

850
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,969
He said he lived in Philadelphia
but may have lied.

851
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,513
That's all I can remember, Mom.

852
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,307
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.

853
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,187
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.

854
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,108
Love your suit.

855
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,529
[Chilton] I can tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening

856
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:12,992
with Senator Ruth Martin, Dr. Lecter
agreed to assist in the investigation

857
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:16,161
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.

858
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,414
-How do you fit in, sir?
-It's through my unique insight

859
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,541
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.

860
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,834
And Buffalo Bill's real name?

861
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,796
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.

862
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,465
-Can you give us more information?
-My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.

863
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,092
-How do you spell that?
-That's C-H –

864
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,178
Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?

865
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,931
Uh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.

866
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,102
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.

867
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,729
I understand, sir.

868
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,486
Log in and check your weapon.

869
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,240
[Krendler]
I can't take all the credit for myself.

870
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,034
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

871
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,078
people at the FBI,
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.

872
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,706
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.

873
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,168
-Excuse me, folks. I have to catch a flight.
-[reporters clamoring]

874
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:06,795
[phone rings]

875
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,798
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.

876
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,810
-[officer] Is it true what they're saying?
-Huh?

877
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:25,356
He's some kind of vampire.

878
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,694
-They don't have a name for what he is.
-[elevator bell dings]

879
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:32,613
You do know the rules, ma'am?

880
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,658
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

881
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,162
Go ahead.

882
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,076
Good evening, Clarice.

883
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,247
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

884
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,252
Just until you get your view.

885
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,088
How very thoughtful.

886
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,467
Or did Jack Crawford
send you for one last wheedle

887
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,720
before you're both booted off the case?

888
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,139
No, I came because I wanted to.

889
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,521
People will say we're in love.

890
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,150
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

891
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,777
Anthrax Island.

892
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,947
That was an especially nice touch,
Clarice.

893
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,532
Yours?

894
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,325
Yes.

895
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:01,910
Yeah.

896
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,079
That was good.

897
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,876
Pity about poor Catherine though.
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

898
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,336
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

899
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,882
Louis Friend? [scoffs]

900
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:18,135
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

901
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:22,473
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

902
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,309
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.

903
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,311
Please continue now.

904
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,189
I've read the case files. Have you?

905
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,109
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.

906
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:37,237
-Then tell me how.
-First principles, Clarice.

907
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,072
Simplicity.

908
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,616
Read Marcus Aurelius.

909
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,869
Of each particular thing, ask,
what is it in itself?

910
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,704
What is its nature?

911
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:50,542
What does he do, this man you seek?

912
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,295
He kills women.

913
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,423
No. That is incidental.

914
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,259
What is the first
and principal thing he does?

915
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:02,554
What needs does he serve by killing?

916
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,056
Anger.

917
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:10,479
Um. . . social acceptance
and, um, sexual frustration, sir.

918
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,232
No. He covets.

919
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,235
That is his nature.

920
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,071
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

921
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,865
Do we seek out things to covet?

922
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,077
Make an effort to answer now.

923
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,913
No. We just –

924
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,250
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.

925
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:34,670
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

926
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,799
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?

927
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,844
All right, yes. Now please tell me how.

928
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,220
No.

929
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:48,892
It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.
You don't have any more vacations to sell.

930
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,645
Why did you leave that ranch?

931
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,899
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.

932
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:59,236
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we, Clarice?

933
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,238
This is all the time you'll ever have.

934
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,699
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five –

935
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:07,160
No! I will listen now.

936
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,541
After your father's murder, you were orphaned.
You were 10 years old.

937
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,711
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

938
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,379
And?

939
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,842
And one morning, I just ran away.

940
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:26,013
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off?

941
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,931
You started at what time?

942
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,975
Early. Still dark.

943
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,895
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream?

944
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,062
What was it?

945
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,357
I heard a strange noise.

946
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,985
What was it?

947
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,653
It was. . .

948
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,323


screaming.

949
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,785
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.

950
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,829
What did you do?

951
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:55,083
I went downstairs, outside.

952
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,546
I crept up into the barn house.

953
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:03,342
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

954
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,553
What did you see, Clarice?

955
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,180
What did you see?

956
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:10,849
Lambs.

957
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,769
They were screaming. [inhales]

958
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:17,105
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

959
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,941
And they were screaming.

960
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,569
And you ran away?

961
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:23,654
No.

962
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,406
First I tried to free them. I –

963
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,618
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

964
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,871
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

965
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,540
But you could, and you did, didn't you?

966
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:37,918
Yes.

967
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,295
I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

968
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,214
Where were you going, Clarice?

969
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,677
I don't know. I didn't have any food,
any water, and it was very cold.

970
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,970
It was very cold.

971
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,306
I thought –

972
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,559
I thought if I could save just one, but. . .

973
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,313
he was so heavy.

974
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,024
He was so heavy.

975
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:03,110
[wind whistling]

976
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:10,158
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

977
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:17,374
Rancher was so angry, he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.

978
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,252
I never saw the ranch again.

979
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:24,047
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

980
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,551
They killed him.

981
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,845
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

982
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,722
Wake up in the dark

983
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,350
and hear the screaming of the lambs.

984
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:36,935
Yes.

985
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:42,899
And you think if you saved poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

986
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,277
You think, if Catherine lives,

987
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,696
you won't wake up in the dark ever again. . .

988
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,616
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

989
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,746
I don't know. I don't know.

990
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,000
Thank you, Clarice.

991
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,085
Thank you.

992
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,837
Tell me his name, Doctor.

993
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,047
[Lecter inhales]

994
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,631
[door opens]

995
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,180
[clicks tongue] Dr. Chilton, I presume?

996
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:15,766
I think you know each other.

997
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,893
[footsteps approaching]

998
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,227
Okay.

999
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,897
-[agent] We found her.
-Let's go.

1000
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,899
It's your turn, Doctor.

1001
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,568
-Out.
-Tell me his name.

1002
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,362
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
Have to put you on a plane.

1003
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,947
[Boyle] Come on now.

1004
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,616
Brave Clarice.

1005
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:36,912
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

1006
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,997
Tell me his name, Doctor.

1007
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,415
Clarice!

1008
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,210
Your case file.

1009
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:46,296
Hey.

1010
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,008
Good-bye, Clarice.

1011
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:54,346
[Boyle, guard grunting, muttering]

1012
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:01,436
[police radio chatter]

1013
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:34,052
[classical piano]

1014
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,983
[footsteps approaching]

1015
01:14:56,117 --> 01:14:57,909
Ready when you are, Doc.

1016
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,078
Just another minute, please.

1017
01:15:09,255 --> 01:15:11,882
Son of a bitch demanded a second dinner.

1018
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,758
Lamb chops. Extra rare.

1019
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:18,346
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

1020
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,265
[guard chuckles]

1021
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:28,398
[classical piano continues]

1022
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,536
Good evening, gentlemen.

1023
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,830
Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.

1024
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:45,999
-Same drill as before, please.
-Mm-hmm.

1025
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,883
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

1026
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:12,943
[Pembry] Okay.

1027
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,701
-[Boyle] Hand me that, would you?
-Uh-huh.

1028
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:28,083
Thanks.

1029
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,588
[Lecter] Mind the drawings, please.

1030
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,218
Thank you.

[Pembry groaning]

1044
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,376
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

[people chattering]

1046
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:46,262
[officer] What is this shit?

1047
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,266
Did somebody go up on five?

1048
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,727
No. Nobody went up.

1049
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:55,647
-Call Pembry. Ask him to tell –

1050

1056
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,038
Bobby, get the vest.

1057
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,331
Right, Sarge.

1060
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,591
Seal off a 10-block radius.

1061
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,428
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance, double quick.

1062
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:27,804
We're goin' up.

Oh, God!

1068
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:24,360
Go.

1069
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,286

-Clear.

1070

-[Jacobs] Clear.
-[officer] Clear!

1072

Lecter's gone, Sarge.

[Tate] Prisoner is missing.

1074
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:46,633
-Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
-Repeat, Lecter's missing and armed.

1075
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,885
He's stripped the bed.

1076
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:51,304
Might be making a rope. Check all windows.

1077
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:54,349
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

1078
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,017
-[wheezing]
-He's alive.

1079
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,187
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!

1080
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:02,190
Get ahold of him where
you can feel his hands, son. Talk to him.

1081
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,317
What do I say?

1082
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,903
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!

1083
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,573
[Tate] Lecter's missing and armed.

1084
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,117
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?

1085
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,872
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one round.
There's a chance Lecter was hit.

1086
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:20,250
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.

1087
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,336
You're doing a good job.
Oh, you look real good there.

01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,193

-Yeah.

1093
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,582
Lookin' good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.

1094
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,084
You're doin' just fine.
You're doin' all right. That's right.

1095
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,420
-Okay, I need that IV now!
-Lactated Ringer's.

1096
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,006
Can we get the strap?
Buzz, where's the fuckin' oxygen?

1097
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,175
Lookin' good, buddy. That's right.
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

1099
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,388
We're losin' him. Downstairs, quickly!

1103
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,276
-[monitor beeping]
-[man on radio] CP to Tate.

1104
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,945
Uh, roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

1105
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:33,698
I'm on the elevator bringin' Pembry down.

1106
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,284
He seems to be hangin' on.

1107
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,870
Top three floors secured.

1108
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,497
Main stairwell secured.

1109
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,459
We think he's on two.

1110
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,141
[lieutenant on radio]
Tate? You still with me?

1111
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,520
Uh, we're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.

1112
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,397
That's all for now. Over.

1113
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:08,733
[elevator bell dings]

1114
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,127
He's on the roof of the elevator.

1115
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,507
Okay, guys.

1116
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:53,111
I see him. There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

1117
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,739
-One warning. We need him alive.
-Got it.

1118
01:23:57,825 --> 01:23:59,117
Lecter?

1119
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,910
Put your hands on your head.

1120
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:04,914
One in the leg.

1121
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:17,427
No movement.

1122
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,180
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.

1123
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,474
We're opening the hatch.

1124
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,643
Watch his hands.

1125
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,812
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

1126
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,731
-Affirm?
-Got it.

1127
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:56,007
[siren blaring]

1128
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,217
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.

1129
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,928
We're inbound
with a 50-year-old male police officer

1130
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,764
with severe facial lacerations.

1131
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,517
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity, but he's postictal now.

1132
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:07,518
Copy.

1133
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:10,480
Uh, vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

1134
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,107
- Ninety?
-Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 84.

1135
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,234
We've got him on
lactated Ringer's running,

1136
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,196
and, uh – and the, uh, patient
is on 10 liters of oxygen.

1137
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,782
Watch it!

1138
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:28,247
[Ardelia] They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.

1139
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,540
Crew was dead.

1140
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,585
He killed a tourist too.

1141
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,670
Got his clothes, cash.

1142
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:36,964
By now he could be anywhere.

1143
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,382
He won't come after me.

1144
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,967
-Oh, really?
-He won't.

1145
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:44,430
I can't explain it.
He – He would consider that rude.

1146
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:47,475
[scoffs] It's over. She's dead.

1147
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,560
It's not your fault it worked out like this.

1148
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,564
Lecter said everything we need to catch him
with is right here in these pages.

1149
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:56,067
Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.

1150
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,027
He's here, Ardelia.

1151
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,094
[sniffs]

1152
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,100
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

1153
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:36,065
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random?

1154
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:40,069
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.
Ta, Hannibal Lecter."

1155
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:42,780
"Desperately random." What does he mean?

1156
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:46,325
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

1157
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:50,538
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would've nailed it.

1158
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,707
They were even found in random order.

1159
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:55,334
Random because of the one girl.

1160
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:56,919
The one he weighted down.

1161
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,714
-Oh, Frederica Bimmel.
-Right.

1162
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:03,301
Yeah, from Belvedere, Ohio.

1163
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:07,138
First girl taken. Third body found. Why?

1164
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:09,348
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.

1165
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:12,852
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

1166
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,312
Simplicity.

1167
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:17,481
What does this guy do? He covets.

1168
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,818
How do we first start to covet?

1169
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,695
We covet what we see –

1170
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:24,030
Every day.

1171
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,910
-Hot damn, Clarice.
-He knew her.

1172
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,238
-Mr. Bimmel?
-That's me.

1173
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,741
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.

1174

[door opens, closes]

1175
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:57,331
[Clarice] I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.

1176
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,668
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

1177
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:03,087
Police been back here
so many times already.

1178
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:08,009
Frederica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

1179
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:12,138
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.

1180
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:18,602
Her bedroom's how she left it. Upstairs.

1181
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,521
Door to the left.

[bird wings flapping]

1188
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:08,105
[Clarice] He's making himself
a woman suit, Mr. Crawford,

1189
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,440
out of real women!

1190
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,193
And he can sew, this guy.
He-He's very skilled.

1191
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,695
-He's a tailor or a dressmaker or –
-[Crawford] Starling –

1192
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,905
That's why they're all big.

1193
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,574
He has to keep them alive
so he can starve them a while,

1194
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:19,950
so he can loosen their skin –

1195
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:24,330
Starling, Starling, we know who he is and
where he is. We're on our way right now.

1196
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,750
-Where?
-Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

1197
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:31,128
-Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.
-Oh, that's –

1198
