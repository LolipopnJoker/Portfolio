1
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:57,551
Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, far away,

2
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:02,055
the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.

3
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:05,809
And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...

4
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,895
until the sun went down

5
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,024
and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment

6
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:15,154
that took hold each and every night.

7
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:20,283
Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy godmother

8
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:23,368
who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,

9
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:27,248
there to await the kiss...
of the handsome Prince Charming.

10
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:33,379
It was he who would chance
the perilous journey

11
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,132
through blistering cold
and scorching desert

12
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:38,508
traveling for many days and nights,

13
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:40,762
risking life and limb

14
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:44,348
to reach the Dragon's keep.

15
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:51,313
For he was the bravest,

16
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:54,024
and most handsome...

17
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:58,779
in all the land.

18
00:01:58,862 --> 00:02:01,532
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:05,911
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:11,750
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:16,381
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:19,508
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her...

23
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:21,719
What?

24
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:25,390
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!

25
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:28,517
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,854
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

27
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,873
# So she said
what's the problem, baby?

28
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,707
# What's the problem?
I don't know

29
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,792
# Well, maybe I'm in love

30
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,338
# Think about it
every time I think 'bout it

31
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,756
# Can't stop thinking 'bout it

32
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:01,967
# How much longer
will it take to cure this?

33
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,677
# Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it

34
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:06,098
# If it's love, love

35
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:08,474
# Makes me wanna turn around
and face me

36
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:11,143
# But I don't know nothing
'bout love

37
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:13,021
# Oh, come on, come on

38
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:15,315
# Turn a little faster

39
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:16,900
# Come on, come on

40
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,067
# The world will follow after

41
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,652
# Come on, come on

42
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:25,408
# Everybody's after love

43
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,415
# So I said
I'm a snowball running

44
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:37,337
# Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love

45
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:40,840
# Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight

46
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:42,966
# Shimmering love

47
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:44,719
# Well, baby, I surrender

48
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:46,847
# To the strawberry ice cream

49
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,889
# Never ever end of all this love

50
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,893
# Well, I didn't mean to do it

51
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:55,271
# But there's no escaping your love

52
00:03:56,022 --> 00:04:00,192
# These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone

53
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,402
# Never alone, no, no

54
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,071
# Come on, come on

55
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,075
# Jump a little higher

56
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:07,200
# Come on, come on

57
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:09,536
# If you feel a little lighter

58
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,786
# Come on, come on

59
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,166
# We were once upon a time in love

60
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:16,251
Hyah!

61
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:21,213
# We're accidentally in love

62
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,092
# Accidentally in love

63
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:39,566
# Accidentally in love

64
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:41,109
# Accidentally

65
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:44,487
# I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love

66
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,447
# I'm in love, I'm in love

67
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:50,077
# Accidentally in love

68
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:53,914
# I'm in love

69
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,749
# I'm in love #

70
00:04:55,832 --> 00:04:57,959
lt's so good to be home!

71
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,755
Just you and me and...

72
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:11,305
- # Two can be as bad as one... #
- Donkey?

73
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:15,309
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

74
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,686
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

75
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:22,025
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?

76
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:24,277
Donkey, what are you doing here?

77
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,404
Taking care of your love nest for you.

78
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:30,785
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail
and watering the plants?

79
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:33,870
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- l don't have any fish.

80
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:37,039
You do now. l call that one Shrek
and the other Fiona.

81
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:40,044
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

82
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,837
Look at the time.
l guess you'd better be going.

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,841
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

84
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:51,097
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be
getting home to Dragon?

85
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,307
Oh, yeah, that.

86
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:56,976
l don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.

87
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,728
l thought l'd move in with you.

88
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:01,565
You know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

89
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:04,443
But Fiona and l are married now.

90
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:07,820
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

91
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,992
Just with each other.

92
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:14,494
Alone.

93
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:17,414
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

94
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:20,209
l will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

95
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,003
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

96
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:23,503
You're bothering me.

97
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:28,007
Oh, OK. All right, cool. l guess...

98
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:31,344
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch
a tournament, anyway, so...

99
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:36,225
Maybe l'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

100
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:42,399
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?

101
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,400
Oh.

102
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,484
l think l remember.

103
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:50,196
Donkey!

104
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:53,366
l know, l know! Alone!
l'm going! l'm going.

105
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,494
What do you want me
to tell these other guys?

106
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,631
Enough, Reggie.

107
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:14,345
''Dearest Princess Fiona.

108
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:18,599
''You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

109
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:23,356
''for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

110
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,565
''at which time the King

111
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,696
''will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your...''

112
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,908
uh... ''Prince Charming.

113
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,618
''Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away.

114
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:40,163
''aka Mom and Dad.''

115
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,581
Mom and Dad?

116
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:45,043
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can l come?

117
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,920
- We're not going.
- What?

118
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:49,964
l mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

119
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:53,052
shocked to see you like this?

120
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:55,555
Well, they might be
a bit surprised.

121
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:58,808
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

122
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,227
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

123
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,269
Yeah, right.

124
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:05,105
Somehow l don't think l'll be welcome
at the country club.

125
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:06,982
Stop it.
They're not like that.

126
00:08:07,065 --> 00:08:10,568
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

127
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:14,074
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

128
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:16,198
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?

129
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:19,161
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

130
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:23,332
Oh, great.
Now l need their blessing?

131
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,876
lf you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

132
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:28,003
Who says l want
to be part of this family?

133
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:31,090
You did!
When you married me!

134
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:33,218
Well, there's some fine print for you!

135
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:36,302
So that's it. You won't come?

136
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:41,641
Trust me. lt's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!

137
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:46,146
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!

138
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:51,652
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

139
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,781
Hey, wait for me. Oof!

140
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,791
# Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!

141
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,335
# Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!

142
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:11,714
# Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!

143
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:16,176
# Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!

144
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,262
# Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!

145
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:19,929
# Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!

146
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,557
# Rawhide! #
Yee-haw!

147
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,691
- Are we there yet?
- No.

148
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,781
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

149
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,077
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.

150
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,914
- Are we there yet?
- No!

151
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:46,999
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

152
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,376
- Really?
- No!

153
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:49,918
- Are we there yet?
- No!

154
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,795
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

155
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:54,424
- Are we there yet?
- No!

156
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,634
Are we there yet?

157
00:09:57,718 --> 00:10:01,764
That's not funny. That's really immature.

158
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:04,099
This is why nobody likes ogres.

159
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,517
Your loss!

160
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,897
- l'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

161
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,566
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!

162
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,489
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

163
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:20,865
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

164
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,576
away!

165
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:26,247
All right, all right, l get it.
l'm just so darn bored.

166
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,916
Well, find a way
to entertain yourself.

167
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,274
For five minutes...

168
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,319
Could you not be yourself...

169
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:07,665
Are we there yet?

170
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:10,415
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

171
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:24,263
Wow!

172
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:29,852
lt's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

173
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:32,857
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

174
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:38,362
# Gotta make a move
to a town that's right for me

175
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,158
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,371
Halt!

177
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:53,502
# Well, I talk about it, talk about it,
talk about it, talk about it

178
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:57,881
Hey, everyone, look.

179
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:01,426
# Talk about, talk about movin'... #

180
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:12,770
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

181
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:23,404
Swimming pools!
Movie stars!

182
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:01,903
Announcing the long-awaited return

183
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:06,575
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

184
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,038
Well, this is it.

185
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,079
- This is it.
- This is it.

186
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:13,415
This is it.

187
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:39,609
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
l'll park the car.

188
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,945
So...

189
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:48,032
you still think
this was a good idea?

190
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:52,538
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

191
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:56,792
- Who on earth are they?
- l think that's our little girl.

192
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,254
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

193
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:03,631
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

194
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:06,926
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

195
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,680
Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

196
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:13,182
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

197
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:16,521
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

198
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:18,104
That was for my own...

199
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:22,027
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

200
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,360
Harold, we have to be...

201
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:26,362
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

202
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,447
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

203
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,867
A disaster! There is no way...

204
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,577
- You can do this.
- l really...

205
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,163
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...

206
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,331
Here!

207
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:42,381
Mom... Dad...

208
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:45,715
l'd like you to meet my husband...

209
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,550
Shrek.

210
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:51,763
Well, um...

211
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:55,183
lt's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

212
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:35,557
Excuse me.

213
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:39,351
Better out than in,
l always say, eh, Fiona?

214
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:43,483
That's good.

215
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:45,275
l guess not.

216
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:49,821
What do you mean, ''not on the list''?
Don't tell me you don't know who l am.

217
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:52,574
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

218
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:57,079
- l had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

219
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,999
No, Dad! lt's all right.
lt's all right. He's with us.

220
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,546
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.

221
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,671
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?

222
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:07,298
Oh, boy.

223
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,468
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

224
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:15,095
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.

225
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:16,180
Mmm!

226
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,224
No, no. Darling.

227
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,143
Oh!

228
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,609
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

229
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,276
Well...

230
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,697
Shrek owns his own land.

231
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:34,116
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

232
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,994
lt's in an enchanted forest

233
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:41,833
abundant in squirrels
and cute little duckies and...

234
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,251
What?

235
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,501
l know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

236
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:49,717
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

237
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,718
l suppose that would be a fine place
to raise the children.

238
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:06,022
lt's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

239
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:09,026
- lndeed. l just started eating.
- Harold!

240
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,278
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. lt's great, OK?

241
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,159
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

242
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,576
l got to go to the bathroom.

243
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,122
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. l can hold it.

244
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,044
Bon appetit!

245
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:29,588
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.

246
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:33,300
Let's not sit here with our tummies
rumbling. Everybody dig in.

247
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,760
Don't mind if l do, Lillian.

248
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:38,638
l suppose any grandchildren
l could expect from you would be...

249
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:41,059
Ogres, yes!

250
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:44,104
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

251
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,940
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

252
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,233
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

253
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:50,109
Dad!

254
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:54,823
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

255
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:58,617
- Shrek, please!
- l only did that because l love her.

256
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,996
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

257
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,248
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

258
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,715
lt's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

259
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,427
- Harold!
- Shrek!

260
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:18,512
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

261
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,848
- Mom!
- Harold...

262
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:20,931
Donkey!

263
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:27,165
# Your fallen tears have called to me

264
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:32,044
# So, here comes my sweet remedy

265
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:37,466
# I know what every princess needs

266
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:42,345
# For her to live life happily... #

267
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:48,480
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.

268
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,398
You're all grown up.

269
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:55,109
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

270
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,196
l'm your fairy godmother.

271
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,906
- l have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

272
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:04,369
Now, don't worry.
l'm here to make it all better.

273
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,498
With just a...

274
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,793
# Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone

275
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:16,756
# With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash

276
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,801
# A high-priced dress
made by mice no less

277
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,011
# Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress

278
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:23,054
# Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse

279
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,847
# Confide in your very own
furniture friends

280
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:28,059
# We'll help you set a new fashion trend

281
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:32,146
- # I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
- # The kind of girl a prince would date!

282
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,524
# They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...

283
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:36,691
# ''For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!''

284
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,739
# A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle

285
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,410
# Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away

286
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,204
# And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!'

287
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,082
# Nip and tuck, here and there
to land that prince with the perfect hair

288
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,585
# Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush

289
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,672
# Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay

290
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,966
# You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune

291
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,679
# Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs

292
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:06,431
# Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!

293
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,060
# Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair #

294
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,227
Stop!

295
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,064
Look...

296
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,856
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

297
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:18,818
but l really don't need all this.

298
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,740
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

299
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:26,910
Fiona? Fiona?

300
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,085
Oh! You got a puppy?
All l got in my room was shampoo.

301
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,795
Oh, uh...

302
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,920
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

303
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,382
l'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

304
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:45,093
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

305
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,847
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

306
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:50,852
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

307
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,727
She's just trying to help.

308
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,023
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

309
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,607
- What?
- l don't want to leave.

310
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,235
When did you decide this?

311
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,987
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, l'm sorry...

312
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,449
No, that's all right.
l need to go, anyway.

313
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,827
But remember, dear.
lf you should ever need me...

314
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,079
happiness...

315
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,872
is just a teardrop away.

316
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,499
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

317
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:16,459
Happy, happy, happy...

318
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,711
So l see.

319
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:20,631
Let's go, Kyle.

320
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,927
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

321
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,721
l told you coming here was a bad idea.

322
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,474
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

323
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,143
l don't think l was going to get
Daddy's blessing,

324
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,978
even if l did want it.

325
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:39,106
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what l wanted?

326
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:41,568
Sure. Do you want me
to pack for you?

327
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:46,531
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

328
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,618
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

329
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,163
Here's a news flash for you!

330
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:55,166
Whether your parents like it or not...
l am an ogre!

331
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:04,757
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

332
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,684
l've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

333
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,565
That's real smooth, Shrek.
''l'm an ogre!''

334
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,927
l knew this would happen.

335
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,929
You should.
You started it.

336
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,016
l can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

337
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,561
l think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

338
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,980
This is Fiona's choice.

339
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,150
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

340
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:07,446
l mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

341
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,449
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

342
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:16,162
l don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

343
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,832
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

344
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,751
Don't you remember when
we were young?

345
00:24:21,876 --> 00:24:24,796
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

346
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:28,091
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

347
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,594
lt's not the same!

348
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:33,681
l don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

349
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,099
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

350
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,060
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

351
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,146
La, di, da, di, da!
lsn't it all wonderful!

352
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,275
l'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

353
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,609
Hello, Harold.

354
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,734
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

355
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,781
Just the old crusade wound
playing up a bit!

356
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,618
l'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

357
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,788
You better get in.
We need to talk.

358
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,956
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
off to bed.

359
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,710
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

360
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:06,630
So, how about... we make this
a quick visit. What?

361
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,634
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!

362
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:13,887
So, what's new?

363
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:17,683
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

364
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:21,228
ls that you? My gosh!
lt's been years.

365
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,482
When did you get back?

366
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,525
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

367
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,155
After l endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

368
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,240
l climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

369
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,702
Mommy can handle this.

370
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:39,913
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

371
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,959
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower...

372
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,169
And what does he find?

373
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,966
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

374
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,926
is already married.

375
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,469
lt wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

376
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,221
Stop the car!

377
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,389
Harold.

378
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:04,146
You force me to do something
l really don't want to do.

379
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,191
Where are we?

380
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,235
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May l take your order?

381
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:13,447
My diet is ruined!
l hope you're happy. Er... okay.

382
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,369
Two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo... chili rings...

383
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,913
- l'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

384
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

385
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,834
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, l'm fine.

386
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,795
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.

387
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,048
There you are, dear.

388
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,263
We made a deal, Harold, and l assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

389
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,556
lndeed not.

390
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,269
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

391
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,857
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. lt's what's best.

392
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,441
Not only for your daughter...

393
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,736
but for your Kingdom.

394
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,492
What am l supposed to do about it?

395
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:03,039
Use your imagination.

396
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,699
Oh...

397
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:43,496
Come on in, Your Majesty.

398
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,629
# I like my town

399
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:58,096
# With a little drop of poison

400
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,640
# Nobody knows...

401
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,975
Excuse me.

402
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,312
Do l know you?

403
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:10,190
No, you must be mistaking me
for someone else.

404
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:13,985
Uh... excuse me.
l'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

405
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,491
Ah! There you are. Right.

406
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:23,870
You see, l need to have
someone taken care of.

407
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:28,291
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

408
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,209
Um... He's an ogre.

409
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,756
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

410
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:39,177
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

411
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,386
he don't like to be disturbed.

412
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,140
Where could l find him?

413
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,604
Hello?

414
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,647
Who dares enter my room?

415
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,359
Sorry! l hope l'm not interrupting, but
l'm told you're the one to talk to

416
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,152
about an ogre problem?

417
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,531
You are told correct.

418
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:03,367
But for this, l charge
a great deal of money.

419
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,578
Would... this be enough?

420
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:17,590
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

421
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:21,010
Just tell me where
l can find this ogre.

422
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:45,618
# Everyone says
I'm getting down too low

423
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:52,542
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go

424
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,337
# You just gotta let it go

425
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:08,182
# I need some sleep

426
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:11,645
# Time to put the old horse down

427
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,523
# I'm in too deep

428
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,900
# And the wheels keep spinning round

429
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:26,285
# Everyone says
you've just gotta let it go #

430
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:33,875
Dear Knight, I pray that you take
this favor as a token of my gratitude.

431
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,484
Dear Diary...

432
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,277
Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,

433
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,156
but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.

434
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,826
Dad says I'm going away for a while.

435
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:10,245
Must be like some finishing school.

436
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,122
Mom says that when I'm old enough,

437
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,918
my Prince Charming will rescue me
from my tower

438
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,545
and bring me back to my family,

439
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,840
and we'll all live
happily ever after.

440
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,678
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

441
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,557
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

442
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,935
Mrs. Fiona Charming.

443
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:45,488
Sorry. l hope l'm not
interrupting anything.

444
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:51,162
No, no. l was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

445
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:56,292
l was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

446
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,835
- Okay...
- l don't know what came over me.

447
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:02,339
Do you suppose we could pretend
it never happened and start over...

448
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:05,508
- Look, Your Majesty, l just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

449
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,721
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

450
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:13,309
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

451
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:17,854
Excellent idea! l was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

452
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,940
A little father-son time?

453
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,277
l know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

454
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:37,167
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?

455
00:32:42,672 --> 00:32:44,714
Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.

456
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,552
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

457
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,054
''Head to the
darkest part of the woods...''

458
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:54,142
''Past the sinister trees
with scary-looking branches.''

459
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:58,521
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

460
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,482
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

461
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:05,987
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

462
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,072
and l end up lost
in the woods with you!

463
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,407
Don't get huffy!
l'm only trying to help.

464
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,450
l know! l know.

465
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,165
- l'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

466
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:21,419
l just really need to make
things work with this guy.

467
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:24,338
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

468
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:33,723
Well, well, well, Donkey.

469
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:37,309
l know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

470
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:39,144
What? l ain't purring.

471
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,562
Sure. What's next? A hug?

472
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:45,778
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think l am, some kind of a...

473
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,445
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!

474
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:50,949
Look! A little cat.

475
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:54,160
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- lt's a cat, Donkey.

476
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,246
Come here,
little kitty, kitty.

477
00:33:56,329 --> 00:34:01,417
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

478
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,336
Whoa!

479
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,673
- Hold on, Shrek! l'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

480
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:11,009
Oh, God. Oh...

481
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,720
No!

482
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:17,183
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

483
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,228
Shrek! Hold still!

484
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:24,358
- Did l miss?
- No. You got them.

485
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:31,613
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

486
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:36,203
Puss... in Boots!

487
00:34:36,244 --> 00:34:37,828
l'll kill that cat!

488
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:39,079
Ah-ha-ha!

489
00:34:57,098 --> 00:35:00,810
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

490
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:03,771
What should we do with him?

491
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:07,192
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

492
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:08,569
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!

493
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:11,403
l implore you!
lt was nothing personal, Señor.

494
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,197
l was doing it only for my family.

495
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,286
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!

496
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:20,872
The King offered me much in gold
and l have a litter of brothers...

497
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:22,415
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

498
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:25,250
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

499
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,255
The rich King? SÍ.

500
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:34,178
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

501
00:35:34,261 --> 00:35:37,598
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

502
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,057
Gee, thanks.

503
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:46,647
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if l were some sort of Prince Charming.

504
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,109
That's what the King said.

505
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,861
Oh, uh... sorry. l thought that question
was directed at me.

506
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:56,908
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

507
00:35:56,992 --> 00:36:00,204
Well, it's not like
l wouldn't change if l could.

508
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:04,332
l just... l just wish
l could make her happy.

509
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:08,002
Hold the phone...

510
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:11,714
''Happiness.''

511
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:14,675
''A tear drop away.''

512
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:18,597
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

513
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,307
Aw, man, where do l begin?

514
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:25,687
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

515
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,525
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

516
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:33,695
Then they got drunk and start beating me
with a stick, going ''Piñata!!''

517
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:35,112
What is a piñata, anyway?

518
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,616
No, Donkey! l need you to cry!

519
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,117
Don't go projecting on me.

520
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:41,327
l know you're feeling bad,
but you got to...

521
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,495
Aaaahhh!

522
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,790
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

523
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:56,009
What? Is it on? Is it on?

524
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:59,138
This is Fairy Godmother.

525
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,431
I'm either away
from my desk or with a client.

526
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:06,019
But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you an appointment.

527
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:07,937
Have a ''happy ever after. ''

528
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:11,357
Oh...

529
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,569
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

530
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:18,156
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

531
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,743
# Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!

532
00:37:21,826 --> 00:37:26,457
- Stop, Ogre! l have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

533
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,377
On my honor, l am obliged to accompany
you until l have saved your life

534
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,379
as you have spared me mine.

535
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,715
The position of annoying talking animal
has already been taken.

536
00:37:35,798 --> 00:37:38,720
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

537
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,897
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

538
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:52,899
in his wee little boots.

539
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:56,235
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

540
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:59,073
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

541
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,117
Ahh!

542
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,994
Listen. He's purring!

543
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:07,165
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

544
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:10,751
Lighten up? l should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

545
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:15,588
Shrek!

546
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:21,345
Shrek?

547
00:38:32,314 --> 00:38:34,775
They're both festive, aren't they?

548
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,776
What do you think, Harold?

549
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:39,112
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.

550
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:44,786
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

551
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:47,287
Honestly, Lillian,
l don't think it matters.

552
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:49,666
How do we know there will
even be a ball?

553
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:51,667
Mom. Dad.

554
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:55,379
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

555
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:58,132
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

556
00:38:58,174 --> 00:39:01,009
l haven't.
You should ask your father.

557
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:05,723
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

558
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:08,225
- Can l help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

559
00:39:09,225 --> 00:39:11,854
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

560
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:15,064
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

561
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:18,903
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

562
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:23,074
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, l haven't, dear.

563
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:26,993
l'm sure he just went off to look for
a nice... mud hole to cool down in.

564
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:29,329
You know, after your
little spat last night.

565
00:39:29,413 --> 00:39:31,707
Oh. You heard that, huh?

566
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,500
The whole kingdom heard you.

567
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:36,378
l mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be...

568
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,963
well, a bit of a brute.

569
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:42,217
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

570
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,719
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

571
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:49,475
Shrek loves me for who l am.

572
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,186
l would think you'd be happy for me.

573
00:39:52,228 --> 00:39:55,688
Darling, l'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

574
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,025
Maybe you should do the same.

575
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:14,208
No, really?

576
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,170
Shh...

577
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,633
Oh...

578
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,474
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

579
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,474
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

580
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:35,019
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

581
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:38,732
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

582
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,656
He makes me laugh.

583
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,372
Hi. l'm here to see the...

584
00:40:53,455 --> 00:40:56,458
The Fairy Godmother.
l'm sorry. She is not in.

585
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,502
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

586
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,093
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

587
00:41:04,134 --> 00:41:06,927
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

588
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:09,180
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

589
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:10,222
The union?

590
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:14,728
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

591
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:16,520
Oh! Oh, right.

592
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:19,690
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

593
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:23,444
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.

594
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,196
They don't even have dental.

595
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,613
Okay, we'll just have
a look around.

596
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,866
Oh. By the way.

597
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:32,286
l think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

598
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:35,415
- Know what l'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

599
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,793
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

600
00:42:08,197 --> 00:42:09,907
A drop of desire.

601
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:12,826
Naughty!

602
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:15,664
A pinch of passion.

603
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:23,254
And just a hint of...

604
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:25,048
lust!

605
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:30,552
Excuse me.

606
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:32,346
Sorry to barge in like this...

607
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:35,557
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

608
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:40,603
Well, it seems
that Fiona's not exactly happy.

609
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,023
Oh-ho-ho!

610
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:44,692
And there's some question
as to why that is?

611
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:47,737
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

612
00:42:49,404 --> 00:42:53,326
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.

613
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:56,621
Here we are.
''Lived happily ever after.'' Oh...

614
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:58,872
No ogres!

615
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:00,376
Let's see. Snow White.

616
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:04,211
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

617
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:06,547
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

618
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:09,757
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

619
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,804
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

620
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:15,557
No, no, no, no, no!

621
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:20,018
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

622
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:21,729
All right, look, lady!

623
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,484
Don't you point...
those dirty green sausages at me!

624
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:28,694
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

625
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:30,278
Oh! Sorry.

626
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:32,406
Ah... that's okay.

627
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:34,783
We were just leaving.

628
00:43:34,866 --> 00:43:37,539
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

629
00:43:37,622 --> 00:43:39,414
Just... go.

630
00:43:39,456 --> 00:43:40,791
Come on, guys.

631
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,598
TGlF, eh, buddy?

632
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:03,271
Working hard or hardly working,
eh, Mac?

633
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:16,075
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

634
00:44:16,158 --> 00:44:18,120
Man, that stinks!

635
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:21,413
You don't exactly smell like
a basket of roses.

636
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:28,922
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- l was just concocting this very plan!

637
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:32,093
Already our minds are becoming one.

638
00:44:32,176 --> 00:44:37,055
Whoa, whoa. lf we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

639
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:38,765
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

640
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:42,061
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

641
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:45,479
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

642
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:47,607
No problema, boss.
ln one of my nine lives,

643
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,568
l was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

644
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:51,943
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

645
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:53,405
Shrek, are you off your nut?

646
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:55,074
Donkey, keep watch.

647
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:57,117
Keep watch?
Yeah, l'll keep watch.

648
00:44:57,201 --> 00:45:01,287
l'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

649
00:45:01,371 --> 00:45:04,290
l'll laugh, too.
l'll be giggling to myself.

650
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:07,126
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

651
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:11,255
l'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution
for marital problems.

652
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,258
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.

653
00:45:13,341 --> 00:45:16,802
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try ''handsome.''

654
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:19,223
Sorry. No handsome.

655
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:23,560
Hey! How about ''Happily Ever After''?

656
00:45:23,644 --> 00:45:25,771
Well, what does it do?

657
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:29,190
lt says ''Beauty Divine.''

658
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:32,652
ln some cultures, donkeys are revered
as the wisest of creatures.

659
00:45:32,735 --> 00:45:34,279
Especially us talking ones.

660
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:36,490
Donkey!

661
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:40,035
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

662
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:48,794
Can we get on with this?

663
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:53,716
Hurry!

664
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:03,768
Nice catch, Donkey!

665
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:05,852
Finally! A good use for your mouth.

666
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:11,316
Come on!

667
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:19,908
# You spurn my natural emotions

668
00:46:19,992 --> 00:46:23,786
# You make me feel like dirt
and I'm hurt

669
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,669
# And if I start a commotion

670
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:34,382
# I run the risk of losing you
and that's worse

671
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,764
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

672
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:44,348
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

673
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:47,728
# In love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

674
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:57,737
# Ever fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love

675
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,575
# In love with someone,
ever fallen in love

676
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:03,160
# With someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with

677
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,455
# Fallen in love with

678
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:12,295
# Ever fallen in love with someone
you shouldn't have fallen in love with #

679
00:47:13,045 --> 00:47:17,756
l don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

680
00:47:17,841 --> 00:47:22,680
And somebody bring me something
deep fried and smothered in chocolate!

681
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,143
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

682
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:30,688
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

683
00:47:30,771 --> 00:47:32,898
Whoa, what happened here?

684
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:36,068
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

685
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:38,653
l shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

686
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:41,156
l will smite him where he stands!

687
00:47:41,198 --> 00:47:45,243
He will rue the very day he stole
my kingdom from me!

688
00:47:45,995 --> 00:47:49,832
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

689
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:52,503
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

690
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,629
Pardon. Um...

691
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:58,966
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

692
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:00,092
What?

693
00:48:01,135 --> 00:48:02,136
Oh...

694
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:06,223
l do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

695
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:11,728
''Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.

696
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:14,439
''For you and your true love.

697
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:17,193
''lf one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine.

698
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,112
''Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine.''

699
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:23,908
- You both will be fine?
- l guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

700
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:28,620
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

701
00:48:28,703 --> 00:48:31,665
Drop that jug o' voodoo
and let's get out of here.

702
00:48:31,748 --> 00:48:35,169
lt says, ''Beauty Divine.''
How bad can it be?

703
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:40,174
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

704
00:48:40,341 --> 00:48:44,679
And if you think that l'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

705
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:47,806
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion...

706
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,809
allow me to take the first sip.

707
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:53,354
lt would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

708
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:55,565
Oh, no, no. l don't think so.

709
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:58,233
lf there'll be any animal testing,
l'll do it.

710
00:48:58,317 --> 00:49:01,403
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

711
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,493
How do you feel?

712
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,791
l don't feel any different.
l look any different?

713
00:49:12,832 --> 00:49:14,999
You still look like an ass to me.

714
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:18,129
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

715
00:49:19,046 --> 00:49:22,967
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

716
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,762
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- l know.

717
00:49:26,804 --> 00:49:28,723
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- l know.

718
00:49:28,806 --> 00:49:30,473
- No more itchy butt crack?
- l know!

719
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:32,935
- But you love being an ogre!
- l know!

720
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,650
But l love Fiona more.

721
00:49:39,984 --> 00:49:41,861
Shrek, no! Wait!

722
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:59,087
Got to be... l think you grabbed
the ''Farty Ever After'' potion.

723
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:00,962
Maybe it's a dud.

724
00:50:01,005 --> 00:50:04,051
Or maybe Fiona and l
were never meant to be.

725
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:11,306
Uh-oh. What did l tell you?
l feel something coming on.

726
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:14,686
l don't want to die.
l don't want to die. l don't want to die!

727
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:18,105
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
l'm melting!

728
00:50:18,189 --> 00:50:20,274
l'm melting!

729
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:22,276
lt's just the rain, Donkey.

730
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:25,698
Oh.

731
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:10,200
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

732
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:12,868
and Fiona's father hired
a sleazy hitman to whack you.

733
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:17,000
lt'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

734
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:20,210
# The sun'll come out...

735
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:22,086
# Tomorrow

736
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:24,880
# Bet your bottom... #

737
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:26,800
Bet my bottom?

738
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:28,217
l'm coming, Elizabeth!

739
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:29,969
Donkey?

740
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:31,929
Are you all right?

741
00:51:32,014 --> 00:51:35,892
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?

742
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,696
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.

743
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,531
What is it, darling?

744
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,241
Dad...

745
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:54,661
l've been thinking
about what you said.

746
00:51:55,618 --> 00:51:57,540
And l'm going to set things right.

747
00:51:57,664 --> 00:52:00,166
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.

748
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:02,961
lt was a mistake to bring Shrek here.

749
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:05,795
l'm going to go out and find him.

750
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:08,967
And then we'll go back
to the swamp where we belong.

751
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:13,970
Fiona, please!

752
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:17,059
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.

753
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,144
Fiona!

754
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:05,941
Look, l told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.

755
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,861
Good morning, sleepyhead.

756
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:12,530
Good morning!

757
00:53:12,613 --> 00:53:14,158
We love your kitty!

758
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,994
- Oh... My head...
- Here, l fetched a pail of water.

759
00:53:18,036 --> 00:53:19,621
Thanks.

760
00:53:19,705 --> 00:53:20,705
Uhh!

761
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:24,793
Aahh!

762
00:53:24,877 --> 00:53:25,836
Oh...

763
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,339
A cute button nose?

764
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:32,425
Thick, wavy locks?

765
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,345
Taut, round buttocks?

766
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,721
l'm... l'm...

767
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:39,140

- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

770
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,523
- You're tense.
- l want to rub his shoulders.

771
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:50,361
- l got it covered.
- l don't have anything to rub.

772
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:52,030
Get in line.

773
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,032
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

774
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,953
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

775
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,079
l can whinny.

776
00:54:01,162 --> 00:54:03,288
l can count.

777
00:54:03,623 --> 00:54:06,543
Look at me, Shrek!
l'm trotting!

778
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,340
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

779
00:54:10,423 --> 00:54:13,590
''Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad.''

780
00:54:13,674 --> 00:54:14,761
Pah!

781
00:54:14,844 --> 00:54:19,347

784
00:54:28,273 --> 00:54:29,448
What?

785

Señor? ''To make the effects

And take it from me, Boss.

You are going to have
one satisfied Princess.

794
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,926
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.

795

old mean, salty...

- Easy.
- ...cantankerous, foul,

angry ogre you always been.

798

annoying donkey.

00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,314
Yeah.

Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

First things first.

Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

807
00:55:33,674 --> 00:55:35,382
l'm blind! Tell the truth.

808
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,176
Will l ever play the violin again?

809

You poor creature!

Well, l guess there is one thing.

Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

813
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:52,984
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

814
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:04,287
Father?
ls everything all right, Father?

815
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:13,463
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, l will repay you.

Hello, handsome.

- Donkey?

843
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:54,729
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

844
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,064
What potion?

845
00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:59,318
Shrek and l took some magic potion.
And well...

846
00:57:59,401 --> 00:58:01,613
Now, we're sexy!

847
00:58:02,904 --> 00:58:03,990
Shrek?

848
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:10,831
For you, baby... l could be.

849
00:58:10,996 --> 00:58:13,248
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

850
00:58:13,373 --> 00:58:15,627
He went inside looking for you.

851
00:58:17,503 --> 00:58:18,504
Shrek?

852
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:22,091
Fiona! Fiona!

853
00:58:24,009 --> 00:58:26,179
You want to dance, pretty boy?

854
00:58:29,014 --> 00:58:32,686
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

855
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,021
Fiona?

856
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:38,691
Shrek?

857
00:58:38,774 --> 00:58:41,610
Aye, Fiona. lt is me.

858
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,362
What happened to your voice?

859
00:58:43,445 --> 00:58:47,576
The potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona.

860
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:50,287
But not the way l feel about you.

861
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:51,828
Fiona?

862
00:58:52,664 --> 00:58:55,583
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

863
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:59,503
Dad. l was so hoping
you'd approve.

864
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:03,175
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

865
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:06,679
l know you never get a second chance
at a first impression,

866
00:59:06,846 --> 00:59:09,263
but, well, what do you think?

867
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:16,186
Fiona! Fiona!

868
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,523
Fiona!

869
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:23,612
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

870
00:59:23,696 --> 00:59:27,200
Oh, shoot! l don't think they
can hear us, pigeon.

871
00:59:29,826 --> 00:59:33,205
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

872
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,166
l just wanted her to be happy.

873
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,543
And now she can be.

874
00:59:38,627 --> 00:59:40,629
Oh, sweetheart.

875
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:44,548
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

876
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:48,678
But look at me.
Look what l've done for her.

877
00:59:48,762 --> 00:59:52,056
lt's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

878
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:56,311
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

879
00:59:56,394 --> 01:00:00,398
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

880
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:09,658
But...

881
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:11,242
l love her.

882
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:14,163
lf you really love her...

883
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:16,289
you'll let her go.

884
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,213
Shrek?

885
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:23,380
Señor.

886
01:00:23,463 --> 01:00:26,466
What's going on?
Where are you going?

887
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:37,103
You wouldn't have had anything to do
with this, would you, Harold?

888
01:00:42,316 --> 01:00:45,403
# People just ain't no good

889
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:51,574
# I think that's well understood

890
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:53,284
There you go, boys.

891
01:00:53,368 --> 01:00:55,329
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

892
01:00:55,413 --> 01:00:57,789
Hey. Why the long face?

893
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:01,417
lt was all just a stupid mistake.

894
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,173
l never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

895
01:01:08,384 --> 01:01:10,302
l hate Mondays.

896
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:14,014
l can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

897
01:01:14,097 --> 01:01:15,683
What choice do l have?

898
01:01:15,766 --> 01:01:19,228
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

899
01:01:19,312 --> 01:01:21,396
Come on. ls he really
that good-looking?

900
01:01:21,479 --> 01:01:23,940
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

901
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:27,235
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

902
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:29,905
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

903
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:33,326
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

904
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:40,123
Look, guys.
lt's for the best.

905
01:01:40,165 --> 01:01:41,584
Mom and Dad approve,

906
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:45,003
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

907
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,963
Everybody wins.

908
01:01:48,006 --> 01:01:49,257
Except for you.

909
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,634
l don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

910
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:54,054
Aye.

911
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:57,641
And that's why
l have to let her go.

912
01:01:58,434 --> 01:02:01,478
Excuse me, is she here?

913
01:02:01,563 --> 01:02:03,730
She's, uh... in the back.

914
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:06,817
Oh, hello again.

915
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:13,156
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

916
01:02:13,238 --> 01:02:17,577
You'd better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

917
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:23,458
Well, l'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

918
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:27,045
- FYl, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

919
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:29,006
l mean,
how charming can l be

920
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:31,466
when l have to pretend
l'm that dreadful ogre?

921
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,594
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

922
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:37,056
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

923
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:41,435
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

924
01:02:41,518 --> 01:02:44,731
l beg to differ.
l do it all the time!

925
01:02:44,772 --> 01:02:49,234
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love
with the first man she kisses,

926
01:02:49,276 --> 01:02:51,238
which will be Charming.

927
01:02:52,361 --> 01:02:55,365
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

928
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:57,827
l can't. l won't do it.

929
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,494
Oh, yes, you will.

930
01:02:59,578 --> 01:03:03,166
lf you remember, l helped you
with your happily ever after.

931
01:03:03,249 --> 01:03:06,794
And l can take it away
just as easily.

932
01:03:06,877 --> 01:03:10,089
ls that what you want? ls it?

933
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,552
- No.
- Good boy.

934
01:03:13,635 --> 01:03:15,387
Now, we have to go.

935
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,721
l need to do Charming's hair
before the ball.

936
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:20,057
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.

937
01:03:20,098 --> 01:03:22,934
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.

938
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:24,686
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

939
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,605
Mother?

940
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:29,816
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

941
01:03:29,899 --> 01:03:30,900
The ogre!

942
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:36,782
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

943
01:03:38,451 --> 01:03:41,412
The abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the maximus

944
01:03:41,495 --> 01:03:44,874
here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!

945
01:03:44,957 --> 01:03:48,042
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

946
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:49,878
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

947
01:03:49,962 --> 01:03:51,921
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

948
01:03:51,963 --> 01:03:54,508
to honor Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

949
01:03:54,592 --> 01:03:57,594
And, oh my,
the outfits look gorgeous!

950
01:03:57,677 --> 01:03:59,055
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

951
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:01,766
What the heck are the crumbs for?

952
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:04,894
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

953
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:07,647
Oh, aren't they adorable!

954
01:04:07,689 --> 01:04:10,815
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

955
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,819
Tired old thing.

956
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,488
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

957
01:04:16,529 --> 01:04:19,701
Oh. lt's the one, it's the only...

958
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:22,369
lt's the Fairy Godmother!

959
01:04:22,453 --> 01:04:25,663
Hello, Far, Far Away!

960
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:29,001
Can l get a whoop whoop?

961
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:33,756
May all your endings be happy and...

962
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,926
Well, you know the rest!

963
01:04:37,009 --> 01:04:39,971
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball

964
01:04:40,054 --> 01:04:41,972
after these messages.

965
01:04:42,014 --> 01:04:43,641
l hate these ball shows.

966
01:04:43,808 --> 01:04:46,894
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!

967
01:04:46,977 --> 01:04:50,606
l'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until l see Shrek and Fiona.

968
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:53,359
Whizzes on you guys.

969
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:55,529
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!

970
01:04:55,612 --> 01:04:57,864
No, to your left. Your left!

971
01:05:00,908 --> 01:05:04,079
- Tonight on ''Knights''...
- Now here's a good show!

972
01:05:04,162 --> 01:05:07,581
We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.

973
01:05:07,664 --> 01:05:09,749
It's time to teach these madcap mammals

974
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,544
their ''devil may mare'' attitudes
just won't fly.

975
01:05:13,962 --> 01:05:17,717
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

976
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:20,929
l have to talk to Princess Fiona!

977
01:05:21,013 --> 01:05:23,057
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!

978
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,600
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?

979
01:05:25,683 --> 01:05:27,685
You capitalist pig dogs!

980
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,859
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

981
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:38,028
Find Princess Fiona!

982
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:39,781
l'm a donkey!

983
01:05:39,864 --> 01:05:42,532
Tell her Shrek...
l'm her husband, Shrek!

984
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:45,162
Quick! Rewind it!

985
01:05:46,163 --> 01:05:48,665
l'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!

986
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:17,568
Darling?

987
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:20,571
Ah. l thought l might
find you here.

988
01:06:20,614 --> 01:06:24,241
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

989
01:06:25,451 --> 01:06:26,784
l'm not going.

990
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:29,914
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

991
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:33,919
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

992
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:36,795
l mean, look at him.

993
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,592
Yes, he is a bit different,

994
01:06:40,634 --> 01:06:43,719
but people change
for the ones they love.

995
01:06:43,802 --> 01:06:47,013
You'd be surprised how much
l changed for your mother.

996
01:06:47,097 --> 01:06:48,848
Change?

997
01:06:48,932 --> 01:06:51,143
He's completely lost his mind!

998
01:06:51,185 --> 01:06:54,772
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

999
01:06:54,814 --> 01:06:57,733
You might find you like
this new Shrek.

1000
01:06:57,817 --> 01:07:01,072
But it's the old one
l fell in love with, Dad.

1001
01:07:02,112 --> 01:07:04,198
l'd give anything to have him back.

1002
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:10,455
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

1003
01:07:10,622 --> 01:07:12,497
Otherwise l'm up all night.

1004
01:07:19,422 --> 01:07:21,048
Thanks.

1005
01:07:23,509 --> 01:07:25,011
l got to get out of here!

1006
01:07:25,094 --> 01:07:27,764
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

1007
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:29,307
What about my Miranda rights?

1008
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:32,185
You're supposed to say
l have the right to remain silent.

1009
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:34,479
Nobody said l have the right
to remain silent!

1010
01:07:34,521 --> 01:07:37,107
You have the right to remain silent.

1011
01:07:37,233 --> 01:07:39,776
What you lack is the capacity.

1012
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:43,361
l must hold on before l, too,
go totally mad.

1013
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:45,739
Shrek? Donkey?

1014
01:07:46,741 --> 01:07:48,200
Too late.

1015
01:07:48,324 --> 01:07:51,537
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

1016
01:07:51,663 --> 01:07:52,873
Oh...

1017
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,963
Fire in ze hole!

1018
01:08:17,814 --> 01:08:19,106
Look out below!

1019

Quick! Tell a lie!

1020
01:08:23,611 --> 01:08:26,364
- What should l say?
- Anything, but quick!

1021
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:29,493
Say something crazy like
''l'm wearing ladies' underwear!''

1022
01:08:29,576 --> 01:08:31,660
l am wearing ladies' underwear.

1023
01:08:35,498 --> 01:08:38,126
- Are you?
- l most certainly am not!

1024
01:08:39,085 --> 01:08:41,421
lt looks like you
most certainly am are!

1025
01:08:41,462 --> 01:08:43,048
- l am not!
- What kind?

1026
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,718
- lt's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!

1027
01:08:45,842 --> 01:08:47,177
- Are not.
- Are too!

1028
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,972
- Are not!
- Are too!

1029
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:50,763
Here we go. Hang tight.

1030
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:57,228
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!

1031
01:08:57,937 --> 01:08:58,897
Ow!

1032
01:09:01,274 --> 01:09:03,610
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1033
01:09:03,652 --> 01:09:05,820
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

1034
01:09:05,904 --> 01:09:07,824
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

1035
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:09,741
We've got to stop that kiss!

1036
01:09:09,782 --> 01:09:11,659
l thought you was going
to let her go.

1037
01:09:11,743 --> 01:09:14,038
l was, but l can't let them
do this to Fiona.

1038
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:17,332
Boom! That's what l like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

1039
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:19,209
lt's impossible!
We'll never get in.

1040
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:22,254
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!

1041
01:09:22,337 --> 01:09:28,218
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

1042
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:36,310
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1043
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:39,856
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

1044
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:42,398
Because we're gonna need flour.

1045
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:45,526
Lots and lots of flour.

1046
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:50,323
Gingy!

1047
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:54,786
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

1048
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:00,751
lt's alive!

1049
01:10:08,925 --> 01:10:12,763
Run, run, run,
as fast you can!

1050
01:10:19,977 --> 01:10:22,105
Go, baby, go!

1051
01:10:23,608 --> 01:10:26,567
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

1052
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:31,032
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

1053
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:41,541
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

1054
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:45,503
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!

1055
01:10:45,629 --> 01:10:48,090
Pretty pony wants to play
at the castle!

1056
01:10:48,173 --> 01:10:49,841
Pretty pony.

1057
01:10:51,511 --> 01:10:53,429
Ladies and gentlemen.

1058
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:58,267
Presenting Princess Fiona
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1059
01:11:00,727 --> 01:11:02,898
Shrek, what are you doing?

1060
01:11:02,939 --> 01:11:06,192
l'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1061
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:08,151
ls that glitter on your lips?

1062
01:11:08,235 --> 01:11:11,155
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?

1063
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:15,075
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

1064
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:20,247
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

1065
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:22,790
Ladies and gentlemen.

1066
01:11:25,376 --> 01:11:28,298
l'd like to dedicate this song to...

1067
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:31,842
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

1068
01:11:32,842 --> 01:11:34,594
Fiona, my Princess.

1069
01:11:34,677 --> 01:11:37,221
Will you honor me with a dance?

1070
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:42,355
# Where have all the good men gone

1071
01:11:42,438 --> 01:11:45,273
# And where are all the gods?

1072
01:11:45,355 --> 01:11:46,482
Dance!

1073
01:11:46,566 --> 01:11:50,278
# Where's the streetwise Hercules

1074
01:11:50,444 --> 01:11:54,031
# To fight the rising odds?

1075
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:58,659
Since when do you dance?

1076
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:01,622
Fiona, my dearest,
if there's one thing l know,

1077
01:12:01,705 --> 01:12:04,999
it's that love is full of surprises.

1078
01:12:05,082 --> 01:12:07,628
# Late at night I toss and I turn

1079
01:12:07,712 --> 01:12:12,258
# And I dream of what I need

1080
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:16,471
Hit it!

1081
01:12:19,222 --> 01:12:20,891
# I need a hero

1082
01:12:20,974 --> 01:12:25,019
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

1083
01:12:26,438 --> 01:12:28,190
Man the catapults!

1084
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:30,984
Aim! Fire!

1085
01:12:32,112 --> 01:12:35,282
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

1086
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,833
Not the gumdrop button!

1087
01:12:51,254 --> 01:12:53,048
lncoming!

1088
01:12:54,174 --> 01:12:55,760
Ha-ha! All right!

1089
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:04,435
# Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy

1090
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:06,187
Go, Mongo! Go!

1091
01:13:09,814 --> 01:13:12,026
Man the cauldrons!

1092
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:18,866
After you, Mongo.

1093
01:13:21,576 --> 01:13:25,873
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

1094
01:13:28,668 --> 01:13:29,960
Shrek!

1095
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,633
More heat, less foam!

1096
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:38,511
# Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above

1097
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:41,556
# Out where the lightning
Splits the sea

1098
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:46,436
# I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me

1099
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,188
Heave! Ho!

1100
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:57,863
No...!

1101
01:14:27,269 --> 01:14:28,853
Come on!

1102
01:14:30,104 --> 01:14:31,230
Look out!

1103
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:35,025
Be good.

1104
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,863
He needs me!
Let me go!

1105
01:14:42,285 --> 01:14:43,911
Donkey!

1106
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:54,629
Puss!

1107
01:14:57,632 --> 01:15:00,135
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

1108
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,390
Today, l repay my debt.

1109
01:15:10,854 --> 01:15:12,982
Aww...

1110
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:15,943
On guard!

1111
01:15:19,237 --> 01:15:22,281
# He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast

1112
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:25,911
# And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight

1113
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:28,870
- # I need a hero #
- Stop!

1114
01:15:33,336 --> 01:15:37,964
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

1115
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,427
You couldn't just go back to your swamp
and leave well enough alone.

1116
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,763
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

1117
01:15:48,516 --> 01:15:50,059
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

1118
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:51,895
l see London! l see France!

1119
01:15:51,978 --> 01:15:53,312
Whah!

1120
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:57,026
l'm a real boy!

1121
01:16:03,156 --> 01:16:05,074
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!

1122
01:16:06,868 --> 01:16:07,828
Catch!

1123
01:16:09,121 --> 01:16:10,247
Donkey!

1124
01:16:12,915 --> 01:16:13,915
Oh!

1125
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:16,002
l'm a real boy. Aah!

1126
01:16:16,044 --> 01:16:17,545
Oh!

1127
01:16:19,381 --> 01:16:20,798
- Ha!
- Ah.

1128
01:16:20,883 --> 01:16:22,635
That's mine!

1129
01:16:26,763 --> 01:16:28,350
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

1130
01:16:28,473 --> 01:16:30,058
And Donkey!

1131
01:16:30,141 --> 01:16:33,103
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

1132
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:37,441
No!

1133
01:16:55,084 --> 01:16:57,127
Hi-ya!

1134
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:01,589
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

1135
01:17:01,673 --> 01:17:05,677
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

1136
01:17:05,761 --> 01:17:09,596
Well, l guess l gave her
the wrong tea.

1137
01:17:09,763 --> 01:17:12,101
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1138
01:17:12,726 --> 01:17:15,480
l told you.

1139
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:19,774
Ogres don't live happily ever after.

1140
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:30,409
Woo!

1141
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:32,244
Ha!

1142
01:17:43,297 --> 01:17:45,300
Oh, Dad!

1143
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:51,139
- ls he...?
- Yup.

1144
01:17:52,515 --> 01:17:54,309
He croaked.

1145
01:17:56,478 --> 01:17:57,729
Harold?

1146
01:17:57,813 --> 01:17:58,771
Dad?

1147
01:17:59,731 --> 01:18:02,150
l'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

1148
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:04,487
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

1149
01:18:04,528 --> 01:18:06,782
No, no, he's right.
l'm sorry.

1150
01:18:07,698 --> 01:18:08,782
To both of you.

1151
01:18:08,866 --> 01:18:11,827
l only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

1152
01:18:12,828 --> 01:18:15,080
But l can see now...

1153
01:18:15,164 --> 01:18:16,833
she already has it.

1154
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:19,961
Shrek, Fiona...

1155
01:18:20,044 --> 01:18:24,964
Will you accept
an old frog's apologies...

1156
01:18:25,006 --> 01:18:27,842
and my blessing?

1157
01:18:27,884 --> 01:18:30,180
Harold?
l'm sorry, Lillian.

1158
01:18:30,264 --> 01:18:33,808
l just wish l could be
the man you deserve.

1159
01:18:35,058 --> 01:18:38,228
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

1160
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:40,272
warts and all.

1161
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:46,570
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!

1162
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:47,779
Midnight!

1163
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:51,490
Fiona. ls this what you want?

1164
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:54,536
To be this way forever?

1165
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:58,332
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

1166
01:18:58,374 --> 01:19:00,083
we can stay like this.

1167
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:03,129
You'd do that?

1168
01:19:03,213 --> 01:19:05,171
- For me?
- Yes.

1169
01:19:13,972 --> 01:19:16,808
l want what any princess wants.

1170
01:19:16,892 --> 01:19:19,562
To live happily ever after...

1171
01:19:23,691 --> 01:19:26,361
with the ogre l married.

1172
01:19:29,404 --> 01:19:32,407
Whatever happens,
l must not cry!

1173
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,576
You cannot make me cry!

1174
01:19:56,723 --> 01:19:58,100
Whoa!

1175
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:03,021
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.

1176
01:20:06,274 --> 01:20:07,985
Oh, no.

1177
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,881
Hey. You still look like
a noble steed to me.

1178
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,720
Now, where were we?

1179
01:20:35,804 --> 01:20:38,141
Oh. l remember.

1180
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:49,276
Hey! lsn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

1181
01:20:49,318 --> 01:20:50,944
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!

1182
01:20:58,203 --> 01:20:59,702
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

1183
01:20:59,786 --> 01:21:02,540
# She's into superstitions

1184
01:21:02,623 --> 01:21:05,250
# Black cats and voodoo dolls

1185
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:08,004
- Sing it, Puss!
- # I feel a premonition

1186
01:21:08,045 --> 01:21:10,507
# That girl's gonna make me fall

1187
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:13,134
Here we go!

1188
01:21:13,176 --> 01:21:16,012
# She's into new sensations

1189
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:18,514
# New kicks in the candlelight

1190
01:21:18,556 --> 01:21:21,225
# She's got a new addiction

1191
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,769
# For every day and night

1192
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:26,063
# She'll make you take your clothes off

1193
01:21:26,146 --> 01:21:29,317
# And go dancing in the rain

1194
