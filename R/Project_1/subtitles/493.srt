1
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,362
Ready? Okay!

2
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:28,040
Two and two, menu.
Brian, 22, immediately.

3
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,211
Guillermo! Guillermo! Two pigeons!
Right away!

4
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,755
Very important table right here.

5
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,806
Give me two-grain.

6
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,183
I'll take that polenta.

7
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,395
- This is the one I'm waiting for.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,232
I need that special meat now. Pastry,
get ready. It's coming at you.

9
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,225
I'll kill your family
if this isn't perfect.

10
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,177
Yes, sir.

11
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,882
I'm writing it up as...

12
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,383
...inventive...

13
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,094
...and confident.

14
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,436
Oh, by the way, did the chap
from Newsday ever call?

15
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,563
I'll check my machine.

16
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,148
Is this a real interview...

17
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,901
...or just some cute guy
you're setting me up with?

18
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,279
I don't send many anymore. You
don't know what to do with them.

19
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,533
Hey, it's Michael. Jules,
it must be months, huh?

20
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,869
So I can't wait to talk to you.

21
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,456
I'm in Chicago at
the Drake Hotel.

22
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,502
Okay, well, call me, 4 in the morning,
whenever. We gotta talk. Bye.

23
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,963
Who called? Man of the moment?

24
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,631
No, the opposite.

25
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,635
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
Sounds desperate to talk to me.

26
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,013
Oh, the wandering sports writer.
Remind me about that one.

27
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,723
Sophomore year at Brown...

28
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,393
- ...we had this one hot month.
- One hot month.

29
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,603
Yes. But of course, you know me.

30
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,272
I got restless.

31
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,818
So I get up the nerve
to break his heart...

32
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,153
...and he gives me this look...

33
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,657
...and says, "I wanna
cry because..."

34
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,368
...I'm losing the best
friend I ever had."

35
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,163
And at that moment I knew
I felt the same way.

36
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,751
So I cried for maybe the third
time in my entire life...

37
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,378
...kissed him...

38
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,506
...and we've been best
friends ever since.

39
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,051
We've seen each other
through everything:

40
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,638
Losing jobs...

41
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,141
...losing parents,
losing lovers.

42
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,393
We've travelled all over.

43
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,521
Best times of my life, maybe.

44
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,274
Drinking and talking.

45
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,194
- Even if it's just over the phone.
- Go on. This is so moving.

46
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,947
- Kindred spirits?
- No, he's nothing like me.

47
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,034
He's like you, actually,
only straight.

48
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:12,079
I remember this one night
in Tucson, six years ago.

49
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,041
He takes a razor out of
this tiny little kit...

50
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,086
...cuts his finger, takes my
hand, does the same to me.

51
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,882
He says, "Swear when we're 28,
if we've never married..."

52
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,425
...we marry each other."

53
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:30,139
We never talked about it again. I don't
know what made me think of that.

54
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,684
You're about to be 28
in three weeks, right?

55
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,021
How old's he?

56
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,523
You think?

57
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,401
Desperate to talk.

58
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,203
- No.
- Cheers.

59
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,336
Hey, it's Michael. Jules,
it must be months, huh?

60
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,340
I can't wait to talk to you. I'm
in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.

61
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,511
Okay, well, call me, 4 in the morning,
whenever. We gotta talk. Bye.

62
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,975
Good evening, the Drake Hotel.

63
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,604
Yes. I'm calling for Mike O'Neal.
It's late, so I'd like to leave...

64
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,397
One moment, please.

65
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,943
Hello?

66
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,198
Hello, you've been enrolled in the
Obscene Caller of the Month Club.

67
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,284
Hey, beautiful, it's so
great to hear your voice.

68
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,454
I miss you. I've been calling
you for over a month.

69
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,206
I've been on a book tour.

70
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,459
- I figured you're out of town.
- My machine eats my messages.

71
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,045
Or you're averaging 30
days to return a call.

72
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,380
It's less when it's you.

73
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,591
I have to ask you something
incredibly important...

74
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,885
...and if you turn me
down, I don't know...

75
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,139
If I could just tell
you one thing first.

76
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:02,106
This is probably going to hand you the
biggest laugh of your adult life.

77
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,318
But I was thinking about you
and I remembered this...

78
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,738
...unbelievably insane night
we spent in Tucson...

79
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,410
...I don't know, a thousand years ago,
and you probably won't remember...

80
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,746
Are you kidding? I think about
that night all the time.

81
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,415
You do?

82
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,917
But it's not why I called.

83
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,670
It's not.

84
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,298
I called because I met someone.

85
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,054
That's great, that's great,
because you haven't really...

86
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,183
...seen anybody, have you,
since dingbat Jenny Lee?

87
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,729
No, you don't understand. I've
never felt this way about anybody.

88
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,023
And she's all wrong for me.

89
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,608
There's a good start.

90
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,236
Kim's a junior at the University
of Chicago. She's 20.

91
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,781
You'll love her. She's beautiful.
Her dad's a billionaire.

92
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,034
Owns the White Sox
and a cable empire.

93
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,079
You know I've always been
uncomfortable around rich people.

94
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,123
But they're not like that.

95
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,877
They're such wonderful people, really.
Salt of the earth.

96
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,005
So you've met her parents?

97
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,465
Yeah.

98
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,093
Jules, we're getting
married this Sunday.

99
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,430
Hello?

100
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,849
- Michael. Michael...
- Hello?

101
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,100
Michael.

102
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:24,063
It's Wednesday night. How can you
possibly get married on Sunday?

103
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,399
It all starts tomorrow. It's one
of these four-day weddings...

104
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,485
...with all the
traditional events...

105
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,072
...and 10 million people flying
in from all over the world.

106
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,243
But aren't you working this weekend?
I mean, is that responsible?

107
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:42,915
Sox are at home. Sports is letting
me do a profile on Frank Thomas...

108
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,836
Wait, what do you mean, irresponsible?
Taking off a weekend to get married?

109
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,799
Jules, I'm scared.

110
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,595
- Maybe we should talk about this.
- I need you.

111
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,808
You can't come and hold my hand,
I'll never get through this.

112
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,643
Please come.

113
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,145
- Please.
- Well...

114
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,274
Oh, man, I can't wait
for you to meet her.

115
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,154
Let's have a drink.
Take a later flight.

116
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,614
No, I'm a busy girl.

117
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:20,077
I have exactly four days to break up a
wedding, steal the bride's fella...

118
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,288
...and I haven't one
clue how to do it.

119
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,874
- He adored me for nine goddamn years.
- I can see why.

120
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,669
She has known him for
what, like, five seconds?

121
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,339
She's got billions of dollars,
plus she's apparently perfect.

122
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:36,427
So don't go feeling all sorry
for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois.

123
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,806
I can't lose him, George.

124
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,683
I'm gonna bring him back.

125
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,617
Hey, there you are!

126
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,209
- Over here! Jim!
- Hi!

127
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,904
- Can you believe I'm gonna do this?
- Not hardly.

128
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,214
This just makes
everything so perfect.

129
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:59,843
Since I've met Michael, all I've heard
is Julianne this and Julianne that.

130
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,679
I've never had a sister.

131
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,024
- I have a monstrous favor to ask you.
- Excuse me?

132
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:19,655
My best friend shattered her pelvis
dancing in Abilene over spring break.

133
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,448
Be my maid of honor?

134
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,866
What?

135
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,537
Can you promote a bridesmaid...

136
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,164
...or someone you've known
at least 45 minutes?

137
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,584
My bridesmaids are my only two
female relatives under 40.

138
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:36,672
Debutante sisters from Nashville
who are basically vengeful sluts.

139
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,173
Oh, my exit!

140
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,429
So this means I have four days
to make you my new best friend.

141
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,391
It's time for you to force
yourself to get personal.

142
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,073
- Do you like the color?
- It's beautiful.

143
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,950
- Isn't it perfect?
- Absolutely.

144
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,287
This will be tighter. You don't
want those things to fall out.

145
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,415
- No, it's beautiful.
- I'm not hurting you, okay?

146
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,295
I don't want her to trip, so I'm
going to take this up a tiny bit.

147
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,465
Would you rather the daffodil?

148
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,553
I thought the bridesmaids
all wore the same dress.

149
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,724
Not you. You wouldn't be comfortable
unless you were distinctive.

150
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,312
What else did he tell you?

151
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,273
You hate weddings. You never go.

152
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,735
You're not up for
anything conventional...

153
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,489
...or anything that's assumed
to be a female priority...

154
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,076
...including marriage,
romance or even...

155
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,953
Love?

156
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,958
Michael and I were a wrong
fit right from the start.

157
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,835
He said that too.

158
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,632
Well, I thought I was like you.
And proud to be.

159
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,135
Till I met rumpled,
smelly old Michael.

160
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,972
Then I became a sentimental schmuck
like those flighty nitwits...

161
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,807
...I'd always pitied.

162
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,893
It's funny, huh?

163
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,272
Yeah. I need a cigarette.

164
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,950
George, how do you think I feel?

165
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,619
All she does is talk
about their future...

166
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,205
...and she's just so
bright-eyed and dreamy...

167
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,582
For God's sake, pull
yourself together.

168
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,918
I don't know if I can do it.

169
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,963
- Hi. Hi.
- Want me to turn around or something?

170
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,297
Yes.

171
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,634
Not the person I was expecting.

172
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,807
I've seen you a lot
more naked than that.

173
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,435
Well, things are...

174
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,480
Things are different now.

175
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:03,944
Yeah. I guess so.

176
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,118
You look really good...

177
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,996
...without your clothes on.

178
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,920
Jules!

179
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,631
George...

180
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,134
...she's toast.

181
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,519
So the honeymoon
is where, exactly?

182
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,773
Well, it depends. If San Antonio sweeps
Sacramento, we could start there.

183
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,484
Or Phoenix. Or depending
on the Indiana game...

184
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,944
Garden spots, all.

185
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,031
A swing of 40 degrees represents
a packing challenge...

186
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,826
...but there's fine food and cocktails
at a choice of Embassy Suites.

187
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,287
It's his career. I'm supportive.

188
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,164
Look, I've been everywhere.

189
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,293
I wanna be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.

190
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,629
I'm just saying he's lucky.

191
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,257
It takes a rare woman to put
up with his array of shit.

192
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,510
That guy is a one-man
festival of idiosyncratic...

193
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,180
You've been introduced to
the symphonic range...

194
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,475
Of his snoring? Yeah. He
says it's worse than ever.

195
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,769
- You know that snarfle one?
- Oh, yeah.

196
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,734
Now it's kind of got, like, this
phlegm-rattling thing behind it.

197
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,660
Guess what? Earplugs work.

198
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,788
- What about...?
- Cigars in bed? I broke him of that.

199
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,707
The bathroom's a swamp. He
wears Reeboks to dinner.

200
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,503
He likes action movies. He
reads over my shoulder.

201
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,463
He loves karaoke bars...

202
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,799
- ...and I can't carry a tune.
- Really?

203
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,259
He sucks soup through
his front teeth.

204
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,136
That's a trademark move.

205
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,680
Don't touch that one.

206
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,642
But he sure can kiss.

207
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,773
You know, it's been a while. I'm
just gonna take your word on that.

208
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:13,949
After two weeks of cataloguing
all of his faults...

209
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,619
...I made a command decision
that changed my life.

210
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,167
I threw the list away.

211
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,588
He's not a balance sheet, he's Michael.
Loving him means loving all of him.

212
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,382
You get nervous in small spaces?

213
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,010
It's sweet that you're protective,
but nothing ever could...

214
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,263
...give me pause
about this marriage.

215
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,766
- You get hysterical in small...
- Except one.

216
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,894
You.

217
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:47,107
You'll always be in his mind. This
perfect creature he loved for years.

218
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,025
Perfection can get wearing.

219
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,070
I'm serious. I had to face
my competitive drives...

220
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,489
...and believe me,
I've got them.

221
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,368
Am I gonna be jealous forever?
Our paths will keep crossing.

222
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,912
- Space. Of course.
- He'll always talk about you.

223
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,708
- It's only natural.
- And the answer was so simple.

224
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,918
I was gonna predict that.

225
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,920
You win.

226
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,508
I've missed a step.

227
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,595
He's got you on a pedestal...

228
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,556
...and me in his arms.

229
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,401
My God. It's the bride and the
woman she'll never live up to.

230
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,819
Are you okay, honey?

231
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,154
- Yes.
- So sorry.

232
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,740
She say the wrong thing?
That's so her!

233
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,075
- I'm Julianne.
- We're the vengeful sluts.

234
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,077
You can just call us eager.

235
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,956
Have you sized up the groomsmen?
As M of H, you get first pick.

236
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,376
Don't pick the short, hairy fat one.
He's mine.

237
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,711
Kimmy's a virgin.

238
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,130
- Is this Michael's Julianne?
- Yes.

239
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,466
I'm Isabelle Wallace...

240
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,637
...and my handsome new son
scarcely did you justice, girl.

241
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,888
Now...

242
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,184
...I'm to scoot you to the ballpark
so you can hang with Michael.

243
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,437
But first you have to meet
a lot of really old women.

244
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,690
That is, if you've
absorbed enough profanity.

245
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,069
One! One strike!

246
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,165
Which of you gents
ordered a beer?

247
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,711
- Let me help you.
- You unwittingly imply I'm clumsy.

248
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,964
I confused you with
someone I knew.

249
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,842
Julianne, Hank and Eric
from Sport magazine.

250
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,885
- Hello.
- They kindly gave me a job.

251
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,929
- Hi there.
- How do you do?

252
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,808
And this is Walter,
my father-in-law.

253
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,102
Future father-in-law.

254
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,687
Thank you.

255
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,481
If he gives you any grief,
you come and see me.

256
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,693
And this guy you know.

257
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,820
Papa Joe.

258
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,950
I told him he should make you best man
but he had to go with his brother.

259
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,829
Best-looking guy in any room.
Great to see you!

260
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,873
- All right.
- Hey, that'll do.

261
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,833
Scotty. Scotty, that'll do.

262
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,126
Sorry.

263
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:16,381
Remember, it is the duty of the best
man to dance with the maid of honor.

264
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,634
Dance. You can't dance.

265
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,514
- When did you learn to dance?
- I've got moves you've never seen.

266
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,851
You're an impostor.

267
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,563
What did you do with
my best friend?

268
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,774
I'm still your best friend.

269
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,861
You just haven't
seen me for a while.

270
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,912
All I'm saying is that some people
might find perfection boring...

271
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,455
...day after day.

272
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,208
See, that's what I thought. How can
you like someone that perfect?

273
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,587
No potential for
long-range likeability.

274
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,299
But then, she does have
a few good traits.

275
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,051
Such as?

276
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,719
They got him.

277
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,347
When I hug her...

278
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,892
...even in public, I don't
have to let go right away.

279
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,519
She lets me hold her
as long as I want.

280
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,231
What?

281
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,691
Nothing.

282
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,693
Yeah, I forgot.

283
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:23,698
You and that yucky love stuff. You get
like that when it gets sentimental.

284
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,575
I do not.

285
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,410
Okay.

286
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,330
Well, when we were...
When you and I were...

287
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,540
- When we were...
- Together?

288
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,709
Yeah?

289
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,463
Well, did I, when...?

290
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,965
Yes.

291
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,717
Yes, what?

292
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,845
Yes, you pulled away when I
tried to hug you in public.

293
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,478
Well, I've changed.

294
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,773
I mean, I'm not the
girl that I once was.

295
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,984
Really?

296
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,029
Any relationship over two
weeks I should know about?

297
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,032
This is not about
longevity, Michael.

298
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,535
This is about...

299
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,121
...being comfortable...

300
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,165
...with the yucky love stuff.

301
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,753
All right!

302
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,255
And I am.

303
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,314
- Karaoke! How'd you find this place?
- The doorman told me.

304
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,317
And you are singing the song.

305
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,666
I didn't realize this
was a karaoke bar.

306
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,294
This is so great.
My two best girls.

307
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,712
You folks thirsty?

308
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,380
- Margarita.
- Margarita.

309
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,174
- Blended, no salt.
- Straight up.

310
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,925
- And you?
- Amstel Light.

311
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,635
Two words for you.

312
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,554
Margarita.

313
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,931
Vespa.

314
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,518
- Florence.
- Yeah!

315
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,314
- Me hanging on in the rain all night.
- I love Florence.

316
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,524
And the guy with the thing...

317
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,195
"Where is my pass?"

318
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,073
- "No, the pier is for fishing!"
- "French kissing?"

319
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:32,202
- "Fishing! Fishing!"
- You know, I've always loved Florence.

320
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,662
You should take her there.

321
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,582
She's perky. She
deserves a honeymoon.

322
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,335
- Oh, yeah, well...
- Oh, yeah, well...

323
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,755
If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento?

324
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,006
What is that?

325
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,885
You're off the road in September,
and when does fall quarter start?

326
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,641
I'm not coming back senior year.

327
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,689
Don't architects find
a degree sort of...

328
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,358
...an asset?

329
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:08,029
I travel every week. College ball,
motor sports, training camps.

330
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,199
The most important thing
is for us to be together.

331
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,369
Say, Pinky, I wanna
hear you sing.

332
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,079
- No, thank you.
- Come on!

333
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,124
No, no, Kimmy hates to sing.
She hates it.

334
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,293
Oh, yeah?

335
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,420
- All right, folks.
- Michael.

336
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,967
My bride-to-be here is about
to kick some ass on...

337
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,053
- What? No, it'll be fun! It'll be fun.
- No, no, no.

338
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:35,682
Michael, she doesn't want to.
Leave her alone. Come on.

339
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,058
Ladies and gentlemen...

340
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,937
...please give it up for the
dazzling vocal stylings of...

341
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,398
...Miss Kimberly Wallace.

342
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,445
Come on!

343
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,311
You suck!

344
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,274
Next!

345
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,492
Shut up!

346
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,850
All right.

347
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,624
All right! All right!

348
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,960
Oh, my God!

349
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,964
That was just terrible.
Terrible!

350
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,351
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately.

351
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,103
Maybe we don't have to go.

352
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,230
Your grandma's dinner?
As bride-to-be...

353
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,607
...she's got you
on a technicality.

354
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,693
I'd babysit you...

355
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,405
...but my loyalty is to the
bride in her time of need.

356
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,617
- It's not really a time of need.
- Well, okay, if you're sure.

357
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,328
Sure?

358
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,164
I'll stay with Michael
if you're sure.

359
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,083
Okay.

360
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,587
- Call me later?
- Of course.

361
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,884
Goodbye.

362
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,594
Have fun!

363
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,941
You were pretty shocked
when I told you, huh?

364
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,818
Shocked? No.

365
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,823
- A little.
- Okay.

366
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,283
A lot.

367
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,285
I fell off the bed.

368
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,705
Well, that explains the thump.

369
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,833
You like her, don't you?

370
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,128
Yeah, I do.

371
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:38,216
- Well, that's enthusiastic.
- Well, I mean, no, she's...

372
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,467
She's great.

373
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,761
"No, she's great."

374
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:46,265
I mean, seriously
can't sing a note.

375
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,934
But...

376
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,647
- ...to make that kind of sacrifice...
- What?

377
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,692
- Leaving school?
- All of it.

378
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,488
Putting her career on hold to follow
you around on this dumb job...

379
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,659
...where you travel 52 weeks
a year to places like...

380
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,536
...College Station, Texas.

381
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,954
Dumb job?

382
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,790
Well, it's not a
grown-up job, Michael.

383
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,376
My job never
bothered you before.

384
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,878
It doesn't bother me now...

385
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,422
...but I'm not Kimmy.

386
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,509
Her father owns the
Sox and cable sports.

387
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,094
Yeah.

388
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,557
I'm just surprised it
hasn't come up, that's all.

389
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,185
What "it"? What?

390
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,188
Corner office with a view.

391
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,858
You in a nice blue suit.

392
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,776
Permanent Chicago address...

393
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,572
- ...somewhat close to Mom and Dad.
- No. Never.

394
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,199
She would never
even think of that.

395
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,744
You don't know her.

396
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,714
- But Michael loves his job.
- Sure.

397
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,800
Bad games, bad pay, bad
towns, bad flights...

398
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,344
...bad hotels, real bad food...

399
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,305
...homeless, rootless, lonely.

400
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:11,726
Your copy makes it in one issue
out of four. What's not to love?

401
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,896
Why would he trade all
that for running, say...

402
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:19,442
...a piece of the PR at a powerful
complex conglomerate like your dad's?

403
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,695
That's just the sort of thing
my father and I discussed.

404
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,739
I'm not surprised.

405
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:30,161
- So do you think he'd really accept?
- Michael, a job like that?

406
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:34,081
It'd be the greatest thing
that ever happened to him.

407
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,292
Present company excepted.

408
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,585
This is what we do.

409
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:43,299
We make your dad a co-conspirator.
Michael does a favor for Walter.

410
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,677
Walter's reorganizing his
public relations and needs...

411
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:51,057
...a brilliant guy that he's close
to that he can completely trust.

412
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,976
Then you beg: "Michael,
please do this for Daddy.

413
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,688
It's only six months. It
would mean so much to me."

414
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,609
He'll see right through it.

415
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,445
Only if he wants to.

416
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,282
At the end of six
months, he will be...

417
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,575
...happy...

418
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,369
...settled...

419
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,204
...successful.

420
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,639
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

421
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,809
- You have a date later or something?
- Never can tell.

422
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,189
Remember?

423
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,943
Okay, kid. You're up.

424
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,081
Well, it's really my father
who needs the favor.

425
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:04,171
You see, he's reorganizing some
of the divisions of the company.

426
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,717
Public relations is a real
problem area for him.

427
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,096
It would only be...

428
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,889
...six months, maybe.

429
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,851
Or three or four.

430
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,769
And you knew about this?

431
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,941
Well, I think you ought to listen to her.
It's her life too.

432
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,572
Well, you gonna tell me that
Walter thought this one up?

433
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,159
Why don't you start by being
honest one second, Kim?

434
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,037
I am being honest.

435
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,498
What, all of a sudden I'm
supposed to drop out of school?

436
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,878
Forget my family, forget my career,
forget everything I ever planned for?

437
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:48,966
Forgive me for screwing up your plans.
Glad I heard this before it's too late.

438
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,303
- What does that mean?
- What about my life?

439
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,473
I work in a low-paying,
zero-respect job...

440
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,392
...which, unfortunately,
I happen to love.

441
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,649
Michael, it sounds like
a great opportunity.

442
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,609
Does it really?

443
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,237
How come you never took some
sell-out establishment job?

444
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,490
Because that isn't you.

445
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,409
- It's not me either.
- If that's how you feel...

446
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,205
Damn straight that's how I feel!
Just come out and say it.

447
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,708
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.

448
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:23,959
I never said that!

449
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:26,962
Yes, you did.

450
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,675
Great, Kim.

451
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,219
Two days before our wedding
you lay this on me...

452
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,721
...and I'm supposed to
just roll over and drool.

453
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,723
No.

454
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,978
I'm an insensitive, sexist asshole.
You're better off without me.

455
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,356
No, Michael, no!

456
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,233
You're so...

457
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,068
...so right.

458
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,569
It was so wrong.

459
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,989
We settled this and I reneged.
That just wasn't fair.

460
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,452
You must forgive me and forget this
ever happened or I'll just die.

461
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,954
Please.

462
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,585
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,963
I'm sorry.

464
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,173
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

465
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,654
- George...
- And Werner...

466
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,905
Are not in.

467
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,991
Brevity is the order of the day.

468
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,493
George! Answer this, damn it!

469
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,830
I'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!

470
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,041
The little twerp groveled.

471
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,418
She's so wrong for him.

472
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,795
Michael and I are
the same person:

473
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,131
Self-absorbed and
vaguely loveable.

474
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,591
We deserve each other.

475
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,510
I'm running out of
time and sneaky ideas.

476
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,847
I have come to the end of
my rapidly fraying rope.

477
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,309
George, you have got
to think of something!

478
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,148
- Coffee, anyone?
- Yes.

479
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,568
- Black. That would be wonderful.
- Decaf.

480
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,534
The plane! The plane!

481
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,802
- Good morning, Tattoo.
- Good morning, boss.

482
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,056
- Oh, isn't it a glorious morning?
- I've seen better.

483
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,978
George!

484
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,856
This is very Marcel Marceau.

485
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,236
Now, relax. Relax. We don't want
your face coming off with it.

486
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,113
What a hideous room.

487
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,576
God! Death by minibar.
How glamorous, huh?

488
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,999
You flew all the way here.
You hate to fly.

489
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:13,379
I must return tonight for a thing
with Werner's family in the Hamptons.

490
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,089
You're butting in.

491
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,885
What I mean when I say she's
annoyingly perfect...

492
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,097
...is there's nothing annoying
about her perfection.

493
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,683
It is vulnerable and endearing.

494
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,726
And that is annoying as shit.

495
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,603
You like her.

496
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:32,773
If I didn't have to hate
her, I'd adore her.

497
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,442
This is my whole
life's happiness.

498
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,862
I have to be ruthless.

499
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,492
He was in love with me for nine years.
I can make him happier than she can.

500
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:48,455
I am breaking her heart in the short
run but really doing her a favor.

501
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,294
She would be so miserable tagging
along after this insensitive doofus.

502
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,427
Jules.

503
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,054
Do you really love him...

504
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,309
...or is this just about winning?
Seriously.

505
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,315
In the beginning,
it was mostly...

506
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:18,402
...this prior claim.
He belonged to me.

507
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,533
But now, when I'm with him...

508
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,245
He's just so wonderful.

509
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,207
How come I never knew that
when I could've had him?

510
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:36,795
It's amazing the clarity that
comes with psychotic jealousy.

511
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,675
George, believe me...

512
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:47,222
...if he was feeling what I'm feeling,
then he would know how it feels.

513
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,933
It's horrible.

514
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,185
What?

515
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,772
Just tell him you love him.

516
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,943
Julianne. Tell him...

517
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,820
Tell him you've loved
him for nine years...

518
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,323
...but you were afraid of love.

519
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,536
Tell him you were afraid of
love, afraid of needing.

520
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,373
- Needing what?
- To belong to someone.

521
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,541
We all are, sweetheart.

522
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,627
I'm sorry about that.

523
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,712
Tell him...

524
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,467
...this is the worst, cruelest,
dumbest moment to do this to him...

525
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,637
...but there it is.
He's gotta choose.

526
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,599
Tell him the actual truth?

527
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,979
Maybe not the actual truth.

528
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,855
Highlights.

529
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,734
George.

530
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,616
- Arms at your sides, please.
- Okay.

531
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,964
- Good morning.
- Michael, I have to talk to you.

532
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,549
You don't like the suit.

533
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,968
Actually, no. But that's not it.

534
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,345
One thing first, though.
Excuse me.

535
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,770
Guard this with your life.

536
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,147
What is it?

537
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:19,565
The ring.

538
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,152
- Why are you giving it to me?
- I don't trust Scotty with it.

539
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,903
- I don't think I...
- Please.

540
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,948
Please, you're practically
the best man anyway.

541
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,284
Here, open it.

542
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,329
She'll like it, won't she?

543
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,292
Yes.

544
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,048
- So, what did you wanna talk about?
- What?

545
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,717
You wanted to talk to
me about something?

546
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:51,013
Yes. Michael...

547
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,725
...we've known each other a long
time, right? What, 20 years?

548
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,311
- Not that long, but a long time.
- Yeah.

549
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,313
And in that time...

550
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,898
...we've grown...

551
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,651
...close.

552
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,654
Very close. Do you know
what I mean by close?

553
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,074
- I think so.
- Okay, good. So do I.

554
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,034
So...

555
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,661
...sometimes whe...

556
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,706
Could you excuse us?

557
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,546
Sometimes...

558
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,007
...people think...

559
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,760
...they know how they
feel about each other...

560
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,345
...but they don't...

561
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,389
...until...

562
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,434
Until they do.

563
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,687
I have a point.

564
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,941
The question is,
can I get to it?

565
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,778
Whatever it is you have to say
can't be that big a deal.

566
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,115
Oh, Michael. You know...

567
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,117
..."big deal" is...

568
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,452
...a relative term.

569
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,802
Who's that guy?

570
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,766
It's George. George. I've told you
about George. He's my editor.

571
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,144
What's he doing here? You
working this weekend?

572
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,812
No.

573
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,524
He's here to be with me.

574
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,817
Why?

575
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,906
Because he's my friend.
He's my good friend.

576
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,201
My best friend these days and...

577
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,998
You've been busy.

578
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,626
So...

579
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,462
...all of this has
been about George?

580
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,235
I'm speechless.

581
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,070
- Well, that's Jules.
- Yeah.

582
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,947
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

583
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,449
What?

584
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:20,829
I told him, puppy. If we're engaged,
we really shouldn't be ashamed of it.

585
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,709
He's racing back to New York. He
came in for a few hours to...

586
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,085
...to...

587
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,545
...fuck me.

588
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,010
Takes a few hours.

589
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,598
God.

590
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,686
- Give me your ring. Give it to me!
- No.

591
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:48,398
George, when you ask a girl to marry
you, you have to give a ring.

592
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,108
How can you do this to me?

593
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,778
I came all this way to help.
You're insane!

594
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,322
Please, for one day
find me irresistible.

595
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,083
Stop it!

596
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,296
Is something wrong?

597
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:17,261
I guess it's just the way you've
always talked about George.

598
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,681
It always seemed...

599
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,100
Seemed like...

600
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,560
It sounded like George was...

601
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,022
- Gay?
- Actually, yes.

602
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,776
Common misconception.

603
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,406
It is, because...

604
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:42,369
...George likes to
pretend that he's gay.

605
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,544
And why would you do that?

606
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,880
Oh, I find it attracts women.

607
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,340
Indeed, yes.

608
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,633
Worked for me.

609
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,635
Bigtime.

610
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,640
Right.

611
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,566
Oh, my God. Race
you to the altar.

612
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,943
- Underplay.
- Got it.

613
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,612
Hey! I'm Jules' fiancé, George.

614
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:21,950
Just in town for a quick pre-conjugal
visit. If you catch my drift?

615
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,452
I do.

616
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,205
- You're gonna humiliate me, right?
- Only if I can.

617
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,875
- Just one thing. Stay away from...
- What?!

618
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,836
George! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

619
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,175
Oh, my God! I don't know
why I'm so carried away!

620
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,304
It's so... It's so... I don't...

621
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,431
Against God's plan?

622
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,392
Oh, no. It's just wonderful!

623
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:50,228
It's wonderful!

624
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,776
- Mom!
- Mom!

625
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,320
Mom!

626
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:01,740
- What?
- You have to meet George.

627
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,951
- George.
- You must be Kimmy's little sister.

628
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,245
Julianne's fiancé. They're
gonna be married.

629
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,538
- No.
- Yes.

630
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,748
What's going on?

631
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,667
- She's getting married.
- Why didn't you tell us?

632
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,961
- There hadn't been time.
- I wanted to.

633
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,465
I wanted to shout it from the
rooftops, but Jules said:

634
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,634
"Pumpkin, no."

635
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:24,971
This is Kimmy's day. Let's not take
the attention away from Kimmy.

636
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,352
"Dear, sweet, adorable,
chocolate-covered Kimmy."

637
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,021
Those were her very words.

638
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,899
I think I'm gonna cry.

639
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,567
Me too.

640
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,737
This is so sweet of you
to come to our rehearsal.

641
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,781
I insist you stay on to lunch.

642
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,741
- No! Absolutely...
- Love to.

643
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,744
Love the bag, love the shoes,
love everything, love to.

644
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,872
- Thank you.
- Darling, what about your flight?

645
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,499
Cancelled.

646
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,340
I can tell you this now...

647
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,509
...but I was very
worried about you.

648
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,094
About me?

649
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,097
All those stories Michael
told me were hilarious...

650
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,184
...but all those broken
relationships, all those men.

651
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,479
It must've hurt dating so much
and not finding the right one.

652
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:18,984
She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy little me.

653
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,821
All the while, the man of your
dreams is right in front of you.

654
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,534
She's talking about me.

655
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,245
- George?
- Yes, darling.

656
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:35,041
- How did you and Julianne meet?
- George is my editor.

657
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,711
But, poopy, we met a
long time before that.

658
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,797
Actually, it's a
very romantic story.

659
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,383
Would you like to
tell it, sweet pea?

660
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,928
- No, it's private.
- Not anymore.

661
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,390
I first met Julianne...

662
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,560
...in a mental institution.

663
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,230
Julianne was visiting
some French chef...

664
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,943
...she'd sent insane with a bad review.
I was there visiting Dionne Warwick.

665
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,361
Dionne Warwick?

666
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,780
Well, yes, he thought
he was Dionne Warwick.

667
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,908
Who is Dionne Warwick?

668
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,620
- Sacrilege, darling.
- She's Whitney Houston's aunt.

669
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,122
She's very good on
the Psychic Friends.

670
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:15,499
Isn't she?

671
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,969
So there I was with Dionne,
whose real name is Jerry...

672
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,096
...having one hell
of a sing-song.

673
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,556
Then suddenly...

674
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,393
...breezing through the doors from
the electric shock therapy room...

675
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,978
...I saw her.

676
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,522
A vision...

677
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:39,814
...in pink.

678
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,775
Pink.

679
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,485
You don't wear pink.

680
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,488
She does, Michael. Sometimes
she does wear pink.

681
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,406
- George.
- You do.

682
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,866
I do.

683
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,160
I said to Dionne:

684
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,121
"Dionne, who is this vision?"

685
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,334
Surely she must be the understudy
to some fabulous Broadway star.

686
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:03,338
Look at her skin. Who does her
hair?" In that moment, I knew.

687
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,383
- We don't all need to know what...
- Yes, we do!

688
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,304
I'm very curious.

689
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,973
They do.

690
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,891
I knew...

691
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,603
...that someday we'd
end up like this.

692
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,397
Like some...

693
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,648
...glittering...

694
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:25,527
...Doris Day-Rock
Hudson extravaganza.

695
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:28,572
I said to Dionne:

696
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,825
"Dionne, I'm in love."

697
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,202
Could this siren love me?

698
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,997
"Are the gods that kind?"

699
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,375
And Dionne turned to me...

700
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,336
...opened her lovely
eyes and said...

701
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,344
What'd she say?

702
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,807
All right.

703
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,024
All right, now!

704
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,863
- Well, heartbreak for you, actually.
- You've made your point.

705
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,114
Get on the plane.

706
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,200
I'll call at the turn of the
century when I've forgiven you.

707
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,077
Jules.

708
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,749
- It would've never worked out.
- Because it was dishonest.

709
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,417
Different temperaments.

710
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,504
Look...

711
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,298
...tell him you love him.

712
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,176
Bite the bullet.

713
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,849
George.

714
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,314
What will he do?

715
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,158
He'll choose Kim.

716
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,703
You'll stand beside
her at the wedding...

717
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,830
...kiss him goodbye...

718
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,874
...and go home.

719
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,628
That's what you came here to do.

720
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,547
So do it.

721
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,150
George isn't my fiancé, Michael.

722
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:38,571
It's been over for ages,
but he can't accept it.

723
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,989
I'd...

724
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:44,702
...built you up so much I couldn't
let him lose face in front of you.

725
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:50,208
He could never stack up to the one
man I measure everyone against.

726
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,758
I don't know, this is strange.

727
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:02,512
I gotta tell you when you...

728
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,640
When you told me that you
were marrying George...

729
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,854
...I got this really strange...

730
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,859
You were jealous?

731
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,825
Crazy jealous.

732
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,537
I'm sorry.

733
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:37,338
Can we, maybe, spend some
time alone this afternoon?

734
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,343
Would that be all right?

735
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,276
This is built in the art
deco style of the 1920s.

736
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:03,781
In the centre the building is set back
for light to come down to the city.

737
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:14,876
I've been thinking a lot the last
couple of days. About us, I mean.

738
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,670
Have you?

739
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,009
There are a lot of
memories to choose from.

740
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,385
It's more than that.

741
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,181
I mean...

742
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,184
...it's kind of embarrassing
to say it this way...

743
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,313
...but you've sort
of been, you know...

744
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,607
...the woman in my life.

745
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:42,195
You've been the man in mine.

746
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:46,199
And I was thinking this
could be our last time...

747
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,077
...alone together, you know?

748
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,290
Except for that hot affair
we'll have twice a year.

749
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,209
Except for that.

750
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,009
I mean...

751
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,637
...you commit to this wedding...

752
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:09,764
...and then...

753
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,726
...it seems like
this momentum...

754
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,062
...and then you
forget you chose it.

755
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,945
You and I didn't...

756
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,448
I mean, in our relationships
with other people...

757
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:32,787
...we didn't use the word
"love" a lot, did we?

758
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,501
Kimmy says if you
love someone...

759
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,294
...you say it.

760
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,965
You say it right then, out loud.

761
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,384
Otherwise...

762
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,011
...the moment just...

763
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,264
- Passes you by.
- Passes you by.

764
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,830
We don't even have a song.

765
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,791
Kimmy and I...

766
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,294
...we don't have a song.

767
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,505
You think that's a bad sign?

768
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,198
Is your dance card filled?

769
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,701
I'd have to check. I keep
it on PowerBook these days.

770
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,203
Is that right?

771
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,891
Yeah, if you go with a
6-percent dividend.

772
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,144
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.

773
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,396
- Hi.
- Hi.

774
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,314
Michael's not coming?

775
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:08,276
I said I'd drop you at the stag.
He's so busy.

776
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,904
- Sort of unofficial best man.
- Yes, of course.

777
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:17,785
Well, Kim said when Michael turned the
job down that there was no friction.

778
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,412
Friction? No.

779
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,164
Good.

780
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,500
I haven't caused a
problem, have I?

781
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,628
No, you haven't!
Well, nobody has.

782
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,424
Listen, you're just
a little bit early.

783
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,342
I need to make some calls.

784
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,179
- Is it possible to use your office?
- Of course.

785
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,098
- At the end of the hall on the left.
- Thank you.

786
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,642
Take your time.

787
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,319
E-mail.

788
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:56,866
New letter.

789
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:08,002
To Eric Isaacson.

790
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,546
Senior Editor...

791
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,841
...Sport Magazine.

792
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,010
From...

793
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,721
...Walter Wallace.

794
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,517
You can do this. It's easy. Just
do it fast, get it over with.

795
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,728
It's like it never happened.

796
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,022
"Eric..."

797
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,650
...I need a favor.

798
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,485
My daughter's...

799
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,987
...every happiness...

800
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,781
...is in your hands.

801
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,743
I have offered Mike O'Neal...

802
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,246
...my new son-in-law...

803
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:48,334
...a great opportunity
in my company.

804
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:52,004
To his own detriment...

805
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,633
...Michael will not accept...

806
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,510
...our offer...

807
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:01,889
...while he works for you.

808
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,959
My daughter joins
me in this plea...

809
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,629
...for your cooperation.

810
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,965
With gratitude...

811
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,758
"...Walter."

812
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:44,181
Why would I send this?
He'd get fired.

813
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,726
No.

814
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:54,066
Save for later.

815
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,409
It's not like I'm sending it. I'm
just saving it for a few hours...

816
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,579
...till we come back here...

817
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,497
...and Michael can see it.

818
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,875
Perfectly harmless.

819
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,840
- They were all there.
- What about Bill's reaction?

820
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,135
I don't think he was happy
with his 10-percent cut.

821
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,680
Send out this, this,
not this, this.

822
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,641
- That's it.
- Okay.

823
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:13,062
Also, I'm holding four or five e-mails
I wrote over lunch. Send those out.

824
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:14,397
Yes, sir.

825
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,357
- Bye.
- Bye.

826
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,067
All set?

827
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,446
I can't believe this!
Did you try every key?

828
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,949
No big deal. She gave
us the wrong keys.

829
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,828
No, no, there's got to be
a janitor, or a guard...

830
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,373
...or a cleaning woman or,
you know, some kind of...

831
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:37,211
Somebody has to be in this building!
I need a brick. I just need a brick.

832
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:40,381
What's the big deal about
getting this file tonight?

833
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,258
I have a deadline.

834
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,760
Me too, I'm getting
married tomorrow.

835
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,262
That's my point!

836
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:49,682
Everybody's gonna be so busy
with more important things.

837
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:51,434
It's really my last chance.

838
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:55,187
If I could get up to Walter's
office, they're by the computer.

839
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,940
I could just e-mail
those figures out.

840
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,400
Tomorrow's Sunday.

841
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,610
Nobody's doing business.

842
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,614
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
Walter will walk you up there.

843
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,201
Give it up, kid.

844
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,329
Can't win them all.

845
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,511
Good night.

846
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,558
Jules.

847
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:40,065
- This thing mean that much to you?
- Yes.

848
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:43,652
Come on.

849
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:47,740
We'll use the phone in your room.
Walter's probably not even asleep.

850
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,074
Thank you!

851
01:03:49,284 --> 01:03:53,120
We'll get the right key and we'll
go back down to the office.

852
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,498
If I fall asleep on
the altar tomorrow...

853
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,750
-...you better be there...
- I'll be there!

854
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,044
These are all from Eric.

855
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,255
This fax is from Eric too.

856
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,633
You'd think my boss
would leave me alone.

857
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,177
Maybe it's a congratulations.

858
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,314
What is it?

859
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:31,784
"I can't believe I'm doing this to you
on the night before your wedding...

860
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:36,497
...but I think you need and deserve
to know what you're marrying into."

861
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:44,463
"I received the following
e-mail this afternoon:

862
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,301
'Eric, I need a favor. My
daughter's every... "'

863
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,847
- Hello?
- Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.

864
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,849
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

865
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,186
I'm just tired. Please put her on.
Thanks.

866
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,355
Jules...

867
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,483
Could you give me a minute?

868
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,028
Please?

869
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,704
Excuse me, miss. Are
you locked out?

870
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,832
No. No, no.

871
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,419
Just stepped out. It's
a no-smoking room.

872
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,923
Well, it's a
non-smoking floor too.

873
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:13,552
Maybe you could go
down to the lobby.

874
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,888
Why don't you have me arrested?

875
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,391
I mean it.

876
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,729
I am a dangerous
criminal person.

877
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,942
I do bad things
to honest people.

878
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,489
Make a citizen's arrest.
I wouldn't struggle.

879
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,659
It'd be like getting Al
Capone on tax evasion.

880
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,669
Can I help you, miss?

881
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,426
Do you smoke, Richard?

882
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,429
Yes, I do, but...

883
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,224
- It's a non-smoking floor.
- Yep.

884
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,977
But you know what?

885
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,876
You know...

886
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,880
...my grandmother always said:

887
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,969
"This too shall pass."

888
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:41,765
Thanks, Richard.

889
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,877
I want you to quit this shit.

890
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,171
It'll kill you.

891
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,010
What happened?

892
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,764
It's over.

893
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,934
She denied it. She said I
was crazy and paranoid.

894
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,645
A bad combination.

895
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,856
There's a big...

896
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:34,067
...brunch tomorrow morning
at her parents' house.

897
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,613
She said, "How can I call it off?
How can I...?"

898
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,159
"What am I supposed
to tell everyone?"

899
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:45,788
- Michael.
- No, it's for the best. It really is.

900
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,248
She was right.

901
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,419
I am crazy...

902
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,800
...to fall for someone
I hardly knew.

903
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,973
I'm so glad you're here.

904
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:15,359
Hey, you still got that ring?

905
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,122
I tried it on and
it won't come off.

906
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:12,291
Why don't we take a walk or have
some food sent up or something?

907
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,879
I just wanna be alone.

908
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:21,216
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

909
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,263
Maybe... Maybe...

910
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:29,266
Maybe I'll go back to New
York and hang with you.

911
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,144
Eric will understand.
Or we could...

912
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:35,439
...go somewhere if you want.

913
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:40,027
If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento...

914
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,155
I've never been to Texas.

915
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:54,434
You what?!

916
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,751
- Can I try that?
- Yeah, sure.

917
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,014
- Excuse me.
- Good luck.

918
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,102
Is this how you call
off the wedding?

919
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:41,023
I came to confront everyone. I'm
not slinking away like a coward.

920
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,860
Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
I don't know what to do.

921
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,071
There is a wedding at 6:00.

922
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,913
Have you changed your mind?

923
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,958
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

924
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,629
I made a decision.

925
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,798
It's over.

926
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,177
I'll go tell them.

927
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,139
First...

928
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,642
...do you think she's all right?

929
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:20,062
Maybe you could go
check on her for me.

930
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,319
These are the most beautiful
flowers I've ever seen.

931
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,491
How is he?

932
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,329
He's sort of wondering...

933
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:41,083
...why you haven't told your
parents that the wedding's off.

934
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,543
I don't know.

935
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,213
I'm still hoping for a
miracle, I suppose.

936
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,716
How could he think my father
and I would do such a thing?

937
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,345
I only minored in psych,
you understand...

938
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:56,556
...but maybe Michael...

939
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:01,937
...couldn't commit to this marriage,
so he created a delusion.

940
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:06,900
Produced an unconscious,
psychosomatic manifestation of...

941
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,363
I'm better with food.

942
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,490
Okay.

943
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,367
You are Michael.

944
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,953
You're in a fancy
French restaurant.

945
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,247
You order...

946
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,000
...crème brûlée for dessert.

947
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,461
It's beautiful.

948
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:27,879
It's sweet.

949
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,466
It's irritatingly perfect.

950
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:34,219
Suddenly, Michael realizes...

951
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:36,972
...he doesn't want crème brûlée.

952
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,058
He wants something else.

953
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,893
What does he want?

954
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,814
Jell-O.

955
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,774
Jell-O?

956
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:51,945
- Why does he want Jell-O?
- Because he's comfortable with Jell-O.

957
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:55,323
Jell-O makes him comfortable.

958
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:59,411
I realize compared to crème
brûlée it's Jell-O...

959
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,164
...but maybe that's
what he needs.

960
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,583
- I could be Jell-O.
- No.

961
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,712
Crème brûlée can
never be Jell-O.

962
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,631
You could never be Jell-O.

963
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,843
- I have to be Jell-O.
- You're never gonna be Jell-O.

964
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:19,347
Tell your parents. If you're waiting for
that "Do you take this man" part...

965
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,350
- ...it's considered poor form.
- I love him.

966
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,856
Whatever delusions I drove Michael to,
there's truth at the heart of it.

967
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,234
You see, I want him to
work for my father.

968
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:35,322
I want to stay in school. And
I want a life of my own.

969
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:39,284
Please, tell him that it's my
fault and that I love him.

970
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:43,163
You're the only
person that I trust.

971
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,588
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

972
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,603
How is she?

973
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:08,980
Hey, knock it off!

974
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,774
Yes, sir.

975
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:14,819
- I asked...
- She admits that it's her fault.

976
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,697
Totally, completely,
inexcusably her fault.

977
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,078
Think she still loves me?

978
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,083
Love...

979
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:33,171
It's a strong word, and I don't know
that I'm necessarily qualified...

980
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:36,591
I wouldn't be totally off base
if I said that in her way...

981
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,511
-...she does possess strong feelings...
- Jules!

982
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,519
Sure she does, Michael.

983
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,105
She's crazy about you.

984
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,667
Tell her I'll marry
her at 6:00...

985
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:13,545
...if she'll still have me.

986
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,132
Please.

987
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,640
I'll be right...

988
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:27,934
Right back.

989
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,205
What did he say?

990
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,713
He said:

991
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,509
"Marry me."

992
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,476
- Thank God you were here.
- Yeah.

993
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,728
I got so confused.

994
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,396
It happens.

995
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,899
Got a minute?

996
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,486
What's up?

997
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,626
I have to say this quick or I'll
just have a massive coronary...

998
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,504
...and then you'll never
hear it and you have to.

999
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:41,966
This is, by far, the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.

1000
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:44,886
So dumb, in fact...

1001
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,930
...that I can't...

1002
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,516
- Oh, but I'm gonna.
- What's wrong?

1003
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:55,146
Michael.

1004
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:58,691
I love you.

1005
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:03,488
I've loved you for nine years. I've
been too arrogant and scared...

1006
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,200
...to realize it. Well,
now I'm just scared so...

1007
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,162
I realize this comes at a
very inopportune time...

1008
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,542
...but I really have this
gigantic favor to ask of you.

1009
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:20,547
Choose me. Marry me.

1010
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,049
Let me make you happy.

1011
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:28,471
That sounds like three
favors, doesn't it? But...

1012
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,205
Kim!

1013
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,752
- Kim!
- Michael!

1014
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,713
Kim!

1015
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,590
- Michael!
- Kim!

1016
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,717
Michael!

1017
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,261
Kim!

1018
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:11,764
- They look lovely together.
- Aren't they?

1019
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,433
Kim!

1020
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,101
Michael!

1021
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,811
That's our maid of honor.

1022
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,147
She's from New York.

1023
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,234
- Kim! Kim!
- Michael!

1024
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,241
Kim!

1025
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,874
Michael. Michael, wait!
Michael, wait!

1026
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,502
Please! You'll never catch her!

1027
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,298
Doesn't anybody leave
their car unlocked?

1028
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:48,134
Nobody trusts anybody anymore?

1029
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,637
A Good Samaritan.

1030
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,020
Hey, come back here!

1031
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,774
"Shy tendrils of
russet pleasure..."

1032
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:06,069
...began their unbidden journey.

1033
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:08,655
She moaned.

1034
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:12,492
"The tonnage of years of
anguish, sacrifice..."

1035
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,703
- Yes?
- It is not going well!

1036
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,874
This is what comes of telling
the truth, or even part of it!

1037
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,169
- Getting what you deserve isn't fair!
- Where are you?

1038
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:27,131
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm
chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue.

1039
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:32,303
George, this is your fault! I told him
that I loved him and I kissed him.

1040
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,973
- And this is what's happened.
- Jules, a question.

1041
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,976
When you kissed Michael,
did he kiss you back?

1042
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,186
What do you mean?
We were lip to lip!

1043
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,397
Was there anything
in the kiss...

1044
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:45,650
...to lead you to believe
this chase will end happily?

1045
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,611
- Beside the point. We were interrupted.
- By whom?

1046
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,824
Kimmy! And Michael started chasing
her before he could answer me.

1047
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,492
- Michael's chasing Kimmy?
- Yes.

1048
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,327
- You're chasing Michael?
- Yes.

1049
01:21:56,829 --> 01:22:00,164
Who's chasing you? Nobody. Get it?
There's your answer: Kimmy.

1050
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:03,251
- No!
- Yes! Jules, you are not the one!

1051
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:07,380
Now, for God's sake, the
wedding is at 6 p.m.

1052
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:11,843
You have a small but distinct window
of opportunity to do the right thing.

1053
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,930
George!

1054
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:43,958
Where you going?

1055
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:45,793
All aboard!

1056
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,672
Michael!

1057
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,779
I have a confession to make.

1058
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:58,032
Another confession.

1059
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:07,625
Besides that I love you,
this is even worse.

1060
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:18,261
The e-mail that Walter
sent to your boss...

1061
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,517
...I wrote that.

1062
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:29,981
I'm the bad guy.

1063
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,234
Are you crazy?

1064
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:36,529
Jules, are you completely insane?
I mean...

1065
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:41,325
I mean, Jules, how
could you do that?!

1066
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:46,205
Michael. It wasn't supposed to get sent.
I just...

1067
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,125
I just wanted you to
get mad at Kimmy.

1068
01:24:56,884 --> 01:25:00,011
I've done nothing but
underhanded, despicable...

1069
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:04,348
...not even terribly imaginative
things since I got here.

1070
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,771
I was...

1071
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,776
Michael, I was just trying...

1072
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,112
...to win you.

1073
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,823
To win you back.

1074
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,203
But that doesn't
excuse any of it.

1075
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,789
I'm pond scum.

1076
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:33,586
Well, lower, actually.
I'm like...

1077
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,422
...the fungus that
feeds on pond scum.

1078
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:38,049
Lower.

1079
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,969
The pus...

1080
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,721
...that infects the mucus...

1081
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,848
...that cruds up the fungus...

1082
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,725
...that feeds on the pond scum.

1083
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,568
On the other hand...

1084
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:02,323
...thank you...

1085
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:06,285
...for loving me that much.

1086
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,080
That way...

1087
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,499
...it's pretty flattering.

1088
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:15,253
Except it makes me fungus.

1089
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,713
Well...

1090
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,132
...that part I knew.

1091
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,727
God.

1092
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:38,192
I'm glad you didn't
get on that train.

1093
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:43,239
Well, I came here
looking for her.

1094
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:47,201
Why would she be here?

1095
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,996
This is where I proposed.

1096
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,961
I had to cover a game in
Milwaukee, and she saw me off.

1097
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:01,048
The train was
starting to leave...

1098
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:06,345
...and I jumped up on the
step, and I held the handle.

1099
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:08,431
And without...

1100
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:13,060
...a thought in my head, I
just shouted, "Marry me!"

1101
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:19,358
And the train was pulling out,
and she just suddenly screamed:

1102
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:20,902
"Yes!"

1103
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,697
Just once.

1104
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,034
And blew me a kiss.

1105
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,049
It would've been a nice wedding.

1106
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:48,179
Michael, you can't
believe you've lost her.

1107
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:52,934
You will find her and you'll look
into her eyes and see all that love.

1108
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:57,813
I just hope it's soon. Or else
I'd hate to be you at 6:00.

1109
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,191
Just wait. Wait.

1110
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:01,901
We'll split up.

1111
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:07,114
You will go to every romantic place
the two of you have, and I will go...

1112
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:10,576
...I don't know, someplace
brilliant, and we'll find her.

1113
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,287
We will find her.

1114
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:21,796
- Wallace residence, Mandy speaking.
- Has Kimmy called you guys?

1115
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:24,924
She slipped out, the monkey,
during the commotion.

1116
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:26,884
- Commotion?
- Well...

1117
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:31,847
My sister was licking an ice sculpture
and her tongue froze right to it.

1118
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:35,559
- And that's a commotion?
- It's a sculpture of David.

1119
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,478
So Kimmy would be...?

1120
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:40,731
She's probably with
Michael doing the nasty.

1121
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,567
Either that or crying
down at Comiskey Park.

1122
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:44,819
Excuse me?

1123
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:48,155
I got a crank call from a guy
saying he saw her there.

1124
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,033
- Right.
- What would a bride be doing...?

1125
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:53,119
Right. Listen, can
you bring my dress?

1126
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,955
I gotta pick something
up before the ceremony.

1127
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,749
Okay, don't forget to shave now.

1128
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,253
Here's the hair dryer.

1129
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,380
All right. There we go.

1130
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:08,634
It's gonna be okay. No pictures.
Please, no pictures.

1131
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:21,647
Excuse me.

1132
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,315
- Kimmy?
- Kimmy.

1133
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,568
- Kimmy?
- Kimmy.

1134
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,946
Kimmy, I know you're in here.
The guard saw you.

1135
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,991
Just leave me alone, you bitch!

1136
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:35,077
Kimmy.

1137
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,417
Who the hell do you
think you are?

1138
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,668
Cat fight!

1139
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,629
You came here pretending
to be my friend...

1140
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:47,798
...and I made you
my maid of honor!

1141
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:51,469
Who asked you to do that? You
knew me, what, eight minutes?

1142
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:54,055
Michael trusted you,
so I trusted you.

1143
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,808
You wanted to keep me close. You
didn't trust me for a second.

1144
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:00,352
- I was right.
- Well, of course you were right.

1145
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:03,314
- But that's not my fault.
- You kissed him!

1146
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,566
- At my parents' house!
- That's cold!

1147
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,068
On my wedding day!

1148
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,861
- Bitch!
- Tramp.

1149
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,863
Shut up!

1150
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:12,406
Now I love this man.

1151
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:17,495
There's no way I'm gonna give him
up to some two-faced, big-haired...

1152
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:18,913
...food critic.

1153
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:25,002
Okay, all right! All right!

1154
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,171
I kissed him.

1155
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,465
I...

1156
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:31,967
...tried to steal him.

1157
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,348
I lost.

1158
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,897
He doesn't love me.

1159
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,525
He loves you.

1160
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,864
Kimmy.

1161
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:58,244
I haven't done much that I'm
proud of the last three days.

1162
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,874
I'd like to take you
to the church...

1163
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,211
...so you can walk
down that aisle...

1164
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,548
...and marry the
man of our dreams.

1165
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,301
Because he sure
wants to marry you.

1166
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:08,874
So raise our glasses...

1167
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:12,336
...and wish Mike and
Kim every happiness...

1168
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,922
...for a long and happy
life together...

1169
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,508
...filled with...

1170
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,052
...happiness.

1171
01:33:22,305 --> 01:33:24,098
Well, I guess that's it.

1172
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:25,724
To the bride and groom.

1173
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:27,518
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

1174
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:36,318
Now let's hear from the maid
of honor, the lovely Julianne.

1175
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:48,414
I had the strangest dream.

1176
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:54,837
I dreamt that some psychopath was
trying to break the two of you up.

1177
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,177
Luckily...

1178
01:34:03,346 --> 01:34:05,556
...I woke up and I see...

1179
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:10,769
...that the world is
just as it should be.

1180
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:16,775
For my best friend...

1181
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:20,571
...has won the best woman.

1182
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,250
I didn't get you a gift.

1183
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:36,754
However...

1184
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:40,257
...this is on loan...

1185
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:46,180
...until you two find your song.

1186
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:10,013
- It's mine!
- I don't think so, honey!

1187
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,853
I got it!

1188
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,091
Bye.

1189
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,473
Hello, George.

1190
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,642
Hey, gorgeous,
having a good time?

1191
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:39,895
Not particularly, but I
did what I came to do.

1192
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,772
What? You split them up?

1193
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:43,941
No, I said goodbye.

1194
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,568
Good girl. I'm proud of you.

1195
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:49,112
Be prouder still if
you were dancing.

1196
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:51,365
I have big plans for dancing.

1197
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:55,827
Just give me 30, 35 years.

1198
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:58,539
The misery, the
exquisite tragedy.

1199
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,166
The Susan Hayward of it all.

1200
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:04,962
I can just picture you sitting
alone in your lavender gown.

1201
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:08,006
- I told you my gown was lavender?
- Hair swept up.

1202
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:09,967
Haven't touched your cake.

1203
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:14,137
Probably drumming your fingernails
on the white linen tablecloth.

1204
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:16,473
The way you do when
you feel down.

1205
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:18,308
Perhaps even thinking:

1206
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:22,437
"God, I should've stopped all my
evil plotting to have that manicure.

1207
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:24,314
- "But it's too late now."
- George.

1208
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,984
I didn't tell you my
dress was lavender.

1209
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:29,403
Suddenly, a familiar song.

1210
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,328
And you're off your chair in
one exquisite movement...

1211
01:38:40,248 --> 01:38:42,541
...wondering, searching...

1212
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,586
...sniffing the wind
like a dappled deer.

1213
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,921
Has God heard your
little prayer?

1214
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,591
Will Cinderella dance again?

1215
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:53,343
And then suddenly...

1216
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:55,012
...the crowds part...

1217
01:38:56,723 --> 01:38:58,140
...and there he is.

1218
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:00,851
Sleek...

1219
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:02,519
...stylish...

1220
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,230
...radiant with charisma.

1221
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:06,690
Bizarrely...

1222
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:08,400
...he's on the telephone.

1223
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,735
But then...

1224
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,445
...so are you.

1225
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:15,616
And he comes toward you...

1226
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:18,785
...the moves of a jungle cat.

1227
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:23,123
And although you quite
correctly sense that he is...

1228
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,000
...gay...

1229
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:28,962
...like most devastatingly handsome
single men of his age are...

1230
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:31,882
...you think:

1231
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,176
"What the hell?"

1232
01:39:35,595 --> 01:39:37,095
Life goes on.

1233
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:40,223
Maybe there won't be marriage.

1234
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:42,934
Maybe there won't be sex.

1235
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,479
But, by God...

1236
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:48,106
"...there'll be dancing."

1237
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,002
"Bond. Jane Bond."
