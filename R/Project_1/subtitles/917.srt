1
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:57,347
The film which you are
about to see

2
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:59,357
is an account
of the tragedy

3
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:02,326
which befell a group
of 5 youths.

4
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:06,422
It is all the more tragic
in that they were young,

5
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,797
but had they lived
very, very long lives,

6
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,893
they could not
have expected,

7
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:12,733
nor would they
have wished to see

8
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,867
as much of the mad and macabre
as they were to see that day.

9
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,141
For them, an idyllic summer
afternoon became a nightmare.

10
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:25,445
For 30 years,
the files collected dust

11
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:27,109
in the cold-cases
division

12
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,620
of the travis county
police department.

13
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,120
Over 1,300 pieces
of evidence

14
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,253
were collected
from the crime scene

15
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:39,264
at the hewitt residence.

16
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:50,232
Yet none of the evidence
was more compelling

17
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,300
than the classified
police footage

18
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:55,247
of the crime-scene
walk-through.

19
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,306
Test, test, test.

20
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:00,807
Ok, uh... this
is august 20, 1973.

21
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:03,719
The time is 3:47 p.m.

22
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,192
Our location is the hewitt
residence on route 17.

23
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,228
That's where
victim one was found.

24
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:12,730
We're gonna do
a walk-through,

25
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,233
and we're now
descending the stairs

26
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,236
into the furnace room.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,737
Uh...

28
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,239
there's... over here.

29
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,741
There's scratch marks
along the wall.

30
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:26,234
There's some more over here,
right along here.

31
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,281
And... oh, there's something
over here. It seems like...

32
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:34,753
it looks like a clot of hair
and an embedded fingernail.

33
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,757
All right, we're gonna go move
into the actual furnace room.

34
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,793
The events of that day

35
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,796
were to lead to one
of the most bizarre crimes

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,798
in the annals
of american history...

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,493
the texas
chainsaw massacre.

38
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,803
Hold on! Hold on!

39
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,806
Don't let go!
Not yet! Not yet!

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,831
Yeah! Now! Now!
Let go!

41
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,097
Big wheels keep on turning

42
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,962
would somebody please
make her stop singing?

43
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,263
Carry me home to see my kin

44
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,804
i think you got
a beautiful voice, baby.

45
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,863
Thank you.

46
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,806
Ha!

47
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,777
I miss alabamy once again

48
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,212
and i think
it's a sin, yes

49
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,410
can you believe...

50
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,717
we didn't even know
each other yesterday?

51
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,784
I know.
It's just amazing.

52
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,124
Mmm!

53
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,494
You know what's
even more amazing?

54
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,329
Hello?

55
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,732
Hello?

56
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,236
What are you, like at a pause
or half-time?

57
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,536
Ok, the fact that
33,000 americans each day

58
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,132
are infected with
a sexually-transmitted disease,

59
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,737
and two-thirds of them
are just about your age.

60
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,570
Ha ha!

61
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,841
Hey, morgan.

62
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,979
How are you the expert
on the dumbest shit?

63
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,613
Sweet home alabama

64
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:22,257
lord, i'm coming home to you

65
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,229
what are the odds
of you guys

66
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,734
passing through
el paso

67
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,736
just as i started
to hitch?

68
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,398
I mean, it's like...
synchronicity.

69
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,268
It's like i.s.d.

70
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,403
It's like this shit
does not just happen.

71
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,877
Oh, baby, they got to
play "free bird."

72
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,147
Oh, they have to.

73
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,415
We paid a fortune
for these tickets.

74
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,320
Yo, kemp, can you do something
about the a.c. Back here?

75
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,483
I'm melting.

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,088
No.

77
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,460
But if you or pepper
get too hot,

78
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:57,965
you could always
take your clothes off.

79
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,559
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

80
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,503
You are such a perv.

81
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,268
Don't listen
to him, pepper.

82
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,833
Why not?
I think he's funny.

83
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:12,313
She's only known you
for 19 hours.

84
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,678
I've lived with him
for 3 years,

85
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,182
and trust me,
he is not funny.

86
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,723
Morgan, hey,
let me see that.

87
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,287
Careful, man.

88
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,321
Thank you.
I think

89
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,355
i can manage,
college boy.

90
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,731
Here.

91
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,236
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm nauseous.

92
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,239
Montezuma's revenge.
I was like erin...

93
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,673
"don't drink the water
down there."

94
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,676
I didn't.

95
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,234
And she didn't
drink the tequila,

96
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:44,745
she didn't drink
the weed...

97
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:46,508
smoke the weed.

98
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,782
Well, maybe i
didn't go to mexico

99
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:52,116
to watch you get
shit-faced for 4 days.

100
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,212
That is what people do
when they go to mexico.

101
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,756
What did you expect?

102
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:57,792
I don't know.

103
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:01,227
A tear-cut diamond ring
that goes right here

104
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:03,128
on my beautiful
little finger?

105
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,257
You're gonna get
your ring someday.

106
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,200
I heard
that one before.

107
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:09,396
Peace offering.

108
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:19,645
Oops. Oh...

109
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,809
that was
so not cool.

110
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:23,853
Guys, relax.
It's not like

111
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:24,911
we don't have
2 pounds of...

112
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,581
oh, right.
Shh!

113
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,682
What did you say?

114
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,226
I don't remember.
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,693
I got bad brain cells.

116
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,127
Uh, "2 pounds of pot."

117
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:35,721
Does that refresh
your memory?

118
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:36,891
Don't listen
to him.

119
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:39,059
He's baked,
and he's stupid.

120
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:40,568
Baby, will you
please tell me

121
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,969
that we did not go
to mexico to buy pot?

122
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:46,463
We did not go
to mexico to buy pot.

123
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:49,603
Hey, come on, baby.

124
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:53,604
Look at me. I am not
a dope smuggler, ok?

125
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,913
Tell me how much
you love me.

126
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,043
How much?
That much.

127
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:58,313
This much.
That much?

128
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:00,015
That's it.
That's it.

129
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,920
Ok.
Give me a kiss.

130
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:07,522
Can you drive
possibly, please?

131
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,087
Look out!

132
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,155
Shit!

133
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,962
Oh, shit!

134
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,033
You almost hit her.

135
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,543
What the fuck

136
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,568
was she doing walking
in the middle of the road?

137
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:31,278
Asshole.

138
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:35,814
Hello?
Hey, are you ok?

139
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,223
Boys, that's
a bad acid trip

140
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,454
walking
right there.

141
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,454
Hello?
Can you hear us?

142
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:44,364
You're gonna
get killed doing that.

143
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:48,098
Kemp, stop the van.

144
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,901
Fuck that.
We got a concert to go to.

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,737
We're still 3 fucking
hours from dallas!

146
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,174
Where are you going?

147
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,075
We're getting there.

148
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,239
Get away.

149
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,248
Hey...

150
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,682
just need to get away.

151
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:03,413
What?

152
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,421
Got to get away.

153
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:06,823
From who?

154
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,552
I want to go home.

155
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:10,150
Ok, we can't
leave her

156
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,660
out here
like this.

157
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:13,162
Hey, let us
help you, ok?

158
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,164
Come on.

159
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,166
Come on.
It's ok.

160
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,634
It's ok.

161
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:21,136
It's ok, man.

162
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,605
We'll give you a ride,
wherever you want to go.

163
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,608
I want to go home.

164
00:08:25,642 --> 00:08:27,507
Ok, we can
take you home.

165
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:48,663
Um... what's your name?

166
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:51,189
They're all dead.

167
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:57,598
Oh, my god. I am
way too stoned for this.

168
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:02,036
Baby, let's find
a hospital, ok?

169
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,603
You know what?
Give me the vaguest idea

170
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:05,479
where there is one,
and we'll go there.

171
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,178
Um... who's dead?

172
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:13,456
Kemper, didn't
your mother ever tell you

173
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,220
not to pick up
hitchhikers?

174
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:23,165
No.

175
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:26,602
You're going
the wrong way.

176
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:29,401
Stop! You're
going the wrong way!

177
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,806
Hey, hey, hey!

178
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:40,245
Jesus christ.

179
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:42,411
You can't make me
go back there.

180
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:45,012
I won't go back there.

181
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,057
Back where?

182
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:57,166
He's a bad man.

183
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:00,728
He's a really bad man.

184
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,278
He's a bad man.

185
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,872
Oh, my god.
Oh, shit.

186
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,913
You're all gonna die.

187
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:18,388
Drop it.
Drop it.

188
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:34,828
Let me out!
Oh, my god!

189
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:57,862
Are you
all right?

190
00:10:57,896 --> 00:11:00,296
It's too much.
I'm ok. I'm ok.

191
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:03,733
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my god!

192
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,236
Let me see.

193
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,703
It's all over me!

194
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,706
It's gone.
It's gone. Look.

195
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,332
I could have fucking
died out there!

196
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,400
We all could
have, morgan.

197
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,713
Did that
just happen?

198
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,219
I've never seen
anybody die before.

199
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,983
Yeah, most people
never do.

200
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:25,421
I really don't see

201
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:26,924
how that's helping
us right now, man.

202
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:28,823
I don't know
why we had to pick her up.

203
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,063
Why the fuck
did we have to stop?

204
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,462
She needed help!

205
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,798
A lot of fucking
help we did her!

206
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,963
Leave her alone.

207
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,336
Fuck!

208
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:46,300
I just don't understand.

209
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,813
Why did she do it?

210
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,315
And why did she
have to pick us?

211
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,750
Why did she
have to pick us?

212
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,357
What are we
gonna do?

213
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,764
I don't know.
We're gonna...

214
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:12,070
we're gonna have to
call the cops, i guess.

215
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,232
Yeah, on the list
of bad ideas,

216
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:16,036
that one goes
way up there.

217
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:18,043
Are you kidding me?

218
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:19,408
Oh, police officer,
please,

219
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:20,912
as you inspect
the crime scene,

220
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:22,414
which is now
our van,

221
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:23,938
please ignore
the colorful pinata

222
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,075
filled
with marijuana

223
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:26,449
you may just happen
to come across,

224
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,816
because it played
no part whatsoever

225
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:30,254
in the demise of this
unfortunate young woman.

226
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:33,759
Listen... keep
your goddamn voice down.

227
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:36,294
Easy, easy, easy.

228
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,320
Goddamn it.

229
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,305
Well, you're not gonna
listen to him.

230
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,671
What the fuck
are you doing?

231
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,141
Uh!

232
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,345
It's over, man.

233
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,183
Kemp, you just can't
throw the shit out.

234
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:09,058
You ok?

235
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,563
Baby...

236
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:14,226
i'm sorry, ok? I...

237
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:16,236
i did it for us.

238
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,229
I did it so we could
start a life, you know.

239
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:23,766
I'm sorry. Ok?

240
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,251
Well, i'll tell you this much...
there's no possible way

241
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,051
i'm ever getting back
in that van.

242
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:52,362
I guess that's what
brains look like, huh?

243
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:58,810
Sort of like,
uh... lasagna...

244
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,336
kind of.

245
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,809
All right,
i'll shut up now.

246
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,227
I'll tell you
this much...

247
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,229
the next hitchhiker
is shit out of luck.

248
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:17,993
I swear to god.

249
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,500
Dude, gas station.

250
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:54,324
Come on, erin.
Let's find the bathroom.

251
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:07,381
Well, i'll be damned.

252
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,742
Ma'am, we need
to report a suicide.

253
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,620
Something like this
comes along,

254
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,180
it makes folks realize

255
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,726
how crazy the world
is out there.

256
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:20,887
Right.

257
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,988
Would you mind calling
the sheriff, ma'am?

258
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,693
It's gonna cost you
10 cents.

259
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:36,042
You want some pig?

260
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,521
Big brothers.

261
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,561
I just feel
so disgusting.

262
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,771
Oh, there's about
6 of them altogether,

263
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:09,108
counting the dead one.
Poor thing. It's awful.

264
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:12,511
Well, why don't you
ask them yourself?

265
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:16,416
Right. Where did you say
you found her again?

266
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:18,181
Ma'am, i already
told you.

267
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,211
About 10 minutes
west of here.

268
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,317
About 5 miles west.

269
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,329
Ma'am, excuse me.

270
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:30,491
When is the sheriff
gonna be here?

271
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,033
Sheriff said
he's headed over

272
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:34,092
to the old
crawford mill.

273
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:36,330
I'm sorry.
The what?

274
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,237
The old crawford mill.
He wants to know

275
00:16:38,274 --> 00:16:40,242
if you wouldn't mind
driving over there

276
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:42,244
to make your report.

277
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:43,404
Yes.

278
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,037
Yes, we
goddamn mind.

279
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,739
I'm sorry,
but how often

280
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,751
do girls just blow
their heads off

281
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:51,685
in this shit-hole town?

282
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,415
All right,
just calm down, ok?

283
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,253
Let me... i'm sorry.
I apologize.

284
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,792
But, ma'am,
i don't understand.

285
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,293
Why the hell
won't the sheriff

286
00:16:58,328 --> 00:16:59,795
just come out here?

287
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,729
Didn't say.
He said it would be

288
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,756
about 2 hours
before he could get here.

289
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,664
We're not gonna drive
around this town

290
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:08,637
with a dead girl
in the back of our van!

291
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,168
Young man...

292
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,578
what you do
is your own business.

293
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,729
Come on.

294
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:36,892
Get in.

295
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,237
I just want
to go home, ok?

296
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:44,263
That's fine.

297
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:27,079
It's starting
to stink back here.

298
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:29,382
No worse than the inside
of that fucking store.

299
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,581
Did you smell
that nasty beef shit?

300
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,291
Oh, my god.

301
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,129
Guys.

302
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,655
Hello!

303
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:13,152
Hello?

304
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:26,938
Ain't no
sheriff here.

305
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:28,467
I think we should
drop off the body

306
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,036
and get the hell
out of here.

307
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:34,642
Maybe we should
vote on it.

308
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:36,677
Kemper, no.

309
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:41,283
Why not, erin?
It is a democracy.

310
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,816
Well, how would
you like it

311
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:45,022
if we just dumped
your body out here?

312
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,121
I'm sorry.
Nobody asked her

313
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,187
to blow her head off
in our van.

314
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:48,289
My van.

315
00:19:54,272 --> 00:19:56,297
I say we dump her.

316
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:58,741
Pig.

317
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,904
Cool. All right. Fine.

318
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:02,777
2 votes.

319
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:06,580
Now we just need
one more. Kemper?

320
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:09,587
One more and we're
out of here.

321
00:20:09,621 --> 00:20:11,316
Kemper, please?

322
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,625
Baby, she's dead.

323
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:24,297
I just...
i really don't think

324
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:26,236
it matters
where we leave her.

325
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,297
Well, it matters to me...
if that means anything.

326
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,899
Erin, look...

327
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:32,375
that girl has got parents
out there somewhere

328
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,775
who's gonna want her back,

329
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,404
not just dumped
on the side of the road

330
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:38,075
like a piece of trash.

331
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:48,048
You see our lone ranger
anywhere?

332
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:53,859
Maybe this
isn't the crawford mill.

333
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:59,064
It's unbelievable.

334
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,867
This is a joke.

335
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,238
There's nobody here.

336
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:05,276
There's no sheriff here.

337
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:09,672
What?

338
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,080
I just saw something
move in there.

339
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,414
I just saw something.

340
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:13,748
I swear to god,

341
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,083
i just saw something
move in there.

342
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:16,748
You're just trying
to scare me into leaving.

343
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,086
Erin, come on.

344
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:19,421
Go to hell.

345
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,720
Erin, come on.
Quit screwing around.

346
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,514
Aah! Kemper!

347
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,614
Erin!

348
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,818
Erin!

349
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:56,259
Erin, where are you?

350
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,239
All right.

351
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,263
Go.

352
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:16,249
I got it.

353
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:17,773
Ok.

354
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:30,189
Damn it!
Give me...

355
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,322
give me something
to hold this.

356
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,927
It's a possum,
indigenous to the...

357
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,340
i didn't do that.

358
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:48,837
All right.

359
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,318
All right, that's it!
If somebody's out there,

360
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:54,820
just stop fucking around,
all right?

361
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,050
I mean it!
Just come on out!

362
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,137
Who are you?

363
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:17,335
What did you do to her?

364
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:19,811
Huh?

365
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:23,646
The girl out there,
in the van.

366
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:26,152
We didn't do
anything to her.

367
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,654
She did that
to herself.

368
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,788
Oh, my god.

369
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,305
Promise
you won't hurt me?

370
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,176
Hey, you make these?

371
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:07,694
Hey, bud. Hey.

372
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:11,221
This is the old
crawford mill, right?

373
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,695
My name is erin.

374
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:19,604
Jedidiah.

375
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:26,177
Hey, junior.

376
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,478
So, we're waiting here
for the sheriff.

377
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:30,108
Do you know
where he is?

378
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:33,079
Ok. Well... where?

379
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:37,382
Home...
getting drunk.

380
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,359
So, cool.
Um, let's split.

381
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:41,258
If the sheriff
doesn't give a shit,

382
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,024
then why should we?

383
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:45,827
Does he live
around here?

384
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,259
You know,
front-row tickets

385
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:51,305
to a big concert.

386
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,432
Can we drive
there from here?

387
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,670
Road don't go there.

388
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:57,178
Short walk, though.

389
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,804
I think
we should go,

390
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:01,179
like now,
like right now.

391
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,143
How do i get
to the sheriff's?

392
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:42,257
Whoa! Hey, you sick
little mutant.

393
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,618
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on now. Let go.

394
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:49,130
Get out of here.

395
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:50,790
That's
police evidence.

396
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:29,169
Is anybody home?

397
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:31,400
Hello!

398
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:32,931
What do you want?

399
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,738
Um... are you
the sheriff?

400
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:37,245
Do i look
like a sheriff?

401
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,441
I don't know.
I can't see you.

402
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:41,279
Stand back
from the door.

403
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:53,558
Sheriff don't live here.

404
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,689
You can call him
if you want to.

405
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:58,758
Thanks. We'd really
appreciate it.

406
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,838
Wipe your feet.

407
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:05,171
I like to keep
a clean house.

408
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:11,171
I said
she could call him.

409
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,307
You wait outside.

410
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:14,543
Ok, chief.

411
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,415
I ain't looking
for trouble.

412
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:17,680
Don't shoot.

413
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:24,920
There.

414
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,679
I'll dial him
for you.

415
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:07,670
Hello?

416
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:09,764
Hi. Is... is this
the sheriff's office?

417
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,934
Can i speak
to him, please?

418
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:29,157
Oh, thank god.

419
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:55,752
Now, it's just
an educated guess,

420
00:28:55,787 --> 00:28:58,255
but my money says
your dead body

421
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:00,917
is right there
in that van.

422
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:07,654
30 minutes? Believe me,
we will be there.

423
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,569
Thanks. I'm all set.

424
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:16,765
Wait. Wait.

425
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:19,708
Can you help me out
back here?

426
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,192
Are you ok?

427
00:29:35,226 --> 00:29:37,524
Could you just...

428
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:38,859
ok.

429
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,473
Excuse me.

430
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:52,771
Erin?

431
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,940
Excuse me.

432
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,782
Erin?

433
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:17,763
Excuse me.
You mind getting

434
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,805
the fuck out
of my way, son?

435
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:24,275
We picked her up

436
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:27,312
on the side
of the road, like...

437
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:30,838
wow. Look at that mess.

438
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,624
Who's this belong to?

439
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:46,688
She had that
on her, sir.

440
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:49,234
You don't say.

441
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:50,770
Had it on her?

442
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,364
Yes, sir.

443
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:03,312
Ok, if you could
just relax,

444
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,283
because you're
not helping.

445
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:14,388
Good girl,
good girl.

446
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,301
Pig sty.

447
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:40,884
Oh, jesus.

448
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,025
What the hell
was that?

449
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,793
Kemper?

450
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:32,964
Kemp?

451
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:45,507
Ha. Well, let's get her
wrapped up.

452
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,261
Oh, preffy
little thing.

453
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,027
How about giving me
a hand here, asshole?

454
00:32:59,066 --> 00:33:03,196
You don't expect me
to do this by myself?

455
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:05,739
I need some help.

456
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,244
Why do i always get
yanked into this shit?

457
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:11,870
What am i doing?

458
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,072
Lift her up
and just kind of

459
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:14,775
pull her over
your way there.

460
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:16,282
She ain't
gonna bite you.

461
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:17,875
She's deader than
a goddamn doornail.

462
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,749
Get ahold of her
and pick her up.

463
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:21,277
Yes, sir.

464
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:26,124
Oh, yeah.
There you go.

465
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,760
I bet she's
real unhappy,

466
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,265
real sorry that you're
getting fuckin' her blood

467
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,269
all over
your goddamn arm.

468
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:38,772
You know, back when
i was a young patrolman,

469
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,307
i used to love wrapping up
these young honies.

470
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:42,809
Yeah, i bet you did.

471
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,811
Yeah, cop me
a little bit of a feel

472
00:33:44,845 --> 00:33:46,779
every now and then,
you know.

473
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:51,808
Oh, look at that.
She's kind of wet down there.

474
00:33:51,852 --> 00:33:53,444
What you boys been doing

475
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:54,977
with this dead body anyway?

476
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:57,252
Can we please
finish this?

477
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,727
Kemper?

478
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:09,225
Kemp?

479
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:38,323
Something wrong?

480
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,096
Where is he?

481
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:41,625
I don't know.

482
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,661
But he's not
in my house.

483
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,707
Thanks.

484
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:55,976
Kemper?

485
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,447
Kemp?

486
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,654
Goddamn him.

487
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:11,632
Ok, boys, there you go.
There she is.

488
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,634
Let's get her
out of there now.

489
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:15,693
You, four-eyes, get a hold
of her legs there.

490
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:17,205
Get after
that part of it.

491
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:18,707
I got her head.

492
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:20,197
Oh...

493
00:35:20,275 --> 00:35:21,242
fuck.

494
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:23,176
Come on.

495
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,872
Ow! Shit.

496
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:27,973
Just stick her
in the back seat.

497
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:31,281
It just seems
so wrong.

498
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:34,755
Don't give me
any crap, young lady.

499
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,759
Goddamn it, i got
just as much respect

500
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:39,557
for a dead body
as anybody around here.

501
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:43,258
Hey! Get that nasty
goddamn thing

502
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:45,767
out of the back seat
of my goddamn car!

503
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:47,269
Put it in the trunk.

504
00:35:47,336 --> 00:35:48,803
What the hell's
the matter with you?

505
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,141
Put the legs.

506
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:53,438
Don't break
my stuff.

507
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:54,669
Put the legs in.

508
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,180
Y'all gonna be able

509
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,687
to find your way
out of here ok?

510
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:07,188
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll be fine.

511
00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:08,554
All right, then.

512
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:13,195
Protect and serve.
That's what we do.

513
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:15,720
That you did, sir.

514
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:24,228
Kemp!

515
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,078
Kemper!

516
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:26,733
Kemper!

517
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,207
Poor kemp. I mean,
he ain't ever

518
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:40,250
gonna get the stink
out of this van.

519
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:43,253
You think we should try
to clean it for him?

520
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,278
Be my guest.

521
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,855
You ok?

522
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,626
It's too much.
I'm gonna be sick.

523
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,760
Ok, good news.
Sheriff's on his way.

524
00:37:58,802 --> 00:38:00,793
The sheriff already came.

525
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:04,399
He took the body.

526
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:06,635
Where's kemper?

527
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,473
Isn't he with you?

528
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:14,685
Kemper?

529
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,619
What the hell is that?

530
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:22,384
Kemper!

531
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:25,718
Kemp!

532
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,404
There's nobody
even here.

533
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:45,783
Kemp!

534
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,409
What was that
all about?

535
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:50,853
Kemper!

536
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:54,324
What is that?
Oh...

537
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,384
it's somebody's
fucking teeth, isn't it?

538
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:58,327
Pepper, look, just
calm down, all right?

539
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,661
Erin, find your goddamn
boyfriend. It's time to go.

540
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,161
Kemper!

541
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,932
Kemp!

542
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:19,846
Morgan, what
are you doing?

543
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,984
Help him! Help him!

544
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:29,653
Oh, my god!

545
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:31,093
Pull him! Pull him!

546
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:32,528
I can't!

547
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,031
Oh, my god.

548
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:35,192
Ha ha ha!

549
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:36,201
You stupid...

550
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:37,725
that's not funny.

551
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,840
Oh, what the hell
is that?

552
00:39:48,547 --> 00:39:51,607
Is that the girl
from our van?

553
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,140
That's her.

554
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:58,450
Is that her family?

555
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:04,493
What were
they all doing here?

556
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,499
They were probably
looking for the sheriff.

557
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,234
It's fucking weird.

558
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:12,328
All right, you know what?

559
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,838
Let's find
kemper

560
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,567
and get the hell
out of here.

561
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:20,303
Where you going?

562
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,609
To find him.

563
00:40:22,648 --> 00:40:25,742
Well, where are
the keys for the van?

564
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,679
Well, who put you
in charge?

565
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,156
If you guys just want
to take off, that's fine,

566
00:40:35,194 --> 00:40:36,661
but i am not
getting in that van

567
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,162
and leaving
without him.

568
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:39,323
Give me the keys.

569
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:41,765
Don't even
think about it.

570
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,859
Andy...

571
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,836
i don't know about
you guys, but i happen

572
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:47,668
to like my teeth
right where they are.

573
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,264
I can't leave him.

574
00:40:49,308 --> 00:40:51,276
Let's go.

575
00:40:51,344 --> 00:40:53,244
We'll meet you
back at the van.

576
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:36,751
I know
kemp's in there.

577
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,155
Wonderful.

578
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,853
All right,
keep him busy.

579
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:50,829
Hi. It's me again.

580
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,838
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

581
00:41:52,872 --> 00:41:55,375
but i can't find
my boyfriend kemper anywhere,

582
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:57,377
and i thought
i would just...

583
00:41:57,377 --> 00:41:59,504
ain't you supposed
to meet the sheriff?

584
00:42:12,793 --> 00:42:14,283
Kemper?

585
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,791
Kemp, don't mess around.

586
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:28,239
Um... wow. What... what
a wonderful garden you have.

587
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:32,871
It's just so...
plentiful. Ha ha.

588
00:43:22,796 --> 00:43:24,286
Oh!

589
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,500
Damn it!

590
00:43:34,843 --> 00:43:36,902
Andy!

591
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:39,915
Hey, you can't
just go in my house!

592
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:41,348
Andy!

593
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:46,312
Are you ok?

594
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:48,049
Yeah.

595
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:55,728
What the hell are you doing
in my house?

596
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:58,264
All right, look.
We're just looking

597
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,699
for our friend,
all right?

598
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:00,996
Then we'll be
out of here.

599
00:44:01,036 --> 00:44:03,095
You ain't
running things, boy...

600
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:04,696
exceptin' your mouth.

601
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:06,832
This guy's crazy.

602
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:09,207
You little turd,

603
00:44:09,244 --> 00:44:12,008
you're so dead,
you don't even know it.

604
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,409
Come on, boy.

605
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:19,010
Bring it!

606
00:44:19,087 --> 00:44:20,418
Bring it.

607
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:21,820
Bring what?

608
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:22,823
Bring it.

609
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:34,529
Shit!

610
00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:39,373
Come on!

611
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:41,432
Andy!

612
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:52,383
Get the fuck
out of here! Run!

613
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,691
Shit! God!

614
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:57,910
Please!

615
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,887
Please! Stop! No!

616
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:02,720
Please! Put me...

617
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:06,518
shit!

618
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:09,156
Erin! Erin!

619
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:11,860
Erin!

620
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,301
Ugh! Kemper really
owes us for this.

621
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,545
What the fuck's
wrong, erin?

622
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:26,877
Erin, are you ok?

623
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,783
Where's the gun?
Come on!

624
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,082
Erin, what's
going on?

625
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,782
Where's the gun?

626
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,916
The sheriff
took it.

627
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:37,084
Shit!

628
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,254
Erin, what the fuck's
going on? Calm down!

629
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,320
Fuck!

630
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:41,591
What?
What?

631
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,265
Oh, thank god.
Oh, thank god.

632
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,770
Take it easy.

633
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,772
Thank god. My friend...
my friend needs help!

634
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,774
My friend right now...
my friend's dying!

635
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,366
My friend's being hurt!

636
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,378
Take a couple
of deep breaths.

637
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,276
There's some guy...
just...

638
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,542
just quiet down.

639
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:01,749
Please.

640
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,685
Now, what's wrong
with your car?

641
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,688
There's nothing
wrong with my car.

642
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,019
Whoa.

643
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,525
It's my friend.
Please help him.

644
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:12,187
I don't know
where he is anymore.

645
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,493
Somebody want to
explain this?

646
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:18,023
Lt... that's not mine.

647
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,765
You kids
taking drugs?

648
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,136
No.
No.

649
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,164
It's not our van.

650
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,109
I smell bullshit.

651
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,220
Get out of the van!

652
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:37,721
Out!

653
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:46,590
On your faces,
all 3 of you!

654
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,565
Get on the ground!

655
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,639
Arizona...

656
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:05,165
colorado...

657
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,906
new york.

658
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,141
Please, you've
got to help us!

659
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:11,843
He's fucking
killing him!

660
00:49:11,884 --> 00:49:13,681
Now we're getting
someplace.

661
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:16,119
Who's killing who?

662
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:17,553
There's
some fucking guy

663
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:19,181
with a fucking
chainsaw!

664
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:22,193
Get your sweet little ass
back in the dirt

665
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:24,991
until i say otherwise.

666
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:30,228
You know what i think?

667
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:32,703
I think your boyfriend
shot that little girl

668
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:34,399
and then he ran off.

669
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:35,906
He did not!

670
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:37,636
Some fucking guy
with a...

671
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:41,672
stop! Stop!

672
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:43,215
We're all gonna die!

673
00:49:43,215 --> 00:49:45,206
You girls better get yourselves
under control,

674
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:47,218
or i'm gonna have to
do it for you.

675
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:49,243
Why won't you
listen to her?

676
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:52,223
Get on your feet.

677
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:54,691
Get over
by the van.

678
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:55,715
Please stop.

679
00:49:55,794 --> 00:49:59,161
We're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

680
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:02,928
I want to know exactly
what happened inside that van.

681
00:50:02,968 --> 00:50:05,664
We already told you
what happened.

682
00:50:05,704 --> 00:50:08,673
And now you're
gonna show me.

683
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,756
Is that where
she was sitting?

684
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:02,625
Because the angle
don't add up for me

685
00:51:02,662 --> 00:51:05,130
with the blood
on that back window.

686
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:17,572
Maybe she was
a bit more in the middle.

687
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,771
Well, maybe
you ought to move

688
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:22,212
a little more
over to the middle.

689
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:23,806
But...

690
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:29,620
what, are you afraid
of a little blood?

691
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:34,219
Get the fuck
over there!

692
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,695
I don't have much
of an imagination,

693
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:48,401
so i need to get
a distinct image

694
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,842
of what
went down here.

695
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:52,971
What did
she do next?

696
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,379
She...

697
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,886
she shot herself.

698
00:51:58,886 --> 00:52:00,979
Oh, she
shot herself.

699
00:52:02,423 --> 00:52:03,617
How?

700
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:06,319
What do you mean, how?

701
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,989
Take the gun.

702
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,759
Take the gun
and show me

703
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:14,825
how she did it.
Come on.

704
00:52:14,868 --> 00:52:18,736
Take the gun.
Take the gun

705
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:21,036
and show me.

706
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,908
Take the goddamn gun!

707
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,680
Is that
how she did it?

708
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:34,482
Yes. Yes, sir.

709
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,489
You're
a fucking liar.

710
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:37,990
There ain't no hole

711
00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:40,255
in the bottom of
her chin. I looked.

712
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,819
She stuck
the goddamn weapon

713
00:52:42,863 --> 00:52:44,490
into her mouth.

714
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,362
Didn't she?

715
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,899
Show me
how she did it.

716
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,635
Do it!
Please...

717
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:55,438
show me.

718
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,677
Please, please, please,
please, please...

719
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:02,205
that a boy.
There you go.

720
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:05,218
And then what
did she do?

721
00:53:05,286 --> 00:53:07,220
She shot herself.

722
00:53:07,255 --> 00:53:09,223
You ain't lying
to me again, are you?

723
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,258
Because i have never
seen a weapon go off

724
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:15,126
without somebody's finger
on the fucking trigger.

725
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:17,688
Morgan, what's going on?

727
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:21,329

728
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:26,363
You mother fucker!
Get on the fucking floor!

729
00:53:26,407 --> 00:53:28,102
I said get on the floor!

730
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:29,576
What the hell
are you doing?

731
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:32,102
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

732
00:53:32,147 --> 00:53:33,444
Morgan, please,

733
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,971
Just please put
the gun down, ok?

734
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,209
Please don't do it.

735
00:53:36,251 --> 00:53:37,479
Oh, my god. Morgan.

736
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:39,354
You lyin' fuck!

737
00:53:39,354 --> 00:53:40,844
You could kill me
right now,

738
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,754
get out of here
scot-free, couldn't you?

739
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,553
Morgan, please,
just put it down.

740
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:48,494
He shoots me,
you're accomplices to murder!

741
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:49,963
Morgan...

742
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:52,694
please. Please!
Come on!

743
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:55,430
Morgan! Damn!

744
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,199
Fucking shoot him!

745
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:59,433
Morgan,
put the gun down.

746
00:53:59,474 --> 00:54:01,169
Shoot him!
Don't fucking do it!

747
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:04,144
You don't have
the fucking balls, do you?

748
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:08,405
Pull the fucking trigger!

749
00:54:08,449 --> 00:54:10,508
Fuck you!

750
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,657
Well, well, well.
Looky here.

751
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:19,024
Oh, my god, morgan.

752
00:54:19,061 --> 00:54:21,256
We got ourselves
a killer,

753
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:22,992
only this time,

754
00:54:23,032 --> 00:54:24,966
you killed
a sheriff.

755
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:33,397
I ought to blow
your fucking brains

756
00:54:33,442 --> 00:54:35,205
out right now,
asshole.

757
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:37,007
Get out of the van.

758
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:38,741
Get out.

759
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:41,306
Get out of the van.

760
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:46,020
Morgan.

761
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:47,784
Where are you
taking him?

762
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:49,323
What are you doing?

763
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:51,826
Where are you taking him?
Jesus christ!

764
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,852
Get the fuck
away from me!

765
00:55:47,317 --> 00:55:49,114
Man, this is bullshit.

766
00:55:54,858 --> 00:55:56,758
I have rights.

767
00:55:57,994 --> 00:56:00,724
Yeah, you got
rights, ok.

768
00:56:00,764 --> 00:56:03,358
Where was
y'all headed?

769
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,867
Dallas...

770
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:08,234
for a skynyrd concert.

771
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:12,139
Skynyrd? Hell,
i like skynyrd.

772
00:56:12,175 --> 00:56:13,699
By god,
how about that?

773
00:56:13,743 --> 00:56:16,041
We got something
in common, don't we?

774
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,569
Ha ha ha.

775
00:56:17,614 --> 00:56:19,206
Well, what
are you gonna do

776
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:21,649
with your tickets
now, hot shot?

777
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,090
You can have them.

778
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:30,888
Is that bribery?

779
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:39,327
Oh, that was really
rude, wasn't it?

780
00:56:40,804 --> 00:56:43,705
Oh, look at you.

781
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,335
How about that?

782
00:56:50,314 --> 00:56:51,781
Look at that shit.

783
00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:54,944
We got something
else in common now.

784
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:57,852
Ha ha ha. See that?

785
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:07,690
Get on over to the damn
crawford mill.

786
00:57:07,732 --> 00:57:11,190
Those 2 fillies
are good to go.

787
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:20,210
Shit.

788
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:22,212
What do you think
he's doing to morgan?

789
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:25,409
I don't want to
think about it, ok?

790
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:32,751
Oh, shit!

791
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:34,723
Pepper, i need you

792
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,760
to hold that light
really steady.

793
00:57:36,794 --> 00:57:38,921
Can you do that?

794
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:51,472
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

795
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,343
In juvie. They call
my youth misspent.

796
00:57:55,379 --> 00:57:57,142
Oh, thank god.

797
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:17,258
Get out of the car.

798
00:58:17,302 --> 00:58:18,735
Where are we?

799
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,261
That's none of your
goddamn business, faggot!

800
00:58:21,306 --> 00:58:23,900
Just get out
of the goddamn car!

801
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,844
You kids shouldn't have
messed with that little girl.

802
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:41,052
You brought this all
on yourself.

803
00:58:41,126 --> 00:58:43,754
Now get the hell
in the house!

804
00:58:46,097 --> 00:58:47,428
Come on, please.

805
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:48,694
Come on.

806
00:58:51,536 --> 00:58:52,628
Come on.

807
00:58:52,671 --> 00:58:54,639
Come on, erin.
Come on!

808
00:58:54,673 --> 00:58:56,106
Yes!
Yes!

809
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,734
Go, go, go!

810
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,757
Aah! Go! Go!

811
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,624
Help, pepper! No!

812
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:06,467
Pepper!

813
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,750
Run!

814
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:20,855
No! No, pepper!

815
01:01:06,807 --> 01:01:09,275
Please! Please!
Please let me in!

816
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:12,278
Please! Help me, please!

817
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:14,803
Come on. Come on.

818
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:40,270
Why don't you
have a seat?

819
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:43,433
It's ok. Sit down.

820
01:01:43,477 --> 01:01:45,707
Have a seat.

821
01:01:45,746 --> 01:01:49,147
Turn that thing off!
He's gonna fucking hear us!

822
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:04,193
There's nothing a good old
cup of tea won't settle.

823
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:11,001
Nobody's gonna come
through that door.

824
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,701
I really need
to use your phone.

825
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:15,766
We don't have one.

826
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:21,438
Phones are a hassle.

827
01:02:21,482 --> 01:02:24,849
No! Don't you get it?

828
01:02:24,886 --> 01:02:27,480
He's gonna kill you.
He's gonna kill all of us.

829
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:30,082
Oh, no, he won't.

830
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:32,649
Yes, he will.

831
01:02:32,727 --> 01:02:37,721
He knows better than
to be messing around here.

832
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,257
Everyone around here
knows that...

833
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:43,429
poor sweet boy.

834
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:44,904
Sweet boy.

835
01:02:44,939 --> 01:02:46,839
He's no harm.

836
01:02:46,874 --> 01:02:49,843
He always keeps
to himself.

837
01:02:49,877 --> 01:02:53,836
Skin disease.

838
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:57,908
He was just a little boy
when it started.

839
01:02:57,952 --> 01:03:00,386
Didn't you look
at his face?

840
01:03:02,323 --> 01:03:04,621
I couldn't.
I couldn't look at him.

841
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:07,957
Oh, sweetie. Here.

842
01:03:09,797 --> 01:03:12,527
Here. It's just...
just right.

843
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:16,264
Come drink some
before it gets cold.

844
01:03:16,304 --> 01:03:18,204
You have no idea.

845
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:23,010
Hush now.

846
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:25,103
I don't want to drink
any more tea!

847
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:26,443
I just need a phone!

848
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:29,450
Now you see
what you've done?

849
01:03:31,386 --> 01:03:33,286
Oh. Ha ha...

850
01:03:33,322 --> 01:03:35,381
that wasn't
a good idea.

851
01:03:42,564 --> 01:03:44,691
Now, drink up your tea.

852
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:47,031
It'll help you relax.

853
01:03:47,069 --> 01:03:49,867
I'll be right back.

854
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:56,835
You're
a little tense.

855
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:59,109
You should relax.

856
01:04:43,158 --> 01:04:45,922
I got to go.

857
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,791
You ok, child?

858
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:52,130
You don't look
so good.

859
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,465
I thought you said
you didn't have a phone.

860
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:00,965
It's ok.
It's all right.

861
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:07,345
That's not your baby.

862
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:11,546
You stole her!

863
01:05:13,756 --> 01:05:17,123
She's mine.

864
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:40,877
Oh, my. Oh, my,
my, my, my, my.

865
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:44,648
Everything's gonna be fine
real soon.

866
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:47,485
I promise.

867
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:04,667
Give her some room.

868
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:08,507
Maybe she'd like to
stay for supper.

869
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:10,273
Messed up
everything already.

870
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:11,781
Stop bothering her.

871
01:06:11,815 --> 01:06:13,783
Grandma!
Let me in now!

872
01:06:13,817 --> 01:06:16,411
You best stay out there
with them dogs

873
01:06:16,453 --> 01:06:19,889
till you learn
how to play by the rules.

874
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:23,985
You're not going
nowhere, honey.

875
01:06:25,829 --> 01:06:29,230
Please. Please
just let me go.

876
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,201
I know your kind...

877
01:06:32,236 --> 01:06:36,570
nothing but cruelty
and ridicule for my boy,

878
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:39,974
all the time
he was growing up.

879
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:46,215
Does anybody care
about me and my boy?

880
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:49,645
Huh?

881
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:51,211
Don't hurt her!
Please, grandma.

882
01:06:51,255 --> 01:06:53,018
You shut up
out there!

883
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:56,288
Help me! Please!
Make them stop!

884
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,521
Looky, mama.
She likes me.

885
01:07:00,164 --> 01:07:03,156
What's wrong with
you fucking people?

886
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,701
Nothing
wrong with us.

887
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:07,236
Tommy.

888
01:07:07,304 --> 01:07:08,771
Help me, please!

889
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:10,706
Thomas brown hewitt,

890
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:13,437

right now!

891
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:16,212
No! No!

892
01:07:16,246 --> 01:07:18,214
Get her out of my sight.

893
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:19,613
No! Please! No!

894
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:20,742
Please!

895
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,551
Will you cut out
that racket?

896
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,218
Here's
your pants.

897
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:31,751
Thank you.

898
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:36,761
No!

899
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:17,708
Oh, my god.

900
01:08:57,249 --> 01:09:01,151
Uh... erin...

901
01:09:01,187 --> 01:09:02,381

902
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:03,945
erin, help.

903
01:09:03,989 --> 01:09:05,081
Ok.

904
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:11,493
Lift your body.
Lift your body up.

905
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,792
Stop!

906
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:14,025
Push!

907
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:20,299
Stop!

01:26:07,992 --> 01:26:09,254
Stop!

990
01:26:21,105 --> 01:26:23,733
Hey there.
You all right?

991
01:26:23,774 --> 01:26:27,266
Huh? Are you ok?

You in a car wreck?

Where are we going?

996
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:55,833
I'm going to
get you some help.

997
01:26:55,873 --> 01:26:57,363
Honey,

998
01:27:01,812 --> 01:27:03,177
Huh?

999
01:27:03,214 --> 01:27:07,048
I just want

1000
01:27:07,084 --> 01:27:10,520
You live

1001
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:11,886

01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:17,583

I don't know what
your problem is,

1012
01:27:46,325 --> 01:27:47,849
but i can't
take this.

1013
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:49,417
Don't get out.

1014
01:27:49,461 --> 01:27:51,224
Don't get out!

1015
01:28:15,687 --> 01:28:17,712
Hello in there!
Hello! Help! Ma'am.

1016
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:19,223
Ma'am, please help.

1017
01:28:19,258 --> 01:28:20,623
I need some help

1018
01:28:20,659 --> 01:28:21,956
What do you want?

1019
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:23,552
I picked up a girl.
She's bloody.

1020
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:25,722
She's out here
in my truck.

1021
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:29,131
Junior. Junior.

01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:41,369
I'm glad to see you.

1026
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,175
Henrietta.

1027
01:28:43,248 --> 01:28:44,738
I give her a ride.

1028
01:28:44,816 --> 01:28:46,875
I found her running
down the highway.

1029
01:28:46,953 --> 01:28:48,045
I don't know her name.

1030
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,789
She grabbed
the steering wheel

1031
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:54,292
and dang near
run me off the road.

1032
01:28:54,327 --> 01:28:56,295
She nearly caused us
to crash.

1033
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:58,126
Yes, she grabbed it
while i was driving.

1034
01:28:58,164 --> 01:29:00,394
She's hysterical.

1035
01:29:00,433 --> 01:29:03,163
She's out there
in the truck.

1036
01:29:03,202 --> 01:29:05,193
I've never seen
anything like it.

1037
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:19,411
The baby's gone!

1038
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:33,392
Come on. Come on.

1039
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:40,603
Come on.

1040
01:30:00,793 --> 01:30:02,226
Come on, you bitch, start!

1041
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:18,502
Fuck you!

1042
01:30:52,212 --> 01:30:53,770
You asshole!

1043
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,868
This is august 20, 1973.

1044
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:50,598
Our location is
the hewitt residence.

1045
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:53,368
We're gonna go and move
into the actual furnace room.

1046
01:31:53,408 --> 01:31:56,866
Watch yourself.
Look out.

1047
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:59,914
Oh, man. Ugh...

1048
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:03,247
iook out.
You got it?

1049
01:32:03,318 --> 01:32:07,254
All right. This is
the actual furnace room

1050
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:12,259
we're going into where they are
suspected to have perpetrated...

1051
01:32:12,327 --> 01:32:15,785
got a bit
of a jump there.

1052
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:17,297
Got it?

1053
01:32:17,332 --> 01:32:19,300
That's ok. Don't worry.

1054
01:32:19,334 --> 01:32:20,858
Come on back here.
Follow me.

1055
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:22,233
Come...

1056
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,606
the crime scene
was not properly secured

1057
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:35,945
by travis county police.

1058
01:32:35,984 --> 01:32:39,351
2 investigating officers
were fatally wounded that day.

1059
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:43,323
This is the only known image
of thomas hewitt,

1060
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,360
the man they call
leatherface.

1061
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:49,887
The case today
still remains open.
