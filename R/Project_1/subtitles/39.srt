Wait, hold on a second.

184
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,638

- C-Can you just stop?

185
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,268
- Yeah, okay, I'll stop.
- Just wait...

186
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,786
- You carry this shit.
- I'll--I'll...

187

- Wow!
- You know what?

188

I don't wanna go
anywhere with you.

189
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:48,570
I don't wanna go
to France with you.

190

I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

191
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,629
- Alright, fine.
- I'm just going back inside.

192
00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:52,923
I'll call you from Paris.

193

What is all the racket?

194

My house is on fire!

- Come here.

212
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,964

- Yes, Mom.

- Yeah.

- Hi, Mikaela.
- Hi.

217
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,158
- I have a bald spot.
- Oh.

218
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,629

- Become a waffle iron.

Just consider this the official start
of a remodel, okay?

225
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,400
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool...

226
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,616
- and a hot tub.
- Fine. Okay.

227
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,355

00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,123
I wanted to tell you
about this earlier.

236
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,729
It's just that--
You know,

237
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:27,518
Here's the thing.

238
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,976
Freshmen aren't allowed
to have cars.

239
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:32,758
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

240
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,157
Look, you're an Autobot.

241
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:35,843
You shouldn't be living
in my dad's garage.

242
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,423
I mean,
you're suffocating in here.

243
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,226
You deserve
better than this.

244
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,204
This is hard enough, man,

245
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,062
don't make it harder.
Can you just look at me, please?

246
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:46,666
Come on, big guy.

247
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:50,431
Look, the guardian thing is done, okay?
You did your job.

248
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,838
Look, I'm safe now.

249

Optimus Prime and the others.

to be normal, Bee.

That's why
I'm going to college.

I can't do that
with you.

253
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,231
It's not the last time
I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

254
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:06,420
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

255
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:10,119
But you'll always be
my first car.

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,024

- It's--I'm okay.

Well, look.

you can make it

264
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,623
You're like the best thing
that ever happened to me.

- And?

- Let's go, kiddo.

268
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,521
Nice timing, Dad.

269
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:46,830
I... adore you.

270
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:49,937
That's not the word that
I wanna hear really now.

271
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:50,587
What are you
talking about?

272
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:51,581
It's the same word
as the other word.

273
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,626
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I said the other word now,

274
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,033
you forced me to say
won't mean anything.

275
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:56,005
Plus, you haven't
said it either.

276
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,588
So don't get mad at me
for not saying it.

277
00:16:57,607 --> 00:16:58,278
Yeah,
but I haven't said it

278
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,074
because guys always run
when you say it first.

279
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:01,122
Yeah, well,
so do girls.

280
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:02,900
Especially,
girls like you with options.

281
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,978
So this is all part
of your elaborate plan

282
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,143

283
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:09,688
Can be.

00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:13,735

00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,724
<i>you</i> are agreeing
to share your intel with us,

346
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,032
but not your advancements
in weaponry.

347
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:58,685
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

348
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:02,543
It would absolutely
bring more harm than good.

349
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:05,623
But who are you
to judge what's best for us?

350
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,781
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side-by-side

351
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:09,311
in the field
for two years.

352
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:12,470
We've shared blood, sweat
and precious metal together.

353
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:15,522
Soldier, you're paid to shoot;
not talk.

354
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:16,807
Don't tell me.

355
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:17,998
And the, uh...

356
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,556
- The newest members of your team...
- Easy...

357
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:24,236
I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space.

358
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:26,253
An open invitation
to come to Earth,

359
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:27,948
<i>embedded by no one
at the White House.</i>

360
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:30,110
Let me stop you
right there, Mr. Galloway.

361
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:31,661
It was bedded
right here.

362
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:35,705
<i>And in my experience, the judgement
of both Major Lennox and his team,</i>

363
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,769
has always been
above reproach.

364
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,603
<i>Well be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

365
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:43,675
<i>that when our national security
is at stake,</i>

366
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,284
<i>no one
is above reproach.</i>

367
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,462
Now, what do
we know so far?

368
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,062
We know
that the enemy leader,

369
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:56,850
<i>classified NBE-1,
AKA Megatron,</i>

370
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,557
<i>is resting in peace</i>

371
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:00,591
<i>at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyss,</i>

372
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:02,798
<i>surrounded by
societs detection nets</i>

373
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:05,205
<i>and a full-time
submarine surveillance.</i>

374
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:06,299
We also know that

375
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:09,636
<i>the only remaining piece
of your alien All-Spark</i>

376
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,706
<i>is locked in
an electromagnetic vault,</i>

377
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:15,278
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

378
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,774
Decepticons,
we have located the shard.

379
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:21,206
<i>And since no one...</i>

380
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:25,447
can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

381
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:28,635
well, there--there's only
one clear conclusion:

382
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,876
You.
The Autobots.

383
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,799
They're here to hunt you.

384
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,754
What's there to hunt for
on Earth besides that?

385
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:40,400
"The Fallen...
shall rise again"?

386
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:42,215
Sounds to me like
something's coming.

387
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,960
So let me ask
if we ultimately conclude

388
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,842
that our national security
is best served

389
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:51,786
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

390
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,340
will you leave peacefully?

391
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,144
Freedom is your right.

392
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:01,350
If you make that request,
we will honor it.

393
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:07,821
But before your president decides,
please ask him this.

394
00:24:08,204 --> 00:24:12,804
What if we leave
and you're wrong?

395
00:24:20,351 --> 00:24:21,474
That's a good question.

396
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,550
Oh, my God,

397
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:28,884
just look at this place!

398
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:32,220
I feel smarter already.

399
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:34,404
Ron, can you smell it?

400
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,990
Yes, smells
like $40,000 a year.

401
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,198
Okay, cheapo.

402
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,577
Go ahead, we'll, uh...
We'll get your stuff.

403
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:42,949
Just go ahead
and check out your room.

- Hey.

00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,067
You must be Sam, right?
I'm Leo.

407
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:55,766
Hey.

408
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,924
Uh, sorry, I already set up the crib.
Do you want this side or that side?

409
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,534
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

410
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:08,188
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

411
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,864
Yeah, so you're trying to see
if I'm a normal guy.

412
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:11,982
I'm trying to see
if you're a normal guy,

- Especially girlfriends.

- You got a girlfriend?
- I do.

- Hmm.

Sweet.

- Server's almost online, Leo.

bad news in Shanghai.

Post it, baby. Go, go, go!
FTJ, FTJ!

- It's clean.
- What's FTJ?

437
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:59,587
- Fuel the Jet, Fuel the Jet.
- FTJ, FTJ.

438
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,880
- This is it. Did you see that?
- Wow. Okay, this half of Shanghai

439
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,346

when China says gas leak.

440
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:08,681
Don't believe the hype, bro.

441
00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:13,058
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

442
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,404
Yeah, I saw these robots
and they did this, like,

443
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:17,796
firing thing and they came down
and twisted this woman

444
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,153
- and she was like--
- Looks fake to me.

445
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:22,213
Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet's pure true.

446
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,262
- Neither does it lie.
- It looks fake.

447
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:26,336
No, man, I've seen them.
They are like these, uh, robots...

448
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,039
Look, look, look, it's fake.
Anybody can do on any computer, okay?

449
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:31,678
And I wasn't, uh... there.

450
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,585
So I can't comment
or speculate.

451
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,545
- Oh, no.
- "Comment and speculate"?

452
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,894
We're supposed
to go habitate?

453
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,902
No, listen, okay.
Don't be sucking the sack, bro.

454
00:26:39,942 --> 00:26:41,628
- Whose sack?
- Look, the ball sack.

455
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:44,868
- Dude, what kind of tool are you?
- Mainstream media sack.

456
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:46,251
They're lying to us,
alright.

457
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,402
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

458
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:49,593
Follow me.

459
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,261
Uh-oh. Uh, Leo.
Bad news, we just got scooped.

460
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:54,669

on GeoBoard.

By the way,
I read your file.

466
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,991
I'll pour, you'll pour...
We're gonna fix that, alright?

467
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,159
You work for me, now.

468
00:27:11,185 --> 00:27:12,638
I work for you now?

469
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,332
That's incredible.
It's first day of college,

470
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,396
I got a career,
a dinky internet firm,

471
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,482
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

472
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:21,520
You're mocking
my life's work, Samuel? Huh?

473
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:22,978
That's your one warning
patrolling, dude.

474
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,020
Don't make me that fast....
'cause I'll do it.

475
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:27,456
Hey alright, listen. It's getting
a little intense in my room.

476
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:29,581
- Can I switch now?
- Oh, sad face, 3-12.

477
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:32,450
No switching, no treating.
Let's turn that upside-down, okay?

478
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:34,214
- Oh, here we go.
- Hey, hi.

479
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:36,322
It's just like Hogwarts.
Hi!

480
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:38,150
Is this co-ed?
This is a co-ed dorm.

481
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:39,637
Do you guys want
to meet my roommates?

482
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:41,192
- Yeah.
- 'Cause they're real swell guys.

483
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,293
- Here is Leo.
- We're the Witwicky.

484
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,749
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.

485
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,647

You really do.

486
00:27:45,682 --> 00:27:47,136
Oh, well aren't you
the sweetest thing?

487
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:48,413
He's real sweet, Ma.

488
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:49,583
What is that in your hand,
by the way?

489
00:27:49,613 --> 00:27:52,315
Oh, I got this at the bake sale
for the environment

490
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,735
that those boys
were having.

491
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,216
You know, you don't often
see white boys

492
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:56,608
with the dreadlocks.

493
00:27:56,643 --> 00:27:58,815
- Mom.
- Yeah, it's a 100 percent pure Hawaiian

494
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,234
- green for the environment.
- Jud--Can you please drop it?

495
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,646
Yeah, then they baked it
with reefer in it.

496
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,065
- No, it's canna-- Hey!
- Please give me.

497
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,014
Hey! It's my cheap day.
I can eat whatever I want.

498
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,104
Please God, I'm gonna freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

499
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:10,006
- Please do something right now.
- Okay, okay.

500
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,545
Out of my way,
you wild hair!

501
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:13,460
I can eat all the freaking
brownies I want!

502
00:28:13,495 --> 00:28:14,124
Sorry, fellas.

503
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,910
I'm sorry and
you're welcome.

504
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,763
We call it the Hot Freshmen 55.

505
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:23,780
Sharsky hacked campus house and
stacked the dorm with pretty beddies.

506
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,570
Oh, my God.
It's her.

507
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,586
She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

508
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:34,503
She's tight for me on one
on my to-do list.

509

00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,892
The Cube
is merely a vessel.

680
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:43,637
It's power, it's knowledge
can never be destroyed.

681
00:41:43,638 --> 00:41:46,668
It can only transform.

682
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:50,019
- How is that possible?
- It has been absorbed

683
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,951
by the human child.

684
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:57,103
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

685
00:41:57,143 --> 00:42:00,837
Well then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body.

686
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:02,816
And you will,
my apprentice.

687
00:42:02,973 --> 00:42:07,825
In time. For millenia,
I have dreamed of my return

688
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,717
to that wretched planet,
where I too was once betrayed,

689
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:16,666
by the Primes
I call my brothers.

690
00:42:17,258 --> 00:42:24,191
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now only one remains.

691
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:27,892
Optimus.
He protects the boy.

692
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:31,319
Then the boy
will lead us to him

693
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,840
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

694
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:41,841
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

695
00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:47,100
Without more Energon,
hatchlings will keep dying.

696
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,183
Space, time, gravity.

697
00:43:00,754 --> 00:43:02,900
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

698
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:05,437
We're going
on a journey together,

699
00:43:05,477 --> 00:43:06,665
you and I, today.

700
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,530
All you, eager nubile young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

701
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:15,142
And I shall be your consort,
your guide,

702
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:19,584
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

703
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:23,918
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

704
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:29,331
For what do we know
about the stars?

705
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,397
Virgo... the virgin.

706
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,163
Orion, the great hunter.

707
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:38,347
These are no mere
twinkling diamonds

708
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,835
for lovely maidens
to wish upon.

709
00:43:40,856 --> 00:43:45,179
No, they are diamond,
filled with a throbbing,

710
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:47,994
savage and hemped-up energy.

711
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:50,666
Behold the work of
Albert Einstein,

712
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:53,377
a professor once,
like moi,

713
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,755
- energy, in its mass temp--
- What are you doing?

714
00:43:55,756 --> 00:43:56,756
Put your hand down,
put your hand down.

715
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:59,231
Young man,
there are no questions

716
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,320
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

717
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:02,661
I've just finished your book.
There's only one problem.

718
00:44:02,696 --> 00:44:03,694
Einstein's wrong.

719
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:07,270
Energy doesn't go
mass times velocity light square

720
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,576
in this dimension.
What about the other 17

721
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:10,038
while we're impossible
to give 17?

722
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:12,585
A clear example:

723
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:31,237
Come on, guys,
I can't be the only one in class--

724
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,897
Young man, I will not be punked
in front of the dean.

725
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:43,316
No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand?

726
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:47,414
I am the Alpha
and the Omega.

727
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:48,786
- Get out of my class.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:55,388
Any one else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

729
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:07,904
Hi, Bones.
Hi!

730
00:45:08,237 --> 00:45:10,790
Hi! Oh yes,
that's a good boy.

731
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,995
<i>Oh, what a good boy,
you are.</i>

732
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:18,920
Hey, Bones.

733
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:20,770
<i>You hungry?</i>

734
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:28,908
Here you go.

735
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:39,305
- Yes, Samuel.
- Hello? Mikaela.

736
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:42,167
I can't believe you're gonna
stand me up on our first web chat date.

737
00:45:42,202 --> 00:45:43,458
Something just happened
to me, okay?

738
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:45,459
- Wait, you finally hit puberty?
- <i>No, no, no,</i>

739
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:46,478
Stop laughing.
This is serious.

740
00:45:46,508 --> 00:45:47,387
Okay, remember
I was telling you about

741
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:49,405
my great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Witwicky?

742
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:50,237
Do you remember?

743
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:51,574
Watch where you're
supposed to go!

744
00:45:51,575 --> 00:45:53,962
Okay, remember
I was telling you about, okay...

745
00:45:53,997 --> 00:45:55,854
Can you stop...
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

746
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,899
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather
went to this Arctic mission, right?

747
00:45:58,934 --> 00:46:00,746
And he saw Megatron,
Megatron zapped him

748
00:46:00,776 --> 00:46:02,658
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols, okay.

749
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,108
Well, now I'm seeing them too.
Excuse me.

750
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:06,742
I just wrote a 903-page
Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

751
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:08,236
and had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

752
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:10,303
I am seeing symbols
ever since I--

753
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:14,484
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

754
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:16,578
Do you have it?

755
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,253
No, how about it's in
the shop safe? It's fine.

756
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:22,422
Mi--Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
Don't touch it.

757
00:46:22,462 --> 00:46:23,468
<i>I'm not gonna touch it,</i>

758
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:26,276
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away,
no one knows where it is.

759
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:27,820
But I do.

760
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,593
You're hot,
but you're ain't too bright.

761
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:35,322
There we go.

762
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,505
Oh, big son of a bitch!

763
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:45,203
What are you looking at,
Slobberpuss?

764
00:46:46,323 --> 00:46:47,536
Ah, what the--

765
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:50,239
This is a fricking
House of Horrors.

766
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,528
Hold on.

767
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:12,860
Is that the best
you got, huh?

768
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,207
Is that the best
you can do?

769
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:17,551
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

770
00:47:17,694 --> 00:47:20,520
Ow, that's my eye,
you crazy bitch!

771
00:47:20,594 --> 00:47:22,012
You gotta talk now?

772
00:47:22,787 --> 00:47:26,220
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube.
The Fallen demands me.

773
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:27,035
What knowledge?

774
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,041
You got the shot, I need the shot,
give me the shot, I need the shot.

775
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,919
Give me the shot,
they're gonna whack me,

776
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:31,237
I'm gonna be dead
without that shot.

777
00:47:31,704 --> 00:47:35,367
Easy Warrior Goddess,
I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

778
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:37,248
- Then I'm your worst nightmare.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

779
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,439
Hey, hey!

780
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:40,203
- <i>What the hell was that?</i>
- I'll tell you later,

781
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:41,770
just not on
open phone line, okay?

782
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:43,839
I'm gonna get on a plane right now.
I'll be there later this afternoon.

783
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:45,018
Just be careful, Sam.

784
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:56,040
And have any stranger giving you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

785
00:47:56,075 --> 00:47:57,501
Yeah, a large box!

786
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:59,239
- No.
- Good.

787
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:14,484
Major, incoming SOS
from Autobots.

788
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,257
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

789
00:48:18,514 --> 00:48:21,192
- Hansvin, how many?
- Unclear, sir.

790
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:23,075
Well, get clear.

791
00:48:27,717 --> 00:48:30,556
Autobots on the move.
Splitting them into two teams, sir.

792
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:33,231
Unarching their course, somewhere heading
to New York and Philadelphia.

793
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:36,829
Full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

<i>Flight Chairman

795
00:48:50,614 --> 00:48:54,629
M'amor (my lover), can I interest you
in Mayteam Zookeeper's Special?

796
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:57,043
Extra large supertees
with every known animal as a topping.

797
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:59,071
Basic lengths.
Only 18 inches of meat.

798
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:01,216
Oh, so you're a vegetarian.
Alright, it's cool. I am too.

799
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,848
Is Sam home?

800
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:06,131
Sam... I think he died but,
why don't we check?

801
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,078
- Here we are.
- Hey.

802
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:09,781
Have you had
a song stuck in yours?

803
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:11,185
It's like the worst song ever,
but you can't help

804
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,793
whistle it or sing it.
It's like, repeats itself,

805
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:14,985
repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself,

806
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:17,011
repeats itself...
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:18,068

- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- What the F?

809
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:21,420
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out, don't freak out.

810
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:24,332
Easy fix. Puzzle, code, in my head.
Now it's on the walls.

811
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:25,106
Everything is good.

812
00:49:25,141 --> 00:49:26,029
This is the part that--

813
00:49:30,894 --> 00:49:31,958
Okay,
what were you saying?

814
00:49:32,194 --> 00:49:35,387
Alice, I'm horrified you had
to see this. Let's go.

815
00:49:35,657 --> 00:49:36,949
- Get out.
- What?

816
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,077
Wait, wait, wait.
C-Can I just sit and watch?

817
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,641
I-I'll eat my pizza quietly.

818
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:44,196
Sam, I knew there were
something special about you.

819
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:44,843
Really?

820
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:48,878
And I know you know
what happens

821
00:49:49,142 --> 00:49:51,188
when two people
in the room get together...

822
00:49:52,274 --> 00:49:55,963
they're genuinely amazing...
in bed.

823
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:58,701
- Thank you.
- No problem.

824
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,543
Alright, listen, hold on.
Boundaries. Flight on the plane.

825
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:03,884
Okay, I'm very ticklish.

826
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:06,507
- You have the need, Sam. Relax!
- Why?

827
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:07,867
Oh, jeez!

828
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:12,060
Uh, what about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

829
00:50:15,034 --> 00:50:18,276
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

830
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:19,720
You want
some jerky meatloaf?

831
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:26,465

I can explain every--

838
00:51:21,418 --> 00:51:21,905
What--

839
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,005
- It's coming!
- This is an alien robot.

840
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,619
- You gotta move. Just run.
- They're real?

841
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:34,066
Oh my God, I can't believe
I once had sex with her in my dream.

842
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:35,707
I can tell that you really
missed me a lot, Sam.

843
00:51:35,737 --> 00:51:36,791
Look, it's not my fault, okay?

844
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:38,955
Listen, listen.
I'm a victim.

845
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:40,297
Oh, you were a victim?
Of what?

846
00:51:40,332 --> 00:51:42,409
- Of what? A little 80-pound girl--
- Of--Of...

847
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,174
It's like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox.

848
00:51:44,189 --> 00:51:45,567
You didn't have to put
your tongue in her mouth.

849
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,570
- I didn't.
- You did.

850
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,018
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged
by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

851
00:51:49,053 --> 00:51:50,690
It's not fun for me,
okay, Mikaela.

852
00:51:50,725 --> 00:51:54,366
And it smelled like--like diesel.
Like a diesel he dinged to it.

853
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:55,853
You're such a little girl.

854
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:57,932
You have ten seconds
of silence, right now.

855
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:59,205
I'm not talking to you
for ten seconds.

856
00:51:59,235 --> 00:52:00,997
No, you can't give me the silence.
You know what?

857
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:03,626
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds.
You have three seconds left.

858
00:52:03,661 --> 00:52:05,016
You know, what?
You can give me the silence you want,

859
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:06,749
all you want but you can't
give me the talking...

860
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:07,897
W-What were you gonna say?

861
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:09,394
I hope you had a lot of fun
because this--

862
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:10,627
This is over!

863
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,905
Did she finally led you
to orbits?

864
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:14,510
You threw a broom?
She did it, she went in it?

865
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:18,782
...gestating in that inside of you.
You're going right now, bro.

866
00:52:18,354 --> 00:52:20,413
You need to vomit right now.
Yak it, yak it.

867
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:22,501
- Right now!
- Who are you?

868
00:52:22,716 --> 00:52:24,832
I am the only one who
everybody can spit, okay?

869
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:25,685
I'm the key to this.

870
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:27,439
Aliens; they want me
because of my site.

871
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,372
Whoa!

872
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:39,586
Run!

873
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,146
Mikaela!

874
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,084
Watch out.
We get in.

875
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:06,208
It's a bomb!

876
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,363
We gotta get
that box.

877
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:21,883
This way.

878
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,074
<i>Hey, let me out,
let me out!</i>

879
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,007
Oh my God,
you know to hot-wire a car?

880
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,787
- That's so hot.
- Drive, drive, drive.

881
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:30,025
She went there,
she went there!

882
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:34,602
W-wait!

883
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:35,780
They can....

884
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:41,134
Cut, cut, cut.

885
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:49,084
Oh God!

886
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,351
Kiss this, bitch.

887
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,166
Drive, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive.

888
00:54:06,688 --> 00:54:08,122
Okay, so what else's
going right now, alright,

889
00:54:08,122 --> 00:54:09,650
did you guys just mess
with the minor details?

890
00:54:12,137 --> 00:54:14,279
Thing you saw back there.
That was a little babe.

891
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,187
Whoa!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

892
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,314
Sam!

893
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,004
- Sam!
- Hold on!

894
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:34,210
Hold on.

895
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,686
Sam!

896
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,120
I don't want to die!
We're going to die! Oh my God!

897
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,050
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, jeez!

898
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,397
Come here, boy.

899
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,007
Closer.

900
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:24,926
Okay.

901
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:28,560
- You remember me, don't you?
- I did what you said, okay?

902
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:31,260
- Just don't hurt us.
- Shut up!

903
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,064
Sam!

904
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,961
It feels good
to grab your first.

905
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:53,190
I am going to kill you,
slowly, painfully.

906
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:57,785
But first, we have
some delicate work to do.

907
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,599
I could snap your ribs off.

908
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,760
Doctor, examine
this alien specimen.

909
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,856
Sick of your face now.

910
00:56:32,992 --> 00:56:34,801
Go that way.

911
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,232
A wormy that's crabby--

912
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,525
- Oh, there they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

913
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,512
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

914
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,050
We must tear the brain!

915
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,372
Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?

916
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:13,491
Well, you have something
on your mind.

917
00:57:13,526 --> 00:57:15,869
- Something I need.
- Hold on. I know you're pissed.

918
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:16,566
I know you're pissed.

919
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:18,491
Because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

920
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:20,068
Somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset too.

921
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,593
I think that
we have an opportunity here

922
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:25,640
to start a new and--and
develop our relationship,

923
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,221
and--and,
see where it leads us, okay?

924
00:57:28,256 --> 00:57:29,461
So you just call
doctor inspection,

925
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:31,139
I'll let you talk
in five seconds.

926
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,099
W-Wait...

927
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,644
Go, go.

928
00:57:43,848 --> 00:57:44,788
Go, go, go.

929
00:58:11,715 --> 00:58:12,708
Sam!

930
00:58:29,622 --> 00:58:30,491
Go, go, go, go!

931
00:58:31,523 --> 00:58:32,564
Here he comes!

932
00:58:39,903 --> 00:58:42,975
Hide, Sam!
Hide.

933
00:58:51,682 --> 00:58:52,862
Weak.

934
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:56,208
Puny.

935
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:57,691
Voiced-up.

936
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:04,677
Junkyard drone.

937
00:59:05,663 --> 00:59:07,429
Decepticons!

938
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,802
Come here, boy.

939
00:59:48,703 --> 00:59:52,127
There is another source of Energon
hidden on this planet.

940
00:59:52,162 --> 00:59:54,236
The boy can lead us to it.

941
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:00,163
Optimus!

942
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:18,927
Is the future of our race
not worth a single human life?

943
01:00:18,928 --> 01:00:20,082
Op, get up!

944
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,533
You'll never stop at one.

945
01:00:23,843 --> 01:00:25,770
I'll take you all alive.

946
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:09,259
Sam, where are you?

947
01:01:13,478 --> 01:01:16,459
You are so weak.

948
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:45,017
At last, Prime is dead.

949
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:55,515
Sam, run.

950
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,683
Autobots, attack!

951
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:16,038
Bumblebee,
get them out of here.

952
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:30,996
This is Lennox.

953
01:02:43,863 --> 01:02:45,257
That went well.

954
01:02:45,977 --> 01:02:47,651
Lost the boy, Master.

955
01:02:47,691 --> 01:02:50,105
The Autobots must be shielding
the signals.

956
01:02:50,578 --> 01:02:52,882
- I can't even rely on you.
- Sorry. No.

957
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:55,077
What a simple insect!

958
01:02:56,334 --> 01:02:59,265
- What insect amongst severed billion--
- Shut up.

959
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,534
It could be anywhere.

960
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:06,714
Then we will force them
to find him for us.

961
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,987
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

962
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:13,506
No more disguises,
no mercy!

963
01:03:13,807 --> 01:03:17,421
Time has come
for my master's arrival.

964
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:24,767
Decepticons, mobilise.

965
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:26,770
It is time.

966
01:03:41,314 --> 01:03:43,848
<i>Oh, that single's good!</i>

967
01:03:44,049 --> 01:03:46,357
<i>Speaking French
is so exciting.</i>

968
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:48,211
Oh God,
who is this?

969
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:53,161
Hello-- I mean,
uh, bon--bonswa (good afternoon)!

970
01:03:54,326 --> 01:03:56,304
What?
Who is this?

971
01:03:57,672 --> 01:03:59,169
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

972
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:02,229
I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth breathing.

973
01:04:03,664 --> 01:04:05,522
New York City

974
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:43,538
Oh, jeez.

975
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:46,327
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

976
01:04:46,362 --> 01:04:47,499
Would you get out
of here?

977
01:04:47,732 --> 01:04:49,498
Might freak me out.

978
01:04:50,201 --> 01:04:51,423
We're gonna try
new things.

979
01:04:51,473 --> 01:04:53,042
Looks like Candian goosepoop.

980
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:56,590
It's nasty.

981
01:04:57,071 --> 01:05:00,052
US Fleet 2, North Atlantic

982
01:05:01,938 --> 01:05:03,322
That's fine, 1-2-5.

983
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:12,342
Revenge is mine.

01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:33,295

<i>As you've seen,</i>

995
01:07:21,845 --> 01:07:24,710
<i>we can destroy

<i>If you resist us,</i>

01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,949
- You gotta check this out.
- <i>Once they have a traffic camera</i>

1020
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:31,898
- <i>spotting a Sam Witwicky.</i>
- They have a picture of me, man.

1021
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:35,595
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we're wanted fugitives now.

1022
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:37,330
I just need you to focus
just one minute, man.

1023
01:08:37,365 --> 01:08:39,124
This thing is blowing
to a whole another level, alright.

1024
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:40,606
- You know one thing--
- Remove this thing.

1025
01:08:40,607 --> 01:08:41,690
They can track us.
Do you see this?

1026
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:42,429
What?

1027
01:08:44,857 --> 01:08:46,017
They can track us?

1028
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:47,767
Like satellite-track us?

1029
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,975
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
I'm not even with you guys.

1030
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:52,573
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping. Enough--

1031
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:53,864
Yo, Leo!

1032
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:56,291
This thing's gonna give me
a heart attack, I swear.

1033
01:08:56,326 --> 01:08:58,319
- That's 'cause you was a wuss.
- You did force me into the car, right?

1034
01:08:58,354 --> 01:08:59,684
- So...
- Oh, I think you scared.

1035
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:00,652
Hey, Mudflap.

1036
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:02,269
What are we going to do
with this shrimp taco?

1037
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:03,880
Just pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

1038
01:09:03,911 --> 01:09:05,204
and nobody gonna know nothing,
y'know I mean?

1039
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:07,211
- Wait, now my trunk--
- Yo, bumper cars,

1040
01:09:07,212 --> 01:09:08,880
Check it out.
I'm hearing you, okay?

1041
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,677
I'm right here
and I can hear you.

1042
01:09:10,707 --> 01:09:13,276
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

1043
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:14,736
I've had a hell of a day.

1044
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:18,150
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

1045
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:19,276
Go whine
to your boyfriend.

1046
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,977
Listen Sam, I know
what I'm gonna do, man.

1047
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:22,098
Look, I'm just going to go
to the authorities

1048
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,634
and tell them the truth.
Like I had nothing to do with this,

1049
01:09:23,653 --> 01:09:24,483
- I'm an accomplice.
- Hey, hey!

1050
01:09:24,518 --> 01:09:26,124
You wanted this, right?
You wanted the real deal?

1051
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:28,256
'Cause that's what this is.
Wake up! You're in the middle of it.

1052
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,252
You wanna run, go ahead,
no one's stopping you.

1053
01:09:31,556 --> 01:09:32,759
Stop complaining.

1054
01:10:09,364 --> 01:10:10,772
What is the meaning
of this?

1055
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,194
You dare
point your gun at me?

1056
01:10:13,195 --> 01:10:17,018
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

1057
01:10:18,844 --> 01:10:21,174
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

1058
01:10:21,209 --> 01:10:22,911
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- Tell them first.

1059
01:10:22,942 --> 01:10:25,046
- Tell them to lower the weapons!
- Major, there's nothing I can do.

1060
01:10:25,085 --> 01:10:25,860
Talk to him.

1061
01:10:26,161 --> 01:10:28,009
US teams deactivated, Major.

1062
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:31,145
You are decease
anti-Decepticon operations,

1063
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,543
and return to Diego Garcia.
Any further orders?

1064
01:10:33,573 --> 01:10:35,793
No. We take our orders
direct from Chairman Morshower.

1065
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,004
Well, I'll see your chairman
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1066
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:40,358
but I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1067
01:10:40,398 --> 01:10:42,026
I have operational command now.

1068
01:10:42,061 --> 01:10:44,390
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1069
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:46,108
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

1070
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,573
The secret is out.
This is our war now.

1071
01:10:49,769 --> 01:10:51,446
And we will win it
as we always have,

1072
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,716
with a coordinated
military strategy.

1073
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:56,388
This fool
is terribly misinformed.

1074
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,144
You're gonna get every assets
that you've got.

1075
01:10:58,179 --> 01:10:59,879
What we need is
to draw our battle plans.

1076
01:11:00,062 --> 01:11:02,251
What we explore every possible,
diplomatic solution.

1077
01:11:02,252 --> 01:11:03,663
Like what:
Handing over the kid?

1078
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:06,736
All options
are being considered.

1079
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,490
Whatever the Decepticons
are after,

1080
01:11:09,861 --> 01:11:11,308
this is just the start.

1081
01:11:11,429 --> 01:11:13,047
Wait, there is no negotiating
with them.

1082
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,718
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

1083
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,145
You won't be needing this
any more.

1084
01:11:16,527 --> 01:11:18,548
Get your assets
back to base.

1085
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:21,659
Take that scrap metal
back to Diego Garcia.

1086
01:11:23,519 --> 01:11:23,869
Let's go.

1087
01:11:25,594 --> 01:11:27,270
I really don't
like that dude.

1088
01:11:27,862 --> 01:11:29,722
He's a asshole.

1089
01:11:29,983 --> 01:11:32,395
<i>Autobots,
report to hangar for transport.</i>

1090
01:11:32,597 --> 01:11:35,220
Ironhide,
we should leave this planet.

1091
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:37,772
That's not what
Optimus would want.

1092
01:11:56,943 --> 01:11:58,660
There's nothing
that you could have done.

1093
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,546
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1094
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,520
Bee, if you hate me,
I understand.

1095
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:20,526
I messed up.

1096
01:12:21,893 --> 01:12:22,931
I'm sorry.

1097
01:12:24,537 --> 01:12:28,672
- Young fella, you are...
- ...person I care about most in my life.

1098
01:12:28,707 --> 01:12:31,505
- If there's anything you need...
- I won't be far away.

1099
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,150
He's dead
because of me.

1100
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,635
He came in
to protect me instead.

1101
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:40,654
There's some things
you just can't change.

1102
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,161
So this sacrifice was...

1103
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:44,889
will not have been in vain,
hallelujah!

1104
01:12:46,356 --> 01:12:48,178
We make it right
when we turn myself in.

1105
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:50,395
But we,
we've got to stick together.

1106
01:12:55,062 --> 01:12:56,778
You're not gonna do that.

1107
01:12:58,304 --> 01:12:59,038
Yes, I am.

1108
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,841
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

1109
01:13:05,842 --> 01:13:07,070
In one day.

1110
01:13:09,769 --> 01:13:11,204
- You two.
- Huh?

1111
01:13:11,896 --> 01:13:13,069
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1112
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,615
The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head.

1113
01:13:16,153 --> 01:13:18,202
That's old school, yo.

1114
01:13:18,203 --> 01:13:20,372
That's like--
That's Cybertonian.

1115
01:13:20,411 --> 01:13:21,974
Oh, that's some
serious stuff in there.

1116
01:13:21,975 --> 01:13:23,628
They gotta mean something,
like a message...

1117
01:13:23,663 --> 01:13:25,013
or, like a--
like a map!

1118
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:26,587
Like a map
to an Energon source.

1119
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,351
Can you read this?

1120
01:13:27,889 --> 01:13:29,183
- Read? Nah.
- You see that?

1121
01:13:30,092 --> 01:13:31,762
No, we--we don't really do
much reading.

1122
01:13:31,802 --> 01:13:33,053
- Not so much.
- Well if you can't read it,

1123
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:33,989
we gotta find
somebody who can.

1124
01:13:34,019 --> 01:13:36,070
Oh, look, who came
stashing and back.

1125
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:37,756
Hair grown like a chip,
there, look it.

1126
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,925
I had a bit of a mild
panic attack earlier, alright?

1127
01:13:39,955 --> 01:13:40,883
That's 'cause
you're a pussy.

1128
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:42,927
I think I'm allowed that
considering what I've been through

1129
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:44,482
and... I heard
you have a problem.

1130
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:46,130
I think I know someone
who can help.

1131
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:48,713
- Who?
- Robo-Warrior.

1132
01:13:49,585 --> 01:13:52,339
[SONG: New Divide
BAND: Linkin Park]

1133
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:53,743
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1134
01:13:53,783 --> 01:13:56,329
Everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

1135
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:57,728
One time
we hacked this site

1136
01:13:57,757 --> 01:14:02,393
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh...
alien drawings or whatever.

1137
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:15,348
This is it.

1138
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,692
Yep, deli. Good front.

1139
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:20,553
Alright, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1140
01:14:21,398 --> 01:14:26,845
Number 42, we got your kishkanishka
and crap-like combo right here.

1141
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,613
Cash only. Who's next?

1142
01:14:28,648 --> 01:14:32,015
I told you to cure the lock,
in the frying and then smoke it.

1143
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,595
Ma, you want me
to cut my handle off or what?

1144
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:36,644
- You order a terrible piece of fishing.
- I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1145
01:14:36,664 --> 01:14:37,725
Get out of here!

1146
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,177
Hey, Sam!
Watch your reach, huh?

1147
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:41,662
Take a number,
young man.

1148
01:14:42,256 --> 01:14:43,420
Robo-Warrior.

1149
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:46,123
Know him?

1150
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:47,586
I never heard of him.

1151
01:14:47,587 --> 01:14:49,893
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1152
01:14:49,894 --> 01:14:52,729
You must be talking about
that amateur blog operation

1153
01:14:52,764 --> 01:14:54,935
with GameBoy level security.

1154
01:14:54,936 --> 01:14:56,138
Robo-Warrior.

1155
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,958
It's him. It's him!
That's the guy right there.

1156
01:14:58,993 --> 01:14:59,921
That's him.

1157
01:15:00,985 --> 01:15:01,935
No.

1158
01:15:02,938 --> 01:15:03,971
You gotta be kidding me.

1159
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:06,469
Alright, meat store's closed.
Everybody out!

1160
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:07,600
Go, right now!

1161
01:15:09,353 --> 01:15:10,771
Wait a minute,
you know this guy?

1162
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:12,252
- We're old friends.
- Whoa, friend,

1163
01:15:12,287 --> 01:15:14,962
you are the case
that shut down Sector 7.

1164
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:16,500
Got the tie-bash
disbandment,

1165
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:19,846
no more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1166
01:15:19,881 --> 01:15:22,932
All 'cause of you,
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1167
01:15:22,961 --> 01:15:24,498
Look at her now,
so mature.

1168
01:15:24,499 --> 01:15:27,306
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1169
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:29,243
Don't catch me
with the thing.

1170
01:15:29,303 --> 01:15:30,620
- Yakov!
- What?

1171
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:32,878
You don't get Christmas bonus
just standing around.

1172
01:15:33,001 --> 01:15:34,846
You want those new teeth
you saw in SkyMall?

1173
01:15:35,084 --> 01:15:36,961
- It's my dream.
- Help around.

1174
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:39,642
- You live with your momma?
- No, my momma lives with me,

1175
01:15:39,672 --> 01:15:40,267
it's a big difference.

1176
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,228
They got your face
all over the news, alien boy.

1177
01:15:42,263 --> 01:15:44,383
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1178
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,705
How did that happen?

1179
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,971
Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding,

1180
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,283
but I don't want anything
to do with it

1181
01:15:49,323 --> 01:15:51,649
so, goodbye, you never saw me.
I got bagels to schmidt.

1182
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:53,349
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1183
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,835
Look, hold on,
I need your help.

1184
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,292
Really,
you need my help?

1185
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:58,152
I need--

1186
01:15:58,442 --> 01:16:00,737
Look, I am slowly
losing my mind, okay?

1187
01:16:00,831 --> 01:16:02,638
I had a little Crabbot,
placed the device

1188
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:04,190
deep into the soft tissues
of my brain,

1189
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:05,904
and started projecting
little alien symbols

1190
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:06,897
like a whole freaking movie

1191
01:16:06,932 --> 01:16:08,679
and on top of that,
I'm a wanted fugitive.

1192
01:16:08,714 --> 01:16:09,860
So you think
you got it rough?

1193
01:16:09,871 --> 01:16:12,040
You said it projected images
of your brain?

1194
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:12,865
Right.

1195
01:16:13,481 --> 01:16:14,795
Meat locker, now!

1196
01:16:15,411 --> 01:16:16,668
- Dead pigs.
- Yuck.

1197
01:16:16,682 --> 01:16:18,634
What you're about to see
is top secret.

1198
01:16:19,597 --> 01:16:21,506
Do not tell my mother.

1199
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:23,761
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1200
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:24,744
- Not good.
- Now you know.

1201
01:16:24,936 --> 01:16:26,672
Next time, you eat
a goat or a pig.

1202
01:16:26,673 --> 01:16:27,921
There's a story
behind this.

1203
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:29,269
Yeah,
there's a story.

1204
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,534
<i>...you're saying
you believe in aliens?</i>

1205
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:32,892
Okay, files, files.

1206
01:16:33,044 --> 01:16:34,673
We're talking about symbols.

1207
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,750
Hey! Still radioactive.
Hands off.

1208
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:40,306
Okay, Cube-brain.

1209
01:16:41,357 --> 01:16:43,405
Any of these look like
the symbols you saw?

1210
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:44,624
Where did you get these?

1211
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:46,638
Before I got fired.

1212
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:49,191
I coached S-7's
scrawny, drooly...

1213
01:16:49,226 --> 01:16:54,249
75 years of alien research
which points to one inescapable fact:

1214
01:16:54,284 --> 01:16:58,866
The Transformers;
they've been here a long, long time.

1215
01:16:58,901 --> 01:16:59,543
How do I know?

1216
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,902
Archaeologists found
these unexplained markings

1217
01:17:02,937 --> 01:17:05,368
and ancient runes
all over the world.

1218
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,722
China, Egypt, Greece.

1219
01:17:08,535 --> 01:17:09,980
Shot at 1932.

1220
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:11,986
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1221
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:14,462
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1222
01:17:15,175 --> 01:17:19,311
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same thing?

1223
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:21,885
Aliens.

1224
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:23,820
And I think
some of them stayed.

1225
01:17:23,855 --> 01:17:24,748
Check this out.

1226
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:26,823
Project Black Knife.

1227
01:17:27,154 --> 01:17:30,863
Robots, in disguise.
Hiding here.

1228
01:17:31,145 --> 01:17:31,837
All along.

1229
01:17:31,868 --> 01:17:34,956
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1230
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:38,638
I pleaded on my knees
with S-7 to investigate it

1231
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:42,240
but they said
the readings were infantesimal.

1232
01:17:42,275 --> 01:17:44,930
That I was obsessed!

1233
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:46,548
Me, can you imagine that?

1234
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:49,941
Megatron said that there was
another Energon source here.

1235
01:17:49,976 --> 01:17:51,743
- On Earth? On another source?
- On Earth.

1236
01:17:51,941 --> 01:17:52,982
Okay,
and that these symbols,

1237
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,576
the maps in my head
would lead him there.

1238
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:56,587
Should you talk
to your Autobot friends?

1239
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:57,817
No, no, no,
the source is before.

1240
01:17:57,857 --> 01:18:00,477
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them. It's before them.

1241
01:18:00,751 --> 01:18:02,247
- So it comes before that.
- Correct.

1242
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:04,172
Well then, report...

1243
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:06,222
Unless we can talk
to a Decepticon.

1244
01:18:06,734 --> 01:18:08,862
I mean, I'm not on
speed terms or whatever...

1245
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:10,360
Actually, I am.

1246
01:18:15,174 --> 01:18:15,958
Let me out!

1247
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,939
- It could be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1248
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:23,382
I'm gonna so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1249
01:18:23,521 --> 01:18:24,509
Behave.

1250
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:26,050
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1251
01:18:26,314 --> 01:18:28,194
- Can you train him?
- Tried to.

1252
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:31,590
I spent my whole adult life,
coming a plan of aliens.

1253
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:33,135
- You're very furious--
- And you're carrying it around

1254
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:34,912
what are you supposed to make
a little chihuahua.

1255
01:18:35,831 --> 01:18:37,949
Wanna throw it down,
you pubic fro-head?

1256
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:40,959
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye.

1257
01:18:41,411 --> 01:18:42,827
You know,
but if you're a good boy,

1258
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,841
then I'm not gonna torch
your other eye.

1259
01:18:44,876 --> 01:18:46,211
Okay?
I'm not gonna torch it.

1260
01:18:46,246 --> 01:18:48,216
Just tell me
what these symbols are.

1261
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:49,320
Please.

1262
01:18:50,901 --> 01:18:51,602
Okay.

1263
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:55,870
Oh, I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1264
01:18:57,234 --> 01:18:59,247
I don't read it, but uh,
these guys...

1265
01:18:59,723 --> 01:19:02,457
Where the frick did you find
photos of these guys?

1266
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:03,664
- Is this them?
- Yeah.

1267
01:19:03,704 --> 01:19:06,375
Sakers, pal.
Oldest of the old.

1268
01:19:06,484 --> 01:19:08,066
Oh, they've been here for
thousands of years,

1269
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:09,310
looking for something.

1270
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:11,161
I don't know what,
nobody tells me nothing.

1271
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:13,346
Oh, they'll translate
those symbols for ya.

1272
01:19:13,508 --> 01:19:15,006
And I know
where to find them.

1273
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:15,805
Show us.

1274
01:19:20,902 --> 01:19:22,724
Closest one's
in Washington.

1275
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:28,178
Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum.

1276
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:30,514
Land of dreams
in there.

1277
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:33,042
All I ever want to be
was an astronaut.

1278
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,465
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1279
01:19:37,748 --> 01:19:38,362
What?

1280
01:19:38,363 --> 01:19:39,862
I wear them
when I'm in the funk.

1281
01:19:41,017 --> 01:19:44,040
So does Jeamby, Cheater.
It's a baseball thing.

1282
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:47,093
Okay. Once you synchronize,
shop-mind and empty bladder

1283
01:19:47,128 --> 01:19:50,141
you get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1284
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:51,188
Here, take one
of these pills.

1285
01:19:51,229 --> 01:19:51,922
Slip it
under your tongue,

1286
01:19:51,957 --> 01:19:54,382
it's a high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1287
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:56,212
Fools the polygraph,
everytime.

1288
01:19:56,247 --> 01:19:58,185
Okay, now let's get this show
on the road.

1289
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:00,585
Whoa, no, listen.
I can't do this.

1290
01:20:00,615 --> 01:20:01,810
I'm not some
alien bounty hunter, alright?

1291
01:20:01,845 --> 01:20:03,168
'cause I'm not gonna do this.
Guards have guns,

1292
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,818
- I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1293
01:20:05,321 --> 01:20:07,962
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1294
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:11,187
Now look into my eyes,
and tighten up that spare tank.

1295
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:13,239
<i>The museum
is now closing.</i>

1296
01:20:13,631 --> 01:20:15,005
Papa, bad news, bro.

1297
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:17,010
Ran out of toilet paper,
you got any out here?

1298
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,202
- Please tell me you--
- Sir, I suggest you get in there.

1299
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:20,696
The museum is closed.

1300
01:20:20,731 --> 01:20:23,391
Listen man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1301
01:20:23,392 --> 01:20:25,219
Dumper-dumper.
I gotta go, alright?

1302
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,869
Sir, you are a grown naked man
around showing...

1303
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,817
- Pull your pants up and exit--
- I'm not going anywhere.

1304
01:20:35,714 --> 01:20:37,027
You got that paper,
right, sir?

1305
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:38,349
You should be embarassed.

1306
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,032
This a family museum, sir.

1307
01:20:58,648 --> 01:21:00,265
What is going on here?

1308
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,200
How many times
can you get tased in the nuts?

1309
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:04,741
So you covered the gates,
huh, you know.

1310
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:07,225
You're an amateur man,
a rank amateur.

1311
01:21:10,786 --> 01:21:12,701
There's now five guards.
Five guards.

1312
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,341
- You get this stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second.

1313
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:15,951
I gotta get
the tracker, alright.

1314
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:18,839
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1315
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,973
Look, look.
Follow him, follow him.

1316
01:21:38,008 --> 01:21:38,826
He knows
where he's going.

1317
01:21:44,702 --> 01:21:45,915
- He knows something.
- What?

1318
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,158
He knows something!

1319
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:54,623
- You got what I got?
- Yeah.

1320
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:55,733
Blackbird.

1321
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:00,576
There he is.

1322
01:22:00,611 --> 01:22:04,438
This guy's a legend,
like--like the Chairman of the Board.

1323
01:22:04,473 --> 01:22:06,198
Yo, freshman,
put the shard.

1324
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,777
And watch
the magic happen.

1325
01:22:15,824 --> 01:22:17,880
Oh shit,
it's a Decepticon!

1326
01:22:18,322 --> 01:22:19,955
- Decepticon?
- What is it?

1327
01:22:20,526 --> 01:22:21,905
Find the main tail!

1328
01:22:34,519 --> 01:22:37,319
What sort of hideous
mosalleem is this?

1329
01:22:38,891 --> 01:22:42,156
Semi pulls and days,
show yourselves!

1330
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,401
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1331
01:22:45,816 --> 01:22:48,563
W-wait, old spinal called
based organisms.

1332
01:22:49,733 --> 01:22:50,570
Bugger!

1333
01:22:51,645 --> 01:22:56,077
Behold the eternal glory
of Jetfire!

1334
01:22:56,112 --> 01:22:58,222
Prepare
for a systems' override.

1335
01:22:58,257 --> 01:22:59,734
I tell you, this guy
did not age well.

1336
01:22:59,769 --> 01:23:02,622
- He either heard it.
- Command these doors to open.

1337
01:23:02,904 --> 01:23:03,908
Fire!

1338
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,778
Oh, I said, fire!

1339
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:09,119
Bollocks.

1340
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,243
Break that,
these worthless--

1341
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:12,643
Wait a second.

1342
01:23:12,985 --> 01:23:16,505
Itching, wretching,
rust in my arse.

1343
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:19,820
Oh, the museum's gonna be
very angry.

1344
01:23:19,855 --> 01:23:22,167
Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane!

1345
01:23:25,953 --> 01:23:27,330
I'm on a mission.

1346
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:29,492
- W-wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1347
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:30,523
- Hey!
- What do you want?

1348
01:23:30,558 --> 01:23:31,666
Look,
we just want to talk!

1349
01:23:31,701 --> 01:23:33,347
I've no time to talk,
I'm on a mission!

1350
01:23:33,348 --> 01:23:35,166
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1351
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:37,245
- What planet am I on?
- Earth.

1352
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:39,294
Earth?
Terrible name for a planet,

1353
01:23:39,329 --> 01:23:41,286
might as well
call it "dirt".

1354
01:23:41,287 --> 01:23:43,229
Planet dirt.

1355
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:46,204
Tell me, is that robot civil war
still going on?

1356
01:23:46,767 --> 01:23:48,315
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1357
01:23:49,368 --> 01:23:51,537
Well, I changed sides
to the Autobots.

1358
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:52,983
What do you mean,
"changed sides"?

1359
01:23:53,018 --> 01:23:53,959
It's a choice.

1360
01:23:53,994 --> 01:23:58,344
It's intensely personal decision.
So much negativity.

1361
01:23:58,403 --> 01:24:00,451
Who wants to live a life
filled with hate?

1362
01:24:00,486 --> 01:24:01,559
Meaning you don't have
to work for those

1363
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,085
miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1364
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:06,489
If they set on their way,
they destroy the whole Universe.

1365
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,273
I'm changing sides,
I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1366
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:11,935
- Who's your little Autobot?
- Oh you cutes.

1367
01:24:11,968 --> 01:24:12,733
Name's Wheelie.

1368
01:24:13,355 --> 01:24:14,879
Say my name,
say my name!

1369
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,164
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1370
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,423
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1371
01:24:18,463 --> 01:24:21,072
Yeah, well, he's faithful,
and he's nude and he's perverted.

1372
01:24:22,878 --> 01:24:24,100
Can you just--
Can you stop?

1373
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:26,406
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ...I don't wanna argue it.

1374
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:27,113
What were you saying?

1375
01:24:27,976 --> 01:24:30,180
I told you
my name was Jetfire!

1376
01:24:31,967 --> 01:24:33,931
Wow, someone shit in the bed
this morning?

1377
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,704
Pretty stout
with my mother.

1378
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:40,345
My ancestors have been here
for centuries.

1379
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,191
My father, one was a wheel!
The first wheel!

1380
01:24:43,226 --> 01:24:45,237
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1381
01:24:45,491 --> 01:24:50,432
Nothing!
But he did so with honor, dignity and--

1382
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:00,885
My boosters are fried.

1383
01:25:02,461 --> 01:25:03,967
I thought
we could help each other.

1384
01:25:03,968 --> 01:25:06,456
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know.

1385
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:07,965
- I do.
- I don't think he knows anything.

1386
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,126
Honestly, I don't know.

1387
01:25:12,773 --> 01:25:13,702
These vivid symbols,

1388
01:25:13,744 --> 01:25:15,410
they're symbols
but they are in my mind.

1389
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:16,738
You see,
all this is in my mind.

1390
01:25:16,773 --> 01:25:18,742
And Megatron
wants what's in my mind.

1391
01:25:18,743 --> 01:25:20,032
Him and someone called
the Fallen.

1392
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:23,592
The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust.

1393
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:25,008
The original Decepticon.

1394
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:28,468
He's terrible to work for.
He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1395
01:25:29,285 --> 01:25:31,362
His suspects,
they were a part of my mission

1396
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:33,131
the Fall and Search,
I remember now.

1397
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:35,733
Of a dagger's tip
and the key!

1398
01:25:36,017 --> 01:25:37,856
Slow down.
The dagger's tip, the key,

1399
01:25:37,891 --> 01:25:39,295
- what are you talking about?
- No time to explain.

1400
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:40,862
Hold on, everybody!

1401
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:10,172
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1402
01:26:10,302 --> 01:26:12,044
I was overseeing
the wrong planet.

1403
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:14,006
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1404
01:26:15,652 --> 01:26:16,514
Oh, my God!

1405
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,131
Oh, God!

1406
01:26:28,946 --> 01:26:32,304
Oh, my God! You beautiful face,
this will be a perfect moment.

1407
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:34,357
Except you landed
on my testicles.

1408
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:36,194
Please get off!

1409
01:26:39,087 --> 01:26:40,045
My balls!

1410
01:26:41,003 --> 01:26:42,588
Sam!

1411
01:26:43,517 --> 01:26:46,789
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1412
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:47,925
Oh, my God.

1413
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,761
What is this?
It's Vegas!

1414
01:26:51,796 --> 01:26:53,451
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

1415
01:26:53,452 --> 01:26:56,352
Hey! I think
we're in Vegas!

1416
01:26:56,353 --> 01:26:57,848
That really, really hurts.

1417
01:26:57,889 --> 01:27:00,108
You're just lucky
that I didn't get hurt.

1418
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:02,694
People could've gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1419
01:27:02,695 --> 01:27:04,834
- you would have heard from--
- Oh, shut up!

1420
01:27:04,874 --> 01:27:06,646
I told you
I was opening the space bridge.

1421
01:27:06,676 --> 01:27:08,932
It's the fastest way
to travel to Egypt.

1422
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:11,426
What did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything!

1423
01:27:11,853 --> 01:27:13,982
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1424
01:27:13,983 --> 01:27:16,671
Don't you dare
slip in with me, fleshwing.

1425
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:19,579
- You would do the informed.
- Can you just stop for a second?

1426
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,537
Can you focus?
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1427
01:27:21,572 --> 01:27:24,236
so we can all have a little bit
assemblance and peace of mind?

1428
01:27:24,237 --> 01:27:27,505
This planet was visited
by our race once before

1429
01:27:27,506 --> 01:27:30,411
by our earliest ancestors
a millenium ago.

1430
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:33,441
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1431
01:27:33,476 --> 01:27:36,060
the life blood
of our race.

1432
01:27:36,095 --> 01:27:39,132
Without it, we'll all perish,
oxidize and rust,

1433
01:27:39,162 --> 01:27:41,098
let my wretched self.

1434
01:27:41,133 --> 01:27:45,218
Do you have any idea what is
like a slowly fall of parton die?

1435
01:27:45,364 --> 01:27:48,199
Let's not get episodic, okay?
Old-timer.

1436
01:27:48,651 --> 01:27:54,084
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1437
01:27:54,085 --> 01:27:59,056
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1438
01:27:59,228 --> 01:28:03,322
It harvests Energon
by destroying suns.

1439
01:28:03,432 --> 01:28:05,160
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1440
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:08,825
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes,

1441
01:28:08,865 --> 01:28:10,514
our original leaders.

1442
01:28:10,565 --> 01:28:14,523
And they set out in the Universe
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1443
01:28:15,112 --> 01:28:17,414
The Primes set out
with one rule:

1444
01:28:17,415 --> 01:28:20,556
Never destroy a planet
with life.

1445
01:28:20,557 --> 01:28:23,648
Until one of them
tried to defy this rule.

1446
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:27,889
And his name, for ever more,
was the Fallen.

1447
01:28:29,597 --> 01:28:31,933
He despised
the human race.

1448
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:37,133
And he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1449
01:28:37,168 --> 01:28:41,559
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1450
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,685
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1451
01:28:50,938 --> 01:28:55,420
A great battle took place
over possession of the Matrix.

1452
01:28:59,797 --> 01:29:02,382
The Fallen who was
stronger at his will did,

1453
01:29:03,536 --> 01:29:08,519
surrendered no choice,
but to steal and hide it from him.

1454
01:29:09,003 --> 01:29:13,818
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1455
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:17,142
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies.

1456
01:29:17,762 --> 01:29:20,750
A tomb
we cannot find.

1457
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:24,958
Somewhere,
buried in this desert,

1458
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:27,590
that deadly machine
remains.

1459
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:29,818
The Fallen knows
where it is.

1460
01:29:29,853 --> 01:29:35,686
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1461
01:29:35,967 --> 01:29:37,462
Okay so how do we stop it?

1462
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,640
Only a Prime
can defeat the Fallen.

1463
01:29:40,177 --> 01:29:41,242
Optimus Prime?

1464
01:29:44,077 --> 01:29:46,160
So you met a Prime?

1465
01:29:46,777 --> 01:29:49,315
You must have met
a great descendant.

1466
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,267
Is he alive?

1467
01:29:50,517 --> 01:29:52,823
Here?
On this planet?

1468
01:29:53,117 --> 01:29:55,381
He sacrificed himself
to save me.

1469
01:29:56,117 --> 01:29:57,364
So he's dead.

1470
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,400
Without a Prime,
it's impossible.

1471
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:01,807
No one else
could stop the Fallen.

1472
01:30:01,842 --> 01:30:04,998
So the same energy that's going
to be used to reactivate the machine...

1473
01:30:05,727 --> 01:30:08,693
Could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1474
01:30:08,728 --> 01:30:09,694
and bring him
back to life?

1475
01:30:09,729 --> 01:30:11,735
It was never designed
for that purpose,

1476
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:14,469
but it's an energy,
like no other.

1477
01:30:14,661 --> 01:30:18,593
So then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1478
01:30:18,628 --> 01:30:21,899
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols,

1479
01:30:21,934 --> 01:30:24,541
what you got in the sand,
it's your bloom.

1480
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:26,795
When dawn alights
the Dagger's tip,

1481
01:30:26,835 --> 01:30:29,623
three kings will reveal
the doorway.

1482
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:31,772
Find the doorway!

1483
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:33,304
Go now, go!

1484
01:30:33,557 --> 01:30:36,523
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1485
01:30:36,558 --> 01:30:39,062
Go before
the Decepticons find me

1486
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,065
and find you.

1487
01:30:47,378 --> 01:30:49,043
That was
my CIA contact.

1488
01:30:49,078 --> 01:30:51,494
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba

1489
01:30:51,544 --> 01:30:53,743
- the Dagger's Tip.
- That's the dagger's tip.

1490
01:30:53,778 --> 01:30:54,921
- It's part of the Red Sea.
- Got it.

1491
01:30:54,956 --> 01:30:57,159
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1492
01:30:57,194 --> 01:30:59,845
29 and a half degrees north.
35 east.

1493
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,063
There it is.

1494
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,472
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1495
01:31:03,507 --> 01:31:05,101
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1496
01:31:05,912 --> 01:31:06,802
We're gonna make a call.

1497
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:11,040
We got the cops.

1498
01:31:17,548 --> 01:31:19,163
I can't go to prison, guys!

1499
01:31:22,622 --> 01:31:25,267
Sam, you gotta get off
this road and lay low.

1500
01:31:35,842 --> 01:31:37,766
Man, they'll pick up.

1501
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:40,045
This is just called
blending in like a ninja.

1502
01:31:40,218 --> 01:31:41,904
How about I'll lay my piss
in your face?

1503
01:31:42,905 --> 01:31:43,669
They're gone.

1504
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:45,356
Wait another time.

1505
01:31:45,552 --> 01:31:46,690
How are you gonna make
the call to Lennox?

1506
01:31:46,725 --> 01:31:49,178
You are in the worldwide. What,
they're gonna tranquil in one base?

1507
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:50,658
They'll track you here
in seconds.

1508
01:31:50,659 --> 01:31:52,610
CIA is all over this place.

1509
01:31:52,622 --> 01:31:53,584
You're gonna call?

1510
01:31:58,862 --> 01:32:00,832
Okay,
that's--that's a good idea.

1511
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:02,479
- Alright?
- I mean I just was...

1512
01:32:02,948 --> 01:32:04,046
My mind in other things.

1513
01:32:04,081 --> 01:32:05,687
Like why don't you get
being chipped in prison.

1514
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:07,897
New Jersey

1515
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:10,568
<i>This departure:
2100 hours.</i>

1516
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,483
So we're shipped in
back to base.

1517
01:32:14,276 --> 01:32:15,700
This is central at stake.

1518
01:32:21,082 --> 01:32:23,310
Major Lennox, phone call.

1519
01:32:24,033 --> 01:32:25,939
Lennox, I'm with the kid.
The kid, you know?

1520
01:32:26,204 --> 01:32:27,242
One with the attitude break?

1521
01:32:27,243 --> 01:32:28,781
I need the truck.
The truck.

1522
01:32:28,816 --> 01:32:31,532
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1523
01:32:31,567 --> 01:32:32,683
You're not gonna believe
where we are.

1524
01:32:32,692 --> 01:32:35,817
Code Tot,
as in King Tutankhamen,

1525
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:37,514
back of a $1 bill.

1526
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:42,758
Coordinates for air-drop,
29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1527
01:32:42,793 --> 01:32:44,055
Get it.
Write it down, write it.

1528
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:45,424
Oh, my God.

1529
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:46,942
I gotta go, okay.
I hate the cops.

1530
01:32:46,943 --> 01:32:48,152
W-Wait, who are you?

1531
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:52,269
Wait, it's me.
Leo, me, Leo, Leo. Leo.

1532
01:32:52,372 --> 01:32:53,683
The cops are coming right now.
We need to go.

1533
01:32:56,745 --> 01:33:00,276
Coordinates
29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1534
01:33:00,277 --> 01:33:02,694
Tip of the Red Sea,
Gulf of Aqaba.

1535
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:04,041
Egypt.

1536
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:05,801
Are you serious?

1537
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:07,825
Sir.

1538
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:15,662
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there.

1539
01:33:15,663 --> 01:33:18,286
How is this little kid's
supposed to bring him back to life?

1540
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,032
I don't know.

1541
01:33:20,606 --> 01:33:22,012
But we gotta trust him.

1542
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:25,444
Okay, let's go
over it again.

1543
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:27,893
- When the dawn arise...
- When the dawn arise the dagger's tip,

1544
01:33:27,932 --> 01:33:30,005
- the three kings...
- ...will reveal the doorway.

1545
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,779
That's what he said.
You know what that means?

1546
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:33,685
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1547
01:33:33,686 --> 01:33:35,554
Oh my God, oh my God.
Checkpoint, checkpoint.

1548
01:33:35,589 --> 01:33:36,629
I don't have
my passport.

1549
01:33:38,925 --> 01:33:43,411
Passport.
Idiota (Idiot)!

1550
01:33:47,817 --> 01:33:49,059
They have cams at top.

1551
01:33:51,237 --> 01:33:52,965
He's the one
that they want.

1552
01:33:53,732 --> 01:33:55,787
Alright, chill.
Let's be nice to them.

1553
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,066
I can handle it.
These are my people.

1554
01:33:58,227 --> 01:34:00,124
- Yeah.
- I'm 136.

1555
01:34:02,615 --> 01:34:04,240
Oh great, a frickin' munchkin.

1556
01:34:04,275 --> 01:34:06,885
Oh, little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1557
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:15,689
- What do you want?
- I want to go to...

1558
01:34:15,765 --> 01:34:18,579
The Dagger's Tip, right?

1559
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:21,360
Egypt, Jordan.
We wanna go there.

1560
01:34:21,395 --> 01:34:23,224
Me and my family.
This is my family.

1561
01:34:23,596 --> 01:34:25,638
- This is my son, my other son.
- Hi there.

1562
01:34:25,673 --> 01:34:26,404
My daughter.

1563
01:34:26,525 --> 01:34:28,673
We're tourists
from New York.

1564
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:30,398
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1565
01:34:30,599 --> 01:34:31,704
50 kilometres.

1566
01:34:31,739 --> 01:34:33,134
We're going to get one
of your falafels, thank you!

1567
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:34,121
Yeah,
thank you very much.

1568
01:34:34,161 --> 01:34:36,122
- New York.
- I know, I know you from somewhere.

1569
01:34:36,636 --> 01:34:38,196
No, we do not work
for the CIA.

1570
01:34:42,646 --> 01:34:46,152
<i>Decepticons,
voice location.</i>

1571
01:34:46,346 --> 01:34:47,336
<i>Detected.</i>

1572
01:34:48,657 --> 01:34:51,799
Starscream in pursuit.

1573
01:34:56,147 --> 01:34:59,127
Undercover, yo, you gotta blend in
with your surrounding.

1574
01:34:59,157 --> 01:35:01,393
You know, you gotta be
part of the landscape.

1575
01:35:09,564 --> 01:35:10,277
Awesome.

1576
01:35:11,344 --> 01:35:12,556
I think
aliens built that.

1577
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:14,408
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1578
01:35:14,614 --> 01:35:16,089
Go, move it!
Move it.

1579
01:35:16,814 --> 01:35:17,573
- What?
- Hey, guard us.

1580
01:35:17,803 --> 01:35:19,136
Low-profile,
don't make a scene, okay?

1581
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,571
Yeah, some of us
got work to do!

1582
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:22,171
Dumb Autobots.

1583
01:35:25,588 --> 01:35:28,778
Estimated time of detachment
NEST, 0600 AM

1584
01:35:43,534 --> 01:35:45,575
Being my girlfriend
is hazardous to your health.

1585
01:35:47,319 --> 01:35:51,345
Yeah, well,
girls like dangerous boys.

1586
01:35:51,692 --> 01:35:53,038
- Really?
- Yeah.

1587
01:35:55,898 --> 01:35:57,525
Why don't you say it?

1588
01:35:58,268 --> 01:35:59,349
Ladies first.

1589
01:36:01,054 --> 01:36:03,361
Okay, so tonight,
you're gonna be a gentleman.

1590
01:36:03,878 --> 01:36:05,238
You're really chivalrous.

1591
01:36:05,608 --> 01:36:06,563
Why are you mad at me?

1592
01:36:07,148 --> 01:36:09,181
You know what?
Baby, I'm not...

1593
01:36:09,582 --> 01:36:11,066
I'm not mad.

1594
01:36:11,718 --> 01:36:16,125
You realise that I just flew 3,000 miles
to keep you from getting killed.

1595
01:36:16,284 --> 01:36:17,100
I know.

1596
01:36:20,728 --> 01:36:22,586
Who else could be
your girlfriend too?

1597
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:25,576
Look at the things
that go through with me.

1598
01:36:26,832 --> 01:36:29,244
And now we're underneath
the moon and the stars

1599
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:31,571
and the three most beautiful
pyramids on the planet

1600
01:36:31,612 --> 01:36:33,664
and you still can't even tell me
that you love me.

1601
01:36:37,338 --> 01:36:38,309
- What?
- Wait.

1602
01:36:38,344 --> 01:36:40,948
- Why do boys always change the subject?
- The moon and the stars...

1603
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:42,743
- Sam...
- Come with me really quick.

1604
01:36:50,588 --> 01:36:52,657
Simmons, Leo,
wake up!

1605
01:36:55,966 --> 01:36:58,208
Listen, Astronomy class, page 47,
you remember the class?

1606
01:36:58,243 --> 01:37:00,834
No, no, I was only in college
for two days, you remember that?

1607
01:37:00,869 --> 01:37:02,842
- Yeah, well, get up. Up, up.
- What are you talking about?

1608
01:37:08,508 --> 01:37:09,574
Can you see
those three stars?

1609
01:37:09,609 --> 01:37:11,318
You see how the last one
touches the horizon?

1610
01:37:11,641 --> 01:37:12,688
That's Orion's belt.

1611
01:37:13,008 --> 01:37:15,286
It's also called the Three Kings
and the reason for that is

1612
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:18,048
the three Egyptian kings who built
the pyramids in Giza built them

1613
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,223
to mear those stars.

1614
01:37:19,258 --> 01:37:21,047
So it's like an aerial staring
straight in the face.

1615
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:22,863
They all point due east
towards Jordan.

1616
01:37:23,195 --> 01:37:24,493
The mountains of Petra.

1617
01:37:37,668 --> 01:37:41,668
<i>We got a seatbelt malfunction.
We gotta have to divert...</i>

1618
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:43,293
<i>Flight in lower,
prepare for bail-out.</i>

1619
01:37:43,438 --> 01:37:45,650
Bail-out, bail-out,
bail-out, bail-out?

1620
01:37:45,685 --> 01:37:47,830
Alright, team,
grab your shoots.

1621
01:37:47,865 --> 01:37:48,629
Bail-out?

1622
01:37:51,178 --> 01:37:52,814
Familiar with the standard
MC-4?

1623
01:37:53,048 --> 01:37:55,856
Of course not. I've never jumped out
of a publicly good airplane before.

1624
01:37:56,088 --> 01:37:57,458
Wait a minute,
is this really happening?

1625
01:37:57,459 --> 01:37:57,873
Yeah.

1626
01:38:00,497 --> 01:38:01,958
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1627
01:38:02,437 --> 01:38:03,839
You're behind this,
aren't you?

1628
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:05,007
What are you talking about?

1629
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:07,133
You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around.

1630
01:38:08,325 --> 01:38:11,328
This is standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter.

1631
01:38:11,363 --> 01:38:12,569
Do you know
what you said?

1632
01:38:13,608 --> 01:38:15,994
You, just find the captain
and your career--

1633
01:38:21,564 --> 01:38:22,750
Wait, what was that?
What's that?

1634
01:38:22,932 --> 01:38:23,978
That's not good.

1635
01:38:24,492 --> 01:38:26,762
Come on.
Right this way, right this way!

1636
01:38:26,802 --> 01:38:27,524
I can't jump
out of an airplane.

1637
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:35,179
Come here.
Come here.

1638
01:38:36,381 --> 01:38:39,176
Because I have to secure
the VIPs first.

1639
01:38:39,177 --> 01:38:41,519
Okay, I want you
to listen very carefully.

1640
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,344
Remember as everything
that I say.

1641
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:46,826
East to the GPS trackers, so
you can be found by search and rescue.

1642
01:38:51,037 --> 01:38:52,422
- Look, are you listening?
- I can't.

1643
01:38:53,713 --> 01:38:55,364
- Alright, alright.
- Alright.

1644
01:38:55,448 --> 01:38:57,293
When the plane that shoot
inflates into the air,

1645
01:38:57,294 --> 01:38:59,393
pull the pin
and open some air,

1646
01:38:59,452 --> 01:39:01,655
break your rack up,
lose your primary.

1647
01:39:01,848 --> 01:39:03,157
I want you
to pull the blue.

1648
01:39:03,278 --> 01:39:05,018
I need you to pull it
really hard.

1649
01:39:05,811 --> 01:39:08,381
Not right now.
We're on the plane, you dumbass!

1650
01:39:11,692 --> 01:39:12,746
Did he say goodbye?

1651
01:39:12,806 --> 01:39:14,513
No, he didn't even
say goodbye.

1652
01:39:15,036 --> 01:39:16,682
<i>General,
we're loaded and ready.</i>

1653
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,753
<i>You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.</i>

1654
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,035
- Excellent.
- Sir,

1655
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,804
you need to see this.
Now.

1656
01:39:25,397 --> 01:39:27,055
Have we checked
these coordinates?

1657
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:28,497
Egypt, sir.
They're air-dropping in.

1658
01:39:28,517 --> 01:39:29,821
You gotta be kidding me.

1659
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:31,600
He knows something.

1660
01:39:31,718 --> 01:39:34,578
We need to be ready to back him up,
if this thing goes hot.

1661
01:39:35,445 --> 01:39:36,193
Copy that.

1662
01:39:36,718 --> 01:39:38,874
CIA just got a hit
on the boy.

1663
01:39:39,924 --> 01:39:41,989
Hundred miles from the location
on that little map there.

1664
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,793
It's getting hotter.

1665
01:39:47,468 --> 01:39:49,892
It's gotta be...
around here somewhere.

1666
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:31,738
It's here somewhere,
guys.

1667
01:40:31,778 --> 01:40:32,733
Oh yeah, why?

1668
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,780
'Cause we're trusting
Grandpa Blackbird

1669
01:40:34,815 --> 01:40:36,164
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

1670
01:40:36,234 --> 01:40:38,698
On his defense,
this is the biggest doorway

1671
01:40:38,733 --> 01:40:40,414
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1672
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,829
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, alright?

1673
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:45,192
Nope.

1674
01:40:45,341 --> 01:40:47,942
Ever questioned mind, guys, that
archaeologists have been here before.

1675
01:40:47,977 --> 01:40:48,883
There's nothing here.

1676
01:40:48,934 --> 01:40:51,260
You realise it's heart-break,
despair, kid.

1677
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:53,631
Sometimes, you get
to the end of the rainbow

1678
01:40:53,671 --> 01:40:55,831
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it.

1679
01:40:55,862 --> 01:40:57,534
I'm listening to you;
you live with your mother.

1680
01:40:59,268 --> 01:41:01,638
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1681
01:41:01,673 --> 01:41:03,281
Why are we still listening
to your little punk-ass?

1682
01:41:03,316 --> 01:41:05,412
I mean, what kind of dumbfucks
accept ding my rim?

1683
01:41:05,447 --> 01:41:07,448
Kill Megatron.
How about that?

1684
01:41:07,483 --> 01:41:09,090
Well, he doesn't get the job done,
you know, I mean,

1685
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,010
- 'cause he's zapped, man.
- You scared?

1686
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:12,892
Well, scared?
Scared of your ugly face.

1687
01:41:13,188 --> 01:41:15,769
I'm ugly?
Well, we twins, you stupid genius.

1688
01:41:22,758 --> 01:41:24,595
Guys!
Oh, hey!

1689
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:26,335
You like
the way that feels?

1690
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,974
- That ain't hurt.
- You got that, don't you?

1691
01:41:28,009 --> 01:41:28,797
I'm getting up--

1692
01:41:37,796 --> 01:41:38,970
Now that's rude.

1693
01:41:50,311 --> 01:41:52,616
Oh, my God!
The symbols.

1694
01:41:53,728 --> 01:41:55,352
Bee!
Shoot it.

1695
01:42:25,874 --> 01:42:26,385
Wow!

1696
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:28,145
This is the part
which they found silicon.

1697
01:42:29,422 --> 01:42:30,995
The Tomb of the Primes.

1698
01:42:49,482 --> 01:42:50,455
The Matrix.

1699
01:43:14,566 --> 01:43:16,874
Thousands of years
turned to dust.

1700
01:43:17,546 --> 01:43:19,198
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

1701
01:43:19,867 --> 01:43:20,781
Hear that?

1702
01:43:25,248 --> 01:43:27,993
US Air Force. C-17s.

1703
01:43:29,282 --> 01:43:31,804
You can't bring it back, Sam,
there's nothing left.

1704
01:43:32,058 --> 01:43:34,025
Look, look around you.

1705
01:43:34,283 --> 01:43:36,947
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all.

1706
01:43:36,982 --> 01:43:38,382
They just haven't
end like this.

1707
01:43:38,398 --> 01:43:40,241
There is a reason
that we're here.

1708
01:43:40,276 --> 01:43:42,662
The voices and the symbols
in my head led us here...

1709
01:43:42,663 --> 01:43:43,884
for a purpose.

1710
01:43:49,786 --> 01:43:51,856
Everyone's after me
because of what I know.

1711
01:43:54,176 --> 01:43:57,248
And what I know,
is that this is going to work.

1712
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:59,555
How do you know
it's going to work?

1713
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:01,083
Because I believe it.

1714
01:44:11,896 --> 01:44:13,927
Best put me out
of this plane.

1715
01:44:24,536 --> 01:44:27,305
He's dropping the big one.
Sam!

1716
01:44:34,843 --> 01:44:36,964
You think you can bring him
back to life with that pixie dust?

1717
01:44:36,999 --> 01:44:38,741
Absolutely.
Let's go!

1718
01:44:48,529 --> 01:44:49,212
Go!

1719
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,512
Move it!

1720
01:44:52,192 --> 01:44:53,514
Remember your friendly!

1721
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:05,097
Cover Optimus!

1722
01:45:08,370 --> 01:45:10,413
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1723
01:45:10,414 --> 01:45:12,493
Get snipers and Stingers
up high.

1724
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:15,265
So he just dropped off
ten tonnes of dead robot

1725
01:45:15,285 --> 01:45:16,339
in the middle of nowhere.

1726
01:45:16,913 --> 01:45:18,708
Hope this little kid
know what he's doing.

1727
01:45:18,743 --> 01:45:19,706
Yeah, me too.

1728
01:45:25,663 --> 01:45:29,052
Got a visual!
Yellow tee, four klicks.

1729
01:45:32,188 --> 01:45:33,330
Hot-flare!

1730
01:45:35,894 --> 01:45:37,701
That's them right there.
You see the flare?

1731
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:38,764
Right over there!
See it?

1732
01:45:40,099 --> 01:45:42,157
The boy has been found.

1733
01:45:49,604 --> 01:45:50,420
Sam!

1734
01:46:02,934 --> 01:46:04,430
Oh God, please God,

1735
01:46:04,459 --> 01:46:05,609
- please!
- Leo, stop freaking out.

1736
01:46:05,644 --> 01:46:07,934
- Just stop freaking out!
- Just drop this guy off, huh?

1737
01:46:07,969 --> 01:46:09,587
- Please let me live, just let me live.
- Stop freaking out!

1738
01:46:09,907 --> 01:46:11,449
Just stop screaming
right now. That's it.

1739
01:46:14,073 --> 01:46:15,998
Can't take that guy
anymore.

1740
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,113
We gotta split up.

1741
01:46:39,153 --> 01:46:42,045
Bumblebee, you are the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1742
01:46:42,368 --> 01:46:43,401
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1743
01:46:43,402 --> 01:46:45,424
I'll help throw their fire away.

1744
01:46:45,803 --> 01:46:47,312
You get to those soldiers.

1745
01:46:49,049 --> 01:46:50,519
I hope
that dust works, kid.

1746
01:46:50,948 --> 01:46:51,887
Thank you.

1747
01:46:55,894 --> 01:46:56,860
It's turning around.

1748
01:46:57,843 --> 01:46:59,183
It's coming back,
it's coming back.

1749
01:47:00,143 --> 01:47:01,183
It's up to me.

1750
01:47:01,353 --> 01:47:04,283
One man, alone, betrayed
by the country he loves,

1751
01:47:04,318 --> 01:47:06,778
now its last hope
in the final hour of need.

1752
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:09,334
The pants are to be driven
like never before.

1753
01:47:09,335 --> 01:47:10,454
Under my skin.

1754
01:47:10,908 --> 01:47:12,739
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't go nowhere.

1755
01:47:12,774 --> 01:47:14,823
- Drive!
- You will never make it, kid.

1756
01:47:14,858 --> 01:47:16,499
Bravery will only get you
so far.

1757
01:47:16,534 --> 01:47:19,136
You tased me, okay?
You owe me.

1758
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:20,184
- I'm go.
- Okay, okay.

1759
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:21,701
That was a test.
You passed, alright?

1760
01:47:29,389 --> 01:47:31,599
Thing's got alien tattoos
all over.

1761
01:47:31,997 --> 01:47:33,230
That ain't Air Force.

1762
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:38,338
What the hell was that?

1763
01:47:38,373 --> 01:47:40,111
- Eddy-1, copy.
- Anyone there?

1764
01:47:40,146 --> 01:47:40,815
Who's up?

1765
01:47:40,856 --> 01:47:42,277
- Copy.
- Radio's down.

1766
01:47:42,312 --> 01:47:43,745
It's dead.
Counter that.

1767
01:47:43,775 --> 01:47:44,818
EMP-burst.

1768
01:47:45,534 --> 01:47:48,437
Let's see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1769
01:47:50,424 --> 01:47:51,213
Yes, sir.

1770
01:47:51,253 --> 01:47:53,429
<i>Major Lennox told me
to pull the cord.</i>

1771
01:47:53,429 --> 01:47:53,996
I know, sir.

1772
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:56,689
W-Which, what country
am I in right now?

1773
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:58,043
United States.

1774
01:47:58,534 --> 01:48:02,218
No, no, not the United States.
I'm from the United States,

1775
01:48:02,258 --> 01:48:04,365
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere,
surrounded by goats.</i>

1776
01:48:05,503 --> 01:48:08,159
Well, that was
our good friend, Galloway.

1777
01:48:08,178 --> 01:48:10,028
He's less than pleased.

1778
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,994
How is it that
we can't reach our men,

1779
01:48:13,034 --> 01:48:18,768
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1780
01:48:22,542 --> 01:48:23,163
Nothing.

1781
01:48:24,019 --> 01:48:27,073
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky
know we need some help.

1782
01:48:27,108 --> 01:48:27,771
Yes, sir.

1783
01:48:29,689 --> 01:48:32,118
Pop some more flares
so that the kid can find us.

1784
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:41,375
There he is.
We got a couple of miles.

1785
01:48:41,794 --> 01:48:46,309
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1786
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:52,274
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1787
01:48:52,275 --> 01:48:54,644
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1788
01:48:54,995 --> 01:48:56,386
Our satellites in the area
have gone blind.

1789
01:48:56,421 --> 01:48:57,403
We're working it, sir.

1790
01:48:57,543 --> 01:48:58,567
Dammit.

1791
01:48:58,743 --> 01:49:01,292
Something's not right,
it doesn't add up.

1792
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:04,624
Contact the Jordanians, see what
their assets they've got in the area.

1793
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:07,010
And get Egypt's
General Salaam,

1794
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:11,145
ask him to clear some US
V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1795
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:14,171
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1796
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:15,829
Scramble predators now.

1797
01:49:16,171 --> 01:49:17,618
B-1, rotate.

1798
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,685
East on the mile
that way.

1799
01:49:37,077 --> 01:49:37,665
Come here.

1800
01:49:41,246 --> 01:49:42,048
This way.

1801
01:49:47,604 --> 01:49:51,037
- One man... alone...
- Stop saying that.

1802
01:49:51,072 --> 01:49:52,983
- betrayed by the country he loves.
- Oh my goodness,

1803
01:49:53,012 --> 01:49:54,899
I'm in the car, okay?
You're not alone.

1804
01:49:55,341 --> 01:49:57,129
Just relax,
you're looking nice well.

1805
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,923
I-I don't think
he's still following us.

1806
01:50:09,389 --> 01:50:10,559
That's what you think.

1807
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:31,697
Master, sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

1808
01:50:31,732 --> 01:50:34,711
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1809
01:50:35,002 --> 01:50:37,278
The boy must have
the Matrix.

1810
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:40,259
We cannot let him
reach Optimus.

1811
01:50:40,783 --> 01:50:42,612
Decepticons!

1812
01:50:42,774 --> 01:50:44,553
Begin our assault!

1813
01:50:45,437 --> 01:50:46,792
We got incoming!

1814
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:05,210
We got a whole load of
flight coming our way!

1815
01:51:05,962 --> 01:51:07,839
- How many?
- We got 13 to count.

1816
01:51:08,295 --> 01:51:10,899
This ain't good.
This ain't good.

1817
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:21,193
We 'bout to get
our asses whooped.

1818
01:51:24,022 --> 01:51:26,716
Alright, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1819
01:51:28,411 --> 01:51:31,251
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1820
01:51:31,286 --> 01:51:34,401
So our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1821
01:51:34,463 --> 01:51:36,297
Alright, we're gonna draw
fire from the left flag.

1822
01:51:36,359 --> 01:51:37,344
I need a scout team.

1823
01:51:38,213 --> 01:51:40,250
We'll walk through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide.

1824
01:51:40,832 --> 01:51:42,356
Alright, when you see
the precious cargo,

1825
01:51:42,406 --> 01:51:45,329
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back to those pillars.

1826
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:46,588
We'll have
the ambush set.

1827
01:51:46,925 --> 01:51:48,323
Alright, let's go,
move out!

1828
01:51:48,324 --> 01:51:48,959
- Move out!
- Move out!

1829
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:59,869
Did you see that film
Gunfire Aero-Kay Karao?

1830
01:52:01,905 --> 01:52:05,014
- Casting Kirk Douglas.
- No, why?

1831
01:52:08,089 --> 01:52:09,493
Looks like we're right
in the middle of it.

1832
01:52:09,932 --> 01:52:10,749
Is that good?

1833
01:52:13,206 --> 01:52:14,569
Lot of people died.

1834
01:52:31,048 --> 01:52:33,704
- Oh, oh, oh...
- Hide!

1835
01:52:35,993 --> 01:52:37,130
Oh my God!

1836
01:52:59,247 --> 01:53:00,357
Sam, Sam.

1837
01:53:04,258 --> 01:53:05,214
Get down, get down.

1838
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:11,165
Once, it's clear,
we'll run for Optimus

1839
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,568
as fast we can, okay?

1840
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:15,590
And what if
it doesn't work?

1841
01:53:16,735 --> 01:53:17,649
This will work.

1842
01:53:18,261 --> 01:53:20,086
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work.

1843
01:53:20,709 --> 01:53:21,612
It'll work.

1844
01:55:09,164 --> 01:55:10,227
Radio shell.

1845
01:55:29,565 --> 01:55:30,739
We got a half a mile.

1846
01:55:30,803 --> 01:55:32,384
I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1847
01:55:34,915 --> 01:55:35,583
Fall back!

1848
01:55:36,188 --> 01:55:37,743
Ironhide, up for middle.

1849
01:55:38,081 --> 01:55:39,232
Ironhide, move it.

1850
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:42,030
Go!
Go, go!

1851
01:55:53,785 --> 01:55:55,255
There's no way to go.
We're gonna die!

1852
01:55:55,256 --> 01:55:57,633
Listen, we're going out.
We're going out like men, understand?

1853
01:56:27,249 --> 01:56:29,352
- Oh.
- Look at this motherf--

1854
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:31,932
Mean robots suck!

1855
01:56:44,513 --> 01:56:45,280
Get back!

1856
01:56:50,302 --> 01:56:51,709
Grab it!
Don't let go.

1857
01:56:51,884 --> 01:56:53,328
Hang in, man,
I got this.

1858
01:56:58,297 --> 01:56:59,472
I don't wanna die.

1859
01:57:01,714 --> 01:57:03,653
Careful grip, boy.
Careful grip.

1860
01:57:09,308 --> 01:57:11,407
He did.
He got so waste.

1861
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:12,994
Who's your daddy
now, huh?

1862
01:57:13,029 --> 01:57:14,162
He got all these...

1863
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:16,448
Well, the safe place
is right under it.

1864
01:57:16,735 --> 01:57:19,046
Run it.
Run for his feet!

1865
01:57:27,517 --> 01:57:30,901
You're never eating me.
I'm gonna bust your face up.

1866
01:57:39,936 --> 01:57:42,303
Nobody's tested me.
In your face!

1867
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:44,634
Take five, Mudflap.

1868
01:57:45,945 --> 01:57:46,881
Oh my God!

1869
01:57:50,224 --> 01:57:52,069
Yeehaw!

1870
01:57:53,786 --> 01:57:55,631
Nobody messes
with the twins.

1871
01:57:58,647 --> 01:57:59,655
I got you.

1872
01:58:03,237 --> 01:58:05,562
Ow, man,
you shot me in the face!

1873
01:58:06,005 --> 01:58:08,259
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it.

1874
01:58:18,084 --> 01:58:19,904
Rampage, set up the trap.

1875
01:58:29,625 --> 01:58:30,112
Judy!

1876
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,442
- Sam!
- What?

1877
01:58:37,477 --> 01:58:38,251
Sam!

1878
01:58:39,009 --> 01:58:40,578
Sam! Sam!

1879
01:58:45,264 --> 01:58:46,286
Sam!

1880
01:58:46,795 --> 01:58:47,691
- Sam.
- Dad!

1881
01:58:55,729 --> 01:58:57,245
Wait! Wait!

1882
01:58:58,565 --> 01:58:59,313
Please listen--

1883
01:59:00,498 --> 01:59:02,116
I want you to run!
Run!

1884
01:59:02,156 --> 01:59:03,120
- Dad, just stop!
- Get out of here.

1885
01:59:03,155 --> 01:59:04,446
- They don't want you, they want me.
- Just run!

1886
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:06,107
Oh God, wait!

1887
01:59:06,192 --> 01:59:08,950
- Samuel Witwicky.
- Wait.

1888
01:59:10,915 --> 01:59:12,225
This is what you want.
You don't want 'em.

1889
01:59:12,677 --> 01:59:14,679
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop! Stop!

1890
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:16,628
- Why don't you--
- Just get out of here!

1891
01:59:17,753 --> 01:59:18,648
Just don't move.

1892
01:59:19,206 --> 01:59:19,854
I know you.

1893
01:59:20,075 --> 01:59:21,771
Just go!
Just go!

1894
01:59:21,806 --> 01:59:23,226
And I know what,
you need me.

1895
01:59:24,170 --> 01:59:25,276
Because I know about
the Matrix.

1896
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:27,720
- Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.
- Please, Dad.

1897
01:59:27,759 --> 01:59:28,714
They're gonna
kill us all anyway.

1898
01:59:28,749 --> 01:59:30,198
Hey, hey.
Look.

1899
01:59:30,199 --> 01:59:31,549
This is what you want.
I'm here.

1900
01:59:32,264 --> 01:59:33,487
Bumblebee!

1901
01:59:37,584 --> 01:59:38,332
Help!

1902
01:59:46,341 --> 01:59:48,261
Kill him, Bee.
Kill him.

1903
02:00:27,482 --> 02:00:28,696
Come on,
get in.

1904
02:00:42,855 --> 02:00:44,781
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1905
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:51,175
Hey! I don't know what's going on,
but we gotta move.

1906
02:00:54,799 --> 02:00:56,525
- Run!
- There's gotta be a way out of here.

1907
02:01:01,891 --> 02:01:03,807
Buckle up, buckle up!
Get in here.

1908
02:01:06,053 --> 02:01:08,200
Bee! Bumblebee!

1909
02:01:08,913 --> 02:01:10,768
You get them
somewhere safe, alright?

1910
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,552
You gotta get in the car.
You can be safe.

1911
02:01:14,592 --> 02:01:16,411
No, listen to my discussion.

1912
02:01:16,446 --> 02:01:17,834
- You're my son, alright?
- I know!

1913
02:01:17,835 --> 02:01:19,755
You're my son!
We'll all go together.

1914
02:01:19,795 --> 02:01:21,229
- Listen.
- We're all going together.

1915
02:01:21,264 --> 02:01:23,348
Dad, stop, okay?
Get in the car.

1916
02:01:23,383 --> 02:01:25,413
He's gonna get you to safety.
You don't, you run.

1917
02:01:25,448 --> 02:01:27,659
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.
You hear what I'm saying?

1918
02:01:27,902 --> 02:01:29,527
Okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1919
02:01:29,562 --> 02:01:31,021
- No.
- You gotta let me go, Dad.

1920
02:01:31,056 --> 02:01:32,414
You'll have
to let me go.

1921
02:01:33,045 --> 02:01:34,543
- You have to.
- Ron.

1922
02:01:37,049 --> 02:01:39,639
Ron, Ron!
Let him go.

1923
02:01:41,529 --> 02:01:42,668
Just come back!

1924
02:01:43,382 --> 02:01:44,690
- Come on!
- Come on!

1925
02:01:44,691 --> 02:01:45,867
Mikaela, Mikaela!

1926
02:01:45,868 --> 02:01:47,634
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go with them.

1927
02:02:06,009 --> 02:02:08,744
- We got Jordanians!
- We got help!

1928
02:02:32,826 --> 02:02:33,780
You okay, soldier?

1929
02:02:34,456 --> 02:02:35,834
We're gonna help you,
soldier.

1930
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:37,919
Let's get being moon
and clear the birds!

1931
02:02:37,954 --> 02:02:39,466
Stay still, stay still.
Don't move.

1932
02:02:40,067 --> 02:02:41,078
You alright, young man?

1933
02:02:41,305 --> 02:02:42,431
- You have a radio?
- Yes.

1934
02:02:43,774 --> 02:02:45,933
Hey kid,
it's been nice knowing you.

1935
02:02:46,115 --> 02:02:48,001
Remember what I did
for my country.

1936
02:02:49,436 --> 02:02:50,914
This is my moment.

1937
02:02:52,113 --> 02:02:53,347
You're crazy!

1938
02:02:55,319 --> 02:02:57,162
ETA to station,
two minutes.

1939
02:02:57,197 --> 02:02:59,054
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir, yes, sir.

1940
02:02:59,309 --> 02:03:00,340
Predator's air-one.

1941
02:03:10,747 --> 02:03:12,243
Oh shit, it's a trick.

1942
02:03:12,294 --> 02:03:14,739
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1943
02:03:14,774 --> 02:03:17,596
- Get those boys out of the ground.
- This is 101 in strike packages.

1944
02:03:17,664 --> 02:03:19,274
Fast course river.
Execute lightly.

1945
02:03:39,562 --> 02:03:41,668
- Spotted Sam.
- Hurry, don't slow up!

1946
02:03:42,704 --> 02:03:43,948
Ironhide!

1947
02:03:44,714 --> 02:03:46,907
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1948
02:03:47,042 --> 02:03:47,525
Look out!

1949
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:52,820
Sam, get to the pillars!

1950
02:03:54,092 --> 02:03:54,815
Let's go.

1951
02:03:58,759 --> 02:04:02,190
Oh God, this is it. The pyramids built
right over the machine.

1952
02:04:02,225 --> 02:04:03,692
They turn
that machine on...

1953
02:04:05,387 --> 02:04:06,432
no more Sun.

1954
02:04:09,059 --> 02:04:10,451
Not on my watch.

1955
02:04:10,578 --> 02:04:13,614
Not on my watch.

1956
02:04:24,402 --> 02:04:27,325
- USS Stennis, identify.
- <i>Hey, where the hell are you?</i>

1957
02:04:27,514 --> 02:04:28,346
<i>What, you're on
a weather channel?</i>

1958
02:04:28,386 --> 02:04:30,444
<i>Sports center,
high-dreaming TV or something?</i>

1959
02:04:30,474 --> 02:04:32,151
We get a pretty hundred
satellites up there.

1960
02:04:32,241 --> 02:04:34,630
Where the hell
are all our men?

1961
02:04:34,839 --> 02:04:36,406
Identify yourself.

1962
02:04:36,665 --> 02:04:38,000
What is your name, sailor?

1963
02:04:38,444 --> 02:04:43,600
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

1964
02:04:44,724 --> 02:04:46,289
Okay, Captain Wilder,

1965
02:04:46,278 --> 02:04:48,774
<i>this is Agent Seymour Simmons,
head of the Sector Seven.</i>

1966
02:04:48,885 --> 02:04:51,254
<i>There is a mother of
all non-biologicals</i>

1967
02:04:51,289 --> 02:04:53,079
<i>getting ready
to blow up our Sun.</i>

1968
02:04:53,371 --> 02:04:54,966
You want to have fooled down
about my lack of clearance,

1969
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:57,242
or you want to help
save a gazillion lives?

1970
02:04:57,875 --> 02:05:00,255
Alright, Agent Simmons.
I'm listening.

1971
02:05:07,453 --> 02:05:08,788
Five klicks.

1972
02:05:09,332 --> 02:05:10,486
<i>West of the gulf.</i>

1973
02:05:10,487 --> 02:05:13,417
<i>We got ourselves a dalion
remodelling a pyramid.</i>

1974
02:05:13,899 --> 02:05:16,899
I want hopes of prototype weapon
pull a rail gun.

1975
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:19,547
That's classified.

1976
02:05:19,788 --> 02:05:23,649
Don't talk to me
about classified, alright?

1977
02:05:23,684 --> 02:05:25,417
Now if you've got
a battleship in the gulf

1978
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:29,211
you tell him to ready
that weapon!

1979
02:05:30,221 --> 02:05:32,639
Contact Destroyer,
USS Kit.

1980
02:05:34,976 --> 02:05:36,706
This way!
Move it!

1981
02:05:38,674 --> 02:05:40,440
What you need is there.

1982
02:05:40,912 --> 02:05:42,600
Let's go! Go!

1983
02:05:46,415 --> 02:05:47,935
Give me your talk.
Come on.

1984
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:48,622
Epps!

1985
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:54,791
Right now,
we need air support.

1986
02:05:55,985 --> 02:05:57,248
That ship's in contact.
20 miles--

1987
02:05:57,717 --> 02:05:59,884
Grid on contact.
Proceed 88, Alpha Sierra.

1988
02:06:03,858 --> 02:06:06,941
USS Stenin 0-9-0,
you are approved to drop a 2,000--

1989
02:06:15,007 --> 02:06:16,288
- What you got?
- A detonator, sir.

1990
02:06:16,289 --> 02:06:18,320
They're 600 minutes away and
they're heading right for the pillars.

1991
02:06:18,355 --> 02:06:19,024
Alright.

1992
02:06:19,764 --> 02:06:21,161
Precious cargo's coming.

1993
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,245
Move!

1994
02:06:48,784 --> 02:06:49,668
Sam!

1995
02:06:49,963 --> 02:06:51,128
Spotted Sam.

1996
02:07:23,542 --> 02:07:24,034
Come on!

1997
02:07:24,083 --> 02:07:26,890
2-2, covering fire.
Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

1998
02:07:35,167 --> 02:07:36,161
Cover for us.

1999
02:07:43,179 --> 02:07:46,154
Okay, air strike.
We'll rescue the civilians.

2000
02:08:05,665 --> 02:08:07,531
Come on. Get up!

2001
02:08:07,963 --> 02:08:08,447
Come on!

2002
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:10,442
Get in here.

2003
02:08:11,265 --> 02:08:12,444
Oh look
who showed up.

2004
02:08:12,705 --> 02:08:14,797
You better have a good reason
for us to be here.

2005
02:08:14,828 --> 02:08:15,719
Where's Optimus?

2006
02:08:15,949 --> 02:08:17,785
He's right over there,
across the courtyard.

2007
02:08:18,898 --> 02:08:19,777
I got to get to him
right now.

2008
02:08:19,812 --> 02:08:21,230
No, we got
an air strike coming.

2009
02:08:21,231 --> 02:08:22,706
I have to get to him
right now.

2010
02:08:24,788 --> 02:08:26,252
Come here,
b-back.

2011
02:08:36,287 --> 02:08:37,864
Incoming!

2012
02:08:41,846 --> 02:08:44,788
Behold to the only
Jetfire!

2013
02:08:45,979 --> 02:08:49,636
Now let me show you
how we brought them pain in my day.

2014
02:09:09,594 --> 02:09:10,977
Too old
for this crap.

2015
02:09:11,012 --> 02:09:12,031
Keep going.

2016
02:09:12,032 --> 02:09:13,382
15 minutes of fighting.

2017
02:09:33,508 --> 02:09:37,319
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

2018
02:09:38,072 --> 02:09:40,277
<i>25.7 metres
above sea level,</i>

2019
02:09:40,328 --> 02:09:41,466
<i>29.32 north.</i>

2020
02:09:41,501 --> 02:09:43,683
- Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.
- Target acquired.

2021
02:09:43,755 --> 02:09:44,870
Killing track two.

2022
02:09:45,057 --> 02:09:46,878
<i>Lock. Fire.</i>

2023
02:10:01,858 --> 02:10:03,818
Yeah! Yeah!

2024
02:10:03,853 --> 02:10:05,784
<i>B-1, stand on my target.
30 seconds...</i>

2025
02:10:07,572 --> 02:10:09,750
We're gonna make a break
for the beast on my command, okay?

2026
02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:11,669
You guys stick with me,
you understand?

2027
02:10:11,704 --> 02:10:12,977
You stay on my ass.

2028
02:10:14,562 --> 02:10:16,417
Hope these F-16s
got good aim.

2029
02:10:16,418 --> 02:10:17,317
Yeah, why is that?

2030
02:10:17,739 --> 02:10:19,369
I told them
to hit the orange smoke.

2031
02:10:21,197 --> 02:10:22,366
You mean
that orange smoke?

2032
02:10:22,838 --> 02:10:24,605
It wasn't my best toss,
okay?

2033
02:10:26,307 --> 02:10:27,834
- Run!
- Run!

2034
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:37,824
Incoming!

2035
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:41,545
Come on.

2036
02:11:15,574 --> 02:11:16,502
Die!

2037
02:11:23,470 --> 02:11:24,819
Sam!

2038
02:11:40,869 --> 02:11:42,683
Hold your fire!

2039
02:11:44,921 --> 02:11:45,542
Sam!

2040
02:11:47,619 --> 02:11:49,916
Get out!
Get me an EVAC.

2041
02:11:51,948 --> 02:11:54,093
Can't you do something?

2042
02:12:29,147 --> 02:12:31,207
- Sam! Sam...
- Sam!

2043
02:12:37,874 --> 02:12:40,389
Come on, we got to move.
We got to move! Come on!

2044
02:12:45,497 --> 02:12:46,451
Sammy!

2045
02:12:50,293 --> 02:12:53,728
Clear! Take a shot.
Clear! Take a shot.

2046
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:54,976
One, two, three.

2047
02:12:58,092 --> 02:12:58,715
Do it again.

2048
02:13:04,524 --> 02:13:06,364
Sam!

2049
02:13:08,201 --> 02:13:13,339
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

2050
02:13:14,172 --> 02:13:19,522
Please, please come back to me.
Sam, please! I love you!

2051
02:13:31,272 --> 02:13:33,094
Am I dead?

2052
02:13:33,884 --> 02:13:38,187
We have been watching you.
A long, long time.

2053
02:13:40,473 --> 02:13:42,525
You have fought
for Optimus,

2054
02:13:42,697 --> 02:13:47,180
our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice.

2055
02:13:47,215 --> 02:13:49,836
The virtues of a leader.

2056
02:13:50,292 --> 02:13:53,399
A leader
worthy of our secret.

2057
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:56,601
The Matrix of Leadership
is not found.

2058
02:13:57,123 --> 02:13:58,538
It is earned.

2059
02:13:59,633 --> 02:14:01,910
Return now to Optimus,

2060
02:14:02,542 --> 02:14:04,781
merge the Matrix
with his Spark.

2061
02:14:05,472 --> 02:14:10,160
It is, and always has been,
your destiny.

2062
02:14:14,957 --> 02:14:15,941
Sam.

2063
02:14:22,282 --> 02:14:23,617
I love you.

2064
02:15:02,431 --> 02:15:05,334
Boy, you returned
for me.

2065
02:15:06,781 --> 02:15:08,792
A living Prime!

2066
02:15:10,318 --> 02:15:12,753
I don't believe it.

2067
02:15:23,165 --> 02:15:25,802
My Matrix.

2068
02:15:31,177 --> 02:15:32,476
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

2069
02:15:33,692 --> 02:15:34,959
Get up, Prime!

2070
02:15:36,748 --> 02:15:40,244
- Oh, no.
- He's turned on the machine.

2071
02:15:41,047 --> 02:15:42,767
You gotta stop him.
Get up!

2072
02:15:43,089 --> 02:15:44,638
Optimus!

2073
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:49,190
Fallen, my master.

2074
02:15:49,361 --> 02:15:53,686
My brothers could not
stop me from this.

2075
02:15:54,699 --> 02:15:59,245
- Yes.
- Now I claim your sun.

2076
02:16:02,103 --> 02:16:03,770
Enemy target,
top of pyramid.

2077
02:16:03,771 --> 02:16:05,920
Engage,
engage, engage.

2078
02:16:11,278 --> 02:16:14,194
In moments,
we'll be at siren strength.

2079
02:16:29,978 --> 02:16:34,425
I never did a thing
worth doing until now.

2080
02:16:35,108 --> 02:16:37,881
Optimus,
take my parts.

2081
02:16:38,093 --> 02:16:40,995
And you'll have a power
you've never known.

2082
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:44,081
Fulfill your destiny.

2083
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:52,362
Jolt, electrify!

2084
02:17:12,916 --> 02:17:14,564
Let's roll.

2085
02:17:17,025 --> 02:17:18,872
Fire. Take it off
to the pyramid!

2086
02:17:30,913 --> 02:17:34,550
This planet
will be dark forever.

2087
02:17:56,870 --> 02:17:59,110
Die
like your brother.

2088
02:17:59,713 --> 02:18:02,022
They were
your brothers too.

2089
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:32,891
First gra--

2090
02:18:45,773 --> 02:18:47,829
You picked
the wrong planet!

2091
02:18:50,763 --> 02:18:52,756
Give me your face.

2092
02:19:01,214 --> 02:19:05,338
I rise.
You fall.

2093
02:19:07,434 --> 02:19:10,623
No. No.

2094
02:19:12,108 --> 02:19:16,846
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes,

2095
02:19:16,847 --> 02:19:20,561
cowards do survive.

2096
02:19:21,092 --> 02:19:23,025
This isn't over.

2097
02:19:50,436 --> 02:19:53,256
You took all of this for you
to tell me that you love me.

2098
02:19:54,973 --> 02:19:56,443
You said it first.

2099
02:20:48,609 --> 02:20:51,020
Thank you, Sam,
for saving my life.

2100
02:20:52,476 --> 02:20:53,028
You're welcome.

2101
02:20:54,504 --> 02:20:56,234
Thank you
for believing in me.

2102
02:21:00,949 --> 02:21:05,585
<i>Our races united by a history
long forgotten.</i>

2103
02:21:05,586 --> 02:21:08,886
<i>And a future
we shall face together.</i>

2104
02:21:09,609 --> 02:21:13,863
<i>I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message</i>

2105
02:21:13,898 --> 02:21:17,133
<i>so that our past
will always be remembered.</i>

2106
02:21:17,134 --> 02:21:20,918
<i>For in those memories,
we live on.</i>
