1
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:49,007
- Hey, hey Hey-hey-hey
- Let's sweat!

2
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,177
- Macho, macho man
- Macho man

3
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,179
- Come on!
- I've got to be

4
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,597
- That's right! Shake it, honey!
- A macho man

5
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,016
Macho, macho man

6
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,770
- Oh, yeah! Like a pony! I'm a pony!
- I've got to be a macho

7
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:06,524
Don't you feel like
a pony when you sweat?

8
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,193
- Oh, yeah! Yeah! Go!
- I've got to be

9
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,195
- Go! Do it! Come on!
- A macho man

10
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,029
Macho, macho man

11
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,366
Here we go! One! Two!
This is my favorite exercise!

12
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,368
Come on! Five!

13
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,370
- Macho, macho man
- Whoa!

14
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,957
- Macho! Macho! Ohh!
- I've got to be

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,709
- I'm a pony!
- A macho man

16
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:29,671
Come on. Let's go!
Do it! Come on!

17
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:33,716
- I've got to be a macho
- I'm vogueing! You can vogue!

18
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,218
Can you feel it?

19
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:38,345
I've got to be

20
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:40,347
- A macho man
- Ohh!

21
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:45,352
I'm going to have an aneurysm.
Ohh! My calves are burning!

22
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,735
This is our science department.

23
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:55,737
The genetics wing.

24
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,365
I'll remind you we are
in the vanguard of research.

25
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:43,406
Get Klump in here now.

26
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:45,408
- Professor Klump.
- Good mornin'.

27
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,410
- Hey, Professor!
- Good mornin'!

28
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:49,412
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

29
00:02:49,454 --> 00:02:52,582
- Good morning, Professor Klump.
- Morning. How are you?

30
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:03,801
Mornin'.

31
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,836
Aaaaaah!

32
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:46,508
Oh, my goodness.

33
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:58,352
Professor Klump, the cages-
what happened?

34
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:02,607
That is most peculiar, Jason, because I
distinctly remember locking up last night.

35
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,194
I locked these cages, picked up
my portfolio and turned around-

36
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:14,284
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

37
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,828
I must've grazed the switch.
Ha-ha.

38
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,501
Shelley's the only one
that didn't get out.

39
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:19,971
Oh. Good. I'll tend to Shelley.

40
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:22,876
You students take care of this.
Excuse me.

41
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,296
Hello, Shelley. How are you today,
my little powder puff?

42
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,881
Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:30,883
Sir?

44
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:33,719
You may want to look at
the latest test results.

45
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:37,223
I'm not sure if I'm
reading them correctly.

46
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,738
Three ounces. She's lost three
ounces since the last feed?

47
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,036
Must be some kind of mistake.

48
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:46,981
No, no, Jason. Her entire molecular
structure has been realigned.

49
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:51,820
We've done it.
This new formula's working.

50
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,822
It's actually reconstructed
Shelley's DNA.

51
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:57,033
She lost 20 percent
of her body fat in one feeding.

52
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:59,035
What if we upped the dosage?

53
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:02,580
No, one step at a time.
We don't want to jeopardize Shelley.

54
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:04,581
- We'll keep the feedings as scheduled.
- Okay.

55
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,583
Schedule. Excuse me.
I'm very late.

56
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:10,587
Students, we got a lot of work to do
and don't have much time to do it in.

57
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:14,591
Tryin' to win a grant here. So, as
Arsenio used to say, let's get busy!

58
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:38,613
- Comfy?
- Quite.

59
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:42,200
Anything I can get for you?
Juice? Coffee? Rack of lamb?

60
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,202
No, sir, I'm fine.

61
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:56,797
You, uh, did want to see me
about something, didn't you, sir?

62
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,300
Well, Professor Klump,

63
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:02,803
allow me to answer that question
by posing another.

64
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:06,098
- Why are you trying to destroy my school?
- Beg your pardon, sir?

65
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,644
- Do you know who Louise Vindovik is?
- Oh, surely, sir.

66
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,209
She's a lovely woman who
so generously donates

67
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,139
money to help fund our science department.

68
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,940
Ooh! Close.
Very close. But wrong.

69
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:21,112
See, she was a lovely woman, and she
used to fund our science department.

70
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:24,115
That was before she was hospitalized
for nearly swallowing a gerbil.

71
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:26,117
Not gerbil, sir.
A hamster.

72
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:29,621
Gerbils are more streamlined and
hamsters have a tendency to be fluffier.

73
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:32,623
The male hamster's scrotum has
a tendency to be disproportionately-

74
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:34,958
Never mind.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,960
Those National Rifle people
are right.

76
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:39,963
If I had one now- bang.

77
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:42,341
Sir, I'd like to concentrate
on the positives.

78
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:45,344
What Ms. Vindovik witnessed
was 5,000 healthy hamsters...

79
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,971
bred from a genetically deficient
hereditary line.

80
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,972
It's actually very exciting.

81
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:51,974
Do I look excited, Klump?

82
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:54,477
Uh, no, you don't
look excited at all.

83
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,480
But maybe you might be holding it in,
your excitement,

84
00:06:57,522 --> 00:07:00,358
not wanting to...
express it.

85
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,195
Now listen to me carefully,
you fat tub of goo.

86
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:09,366
For years you've single-handedly
alienated every wealthy donor we've had.

87
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,868
Air-conditioning schools
are outdrawing us!

88
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,579
We've lost so much money,
red is our school color.

89
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:17,707
Inner-city schools
have better computers than we do.

90
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,001
Bosnia wants to give us money!

91
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:22,013
I'm going to set up a
meeting with Harlan Hartley

92
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:23,364
Klump! Are you listening?

93
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:24,539
Uh, yes, sir. Yes.

94
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,494
Hartley is the last rich alumnus we've got.

95
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:30,344
And he's a science fan.

96
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:34,306
And he's considering donating
a $10 million grant to this school.

97
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,309
And I want that money, Klump.

98
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:39,311
Your job depends upon it.

99
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,104
I'll let you know how to handle it,
since I'll be watching you. Now go.

100
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:43,431
But, sir, I don't know
if you should

101
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,488
Ah-ah-ah.

102
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:48,862
See, right back there, just before
you said, "But, sir-" Right there?

103
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,115
That was the end
of the meeting.

104
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:54,117
Well, I guess
I'll leave.

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,119
You have a pleasant day.

106
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,390
Grace, the cream
has turned again.

107
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:29,192
Of all the equations you'll learn
during the course of your studies here,

108
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,237
this equation shall be,
I promise you,

109
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,740
the most helpful throughout
the course of your studies,

110
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:40,744
because this equation
fundamentally breaks down...

111
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:45,457
what DNA is composed of...

112
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,459
and what components of DNA-

113
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:52,797
I seem to have messed myself.

114
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,509
I haven't really messed myself.
I mean, I messed my shirt up.

115
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:02,640
But, uh, make sure you read chapter four
in your textbooks on genetics.

116
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,683
Gon' be a pop quiz
on Wednesday.

117
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,686
There's a pop quiz.
Pop quiz.

118
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:46,348
Professor Klump?

119
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:57,900
- Hello.
- Oh. Hi. I'm sorry.

120
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:01,863
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was looking for Professor Klump.

121
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:06,241
I'm him. I'm he.

122
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:08,493
I'm Sherman Klump-

123
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:11,872
Never mind. I do that all the time.

124
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:16,042
Makes the table look more festive,
and the kids enjoy it.

125
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:18,753
The yellow and green
and purple rolling around.

126
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,839
The table's more colorful and...

127
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,831
Would another time
be better? I could always...

128
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,196
No, no, don't be ridiculous.

129
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:28,429
I'm between classes
and I got a m-minute to chat.

130
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:31,557
- How can I help you?
- Hi. I'm Carla Purty.

131
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,747
- Hello, Miss Purty.
- I'm a grad student.

132
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:37,095
I'm teaching my first chemistry
class across the hall.

133
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,284
Okay. Mm-hmm.

134
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:40,704
I just had to come over
and introduce myself,

135
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:45,028
because I've followed your work
for many years, and I'm a big fan.

136
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:47,530
Oh, well, thank you very much.
I'm fatter...

137
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:51,176
uh, flattered that you've been
following my work the way you have.

138
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:57,707
A chemistry teacher. Chemistry sure
is important to have... chemistry...

139
00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:00,542
to have and use it.

140
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:04,797
Chemically- Chemistry. Well-

141
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,591
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

142
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,260
Oh, the pleasure was
all mine, Miss Purty.

143
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,429
And, um, hope to
see you around.

144
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,307
Well, you can't miss me.

145
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,100
Have a good day.

146
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:20,102
You do the same,
Miss Purty.

147
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,651
Mm-mmm-mmm.

148
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,445
Now, that's fine.
She's fine.

149
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,784
Oh, this is so fabulous.

150
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:39,287
Ain't nothin' like gettin' together
with family and havin' a good meal.

151
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:41,289
Cletus, take this bowl.
It's hot.

152
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:44,793
Goddamn, Sherman, it's almost
like we don't see your ass no more.

153
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:46,795
Good to see you, son.

154
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:50,257
You think you too good to spend time
with your family every now and then?

155
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:51,701
I've been real busy, Ernie.

156
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:54,277
I don't want no potatoes.
Mashed potatoes give me gas.

157
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:59,140
You know in my day, Sherman, people
used to spend time with they family

158
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:01,267
on Sundays
and special occasions.

159
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:03,039
Come around
and pay their respects.

160
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,234
You mess around and miss
little Ernie's golden

161
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:07,542
years, you're gonna be mad at yourself.

162
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,562
Oh baby's got a little gas.

163
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:16,698
Here she goes. Y'all
better cover your plates.

164
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,992
Mama, have some water.

165
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,785
Grandma, you spit on me.

166
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,997
What you talkin' about, coverin'
your plates? Not tonight, Cletus.

167
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,874
- I'll kick yo' ass.
- Sherman.

168
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,667
I cooked all this food.
Is that all you gonna eat?

169
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:31,670
You supposed to eat that,
not scalp it.

170
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:34,840
Daddy, all the calories in the
chicken are found in the skin.

171
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:39,011
"Where all the calories is"? You know
where that come from? Watching that damn TV.

172
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:43,599
Every time you turn it on somebody
talkin' about lose weight, get healthy.

173
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:44,852
Everybody lookin' all anorexic, talkin'

174
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,739
about that's healthy.
I know what healthy is.

175
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:50,855
And I don't know why everybody tryin'
to lose weight in the first place!

176
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:53,858
Ain't everybody supposed to be
the same size. We're all different.

177
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,861
Big, small, medium, midgets.
You supposed to have all that.

178
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,822
Everybody wants to be the same
size, like that Oprah Winfrey.

179
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:02,199
She gon' lose her weight.
Wasn't nothin' wrong

180
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,185
with her. She was fine. Oprah was a fox!

181
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,962
She lose all that weight,
her head look all big.

182
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:07,070
skin hanging all over.

183
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,248
And Luther Vandross.
Nigger used to be the black Pavarotti.

184
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,917
Lost all that weight,
lookin' all ashy.

185
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,086
Oprah and Luther need to keep their
ass one weight, 'cause I'm confused.

186
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,423
Yes, I hope nothin's wrong with Oprah.
She doesn't look well.

187
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:22,426
There ain't nothin' wrong with Oprah.
I seen Oprah on Hard Copy last week.

188
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,056
Was the picture of health. Got her a tall,
young, strong gentleman named Steadman.

189
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,058
So handsome.

190
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,560
- Amazing grace
- She's my favorite out of all of 'em-

191
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,271
Jenny Jones, Marilyn Kagan,
Maury Povich.

192
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,024
Letterman, Leno.

193
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,192
Montel, Ricki Lake.

194
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:42,278
- I like Geraldo.
- Mike Douglas. Ohh, Mike Douglas.

195
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:46,533
You know, Mike Douglas used to
make me moist when I'd watch his show.

196
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:51,871
I admit it. Only white man
ever did that to me was Mike Douglas.

197
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:55,249
I would like to volunteer to take
this old bird out of her misery.

198
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,326
Cletus! Don't you dare
say that about Mama.

199
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:58,554
No, no, hold it.

200
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:02,756
You ain't gotta protect me from Cletus.
Come on, Cletus.

201
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:07,928
Come on over here. It ain't
but a short walk. Come on over.

202
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:11,932
You gonna limp back. You'll walk over,
but you're limpin' back.

203
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:16,227
But don't let the gray hair fool ya.
I ain't no easy win, nigger.

204
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:20,273
Your problem is, you don't work out.
Look. That's all muscle.

205
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:22,275
- Ohh!
- You fat. I'm muscle.

206
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:25,319
Ohh, look at my little b-
He's a little Hercules.

207
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,488
Show me your muscles
again. Ohh!

208
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:30,158
Hercules, Hercules,
Hercules, Hercules!

209
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:34,744
Once you work out, your metabolism starts
to speed up, you can eat anything you want.

210
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,997
- He's so strong.
- Recent studies have shown...

211
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,000
that certain people are genetically
predisposed to gaining weight.

212
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,461
Someday we might even
find a cure.

213
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,963
Only thing you need to study
is your ass.

214
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:48,008
- I got a big ass. Your mama got a big ass.
- Cletus!

215
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:51,343
You do have a big ass.
Asses is big in our family.

216
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:55,139
You need to get used to that.
I don't care what diet you go on.

217
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:58,517
You can sew up your stomach and your asshole
- you gon' always be fat.

218
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:02,855
AII I'm tryin' to say is scientific
breakthroughs are occurring all the time.

219
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:07,317
The only thing about to break through is
your ass through the seat of your pants.

220
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,821
Sherman, I think I do remember hearing
something on TV about colon cleansin'.

221
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,823
They say everyone
should have one.

222
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:17,452
I'm thinkin' about gettin' me an appointment
and gettin' my colon cleansed thoroughly.

223
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,371
You want your colon cleansed?
I'm gon' clean mine.

224
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:23,333
There. Now my colon is clean.
Squeaky clean.

225
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:27,669
Every time we have a meal, you break
gas. Don't break gas and destroy our meal.

226
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:30,214
You the one that brought up
colon cleansin'!

227
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,300
I did not say anything
about breakin' gas!

228
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,511
You can talk about puttin' a tube in
somebody's ass, but I can't break wind.

229
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,404
I didn't say nothin' 'bout puttin'
a hose up nobody's ass.

230
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,117
What you think a colonic is?

231
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:40,941
You think you run your
asshole by the car wash?

232
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,254
You're chokin' the baby.

233
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:45,895
As long as I pay the bills,
I do what I want at this table.

234
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,897
Case in point.

235
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,400
- Who that called my name?
- Yeah, I called you if your name is-

236
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:55,196
Keep insulting me.

237
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,741
I'll toss this between
the crack of your ass.

238
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,368
I can go all night.

239
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:04,412
I hope you fart
'til your asshole falls out.

240
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,708
Ohh, my baby too!

241
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,670
Oops. Now see what you made me do?

242
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,672
Goddamn it,
I messed up my pants.

243
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:17,174
- Damn, Daddy. You rotten.
- You got to clean 'em yourself!

244
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:22,388
Oh, Lord, this has been a fabulous,
wonderful, fabulous evening.

245
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:24,856
Look. Them dogs done
tore up my garbage.

246
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:27,126
Cletus, the dog's ripped
open the garbage again!

247
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:28,497
Shoot the damn dog!

248
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:31,897
- I'm not shootin' no dog!
- I'm tryin' to watch Roseanne!

249
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:34,899
- Thanks for dinner, Mama.
- Sherman, what's wrong with you?

250
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:39,070
Baby, you still worried
about what your father said in there?

251
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:41,281
Oh, son, listen to me.

252
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:43,366
You are special.

253
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:48,746
When the good Lord made you,
he made you beautiful inside and out.

254
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,748
You can do anything, Sherman.

255
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,460
All you got to do is believe
in yourself and you can do anything.

256
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:58,088
You're so handsome.

257
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:00,090
Gimme some sugar.

258
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,552
Love you, Mama.

259
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:07,222
Love you too, baby.
Nighty-night. Ohh, my baby.

260
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:10,225
Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
Fabulous.

261
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:12,226
Cletus, come clean
this garbage up!

262
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,104
- I'm watchin' TV!
- Get your lazy ass up.

263
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:18,107
- Mind your own damn business!
- You lazy mother-

264
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:52,807
Professor?

265
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,478
Oh. Hi, C-
Uh, Miss Purty, um-

266
00:17:57,561 --> 00:18:02,650
You caught me in the middle of a little
step aerobics I was doin' out here.

267
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:06,152
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine,
one hundred.

268
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:10,115
I looked your address up in the faculty
directory. I hope you don't mind.

269
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,219
No, not at all. What can I do for you?

270
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,051
Oh, well, I was, uh...

271
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,249
I was, um-

272
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,960
I was wonderin' if-
one night if, uh-

273
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,962
when you weren't busy-

274
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,257
You get a little hungry,
you might want to, you know, uh-

275
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,761
If you planned on going out to get
somethin' anyway, on an occasion like that,

276
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,180
you don't wanna
do that alone, so-

277
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:38,517
Professor, are you
asking me out on a date?

278
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,855
Yes. Yes, I am.

279
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:47,692
I'd love to.

280
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,902
- Really?
- Yes.

281
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,655
That's fantastic! We can
go any place you wanna go.

282
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,657
Just name it.
We'll go there.

283
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:58,063
Uh, there's a place my students
go to called The Scream?

284
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:58,859
The Scream?

285
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,581
- I mean, if that's too-
- Oh, no, no, no. I love to scream.

286
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:04,708
Who-o-o-oa!

287
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:07,544
Screaming's good for you.
Cleans the epiglottis.

288
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:10,547
Get all the phlegm and mucus
down. That's disgusting.

289
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,549
- Just tell me what night.
- How's Friday?

290
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:16,594
Friday night's perfect. The best night
of the week. Friday night at 8:00.

291
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,597
- Friday night at 8:00.
- Great. I'll see you Friday night.

292
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,267
We'll go to The Scream.
It'll be a scream at The Scream.

293
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,229
- All right, Professor, I'll see you then.
- Good night, Miss Purty.

294
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,231
Good night.

295
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:31,734
Yes!

296
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:35,862
Mmm. Yeah, Friday night
at The Scream.

297
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:37,864
Gonna scream-

298
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:41,451
Friday night Friday,
Friday, Friday Friday night

299
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:43,453
Friday, Friday, Friday

300
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:48,750
I got myself a date

301
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,918
Friday night at 8:00

302
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,253
And I will not be late

303
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:55,672
She might be my mate

304
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:57,883
That would be so great

305
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:00,219
Great, great, great
Great, great, great

306
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,513
And I can hardly wait

307
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:06,100
Lilo, Peabo, Lou Rawls-
Teddy Pendergrass. Teddy P.

308
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,102
Number six! Yeah!

309
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,229
Whoo!

310
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,107
Close the door

311
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:18,277
- Let me give you what you been waitin' for
- Whoo!

312
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:23,825
- Baby, I got so much love to give
- Don't hurt 'em, Teddy P!

313
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:29,287
And I wanna give it all to you

314
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:34,126
I waited all day long

315
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,297
Just to hold you in my arms

316
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:45,594
And it's exactly like
I thought it would be

317
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:50,975
Me lovin' you
and you lovin' me

318
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:53,644
Ohh, you know you got-ta, got-ta,
got-ta close the door

319
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:56,647
Shut the hell up up there, goddamn it!

320
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,651
Sorry about that down there, Mr.
Wilson! Teddy P turned up a little loud.

321
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:01,484
Quiet down up there!

322
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:06,614
There is a thin person inside
each and every one of us!

323
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:11,828
So give yourselves a big hug and say,
"Yes, I can!" Do that for me!

324
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:15,790
Thighmaster Plus is designed
to give you better results quicker.

325
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:19,543
I lost ten pounds in two weeks.
Thanks, Megashake.

326
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:06,171
Aaaaaah!

327
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:08,173
You're not pathetic!

328
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:11,176
People, pounds do not
lose themselves!

329
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:13,552
You have to work,
work, work!

330
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:15,554
Everybody, up!
Come on! Up!

331
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:18,057
You too at home!
Everybody up and say:

332
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:22,061
- Yes, I can!
- Say it again!

333
00:22:22,144 --> 00:22:24,063
Yes, I can!

334
00:22:24,146 --> 00:22:26,565
Yes, I can! Yes-

335
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,068
- Quiet down, goddamn it!
- Sorry!

336
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,402
- Klump! Shut up!
- I can!

337
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:36,533
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it

338
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:40,954
I'm about to lose control
and I think I like it

339
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:43,248
I'm so excited

340
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:46,626
And I just can't hide it

341
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,710
And I know, I know
I know, I know

342
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:52,089
I know I want you

343
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:55,467
We shouldn't even think
about tomorrow

344
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,469
Still hungry?

345
00:22:57,553 --> 00:23:02,641
Sweet memories will last
a long, long time

346
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:07,103
We'll have a good time, baby
Don't you worry

347
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,105
And if we're still playin' around

348
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,608
- Boy, that's just fine
- Help.

349
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,153
Let's get excited

350
00:23:15,236 --> 00:23:17,155
- We just can't hide it
- Still hungry?

351
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:18,656
Oh, no

352
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:22,201
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know I want you

353
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,703
I want you
Oooh-hoo

354
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,296
Maybe you should try
Jenny Craig.

355
00:23:34,337 --> 00:23:37,132
Oh, I want to love you
Feel you

356
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,676
Wrap myself around you

357
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,762
- I want to squeeze you, tease you
- One hand on you!

358
00:23:42,803 --> 00:23:44,764
- I just can't get enough
- Whoo!

359
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:49,351
And if you move real slow
I'll let it go

360
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,312
I'm so excited

361
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,647
Ooh-wee, and I just can't hide it

362
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:55,691
- No, no, no, no, no
- Yeah! Yeah!

363
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:59,068
- I know, I know, I know I know, I know I want you
- Yeah!

364
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,070
I want you

365
00:24:01,154 --> 00:24:03,490
Look what you do to me

366
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,992
- Yeah!
- You got me burnin' up

367
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:09,245
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh now

368
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:12,165
Baby, I'm so excited

369
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:16,418
This is how we do it

370
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:18,879
Come on, come on, come on.
Right there.

371
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:21,090
This is how we do it

372
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:25,719
It's Friday night
and I feel all right

373
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:27,721
The party's here
on the west side

374
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:30,933
So I reached for my 40
and I turned it up-

375
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:33,018
- Oh!
- Excuse me. Hey!

376
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,061
- Professor K, how's it going?
- I'm good, David.

377
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:38,689
- What are you doin' here?
- Got a date.

378
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,192
You have a date?
Good luck, Professor.

379
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,194
Yeah, see you
next week now.

380
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:45,822
The guys and I
All the gangbangers-

381
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:48,366
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Sorry about that.

382
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,035
Oh! Oh! Excuse me.
Excuse me.

383
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,370
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

384
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:56,039
Sorry about that. Excuse me.

385
00:24:56,081 --> 00:25:00,669
Sorry about that.
Excuse me. Excuse me!

386
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,756
- Thank you.
- Wow, these are great seats, Professor.

387
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,093
Oh, yeah. Listen,
don't call me "Professor. "

388
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:11,887
Call me Sherman, all right?
Sherman.

389
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:14,598
Well, I'm glad
we did this, Sherman.

390
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,768
With a different type
of swing, you know

391
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:21,981
- Something for the honeys
- So am I.

392
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:25,109
- So am I!
- Something for the honeys

393
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,235
Here's the menu.

394
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,779
Ooh, summertime

395
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:33,074
No funner time
for me to kick it with you

396
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,076
To find something
someone-

397
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,787
- So you altered her genes?
- Yes, yes.

398
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:41,916
And if I hadn't done it, Shelley
would be in hamster heaven right now.

399
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,668
Sherman, you are
absolutely amazing.

400
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,004
We do what
we can, you know?

401
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:51,091
Got to keep on tryin'.
Got to keep on pushin'

402
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,053
Something for you
and you

403
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,474
And for you
and for you.

404
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,727
Let's go. Let's go.

405
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:05,104
- Montell Jordan!
- They were wonderful.

406
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,566
Let's keep
this show rollin'.

407
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,444
- Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen him...
- He was good.

408
00:26:11,527 --> 00:26:13,488
on Def Comedy Jam many times.

409
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:17,283
Y'all give it up for my man
Reggie Warrington! Give it up!

410
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:25,165
Watch me

411
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:29,503
Watch me
I got it, watch me

412
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:31,838
He sure is animated.

413
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:35,342
- Yeah
- What's up?

414
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:39,261
I said, "What's up?"

415
00:26:39,303 --> 00:26:44,016
- Hey!
- Women be shoppin', baby.

416
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,018
Women be shoppin'!

417
00:26:46,102 --> 00:26:48,687
You can't stop a woman
from shoppin', baby!

418
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,481
That's true.
Women do shop.

419
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:52,942
It is true.

420
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:54,944
See what we got in here tonight.
Oh, my God!

421
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:58,822
She's unbe-weave-able.
Look at this.

422
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:01,616
Look like a head full
of curly fries.

423
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:12,210
Hey, look at this white dude
right here.

424
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:16,672
"What is a weave exactly?"
Huh?

425
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:23,303
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

426
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:28,058
Baby, no! She got
more extensions than AT&T.

427
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:35,189
- Excuse me. I'm gonna go to the rest room.
- Oh, boy, I'm hot!

428
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:37,942
Sorry about that, ma'am.
Let me pick that up for ya.

429
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:41,320
Ooo-ooo-ooh!
It's a full moon tonight!

430
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:46,367
I think I found where
they hid Jimmy Hoffa!

431
00:27:46,451 --> 00:27:49,411
Excuse me.

432
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:55,083
Yeah, that's
a good one there.

433
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:58,879
You got more crack than Harlem.
Look at that!

434
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,219
Boy's so fat, every time he
turns around, it's his birthday!

435
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,473
Got to put his belt on
with a boomerang.

436
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,350
Va-va-va-va! Bang!

437
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,274
Ah, yeah. Okay, all right, now.
That's it. You got me.

438
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:25,528
- No, I ain't got ya yet. Should I get him?
- Yeah!

439
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,364
- Should I get him?
- Yeah!

440
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,742
Oh, look at this.
He's with a woman too.

441
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:32,911
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

442
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:36,289
Who is sucking
whose titties over here?

443
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:49,885
Last time this brother felt a breast,
it was in a bucket of K.F.C.

444
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,887
Extra crispy!

445
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:56,100
Every time he goes to
Sea World, they pay him!

446
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:02,980
He must be on that
new diet, Slim Slow.

447
00:29:03,064 --> 00:29:06,109
He go outside with a red shirt on, and
all the kids in the neighborhood say,

448
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,611
"Hey! Kool-Aid!"

449
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:13,491
Yeah, man, I bet I cut his fat ass open,
it'd bleed chocolate milk.

450
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:19,121
What would you do
for a Klondike bar?

451
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:23,417
Now we know what's eating
Gilbert Grape, don't we?

452
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,808
Thank you for dinner tonight, Sherman.
That was very sweet.

453
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,978
You're welcome.

454
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,817
Look, that comic tonight,
he was-

455
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:55,280
Sherman, you are
a brilliant man.

456
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:05,165
You have
a pleasant evenin'.

457
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:09,377
Good night.

458
00:30:40,281 --> 00:30:44,202
His fraternity was having
this thing called Pig Day.

459
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,369
That's the only reason
he asked me out.

460
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,707
To make fun of you?
Why do we do this to ourselves?

461
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:53,877
Every time we get depressed,
we eat and eat and eat.

462
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,046
You go to the store and buy
those little candy bars in the bag,

463
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,924
and before you know it,
the whole bag is empty.

464
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:03,053
Then at the end, you feel
just like that bag. Empty inside.

465
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:05,262
Don't you?

466
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:07,848
It's okay. It's all right.

467
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,476
Just get it all out.

468
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,271
- Say, "Yes, I can. " Say that.
- Yes, I can.

469
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:19,110
Yes, we can.

470
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:22,695
Can we go to commercial?

471
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:26,699
- I want him prepped and ready immediately.
- Yes, Doctor.

472
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:30,245
Call Dr. Matthews. I'm going to need
a lot of help on this one.

473
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:32,580
Let's move it.
You know the routine.

474
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:36,918
- Get that crash cart here stat!
- Blood pressure: 140 over 90 and rising.

475
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:39,795
- We need that I.V. rig in now!
- I.V. rig comin' in.

476
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,923
- Give me four cc's of Ambethol.
- I don't know how much more he can take.

477
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:44,925
We need the E.K.G. cart
in here now.

478
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,473
- What's the status?
- He's getting fatter. We can't stop it.

479
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:57,207
- Oh, my God!
- He's gonna explode!

480
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,063
I'm getting out of here!

481
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:01,816
Nurse!

482
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:03,443
Wait! Wait!

483
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:13,578
Aaah!

484
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:22,252
What's goin' on?

485
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:26,757
Oh, my God! Get outta here!
Get outta here!

486
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,178
Hey, everyone, run for
the hills! It's Fat-zilla!

487
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:33,304
He look like
King Kong with titties.

488
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:37,475
Sherman! I brought you some
nice fried chicken, Sherman.

489
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,437
Oh, you look fabulous!

490
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:10,339
Oh, my God!

491
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,383
He's gonna blow!

492
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:23,811
Way to go, son!
That's my boy!

493
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:29,023
No!

494
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,989
Huh?

495
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:26,578
Shelley, you've been
the guinea pig long enough.

496
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,039
It's time to see if
this stuff really works.

497
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:02,945
Aah!

498
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:11,009
Aaah! Aaah!

499
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:15,681
Oh! Oh! I'm thin!
I'm thin! Look at my cheekbones!

500
00:36:15,764 --> 00:36:18,684
I have cheekbones!
Yes! Look at my chest.

501
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:21,270
Look at my breasts.
I don't have breasts.

502
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:23,521
I'm an "A" cup.
I don't need a bra anymore.

503
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:26,065
Oh, God! I'm thin!
I'm thin!

504
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:29,861
I'm thin! I'm thin. I'm thin.
Nothin' but air there

505
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:35,116
Nothin' but air there My ass is
gone now I'm slim, slim, slim

506
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,953
Well, I'll be damned!
I can see my dick!

507
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:41,538
My dick! My dick,
my dick, my dick!

508
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:43,957
Oh, I feel good

509
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,044
- I can do stairs. I can do stairs.
- I knew that I would now

510
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:49,046
I am the stair master!

511
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:51,256
I feel good

512
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,341
I knew that I would now

513
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:55,427
You lookin' for any kind
of clothes in particular?

514
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:00,347
Spandex! AII Spandex!
Where's the Spandex section?

515
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:02,600
Oh! Spandex!
Like this!

516
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:05,728
I feel nice

517
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:09,732
- Like sugar and spice
- No titties. No titties.

518
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:13,235
No titties. Not you, me.
I'm talking about me.

519
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:17,781
My titties are gone. Your titties
are lovely. What's your name?

520
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,617
Everybody, I'm so thin.
I am thin. You ever feel thin?

521
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,579
I am thin! I am thin.
Hey, man, where's the apple pie?

522
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:32,629
When I hold you in my arms

523
00:37:32,712 --> 00:37:36,256
I know that
I can do no wrong

524
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:39,426
And when I hold you
in my arms

525
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,428
My love won't do ya
no harm

526
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,765
- Tootsie Roll! Get your tootsie! Whoo!
- And I feel nice

527
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:49,144
Like sugar and spice

528
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:52,397
So nice, so nice

529
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:55,942
I got you

530
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:02,990
I'm thin!
I'm thin!

531
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:08,579
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

532
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:13,583
- Is Professor Klump here?
- Professor Klump? Sherman, Sherman Klump.

533
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,294
Uh, no, he had to take care
of some things, Miss Purty.

534
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,463
So I'm runnin'
this thing here.

535
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:22,134
- Do I know you?
- Do you know me?

536
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,595
Sherman didn't tell you about me?

537
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,347
- No.
- Oh, man!

538
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,933
Isn't that like Sherman
to hog all the credit?

539
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,144
I'm Sherman's confidante.

540
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,146
Have you seen him today?
I was wondering...

541
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,024
if he was all right after everything
that happened at the club the other night.

542
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,153
Oh, Miss Purty,
it tore his chunky ass up.

543
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:46,448
It's strange that a man as intelligent
as Sherman has no confidence whatsoever.

544
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:48,992
Makes me sick sometimes to think-
I'm always telling the man,

545
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:52,203
"Sherman, no matter what,
you've got to strut.

546
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:54,205
You got to suck in
your gut and strut. "

547
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:57,834
- Me, personally, I don't have that problem.
- Doesn't seem like you do.

548
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:01,671
You're just too feisty and too fine.
Me and you need to hook up.

549
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:04,131
We need to go to The Scream tonight,
have a couple of drinks...

550
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,133
and strut our respective stuff
together.

551
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:08,802
I don't even know your name.

552
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:11,513
Hey, buddy, what the hell
happened here?

553
00:39:11,555 --> 00:39:14,767
See? Everybody
knows Buddy.

554
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,395
The professor must have got
a little carried away last night.

555
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:20,481
Oh! Officer Dagg,
I'm glad you came up.

556
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,523
He told me to tell you personally,
please thank your wife Claire...

557
00:39:22,565 --> 00:39:24,567
for bringing that
upside-down cake for him.

558
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,569
He ate every crumb of it.

559
00:39:26,652 --> 00:39:29,697
And can you have someone from
janitorial clean up this mess, please?

560
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,908
Thank you, Officer Dagg.
Thank you.

561
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,744
Buddy.

562
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:38,372
Buddy. Is that it,
or do you have a last name?

563
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,335
Love.

564
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:46,505
Love.

565
00:39:46,546 --> 00:39:48,882
You see, Miss Purty-

566
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:51,718
There comes a time in
a man's life when he has to-

567
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,889
Miss Purty, people have
a tendency in life-

568
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:59,934
To always want to rush into things.

569
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:02,186
What I'm trying to say...

570
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:05,606
is, uh, there's a right time
and place for everything.

571
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,443
Like I said, there's a right
time and place for everything.

572
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:11,696
Tonight would be a good time.

573
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:14,239
At The Scream would be
perfect to discuss it.

574
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:17,742
I'll see you tonight at 8:00.
Don't be late! Excuse me!

575
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,291
Whew.

576
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,544
Uh-oh.

577
00:40:42,057 --> 00:40:45,102
Good morning.
Good morning, class.

578
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:49,272
Morning, students. Good
morning! Morning. Good morning.

579
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:54,610
Uh, uh, you students just review
what we went over yesterday.

580
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,447
Professor, we weren't
here yesterday.

581
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,324
Well, then, um,
review the day before,

582
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:03,828
and tomorrow we'll do today.

583
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:07,122
That's it.

584
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:20,302
- Sherman!
- Oh, Carla. How are you?

585
00:41:20,385 --> 00:41:22,387
I've been looking for you
all morning.

586
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:25,264
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Why you lookin' for me?

587
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:27,808
I feel bad what happened
at the club the other night.

588
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,894
It was my idea
to go to The Scream.

589
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:33,814
I've forgotten about that. You forget
too. That's over. Go have a nice day.

590
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:38,235
There's something else. I met a friend
of yours in your lab. Buddy Love?

591
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,822
Buddy Love.
He's quite a character, huh?

592
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:45,325
He asked me out,
and he said it was your idea.

593
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:48,578
Oh, did he?
Well, uh, I know you're new in town.

594
00:41:48,661 --> 00:41:51,748
I thought it would be nice for a new
girl to get out, meet some people.

595
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:54,584
- Did you find him attractive?
- Honestly, yes.

596
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:58,838
He's very handsome and athletic, but I don't
feel comfortable talking to you about that.

597
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:02,674
You can talk to me about anything.
I want you to.

598
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:05,177
And I think you should definitely
go out with Buddy Love.

599
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,844
You do?

600
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,802
Absolutely. I don't think
there's anything wrong...

601
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:11,100
with two young people getting together
and having a good time.

602
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,185
So by all means,
do just that.

603
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:16,647
- You sure you're all right with that?
- Don't worry about me.

604
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:21,401
I'm just fine. In fact, I'll put in
a good word with you for Buddy.

605
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:25,071
Oh, my goodness. I'm so late.
Excuse me. I'll talk to Buddy.

606
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:29,617
You make it hard, long
soft, short

607
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:32,537
And be strokin'

608
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:35,540
I be strokin'

609
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:42,212
I strokin' through the east
and I'm strokin' through-

610
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:49,761
Hey, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

611
00:42:55,266 --> 00:42:57,560
Now you be careful.
If there's a scratch in the car,

612
00:42:57,601 --> 00:42:59,562
there's a scratch
in your ass.

613
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:03,274
You are too fine to be givin' me
curbside service.

614
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:06,152
- I'm not. I'm leaving.
- We just got here.

615
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:09,071
No, you just got here. I've been
waiting for you for almost an hour.

616
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:12,991
They say anticipation
helps make the appetite grow stronger.

617
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:15,368
- Anticipate a night alone.
- Hey, hey.

618
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,038
Let's just have a meal together.
Why you leavin'? You want me to beg?

619
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,248
I'll get down on my knees. I'll beg you
in front of all these people.

620
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,250
Think I care if these people
are watchin'?

621
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:27,213
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I want
the world to know that I was late!

622
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:30,132
And I'm sorry!
My car ran outta gas.

623
00:43:30,215 --> 00:43:33,969
I needed fresh drawers.
My mother's sick. The car broke down.

624
00:43:34,053 --> 00:43:37,264
- Buddy, get up.
- Hear me out. I am sorry!

625
00:43:37,306 --> 00:43:39,391
I don't know why
this is happenin' tonight.

626
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:42,728
Of all nights this has
got to happen to me tonight.

627
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,314
- Okay.
- Why? Why!

628
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:50,943
- Okay!
- Why?

629
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:53,654
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay. Good. Let's eat.

630
00:43:53,738 --> 00:43:57,617
I am so hungry. Hey, don't let the
tears fool ya. I'm a tooth chipper.

631
00:43:59,535 --> 00:44:03,581
Six T-bones, five baked potatoes
and two servings of creamed spinach.

632
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:07,626
I have never seen anyone eat so much.
You are so lucky to stay so thin.

633
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,628
Luck has nothin'
to do with it.

634
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:11,671
It's a matter of recombinant
ribonucleic acids

635
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:13,571
unzipped by a radioactive guanine peptide.

636
00:44:14,115 --> 00:44:15,873
Then, Then what does that mean?

637
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:17,884
I don't know. I'm trying to
sound extra intelligent.

638
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,976
Got ya!
You gonna eat that?

639
00:44:19,976 --> 00:44:22,098
Alright. Guess who's
back in the house.

640
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:27,520
From Def Comedy Jam, my man,
Reggie Warrington. Give it up!

641
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:34,402
I hate this guy. I hate this guy.
He is so obnoxious.

642
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:37,154
Give the nigger a chance.

643
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,448
Watch me

644
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,326
It's your world, dog! I'm just
a squirrel tryin' to get a nut.

645
00:44:43,368 --> 00:44:46,788
I've got somethin'
that makes me wanna shout

646
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,499
- What's up?
- What's up, nigger?

647
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:53,878
- I said, "What's up?"
- Didn't you hear me when I say, "Hey"?

648
00:44:55,797 --> 00:45:00,175
Boy, women be shoppin'.
Women be shoppin'.

649
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,052
You cannot stop
a woman from shoppin'.

650
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:05,848
Let's see what I got
in the house tonight.

651
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:10,352
Oh, now, look at
this white guy right here.

652
00:45:10,436 --> 00:45:14,023
You cannot tell me
he ain't got a small jammie.

653
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:16,816
Man, it's so small he needs
tweezers to take a piss.

654
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:20,403
He needs tweezers
to take a piss!

655
00:45:20,486 --> 00:45:23,406
Tweezers on his dick!

656
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:26,242
Reggie's hot tonight. Uh-oh.

657
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:30,747
Look at this. Look at this.

658
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,498
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I can't breathe!

659
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,543
- Excuse me, brother.
- I can't breathe!

660
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:39,046
- Okay.
- Brother, man!

661
00:45:42,883 --> 00:45:45,260
You almost killed me, man!

662
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:48,847
I had to give myself
the Heimlich.

663
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:51,682
You mind waitin' for
the punch line first, brother?

664
00:45:51,724 --> 00:45:53,517
I'm sorry.
You're so funny.

665
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,271
You're so funny the way you take a person's
personal defects and flip it around.

666
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:59,273
Like you pick somebody in the
room and say, "Look at your foot,"

667
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,275
and everybody look at it
and start laughin'.

668
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,778
That's funny shit.
You're on your way!

669
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:08,074
You goin' to the top!
You're the next Lenny Bruce!

670
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:11,242
- Why, thank you. Thank you very much.
- That's genius.

671
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:14,079
That'd even work with me
doin' it to you.

672
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:17,540
If I say, look at Reggie's gums and teeth.
His mother had an affair with Mr. Ed.

673
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:21,211
See? Everybody's laughin'.

674
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:26,423
They can visualize your mother
in a barn with Mr. Ed.

675
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:32,262
Look what I'm doin', Wilbur.
Look at me!

676
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:37,434
You snappin' on me?
Are you snappin' on Reggie?

677
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:39,436
It's your teeth, Reggie.

678
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:43,399
I don't know whether to smile at you
or kick a field goal.

679
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,775
Hey, Reggie! It's good!

680
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,319
It's all good!

681
00:46:48,403 --> 00:46:51,239
And, man, what's wrong with that
breath? I can smell it over here.

682
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,409
Reggie, your breath is so stink,
people look forward to your farts.

683
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,121
Breath smell like shit.
Do you smell shit?

684
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:00,999
I smell shit.

685
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:06,837
Oh! Oh!
You done did it now, boy.

686
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,173
I wasn't gonna say nothin'
'cause I like black people.

687
00:47:10,257 --> 00:47:15,095
But it's time to attack black.
That's right. The gloves coming off.

688
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:16,471
Don't hurt me now!

689
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:18,932
Maybe it's time for Reggie
to lay into your mama.

690
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:22,309
- Whoo!
- Oh! Oh, yeah!

691
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:26,355
Maybe it's time for Reggie to
talk about your mama a little bit.

692
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:30,985
- You're the man, Reggie!
- Your mother's so fat,

693
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:35,531
she went to Sizzler's,
and the bitch got a group discount.

694
00:47:35,614 --> 00:47:37,991
Uh!

695
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:41,661
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

696
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,793
Aah! Ha! Ha!

697
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:52,922
Uh-uh!

698
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:56,216
Okay, fat jokes!

699
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,553
You want to do fat jokes?
All right.

700
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:01,555
Your mother's so fat,

701
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:04,808
the bitch need a Thomas Guide
to find her asshole!

702
00:48:07,186 --> 00:48:09,730
All right! Wait, wait,
wait. Your mother's so fat,

703
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:13,524
after sex I rolled over twice,
and I'm still on the bitch!

704
00:48:13,566 --> 00:48:16,069
Your mother is so fat,

705
00:48:16,152 --> 00:48:18,404
she fell in the Grand Canyon
and got stuck!

706
00:48:18,488 --> 00:48:23,576
Reggie's mama's so fat that the bitch
gets her toenails painted at Earl Scheib!

707
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,828
Earl Scheib!

708
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,956
Earl Scheib!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

709
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,667
Hey, hey, get off the stage, man.
You ain't in show business.

710
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,711
Reggie's mama
is so fat,

711
00:48:34,753 --> 00:48:36,713
her blood type
is Rocky Road!

712
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,840
Isn't that somethin'?

713
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:43,095
Reggie's mother is so fat,
her belt size is equator!

714
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,890
Get it? Equator?

715
00:48:51,102 --> 00:48:53,729
Let's get a big round of applause
for Reggie's mama's ass...

716
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:56,273
that brought us
so much joy tonight.

717
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:58,192
Yeah!
That's a big ass.

718
00:48:58,234 --> 00:49:01,362
Enough! Silence!

719
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:04,073
I can't take this shit
no more.

720
00:49:04,156 --> 00:49:06,449
Now, you done talked
about me enough, boy!

721
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:11,663
I tried to be peaceful, but now it's
time for Reggie to "karatasize" your ass!

722
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:14,416
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah.

723
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:20,630
Oh, Reggie, I heard of dreadlocks,
but "shitlocks"?

724
00:49:20,714 --> 00:49:23,757
That's not your hair.

725
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:28,053
Take that pile of shit off your head.
You go too far with the comedy.

726
00:49:28,095 --> 00:49:30,159
Oh, oh- I- I-
Come on! Come on!

727
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:30,918
What's that?

728
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:33,095
Oh, yeah, it's my style, boy.
You didn't know Reggie studied.

729
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,765
- What style is that?
- This is called "Kick-Your-Ass Style," boy.

730
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,196
- Oh, shit.
- Reggie done studied on

731
00:49:37,196 --> 00:49:39,032
the streets. Oh! Come on!

732
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:41,816
Oh! Oh! Aaah!

733
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:48,281
Oh, you quick, but I'm quicker.

734
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:50,283
- Watch my feet.
- Come on with it!

735
00:49:50,366 --> 00:49:53,244
I'm gonna come on with it.
I'm gonna... Ha! Hey! Aaah!

736
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:56,789
- Oh, damn!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

737
00:49:56,873 --> 00:50:01,960
me and Reggie want to send one out to a
very special lady in the house tonight.

738
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:06,673
Lovin' you is easy
'cause you're beautiful

739
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:12,804
Do-un-do-un-doo-doo
Reggie?

740
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:16,807
Let go.

741
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:18,976
That was pretty.

742
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:22,855
Ladies and gentlemen, Reggie has left
the building. Thank you, and good night.

743
00:50:29,028 --> 00:50:32,823
Oh, stop it! Stop it! Now,
thank you so much. Thank you.

744
00:50:32,865 --> 00:50:35,033
Thank you so
- Oh, please, please, come on now.

745
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,578
Hey, who pinched my ass? Cut it
out. Ha-ha-ha-ha! That's good.

746
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:41,831
All right. Thank you. Can you get the
bill for me? Thanks, man. Too much!

747
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,702
That was amazing.
I can't believe you did that.

748
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:46,871
Well believe it, because
"Amazing" is my middle name.

749
00:50:46,871 --> 00:50:49,881
I only wish Professor Klump
was here to have seen it.

750
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,883
Listen.

751
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,344
This is our moment. I don't wanna
ruin it with talks of Sherman.

752
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,389
You know, your eyes,
there's something...

753
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,016
very familiar about them,

754
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,185
as if I already know you.

755
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:07,982
You know, I feel the exact same way
about you, Miss Purty.

756
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:21,411
Mmm. Miss Purty,
let me tell you.

757
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:25,748
That kiss was probably the most
wonderful kiss I've ever-

758
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:29,501
What I meant to say was that, uh-

759
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:31,378
- Your lip.
- What?

760
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,547
- Your lip is swollen.
- My lip?

761
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:36,216
- Yes.
- Oh, my lip! Oh.

762
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:38,885
That happens every time I-
What kind of lipstick do you have on?

763
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:39,753
Chanel.

764
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:42,314
That happens every time I
have Chanel lipstick on my lips.

765
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:46,767
An allergic reaction.
Oh. It's giving me gas too.

766
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,061
You have to go catch a cab.

767
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:51,564
I gotta go to the drugstore
and get some Benadryl and Kaopectate.

768
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:52,851
Excuse me. Have a
pleasant evening. Bye-bye!

769
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:54,170
Buddy! Buddy, wait!

770
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:57,945
Oh, man.

771
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:00,406
- Hey, Professor Klump is here?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:03,241
- Where is he?
- Uh, there he is, right there.

773
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:06,244
- That guy gave you this credit card?
- Yup.

774
00:52:06,328 --> 00:52:08,496
That's not Professor Klump.

775
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,041
- That's not his credit card. Hey!
- What?

776
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,254
Hey! Hey!

777
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:20,258
Okay, fella, what are you doing
with the professor's credit card?

778
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,219
Where'd you get it? I'm sorry. Perhaps
you need the money more than I thought.

779
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:26,555
Aaah!

780
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:35,314
Oh, my God!

781
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:47,075
Oh, my God!
That's a bus!

782
00:52:47,116 --> 00:52:51,120
You're gonna kill us, man!
What the hell is the matter-

783
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:54,415
Oh, man! This is
Freddy Krueger shit, man!

784
00:52:54,457 --> 00:52:56,583
Professor?

785
00:52:58,835 --> 00:53:00,796
Hello, Jason.

786
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:05,467
What's happening?

787
00:53:16,477 --> 00:53:20,106
First time we had to use one of these
without an accident.

788
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:42,293
The class left
20 minutes ago.

789
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:45,046
Dean Richmond!
Oh, hello, sir.

790
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:48,049
You caught me in the middle
of an experiment I was doing.

791
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:52,428
I was trying to see how the students would
respond to a teacher-less environment.

792
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,597
Teacher-less environment.
New field of research for you?

793
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:58,100
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Interesting. Always thinking.

794
00:53:58,183 --> 00:54:02,479
That's good, Klump. Let me know your
results. Would you mind explaining this?

795
00:54:04,148 --> 00:54:07,984
Oh! Yeah, well, um,
my car's in the shop, so-

796
00:54:08,026 --> 00:54:12,363
So you put a $47,000 luxury car
on your faculty account.

797
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:16,826
Initially, I- I requested a Yugo,
and this is all they had.

798
00:54:16,868 --> 00:54:18,828
If it's all they had,
it's all they had.

799
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,582
After all, men like us
can't walk around now, can we? Hmm?

800
00:54:22,665 --> 00:54:24,584
Come on.

801
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,880
Oh, well, well. I'm glad
you're takin' it like that, sir.

802
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:32,758
I thought you was gonna get
angry and start screamin'...

803
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:35,218
and hollerin',
and maybe even fire me.

804
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,304
Whoo!

805
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:41,308
Oh, Sherman, Sherman. In the end
we know so little of each other, hmm?

806
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:43,517
No, my friend, I've got
bigger fish to fry.

807
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,686
I spoke to Harlan Hartley.

808
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:48,898
He's offering that tiny trinket that
could save your entire research program.

809
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,588
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.
- I set up a meeting with him.

810
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:53,641
He wants to hear your
grant proposal personally

811
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:56,137
Friday, the Ritz, dinner, 8:00 sharp.

812
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:59,440
Well, sir, I think that's
a wonderful idea, sir. Absolutely.

813
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,729
And I promise you, I will not let you down.

814
00:55:01,729 --> 00:55:03,442
You won't.
I know you won't.

815
00:55:03,442 --> 00:55:05,997
I know you're going to be there,
and you're going to be great.

816
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:08,792
In fact, I know you're
going to be perfect.

817
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,960
- Do you know how I know all these things?
- How's that?

818
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,954
I know them, because if
you're not perfect, never

819
00:55:13,954 --> 00:55:15,317
mind the yelling and the
screaming and the firing.

820
00:55:15,317 --> 00:55:18,051
If anything goes wrong
for any reason,

821
00:55:18,093 --> 00:55:20,594
I'm going to kill you.

822
00:55:20,636 --> 00:55:23,973
I don't mean that as a euphemism.
I'm going to literally kill you.

823
00:55:24,056 --> 00:55:28,435
I'm going to strangle you
and choke off your air supply...

824
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:30,604
until you pass away.

825
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:34,650
Ooh, okay.

826
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:37,652
'Til Friday, then.

827
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:40,488
It's a date.

828
00:55:47,036 --> 00:55:49,163
Sir, this is incredible.

829
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:52,166
It's, it's a complete metabolic
transformation. How did it happen?

830
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:56,336
- Was it an accident?
- No, I did it to myself, Jason.

831
00:55:56,378 --> 00:55:58,338
You did? Why?

832
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,843
If it was for the grant, the data
with Shelley was already so compelling.

833
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:06,388
Well, I have compelling
reasons of my own, Jason.

834
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,683
I have a case of infatuation
of sorts with Miss Purty.

835
00:56:09,725 --> 00:56:13,602
Professor, if you feel this way
about Carla, why don't you tell her?

836
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:16,105
It'd be a lot simpler
than transforming into-

837
00:56:16,188 --> 00:56:18,983
This guy's testosterone levels
are right off the charts.

838
00:56:19,066 --> 00:56:21,861
He was mean last night.
It was so unlike you.

839
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:25,197
- You know, I did feel that.
- Sir, you can't control him.

840
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:28,951
Jason, you have no idea
what it feels like to be Buddy Love.

841
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:31,703
It's indescribable.
It's just wonderful!

842
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:35,206
The way people talk to him and
treat him, and the way she looks at him.

843
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:38,084
But he's dangerous.
He almost killed us last night.

844
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:41,755
We should be concentrating on getting
the grant proposal to Harlan Hartley.

845
00:56:41,796 --> 00:56:43,757
This is nuts!

846
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:49,928
I guess you're right, Jason.
I never have behaved like this before.

847
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:55,768
But on the other hand,

848
00:56:55,809 --> 00:56:58,896
I've never been in love before.

849
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,898
Ever.

850
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:22,377
- Afternoon, Carla.
- Hi, Sherman.

851
00:57:22,459 --> 00:57:25,295
- How are you doing today?
- Pretty good.

852
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:28,173
I come over to see how things
were going with you and Buddy.

853
00:57:28,256 --> 00:57:30,175
I wish I knew.

854
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:33,971
We went out last night. It was great.
We had such a wonderful time.

855
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:36,640
And then all of a sudden
he runs out of the club.

856
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:38,642
He has some allergic reaction.

857
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:41,310
- I don't even know if he's all right.
- He's fine.

858
00:57:41,394 --> 00:57:44,647
He told me that his lip swelled up, he
put ice on it and the swelling came down.

859
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:48,401
- Kinda strange, huh?
- Well, did he even ask about me?

860
00:57:48,484 --> 00:57:51,862
Did he say why he didn't call me
and let me know he was all right?

861
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:53,864
Carla, Buddy's kind of unreliable.

862
00:57:53,948 --> 00:57:57,493
He's kind of what you call a "here
today, gone tomorrow" kind of fellow.

863
00:57:57,576 --> 00:57:59,494
- Oh, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

864
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:03,415
So he had you talk to me
because he's not interested anymore.

865
00:58:03,498 --> 00:58:05,667
- No, it's nothing quite like that.
- Look.

866
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,920
I know what it feels like
to be brushed off, and it's okay.

867
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:13,300
This is all my fault. I should've never
encouraged you to go out with Buddy.

868
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:16,677
Sherman, you have been so sweet.

869
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,723
I'll just have to forget about him.
I'll see you later.

870
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:23,809
Carla.

871
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:26,395
I was wonderin' if, uh,

872
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:29,356
I could talk to you
about you and I for a second.

873
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,358
I was-

874
00:58:33,027 --> 00:58:36,070
I was wonderin' what
you were doin' later, 'cause...

875
00:58:36,154 --> 00:58:38,197
the family gonna get together.

876
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:40,366
She made a meal and...

877
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:44,495
we gonna be eatin', so I figured if you
not doin' anything for dinner,

878
00:58:44,537 --> 00:58:49,208
we'd love to have you,
if you want to come over for dinner.

879
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,543
We'd love to have you
over for dinner.

880
00:58:52,544 --> 00:58:54,504
I'd love to.

881
00:58:54,546 --> 00:58:57,049
- Would you, now?
- Yes, I would.

882
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:59,259
Should we call and make sure there's
going to be enough food?

883
00:58:59,343 --> 00:59:02,721
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

884
00:59:03,096 --> 00:59:06,058
There's nothing
like being with family!

885
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,518
I am hungry. Come on now.

886
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,604
- Carla, where are you from?
- Chicago.

887
00:59:11,687 --> 00:59:14,398
- Oh, Chicago! We have family there.
- Windy City, huh?

888
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:18,778
I was workin' on a skyscraper in Chicago
once and my lunch blew off the 27th floor.

889
00:59:18,861 --> 00:59:24,116
Yeah, I figure your fat ass would remember
somebody's sandwich flyin' off a building.

890
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,576
Oh, baby, eat some bread.

891
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,954
Miss Purty, are you and Sherman
havin' relations?

892
00:59:29,037 --> 00:59:32,290
- That's a good question.
- Uh, no, Grandma.

893
00:59:32,374 --> 00:59:34,626
It's not like- like that.
We're colleagues.

894
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:36,753
- Oh.
- We just work together.

895
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:38,755
That's how it start out- colleagues.

896
00:59:38,838 --> 00:59:40,757
Me and your grandfather
was colleagues.

897
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,760
Next thing you know he's on top of me
in the shed, pumpin' and a-sweatin'.

898
00:59:43,843 --> 00:59:46,095
- It's not like that.
- Will you hush up?

899
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:48,973
You never brought a girl home. The
least you can do is let us talk to her.

900
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:51,725
Yeah, I'd like to get to know her
a little better myself.

901
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:54,561
Ain't nothing wrong with havin'
relations. Don't be ashamed of that.

902
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:58,399
Relations is beautiful. When I was young
I used to always have relations.

903
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,111
Every night, if a nice gentleman
bring me flowers and candy,

904
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:06,948
take me to a movie,
show me a lovely evenin',

905
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:11,119
then I would take him home
and give him hot, lovely relations.

906
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,122
Relations is a beautiful thing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

907
01:00:14,163 --> 01:00:16,457
Especially two young people.

908
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:19,252
- That blowhole.
- Cletus!

909
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:21,450
Sometimes when I'm
alone, I relate to myself.

910
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,353
I can relate.

911
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,940
Oh, Mama.

912
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,015
I don't wanna hear this
shit while I'm eatin'.

913
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:29,678
- Cletus!
- I'm gonna kill you later.

914
01:00:29,761 --> 01:00:32,431
- Carla, do you like children?
- Yes. Oh, that's wonderful.

915
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:35,434
I can't wait for Sherman
to bring me home some grandbabies.

916
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:39,312
I know you're gonna enjoy making them
babies. Got those childbearing hips.

917
01:00:39,395 --> 01:00:41,981
Baby'll pop right out.

918
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:44,817
Your family got any money?
I ain't payin' for no big-ass wedding.

919
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,029
I know a wonderful minister.
What religious background are you?

920
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:52,158
I still got my wedding dress.
If you want it, I'll take it in.

921
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:55,619
You'd look so lovely in it.
It's white, though.

922
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,246
Can you wear a white wedding dress,
young lady?

923
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:02,500
Now, Sherman,
you can wear a white tuxedo.

924
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:06,171
'Cause you know Sherman- Sherman
has never had relations.

925
01:01:06,212 --> 01:01:08,340
Mama, you gonna
embarrass my baby.

926
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:10,925
- I hope you got a strong back.
- Oh, look at my baby blushin'.

927
01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:14,762
When you get all that man, and release
all that that's been built up...

928
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:17,514
for 35 years-

929
01:01:17,598 --> 01:01:20,976
Just wantin' and wantin'
and wantin'!

930
01:01:21,018 --> 01:01:23,520
Whoo! Might make
your head blow off.

931
01:01:23,604 --> 01:01:26,023
Pop goes the weasel!

932
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:28,359
I got my own self hot
tellin' that story.

933
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,027
Pop goes the weasel,
'cause the weasel say "pop"!

934
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:33,029
You gonna get married
here or in Chicago?

935
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:35,865
Do you cook? 'Cause somebody's
got to feed my Sherman.

936
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:38,868
Yeah, I know a wonderful church
down there on Main Street,

937
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,870
but they won't marry you
if you're a lesbian.

938
01:01:40,912 --> 01:01:44,415
Not that I have anything
against lesbians. I love lesbians.

939
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:48,002
- Lesbians is cool.
- There's nothing wrong with a little bingo.

940
01:01:48,044 --> 01:01:50,003
A little cunnilingus
ain't never hurt nobody.

941
01:01:50,045 --> 01:01:53,340
- Why is it the woman always gets the choice where they're gonna be married?
- Tradition.

942
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:57,260
Tradition, my ass! I ain't gonna pay
for everybody flyin' to no Chicago!

943
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:59,680
- You know how much plane tickets cost?
- You cheap bastard.

944
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,848
We're gonna have to
drive down there.

945
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,142
I'm not driving over to Chicago.

946
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:09,021
Sherman gonna have relations

947
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:12,858
My baby's not gettin' married

948
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,862
There you go again, poppin' off gas
in front of this lovely young lady.

949
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:19,073
We're trying to have a meal.
Put that brake on this gas.

950
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:22,743
I hope your ass
turn into a frog.

951
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:25,287
Don't nobody want to hear
your flatulence, Cletus Klump.

952
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,247
You're such a disgrace!

953
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,250
- I stopped holding my gas a long time ago.
- You spoiled the dinner!

954
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:32,794
Say one more word

955
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:37,882
Listen, Carla,

956
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:40,385
I want to apologize
about my family back there.

957
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:42,118
I think they got the wrong
idea about things.

958
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:45,061
Oh, no no. I should be
the one to apologize.

959
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,558
I'm so sorry if I seemed
distant tonight,

960
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,352
but I still have Buddy on my mind.

961
01:02:50,436 --> 01:02:53,689
- You really care for Buddy, huh?
- I don't know.

962
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:58,360
I mean, on the outside,
he seems so cocky and brash.

963
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:02,113
But when I look in his eyes,
I see kindness, I see warmth.

964
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:04,866
And that's the side of Buddy
I wanted to get to know.

965
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:07,702
I just got way
ahead of myself.

966
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:11,539
And here I am, talking your ear off
once again about Buddy.

967
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:13,625
No, it's quite all right, really.

968
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,627
Listen, Carla,

969
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,337
don't you worry about Buddy.

970
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,339
I'll find him for you.

971
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,967
Thank you, Sherman.

972
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:26,970
Thank you for being
such a good friend to me.

973
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,015
A good friend.

974
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:40,816
Good night.

975
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:08,343
Professor?

976
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:10,511
Is that you?

977
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:13,847
I just finished
the grant proposal.

978
01:04:17,268 --> 01:04:20,354
What's the matter with you? Never seen
a brother wearing a circus tent before?

979
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:24,066
- Black man can't go campin'?
- Now, wait a minute. You. You can't be you.

980
01:04:24,149 --> 01:04:26,068
We agreed that
you wouldn't do this.

981
01:04:26,151 --> 01:04:28,528
Someone has to tend
to chunky butt's sex life.

982
01:04:28,611 --> 01:04:31,364
Chunky butt is extremely horny.
Excuse me.

983
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:35,410
But Professor Klump has a meeting
tonight with Harlan Hartley at the Ritz.

984
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:38,705
I'm gonna be at the Ritz tonight, but it
will not be in the interest of science.

985
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:41,291
No! I can't let you go.

986
01:04:41,374 --> 01:04:43,376
Professor!

987
01:04:43,459 --> 01:04:47,546
If you're in there
and you can hear me, come out!

988
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:52,009
Professor, listen to me. The
testosterone levels are way too high.

989
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,053
You can't control him.

990
01:04:59,224 --> 01:05:02,102
- Oh! Jason!
- What?

991
01:05:02,185 --> 01:05:06,230
It's me, Sherman. I'm talking to you
from deep down inside Buddy Love.

992
01:05:06,314 --> 01:05:09,851
Listen to me closely. Go in
the back room while I'm holding him,

993
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:12,137
and get the coagulant serum
off the back shelf!

994
01:05:12,137 --> 01:05:12,844
In the storage closet?

995
01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:15,531
- Yes, Jason! Hurry, Jason!
- I got it!

996
01:05:15,573 --> 01:05:18,200
- We don't have much time. Let's move!
- I got it!

997
01:05:20,578 --> 01:05:22,871
Professor!
Professor!

998
01:05:22,912 --> 01:05:26,041
I have an appointment with love!
Good night, hamster boy!

999
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:28,585
No, Professor!

1000
01:05:50,064 --> 01:05:53,400
"Sorry I haven't phoned,
but I haven't been myself lately.

1001
01:05:53,442 --> 01:05:55,986
"Join me for dinner. Buddy Love.

1002
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:00,615
P.S. I've enclosed a wallet-sized photo
for your enjoyment. "

1003
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:12,085
Buddy, how can I stay mad at you?
This is gorgeous!

1004
01:06:12,126 --> 01:06:15,087
You're gorgeous and I'm gorgeous, so we
should be in gorgeous surroundings.

1005
01:06:15,128 --> 01:06:17,297
- Let me get the room key.
- Wait. Hold it.

1006
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:19,800
I didn't say anything
about going to any room with you.

1007
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:22,469
You said you were
taking me to dinner.

1008
01:06:22,552 --> 01:06:25,305
What are you talking about?
Oh, you think that- Oh!

1009
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,307
Oh, my- Hey, hey, hey.
Slow down.

1010
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:30,018
I just want to spend
some time with you, by ourselves.

1011
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:34,146
I don't want to share you with these
people. I want to eat, alone, quiet.

1012
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:38,150
I would never disrespect you.
I'm a puppy dog.

1013
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:41,153
Please, can I go
get this room?

1014
01:06:43,197 --> 01:06:45,825
- Yes?
- Yes.

1015
01:06:45,908 --> 01:06:49,328
I'd throw him in the river with a Buick tied
to his neck. He'd probably drag the car down.

1016
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,329
- Miss Purty. Purty!
- Dean Richmond.

1017
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:53,873
Have you seen Professor Klump?
He's 40 minutes late.

1018
01:06:53,957 --> 01:06:56,710
If Harlan Hartley walks out that door,
$10 million goes with him.

1019
01:06:56,793 --> 01:06:59,671
Oh, Lord. I'm gonna have to lay down
in front of his car.

1020
01:06:59,713 --> 01:07:02,173
- Let's go.
- Buddy, you know Sherman's research.

1021
01:07:02,215 --> 01:07:04,718
He's late for a meeting.
Fill in for him.

1022
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:08,012
No, it's a nice thought, but he'd
have to know Sherman's research.

1023
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:10,180
You know Sherman's research?
Who are you?

1024
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:13,809
You might say I'm a visiting professor
who might be staying for a while.

1025
01:07:13,851 --> 01:07:16,257
I do know Sherman's work.
In fact, I am Sherman's work.

1026
01:07:16,257 --> 01:07:17,241
Buddy!

1027
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:20,190
Do you think you can do Klump's job
and crowbar that dough out of Hartley?

1028
01:07:20,274 --> 01:07:23,694
Hey man, there's not a job on this planet
I can't do twice as good as Sherman.

1029
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:26,738
Good. Follow me.

1030
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:29,365
I'll go do this just 'cause
you asked me, not 'cause of him.

1031
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,492
You just stay put.

1032
01:07:31,534 --> 01:07:34,662
I've got to go be brilliant.
Look at your fine self.

1033
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:38,541
I bet you have on
a thong made of licorice, don't you?

1034
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,376
Excuse me.

1035
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:43,962
All righty!

1036
01:07:44,046 --> 01:07:46,381
Well, this had better be
Professor Klump.

1037
01:07:46,423 --> 01:07:49,051
Klump? That fraud,
that hack, that no-talent.

1038
01:07:49,092 --> 01:07:51,970
No, sir, this is the man
behind Klump's work, the real genius.

1039
01:07:52,054 --> 01:07:53,972
I give you
Professor Buddy Love.

1040
01:07:54,056 --> 01:07:57,935
All right, Professor Love. You have
one minute to show me your research.

1041
01:07:58,018 --> 01:08:02,021
No, you got it backwards, Rockefeller.
You have one minute to listen.

1042
01:08:02,063 --> 01:08:04,231
May I borrow this?
You haven't used it, have you?

1043
01:08:04,315 --> 01:08:07,401
Don't want to get your boogers
on my fingers. Okay. Here we go.

1044
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:09,737
25N times C.

1045
01:08:09,779 --> 01:08:13,324
You have to excuse my handwriting.
I'm in a bit of a rush.

1046
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:16,744
- You have a pleasant evening. Good night.
- Uh, Professor Love,

1047
01:08:16,827 --> 01:08:20,997
don't you think Mr. Hartley would like
to know what that means in lay terms?

1048
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:24,334
Oh, you mean rich-dummy terms?

1049
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:28,255
I'll break it down for the rich dummies
in the room. Listen up.

1050
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,257
If you eat nasty stuff
like this-

1051
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:33,260
I know it looks good,
and some of y'all like pork chops,

1052
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:38,138
but this greasy, nasty pork chop-
there's a gene in your D.N.A...

1053
01:08:38,222 --> 01:08:42,268
that routes this straight to your fat
cells, and it causes unsightly conditions.

1054
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:51,277
The arm is taking on a gelatin
sort of vibe. It's quite nasty.

1055
01:08:51,318 --> 01:08:53,946
To my left, this gentleman
has turkey neck.

1056
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,656
To my immediate left, this woman is
suffering from what we like to call...

1057
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:58,658
"saddlebag syndrome. "

1058
01:08:58,741 --> 01:09:01,395
To my extreme left, this young lady is

1059
01:09:01,395 --> 01:09:03,637
suffering from what I
like to call "tank ass".

1060
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:04,535
Tank ass?

1061
01:09:04,535 --> 01:09:07,334
Please, sit down. Not tonight. I'm
your brother! I'm your brother.

1062
01:09:07,334 --> 01:09:10,336
Like I was saying, everybody,
where there's a will, there's a way.

1063
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,213
and there is a way we can
turn these genes off.

1064
01:09:13,297 --> 01:09:16,133
I'm not talking about
using exercise or diet.

1065
01:09:16,174 --> 01:09:18,760
I'm talking about
by taking a simple solution...

1066
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:22,264
that helps reconstruct
your metabolic cellular strands,

1067
01:09:22,306 --> 01:09:26,977
thus giving you the appearance
of, in medical terms, gluteus minimus.

1068
01:09:27,019 --> 01:09:30,313
Or, in layman's terms,
an extremely tight, wonderful ass.

1069
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:32,815
Let's give a big round of applause
for the woman with the nice ass.

1070
01:09:32,857 --> 01:09:35,943
Her ass is so nice, don't you agree?
She's worked so hard.

1071
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:39,280
Have a seat.
Oh, are these girls with you?

1072
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:41,782
Everyone has a nice ass
at this table.

1073
01:09:41,824 --> 01:09:44,243
Is this the nice-ass section?

1074
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:47,329
- Where'd you find this man?
- Harlan, it's an outrage.

1075
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,081
I assure you he has no affiliation
with this school.

1076
01:09:50,165 --> 01:09:52,375
- He's brilliant.
- Exactly my point.

1077
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:56,212
It's an outrage that his brilliance
has no affiliation with this school.

1078
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:58,757
That's why I found him
and brought him to your money.

1079
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,593
Attention.
Brought him to your attention.

1080
01:10:05,346 --> 01:10:07,821
My goodness, it is time
to take my medication.

1081
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:08,737
- Professor!

1082
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,894
Hartley loved you. He's going to be
at the Alumni Ball tomorrow night.

1083
01:10:11,977 --> 01:10:14,563
If you can prove the formula works,
the ten million is ours!

1084
01:10:14,647 --> 01:10:18,734
What makes you so sure that the money
is ours, instead of just being mine?

1085
01:10:18,817 --> 01:10:21,528
You're good, Love. Very good.

1086
01:10:21,612 --> 01:10:26,157
How'd you like to fill in for Professor
Klump on a more permanent basis?

1087
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:28,076
That's what I had in mind.

1088
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,538
- He talked to me first.
- Hey, I'm the one with the gluteus minimus.

1089
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:35,625
Will you guys just chill?
He said he could handle all three of us.

1090
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,044
With a name like Buddy Love,
I bet he can.

1091
01:10:40,129 --> 01:10:43,423
Carla, are you ready to go upstairs?

1092
01:10:45,425 --> 01:10:47,386
I guess not.

1093
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:49,805
Hey, wha- Where ya goin'?
What's your problem?

1094
01:10:49,888 --> 01:10:52,933
They're my problem, and you can handle
all three of them, huh?

1095
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:56,103
Oh, well, I thought after dinner you
might want to have a little group activity.

1096
01:10:56,186 --> 01:10:59,230
After all, Buddy does have
a lot of love to give.

1097
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:02,817
Oh, you are one sick,
twisted freak!

1098
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,152
Oh, come on, Carla.
What's the- Hey!

1099
01:11:05,236 --> 01:11:09,740
Go on, leave!
There's more titties over here anyway!

1100
01:11:09,824 --> 01:11:11,909
Think I want them two titties.
I have six titties.

1101
01:11:11,993 --> 01:11:14,745
I had two titties.
Now I have six. That's multiplication.

1102
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:20,667
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

1103
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:23,837
- Boys will be boys
- Whoo! Yeah!

1104
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,007
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

1105
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:29,968
Oh, yeah! This is what I call
burnin' calories!

1106
01:11:30,051 --> 01:11:31,970
Come on! Help me
burn this stuff up!

1107
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:36,765
Yeah! Hey, this is goin'
down to Mr. Wilson downstairs!

1108
01:11:36,807 --> 01:11:44,273
The roof, the roof,
the roof is on fire!

1109
01:11:56,951 --> 01:11:58,870
Sherman?

1110
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:08,421
Sherman?

1111
01:12:08,463 --> 01:12:13,884
Sherman?

1112
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:23,936
Sherman?

1113
01:12:23,977 --> 01:12:25,938
Sherman?

1114
01:12:31,859 --> 01:12:35,488
Sherman, is that you?
Are you all right?

1115
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:40,034
Oh, hi, Carla. Hi.

1116
01:12:40,117 --> 01:12:42,954
- Did you have a party last night?
- Oh, no.

1117
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:46,164
My cleanin' lady's, uh Cleanin' lady's sick,
so I got to clean up myself.

1118
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:48,917
I see.
You sure she didn't die?

1119
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:54,484
Oh. Look, I'm a little embarrassed
about the way how my place is lookin'.

1120
01:12:54,484 --> 01:12:56,477
Why don't I clean up and
get back at you later?

1121
01:12:56,477 --> 01:12:58,542
No, no, no.

1122
01:12:57,425 --> 01:12:59,427
Sherman. Sherman, I need
to talk to you now.

1123
01:12:59,511 --> 01:13:02,222
- It's about Buddy.
- He hasn't been misbehavin', has he?

1124
01:13:02,305 --> 01:13:06,016
He's an egotistical pig,
and I wish I never met him.

1125
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,519
But, Sherman, I owe you
a very big apology.

1126
01:13:08,561 --> 01:13:12,273
- You owe me an apology?
- Yes. Last night I was only trying to help-

1127
01:13:12,356 --> 01:13:15,359
I insisted that Buddy Love
speak to Harlan Hartley.

1128
01:13:15,442 --> 01:13:17,528
He took all the credit
for your research.

1129
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:20,697
- Now Dean Richmond-
- Where's Buddy?

1130
01:13:23,074 --> 01:13:25,034
- Oh-
- Buddy came here?

1131
01:13:25,076 --> 01:13:27,787
- No!
- So what's this?

1132
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,623
- Are you guys. You guys share girls?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1133
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:33,042
- I guess I was next on the list.
- No, you don't understand.

1134
01:13:33,084 --> 01:13:36,588
I cannot believe
I came over here feelin' sorry for you.

1135
01:13:36,671 --> 01:13:38,589
Carla, will you please
just listen to me?

1136
01:13:38,672 --> 01:13:40,168
I assure you it is nowhat it appears to be!

1137
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:41,609
You're no better than he is!

1138
01:13:41,609 --> 01:13:45,220
You are just as sick as Buddy,
and I don't wanna see you or him again!

1139
01:13:45,304 --> 01:13:49,224
Ca-Carla, please
just listen. Carla!

1140
01:13:49,266 --> 01:13:52,561
"Eviction notice"?
"Violation of noise ordinance"?

1141
01:13:53,604 --> 01:13:55,897
Professor?

1142
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:58,441
- We have to get to the lab right away.
- Whatever it is...

1143
01:13:58,524 --> 01:14:00,443
is gonna have to wait until later.

1144
01:14:00,526 --> 01:14:04,238
No, that's the thing.
There's isn't gonna be a "later".

1145
01:14:05,907 --> 01:14:08,117
Professor, what did you do last night?

1146
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,119
Jason, I have
such a bad hangover,

1147
01:14:10,202 --> 01:14:12,496
I honestly
do not remember.

1148
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,498
Well, the good news is
I'm not going to kill you,

1149
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:17,500
not physically, anyway.

1150
01:14:17,584 --> 01:14:19,544
I am, however,
going to kill you professionally.

1151
01:14:19,586 --> 01:14:21,588
You're not only fired
from this institution,

1152
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:24,674
but I'm going to make sure you never get
hired by any other college in the state,

1153
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:26,760
the country, the world,
maybe even the universe.

1154
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,012
Unless, of course, they're looking
for teachers on Planet Fat.

1155
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:30,931
Oh, by the way,

1156
01:14:30,972 --> 01:14:33,974
Buddy Love is going to be using
your invitation to the alumni ball,

1157
01:14:34,058 --> 01:14:36,602
so show a little school spirit
and see that he gets it.

1158
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:40,606
We're in the money Put that
food down! They ate yesterday!

1159
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:46,737
...really tight and say,
"Yes, I can. "

1160
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:50,990
- Say it again.
- Yes, I can!

1161
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,623
Hey, chunky drawers!
Hey, tank ass!

1162
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,459
What are you eatin'? Muffin? Strudel?
Put it down. Let me talk to you.

1163
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:04,379
If you're receivin' this message, that
means you went and plumped back up...

1164
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:08,799
to your usual, fat, sorry,
stuff-my-face 'til-I'm-almost-dead self.

1165
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,176
Is that what you did?
Shame on you, Sherman!

1166
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,471
Do you know what you did last night?
You had the time of your life.

1167
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:17,766
Do you know you can get arrested in 50
states for the shit you did just last night?

1168
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:22,813
- Oh, my goodness!
- You know what you need to do?

1169
01:15:22,896 --> 01:15:26,482
You need to go down to the laboratory and
mix up another batch of this blue stuff.

1170
01:15:26,566 --> 01:15:29,485
Come on back to the party, Sherman,
because Carla doesn't want you.

1171
01:15:29,569 --> 01:15:32,071
She wants me.
Me, not you.

1172
01:15:32,154 --> 01:15:34,657
So come join me,
because you can't beat me.

1173
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,661
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me!

1174
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:41,122
Yes, I can!

1175
01:15:41,163 --> 01:15:43,373
Yes, I can.

1176
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:49,588
Professor, I got your message.
What's up?

1177
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:52,299
I'm goin' to that alumni ball tonight,
and I'm gonna reclaim my life.

1178
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,176
Yes! I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

1179
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,178
Get things straight
with Miss Purty,

1180
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:58,568
and I'm gonna get that
grant from Harlan Hartley.

1181
01:15:58,568 --> 01:15:59,515
Excellent.

1182
01:15:59,715 --> 01:16:03,267
Jason, we have seen the last
of Buddy Love.

1183
01:16:20,992 --> 01:16:23,620
Horace, good to see you.
The jitterbug contest just started.

1184
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:25,830
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Your table's upstairs.

1185
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,874
That's another joke.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1186
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,710
When did you marry
Sharon Stone?

1187
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:33,129
Keep those legs crossed.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1188
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,881
Hartley! Damn it!

1189
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,882
And where the hell
is Buddy Love?

1190
01:16:36,924 --> 01:16:39,426
- No sign of him yet, sir.
- Here's an idea.

1191
01:16:39,509 --> 01:16:41,511
- Find him!
- Yes, sir!

1192
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:42,780
Harlan.

1193
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,952
Well, Richmond. Where's your
Professor Buddy Love?

1194
01:16:44,952 --> 01:16:47,684
Oh, with you it's always business.
Let's get to know each other man-to-man.

1195
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:51,396
Now, if our files are correct, you and
your fabulous wife have a terrific daughter.

1196
01:16:51,438 --> 01:16:53,606
I'm divorced,
and my daughter is in rehab.

1197
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:55,983
So you're saying
our files are not correct.

1198
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:58,027
Listen, you pompous butt-kisser.

1199
01:16:58,069 --> 01:17:00,238
I have a check in my pocket
for $10 million.

1200
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:03,074
Your Buddy Love has 'til midnight
to prove that formula works.

1201
01:17:03,115 --> 01:17:05,493
He'll be here, the formula works,
and you have the check.

1202
01:17:05,576 --> 01:17:07,954
Really? On you now?
Because on behalf of- Which pocket?

1203
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:10,623
No, don't tell me.
Let me smell it. Punch?

1204
01:17:10,706 --> 01:17:12,749
Oh, come on now.
Look at this.

1205
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,793
I can't eat this.
This stuff is too tiny.

1206
01:17:14,876 --> 01:17:16,795
I can't get full
off this mess!

1207
01:17:16,878 --> 01:17:19,589
I think it's wonderful,
all the precious little finger foods.

1208
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:21,591
Finger food?
I got a finger for 'em.

1209
01:17:21,633 --> 01:17:23,760
I ain't paid no hundred-dollar ticket
for no finger food.

1210
01:17:23,802 --> 01:17:25,887
I could go down to Subway,
get me a sandwich for three dollars.

1211
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:28,139
I gotta pay a hundred-dollar ticket
for finger food?

1212
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:30,140
You must be crazy to think
I'm gonna eat this-

1213
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:32,142
- You're getting on my damn nerves! Shut up!
- I'm hungry!

1214
01:17:32,226 --> 01:17:34,645
There's Carla. I wonder
if she's seen Sherman. Carla!

1215
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:37,147
Carla. Oh.

1216
01:17:37,231 --> 01:17:40,943
Oh, oh!

1217
01:17:40,985 --> 01:17:44,154
- Oh, you look fabulous.
- Thank you, Mrs. Klump.

1218
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:46,198
- Have you seen Sherman?
- Yeah, where's Sherman at?

1219
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:48,616
I ain't come to pay no hundred-dollar
ticket to suffer this alone.

1220
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:52,453
- Cletus, shut up, please!
- Hey! That's strike two.

1221
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:55,123
I don't think Sherman
will be coming tonight.

1222
01:17:55,206 --> 01:17:57,625
Yes, he is. Sherman called me
and told me make sure we was here.

1223
01:17:57,667 --> 01:17:58,976
He got a big announcement
to make or something.

1224
01:17:58,976 --> 01:18:00,376
Something about gettin'
it all off his chest.

1225
01:18:01,893 --> 01:18:04,172
Have you noticed that Sherman's
been acting kind of strange lately?

1226
01:18:04,256 --> 01:18:06,800
Sherman has definitely
been acting strange lately.

1227
01:18:06,884 --> 01:18:09,052
I knew it!
See, Cletus? I told you.

1228
01:18:09,136 --> 01:18:11,972
You really think I be listenin' to you.
I ain't listenin' to you!

1229
01:18:12,014 --> 01:18:14,558
Well, Mrs. Klump, I hope you have
a wonderful evening.

1230
01:18:14,641 --> 01:18:17,352
Oh, you do the same.
Thank you so much.

1231
01:18:17,436 --> 01:18:20,314
So precious. Look at your little
purple dress. They gonna think we twins.

1232
01:18:20,355 --> 01:18:22,773
Mr. Klump.

1233
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:25,818
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Fabulous.

1234
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,988
You know, Cletus, I think something's
goin' on between her and Sherman.

1235
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:31,032
You don't go get up in Sherman's
business. That's Sherman's business.

1236
01:18:31,115 --> 01:18:33,826
Sherman's business?
That's my business. Sherman is my baby.

1237
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,335
Sherman's 35 years old!
What you talkin' about he's your baby?

1238
01:18:36,335 --> 01:18:37,734
I don't wanna hear it.
Shut up, please! Carla!

1239
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:39,867
That's strike three, damn it!

1240
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:43,001
Don't you walk away from me,
goddamn it!

1241
01:18:43,043 --> 01:18:46,338
- Hey, this is the last of it, Professor.
- I'll tell you this, Jason.

1242
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,549
If I'm gonna change my life, it's not
gonna come from some magic drink.

1243
01:18:49,633 --> 01:18:53,845
Gotta come from a lot of hard work
and exercise and plenty of these.

1244
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,514
Good-bye, Buddy Love.
Hello, Megashake.

1245
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,107
Professor?

1246
01:19:08,525 --> 01:19:10,569
Oh!

1247
01:19:10,653 --> 01:19:14,031
I lost 300 pounds
in 30 seconds!

1248
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:17,075
- Thanks, Megashake!
- You tricked him!

1249
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:19,827
You damn right, hamster boy.
I knew Sherman was gonna go soft on me.

1250
01:19:19,869 --> 01:19:22,747
That can wreak havoc
on a man's sex life.

1251
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:25,208
See, I've done
some calculations of my own.

1252
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:27,210
If I drink 500 milliliters
of formula,

1253
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:29,712
I'll have enough cellular stability
to be rid of Sherman's ass forever!

1254
01:19:29,754 --> 01:19:32,257
You drink that much formula at one time
and it will kill you!

1255
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,884
If I drink it all at once, yes. If I
drink half now and half later, that's safe.

1256
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:38,178
At midnight, I don't have to worry
about turning into no Klumpkin.

1257
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,109
If you don't mind, I have a
date at the alumni ball,

1258
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,616
and you have a date with linoleum.

1259
01:19:41,616 --> 01:19:43,934
Who?

1260
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,732
No, no, no, child.
Not a wild party. Not Sherman.

1261
01:19:51,774 --> 01:19:54,193
He's too shy for something like that.
He hates parties.

1262
01:19:54,235 --> 01:19:57,196
In fact, we tried to have a party
for Sherman when he was 18 years old...

1263
01:19:57,238 --> 01:19:59,407
and he's so shy,
he didn't even show up.

1264
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:02,827
Well, I must admit,
it didn't seem like the Sherman I knew.

1265
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:05,838
Oh, no, not my baby. Maybe he
loaned his house out to somebody...

1266
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:07,813
or one of his buddies was
throwin' a party there.

1267
01:20:08,652 --> 01:20:11,501
Is that a test tube in my pocket?
Or am I just happy to see you?

1268
01:20:11,585 --> 01:20:13,628
- Oh! How dare you?
- Oh, you know you loved it.

1269
01:20:13,712 --> 01:20:15,755
I felt you percolatin'. Whoo!

1270
01:20:15,797 --> 01:20:18,008
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
Thank you so much.

1271
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:20,427
Oh! What you servin' here?

1272
01:20:20,468 --> 01:20:23,597
This stuff is na- Y'all got to get
some collard greens and yams!

1273
01:20:23,638 --> 01:20:25,848
- Some red beans and rice!
- Some "Buddy" is right.

1274
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:28,142
- This ain't no party! This ain't no ball!
- Dr. Love!

1275
01:20:28,225 --> 01:20:30,144
Y'all gotta get y'all
some peach cobbler up in here!

1276
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:33,480
Dr. Love!
Where the hell have you been?

1277
01:20:33,564 --> 01:20:36,650
I've been nursemaiding Hartley for three
hours, and if I didn't need that money-

1278
01:20:36,734 --> 01:20:39,653
Shut up! Who you think
you're talkin' to, Sherman Klump?

1279
01:20:39,737 --> 01:20:42,114
Man, if you ever talk to me
like that again, I'll kill ya!

1280
01:20:42,156 --> 01:20:44,616
I don't mean that as a euphemism.
I mean I'm gonna literally kill ya.

1281
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:49,120
I'm gonna strangle you and cut off
your air supply until you pass away!

1282
01:20:49,204 --> 01:20:51,789
Now find the rich dummy a seat.
It's show time.

1283
01:20:51,831 --> 01:20:54,125
It's show time, everybody!

1284
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:58,379
Show time!

1285
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:10,807
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

1286
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,484
That's enough out of you! That's it.
You're the reason everybody fallin' asleep.

1287
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:24,695
Take a break, Nigger-ace. Take the
Everly Brothers with you. Get outta here!

1288
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:28,491
Look at everybody sleepin'
because of y'all! It's show time!

1289
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:31,869
Whoo! Now why are y'all lookin'
at me like y'all don't know me?

1290
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,497
- Y'all know me!
- I don't know that fool.

1291
01:21:34,539 --> 01:21:37,666
How 'bout now?
You recognize me?

1292
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:40,168
- I don't know that fool.
- Maybe it's because...

1293
01:21:40,252 --> 01:21:44,339
this morning
I weighed 400 pounds!

1294
01:21:44,381 --> 01:21:47,008
You should've seen me.
Look at me now.

1295
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:49,427
You know how I did it?
One sip.

1296
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:51,680
I know why he like that,
'cause he drunk.

1297
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:53,848
- Be quiet!
- Don't tell me to be quiet! He drunk!

1298
01:21:53,932 --> 01:21:57,017
I like to call it
"Buddy's Wonder Tonic. "

1299
01:21:57,101 --> 01:21:58,852
I know what
wonder tonic you had.

1300
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,564
Right on schedule.

1301
01:22:01,647 --> 01:22:06,193
Cellular destabilization
due to arrive in exactly three,

1302
01:22:06,277 --> 01:22:09,238
two, one

1303
01:22:11,532 --> 01:22:12,712
Ain't that a bitch!

1304
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:13,890
- What the hell?
- My goodness!

1305
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:18,288
Hey, moneybags, you want a demonstration?
Well, then feast your eyes on this.

1306
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,379
That's a hell of a trick.

1307
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:30,215
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final demonstration-

1308
01:22:30,257 --> 01:22:34,761
Look out, David Copperfield.
I'm about to make a 400-pound fat man...

1309
01:22:34,845 --> 01:22:37,222
disappear forever!

1310
01:22:37,306 --> 01:22:40,392
No! Wait!

1311
01:22:40,475 --> 01:22:44,313
I cannot let you do this anymore!

1312
01:22:44,396 --> 01:22:47,065
This has got to stop!

1313
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:52,069
This man is trying to kill
Professor Sherman Klump!

1314
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:55,573
- That's it. I'm glad I brought my knife.
- Mm-hmm. And I got my razor.

1315
01:22:55,656 --> 01:22:58,326
- Hand over the vial now!
- Oh, sure thing, hamster boy.

1316
01:22:58,409 --> 01:23:00,912
But first,
a short musical interlude.

1317
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:04,707
Buddy!

1318
01:23:04,749 --> 01:23:06,917
What has gotten into you,
and where is Sherman?

1319
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,294
Sherman is gone!

1320
01:23:09,377 --> 01:23:11,296
- Disappeared!
- What the hell-

1321
01:23:11,379 --> 01:23:13,924
And that's a pretty good trick for a man
with an ass as big as his.

1322
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:16,551
Oh! I'm late for an appointment.

1323
01:23:16,593 --> 01:23:19,763
Ladies and gentlemen,
say good-bye to Sherman Klump!

1324
01:23:20,055 --> 01:23:22,432
I hate being called hamster boy.

1325
01:23:22,515 --> 01:23:25,142
Ahhh!

1326
01:23:25,226 --> 01:23:27,603
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

1327
01:23:33,859 --> 01:23:36,320
It's too late, fat boy.
It's over!

1328
01:23:36,403 --> 01:23:38,948
Let go! Let go!

1329
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:42,867
- My goodness!
- Damn!

1330
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:46,538
Give it up, fat boy! It's over!

1331
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:49,290
It ain't over 'til
the fat professor sings!

1332
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:52,502
Let go of my hand, you fat mother-

1333
01:23:52,585 --> 01:23:55,797
Say one more word, Buddy,
I'll tear your arm off!

1334
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:01,802
It's time... we take...
Nestea... plunge!

1335
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:04,972
Whoo!

1336
01:24:05,013 --> 01:24:08,642
Gonna get the hell outta here
in a second. It's okay.

1337
01:24:13,272 --> 01:24:15,566
Ah!

1338
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:18,234
- Ahhh!
- Sweet Jesus!

1339
01:24:18,317 --> 01:24:23,197
- Sherman!
- Sherman, don't do this! You need me!

1340
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:27,285
No, I don't!

1341
01:24:27,326 --> 01:24:29,328
You fat ass!

1342
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:31,455
Tinkerbell!

1343
01:24:31,497 --> 01:24:34,875
- Blubber butt!
- Featherweight!

1344
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:38,169
Somebody better call
an exorcist!

1345
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:42,591
Sherman! Sherman!
You can't beat me!

1346
01:24:42,674 --> 01:24:44,384
This is some scary shit!

1347
01:24:49,514 --> 01:24:53,142
Yes, I can!

1348
01:24:53,184 --> 01:24:58,022
Ooh!

1349
01:24:58,063 --> 01:25:00,858
- Sherman, come back here! Sherman!
- What's happening to me?

1350
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:05,029
Everything's getting real dark!
Oh! I feel real jiggly!

1351
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:07,531
I'm blubbifying! Sherman!

1352
01:25:07,573 --> 01:25:11,910
You need me! I taught you to be
confident! You needed me, Sherman!

1353
01:25:11,993 --> 01:25:14,579
Sherman!
No matter what-

1354
01:25:14,662 --> 01:25:17,582
No matter what,

1355
01:25:17,665 --> 01:25:20,418
ya got to strut.

1356
01:25:29,092 --> 01:25:32,596
I ain't gonna be pickin' up your big ass
all night, Anna. Shit.

1357
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:43,565
- Oh, my God.
- Well, I'll be damned.

1358
01:25:54,742 --> 01:25:59,580
If you give me a moment,
I believe I can try to explain.

1359
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:04,751
My research is, uh-

1360
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:08,004
Well, uh, when
I started out I wa-

1361
01:26:08,088 --> 01:26:10,423
I wanted to help people.

1362
01:26:10,507 --> 01:26:13,218
But I became desperate
and selfish.

1363
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,347
What I did was wrong.

1364
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:24,270
Buddy's who I thought
the whole world wanted me to be.

1365
01:26:24,353 --> 01:26:27,857
He's who I thought
I wanted to be.

1366
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:32,403
And sometimes when you
want something so, so bad,

1367
01:26:32,444 --> 01:26:35,281
you do just about anything
to get it.

1368
01:26:40,451 --> 01:26:43,162
But I learned one thing
from Buddy.

1369
01:26:43,246 --> 01:26:46,291
I learned that life
is not about...

1370
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:51,004
bein' happy about how much you weigh,
but just bein' happy with yourself.

1371
01:26:52,922 --> 01:26:57,301
I'm terribly sorry about all this. I
hope I haven't ruined everybody's evenin'.

1372
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:59,386
Please excuse me.

1373
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:03,348
I'm sorry.

1374
01:27:17,987 --> 01:27:22,533
Sherman!

1375
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:25,369
Sherman, wait a minute.

1376
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:30,499
Sherman, why did you lie to me?

1377
01:27:30,541 --> 01:27:33,501
Why didn't you
say anything?

1378
01:27:33,585 --> 01:27:38,757
I didn't think you'd have me. I mean,
the fact of the matter is I'm a big man.

1379
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:43,512
Now, I will lose weight, but I'm
always gonna be big no matter what I do.

1380
01:27:43,595 --> 01:27:48,183
So, anybody I wind up with is just goin'
to have to accept me for who I am.

1381
01:27:48,266 --> 01:27:53,020
And more important, I'm just going
to have to accept myself for who I am.

1382
01:27:55,689 --> 01:27:57,608
Sherman,

1383
01:27:57,691 --> 01:28:00,528
I don't have a date tonight.

1384
01:28:03,405 --> 01:28:05,699
Would you like to
dance with me?

1385
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:12,413
Professor.

1386
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,210
I thought you might need this.

1387
01:28:17,252 --> 01:28:22,048
Yeah, I guess
I tore this one up, huh?

1388
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,417
You know one thing I
couldn't stand about that Buddy?

1389
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:39,659
What's that?

1390
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:42,733
He was too damn scrawny.

1391
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:46,153
Okay, Professor!
Lookin' good!

1392
01:28:46,793 --> 01:28:50,034
Have I mentioned we also
have a terrific English Department?

1393
01:28:50,034 --> 01:28:52,131
- I'm giving him the grant.
- What?

1394
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:54,161
I hate to admit it, but
you're absolutely right.

1395
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:57,800
He's a brilliant scientist and
a gentleman as well.

1396
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,784
Well, I told ya!

1397
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:03,003
- Will you shut up!
- I'm fine with that.

1398
01:29:05,422 --> 01:29:10,468
Ooh! Sherman, Sherman, Sherman,
Sherman, Sherman, Sherman, Sherman!

1399
01:29:10,552 --> 01:29:13,555
Light as a feather tonight.
Come on. Bump me.

1400
01:29:13,597 --> 01:29:16,266
Whoo, yeah!

1401
01:29:16,308 --> 01:29:19,768
Oh, oh, my goodness!
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1402
01:29:19,852 --> 01:29:22,479
- You didn't hurt yourself, did you?
- I'm fine.

1403
01:29:26,775 --> 01:29:29,778
- Yeah!
- Fabulous!
