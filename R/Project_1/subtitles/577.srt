00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:55,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get your cameras, boys.
I'm gonna light it up like Christmas.</font>

Low, he's going low.

32
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,964
Brooks, he's going down.
He's coming to your side.

33
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,927
Glassman! Glassman!

34
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,787
Okay, okay.

35
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:17,023
I know, I know. I know.
Let me take a look at you.

36
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:21,449
I know, buddy, I know.
Just be brave now, all right?

37
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:25,202
You're still good looking.
You're still very handsome.

38
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,008
You make me sick!

39
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,373
Help me!

40
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,184
Yeah!

41
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:38,661
I know.

42
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,860
You got it, buddy. You got it.
I'm right here.

43
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,378
- I want to go home.
- You will, Harry.

44
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,488
You will. All right?
You think about home. Okay?

45
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,908
Oh, boy.

46
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,318
Louie?

47
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:08,488
Lambert.

48
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:12,008
Here, take this. All right? Take this.

49
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:14,338
Okay. It's okay. Take this.

50
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,429
Pillsbury?

51
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:51,123
<i>Nice work, boys.</i>

52
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,192
Everything's shot up back there, Phil.

53
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,857
We got no hydraulics
but we're still flying.

54
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:04,002
We got no flaps, Phil.
So basically we got no brakes.

55
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,392
How far to base?

56
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:09,115
I don't know. Five hours.
If we make it that far.

57
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:13,358
The runway is over 6,000 feet, but we're
gonna need at least 10 if we got no brakes.

58
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:27,501
God created two great lights.

59
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,970
The greater light to rule over the day,

60
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,917
and the lesser light
to rule over the night.

61
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,219
Now these things,

62
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:40,794
light and dark, day and night,

63
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,267
are separated from each other.

64
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:47,442
God created each in its place.

65
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:50,515
He did not create a battle between them.

66
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:53,655
He said, "I have created
both of these things."

67
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:59,161
You must live through the night.

68
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:02,198
Don't battle with it.

69
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:07,649
For God said, "the night also is mine."

70
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:11,379
He sent his son, Jesus,
not to do battle.

71
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:16,347
Not to wage war on the sins of man,

72
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,894
but to forgive them.

73
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,039
Forgive the sin.

74
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,439
Smile on the sinner.

75
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,584
Accept the darkness.

76
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:29,764
Live through the night.

77
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:34,436
Love thine enemy.

78
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:40,486
Zamperini!

80
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:26,803
Is that garlic I smell?

81
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,855
What are you doing, wop?

82
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:30,481
Hey, why don't you go back to Italy?

83
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,421
You and your greasy wop family.

84
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,125
- Get him up.
- Get up.

85
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:39,365
- Hey! Hey!
- Get off him!

86
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:51,489
Stay down. Dumb dago.

87
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,800
- Hey! Hey!
- Get him off me!

88
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,093
Jesus.

89
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,061
Hey!

90
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,391
- Oh, shit!
- Go, go, go.

91
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,221
Only reason
you're not in reform school now

92
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,158
is because of the respect
we have for your parents.

93
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:15,652
Everybody in town wants you put away.

94
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,782
Sorry, Louise. He was fighting again.

95
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:32,433
And... we found this.

96
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:35,942
He painted the bottle. It's liquor.

97
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,127
What do you think?
He's kinda cute, right?

98
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:50,515
Come on, Jimmy, pick it up! Go, go, go!

99
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,817
Come on, Pete! Go!

100
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,777
Come on, pass him!

101
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,518
Is someone down there?

102
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:59,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's down there?</font>

103
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:20,586
- This is so dumb.
- Since when were you so smart?

104
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:24,549
- Come<font color="#FFFFFF"> on. Faster.
- Why? No one's chasing me.</font>

105
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,796
I'm <font color="#FFFFFF">chasing you.</font>

106
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:35,852
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do this, Pete. I'm not like you.</font>

107
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:39,314
I'm not<font color="#FFFFFF">hing. Just let me be nothing.</font>

108
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:43,084
<font color="#FFFFFF">- What are you talking about?
- I can't make a track team.</font>

109
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:45,153
- I <font color="#FFFFFF">don't even know why you want me to.
- Yes, you can.</font>

110
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:47,543
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you can take it, you can make it.</font>

111
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,682
<font color="#FFFFFF">What?</font>

112
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,909
If <font color="#FFFFFF">you can take it, you can make it.</font>

113
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:55,637
All right. You train and you fight
way harder than those other guys.

114
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,333
And you win.
You get out from under them.

115
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:02,208
Or you keep going the way you're going
and you end up as a bum in the streets.

116
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:08,425
You can do this, Lou.
Just gotta believe you can.

117
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,847
I don't believe.

118
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,386
I do.

119
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,950
Come on.

120
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,836
Come on!

121
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:53,736
You dumb dago!

122
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:15,406
Come on, Louie!

123
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:21,448
<i>Boy, oh, boy, can that guy fly.</i>

124
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,689
<i>They're calling him
The Torrance Tornado.</i>

125
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,555
<i>This kid Zamperini runs like his feet
never touch the ground.</i>

126
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,945
Come on! Come on! Keep going!

127
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:23,598
Come on, Louie!

128
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,313
Come on, Louie! Come on, Louie!

129
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:31,306
Come on, come on, come on!

130
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:39,871
<i>The Torrance Tornado smoked the mile
in 4 minutes, 21.3 seconds.</i>

131
00:18:39,971 --> 00:18:44,042
<i>Zamperini is now officially the fastest
high school runner in American history.</i>

132
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:47,282
<i>Folks, this kid is on his way
to the Olympics!</i>

133
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:50,940
Why would I come?
You're not going to win.

134
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,610
Sure. I know that. It's all right.

135
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,571
Four years' time, next Olympics,
that's when I show them.

136
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:58,961
This is just the tryouts for me.

137
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,627
- Tokyo.
- Tokyo.

138
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,125
Smart kid.

139
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:11,618
Take care of yourself, all right?

140
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,223
Go have a little fun, too.

141
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:16,215
Say hi to those pretty
German broads for me.

142
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,300
You know it.

143
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,221
Come here.

144
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,236
Thanks, Pete.

145
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,695
For everything.

146
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,228
Go on.

147
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,459
Louie.

148
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:53,059
A moment of pain
is worth a lifetime of glory.

149
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,175
You remember that.

150
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:20,670
- Gear is down.
- All right, here we go.

151
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,719
Still coming in pretty hot. 110.

152
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:34,976
Almost.

153
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,561
Still too fast.

154
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,362
Come on.

155
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

156
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:31,073
Okay.

157
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:37,866
Flat tire.

158
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,610
Thank you, God.

159
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:32,893
Now you're praying?

160
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:36,387
I was busy before.

161
00:22:40,937 --> 00:22:43,214
My mother does that sometimes.

162
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:46,590
Yeah. A lot of people do this.

163
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:52,661
He say anything back?

164
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,769
- Yeah.
- What?

165
00:22:57,036 --> 00:23:00,080
He says my bombardier is a dope.

166
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:08,209
Really?

167
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,725
All right, buddy.

168
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,061
Now!

169
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:33,288
Come on, Louie!

170
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,009
Keep on, buddy.

171
00:23:44,642 --> 00:23:46,462
Keep pushing.

172
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,617
Whoa!

173
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,337
Yeah?

174
00:23:58,598 --> 00:23:59,974
Oh, boy!

175
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,627
4:12. Getting close.

176
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:05,777
I hope you're not that fast in the sack.

177
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,611
Oh, boy.

178
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,368
Wrap it up, speedy.

179
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:21,827
We got a mission.
Not a combat mission. Rescue.

180
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:27,478
B-24 en route to Kanton never made it
so looks like those boys ditched.

181
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,750
A lot of ocean.

182
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:33,871
Yeah. And... they got us some new crew.

183
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,800
We get a new plane?

184
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,052
This is just like sitting in a living room
trying to fly the house.

185
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:55,013
They've been taking parts off this
for other planes.

186
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:57,248
We're lucky it's still got an engine.

187
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,851
Lieutenant says it's airworthy.

188
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,821
It's been certified, he says.

189
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:04,617
By Helen Keller.

190
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,887
Lot of ocean.

191
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:21,592
<i>Yeah. Lot of ocean.</i>

192
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,586
- Mitchell.
- Yeah.

193
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:28,420
You're up.

194
00:25:38,114 --> 00:25:41,244
So a duck walks into a bar, right?

195
00:25:42,602 --> 00:25:44,502
Or, waddles, if you will.

196
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:49,133
So, he walks into the bar,
he says to the bartender,

197
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:51,994
"can I have a crème de menthe?"

198
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:59,978
Hang on, there.
All right, number one is out.

199
00:26:00,078 --> 00:26:02,345
- Other engines are burning more fuel.
- Gotta feather it.

200
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:05,083
Hey...

201
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:07,001
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

202
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:10,016
Engineer? Can you come up
to the cockpit and feather the engine?

203
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:13,883
- What's going on, guys?
- Co-pilot to radio. Send to base.

204
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:15,927
- Which one?
- The left.

205
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,346
- We need more on the right.
- That's all we got on the right.

206
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:20,660
- We need more on the right!
- That's all we got on the right.

207
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:27,004
- Damn it!
- Left engines are both gone.

208
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,777
- That's everything on the right, Phil.
- Okay.

209
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,582
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

210
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,010
Is this a...

211
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:42,464
Prepare to crash.

212
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:47,175
Waist gunner! Get the rations box.

213
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,345
Tie the guns down.

214
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:52,444
- Who's on the raft?
- Glassman!

215
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:55,775
- Send Mayday.
- Is everyone in position?

216
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,760
- Anyone on the rafts?
- Yeah.

217
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,940
I got it!

218
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,055
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!

219
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:05,325
This is Green Hornet. We are going down.
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!

220
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,120
Okay.

221
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:10,327
Everybody brace.

222
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:12,250
Brace!

223
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:19,158
<i>In an astounding performance,</i>

224
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:24,372
<i>negro American Jesse Owens from Ohio State
has won four gold medals in the 100 meter,</i>

225
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:28,309
<i>the 200 meter, the long jump
and the 400 meter relay.</i>

226
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,587
<i>Next up, the 5,000 meter
with America's record-breaking</i>

227
00:28:31,687 --> 00:28:36,395
<i>Don Lash leading the American team.
Along with newcomer Louie Zamperini.</i>

228
00:28:50,381 --> 00:28:51,646
Fertig!

229
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,508
<i>And already,
three sections of runners have formed</i>

230
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:17,892
<i>with America's Don Lash and the Finnish
Salminen and Höckert ahead of the pack.</i>

231
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:21,652
<i>The Finns always the favorite
in this long-haul event.</i>

232
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,148
<i>In the second group
is America's Louie Zamperini.</i>

233
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,428
<i>The Finns, Höckert,
Lehtinen and Salminen have set the pace</i>

234
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,681
<i>and they are not letting up.</i>

235
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:43,142
<i>And Zamperini is fading, too,
dropping further back.</i>

236
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:03,713
<i>And into the 8th lap</i>

237
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:07,525
<i>it's the Finns still in the lead,
with Salminen in first place.</i>

238
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,545
Come on, Louie.

239
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,873
<i>Come on, Louie.</i>

240
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:24,008
<i>And we start the last lap.</i>

241
00:30:24,108 --> 00:30:25,860
<i>The Finns seem to be in control.</i>

242
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,880
<i>It doesn't look like Don Lash
is gonna bring home the medal for the USA.</i>

243
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:37,663
<i>There seems to be
some movement back in the pack.</i>

244
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:42,673
<i>Yes, that's Zamperini
overtaking Norway's Rolf Hansen.</i>

245
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,325
<i>He seems to have some gas in reserve.</i>

246
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,585
<i>He really is making up some time.</i>

247
00:30:56,023 --> 00:31:00,044
<i>Höckert and Lehtinen will be one and two.
But look at that Zamperini!</i>

248
00:31:00,144 --> 00:31:02,404
<i>He's got Don Lash in his sights.</i>

249
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:08,119
<i>Well, the great Don Lash is not
gonna be the first American, folks.</i>

250
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:12,816
<i>It's high school kid Zamperini pushing past
the record-breakers on this field!</i>

251
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:18,157
<i>I have not seen that!
I have not seen that!</i>

252
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:26,988
<i>That final lap, folks,
the record for that was 69.2 seconds.</i>

253
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:29,907
<i>Zamperini just did it in 56 seconds.</i>

254
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:33,707
<i>That record is going to hold
for a while, let me tell you.</i>

255
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:53,856
All right, Phil. Okay, buddy. All right.

256
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:59,219
On three. Two. Three.

257
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:08,465
Okay.

258
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:42,451
All right, here we go.

259
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,570
Glassman didn't make it.

260
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,536
- Cup didn't make it.
- Don't think about it, Mac.

261
00:35:10,086 --> 00:35:13,352
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not, Mac.

262
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:19,759
- They don't know where we are.
- They'll find us.

263
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:22,808
They'll never see us.

264
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,328
Tell him to shut up.

265
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:28,788
- Shut up, Mac.
- We're gonna die out here.

266
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:31,398
Come on, Mac, shut up.

267
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:46,683
Hey, Mac, chocolate.

268
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:51,015
One square at night,
one square in the morning.

269
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,018
All right?

270
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:58,868
Mac?

271
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:02,706
Two or three sips a day, yeah?

272
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:05,954
We gotta make it last.

273
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:15,081
Zamp?

274
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:17,418
- Zamp?
- Yeah, yeah?

275
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,348
Yeah, Phil?

276
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:26,739
I'm glad it's you.

277
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,962
Yeah, I'm glad it's me, too.

278
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,693
What was that?

279
00:37:44,824 --> 00:37:48,490
Mac! Mac! Mac, come on!
Get the dye, Mac. Get the dye.

280
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:52,533
- Hey!
- Hey!

281
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:55,812
Hey!

282
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:00,954
- Hey!
- Hey!

283
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:02,759
Down here!

284
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:05,148
- Hey!
- Turn around!

285
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:12,784
You son of a bitch!

286
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,957
Turn around!

287
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:53,249
What did you do, Mac?

288
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:58,856
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter?

289
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:01,007
It doesn't matter?

290
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,002
It doesn't matter.

291
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:39,095
Jesus!

292
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:44,551
Get it, Mac! Get it.

293
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:02,449
I don't think I can do it.

294
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,144
We gotta try.

295
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:21,656
We had to try.

296
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:25,626
You know what?

297
00:41:26,312 --> 00:41:28,974
Maybe the fish won't be so picky.

298
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:45,189
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah?

299
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:47,584
I got one. Yeah.

300
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:49,794
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:51,779
Attaboy, Phil!

302
00:41:54,382 --> 00:41:56,484
Here, here, here.

303
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:58,151
Damn it.

304
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:04,233
Okay.

305
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:10,148
Come here, Mac.

306
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:13,805
Come on.

307
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:18,851
Okay.

308
00:42:20,642 --> 00:42:22,597
Buon appetito.

309
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:34,392
Good?

310
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:43,790
This is how the Japanese eat fish. Raw.

311
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,650
If you ask me,
it's not food until you cook it.

312
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:49,976
Little lemon,

313
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:52,239
little garlic...

314
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:56,994
When we get home, come around my house.
Mama will cook for ya.

315
00:42:57,328 --> 00:43:02,061
You remember that story in Life Magazine
about Eddie Rickenbacker?

316
00:43:03,576 --> 00:43:06,856
Him and his crew ran out
of fuel over the pacific.

317
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:10,249
They were drifting in rafts for 24 days.

318
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:13,174
Twenty-four days.

319
00:43:13,878 --> 00:43:16,671
- They made it, right?
- Yeah.

320
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:20,485
Most of them lost their minds.

321
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:22,792
But they made it.

322
00:43:25,248 --> 00:43:27,317
We gotta keep talking.

323
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:30,037
Gotta keep our minds sharp.

324
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:35,229
Hey, I'll tell you what else
you're gonna love. Mama's gnocchi.

325
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:37,779
- Italians.
- Nobody...

326
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,431
Nobody a-make-a gnocchi like her.

327
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:46,454
So light.

328
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:49,228
Like clouds.

329
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:55,440
First, she makes the dough
out of very fine flour.

330
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:59,267
So fine, it's like talcum powder.

331
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,400
Then she uses lots of eggs,
like, maybe 12.

332
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:12,290
And then she beats them up, Mac.

333
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:17,343
Beats them up.

334
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:21,248
And she drizzles them over.

335
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:04,698
...thou me on

336
00:45:05,156 --> 00:45:08,673
The night is dark

337
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:13,682
And I am far from home

338
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:19,937
Lead thou me on

339
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:38,064
Do you think God made the stars, Phil?

340
00:45:41,426 --> 00:45:43,516
Yes, I do.

341
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:48,683
So you think there's some
kind of a grand plan?

342
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:52,526
Why did we live and the others didn't?

343
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:57,316
Why are we here now?

344
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,454
Here's the plan.

345
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:05,200
You go on living the best you can.

346
00:46:06,968 --> 00:46:10,536
You try to have some fun along the way.

347
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:15,961
Then one day it's over.

348
00:46:17,228 --> 00:46:19,030
You'll wake up

349
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,590
and there's an angel
sitting at the edge of your bed.

350
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,630
Angel says,

351
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:31,375
"Okay,

352
00:46:32,452 --> 00:46:36,192
"you can ask me
all those dumb questions now

353
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:42,111
"because I got all the answers."

354
00:46:43,488 --> 00:46:45,978
That's what you believe?

355
00:46:47,425 --> 00:46:49,045
Yeah.

356
00:46:49,761 --> 00:46:52,134
That's what I believe.

357
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:20,581
Our father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

358
00:47:22,293 --> 00:47:26,777
If you get me through this,
if you answer my prayers

359
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:31,794
I swear I'll dedicate
my whole life to you.

360
00:47:35,873 --> 00:47:38,023
I'll do whatever you want.

361
00:47:43,356 --> 00:47:45,209
Please.

362
00:48:58,289 --> 00:48:59,869
Mac.

363
00:49:19,277 --> 00:49:20,311
Here we go.

364
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:22,397
- Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
- All right, all right.

365
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:25,585
You got it?

366
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,101
Jeez.

367
00:50:01,978 --> 00:50:04,107
Just a scratch.

368
00:50:13,798 --> 00:50:15,966
- How is it?
- Stinks.

369
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:18,469
That's the bandage,

370
00:50:19,345 --> 00:50:20,588
not you.

371
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,040
We beat Rickenbacker's record

372
00:50:27,378 --> 00:50:28,808
four days ago.

373
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:33,076
You're keeping count?

374
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:35,440
Yeah.

375
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:07,617
Hey. Hey.

376
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:16,542
Hey.

377
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:52,864
Hey!

378
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:57,399
Oh, God.

379
00:51:58,094 --> 00:52:00,226
Oh, my God.

380
00:52:00,671 --> 00:52:02,570
Hey!

381
00:52:06,844 --> 00:52:08,898
Hey!

382
00:52:58,938 --> 00:53:00,990
- Get out, boys. Get out!
- I can't!

383
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,650
Come on!

384
00:53:52,283 --> 00:53:54,210
- Mac?
- Still here.

385
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,846
- Still here.
- Phil?

386
00:53:56,946 --> 00:54:00,675
If the Japs are this bad,
we might even win this damn war.

387
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,285
Shit.

388
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:28,889
Phil.

389
00:54:31,656 --> 00:54:32,886
Here.

390
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:24,785
Mac.

391
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:39,058
Did you see that surprise Mac attack?

392
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:47,439
Came down on that thing
like a goddamn dive bomber.

393
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:52,085
Damn sharks were scared shit.

394
00:55:53,763 --> 00:55:56,277
He saved your skinny ass.

395
00:56:07,218 --> 00:56:12,028
1937. Baseball MVP.

396
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,949
Kid from Detroit.

397
00:56:20,048 --> 00:56:21,828
Gehringer.

398
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:29,014
Hey, Mac, get in the game.

00:56:40,935 --> 00:56:43,615
- Mac?
- Still here.

401
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:46,255
Still here.

402
00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:52,238
What are you gonna make
for breakfast, Zamp?

403
00:56:54,824 --> 00:56:57,054
It's your call.

404
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,840
Your mother's gnocchi.

405
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,514
Gnocchi for breakfast?

406
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,941
Why not?

407
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:22,351
Am I gonna die?

408
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:35,352
Maybe, Mac.

409
00:57:39,786 --> 00:57:42,158
You think tonight?

410
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:50,104
Maybe.

411
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,022
Yes, sir.

412
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,366
I think tonight.

413
00:58:09,123 --> 00:58:11,643
So you got your dough...

414
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,590
and you roll it out.

415
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:19,354
Just rolling it out.

416
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:22,561
Good, no lumps.

417
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:02,804
Phil?

418
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:10,169
I got good news...

419
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:14,348
and bad news.

420
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:38,242

<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah.</font>

01:03:02,516 --> 01:03:04,576
I wouldn't know.

433
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:08,802
I haven't been there in...

434
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:18,992
Is this you?

435
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:29,943
You are famous Olympic athlete.

436
01:03:33,765 --> 01:03:37,769
Colonel would like to know
location of radar in E-class, B-24.

437
01:03:37,869 --> 01:03:39,999
We used the old one. D-class.

438
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:43,234
- You bombardier?
- Yes.

439
01:03:46,294 --> 01:03:49,314
What happened to the marines
from Makin Island?

440
01:03:54,427 --> 01:03:55,912
How you work the Norden bombsight?

441
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:59,451
You just twist two knobs.
What happened to the marines?

442
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:06,763
Draw Norden bombsight.

443
01:04:21,662 --> 01:04:22,982
They were beheaded.

444
01:05:31,215 --> 01:05:33,052
Fuck!

445
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,443
Take off clothes.

446
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:19,439
Kneel down.

447
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:23,244
Kneel down?

448
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:25,531
Kneel down!

449
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:19,449
- No, no! No, no!
- Phil?

450
01:09:20,445 --> 01:09:23,025
- Phil?
- Zamp!

451
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:24,966
- Zamp!
- Phil?

452
01:09:25,266 --> 01:09:26,816
Zamp!

453
01:09:55,864 --> 01:09:57,892
This is Tokyo, right?

454
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:00,220
Must be.

455
01:10:01,402 --> 01:10:04,213
I was supposed to race here
for the Olympics...

456
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,399
before they got canceled.

457
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:08,312
Yeah?

458
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:11,334
I always wanted to come to Tokyo.

459
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:16,095
Careful what you wish for, fella.

460
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:11,412
Soldier. Soldier.

461
01:11:11,512 --> 01:11:12,601
Officer.

462
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:15,628
Soldier.

463
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:17,992
Officer.

464
01:12:04,584 --> 01:12:09,164
Good evening, old prisoners.

465
01:12:09,814 --> 01:12:12,959
Welcome, new hands.

466
01:12:13,759 --> 01:12:18,529
This is Omori detention camp.

467
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:25,131
I am Corporal Watanabe.

468
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:34,794
You are enemies of Japan.

469
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:41,151
You will be treated accordingly.

470
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:19,612
Look at me.

471
01:13:24,063 --> 01:13:26,196
Look me in the eye.

472
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:05,544
Look at me!

473
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:22,275
Don't look at me.

474
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:26,296
Don't look at me.

475
01:14:36,302 --> 01:14:38,448
New prisoners,

476
01:14:38,848 --> 01:14:41,278
you are not dismissed.

477
01:14:41,766 --> 01:14:44,365
You will stand a quarantine.

478
01:14:45,495 --> 01:14:49,698
We cannot have disease in the barracks.

479
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,399
- Evening, chaps.
- Evening, sir.

480
01:15:31,499 --> 01:15:33,468
Tom Miller, your barrack commander.

481
01:15:33,568 --> 01:15:35,558
Let's get you settled
into your bunks, shall we?

482
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:42,204
You're up top.

484
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,370
you're here next to sleeping beauty.

485
01:15:51,686 --> 01:15:53,566
Take a pew.

486
01:15:54,105 --> 01:15:56,785
307, you're in here.

487
01:15:58,109 --> 01:15:59,702
You are?

488
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:03,238
- Frank Tinker.
- Tinker, you're up top.

489
01:16:07,076 --> 01:16:08,286
I see you met the bird.

490
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:17,278
- Why do you call him "the bird"?
- Because he listens.

491
01:16:17,678 --> 01:16:21,728
And if he heard the names
we'd like to call him, he'd kill us.

492
01:16:22,133 --> 01:16:24,085
Apparently he grew up wealthy.

493
01:16:24,185 --> 01:16:27,395
Wanted to be an officer.
Expected to be, too.

494
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:31,542
And was denied, which obviously
hasn't gone down too well.

495
01:16:31,642 --> 01:16:35,582
Of course, none of this explains
his erratic behavior.

496
01:16:38,816 --> 01:16:40,426
Commander Fitzgerald.

497
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:43,381
Zamperini, sir.

498
01:16:48,659 --> 01:16:50,895
They were looking for answers.

499
01:16:50,995 --> 01:16:53,106
Didn't get any though, did they?

500
01:16:53,206 --> 01:16:55,365
Not one bit.

501
01:16:58,377 --> 01:16:59,667
You should get some shut-eye.

502
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:02,537
Yes, sir.

503
01:17:33,704 --> 01:17:36,457
Infirmary, turning right!

504
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:38,637
Dismissed!

505
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,503
Officers, turning right!

506
01:17:43,047 --> 01:17:45,059
Dismissed!

507
01:18:16,998 --> 01:18:21,144
There is much talent in Omori camp.

508
01:18:23,337 --> 01:18:25,047
We have an opera singer.

509
01:18:26,465 --> 01:18:28,085
Who is the opera singer?

510
01:18:34,515 --> 01:18:37,366
We have a chef...

511
01:18:37,466 --> 01:18:40,894
from Sydney, Australia.

512
01:18:42,415 --> 01:18:46,875
And we have an Olympic athlete.

513
01:18:49,113 --> 01:18:51,873
Who is the Olympic athlete?

514
01:18:56,454 --> 01:19:00,358
Who is the Olympic athlete?

515
01:19:40,373 --> 01:19:42,353
Don't get up.

516
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,549
You fail.

517
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,075
You are nothing.

518
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:15,513
Sir?

519
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:21,791
He's tracing so we can return it
before the Japs find out.

520
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:24,701
He's got most of the war mapped out.

521
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,493
We've invaded the Marshall Islands.

522
01:21:35,071 --> 01:21:38,166
The US have invaded
the Marshall Islands.

523
01:21:38,266 --> 01:21:41,076
Allies are gaining ground.

524
01:22:39,777 --> 01:22:42,017
- You know, I gotta say...
- Please don't.

525
01:22:42,117 --> 01:22:45,266
For a bunch of guys who don't eat anything
we sure do shit a lot.

526
01:22:47,852 --> 01:22:49,712
Oh, yeah.

527
01:22:49,812 --> 01:22:51,831
I think that one is mine.

528
01:24:11,169 --> 01:24:13,439
You like Saipan?

529
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:43,268
I'm gonna kill him.

530
01:24:44,402 --> 01:24:48,474
- Then they shoot you.
- I don't give a damn. Let them shoot me.

531
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:53,095
That's not how we beat them.

532
01:24:53,769 --> 01:24:57,359
We beat them by making it
to the end of the war alive.

533
01:24:57,982 --> 01:24:59,922
That's how we do it.

534
01:25:00,902 --> 01:25:03,172
That's our revenge.

535
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,623
If I can take it, I can make it.

536
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,937
Precisely.

537
01:25:11,037 --> 01:25:15,773
My brother Pete used to say that.
He used to think that I could do anything.

538
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:20,170
He used to think
that I was better than I am.

539
01:25:21,422 --> 01:25:23,512
Who says you're not?

540
01:25:44,028 --> 01:25:46,033
We're getting closer.

541
01:26:55,516 --> 01:26:57,766
Why do you make me hit you?

542
01:27:10,031 --> 01:27:12,181
You are dead.

543
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:20,055
In America, they say Zamperini dead.

544
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,779
They tell your family you died in war.

545
01:27:24,879 --> 01:27:27,281
NBC radio tell America

546
01:27:27,381 --> 01:27:32,191
famous Olympic runner Zamperini is dead.

547
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:39,773
You want to tell family you're not dead?

548
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,610
These gentlemen,

549
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,650
they're from radio Tokyo.

550
01:27:46,426 --> 01:27:49,046
We have program go all over world.

551
01:27:50,054 --> 01:27:52,764
It is name Postman Calls.

552
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:01,446
"Hello, mother.

553
01:28:01,733 --> 01:28:03,998
"Your son is calling you.

554
01:28:04,385 --> 01:28:07,252
"Mother, I love you.

555
01:28:07,513 --> 01:28:09,663
"I'm alive and well."

556
01:28:55,912 --> 01:28:59,415
- I'm only saying my own words.
- Of course.

557
01:29:18,393 --> 01:29:20,643
Hello, America.

558
01:29:22,897 --> 01:29:24,817
This is The Postman Calls.

559
01:29:24,982 --> 01:29:28,845
Today The Postman calls
for Mrs. Louise Zamperini

560
01:29:28,945 --> 01:29:31,222
of Torrance, California.

561
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:33,884
Louie Zamperini is not missing,

562
01:29:33,984 --> 01:29:38,296
and not dead as erroneously announced
by your government.

563
01:29:38,596 --> 01:29:42,066
He is safe and sound with us.

564
01:29:42,366 --> 01:29:46,706
So keep listening, Mrs. Zamperini...
and don't mention it.

565
01:29:46,806 --> 01:29:50,441
The pleasure is all ours.

566
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:57,680
Hello, mother and father,
sisters and friends.

567
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:02,337
This is your Louie talking.

568
01:30:02,437 --> 01:30:05,857
And the first time in two years
that you will have heard my voice.

569
01:30:08,901 --> 01:30:11,771
I am uninjured and in good health.

570
01:30:15,616 --> 01:30:18,503
I am now interned
in a Tokyo prisoner of war camp

571
01:30:18,603 --> 01:30:22,393
being treated as well as can be expected
under wartime conditions.

572
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:28,682
I hope Pete is still able to pay you
his weekly visits from San Diego.

573
01:30:31,883 --> 01:30:33,743
Dad...

574
01:30:33,843 --> 01:30:38,081
Keep my guns in good condition
so we can go hunting when I get home.

575
01:30:40,658 --> 01:30:44,228
Get some good rabbits
for Mom's gnocchi sauce.

576
01:30:46,898 --> 01:30:50,978
I wish you all a merry Christmas
and a happy new year.

577
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:57,959
Your loving son, Louie.

578
01:31:32,568 --> 01:31:35,905
You were good. Very good.

579
01:31:38,324 --> 01:31:41,014
You can speak on radio again.

580
01:31:54,157 --> 01:31:55,700
I can't say this.

581
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,177
- Why not?
- Because it's not true.

582
01:31:59,971 --> 01:32:02,692
What it says about America,
I can't say that.

583
01:32:05,184 --> 01:32:07,324
They say that.

584
01:32:08,037 --> 01:32:09,997
American like you.

585
01:32:10,665 --> 01:32:13,860
They live here. Very comfortable.

586
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,690
Good food.

587
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:21,438
They have lovely food.

588
01:32:27,832 --> 01:32:29,072
You want to go back to camp?

589
01:32:33,171 --> 01:32:35,761
You make broadcast.

590
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,740
You are like me.

591
01:33:30,561 --> 01:33:33,211
We are both strong.

592
01:33:34,065 --> 01:33:37,593
I saw it in your eyes...

593
01:33:37,693 --> 01:33:40,073
the first day.

594
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:41,940
I thought...

595
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,090
this man will be my friend.

596
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:50,491
But...

597
01:33:50,873 --> 01:33:54,553
enemy of Japan.

598
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,760
You do not listen.

599
01:33:58,381 --> 01:34:01,791
You do not do what is asked of you.

600
01:34:10,034 --> 01:34:13,474
It is necessary to have respect.

601
01:34:14,397 --> 01:34:16,507
No respect...

602
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:18,457
no order.

603
01:34:24,882 --> 01:34:28,242
This man must be taught respect.

604
01:34:28,469 --> 01:34:33,219
All other prisoners
will teach him this lesson.

605
01:34:35,168 --> 01:34:37,603
Each prisoner...

606
01:34:37,795 --> 01:34:42,105
will punch this man in his face.

607
01:34:53,895 --> 01:34:55,315
Sir...

608
01:34:56,898 --> 01:34:59,128
We cannot do that.

609
01:35:36,996 --> 01:35:38,366
Do it.

610
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:42,881
Do it, sir. Come on.

611
01:35:44,061 --> 01:35:46,021
Just get it over with.

612
01:35:46,255 --> 01:35:48,995
Punch him in the face.

613
01:35:54,247 --> 01:35:55,717
Come on.

614
01:35:56,616 --> 01:35:58,158
Punch him!

615
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:06,142
- Next!
- Go on.

616
01:36:06,242 --> 01:36:08,228
Come on, come on, come on.

617
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:15,593
Next!

618
01:36:17,603 --> 01:36:19,997
Okay. Come on, come on, sir.

619
01:36:20,097 --> 01:36:21,791
Come on.

620
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:26,688
- Hit hard!
- Come on! Hit me!

621
01:36:29,507 --> 01:36:30,767
Next!

622
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:34,267
Come on, Tink, hit me good. Go on.

623
01:36:36,386 --> 01:36:37,907
Next!

624
01:36:38,641 --> 01:36:39,817
Come on.

625
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:42,294
Next!

626
01:36:51,696 --> 01:36:53,686
Hit hard!

627
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:58,448
Next!

628
01:37:22,994 --> 01:37:24,404
Harder!

629
01:37:31,235 --> 01:37:33,072
Next!

630
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:40,553
Next!

631
01:37:45,182 --> 01:37:46,859
Next!

632
01:38:48,813 --> 01:38:50,840
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

633
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,492
Cinderella!

634
01:38:52,592 --> 01:38:55,161
Where is that naughty little maggot?

635
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:57,491
Have you seen her, fella?

636
01:38:57,847 --> 01:38:59,740
There you are, you lazy little girl.

637
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,294
How am I supposed to get ready for the ball
with you sitting there doing nothing?

638
01:39:03,394 --> 01:39:07,347
That's as useful to us
as our morning dance routines.

639
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:17,241
Fix my dress so I can catch the eye
of the dreamy prince Hillenbrand.

640
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:20,011
You couldn't catch the eye of a prince
if it fell in your lap.

641
01:39:20,111 --> 01:39:22,681
Come, Cinders, fix my hair.

642
01:39:24,115 --> 01:39:26,117
Fix my dress!

643
01:39:26,217 --> 01:39:28,136
- Fix my hair!
- Dress!

644
01:39:28,236 --> 01:39:31,422
- Hair, hair, hair!
- Are you speaking kraut now?

645
01:39:31,522 --> 01:39:33,466
Enough! Enough!

646
01:39:33,566 --> 01:39:38,596
You guys make me do all these stupid,
impossible things with no food and no rest!

647
01:39:38,796 --> 01:39:43,099
You lock me up in a rabbit hutch.
I've had enough!

648
01:39:43,493 --> 01:39:45,703
I have good news.

649
01:39:48,314 --> 01:39:50,842
I have had a promotion.

650
01:39:50,942 --> 01:39:53,179
That's the good news.

651
01:39:54,504 --> 01:39:56,714
The bad news?

652
01:39:59,217 --> 01:40:02,087
I say goodbye to my friends.

653
01:40:08,935 --> 01:40:11,977
I leave Omori tomorrow.

654
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:20,538
Nothing in this life
is hopeless, Cinders.

655
01:40:20,638 --> 01:40:23,541
If you keep your head and your heart

656
01:40:23,741 --> 01:40:27,781
you can do anything!

657
01:40:28,579 --> 01:40:33,751
Fear not, dear child...
I am your fairy godmother.

658
01:40:33,851 --> 01:40:36,421
You may congratulate me.

659
01:41:17,153 --> 01:41:19,533
And there he goes.

660
01:41:20,798 --> 01:41:22,895
Just like that.

661
01:41:37,582 --> 01:41:39,582
I have got...

662
01:41:39,817 --> 01:41:41,127
four kings.

663
01:41:41,486 --> 01:41:43,310
And there you go.

664
01:41:43,988 --> 01:41:46,015
The baron's been beaten, Tinker.

665
01:41:46,115 --> 01:41:47,850
- Oh, yeah?
- Sugar for us tonight.

666
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:45,568
- Got it, Miller?
- Send another bucket!

667
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:56,230
We're helping the Japs now?

668
01:42:56,611 --> 01:43:00,092
- Might as well let it burn.
- Pass it down!

669
01:43:01,482 --> 01:43:02,522
There you go.

670
01:43:16,522 --> 01:43:19,062
B-29s, boys!

671
01:43:21,319 --> 01:43:23,217
Won't be long now.

672
01:43:23,404 --> 01:43:25,790
I wouldn't get too excited.

673
01:43:26,074 --> 01:43:28,409
If the allies win,

674
01:43:28,509 --> 01:43:31,370
the Japs issue kill-all orders.

675
01:43:32,822 --> 01:43:35,072
I overheard them.

676
01:43:36,684 --> 01:43:39,124
We win, we're dead.

677
01:43:41,964 --> 01:43:45,054
Well, what are we supposed
to be praying for?

678
01:43:47,403 --> 01:43:49,566
Down! Get down!

679
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,354
Grab your gear. They're moving us out.

680
01:44:00,266 --> 01:44:04,260
- To where?
- I don't know. Some new camp.

681
01:44:04,462 --> 01:44:08,934
Tokyo Ritz.
Some place the allies can't find us.

682
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:27,654
This is Naoetsu prison camp.

683
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:32,405
I am Sergeant Watanabe,

684
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:34,835
your commanding officer.

685
01:48:36,108 --> 01:48:40,788
You are enemies of Japan.

686
01:48:41,305 --> 01:48:43,785
You will be treated...

687
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:46,639
accordingly.

688
01:48:49,397 --> 01:48:51,841
You will help the Japanese

689
01:48:51,941 --> 01:48:54,971
by working on the coal barges.

690
01:48:55,269 --> 01:48:58,809
Anyone who will not work...

691
01:49:00,216 --> 01:49:02,405
will be executed.

692
01:49:11,644 --> 01:49:14,366
Why don't you look me in the eye?

693
01:49:20,678 --> 01:49:23,048
You boys can sleep here.

694
01:49:26,534 --> 01:49:28,544
You two over there.

695
01:49:34,534 --> 01:49:36,571
This is the end, mates.

696
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:39,215
No one knows you're here.

697
01:49:40,698 --> 01:49:43,568
It's best if you just resign
to your fate.

698
01:51:21,896 --> 01:51:25,791
Your president Roosevelt...

699
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:29,491
is dead.

700
01:52:46,943 --> 01:52:48,683
Louie?

701
01:52:52,765 --> 01:52:54,425
Louie?

702
01:52:57,562 --> 01:52:59,454
Are you all right?

703
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:24,900
Pick up!

704
01:55:00,034 --> 01:55:01,974
Lift it.

705
01:55:04,055 --> 01:55:05,829
Lift it!

706
01:55:35,987 --> 01:55:38,130
Over your head.

707
01:56:02,972 --> 01:56:05,175
If he drops it

708
01:56:05,275 --> 01:56:06,389
shoot him.

709
01:58:03,534 --> 01:58:05,825
Come on, Louie.

710
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:07,764
Come on, boy.

711
01:58:13,002 --> 01:58:14,893
Come on, Louie.

712
01:59:13,788 --> 01:59:15,858
