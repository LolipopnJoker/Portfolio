1
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,950
Gangland enforcers broke the arms

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,160
of an elderly news dealer
this afternoon,

3
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,288
when he refused to share
his week's receipts with them.

4
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,666
Stacks of newspapers
were tossed in the gutter,

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,586
as the thugs wrecked the business
and made their getaway.

6
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,632
Lunchtime crowds were paralyzed
by the suddenness of the crime.

7
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,385
Not a hand was raised in protest.

8
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,475
Organized crime is their name.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,602
What appeared to be organized hoods

10
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,604
shattered the kneecaps
of the beloved operator

11
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,358
of a shoeshine parlor today,
as horrified customers looked on.

12
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,527
The bootblack would not
give up his receipts,

13
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,447
and paid dearly for his failure
to surrender to gang demands.

14
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,657
A mother offour,
unable to pay a gambling debt,

15
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,992
lies dead tonight.

16
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,578
Gangland thugs left her
to expire in a pool of blood,

17
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,372
as they helped themselves
to the contents of a cash register

18
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,666
in her son's luncheonette.

19
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,943
I was talkin' to them
at the station house,

20
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,571
and it was the darnedest thing
I ever saw...

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,868
Five, no help. King, no help.

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,747
- Aces and eights.
- Twenty.

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, I'm callin' it.

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,254
Deuce, still possible. Six, no help.

25
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,216
Pair of aces, pair of eights.

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,260
Okay, the ace bets.

27
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,722
- Hey! Little Face!
- What's the trouble?

28
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,351
Come on, let's go!
Ace bets five.

29
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:24,435
I call.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,812
- Six.
- See ya.

31
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,188
What's that?

32
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,694
Cat.

33
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,282
Aw, a little kitty.

34
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,451
Hi, little fella!

35
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,371
Let's go.

36
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,624
- Ace bets five.
- I'm callin'.

37
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,626
I'm in.

38
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,670
Six.
You got a possible straight.

39
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:54,048
Queen. Eight. Pair of eights.

40
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,844
Nine, no help. Jack, no help.

41
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,428
King, no help.

42
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,350
Well, Little Face?

43
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:26,497
See what you can find.
I wanna leave a little message here.

44
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,810
Calling Dick Tracy. Calling Dick Tracy.

45
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,146
- Come in, Pat. This is Tracy.
- What is that?

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,189
We got five dead men
at the Seventh Street Garage,

47
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,651
and nobody knows who they are.
You better get over here right away.

48
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,486
I'm on my way.

49
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,658
I'll be back.
I wanna know how it comes out.

50
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:03,784
Excuse me. Excuse me.

51
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:04,911
- Ow!
- Sorry.

52
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,419
- Hello, boys.
- Tracy!

53
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,837
Tracy, are we glad to see you.

54
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,757
Tracy, whoever they are,
they're all dead.

55
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,680
Five dead men, Tracy.
And we don't even know who they are.

56
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,807
Whoever did it took their identification.

57
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,560
- But they didn't take a dime.
- Big Boy Caprice.

58
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,440
Everything all right, Tracy?

59
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,151
Fine, fine.
Just a little trouble downtown.

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,277
Tracy,
they're saying that Big Boy's

61
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,445
got the city out of control.

62
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,781
What about this rumor
they're movin' you up to chief of police?

63
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,449
We've already got an excellent
chief of police, Bert.

64
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,951
Why don't you shave off
that silly moustache?

65
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,285
How 'bout runnin' for mayor, Tracy?

66
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,287
I'm a cop, Charlie.
I don't want to take a demotion.

67
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,081
Hey, McNally,
I want a copy of that shot.

68
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,165
You got it, Tess.

69
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,667
They're sayin' Big Boy's got
the city out of control!

70
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,043
Still can't get anything on him, huh?

71
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,254
Don't let them get to you, Tracy.
You'll get Big Boy.

72
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,216
Big Boy's on the street and they want
to stick me behind a desk?

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,593
They believe in you, Tracy.
They think if you're chief of police,

74
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,387
the city'll be safe!

75
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,847
Tess, there's about as much chance
of me gettin' behind a desk

76
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,933
as there is of me gettin' a new girlfriend.

77
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,646
Sooner or later you're gonna decide.

78
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:20,069
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide.

79
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:27,118
Baby, it's time
So why waste it in chatter?

80
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,204
Let's settle.

81
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,375
The matter.

82
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,378
Baby, you're mine on a platter

83
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:43,718
I always get my man

84
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,309
I'm gonna love you
like nothin' you've known

85
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,899
I'm gonna love you
and you all alone.

86
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,573
Sooner is better than later
But lover

87
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,326
I'll hover

88
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,621
I'll plan.

89
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,210
This time I'm not only getting
I'm holding.

90
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:22,048
My man.

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,389
Bad news on the garage, Lips.

92
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,435
They've bumped them all off.
Our men are getting very nervous.

93
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,023
- Champagne, Miss Mahoney?
- Breathless,

94
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,984
that was beautiful, as always.

95
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,278
I'm so happy you liked it.

96
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,991
- You mind if I leave?
- Why?

97
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,410
I get sick when you eat.

98
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,621
You didn't used to.

99
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,539
You didn't used to be a zeppelin.

100
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,249
- Your devotion is touching.
- Lips!

101
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,710
Lips! It's a raid! It's the cops!

102
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,462
Lips Manlis, you're under arrest,

103
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,756
for owning and operating
a gambling establishment.

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,092
- Yeah? Where's your warrant?
- Right here. Let's go.

105
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,596
- You, too, Breathless.
- I wasn't gamblin', I was singin'.

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,015
- Get in the car.
- Flattop.

107
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,477
- These ain't cops!
- Who are they?

108
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,522
Hiya, Lips. Hiya, Breathless. Let's go.

109
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,461
Even Chief Brandon says
you'd make a wonderful chief of police.

110
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,546
It's a desk job.

111
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,047
What's so bad
about a desk job, anyway?

112
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,800
You think if you sit at a desk,
you're playin' it safe.

113
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,219
If you weren't out in the street
every night, risking your neck,

114
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,596
you could have a wife. I mean a life!

115
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,475
Nobody's gonna put Big Boy Caprice
behind bars sittin' behind a desk.

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,978
Tracy, you said you were going
to take a day off tomorrow.

117
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,229
Hmm?

118
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,732
Come on.

119
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,152
- Tracy, did you say you were gonna...
- Sure...

120
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,489
Hey, kid. What's your hurry?
Where are ya goin'?

121
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,242
- Stop him! Hey, stop!
- Take it easy.

122
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,703
- He stole my watch!
- Hey, kid?

123
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,330
- Stop that boy! Stop that boy.
- Hey, hey, kid!

124
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,583
Come here!
Did you steal this man's watch?

125
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,669
Hi, Tess.

126
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,255
The rest of my party should
be arriving any minute.

127
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,219
Come on, kid. You're makin' a mistake.

128
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:36,557
It's only a watch! You don't wanna
get yourself in this kind of trouble!

129
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,437
Hey! What are ya tryin' to do?

130
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,105
You're gonna get hurt, kid!

131
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,233
Be careful! You're gonna get hurt!

132
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,343
- What did you get?
- Didn't save me no chicken.

133
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,011
Things is tough.

134
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,898
- That's all?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,737
Hey, tough guy. Want to try that
on somebody your own size?

136
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,672
Maybe we should step outside.

137
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,929
Okay, tough guy. Now do you want
to give the kid a piece of chicken?

138
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,391
We got a place for people
who beat up kids.

139
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:04,603
- This cockroach your old man?
- Go suck an egg.

140
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,711
Look what you did
to your pretty tuxedo.

141
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,507
- Big Boy, ain't we pals?
- No pals in this business, Lips.

142
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,677
You taught me that. Sign it.

143
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,096
- The deed to the Club Ritz!
- That's right.

144
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,223
I'm goin' into show business now.

145
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,812
You're dirty, Lips. You need a bath.

146
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,816
Not the bath! Not the bath!
Big Boy, not the bath!

147
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,208
- Hey. You got a name?
- Kid.

148
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,045
- Kid?
- Kid.

149
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,339
What's the name your mother
and father gave ya?

150
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,507
What mother and father?

151
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,678
- Who takes care of you?
- Who takes care of you?

152
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,765
This is Moriarty.
I'm at the Southside Warehouse.

153
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,850
- Do you read me?
- Repeat, Moriarty.

154
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,061
- You're at the Southside Warehouse?
- Right.

155
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,023
I don't know who they are,
and I can't see what goin' on inside.

156
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,608
The car was unmarked...

157
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:39,323
Big Boy, we're friends! Not the bath!
Not the bath! We're friends!

158
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,700
I know, and I'm gonna miss ya.

159
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,328
But, "All's fair in love and business."

160
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,537
Benjamin Franklin.

161
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,706
Big Boy. Big Boy, Big Boy.
Think about it.

162
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,999
How could you do this to me?

163
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,793
- You.
- Me?

164
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,961
- How do you want it?
- Want it?

165
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,799
Allow me. If a woman don't wear mink,

166
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,801
she don't wear nothin'.

167
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,513
Well, I look good both ways.

168
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,057
Mumbles! Wipe it off.

169
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,197
All right! Put the word out!

170
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,325
Lips' territory is my territory now.

171
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,371
Everyone who worked for him
is workin' for me!

172
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,083
Everything he owned, I own!

173
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,544
Let's get outta here.

174
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,046
Cover that trapdoor!

175
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,432
You are my lucky charm.

176
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,309
With you here on my arm.

177
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,353
Well, we gotta call
the Welfare Society. Hey, Mike.

178
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,564
Wait. The what?

179
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,443
The boy's home. Mike?
You got any ice cream?

180
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,445
- Hey!
- Let me go!

181
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,196
Hey, where are you goin'?
What are you doing?

182
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,824
You ain't stickin' me in no orphanage.
I've been there!

183
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,452
Hey, come on. Sit down. Sit down.

184
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,037
I'm very sorry, pal.
It's the law. Sit down.

185
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,624
Look, Kid, if you don't have
a home with a mother and a father,

186
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,502
you go to the orphanage, it's the law!

187
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,504
Hey, Mike. You got any ice cream?

188
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,506
Calling Dick Tracy. Calling Dick Tracy.

189
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,967
Bring the Kid some ice cream.
Come in, Sam.

190
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,303
Southside Warehouse,
on the river, Tracy.

191
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,181
Somethin's goin' on.
You better get down here.

192
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,017
I'm on my way.

193
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,187
Hey, Tracy,
what about the eating machine?

194
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,813
Huh? Oh.

195
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,648
Can you watch him or somethin'?

196
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,858
Watch him do what?

197
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,235
Uh...

198
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,989
Well,

199
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,410
take him to my place.
I'll tell Pat to call the orphanage.

200
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,502
- You two married?
- No.

201
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,212
Would you like a broken arm?

202
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,595
- I don't like dames.
- Good. Me neither.

203
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,401
- Walnuts!
- Walnuts?

204
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,322
Tracy, there's a widow to whom a few
words need to be said in bereavement.

205
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,200
Pat, bring in Flattop and Itchy.
Sam, get these fingerprinted.

206
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,453
- Flattop and Itchy? For what?
- I wanna find Lips Manlis fast.

207
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,830
- With a handful of walnuts?
- Yeah, with a handful of walnuts?

208
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,165
Walnuts?

209
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,384
All right, all right, all right.

210
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,718
Hello, gentlemen.

211
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,513
- Where's Lips Manlis?
- Who's Lips Manlis?

212
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,557
Yeah, who's Lips Manlis?
We get to make one phone call,

213
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,849
that's the law.

214
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,351
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,645
Gimme the phone.

216
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,982
There's the phone. Be my guest.

217
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,901
Make a note, Pat.
They waived their right to a phone call.

218
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,987
- Right, Tracy.
- Hey, copper.

219
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,074
Maybe you ought to look before
you leap, huh? We got rights.

220
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,368
Take the bad men away.
They scare me.

221
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,538
- Up and at 'em. Get outta here.
- We got rights, too, you know?

222
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,082
- Take your story walkin', Itchy.
- See you around, Tracy, huh?

223
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,543
- Come on!
- All right, all right.

224
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,420
- Get your mitts off me.
- Can't do this, Tracy.

225
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,755
The D.A.'ll say
you're badgering witnesses.

226
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,549
Get me Mumbles.

227
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,013
You have no right to do that.

228
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,307
Hello, Mumbles.

229
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,938
- Where's Lips Manlis?
- I don't know...

230
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,817
Where's Lips Manlis?

231
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,778
Got my diamonds, got my yacht.

232
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,946
Yacht!

233
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,282
Got a guy I adore.

234
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,659
"A guy I adore!"
Let's hear it! Let's hear it!

235
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,370
I'm so happy with what I got.

236
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,663
Come on! Let's go.

237
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:57,789
I want more!

238
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,041
Stretch it, stretch it!

239
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,043
"More!" They want, "More!"

240
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,795
Count your blessings.

241
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,213
"Count your blessings!"

242
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,757
One, two, three

243
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,718
I just hate keeping score

244
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,803
"I hate keeping score," let's show it!

245
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,472
Move it, touch it! Touch it, I want it!

246
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,557
Any number is fine with me.

247
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,767
Grab it! More!

248
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,644
As long as it's more.

249
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,479
More! Let's go!

250
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,482
Come on! More! Good!

251
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,318
More! More!

252
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,862
If you've got a little, why not a lot?

253
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,406
Add a bit and it'll get to be a oodle.

254
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,283
Everyjot and tittle adds to the pot.

255
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,409
Gotta pick it up!

256
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,495
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle.

257
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,663
More!

258
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,789
Up! Up!

259
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,998
Come on, up! More! Higher!

260
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,166
More!

261
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,292
Let's go!

262
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,919
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

263
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,879
lf it's gonna rain, let it pour.

264
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,215
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

265
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,176
lf you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many much more?

266
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,595
"Would you like a penny much more?"

267
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,933
Or does that sound too greedy?

268
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,687
That's not greed, no indeedy.

269
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,980
That's just stocking the store.

270
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,732
That's just stocking the store.

271
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,609
Give it to me!

272
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,531
Hmm.

273
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,914
Mumbles? Where's Lips Manlis?

274
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,291
That's what's soothing about excess.

275
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,669
Kick it up! Kick it up!

276
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,962
Come on. Down in front!

277
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,091
Never settle for something less.

278
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:35,178
Something's better than nothing, yes!

279
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,725
But nothing's better than more.

280
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,018
More.

281
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,563
More! More! More! More!

282
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,565
More! More! More!

283
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:51,111
No! No! It's wrong!
It's off, it's wrong! It doesn't work!

284
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,239
- It's not good. What?
- Boss! Boss!

285
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,575
I'm sorry. These girls are tired.

286
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,077
Yeah, we been doin' it all night.
It's 2:00 a.m.

287
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,330
It's 2:00 a.m.?
I'm about to turn this dump

288
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,168
into the birthplace
of a new era in entertainment!

289
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,170
You're tellin' me it's 2:00 a.m.?

290
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,172
Play the piano!

291
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,759
Hey! That was a silly thing to do.
He's the best piano player in town.

292
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,302
Shut up!

293
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,680
Come here.

294
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,725
Next time I take his fingers,
and I turn them into pretzels.

295
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,563
I just might do
the same thing to your face.

296
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,654
See? He's playin' better already.

297
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,448
Let's go.

298
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,450
From the toppy-top!

299
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,827
From the top!

300
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,540
Care for some water? I'm thirsty.

301
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:57,886
Where's Lips Manlis?

302
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:14,152
You heard it, Mrs. Green.
That's his testimony.

303
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,112
- Okay, boys. Get his out of here.
- His what?

304
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,909
Hey, hey! Wrong way, Mumbles.

305
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,084
That's coercion, Tracy.
Even if you get anything, it's illegal.

306
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,168
Just tell those boys in the lab.

307
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,003
Fingerprint those walnuts
by 8:00 in the morning,

308
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,088
'cause I'm gonna bring
Big Boy in tonight.

309
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,172
You what?

310
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,800
- That's the fifth time!
- It's a gamble, if you can't make it stick.

311
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,469
Let me tell you what the gamble is,
leavin' Big Boy on the street.

312
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,304
Let's go get him.

313
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,100
No indeedy
That's just stocking...

314
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,476
Hello, Big Boy.

315
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,853
I brought your garbage.

316
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,020
- Tracy!
- We meet again, huh?

317
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,232
- Where's Lips?
- This is a private club, copper.

318
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,526
- You got a membership card? I own it!
- Do you?

319
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,862
- Since when?
- Today.

320
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,614
- I made a deal with Lips.
- Lips!

321
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:03,368
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Must have left town.

322
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,537
Well, that's a coincidence.

323
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,707
My new girl, Breathless Mahoney,
meet Dick Tracy.

324
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,709
A servant of the people. Like me.

325
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,212
- You like walnuts, don't you, Big Boy?
- I love them!

326
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,590
A lot of people like walnuts.
They're good for the liver.

327
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,592
Yeah. But they're bad for the brain.

328
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,553
You're sloppy, Big Boy.
You're under arrest.

329
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,306
Get him outta here, boys.
We got a nice place for him to sleep,

330
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,600
- where they don't serve walnuts.
- Half hour, boss.

331
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,393
You'll be back
before the opening number, boss.

332
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,564
This ain't no break!
Keep rehearsin'! Get the lawyer.

333
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,025
- See ya in a half hour, boss.
- Tell him this flatfoot is at it again.

334
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,484
He's got no case.

335
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,002
Hello?

336
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,962
You're breaking
and entering, you know.

337
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,091
- Sorry.
- Sit down.

338
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,350
Aren't you gonna arrest me?

339
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,560
If I were gonna arrest you,
I'd have done it by now.

340
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,522
Then what are you up to, honey?

341
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,068
I think Lips Manlis is dead.

342
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,862
And I want you to tell me who killed him.

343
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,908
Or maybe you weren't on his side.

344
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,412
- Whose side are you on?
- The side I'm always on.

345
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,624
- Mine.
- No grief for Lips?

346
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,544
I'm wearing black underwear.

347
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,967
You know, it's legal for me
to take you down to the station

348
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,802
and sweat it out of you under the lights.

349
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,554
I sweat a lot better in the dark.

350
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,688
I know how you feel. You don't know
if you want to hit me or kiss me.

351
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:59,109
- I get a lot of that.
- Look, you're safe. Big Boy's in jail.

352
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,153
You're the one that can keep him there.
Give me a call.

353
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,838
You can do a little two-step

354
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,090
I'll go anywhere that you step to.

355
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,260
'Cause now I'm followin' you.

356
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:32,350
My feet might be falling out of rhythm.

357
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,394
Don't know what
I'm doin' with them, but...

358
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,770
My gosh! What time is it?

359
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,605
It's 6:30.

360
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,317
I have to get to the greenhouse.
Got those delphiniums comin' in.

361
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,821
Pat says he's gonna call
the orphanage today.

362
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,782
- Tracy, you might try waterin' those.
- Tess!

363
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,992
Mmm-hmm?

364
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,952
Thanks for watchin' the Kid.

365
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,496
- 'Night, Tracy.
- And Tess?

366
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,001
You know you're one in a million?

367
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:03,173
Romance is in the picture too
Now I'm followin' you

368
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,096
Tracy, good night.

369
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,349
By the way, Tracy. Have a good sleep.

370
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:17,395
Rompin', rompin'
Stompin', I'm rompin'

371
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,814
Rompin', stompin'
I'm rompin'

372
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,151
Rompin', stompin' all day.

373
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,248
- Tried the iodine transfer?
- Yes, Tracy.

374
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,250
- The silver nitrate?
- Twice.

375
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,920
Big Boy Caprice's fingerprints
are not on those walnuts, Tracy.

376
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,172
Well, I had to take the gamble.
What is it, Sam?

377
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,424
Tess is waiting. Boy's Department,
Marshall and Bradbury.

378
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,885
She says she's not going to go for
a drive in the country with that Kid

379
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,721
if he's wearin' the clothes he has on.
They stink.

380
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:56,267
Police brutality, boys.
And this is the fifth time.

381
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,269
Lucky for me, I don't bruise easily.

382
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,731
Mr. Caprice, do you intend to take legal
action against the city for false arrest?

383
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,400
Why should I blame the city
for something one man is doing?

384
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,986
This Tracy character is unstable.
The city should get rid of him.

385
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,155
You mean,
if you don't get rid of him first.

386
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,615
Who said that?

387
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,451
Hey, there's Fletcher!

388
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,287
"Law without order is as great
a danger to the people

389
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,082
"as order without law." Jefferson.

390
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,960
How can I support
a maverick police detective

391
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,462
who keeps making false arrests
of private citizens

392
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,464
and throwing them in jail?

393
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,133
Tracy, I am District Attorney.

394
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,259
Tracy, Tess can't get the Kid

395
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,970
- to take off these smelly clothes.
- Chief!

396
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:35,390
I am a candidate for mayor.
If you can't control Detective Tracy,

397
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,517
you'll just have to take him off duty.

398
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,020
Or I'll have to prosecute him,
and take you off duty.

399
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:45,066
Tracy, Tess is havin' a terrible
time with this Kid. What should I do?

400
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,404
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here! Come on!

401
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,990
You don't have to wear
what Tess tells you to wear.

402
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,825
Come here.

403
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,326
Where are you goin'?
What are you runnin' away from?

404
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,452
I don't need no suit.

405
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,454
- A suit's for school.
- School?

406
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,499
You can't fool me.
That means the orphanage.

407
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,667
I ain't wearin' no suit.

408
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,670
Kid, your clothes don't smell
very good, okay?

409
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,549
If you don't want to wear a suit, just go
back in there and say you don't want to.

410
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,759
Otherwise, pick the suit you like.

411
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,015
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

412
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,020
Just we two, flyin' high and hidin'

413
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,023
Up in a tree
Live alone and like it.

414
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:29,903
That's the answer for me
Don't come out of that tree.

415
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,990
Get your mitts off of me.
I can do it myself!

416
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,575
Young man! Ow!

417
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,993
Get outta here.

418
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,536
The young man will be out in a moment.

419
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,039
All right. When do we eat?

420
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,542
Live alone and like it
Free as the birds in the trees.

421
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,793
When do we eat?

422
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:48,296
High above the briars
Live alone and like it

423
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,840
I do whatever I please.

424
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,675
When do we eat?

425
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,345
When my heart desires
Free to hang around or fly.

426
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,138
At any old time.

427
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,431
When do we eat?

428
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:03,228
No equivocation
Most of all, no guarantees.

429
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,147
That's my only motto
Free of obligations.

430
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,066
Only the murmuring breeze.

431
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,150
When do we eat?

432
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:12,237
As an obbligato
Live alone and like it.

433
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,490
Why is that such a crime?

434
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,409
Free to call the tune.

435
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,412
Free to say if I'm gonna work or play

436
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,623
I can have the moon.

437
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,585
But I don't have to have it
Night and day.

438
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,004
Anyway
What I like is gliding.

439
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,049
Where the wind takes me to
Flyin' high and hidin'

440
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,094
Up in a tree
Live alone and like it.

441
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,013
That's the answer for me.

442
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:41,015
Don't come out of that tree.

443
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,935
That's the answer for me.

444
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,186
Nice day.

445
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,939
Yeah.

446
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,115
What?

447
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,621
- I been thinkin', Tess.
- What about?

448
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,292
- Well, you livin' alone...
- I like living alone.

449
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,877
- Huh?
- You know that. I'm not the lonely type.

450
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,339
Well,

451
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,633
that's something we got in common.

452
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,593
Yup, we have that in common.

453
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,555
Well, don't you think that
since we have so much in common,

454
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,559
it might be a good idea if we just

455
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,730
- went ahead and...
- Yes?

456
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,778
Well...

457
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,255
Look, I wasn't thinkin'
about you livin' alone,

458
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,842
as much as I was thinkin'
about me livin' alone.

459
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,928
- I mean...
- Hey, Tracy, watch out!

460
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,981
- Tracy, wait!
- You all right, Kid?

461
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,025
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Thanks for the tip.

462
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,569
- Who was it, Tracy?
- I don't know, Kid.

463
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,238
- I thought we was goners.
- They're just tryin' to scare us.

464
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,866
- They're just tryin' to scare us.
- Jeez, this is incredible!

465
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,576
What are we waitin' for? Let's get them!

466
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,287
Let's get them! Come on, let's go.

467
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,874
We can still get them!
They took a right, I saw them!

468
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,125
I'm sorry.

469
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,127
This is amazing, Tracy.
Come on! Let's go!

470
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,295
Tracy,

471
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,383
when you play in the street,
it's part of the game, I know that.

472
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,259
Just don't ask me to like it.

473
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,303
Come on! Let's go!

474
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,187
They headed up towards Main Street.

475
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,439
Who was it, Tracy?

476
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,734
I don't know, boys. Do me a favor.
Stick around here, will ya?

477
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,820
Sure, Tracy.

478
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,690
...police have been so wrong

479
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,191
in their search for the perpetrators

480
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,736
and the citizens of the peace-abiding
neighborhood are up in arms

481
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,738
over the clash of gunfire
that shattered the night.

482
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,453
Thanks for calling.

483
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,205
I was beginning to wonder
what a girl had to do to get arrested.

484
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,421
Well, wearin' that dress
is a step in the right direction.

485
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,226
Are you gonna make a move,
or do I have to do everything?

486
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:17,398
- I'm on duty.
- What's your day off?

487
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:18,816
Sunday.

488
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,736
It's a big world.
It must be Sunday somewhere.

489
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,996
Seem hot to you?

490
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,040
Hot?

491
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,714
Why did you call me here?

492
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,719
You know that car?

493
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,517
What I'm looking for is a driver.

494
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,810
Preferably one with some mileage.

495
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,064
Yeah?

496
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,656
I called you here 'cause I want
to know if you're ready to testify.

497
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,087
No?

498
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,057
You're right, Tracy.
Why would you get mixed up with me?

499
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,726
I'm a cheap floozy to you.

500
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,020
I'll be lucky if I get
through the week alive.

501
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,690
They probably followed me here.

502
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:48,406
It isn't easy, Tracy.
You want to throw me in jail?

503
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,824
Go ahead.

504
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Let's dance.

505
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,005
Watch the Kid.

506
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,425
You can do a little two-step

507
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,261
I'll go anywhere that you step to.

508
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,097
'Cause now I'm followin' you.

509
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:19,520
My feet might be falling out of rhythm.

510
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,315
Don't know what I'm doin' with them.

511
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,359
But I know I'm followin' you.

512
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,671
I remember all of ya
from when I was nothin'.

513
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,966
Pruneface, you tossed a firebomb
in my car one night,

514
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,469
give me a lot of trouble, but I forgive ya.

515
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,305
Mocca, you put three slugs
into me, but I lived.

516
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,433
I forgive you, too. I owe everybody
at this table a little something.

517
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,019
But I forgive all of you. Why?

518
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,273
Because I put the past in the past.

519
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:08,194
However, a boss
who cannot see the future

520
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,863
becomes a liability
to everyone concerned.

521
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,407
What are ya, a fortune teller?
What do you mean, the future?

522
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,162
Pruneface, what I mean

523
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,206
is the future is me.

524
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,876
Pat, Sam, come in. This is Tracy.

525
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,086
I followed her to the Club Ritz.

526
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,463
It looks like we got every hood in town
in one room.

527
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,507
Pruneface, Flattop, Johnny Ramm...

528
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,802
- Those guys hate each other!
- Better get over here, fast.

529
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,763
- L gotta find out why they're together.
- All right, let's go.

530
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:39,600
Baby, you're mine on a platter

531
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,186
I always.

532
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,439
Get my...

533
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,740
We got a problem with
organization. We're all split up.

534
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,367
That's bad business.

535
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,078
While we're divided,
the cops can keep us under control.

536
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:03,624
But use your imaginations.
We form this big company, see?

537
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:08,087
Each of us here at the table
are on the board of directors.

538
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,756
- I'm Chairman of the Board.
- Why you?

539
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,469
Because I have a vision.

540
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,014
A big boss must have a vision.

541
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:23,144
We got a town with thousands
of small stores and businesses.

542
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,437
People who are working real hard.

543
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,814
I think they should be workin' real hard.
For us.

544
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:32,236
Because we are for the people.

545
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,156
"And if you ain't for the people,

546
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,074
"you can't buy the people."

547
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,325
Lincoln.

548
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,371
We will become
the people's silent partner.

549
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:47,168
Every time some citizen buys a pound
of hamburger, we get a nickel.

550
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,046
Every time some guy gets a haircut,
we get a dime.

551
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,216
We'll dress like bankers.
Join the Rotary Club.

552
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,513
- Together, we will own this town.
- Why you?

553
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,769
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

554
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,021
When do we kill Dick Tracy?

555
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,608
As you know,
if anything happens to Tracy,

556
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,777
I'm the prime suspect.

557
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,614
- Leave Dick Tracy to me.
- I say we kill Tracy now.

558
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,699
- You say?
- I say.

559
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,786
I say you say nothing. I say,

560
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,663
you get behind me, we all profit.

561
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,625
You challenge me, we all go down!

562
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:33,130
There was one Napoleon,
one Washington, one me!

563
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,716
I'm out.

564
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,303
It only works if we're all in.

565
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,432
Then it don't work.

566
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:49,021
I got a good business.
I'll take my chances alone.

567
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,860
Let him go, let him go.
It's still a free country.

568
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,950
Maybe he'll have a change of heart.

569
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,163
Sam, I'm worried about Tracy.

570
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,666
What would it take to make you
go off your trolley?

571
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,835
Not me. I'm not the type.

572
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,419
Tracy, you crazy?

573
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,504
You don't have a search warrant.

574
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,797
If you don't get off that ledge,

575
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,507
do you have any idea
what the D.A. will do to you?

576
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,884
- This is Pat. Come on down.
- Just be ready to get me out of here.

577
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,056
Who's that? Spaldoni?

578
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,518
I think that's Spaldoni leaving.

579
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,063
If any of those bums find you,
the chief'll never forgive ya.

580
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,857
Come on, Tracy, get off that building.
If they catch ya,

581
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,525
they got a perfect right
to do whatever they...

582
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:36,986
- Great Scot!
- Great Scot!

583
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,832
Very upsetting.

584
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,171
Go, Sam. Get him!

585
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,902
Peppermint. Try some.

586
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,659
You know, Tracy, for a tough guy,
you do a lot of pansy things.

587
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,870
Is that right?

588
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,415
- Who is it?
- Mr. Tracy?

589
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,626
- Who is it?
- I'm Mrs. Skaff.

590
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,212
- I'm from the Welfare Department.
- The Welfare Department?

591
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,756
I'm afraid we're going
to have to take

592
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,424
the little boy to the orphanage.

593
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,844
Well, just give me
one minute, Mrs. Skaff.

594
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,765
I hope you understand,
Mr. Tracy. As a single man,

595
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,769
you can't just pick up a child
from the streets and take him home.

596
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,896
- He belongs in an orphanage.
- Mrs. Skaff, let's discuss this.

597
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,651
It's the law. Then he has to be
processed through proper channels.

598
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,986
- And then we have to...
- Mrs. Skaff, if you'll leave

599
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,114
this situation to me, I think you'll...

600
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,952
- We don't want no kid, copper.
- Yeah, we don't want no kid, copper.

601
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,703
Get dressed.

602
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,963
Come on. Get in there or I'll plug you.

603
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,256
Yeah, come on.

604
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,900
Glad you could join us, Tracy.

605
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,485
We thought you'd be
much more comfortable

606
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,569
meeting us here in the basement

607
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,864
of your girlfriend's apartment building,
while she's away at work.

608
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,409
You know, Dick...
You mind if I call you Dick?

609
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,078
My associates here

610
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,123
would very much like to see you
have a little accident.

611
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,500
But I tell them, "No."

612
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,920
"I'll take care of Tracy myself,"
I tell them.

613
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,673
You know why?

614
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,175
I want you on my side!

615
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,094
And let me tell you what my side is.

616
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:12,933
My side is a lifetime of action
and adventure, with no clock to punch.

617
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,602
It's treating that gal of yours 100%.

618
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:20,107
She should be treated like a princess,
protected like a baby.

619
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,026
You gonna put
all that money down there?

620
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,403
Fifteen thousand clams.

621
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,868
- It's a deal.
- Fifteen thousand clams.

622
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,621
Welcome to new orders, Dick.
We're gonna run one hell of a ship

623
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,623
with you aboard.

624
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,251
There's a big world out there,
and it's up for sale!

625
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,212
All of it. All we gotta do

626
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:46,216
is to make sure that the people know
I'm the one big enough to run it.

627
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:51,722
And that you are guilty of attempting
to bribe an officer of the law.

628
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,349
- Hey, hey!
- Not so fast, copper.

629
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,978
- You dumb dick!
- Let's give it to him!

630
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,315
Okay, boys. Do it!
You have just said good-bye

631
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,317
to oxygen!

632
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,695
You silly, stupid cop.

633
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,822
You refused me.

634
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:11,909
I offer you the keys to a kingdom,

635
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,912
and you tell me you're
an officer of the law!

636
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,665
I am the law! Me!

637
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,504
Boys, you guarantee me that this
is going to look like an accident.

638
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,799
Don't disappoint me. So long, sucker.

639
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,134
You should have made the deal.

640
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:33,722
Yeah. You're gonna have
one terrible accident, Tracy.

641
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,933
I don't even think
they're gonna find your body.

642
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,727
- Dumb dick.
- I didn't think Tracy'd take a bribe.

643
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:44,525
Ouch! This accident's been waitin'
to happen all day, Tracy.

644
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,777
You sure you don't want
to change your mind?

645
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,206
I guess
that's the end of Dick.

646
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,624
Thirty seconds, no more Dick.

647
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,210
Thirty seconds, no more Dick!

648
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,091
Hey, Tracy!

649
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,680
Kid! Get outta there!
Get away from there!

650
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,234
The furnace is gonna explode!

651
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,904
Get outta here, Kid. Get outta here.

652
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,620
Sit tight, Tracy. I'll get you out of here!

653
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,517
Hit the dirt!

654
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,869
Jeez, Tracy, that was a lot of dough.

655
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,413
You're all right, Kid.

656
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,540
"For action
in the face of grave danger,

657
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,585
"the Kid," whose name will be
filled in when he thinks of one,

658
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:31,298
"is awarded this Honorary Detective
certificate, with badge."

659
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,468
- Congratulations, pal.
- The best-lookin' officer on the force.

660
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,387
- With or without a name.
- But this is just a temporary certificate,

661
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:40,390
- till you pick a name for yourself.
- What's the matter with "Kid"?

662
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,643
Nothin'. This means no more
jumpin' on the back of cars.

663
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,686
- Got it?
- Tracy.

664
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,813
When does this
become permanent?

665
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,981
I got a badge for you.

666
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,275
- When he picks a name.
- What do you mean?

667
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,944
Look in your top drawer.

668
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,071
You already got the makings
of a detective.

669
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,906
Chief, it's temporary
till he picks a name, huh?

670
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,282
Sure, he'll pick a name.

671
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,284
Couple of years, this Kid'll be drivin'.

672
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,120
Maybe I'll make him my partner.

673
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,415
Sam, that's somethin'.
How'd ya like to pick your own name?

674
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:10,545
- Put her there, Detective.
- Know what I'd pick? I'd pick Sam.

675
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,424
What's that matter?
We're not paying you enough money?

676
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:19,096
Don't tell me about my boys
messin' up the Tracy rubout,

677
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,431
they were being tested, they flunked!

678
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,268
Now, they're just flunkies. Like you.

679
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,937
I don't care if Tracy
puts one and one together.

680
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,898
Don't matter to me.
You're still workin' for me!

681
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,484
You're on my side. You're not out.

682
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,196
You're not out.
When you are dead, then you are out.

683
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:39,199
You are mine. I own you.

684
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:04,725
Tracy, we've got 14 witnesses,

685
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,311
they all insist Big Boy
spent the entire morning

686
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,354
- at a dance lesson.
- Uh-huh.

687
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,690
I am sorry!

688
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,487
Be just a second, Tess.

689
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,664
- What kind of ice cream did you get?
- Fresh peach.

690
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:32,252
Better eat it right away.
It's starting to run a little.

691
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:41,887
What are you doin' here?

692
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,930
Aren't you gonna frisk me?

693
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:49,561
You're so good with names.
What's a name that you like?

694
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,189
I don't know.
Herbert. Horace. Thomas. Edgar.

695
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,399
Anything's better than "Kid." Hold this.

696
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,528
- Well, I like "Kid."
- If you want that detective certificate

697
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,572
to be permanent,
you gotta pick a name.

698
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,284
Gimme.

699
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:12,084
- She's pretty.
- She's a lot more than that.

700
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,224
Look, if I testify against Big Boy,
he'll have me bumped off.

701
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,810
He'd have to bump me off first.

702
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,812
Why?

703
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,981
Because, I'd be protecting you,
24 hours a day.

704
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,151
- You would?
- Yeah. That's my job.

705
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,488
Do you always put so much
of yourself in yourjob?

706
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,167
You're not gonna know that
till you testify.

707
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:00,048
You're a good man, Tracy.

708
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,884
And I want to do the right thing.

709
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,595
Come here.

710
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,274
Hey! What's the hurry?
Where's the fire?

711
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:21,361
Throwin' a ball in a trash can,
is that supposed to be some big...

712
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,995
Tess, this is...

713
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,498
I know who she is.
Hello, Miss Mahoney.

714
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,586
You must be Miss Trueheart.
Tracy's told me so much about you.

715
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,546
Oh?

716
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,840
He doesn't know
so awfully much about me.

717
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,598
Yeah, well, thanks for comin' by.

718
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,600
- We'll be in touch, Tracy.
- Right.

719
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,063
Miss Trueheart.

720
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:02,235
What a cute little boy.

721
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,495
I'll bet she does some
nifty undercover work.

722
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,955
Well, we're makin' our move
on the Club Ritz tonight.

723
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,876
Is this pistachio?

724
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,213
Now, that's what I call a dame.
What was she doin' here?

725
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,299
She knows something.
I'm tryin' to get her to testify.

726
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:27,552
You know what, Tracy?
You ought to let me talk to her.

727
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,389
Is this 88 Keys?

728
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:36,394
I got a deal for you. Meet me at
the city car barn in one hour.

729
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,772
That's right. One hour.

730
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,624
Up here, 88.

731
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,546
Open the suitcase.

732
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,924
Do you wanna know why I called you?

733
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,554
Five thousand. Your first payment.

734
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:14,558
- For what?
- You work for Big Boy now.

735
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:18,520
You want to make a lot
of money helpin' him?

736
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,481
- Yes or no?
- Yeah.

737
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,318
Give that letter to Big Boy,

738
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,363
tell him you found it under your door.

739
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,075
Who do I tell him you are?

740
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,205
You don't, because you never saw me.

741
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:41,167
And don't try to find me, I'll call you.

742
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,087
Make the deal.

743
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,723
"If you kill Dick Tracy,
you will be the prime suspect,

744
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,766
"and the city will mobilize against you.

745
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,352
"But for 10% of your business,
we guarantee.

746
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,563
"Dick Tracy will not be
a problem for you anymore,

747
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,608
"and you will not be
suspected of anything."

748
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,820
What can you lose?

749
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,948
If they don't deliver, you don't pay.

750
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,535
You're a piano player.
What do you want to be? A radish?

751
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,372
Don't bring me a deal
from someone you never saw,

752
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,832
you don't know how to get to.

753
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,543
Get him out of here.
Go ahead. Play the piano.

754
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:24,669
Okay, what's this?

755
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,171
I think I got this figured out.

756
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:29,174
Hey! Got a match?

757
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:32,177
- What was that all about?
- My income tax.

758
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,387
Hey!

759
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:42,020
- Come here.
- You want me to follow him?

760
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,565
Where? To the piano?

761
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:53,073
That was none of your business.
Come here. I'm your business.

762
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,367
Okay, Numbers,
let's see your numbers.

763
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,118
We get the same percentage
from the laundries...

764
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,208
Where do you think you're goin'?

765
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,710
Come on, Tracy. Take me with ya.

766
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,338
Get back in there and brush your teeth.

767
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,883
Go on. And wish me luck tonight.

768
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,180
I'll see you later.

769
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,145
Move in, and take your positions.

770
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:32,195
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine.

771
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:38,451
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine.

772
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,622
Baby, it's time that you face it

773
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:49,087
I always get my man.

774
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,175
I have to hand it to you, Big Boy,
you got the best broads in town!

775
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,635
Top drawer!

776
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,137
...you're gonna decide.

777
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:04,310
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide.

778
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,480
- Come in, Tracy.
- This is Tracy, Sam.

779
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,815
We made it.

780
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,277
...why waste it in chatter?

781
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,655
Careful, Tracy.
The waiters carry guns.

782
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,912
Baby, you're mine on a platter

783
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,540
I always get...

784
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,708
All right, Tracy. You all set?

785
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,877
Okay, boys. Let's go.

786
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,763
All right! I got it under control.

787
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,599
Relax! Please! Everybody?

788
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,101
It's okay. Please! Please. Okay!

789
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,562
No, no! I got it under control!

790
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:50,857
Everybody! No! Everything's under...

791
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,070
Just sit down, everything...
Relax. It's easy.

792
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:59,449
Get this thing taken care of.
It's okay. No, everything's all right.

793
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:12,295
Okay, Bill, that side of the room.
Frank, cover the bar.

794
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,256
Hello, Big Boy. The gang's all here.

795
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,384
- What is it, a class reunion?
- This is a private party, mister.

796
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,012
- Invitation only.
- Here's my invitation.

797
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,514
Search warrant.

798
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,144
And no one I've kissed, babe.

799
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:32,774
Ever fights me again.

800
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,162
- No gambling, no nothing, Tracy.
- What?

801
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:47,705
You mean,
you thought we had gambling?

802
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,375
I wouldn't be caught dead
in a place that permitted gambling!

803
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,584
I'll be back, Big Boy.

804
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:55,463
Listen, tell me when you're coming.
I'll have a big party waitin' for ya.

805
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,006
- Let's go, boys.
- Right, Tracy.

806
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:01,928
Then, baby, amen.

807
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,515
I thought you was gonna
take care of Tracy.

808
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,393
- He didn't look around. Did you notice?
- Yeah.

809
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:09,477
I don't get it.

810
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,603
He's just trying
to louse up the party.

811
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,731
- How'd it go?
- Clockwork.

812
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:18,695
Let's hope Big Boy thinks I'm too stupid
to look under the top of a table.

813
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,197
Pat, I am gonna get him.

814
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:23,700
It's just a question of when.

815
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:32,458
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine.

816
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,296
Baby, it's time that you faced it

817
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,634
I always get my man.

818
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,430
Get over to 132 Broad Street.

819
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,557
132 Broad Street.

820
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,934
- Okay, 132 Broad Street.
- Right, Bug.

821
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,396
The challenge delights me.

822
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,065
The more you resist, babe.

823
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,276
The more it excites me.

824
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,445
Dick Tracy has struck tonight,
and he has struck hard,

825
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,946
right at the heart
of the gang lord's empire.

826
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:08,995
No one I've kissed, babe
ever fights me again

827
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,752
lf you're on my list.

828
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:22,842
It's just a question of when.

829
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:30,516
When I get a yen.

830
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:38,066
Then, baby, Amen

831
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:45,114
I'm counting to ten

832
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,789
I'm gonna love you
like nothing you've known

833
00:54:55,501 --> 00:55:01,089
I'm gonna love you
and you all alone.

834
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:07,887
Sooner is better than later
But lover

835
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,598
I'll hover

836
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:15,395
I'll plan.

837
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,147
This time I'm not only getting

838
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,483
I'm holding.

839
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,527
My.

840
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:30,660
Man

841
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:37,792
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

842
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:42,547
Everywhere I turn,
it's Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

843
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:44,757
It's like he's reading my mind.

844
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,801
Texie Garcia,

845
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,096
Ribs Mocca, Johnny Ramm
and now DeSanto. I don't get it.

846
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,432
How could he catch them so fast?

847
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,475
I don't understand.
He knows what we're doing,

848
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,852
before we do it.

849
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,520
You said you had a way
of taking care of Tracy,

850
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,858
"Leave it to me," you said.
Well, let me tell you somethin'.

851
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:05,945
I'm taking this bum out of the headlines.
I'm rubbin' him out!

852
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,117
You kill Tracy, they point
the finger at me. This bum...

853
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,562
We're being bugged.

854
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:45,318
We're being bugged.

855
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,320
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

856
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,871
Hey, Mike, what'd you put in
this chili, melted rubber?

857
00:56:56,955 --> 00:57:01,501
Sometimes I wonder why I slave over
a hot stove for you, Tracy.

858
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:07,215
Okay, Freddy. Get down
to the Southside Warehouse.

859
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,299
Big payoff!

860
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,024
Tracy, I'm leaving.

861
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,698
I used to be afraid that maybe you'd
never take some time and settle down,

862
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,201
and now I know it.

863
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,247
I knew you'd never
want a desk job, Tracy.

864
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,957
Calling Dick Tracy. Calling Dick Tracy.

865
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,126
Do you read me, Tracy?

866
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:46,087
You got Big Boy on the run now,
and that's good.

867
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,465
Calling Dick Tracy.
Calling Dick Tracy.

868
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,802
Tracy, good luck.

869
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,930
Come in, Tracy. This is Bug Bailey.

870
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,932
Do you read me?

871
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,642
What is it, Bug?

872
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,019
There's something going on
at the Southside Warehouse.

873
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,398
- It sounds big, really big.
- Go on.

874
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,112
Tracy, come in.

875
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,282
Go on.

876
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,284
Tracy, are you there?

877
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,287
Better get over there, Tracy.

878
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,289
I'm on my way.

879
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,797
I'll be back, Tess.

880
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,124
Reload.

881
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:05,476
All right! All right, that's enough!

882
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,520
I want them dead! Both of them.

883
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,314
I want this no-face dead
and I want Tracy dead.

884
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,942
What's the matter?
You bums forgot how to kill people?

885
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,152
Doesn't your work mean
anything to you anymore?

886
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:18,239
Have you no sense
of pride in what you do?

887
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,701
No sense of duty? No sense of destiny?

888
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,703
I'm lookin' for generals!

889
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,247
What do I got? Foot soldiers!

890
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:29,375
I want Dick Tracy dead!

891
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,297
Don't get me wrong, Tracy.
If you say there was a man with no face,

892
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,465
I'll bet the mortgage there was.

893
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,634
- But who's he working for?
- Yeah, who's he workin' for?

894
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,094
I don't know, boys,
but I didn't dream him up.

895
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,806
Would you get my suit cleaned?
We need a witness who'll testify.

896
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,559
- A man with no face?
- A man with no face.

897
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,854
What can you lose, Big Boy?
What can you lose?

898
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:53,357
I don't know, Big Boy. It seems they
want to get rid of Tracy as much as you.

899
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:55,693
It'll only cost you 10%.
What can you lose?

900
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,362
Okay, piano player.

901
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,406
You got a deal.

902
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,577
Mike, give the Kid a donut.

903
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,455
- Hi, Tracy.
- Hi, Tracy.

904
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,998
- Hi, Tracy.
- Which one?

905
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,792
- Where's Tess?
- Out of town.

906
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,295
She asked me and the boys
to take care of the Kid

907
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,838
till they take him to the orphanage.

908
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,674
- There's no jelly in that donut.
- Tess went out of town, huh?

909
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,843
Sorry, Tracy, I thought you knew.

910
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,305
Want me to take the Kid
back to the precinct?

911
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:28,893
- No, Chief. Thanks a lot for fillin' in.
- Okay. Good night.

912
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,603
Good night.

913
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,817
Tracy. Want a donut?

914
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,696
Yeah, thanks.
Mike, let me have a coffee, will ya?

915
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,783
- Coffee.
- One for me, too.

916
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:47,787
What can you lose?

917
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,456
Maybe it shows.

918
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,958
She's had clues.

919
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,504
Which she chose to ignore.

920
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,757
Maybe, though, she knows.

921
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:05,513
And just wants to go on as before.

922
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,683
As a friend, nothing more.

923
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:14,438
So she closes the door.

924
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:21,028
Well, if she does.

925
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:25,658
Those are the dues.

926
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,244
- Once the words are spoken.
- Once the words are spoken.

927
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:30,287
- Something may be broken.
- Something may be broken.

928
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,998
- Still you love her.
- Still you love her.

929
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,627
- What can you lose?
- What can you lose?

930
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,797
But what ifshe goes?

931
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:43,175
At least now you have part of her.

932
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:48,222
- What if she had to choose?
- What if she had to choose?

933
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:53,519
Leave it alone.

934
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:57,231
Hold it all in.

935
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,276
- Better a bone.
- Better a bone.

936
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,820
- Don't even begin.
- Don't even begin.

937
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:07,533
- With so much to win.
- With so much to win.

938
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:11,370
- There's too much.
- There's too much.

939
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:19,170
- To lose.
- To lose.

940
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,592
Cheer up, Tracy. I'm the one in danger.

941
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,760
I shouldn't be talking to a cop.

942
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,388
- You know what I want.
- I want to hear you say it.

943
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,598
I don't want you to be hurt.

944
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:33,225
Don't tell me what you don't want.
Tell me what you do want.

945
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,063
You want me.

946
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,777
Don't you?

947
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,071
You're right, I do want you. In court,

948
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,448
- where you can tell the truth.
- You're lying.

949
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,159
You want me the same way
that I want you.

950
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,703
You want me to take a risk?
I want you to take a risk.

951
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,497
I told you I'd protect you if you testify.

952
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,956
- Protect me?
- It's my job.

953
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:59,502
I don't know about yourjob.
I only know what I feel.

954
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,087
If you can't tell me how you feel,
Tracy, then I can't trust you.

955
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,633
Wait a minute.
What do you want me to admit?

956
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:09,887
That I think about you? Okay, I admit it.

957
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,182
- Testify.
- You want my testimony?

958
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:17,478
Tell me you want me. If you do that,
I'll do anything you say.

959
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:21,690
How bad do you want Big Boy?
It's up to you.

960
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,193
Tell me you want me.

961
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:28,113
Tell me you want it all, but tell me now.

962
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,665
If I say that, I'm gonna hurt
somebody I don't wanna hurt.

963
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,466
You trust her.

964
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,974
I love her.

965
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,449
He could be
President of the United States,

966
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,618
and he'd call it a desk job.

967
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,371
Dick Tracy's awfully tough on himself.

968
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:21,625
He's torn, Tess.
He's torn between love and duty.

969
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,794
If you get too close to a man like that,

970
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,629
you probably won't be
treated much better

971
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,423
than he treats himself.

972
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,843
It takes a lot of understanding
to love a man like that.

973
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,762
What did you say, Mother?

974
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:37,349
I said, it takes a lot of understanding
to love a man like that.

975
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:48,110
He'll never take a desk job.

976
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,700
Yeah?

977
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,579
Sit down, will ya?

978
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,457
Sam, Mrs. Trueheart said
Tess left there a long time ago.

979
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:03,834
Has somebody checked out
Route 3 for accidents?

980
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,377
Right, Tracy.

981
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,005
We gotta talk about
this orphanage business.

982
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,007
- What?
- Tracy, did you get the sketch?

983
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,592
Yes, I got the sketch.
I got both sketches.

984
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,760
They're both the same sketch.

985
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,512
Forget the sketch!
Check Route 3 for accidents!

986
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,223
- We're working on it, Tracy.
- Don't work on it, do it!

987
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,976
- Right.
- Right.

988
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,980
I hope she comes back to him.
I've never seen him like this.

989
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,107
The Welfare Office called again.

990
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:30,319
I'm not supposed to keep you
out of the orphanage.

991
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:04,520
Yes, and then send
a letter to District Attorney Fletcher.

992
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,522
- Can you do it?
- Ah.

993
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:08,857
I can do anyone's handwriting.

994
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,193
All right. Tracy's handwriting, write this,

995
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,279
"District Attorney Fletcher,
I have evidence that will destroy you.

996
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:18,117
"Bring $10,000 to room 429,
Midway Hotel."

997
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,119
Bring $10,000

998
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:24,248
to room 429, Midway Hotel.

999
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:07,541
If you want to stay alive,
you'll do what Big Boy says.

1000
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:14,214
That's not it! That's not it! Does
Paddy O'Brien know she's missing?

1001
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,758
- Yeah. That's not him?
- Was he the one?

1002
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,552
That's not it! That's not it! What's that?

1003
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,429
- It's for you.
- Open it.

1004
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,264
Pat, what about that guy
from up north?

1005
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:24,433
You hear anything about him?
What's his name? Louie?

1006
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:27,102
- Yeah, Louie the Louse.
- Yeah, where is he?

1007
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,022
- He's in the pen, I think.
- I can't do it, Kid. It's the law.

1008
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,524
- Six months.
- Flowers.

1009
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,943
This is cold!

1010
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:38,071
Hey, who's on the coffee
out there, Rip Van Winkle?

1011
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,157
- You can't get a decent cup...
- I don't know why it'd be cold.

1012
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:48,123
Tess wants to talk. Watch the Kid, boys.

1013
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,958
Sure thing, Tracy.

1014
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:53,128
Tracy, you got lilies.
Want me to put them in water?

1015
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,130
Tracy? Tracy?

1016
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,902
I'm here to pick up a child, case 38196.

1017
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,988
I don't want to wait.
I want the child now.

1018
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,783
You're from the orphanage,
ma'am?

1019
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:26,328
Last night we had a date
We stayed out late

1020
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,498
I bought round after round.

1021
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,875
Just for you
I played the fool.

1022
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,294
Yes, I was quite the clown

1023
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,712
Tess, where are you?

1024
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,798
Words were spoken
Hearts were broken.

1025
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:39,925
But now I hope you see

1026
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,096
lt was the whiskey talkin'
Not me.

1027
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:50,227
I had myself a little splash...

1028
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,028
Tess?

1029
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,158
Tess! Tess.

1030
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,037
Relax, Tracy.

1031
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,499
Just smell the flowers, and go to sleep.

1032
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,711
It won't kill you. It won't even hurt you.

1033
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,756
But your big career is over.

1034
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,738
Hey!

1035
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,990
Close the darn door.

1036
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,999
Tracy, you're late. Wait a minute.

1037
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,793
Who are you?

1038
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,299
Mayor Tracy,
Senator Tracy, Governor Tracy.

1039
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,802
High political offices
are being coupled with Tracy's name.

1040
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,571
- Now?
- Now.

1041
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,992
"You can't blackmail me, Dick Tracy.

1042
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,454
"Nobody does that to me!
Nobody blackmails me!

1043
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,122
"You put that gun away!

1044
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,834
"Who do you think you're dealing with?
If I go to jail, you go to jail!

1045
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,963
"I don't have to pay you!
I don't have to give you a dime!

1046
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,507
"I don't have to give
you a nickel, Dick Tracy!

1047
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,426
"You're nothin' but a punk,
Tracy, that's all you are!"

1048
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:51,014
Police? Better send someone over
here right away. The Midway Hotel.

1049
01:11:51,099 --> 01:11:53,642
"Put it away! Put the gun away, Tracy!"

1050
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,483
Out.

1051
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,737
Go around back!

1052
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:25,257
Yes, there's bad news tonight.
It's worse than bad. It's heartbreaking.

1053
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,134
Dick Tracy is in disgrace tonight.

1054
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,636
Charges of blackmail and murder
fill the hushed air.

1055
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:33,223
And in the void, once more, is heard
the rattle of chips, as the wheel spins...

1056
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,935
This is beautiful.
I want to hang this on my wall.

1057
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,231
I've gotta hand it to ya, 88!
Your people did it!

1058
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,066
They got Tracy out of the way.

1059
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,693
Keep him out of the way.

1060
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:47,946
Boys, we're back in business!

1061
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,866
Maybe I'll run for mayor myself.

1062
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,207
Yesterday it seemed
the world was about to end.

1063
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,333
Didn't it?

1064
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:03,587
Looked as though
we wouldn't last out the year.

1065
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:06,590
Yesterday disaster
waited around the bend.

1066
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,633
Well, my friend.

1067
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,594
Spring is here.

1068
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:14,139
Back in business and ain't it grand?

1069
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:17,059
Let the good times roll.

1070
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,896
Yesterday things were out of hand.

1071
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,357
Now they're under control.

1072
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:28,653
Bye-bye, blues
So long, adversity.

1073
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,781
Happiness, hello.

1074
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:32,282
Hello, hello.

1075
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,826
Keep the status quo.

1076
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,289
Permanently so.

1077
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,001
Back again like a boomerang.

1078
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,588
Same old stand
Same old gang.

1079
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,716
Back in business with a bang.

1080
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:54,513
Let the good times roll.

1081
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,140
Back in business.

1082
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,017
And ain't it grand?

1083
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,853
Let the good times roll.

1084
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,316
Back to normal
Back to usual.

1085
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,361
Let the fun resume.

1086
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:13,448
No more doom and gloom.

1087
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,993
No more bust, just boom.

1088
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,455
Back in business and overnight.

1089
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:24,084
In demand
Well, all right.

1090
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:27,546
Business is just dynamite.

1091
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:32,592
Let the good times roll

1092
01:14:35,555 --> 01:14:38,181
Tracy didn't do it, Chief.
I know he didn't do it.

1093
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:42,227
You did the right thing to call me, Kid.
Tracy's in real bad shape about Tess.

1094
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,271
She's still missing,
and we haven't a clue.

1095
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,398
It looks like a kidnapping,
but nobody's asked for ransom.

1096
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,400
Tracy's the only one
who can find her.

1097
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,070
- Judge said no bail.
- He didn't do it, Chief.

1098
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,114
He didn't do it.

1099
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:58,034
Why would somebody kidnap Tess
and not even ask for a ransom?

1100
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,953
If I could just get back on that street...

1101
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:04,374
I'll leave the two of you alone
for a minute. It'll be anytime now.

1102
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,169
The state police will be coming
to transfer you

1103
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,921
to the county jail in a little while.

1104
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,259
How's the food?

1105
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,261
Good.

1106
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:19,806
How's the food at the orphanage?

1107
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:21,933
It's good.

1108
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,562
- It'll be anytime now.
- All right, Chief.

1109
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,647
What a New Year's Eve, huh?

1110
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:33,195
I got my permanent certificate.

1111
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,156
But... I thought you had to pick a name.

1112
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,574
I did.

1113
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,173
If it's all right with you?

1114
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:07,229
It's all right with me.

1115
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,485
It is.

1116
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:20,242
Tess, I hope
you like being alone with me.

1117
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,328
Happy new year.

1118
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,459
- Here, let me get that.
- Okay. It's okay.

1119
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,919
Sorry, Tracy.

1120
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:34,714
- Happy new year, Tracy.
- What are you two doing here?

1121
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,258
It's a long trip to county jail.

1122
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:41,179
I'd say it would take at least eight hours
to get there.

1123
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:42,722
All right, boys, call headquarters.

1124
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,474
Get them to send a car
to 38th and Central,

1125
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:45,976
and tell them there's something
I want them to bring.

1126
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:54,567
Hello, Mumbles! Who set me up? Huh?

1127
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:58,280
Talk! Talk, you cockroach! Talk!

1128
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:00,532
Huh? Huh?

1129
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,700
Okay, Pat.

1130
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:10,125
Care for some water, Mumbles? Huh?

1131
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,877
This is Brandon speaking.
Who's calling?

1132
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,588
Do you want to put Big Boy in jail?

1133
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:20,593
- Yes?
- He's kidnapped Tess Trueheart.

1134
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,929
- Go to 38th and Grand.
- Now wait a minute.

1135
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:25,765
- Who is this? Hello? Hello?
- Wait for a call.

1136
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:32,022
38th and Grand. That's the Club Ritz.

1137
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,400
- Joe! Get my car.
- Yes, sir?

1138
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,529
- Keep an eye on the Kid till I get back.
- Right, Chief.

1139
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,489
You don't want to tell me
who set me up, huh?

1140
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,036
You want Big Boy to hear that?

1141
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:52,667
Ah.

1142
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:01,968
What do you think, Mumbles?

1143
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:11,394
Big Boy did it. Big Boy did it.
Big Boy did it. Big Boy did it.

1144
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:27,744
Okay, Sam. Let's take this
and play it for Big Boy.

1145
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:31,581
Wait. Wait.

1146
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,294
88 Keys, the piano man, set you up.

1147
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,297
Big Boy paid him
to get you out of the way.

1148
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:44,636
Why would somebody kidnap
Tess and not even ask for a ransom?

1149
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,306
So what do we do? Grab 88 Keys,
or go straight for Big Boy?

1150
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:51,142
Yeah, Tracy, what do we do? Grab
88 Keys, or go straight for Big Boy?

1151
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,436
Is the enemy of my enemy my friend,

1152
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:56,773
- or the enemy of my friend my enemy?
- What?

1153
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:00,151
- Or the enemy of my enemy my enemy?
- What did he say?

1154
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:03,238
The enemy of my enemy is my enemy.

1155
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,866
He said the enemy
of his enemy is his enemy.

1156
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,076
Oh.

1157
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,290
Caprice speaking. Who is this?

1158
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,752
How long since you took
a look in your attic, Big Boy?

1159
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,838
Who is this?

1160
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:25,009
Better take a look around upstairs.
Something's fishy.

1161
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:30,140
Okay, Sam, you take the front.
We're going to the roof.

1162
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,933
Tracy, why are we going to the roof?

1163
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,394
I don't know. It seems like
a good place to hide.

1164
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,856
Can you get through to Chief Brandon?

1165
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:42,318
Big Boy. I think you ought
to come with me, quick.

1166
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,243
Tracy, why we going to the roof?

1167
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,626
This is Chief Brandon.

1168
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:24,903
Jumpin' Jimminy, Tracy. That's Tess!

1169
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:27,906
- Break that lock.
- Okay, Tracy, okay. Let me just...

1170
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:33,077
- What's she doing here?
- It won't budge, Tracy.

1171
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,954
- What is this?
- It's Tracy's dame!

1172
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,207
What is she doing here?
How'd she get in here?

1173
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,333
Tracy!

1174
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,584
Untie her! Come on!
We gotta get outta here!

1175
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,545
Untie her! Let's go! Get her outta here!

1176
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,589
- Don't shoot.
- A frame!

1177
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:45,924
It's a frame-up!

1178
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:49,010
Somebody tried to make it
look like we kidnapped her!

1179
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,554
It's a federal offense!
Come on! Come on!

1180
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:55,934
I'm okay, Tracy!

1181
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:59,312
That's kidnapping, Big Boy!
It's a federal offense!

1182
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,899
Things are not always what they seem.
You're gonna pay for this!

1183
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:05,109
- Easy!
- Anybody shoots, I shoot you,

1184
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:06,444
sweet pea! Come on!

1185
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:09,948
Tracy, what's goin' on?
Did you hurt yourself?

1186
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,742
Gotta figure a way out of here, Pat.

1187
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:13,952
Tracy, are you okay?

1188
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,455
Got my diamonds.

1189
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,832
Got my yacht.

1190
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:24,420
Got a guy I adore

1191
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,299
I'm so happy with what I got.

1192
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,637
I want more.

1193
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:34,389
There's no way out
of this place.

1194
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:37,559
You can't find a trapdoor or a panel
that moves or something?

1195
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,812
I'm looking, Pat.
The ceiling must be 20 feet high.

1196
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:51,030
Mathematician.

1197
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:54,158
All I know is addition.

1198
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,868
What are you doing down there?

1199
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,164
Tracy, what are you doing down there?

1200
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,880
Boss! Why are we surrounded by cops?

1201
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,507
- Cops?
- A billion of them!

1202
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,926
This is it! Burn the records!

1203
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:13,970
Lock all the doors. This is your fault.

1204
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:17,181
They're forcing me to use you
as a hostage. Break out the guns!

1205
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:19,601
Jeez, boss. Tracy's girl?

1206
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:23,062
Someone set us up. They're gonna
get us on a kidnapping rap.

1207
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:25,023
All of us! We've gotta get out of here.

1208
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,567
- Get out of my...
- Get out of my way!

1209
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:31,821
I like Tracy. I had a meeting
with him once. Did he tell you?

1210
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:34,240
Let me tell you. I may just put
a bullet through your head!

1211
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,617
Let's go!

1212
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:36,868
What do you weigh, Pat?

1213
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:39,120
I don't know. About 195, 196.

1214
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,246
Somethin' like that.

1215
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,832
- How much?
- 210.

1216
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:47,337
L find counting a bore.

1217
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,964
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting.

1218
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:54,218
More! More!

1219
01:22:57,056 --> 01:23:00,516
The only way to get into this joint,
Chief, is to bust our way in.

1220
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:02,518
- Jump.
- What?

1221
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,021
- Jump.
- Jump?

1222
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:08,983
- Keep your mouth shut, woman!
- You don't say nothin' to nobody.

1223
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:12,904
You may think they got us surrounded,
but I'm getting out of this.

1224
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:16,240
Watch it! Move it, woman!

1225
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:20,620
Now, however, I own the view.

1226
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,746
Come on. Just jump.

1227
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:33,091
Come out with your
hands over your head.

1228
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,260
Them coppers are never gonna take me
alive. We're making a break for it.

1229
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,098
Come out with your hands over
your heads. This is it.

1230
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,558
The jig is up!

1231
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,852
One is fun, why not two?

1232
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,063
And if you like two
might as well have four.

1233
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:49,357
And if you like four why not a few.

1234
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:52,443
Why not a slew more?

1235
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:56,781
Come on! Let's go! In the
car, in the car! Now, listen, you guys!

1236
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,326
When I hit my horn,
that's the signal to go.

1237
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:03,037
Okay, Big Boy!
Let's give it to them, boys!

1238
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,832
You gotta tell them everything.
They crave leadership.

1239
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,501
- You're under arrest. If you...
- Chief.

1240
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:10,962
- Look at him. What's he doin' up there?
- Tracy!

1241
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,434
If you've got a little, why not a lot?

1242
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,477
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle.

1243
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,938
Everyjot and tittle adds to the pot.

1244
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,065
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle.

1245
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:32,150
More!

1246
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,569
He does have Tess,
but he won't bring her out of there.

1247
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,028
- We gotta go in.
- Go in?

1248
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,239
Give me that tommy gun, Sam.

1249
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:43,494
Okay, hit your horn.

1250
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,247
You bring your men...

1251
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,756
...for something less.

1252
01:24:54,882 --> 01:24:58,384
Something's better than nothing, yes!

1253
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:33,085
This may get messy. You make a wrong
move inside here, I blow your head off!

1254
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,504
Big Boy!

1255
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,263
Come on! Yeah!

1256
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,830
You know, sometimes I wonder
why I try to improve things.

1257
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,706
Nobody seems to care.

1258
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,879
Pain can be valuable, Miss Trueheart.
We learn from pain.

1259
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:19,590
We learn... Don't make me push you!

1260
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,053
This is awkward. This is so awkward.

1261
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,513
Here.

1262
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:29,183
Let's go, men. Big Boy's inside.
He's got Tess with him.

1263
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:30,852
I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to come out.

1264
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,186
Right, Tracy.

1265
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,439
They say I kidnapped you.
I didn't kidnap you.

1266
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,733
But I'm kidnapping you now.

1267
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:39,443
- Does life imitate art?
- Mr. Caprice!

1268
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:43,447
So many questions, so few answers.
What a way to usher in the new year.

1269
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,457
He took her through there,
the wine room.

1270
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,422
Tracy.

1271
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,216
You don't trust me.

1272
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,222
Tracy?

1273
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:13,352
Good luck.

1274
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:18,649
Thanks.

1275
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:35,166
It was very stupid of you to have
been lured into this scheme.

1276
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,500
- Oh!
- A big mistake.

1277
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,462
Get them up, Keys.

1278
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,468
It's not so much that I have to hurt
someone, it's just don't make me do it!

1279
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:54,435
Ya louse!

1280
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,271
Believe me, this is not
the way I wanted it to be.

1281
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,384
There it is! The city!
They'll never find me.

1282
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:30,388
Can you hear its beat?
The rhythm. Happy new year, city!

1283
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,774
Jump! We can make it!
No, no, don't jump! We can't make it.

1284
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,663
You'll pay for this.
You're gonna pay for this.

1285
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,439
Don't move!
Not if you want to stay alive.

1286
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,775
A woman! A woman! A woman!

1287
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,944
I've been humiliated by a woman.

1288
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,781
The way I see it,
and Plato agrees with me,

1289
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:32,867
is that there is what is,

1290
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:35,911
and then there is
what we would like it to be.

1291
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:37,663
Well, that's not important.

1292
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:40,458
What's important is the future,
is planning ahead.

1293
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:44,462
"A man without a plan is not a man."
Nietzsche.

1294
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:46,881
Wait a minute.

1295
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:49,967
Wait. I'm having a thought.

1296
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,803
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1297
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:56,390
I'm gonna have a thought. It's coming.

1298
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,561
It's gone.

1299
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,568
Let's rise above the tide.

1300
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:11,155
Take that journey,
that journey into that faraway land,

1301
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,990
a land that just waits.

1302
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:16,368
It waits by the track,
where the train of destiny must run,

1303
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:20,414
run into the future
breaking the shackles of the past.

1304
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:24,335
Forget the past. Forget the...
Our limitations are our shackles.

1305
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:28,672
Put them behind you forever.
Put them behind you forever, Tess.

1306
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:32,843
Can't you see I love you?

1307
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:35,971
Wait! What's that?

1308
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:41,936
Hands up, copper! We gotta talk.

1309
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:45,481
I did not kidnap this woman.

1310
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:48,692
Drop that gun!
Or my next bullet's got her name on it!

1311
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,653
Don't do it, Dick!

1312
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:52,863
Good. Good, Tracy.

1313
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:55,950
What's that?

1314
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:57,743
Tracy!

1315
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,913
Tracy? Tracy?

1316
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:03,833
Where are ya? Where'd ya go?

1317
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,418
What, are you playin' hide-and-seek?

1318
01:31:06,503 --> 01:31:10,339
You're hidin' from me?
That's not fair. No way to be, Dick.

1319
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:13,384
Come out, Tracy.
These gears are turnin'.

1320
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:17,263
You want this dumb dame's head
to be smashed like a walnut?

1321
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:21,976
Tracy, I did not kidnap this girl.
Somebody's trying to frame me!

1322
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,146
Where are you? Come on. Just let me
see ya. I just wanna see your face.

1323
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,565
I just wanna talk some sense. I wanna...

1324
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:30,109
I just wanna take your head,
and I wanna crack it like an egg!

1325
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:32,862
No, no! I didn't mean that!
No, Tracy, listen to me.

1326
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:36,490
Tracy, you hear that?

1327
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:37,950
What's happening to that can

1328
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:40,369
is gonna be happening
to her head in a few seconds.

1329
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:44,874
There's not going to be anymore
beautiful hair to fondle, huh?

1330
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,042
No ears to nuzzle.

1331
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:50,754
You're gonna have
chopped sweetheart, Tracy.

1332
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,507
See those gears?
Those gears are like a clock.

1333
01:31:53,592 --> 01:31:56,177
Every notch, tick tock.

1334
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:20,326
Tracy!

1335
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,894
Drop it, Big Boy.

1336
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:50,147
Get your hands up, Tracy.
Don't move, either one of you.

1337
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:55,819
I outsmarted you, Big Boy.
I knew you'd panic.

1338
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,864
I brought you down with kidnapping,

1339
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:01,659
the only crime you didn't commit.

1340
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:04,828
Whoever you are,
I know we can make a deal.

1341
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:09,291
A deal?
I'm making my deal with Tracy.

1342
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:13,003
Tracy, with Big Boy out of the way,
we can own this town.

1343
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,714
Pick up that pipe and kill him.

1344
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:21,011
Pick it up!

1345
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,227
Pick up that pipe.

1346
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,107
Tracy, no!

1347
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:41,198
Drop that gun!

1348
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:54,586
I'll do it, Kid!

1349
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:59,633
Don't move your head, Tess. I got it.
It's okay. Don't turn your head.

1350
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:09,768
Hey, Tracy, look.

1351
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,414
Is he still alive?

1352
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:40,758
Will you look at that?

1353
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,473
Tess, call an ambulance.

1354
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:54,938
I'll call, Tess. I'll go get it.

1355
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:07,576
You were right, Tracy.
I couldn't pull the trigger.

1356
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,162
It was a good plan, Breathless.
You almost pulled it off.

1357
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,498
- The city would have been yours.
- Yeah.

1358
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,292
You were my only mistake.

1359
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:17,294
Tell me the truth.

1360
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:19,963
Could it ever have
happened between us?

1361
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:09,323
That's how we got him to confess
that Breathless killed Fletcher.

1362
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:12,117
- He was her piano player.
- Not bad.

1363
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:13,869
Right. Mmm-hmm.

1364
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,497
You know, you're probably much
too smart to need this,

1365
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:19,249
but I think I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

1366
01:37:22,045 --> 01:37:24,588
Gee!

1367
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,924
Tracy! This...

1368
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:30,594
Thank you. Wow!

1369
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,805
Tastes different, Mike.
What did you do? Wash the bowl?

1370
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,766
Don't listen to him, Mike. It's just grand.

1371
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:39,436
Except for the guy she goes
out with, this lady's got real taste.

1372
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,856
- Tess.
- What?

1373
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:45,734
- I've been thinking.
- What about?

1374
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:48,695
Well, you living alone, and...

1375
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:50,989
I like living alone.

1376
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,992
Uh-huh.

1377
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,203
We have that in common, I guess.

1378
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:57,955
Uh-huh.

1379
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:00,666
Well, don't we?

1380
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:04,169
Well, I just think

1381
01:38:04,254 --> 01:38:05,921
when two people have
so much in common,

1382
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:08,382
they ought to do something about it.

1383
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:15,556
Would...

1384
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,057
Uh-oh.

1385
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:19,142
Shut up, Kid.

1386
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,144
And...

1387
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:35,075
Don't...

1388
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,451
Yes?

1389
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:45,002
Don't you think we'd
be happier if we just...

1390
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,462
What?

1391
01:38:53,303 --> 01:38:54,428
What do you think?

1392
01:38:54,512 --> 01:38:57,097
Dick Tracy, are you asking me to...

1393
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,807
Calling Dick Tracy.
Pat Patton to Dick Tracy.

1394
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,727
Robbery in progress, Tracy.
Metropolitan Bank.

1395
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,812
Hot diggity dog!

1396
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,523
Come on! Let's go!

1397
01:39:06,983 --> 01:39:09,359
Come on, Tracy! Let's go! Come on!

1398
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:10,527
Come on, Tracy!

1399
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:13,905
Well, what are you waitin' for?
A nice, safe desk?

1400
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,956
Tess,

1401
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:29,546
you're one in a million.

1402
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:42,643
This is amazing, Tracy!
What are you waitin' for?

1403
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,686
Come on. Let's go!

1404
01:39:45,647 --> 01:39:49,566
Come on. Metropolitan Bank.
Come on. Step on it!

1405
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:54,696
You know somethin', Tracy?
I kinda like that dame.

1406
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:35,028
Once upon a time
I had plenty of nothin'

1407
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:36,321
Which was fine with me.

1408
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:38,824
Because I had rhythm, music, love.

1409
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:41,034
The sun, the stars
and the moon above.

1410
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:46,289
Had the clear blue sky
and the deep blue sea.

1411
01:40:46,374 --> 01:40:50,752
That was when the best things
in life were free.

1412
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:54,256
Then time went by
and now I get plenty of plenty.

1413
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,340
Which is fine with me.

1414
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:58,135
'Cause I still got love
I still got rhythm.

1415
01:40:58,219 --> 01:41:01,930
But look at what
I got to go with 'em.

1416
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:07,561
"Who could ask for anything more?"
I hear you query.

1417
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:12,566
Who could ask for anything more?
Well, let me tell you.

1418
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:15,652
Dearie.

1419
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,991
Got my diamonds.

1420
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,285
Got my yacht.

1421
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:27,914
Got a guy I adore

1422
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:32,461
I'm so happy with what I got

1423
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:37,007
I want more.

1424
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,342
Count your blessings.

1425
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:41,678
One, two, three

1426
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:46,141
I just hate keeping score.

1427
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:50,270
Any number is fine with me.

1428
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:54,149
As long as it's more.

1429
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:57,736
As long as it's more!

1430
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:02,240
I'm no mathematician.

1431
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:06,953
All I know is addition

1432
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,874
I find counting a bore.

1433
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,752
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting.

1434
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:15,754
More!

1435
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:22,928
L got rhythm.

1436
01:42:23,012 --> 01:42:25,222
Music, too.

1437
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:29,810
Just as much as before.

1438
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:34,314
Got my guy and my sky of blue.

1439
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:39,027
Now, however, I own the view.

1440
01:42:39,111 --> 01:42:42,906
More is better than nothing, true.

1441
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:47,786
But nothing's better than
more, more, more.

1442
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:53,083
Nothing's better than more.

1443
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:57,003
One is fun, why not two?

1444
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,172
And if you like two
might as well have four.

1445
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:01,466
And if you like four why not a few.

1446
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:04,845
Why not a slew more?

1447
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:07,055
If you've got a little, why not a lot?

1448
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:09,266
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle.

1449
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,518
Everyjot and tittle adds to the pot.

1450
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,854
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle.

1451
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:18,316
More!

1452
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:20,569
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

1453
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:22,863
lf it's gonna rain, let it pour.

1454
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,073
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

1455
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:29,995
lf you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many much more?

1456
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:34,541
Or does that sound too greedy?

1457
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:39,045
That's not greed, no indeedy.

1458
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:43,174
That's just stocking the store.

1459
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:45,886
Gotta fill your cupboard
Remember Mother Hubbard.

1460
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:50,223
More!

1461
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:54,936
Each possession you possess.

1462
01:43:55,021 --> 01:43:59,441
Helps your spirits to soar.

1463
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:04,029
That's what's soothing about excess.

1464
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:07,782
Something's better than nothing, yes!

1465
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:12,746
But nothing's better than
more, more, more.

1466
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:15,248
Except all, all, all.

1467
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:21,796
Except once you have it all.

1468
01:44:21,881 --> 01:44:23,882
Have it all.

1469
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:29,137
You may find all else above.

1470
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:32,015
Else above.

1471
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:36,353
That though things.

1472
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:38,563
Are bliss.

1473
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:45,320
There's one thing you miss.

1474
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:48,657
And.

1475
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,993
That's.

1476
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:57,666
More!

1477
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,960
More! More! More! More!

1478
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:01,753
More! More! More!
