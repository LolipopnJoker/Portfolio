-What's going on here?
-Why, Michael, I thought you'd never ask.

526

You see, these aliens
come from outer space,

527
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,253
and they want to make us
slaves in their theme park.

528

Eh, what do we care? They're little.

529
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,423
So, we challenged them
to a basketball game.

530
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,426
But then they show up
and they ain't so little. They're huge.

531
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,263
We need to beat these guys,
because they're talking about slavery.

532

every night for all eternity.

534
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,895

to come out now, okay?

Oh, I hate to leave him like this.

545
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:42,062

had to get away from that Stan character.

is gonna need some new people.

1365
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,410
Leave the baseball player alone, man.

1366
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:47,746
You know he doesn't play
basketball anymore.

1367
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,332
You know, he probably
doesn't even have it anymore, guys.

1368
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:52,167
Michael, do you hear them?

1369
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,336
They don't think
you can play the game anymore.

1370
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,092
There's only one way to find out.

1371
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,891
ANNOUNCER:
The Chicago Bulls welcome back

1372
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,437
Michael Jordan!

1373
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,647
(CROWD CHEERING)

1374
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,201
What's the matter, Bill?

1375
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,164
Larry, that could have been me.

1376
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:32,833
Will you get off that kick?

1377
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,543
It's over. It's done with. You can't play.

1378
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,716
Okay.

1379
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,093
Let's go, Bulls.

1380
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,062
(CROWD CHEERING)

1381
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,958
Well, that's all, folks.

1382
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:56,002
That's my line.

1383
01:26:57,044 --> 01:27:00,298
Step aside, babe. Let a star do this.

1384
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,633
That's all... (YELPS)

1385
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,093
TOGETHER: That's all, folks.

1386
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,721
Can I go home now?
