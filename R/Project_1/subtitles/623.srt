2
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,438
Negative. No sign.

3
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,224
Wait a second. I think I got him.

4
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,294
You know...

5
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,131
...you could put someone's eye out
with that thing.

6
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,801
We airlifted out the last passengers,
Ace. We're heading out.

7
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:18,096
What about the animal cargo?

8
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:23,268
Don't worry. It's just one little
raccoon. If I were you, I'd turn back.

9
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,602
Yeah?

10
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,022
If you were me, then I'd be you!

11
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,316
And I'd use your body to get to the top!

12
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,444
You can't stop me,
no matter who you are!

13
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,281
Loser!

14
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,080
L- o-o-...

15
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,540
...s-e-r.

16
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,851
Hungry, fella?

17
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,077
That ought to hold you for a while.

18
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,197
That's okay, Spike.

19
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,117
There's nothing more we can do.

20
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,121
Look, Spike!

21
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,233
Do not fret, my woodland friend.

22
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,861
Your life is in the hands
of Ace Ventura...

23
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,654
...Pet Detective.

24
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,419
Whatever you do...

25
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,466
...don't look down.

26
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,042
Hang on!

27
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,627
Hang on, little buddy!

28
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,462
I got you!

29
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,297
I think I got you!

30
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,133
Maybe not. You're slipping!

31
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,719
Don't let go!

32
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,290
My goodness.

33
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,303
Hello, heh.

34
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,305
That was quite a shock.

35
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,100
It's, um, extremely nice to meet you.

36
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,603
My name is Fulton Greenwall...

37
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,564
...and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.

38
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,733
No man here...

39
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,693
...carries with him...

40
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,944
...a label.

41
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,237
What?

42
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,197
Oh, yes.

43
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,241
No names. How silly of me.

44
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,493
He's an American.

45
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,121
We are all children...

46
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,749
...of the same life force.

47
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,251
Yes, of course we are.

48
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:41,753
Well, uh...

49
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,380
He bends over and speaks from his rear.

50
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, him.

51
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,344
Right this way.

52
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,930
He came to us a broken man.

53
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,476
He had lost the will
to sustain his existence.

54
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,687
Yes, I heard about that unfortunate
accident with the raccoon.

55
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,814
It was terrible for him.

56
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,816
But the life force...

57
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,193
...once again...

58
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,944
...smiled upon him.

59
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,196
He's now...

60
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,864
...at peace.

61
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,798
I will wait here.

62
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,320
Oh, oh.

63
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,906
I must apologize.

64
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,659
Quite. Well, uh, um, no harm done.

65
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,244
Let me introduce myself.

66
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,622
My name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I'm here to employ your services...

67
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,708
...in the retrieval of a lost animal.

68
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,209
Can you help us?

69
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,546
Your request is like your intestine.

70
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,549
Stinky and dangerous.

71
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,300
We can pay handsomely.

72
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
I am now a child of light.

73
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,889
Your earthly money
holds no appeal to me.

74
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,225
Twenty thousand dollars.

75
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:23,396
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!

76
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,231
Really?

77
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,736
No.

78
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,405
I cannot.

79
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,324
For I am sorely needed...

80
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,951
...here...

81
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,329
...at the ashram.

82
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,914
May I interject?

83
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,292
We're short of space.

84
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,795
And it's important for you
to use your talents.

85
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,964
Let me help you pack.

86
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:55,678
But I am yet to attain
omnipresent super-galactic oneness.

87
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,598
Wait!

88
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,641
There it is!

89
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,102
You've just attained it.

90
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,771
I have?

91
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,397
Just now.

92
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,316
You are one!

93
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,611
I can see it in your eyes.

94
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,198
You're more one than anyone.

95
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,784
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?

96
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,452
Take mine.

97
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,122
This took you 80 years to achieve!

98
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,459
That's okay.
I don't like it anymore. Really.

99
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,965
In light of this personal sacrifice
you've made...

100
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,011
...I have no choice...

101
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,473
...but to take the case.

102
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,766
Great!

103
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,476
I'll tell the others.

104
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,144
Master!

105
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,025
Break it to them gently.

106
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,845
I've never seen them
act like that before.

107
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,681
Denial can be an ugly thing.

108
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,684
We should go, Mr. Ventura.
I've arranged a plane.

109
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,019
I'll meet you at the bottom.

110
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,357
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.

111
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,577
Isn't this incredible?

112
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,038
It's going to be some kind of record!

113
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,249
Everyone loves a Slinky

114
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,251
You gotta get a Slinky

115
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,711
Slinky, Slinky

116
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,754
Go, Slinky, go!

117
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,594
Oh, man!

118
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,346
Can you believe it?

119
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,266
It was right there!

120
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,602
One more time?

121
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,397
Forgive me, but if we don't hurry,
we might miss the plane.

122
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,441
Of course.

123
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,568
How selfish of me.

124
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,196
Let's do all the things
that you want to do.

125
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,515
Canadian moose during mating season.

126
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,142
And now...

127
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,145
...a yak.

128
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,025
Yak.

129
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,489
Peanut?

130
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,116
Yes, I have one right here!

131
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,953
It's bulky, but I consider it a carryon.

132
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,454
Peanuts?

133
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,124
Oh, I see. Ha, ha!

134
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,461
If we can get back to business,
Mr. Ventura?

135
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:18,506
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.

136
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,759
Since their sacred animal
has vanished...

137
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,972
...they believe that there is a curse
fallen on their village.

138
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,810
It all started some time ago when,
one night...

139
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,271
So the daughter of the Wachati chief...

140
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,900
...is set to wed the first son of
the Wachootoo tribe.

141
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,821
And the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.

142
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,573
But if it is not recovered...

143
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,450
...the result will be...

144
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,704
...the merciless slaughter of
the Wachati.

145
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,499
Uh, Mr. Ventura?

146
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,839
There's...

147
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,257
...someone on the wing.

148
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,591
Some...

149
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,176
...thing!

150
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,890
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

151
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,310
The daughter of the Wachati chief...

152
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,687
...is set to wed...

153
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,690
...the first son of the Wachootoo tribe.

154
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,880
Spectacular!

155
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,425
This land holds great beauty!

156
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,068
How far to the crime scene?

157
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,695
I've been instructed
to bring you to the consulate...

158
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,655
...which is beyond the trees...

159
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,451
...on the other side of the jungle.
So we'll have to circle around... Aah!

160
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,667
Steering's a bit loose!

161
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:22,922
Alignment's off!

162
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,309
Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

163
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,436
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
We love you

164
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:41,107
And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too

165
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,567
Everybody go
On Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we depend

166
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,904
Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered friend

167
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:50,366
Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered-

168
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,201
Chitty Bang Bang

169
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,410
Chitty Bang Bang yeah

170
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,332
Chitty

171
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,550
Ah, there's the consulate!

172
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,301
Oh, thank God!

173
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,929
If I can just find a parking spot...

174
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,099
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy bit.

175
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,767
Nonsense, poopy pants!

176
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,936
We're going a bit fast!

177
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,522
Really! Look out!

178
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,872
Like a glove!

179
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,506
You should get this baby detailed.

180
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,343
The Consul General's car!

181
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,179
Down!

182
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,889
That's it. Down.

183
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,198
Come on, man!

184
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,248
Whoa.

185
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,547
Mr. Ventura, so looking forward
to your arrival.

186
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,348
Didn't seem that painful
when you were doing it to the horse.

187
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:42,478
Ha, ha, uh, sir, uh, Mr. Ventura
has an affinity for animals.

188
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,397
Shall we?

189
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,399
Shalln't we?

190
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,446
Tell me, Mr. Ventura...

191
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,740
...just how good are you?

192
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,534
You're a workaholic.

193
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,746
You recently returned from a trip to Gotan,
in Northern Africa...

194
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,666
...and you just took a nasty spill
because of some...

195
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,461
...shoddy masonry work.

196
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,755
Very impressive.

197
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,882
May I ask how?

198
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,467
Surely.

199
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,348
The abrasion on your hand is the type
sustained in a three-to-five foot fall.

200
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,601
The remnants of plaster on your shoe
pointed to a careless mason.

201
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,271
Your new watch,
a quality forgery of Cartier, was...

202
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,275
...most likely purchased through
the North African black market!

203
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,279
And my work habits?

204
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,239
A workaholic.

205
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,782
Urine stain on your pants...

206
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,243
...would signify that
you're a single-shaker!

207
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,578
Far too busy for the follow-up jiggle.

208
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,081
Brilliant, Mr. Ventura! Simply brilliant!

209
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,167
Spank you!
Spank you very much!

210
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,466
We've been coexisting quite nicely
with the native cultures...

211
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,762
...for the past 200 years.
They're almost like family at this point.

212
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,764
- Are they?
- It is imperative...

213
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,683
...that we recover the sacred animal.

214
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,520
If not, the peaceable
Wachati will be obliterated.

215
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,106
The Wachootoo are bloodthirsty.

216
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:13,277
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.

217
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,286
Do I have something in my teeth?

218
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,955
Ah, Cadby!

219
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,291
Lovely brunch, I must say.

220
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,129
Quinn!
I'd like you to meet Ace Ventura.

221
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,842
This is Burton Quinn. He owns
and operates Quinnland Safari Park.

222
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,302
Most call me Quinn.

223
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,180
Say hello, Tinky.

224
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:46,310
Pleasure, Tinky. Corvus corax.
Common raven. Smartest of all birds.

225
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,187
Rare in these parts.

226
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,818
Excuse me.

227
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,910
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.

228
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,496
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers...

229
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,874
...made from the heads of
innocent and defenseless baby seals!

230
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,294
Who is this ghastly man?

231
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,838
Ace Ventura, pet detective.

232
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,883
You must be
the Monopoly Guy!

233
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,514
Thanks for the free parking.

234
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,892
Another activist, Maguire.

235
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,353
Activist, yes.

236
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,816
Activist, yes, heh, heh.

237
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,027
Mr. Ventura...

238
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:41,740
...there's nothing wrong with
enjoying the fruits of nature.

239
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,076
You should try it some time.

240
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,078
Alrighty, then.

241
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,708
You know something?

242
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,419
You're right.

243
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,855
Mwah!

244
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,399
Mm-hm, ha.

245
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,787
"Do not pass go.
Do not collect two hundred dollars. "

246
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,461
It's lovely, but I fancy myself
an autumn.

247
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,217
If you've quite finished, Mr. Ventura...

248
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,304
...we might make for
the projection room.

249
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,806
Kookie.

250
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,854
I'd like you to meet Hitu, chief
of tribal security in the province.

251
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,439
Please!

252
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,608
Don't...

253
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,443
...get up.

254
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,160
At this point,
we don't have any leads...

255
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,121
...but we've had similar
problems in the past.

256
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,002
Oh, heh.

257
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,338
Sorry.

258
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,093
This is Derrick McCane...

259
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:30,140
...spotted several times in the province
in the past year. He makes a living...

260
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:33,018
...from rare and endangered species.

261
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,106
Ah, these two are Australians.

262
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,359
The bald one is Mick Katie.

263
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,820
The other is said to have
been raised by aborigine.

264
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,284
Aborigines.

265
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,744
The natives call him-

266
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,874
Call him Gahjii the hunter.

267
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,713
Both are known poachers
and have been seen in the area!

268
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,469
This wedding's in four days.
I cannot have bloodshed here!

269
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,680
We're counting on you!

270
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,233
Hi-ho, Silver!

271
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,901
Away!

272
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,530
I've assigned Greenwall to assist you.

273
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,200
Before you go, Mr. Ventura...

274
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,870
...I'd like to show you
something you may enjoy.

275
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,748
As one animal lover to another.

276
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:57,603
Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?

277
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,609
Of course not.

278
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,777
There is a lovely room of death.

279
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,946
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

280
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,244
Down, Boba!

281
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,588
Mr. Ventura, how could you?

282
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:48,278
Now, Mr. Ventura, I think
the village is about a mile ahead.

283
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,655
Excellent.

284
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,114
Flat tire!

285
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,662
I think this joke has run
its course, don't you?

286
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,205
Certainly.

287
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,083
I prostrate myself before you
and beg forgiveness.

288
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,710
Don't get me wrong.
I do enjoy the occasional prank.

289
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,672
It's just that my heel
is getting rather raw.

290
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,928
We love you, dark continent!
Good night!

291
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,224
Listen!

292
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,647
The majestic song of
the male silverback gorilla.

293
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:28,985
We should move along. It's their mating
season and they can get rather hostile.

294
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,166
Oh.

295
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,252
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Ventura.

296
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,920
I have to rest.

297
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,839
- Of course you do!
- Oh.

298
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:53,009
The Wachati believe they draw
their power from these caves.

299
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:57,347
Now they live in fear since
their sacred bat has vanished.

300
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,683
Bat?

301
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,896
What bat?

302
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,441
The one we're here to find,
Mr. Ventura.

303
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,194
You didn't say anything about a bat.

304
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,030
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference, heh?

305
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,658
Have you seen one? They're hideous.

306
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:21,747
Lifeless, beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge grotesque wings. Even fangs.

307
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,419
They give you rabies.

308
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,797
Yes, quite. I see your point.

309
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,050
But are you saying
that you won't take the case?

310
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:40,056
No. As a being of light, I must show
compassion for all living things.

311
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,349
Good.

312
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,226
I'm not touching it, though!

313
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,270
No, spank you.

314
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,745
The Wachati are a peaceful people.

315
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,456
They find all forms of life sacred.

316
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,458
I like them already.

317
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,460
Bumbawae Atuna.

318
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,421
Nice to see you.

319
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:12,798
Bumblebee Tuna.

320
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,257
Bumblebee Tuna.

321
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,219
Ace Ventura, pet detective.

322
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:18,762
How are you?

323
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,931
Alrighty, then.

324
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,393
Excuse me.

325
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,437
Your balls are showing.

326
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,272
Bumblebee Tuna.

327
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,777
They have lived in the same state
for thousands of years.

328
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,614
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.

329
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,120
What's going on over here?

330
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:48,208
All young Wachati warriors
must face five days...

331
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,918
...of balance and concentration.

332
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,462
Should he lose his focus and fall...

333
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,840
...he must start over again.

334
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,801
Earthquake test!

335
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,973
He's good.

336
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,184
With my help, he could be the best.

337
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,395
We should see the chief,
Mr. Ventura.

338
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,857
- This way.
- Neato!

339
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,207
The chief says he knew you would come.

340
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,340
Chim-chiminy chim-chim-cheroo! Hey!

341
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:44,639
Uh, the chief has not understood
the dialect you're using.

342
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,059
Say I'm happy to meet him.
And that his sacred...

343
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,520
...bat...

344
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,397
...is as good as found.

345
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,827
My goodness. The chief
really seems to like you.

346
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:09,414
That is a great sign of affection
in the Wachati tribe.

347
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:14,920
Really!

348
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,881
Oh, this is the chief's son, Ouda.

349
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,842
The missionaries came through
and taught him English.

350
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,594
I like you!

351
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,100
My...

352
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,604
Aren't I the popular one?

353
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,944
Allow me to display my affection.

354
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,891
It is the mucus...

355
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,935
...that binds us.

356
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:18,108
The chief says that
the sacred hut is over there.

357
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,075
How'd they pass the guard?

358
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,995
I'm afraid he was found shortly after...

359
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,788
...sleeping.

360
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,000
At ease, soldier.

361
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,293
We all make mistakes.

362
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,642
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy, flying weasel.

363
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,312
Please, Mr. Ventura!

364
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,692
That is sacred ground. I'm sorry,
but only the Wachati are allowed there.

365
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,403
Take it easy.

366
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,697
I'm the lougie guy, remember?

367
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,003
Eh, yes, yes, Chief. Thank you.

368
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,839
Thank you.

369
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:26,176
The chief says that unless
the sacred bat is returned...

370
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:31,222
...before the marriage of the princess,
the Wachati tribe will meet their death.

371
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,725
What type of bat are we talking about?

372
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,686
The great white bat, of course.

373
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,864
Crepuscular Chiroptera?

374
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,033
But to the natives:

375
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,409
Shikaka.

376
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,510
Shikasha, ah!

377
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,762
Shish kebab.

378
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,972
Shawshank Redemption.

379
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,390
Chicago!

380
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,601
You're out of there!

381
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,104
Go on. You're gone. Go on!

382
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,088
Were you going to eat these?

383
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,978
I've got to inspect that cage.

384
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,818
Mm.

385
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,653
My, my, my.

386
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,447
This fruit paste is delicious!

387
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,241
The pottery is lovely!

388
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,826
It's made from guano.

389
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,369
Guano?

390
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:17,996
That sounds so familiar.

391
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,123
Bat droppings.

392
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:28,464
It's a chief resource of the Wachati.
They use it to make things.

393
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,467
Yummy!

394
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,037
Now, this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition.

395
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,706
The virgin's dance of seduction.

396
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:08,796
I am now a holy man.

397
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,674
I think of women only
as mothers of our children.

398
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,552
They are a sanctuary for
the reproductive organs.

399
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:18,014
A temple to house
the miracle of procreation.

400
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,683
Do you have $1?

401
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,606
Oh, heh.

402
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,026
Thank you so much!
I've not danced in years!

403
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,880
Hi.

404
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,883
Don't mind me.

405
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,718
Sleep.

406
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:57,929
Sleep!

407
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,772
Fe Fi!

408
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,733
Fo fum!

409
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,904
I smell the fingerprints of scum!

410
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,412
Better dust the place.

411
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:39,804
Totally clean.

412
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,640
Not one damn clue.

413
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,103
Unless...

414
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,313
Here she comes. Oh, boy.

415
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,648
Holy, holy, holy, holy.

416
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,485
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.

417
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,695
You have come to help us.

418
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,530
We are in...

419
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,824
...great appreciation.

420
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,326
You...

421
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:45,828
...speak English.

422
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,663
Yes, heh!

423
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,583
- The missionaries came with books.
- Oh.

424
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,590
Oh, heh.

425
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,967
You are very good with that, heh!

426
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,178
It's incredibly accurate.

427
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,514
Care to try?

428
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,687
Not bad!

429
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,273
Try again. Relax your shoulders.

430
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:15,650
Breathe.

431
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,568
And release.

432
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,240
There you go!

433
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,034
You make me smile.

434
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,371
And yet...

435
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,249
...I am troubled.

436
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,085
You see...

437
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,380
...the man my father
wants me to marry...

438
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,883
...I am worried I will not please him.

439
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:49,100
I've never known a man.

440
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,319
I'd love to help.

441
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,904
But you see...

442
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:05,783
...I have vowed
to take a life of celibacy.

443
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,703
Well...

444
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,121
Perhaps this...

445
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,915
...will assist your decision, heh.

446
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,589
Those are very nice.

447
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,300
But I am a child of light.
A pure spirit.

448
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:25,636
I'm no longer encumbered
by sexual appetites.

449
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,101
Oh, mama, oh, mama...

450
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,979
...oh, mama, oh, mama...

451
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,402
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ventura...

452
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,827
That's okay.

453
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,163
I was just...

454
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,666
...practicing my mantra.

455
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,378
Oh, uh...

456
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,174
- You wanted to visit the sacred caves.
- I do!

457
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,801
- Meet me outside in 10 minutes.
- Mm-hm.

458
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,929
If I don't finish my meditation...

459
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,806
...I tend to get a little cranky.

460
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,184
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

461
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,196
Everything here seems good!
Heh, big load off my mind!

462
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:29,325
You can speculate all you want,
but unless you check it out yourself...

463
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,702
...you never know. Let's go back.

464
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,663
Don't you think you should investigate?

465
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,457
There's no reason to go in there. Ever.

466
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,417
I sense it as a holy man.

467
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,878
- You said you wanted-
- It's dark!

468
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,589
I could fall into a precipice.

469
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:45,591
Take this.

470
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,012
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.

471
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,202
I am not afraid!

472
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,374
I am not afraid.

473
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:26,966
I really like it here, oh.

474
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,276
My medallion!

475
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,908
I will fear no living creature...

476
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,411
...as long as I keep this near me.

477
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,583
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!

478
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,046
Oh, grr.

479
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,424
That's okay.

480
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,678
All I really need is my torch.

481
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,098
Die, devil bird! Aah!

482
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,771
I'm okay.

483
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,863
They're in my hair!

484
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,115
They're in my hair!

485
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:37,161
God in heaven! Help me!

486
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,290
There is nothing in your hair.

487
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,877
Exactly.

488
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:47,296
I was merely running a drill.

489
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,929
Just as I suspected.

490
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,306
- Quinn.
- What?

491
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,600
We met him at Cadby's soiree.

492
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,645
His bird is a raven, Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.

493
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:06,440
You don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a powerful man.

494
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,150
Worry not.

495
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:11,153
For I...

496
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:13,322
...am a master...

497
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,324
...of disguises.

498
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,880
Eat up, guys!

499
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,549
None of this animal goes to waste.

500
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,082
Ah.

501
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,584
Mr. McCane.

502
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:49,835
How're you?

503
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,754
McCANE:
I'm doing well.

504
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,097
Unh. Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.

505
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,601
I'm just a curious little rhino.

506
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,812
I appreciate your...

507
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,314
...agreeing to undertake this.

508
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:22,284
Meeting secretly
with sinister types much?

509
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:25,955
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.

510
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:50,145
Kind of hot in these rhinos.

511
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,868
Warm!

512
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,202
Phew.

513
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,503
I had a dog and his name was...

514
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,338
...Bingo!

515
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,176
Ah, time to get some oxygen.

516
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,727
Come on!

517
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:41,864
Mayday!

518
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,250
Must have air!

519
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,775
Come on!

520
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,904
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Look, look.

521
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:27,451
Oh, look!

522
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:30,496
The mother rhino is giving birth!

523
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,251
Oh, God.

524
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,773
Mommy!

525
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,785
Cool!

526
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,286
We have to get out of here!

527
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,080
Quick, get in the jeep.

528
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,957
Quick, girls, get in!

529
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:18,002
Welcome to Quinnland.

530
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,756
And you too, my friend.

531
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,013
I know you'll be happy here.

532
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,395
Huh. Ah!

533
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,314
How did you get out, fella?

534
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,028
You're a cute little devil.

535
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,864
What you got?

536
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,800
Where's the bat?

537
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:09,303
What's this about?

538
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:10,804
Who are you?

539
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:12,681
Where...

540
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,391
...is...

541
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,351
...the bat?

542
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,312
I know who you are.

543
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,856
I met you at Cadby's!

544
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,191
You're that...

545
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,817
...Ventura fella!

546
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,903
Last chance!

547
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:30,157
Where is that darn bat?

548
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:32,993
What're you going to do?

549
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,745
What're you going to do?

550
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,915
Whatever I have to get some answers.

551
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,341
Stop!

552
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,759
Stop it!

553
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,595
You'd like me to stop it, hmm?

554
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,472
Getting to you?

555
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,350
Ah, I won't tell you anything.

556
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,983
Ooh.

557
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,986
A tough guy, huh?

558
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:10,489
I know what to do with tough guys.

559
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,990
Wee!

560
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,128
My brother used to do that!

561
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:25,963
You sadistic bastard!

562
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,422
Stop it!

563
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,216
All right! I'll talk!

564
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:33,887
- Spill it!
- I paid Derrick McCane to find the bat.

565
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:39,810
I thought it could be an attraction.

566
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,146
Business has been a bit off lately.

567
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:43,981
So...

568
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,484
...you don't know who...

569
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,239
- ... took the bat?
- Neither does McCane.

570
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,331
I'm going to untie you now.

571
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,835
Before I do, I want you
to know that I'm really...

572
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,336
...truly...

573
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:07,588
...very...

574
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,506
...sorry!

575
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,180
Appreciate the lift!

576
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,432
We'll walk from here.

577
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:26,523
Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues.

578
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,150
But I have instincts.

579
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,278
And my instincts tell me
we're getting closer.

580
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,863
I can feel it.

581
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:35,949
I can feel it like it's right...

582
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,784
...in my neck!

583
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,036
Run!

584
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:47,961
Starting to get numb!

585
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,387
Three darts...

586
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:59,056
...is too much!

587
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:34,174
I think I lost them!

588
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,747
Flowers...

589
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,749
...for me?

590
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:11,503
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.

591
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:15,590
You are my hero.

592
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,682
Was I...

593
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:25,684
...talking in my sleep?

594
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:30,105
You've been suffering hysteria.
It's a natural reaction to the poison.

595
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,606
Water.

596
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:41,033
Guano bowls.

597
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,410
Collect the whole set.

598
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,121
Ace, did you see the shooter?

599
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,622
Only their feet.

600
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,791
Not enough for a positive ID.

601
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:52,210
It's the dart of a Wachootoo shaman.

602
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,504
The what-y what-an?

603
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:58,800
The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,
protests the intertribal wedding.

604
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,306
Does he?

605
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:08,268
You do not speak Wachootoo.

606
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,395
I go with you.

607
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,398
Ouda will be my interpreter.

608
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,943
Please, take care.

609
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:21,490
The Wachootoo are savages.
If they catch you, they'll be merciless.

610
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,825
Worry not.

611
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:27,913
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.

612
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:31,833
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...

613
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:35,337
...thing.

614
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,365
The sacred bat must be in a hut.

615
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,451
We'll never know until
I can walk freely among them.

616
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:12,207
Wunderbar!

617
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,793
He exclaimed with great relish.

618
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,820
Come on, girls,
show them what you got. Unh!

619
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,072
Big finish.

620
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,255
I'm sure it's fine.

621
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:02,966
Ouda is probably going
for help right now.

622
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:04,843
Hello, Ace!

623
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:08,180
They found me! No sweat!

624
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,767
Don't beat yourself up.

625
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,652
You know...

626
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:26,948
...gingivitis is the number one
cause of all tooth decay.

627
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,246
What does "equinsu ocha" mean?

628
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,040
White devil.

629
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:39,544
- Tell him I'm not.
- I only met you. How do I know?

630
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,968
- He said-
- Let me guess. "White devil"?

631
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,678
You speak Wachootoo?

632
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,889
Tell them what I'm saying:

633
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:54,809
I come in peace!

634
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,611
I couldn't help but notice
the "equinsu ocha" part.

635
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:06,696
Did you refer to me as "White Devil"?

636
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,323
That's how they know you.

637
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,825
Leave that part out from now on.

638
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,995
I represent the princess!

639
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,008
War is hell.

640
00:56:27,343 --> 00:56:29,678
The last thing we want...

641
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,639
...is a fight.

642
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,572
The chief said...

643
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,907
...if you pass all Wachootoo tests...

644
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,034
...you do not die.

645
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,081
Kookie.

646
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:32,133
Ah. My entrance to the winner's circle!

647
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:36,304
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.

648
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,139
Do not worship me!

649
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,070
Chief says you have passed
all tests but one.

650
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:55,615
Only left is Wachootoo Circle of Death.

651
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:57,367
Funny...

652
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,703
...that's my specialty.

653
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,240
This is it?

654
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,576
I have to beat him?

655
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,424
Alrighty, then!

656
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,511
I must tell you...

657
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,265
...I don't wish to fight.

658
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,436
Violence is no longer in my nature...

659
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:09,773
...but if you want it,
you got it, sister.

660
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,238
Biting, I see.

661
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:20,283
I was unaware that the Wachootoo...

662
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,286
...were biters!

663
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:27,373
Why don't you try this on
and see how it fits?

664
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,132
He much better fighter than you.

665
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:37,884
Doi!

666
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:56,110
All right!

667
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,155
This White Devil thing
has gone far enough.

668
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:00,698
Nobody...

669
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,492
...messes...

670
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,744
...with the "do"!

671
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,931
He said, sorry, White Devil...

672
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,683
...but he must kill you.

673
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,937
I'll have you know
I have the reflexes of a cat.

674
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,523
And the speed of a mongoose.

675
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,149
Throw it!

676
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,943
I dare you!

677
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:57,297
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!

678
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:28,036
It's in the bone! It's in the bone!

679
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,663
It's in the bone!

680
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,391
He says you make him laugh.

681
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,102
You are like sissy girl!

682
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,246
Wachootoo Chief say,
"You friend to Wachootoo. "

683
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:24,258
But if the curse of Shikaka not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky...

684
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:28,721
...Wachootoo kill all Wachati
and smash your head on a rock.

685
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,600
Super.

686
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,352
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

687
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:37,480
Take care, now. Super. Bye-bye, then.

688
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:42,568
Are your legs sore?
Want me to carry you?

689
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:44,570
That won't be necessary.

690
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,364
I have a high pain threshold.

691
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,408
Ah, holy monkey!

692
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,518
Ace, why you stopped?

693
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,939
The Wachootoo didn't take Shikaka.

694
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,777
Hi, welcome back.

695
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,821
What would you say this is?

696
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:28,698
Dart of Wachootoo shaman.

697
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:32,201
Precisely.
And when compared to one of the darts...

698
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:34,245
- ... that hit me before?
- Same.

699
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,457
Only to the untrained eye.

700
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:41,210
The Wachootoo dart is made of
wood from a mimosa tree...

701
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:46,007
...while the other is carved from
a red fungus-bearing acalla.

702
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,010
And there's only one area
of the jungle with red...

703
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,054
...fungus-bearing acallas.

704
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,639
Go back to the village.

705
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:56,726
Tell them the Wachootoo attack
tomorrow at noon.

706
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:03,649
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.

707
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,829
Won't be long now, Katie.

708
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,501
Big night tonight.

709
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,836
You're going to meet your new owner.

710
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,589
Good day. Disgusting rat!

711
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,608
Gravy!

712
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,615
Did you hear that?

713
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,327
- What is it?
- Silverback.

714
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,173
Female.

715
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,843
- Big.
- Yeah?

716
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,303
About 200 meters...

717
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:17,181
...south.

718
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:20,351
We'd get $5000 for one of those.

719
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:23,146
- What about the rat?
- Don't worry about it.

720
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,189
We'll be back in no time.

721
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,196
Stay downwind of it.

722
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,587
Blah.

723
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,006
You're even uglier than I thought.

724
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,009
She's a big one, isn't she?

725
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,571
Oh, boy.

726
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,698
Deciduous trees on the bank.

727
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,367
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.

728
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,536
Steadily increasing water current.

729
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:21,829
Spike...

730
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:26,209
...I think we could assume the stream gets
pretty rough up ahead.

731
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:39,222
As soon as I get you loose,
you can chew through my ropes.

732
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,563
That's it!
That's it!

733
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,067
Yes. Your turn.

734
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:55,446
All right!

735
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:40,825
I'm alive!

736
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:45,830
I'm alive!

737
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,802
Yee-haw!

738
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,514
Say "uncle"! Say "uncle"!

739
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:11,981
Don't start what you can't finish!

740
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:15,776
Quit hitting yourself!

741
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,737
Quit hitting yourself!

742
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:21,365
Oh, water tastes good, yes!

743
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:24,285
Glub, glub.

744
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,583
This isn't over yet.

745
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:34,795
There's something I missed.
Some clue or motive I've overlooked.

746
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,548
And that motive is...

747
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,009
...plah!

748
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,469
Think!

749
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,888
Someone wants the tribes
to destroy each other.

750
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,557
There must be something
valuable in this equation.

751
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,226
Perhaps we should meditate, Spike.

752
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:52,563
For it is said that
when seeking answers, one must...

753
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:55,399
...quiet the soul in order
to hear them.

754
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,740
What is it the Wachati possess...

755
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:06,369
...that is of great value
to other men...

756
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,413
...besides the princess
with the amazing rack?

757
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:23,636
Alrighty, then.

758
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:06,804
Oh.

759
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,932
You're back?

760
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,894
You can dispense with the smallpox,
all-knowing one.

761
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:17,606
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.

762
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,317
Very well.

763
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,278
What answer do you seek?

764
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:24,780
What do the Wachati possess...

765
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,616
...that is of great
value to civilized man?

766
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:31,620
The medallion will lead you
to the answer.

767
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,375
You do still have
the medallion, don't you?

768
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:39,670
Medallion? Why, surely.

769
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:42,673
I left it back, uh...

770
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:44,800
...with my body.

771
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,635
Your aura...

772
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,096
...is weakening.

773
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:51,807
Okay! I threw it in a cave!

774
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:55,561
What do you want from me?
What are you? Mr. Perfect?

775
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,104
Where is it?

776
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,273
It's probably lying...

777
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:02,026
...in a big pile of...

778
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:20,002
Guano!

779
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:24,131
They have guano!

780
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:36,685
Like...

781
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,896
...a glove.

782
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,901
Hi, Chief!

783
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,695
Appreciate your meeting me here.

784
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:50,032
Let's go kick some...

785
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,410
...consulate butt.

786
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:04,838
Hello, Ace.

787
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:09,510
- You want your money?
- Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.

788
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,513
I've come for the sacred bat.
Where is it?

789
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,808
Why, whatever can you mean?

790
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,309
Guano!

791
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:18,686
Hello!

792
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,854
Does poop ring a bell?

793
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,567
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate...

794
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:27,319
"... producing 84 percent
of the world's fertilizer...

795
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:30,030
"... a $1.4-billion industry. "

796
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,283
That's what this war is about.

797
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:37,496
You can't take possession of the caves
while the Wachati inhabit the area.

798
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:39,915
And you want that dookie so bad...

799
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,500
...you can taste it.

800
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:42,835
I thought that-

801
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,296
Yes, thank you, Fulton.

802
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:50,551
That's a fine theory, Mr. Ventura.

803
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:52,886
What's it got to do with me?

804
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:55,848
I thought you'd...

805
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,641
...never ask.

806
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:04,189
When I met you, there was
a white substance on your shoe.

807
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:06,942
Yesterday, I saw the same
substance outside the hut...

808
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:09,987
...and it hit me that
the Great White Bat has white guano.

809
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:13,032
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

810
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,576
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

811
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:16,994
Let me run that back for you.

812
01:14:23,418 --> 01:14:26,128
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!

813
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:29,423
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

814
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:32,384
Damn, I'm good!

815
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,386
Can you feel that, huh?

816
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:37,348
Can you feel it, Captain Compost?

817
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:42,061
The day of redemption is at hand!

818
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,938
Repent!

819
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:48,859
And thou shall be saved.

820
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:52,029
Very good.

821
01:14:54,616 --> 01:14:55,949
Very good.

822
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,619
I believe you've solved the case.

823
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:02,790
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.

824
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,543
If you are the slime behind
this little flim-flam...

825
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,295
...why, oh, why...

826
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,340
...did you hire me?

827
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,677
I'm afraid there'll be
an investigation after the war.

828
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:16,095
You were my alibi...

829
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:19,306
...to prove I'd done
everything I could to stop it.

830
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,641
Arrest him.

831
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:22,726
Arrest him!

832
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:26,647
Please arrest him.

833
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,484
Simon says, "Arrest him. "

834
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:43,080
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura.

835
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,500
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura.

836
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,505
Shall I stick him on the wall?

837
01:15:51,715 --> 01:15:55,217
Heh, no, I don't think it'll be
necessary, Gahjii.

838
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:59,680
Mr. Ventura has very cleverly stolen
the sacred bat of the Wachati.

839
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:04,268
Unfortunately, we were unable
to recover it in time to stop the war.

840
01:16:05,854 --> 01:16:06,937
Hit the lights!

841
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,775
The switch is on the wall
beside you! Go for it!

842
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:23,120
Flick it!

843
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:30,544
Alrighty, then.
Shall we go to jail?

844
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,223
What are you? H.R. Shove-n-Stuff?

845
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,143
Get in!

846
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,480
Just one more thing.

847
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,447
What are you doing?

848
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,331
Stop it! I said, stop it!

849
01:17:16,424 --> 01:17:18,258
To the jungle, Boba!

850
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:35,150
Friends...

851
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:36,527
...rodents...

852
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:38,237
...quadrupeds!

853
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,781
Lend me your ears!

854
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,500
Imbecile! You let him get away!

855
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,419
You don't seem to understand.
The tribe will be killed.

856
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,755
Remind me to send a sympathy card.

857
01:17:56,965 --> 01:17:58,590
We're going to get the bastard.

858
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,717
There's nothing he can do now.

859
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:03,720
We've got the bat, and it's nearly noon.

860
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,990
What the hell's going on?

861
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:06,033
You see...

862
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:10,245
...humans and animals
can live in harmony!

863
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:23,425
Whoa.

864
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,802
Sorry for the delay, Ace.

865
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:32,059
Hey, poachers!

866
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:36,855
Say hello to my stinky little friend!

867
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,667
Get out! Get out!

868
01:19:57,919 --> 01:20:00,003
Not so fast, Sally!

869
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:05,175
Get it away!

870
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,236
Aw, he wants to go off-road.

871
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:12,868
Aw.

872
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,537
Nobody wants to play with me.

873
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:23,879
Loser!

874
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:42,064
From the consulate, right?

875
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:44,441
This is weird.

876
01:22:47,338 --> 01:22:48,380
Blah.

877
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,008
Noon.

878
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,138
The Wachati.

879
01:22:59,517 --> 01:23:01,518
The spirit will overcome.

880
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,479
The spirit will overcome.

881
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:42,225
Headhunters!

882
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:06,708
Shikaka!

883
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,597
Coming through. Clear a path, people!

884
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:54,923
Yuck!

885
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:17,737
Huh?

886
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:57,652
They will now consummate
the marriage as the tribe watches.

887
01:25:57,862 --> 01:26:01,698
Well done, Ace.
You must be extremely proud.

888
01:26:02,116 --> 01:26:03,491
Pride is an abomination.

889
01:26:04,035 --> 01:26:05,493
One must forego the self...

890
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,496
...to attain spiritual creaminess...

891
01:26:08,998 --> 01:26:11,499
...and avoid the chewy chunks...

892
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:13,710
...of degradation.

893
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:26,389
- What's that he's he saying?
- I think he's saying, "She's not a virgin. "

894
01:26:27,892 --> 01:26:29,517
They can tell that?

895
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,142
