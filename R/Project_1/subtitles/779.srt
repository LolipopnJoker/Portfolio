1
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,940
Two o'clock in Memphis WHBQ.

2
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,318
George TCBing
with August Super Tuesday.

3
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,363
The man says H and H,
hot and humid all afternoon, now 92.

4
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,908
The heart and soul
of rock 'n' roll going for 97.

5
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,327
- Ricky! Son!
- What?

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,579
Come back here.

7
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,457
Won't be back till late.
I want you in by dark.

8
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,543
I want you to watch out for your brother.

9
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,670
- I can watch out for myself.
- Can not.

10
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,755
Don't worry, Mom, I'll take care of him.

11
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,007
How come you always have
to watch out for me?

12
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,718
Because I'm older, stupid.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,594
Mom, he's calling me stupid.

14
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,221
Would y'all hush up?

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,266
Don't be reading any more
of them scary comics.

16
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,268
- You hear me, Ricky?
- Whatever.

17
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,228
He can't sleep.

18
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,941
Shoot, I'm gonna miss my bus.
I'm gonna be late again.

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,235
I'm gonna get docked for sure.

20
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,698
There's some macaroni and cheese
in the cabinet, okay?

21
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,283
All right.

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,870
- Got your lunch?
- Thank you, baby.

23
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,830
Keys?

24
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,249
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,252
Exact change for the bus?

26
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,546
Oh, shoot, baby. Thank you.

27
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,549
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

28
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,845
- You stay out of them woods.
- Okay, Mom.

29
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,055
You hear me, Mark?

30
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,224
Bye, baby.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,353
- Come on, Mark, give me a cigarette.
- No way.

32
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,314
Mark, wait.

33
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,109
- Catch me and I'll give you one.
- I can't run that fast.

34
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,240
Catch me.

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,201
Wait up, Mark.

36
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,328
Better hurry or you'll
never get your smoke.

37
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,246
We're not supposed to go in the woods.

38
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,624
Go home, I'll smoke them myself.

39
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,710
Come get me.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,172
- Come on.
- Wait up, Mark.

41
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,933
Come on, Ricky. Catch me.

42
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,768
Come on, give me one.

43
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,978
No way, pal.

44
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,064
I'll tell Mom.

45
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,107
Tattletale.

46
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,402
- You know the deal.
- Yeah. If I tell anyone, you'll kick my ass.

47
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,447
That's right. And if I catch you smoking
more than one a day...

48
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,283
- I know, you'll kick my ass again.
- That's right.

49
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,204
- How many do you smoke a day?
- Only one. I'm smart.

50
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,206
- Will one a day kill me?
- Nah!

51
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,584
Not any time soon, but more than that
and you could be in deep shit.

52
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,503
- How many does Mom smoke?
- Forty.

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,382
- And what about Dad?
- A hundred a day.

54
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,008
Oh, he's gonna die soon?

55
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,761
I wish. Sit there.

56
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,601
Don't try to swallow the smoke yet,
because I know you're not ready for that.

57
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,272
You'll just choke
and puke all over the place.

58
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,987
Suck a little and blow.

59
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,704
Told you not to swallow the smoke.

60
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,458
This is easy.

61
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,420
Yeah, that's why you look
like you're gonna puke.

62
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,838
Do not.

63
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,730
Where's he going?

64
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:06,954
What's he doing?

65
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,010
Damn, damn.

66
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,265
Damn.

67
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,613
Damn. Goddamn it.

68
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,868
Son of a bitch.

69
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,205
Jesus Christ, he's trying to kill himself.

70
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,706
How do you know?

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,416
I seen it on TV once.

72
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:57,129
- Why do you think he wants to kill himself?
- How am I supposed to know, stupid?

73
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,132
- Well, let's get the hell out of here.
- No.

74
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,511
You stay here. Okay?
If you move, I'll kick your ass.

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,888
What are you gonna do?

76
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,225
Mark.

77
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,268
Mark.

78
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,340
- Come on, let's go.
- No. We gotta make sure he's okay.

79
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,509
- Think he's dead?
- Don't know.

80
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,851
Damn.

81
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,190
Nothing works. Nothing works.

82
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,157
He is crazy as hell.

83
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,787
Damn it. Damn.

84
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,914
- Let's go, please. Come on.
- No, we can't.

85
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,127
If he kills himself and we know anything about
it, we can be in all kinds of bullshit.

86
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,462
We won't tell no one.

87
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,424
- Just let him die.
- We're not leaving till I say we're leaving.

88
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,385
- Stay down, Mark.
- Stay here.

89
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,221
Mark.

90
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,909
Let him die.

91
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,916
You bastard.

92
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,585
You bastard!

93
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,339
Come on.

94
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,342
- Get in there. Get in there.
- No.

95
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,385
Get in there.

96
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,686
I said get...
Don't you touch that damn door!

97
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,903
Sorry, kid.

98
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,697
You had to be a cute ass.

99
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:33,160
Had to stick your dirty little nose
in my business, didn't you?

100
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,789
So I think we should die together.

101
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:42,128
Just you and me, pal. Off to la-la land.

102
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,799
Sweet dreams.

103
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,305
- You want that gun?
- No, sir.

104
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,432
- Why you looking at it?
- I wasn't, sir.

105
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,351
Don't you lie to me!

106
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,772
I'm crazy. If you lie to me, I'll kill you.

107
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,899
Please don't kill me, sir.

108
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,610
I got my mother and my little brother
to take care of.

109
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,987
I'll give you a choice.

110
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,864
I can blow your brains out...

111
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,074
and end it now...

112
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,327
or we could wait and let the gas do it.

113
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,454
You decide.

114
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,428
What's your name?

115
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,640
Mark. Mark Sway.

116
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,559
Jerome Clifford.

117
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,519
Attorney at law.

118
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,106
So since we're both
pretty tight right now...

119
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,109
you can call me Romey.

120
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,824
Listen. Hear that bird?

121
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,329
I drove all the way from New Orleans
to hear those stupid birds. Grew up here.

122
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,335
I played in these woods.
Now I'm gonna die here too.

123
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,672
Why are you doing this?

124
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,426
Because if I don't kill myself, he will.

125
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,929
- Who's he?
- The Blade.

126
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,432
Barry "The Blade" Muldano.

127
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,395
Why does this Blade guy wanna kill you?

128
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,362
Because I know...

129
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,949
I know where
the proverbial body is buried.

130
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,617
Whose body?

131
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,878
See, my client killed
Senator Boyd Boyette...

132
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,338
and hid the body.

133
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,259
So now my client, he wants to kill me.

134
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,887
You know where the body's buried?
The body's buried...

135
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,181
He hid the body...

136
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,899
He's still buried there,
can you believe it?

137
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,986
They haven't found it yet.
FBI's dug up half of New Orleans.

138
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,030
They haven't found it,
they're not gonna find it, no way.

139
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,412
Yeah. Oh, yeah, Mark, go for it.

140
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,038
Yeah, Mark, go ahead.

141
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:27,543
Go ahead, Mark, pull the trigger.
Yeah. Pull the trigger.

142
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,966
Pull the goddamn trigger! Pull it!

143
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,510
Pull the trigger!

144
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,345
Pull it!

145
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,143
Pretty nifty piece?

146
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,186
Hell, I don't even know if it works.

147
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,243
Let's see if it works.

148
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,206
It works!

149
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,584
- Shit.
- It works. Hey, get over here!

150
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,880
- Ricky.
- I told you not to go anywhere!

151
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,424
Ricky, damn you, come on.

152
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,260
Hey, Mark! Son of a bitch.

153
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,435
Hey!

154
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,562
Where are you?

155
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,981
Goddamn kid!

156
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,192
Hey!

157
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,695
Mark!

158
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,323
Come back here, kid!

159
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,078
If the Blade finds out what I told you,
he's gonna kill you anyway.

160
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,664
You hear me, kid?

161
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,796
Mark, where are you?

162
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,996
- Put my drink on my bill, babe.
- All right.

163
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,305
Come on, boys, dance with me.

164
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,158
I've been waiting a half hour.
Where the hell's Romey?

165
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,995
- Damn feds are on my ass.
- God, Mr. Muldano.

166
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,707
I don't know.
He hasn't been in here all day.

167
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,836
Now, Claudette, God hates a liar.

168
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,713
That's what my mother always said.

169
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,174
I'm not lying, honest to God,
I haven't seen him.

170
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,468
I don't know where he is.

171
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,386
You know, Claudette...

172
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,805
you're a very pretty woman.

173
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,766
Well, thank you, Mr. Muldano.

174
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,272
You wanna stay pretty, don't you?

175
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,066
Oh, please.

176
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,818
I'm just a secretary.

177
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,946
Listen, honest to God,
I don't know where he is.

178
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,157
He doesn't always tell me
where he's going...

179
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,408
Put your hand in there.

180
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,786
Put your hand in here!

181
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,748
I don't... I don't know. Honest to...

182
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,629
Put your hand in. Come on, put it in.

183
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,299
Please. I don't know where he is.

184
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,218
Come on.

185
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,224
Mr. Muldano.

186
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,436
You know, Claudette, I believe
you really didn't know where he was.

187
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,647
- Lift.
- Get another sample here.

188
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,690
Damn.

189
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,527
What's inside here?

190
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,695
- Is this something here?
- Check the hood.

191
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,198
Take a look at this.

192
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,117
- There you go.
- Watch yourself.

193
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,494
Bring it on through here.

194
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,334
What's up, kid?

195
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,674
What are you so scared of?
Did you have a bad dream?

196
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,803
You're scaring your mama.
Get your thumb out of your...

197
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,809
Come on, baby. Talk to your mama.

198
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,145
Where have you been?
What the hell is wrong with your brother?

199
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,316
What have you done now?
What the hell is going on?

200
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,278
- Boy witnessed a suicide, ma'am.
- He what?

201
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,657
Oh, well, me and Ricky was just
out in the woods playing...

202
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,077
and we seen this guy and he was dead
and he had a gun in his mouth.

203
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,787
Oh, my dear God.

204
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,415
And I ran home and called 911.

205
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,166
What happened to Ricky?

206
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,712
He just laid on the bed and started
sucking his thumb and wouldn't talk.

207
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,591
This is Sergeant Hardy. We need the
paramedics over here at Sway's trailer now.

208
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,718
This boy needs to be hospitalized.

209
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,469
I don't have health insurance.

210
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,139
That's okay,
St. Peter's will take indigent cases.

211
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,351
- Pack some things for the hospital tonight.
- What, like clothes? What?

212
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,819
You telling the truth, son?
About what you all saw.

213
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,821
Don't you believe me?

214
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,324
I didn't say I didn't believe you.

215
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,451
Just seems strange, that's all.

216
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,912
You called 911,
but you wouldn't leave your name.

217
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,790
Well, I was scared.
It was the first dead guy I ever saw.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,085
Why'd you sneak back and hide
up in the woods where I found you?

219
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,297
I don't know.
I just wanted to see, I guess.

220
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,261
Did you talk to the man
before he killed himself?

221
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,597
No, I never talked to him.

222
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,224
Name "Jerome Clifford"
mean anything to you?

223
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,101
No.

224
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,649
You know, I found some
fresh cigarette butts near the body.

225
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,151
Same brand as your mama smokes.

226
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:30,739
Somehow I can't see you finding the body
and then deciding to have a cigarette.

227
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,535
Look, officer, all that happened was
we was just walking through the woods...

228
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,579
when we found Romey dead. That's all.

229
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,040
- Who's Romey?
- That's the guy's name, isn't it?

230
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,876
I said, Jerome Clifford.

231
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,753
Whoever heard of the name Romey?

232
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm Dr. Greenway. Is this your son?

233
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,609
Yeah, he's my son.

234
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,569
- What's his name?
- Ricky Sway.

235
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,073
- How long has he been this way?
- I didn't find him, my other boy, Mark, did.

236
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,326
You found him, Mark? Ricky?
Is that what you called him? Ricky?

237
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,621
Jerome R. Clifford,
New Orleans attorney, was found dead...

238
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,083
in an apparent suicide
outside Memphis just hours ago.

239
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,795
The famed Mafia lawyer was due
to defend the alleged Mafia hit man...

240
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,339
Barry "The Blade" Muldano
next month...

241
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,260
in the increasingly notorious case
of still-missing Louisiana senator...

242
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,388
Boyd Boyette, now presumed dead.

243
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,181
It was going to be tough...

244
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,350
to build a case against Muldano
without a body...

245
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,145
but surely Clifford's death
will mean more delays.

246
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,397
As one informed source tells me...

247
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,692
the plot thickens and sickens
for U.S. Attorney Roy Foltrigg.

248
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,611
No body, no case, no conviction.

249
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,282
And that means no front-page pictures
that Attorney Foltrigg likes so much.

250
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,327
No CNN interviews,
no speedy ascent to Capitol Hill.

251
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,455
Sorry, Reverend Roy.

252
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,375
- I never liked that old cow.
- We're here, Roy.

253
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:12,966
He tried it first with a garden hose attached
to the tailpipe, but it didn't work.

254
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,426
He was probably too stoned.

255
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,053
He was full of downers
and about a gallon of whiskey.

256
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,932
Guess he figured he'd swallow a bullet
for dessert. Single gunshot to the head.

257
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,435
- Cheap snub-nosed .38.
- A definite suicide, Roy.

258
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
Damn him.
I called Romey two days ago, I said:

259
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,815
"I have enough evidence
to pierce client-attorney privilege...

260
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,527
and put your fat ass on the stand."
I was bullshitting him, of course.

261
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,030
I was trying to get him nervous,
see if he'd talk.

262
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,200
Didn't know he'd blow his scalp off.
He must've known where that body's at.

263
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,870
Oh, he's never gonna tell us now.
Without that body we got no case.

264
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,165
- How's the weather in Memphis?
- It's hot, Roy.

265
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,585
Sprite?

266
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,804
- What happened to your face?
- I got in a fight at school.

267
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,515
It's summer. There's no school.

268
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,850
I meant, a kid from my school.

269
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,727
- Who was the kid?
- Why?

270
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:10,524
Why? Because I'm a cop.
It's my job to ask questions.

271
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,693
Besides, I think your
story's full of holes.

272
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,530
I believe you were in that car
before Clifford died.

273
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,865
What does "indigent" mean?

274
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,742
Indigent?

275
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,494
That means "poor."

276
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,914
Like you and your mother
and your little brother.

277
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,749
So you better tell the truth...

278
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,126
hope it snaps him out of it.

279
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,461
Otherwise...

280
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:37,008
he could lie in some institution
for dirt-poor crazy people...

281
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,304
with padded walls and cockroaches...

282
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,058
and chained to some filthy bed
with snakes...

283
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,936
Mark...

284
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,189
I'm Karen. Will you come with me?

285
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,531
- Bye.
- Bye.

286
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,870
- We're gonna have to watch him.
- What are you gonna do?

287
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,290
We're just gonna watch for
now. Sometimes just a good night's sleep...

288
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,001
and they wake up,
they don't know what's going on.

289
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,544
His reflexes seem to be good.

290
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,212
- That's good.
- Yeah.

291
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,340
Mark, honey, Ricky's real sick.

292
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,927
- What's the matter with him?
- It's called post-traumatic stress syndrome.

293
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,930
Sometimes a person sees something
they just can't deal with.

294
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,769
I'm always telling Mark,
"No horror movies. No scary comics."

295
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,230
Not for Ricky.

296
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,984
- He's always been tender that way.
- Easy, now.

297
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,695
You try to protect them,
there's just so bad out there.

298
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,282
Why don't you get some rest
yourself? Why don't you lie down and rest?

299
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,911
There's nothing more you can do.
We're just gonna watch him.

300
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,205
You've had a rough day.
Just lie down in here. Stay with him.

301
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,806
Boy, that's a bad injury. What happened?

302
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,018
Car wreck. Got hit by an oil truck.
Nut run a stop sign.

303
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,772
My name's Gill Beale, I'm a lawyer.
You got a problem, I can fix it.

304
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,691
I specialize in car wrecks,
especially large trucks.

305
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:21,529
Let's see what you got. A broken leg,
a concussion, a couple of busted ribs...

306
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,657
- And a broken collarbone.
- Great.

307
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,660
I can get you at least 600,000.
We'll file suit tomorrow.

308
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,374
Did I say six? Six is just for starters.
Here, check me out.

309
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,709
Call up Gill Beale,
you'll see who's for real.

310
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,796
More lawyers around this place
than there are doctors.

311
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,925
Now, don't be that way. I'm gonna
outrun that little buggy of yours.

312
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,030
- Wait till you get a load of this guy.
- All right.

313
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,825
Mr. Foltrigg, Jason McThune, FBI.

314
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:10,245
Welcome to Memphis, home of the king.
City of the good abode.

315
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,871
What do you know, McThune?

316
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,792
Kid's name is Mark Sway. He told Memphis
P.D. that he and his younger brother...

317
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,504
just stumbled on the body in the woods,
and then ran and called the cops.

318
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,214
- I think he's lying.
- Why's that?

319
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,258
We lifted his prints off a Sprite can...

320
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
they match prints that
were all over the car, inside and out.

321
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,222
I think he was in that car
before Clifford shot himself.

322
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,267
And he was there for a while
because of the number of prints.

323
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,394
- Why would the kid lie?
- One, he's scared.

324
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,105
Two, he's a kid, they always lie.
Adults are the enemy.

325
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:41,026
And three, maybe Romey Clifford told him
something he knows he should not know.

326
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,570
People hate to die with secrets.
That's good work, McThune.

327
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:47,240
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm gonna keep it up, believe me.

328
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,578
Listen, I'm sick and tired of chasing
Elvis sightings.

329
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:54,080
I wanna get out of here.
Is there any room on your staff?

330
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,999
- Where you wanna go?
- Anywhere you go.

331
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,959
Gotta do something
about that hair first.

332
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,169
Yes, sir.

333
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,546
- Meantime, I wanna talk to that child.
- Right away, sir.

334
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,679
Dr. Greenway wants to see you.

335
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,140
How old are you?

336
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,476
Twenty-four. Why?

337
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,352
Are you married?

338
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,521
Sometimes.

339
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,693
I don't know nothing,
but he looks better to me.

340
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,405
I think if we get him home and get him
in his own bed, he's gonna be fine.

341
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,324
I don't know why you just can't...

342
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,077
- Mrs. Sway.
- ...give him some medicine or something.

343
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,705
Can't you just give him a shot
or something? I gotta go to work.

344
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,084
- Our trailer park takes rent by the week.
- Listen to me.

345
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:44,589
Right now, it's as if Ricky's in a dark
place and he's trying to find the way out.

346
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,716
Now, what's very
important... Listen to me.

347
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,636
What's very important
is that when he finds that way out...

348
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,430
the first thing he sees is your face.

349
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,850
Let's hope it'll only take a day or two.

350
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,854
There goes another job. Must be
damn near setting some kind of record.

351
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,690
I'll call your employer,
I'm sure he's gonna understand...

352
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,609
My employer runs a sweatshop, doctor.

353
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:08,029
He will not send flowers.
He will not understand.

354
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,906
You could take shifts.

355
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,367
- Perhaps the father could come in...?
- Ex-father.

356
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,536
And you keep him away from Ricky.

357
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,122
- Now hush.
- Okay, Mom, I'm sorry.

358
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,251
I don't know if you've seen this...

359
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,588
but there are policemen downstairs
and reporters.

360
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,757
The FBI is coming
to interview Mark at 10.

361
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,260
Mom, I don't wanna talk to them.

362
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,179
I'm gonna wind up like Ricky
if they don't stop bugging me.

363
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,308
- They're not gonna go away.
- I don't give a flying shit about the FBI.

364
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,686
- You are getting on my last nerve.
- Mrs. Sway...

365
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,897
Would you sit down and hush up?
I don't know what the hell to do.

366
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:46,442
- Can I see you outside?
- I feel like I'm losing my mind.

367
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,362
Telling me to wait for my boy to...
Some crap.

368
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,367
Mom?

369
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:58,037
- This boy.
- I'm sorry.

370
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,499
I'm sorry too.

371
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:05,253
I'll think of something
to get us out of this, I promise.

372
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,299
Hey. You and Ricky just found
that guy dead.

373
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,176
Right?

374
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,221
Come on now, there's nothing
you ain't telling me, is there?

375
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,142
Dr. Greenway wants to start you on Valium,
Mrs. Sway.

376
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,852
Those cost extra?

377
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,479
Yeah, don't worry about that,
just take these here.

378
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,023
- Both of them?
- Both of them.

379
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,816
You're gonna start feeling better.

380
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,693
- Don't go far.
- Okay, Mom.

381
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,864
FBI?

382
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:37,035
You know, I hear that they're sending
the Reverend Roy Foltrigg himself.

383
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,245
That's bad. That's...

384
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,040
You know that the FBI...

385
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,126
puts kids in jail if they break the law?

386
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:49,380
And if a kid has been involved
in a murder...

387
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,092
they got a special little
kid-sized electric chair.

388
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,095
I saw it once. It was about... so high.

389
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:01,059
Did you know that when somebody gets
electrocuted, the current is so strong...

390
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,270
it makes the blood in the veins boil.

391
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,440
God.

392
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,734
Fry you up just like a piece of bacon.

393
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,488
You're the only pig around here.

394
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,114
See you later, Markus.

395
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,210
Are you here to question Mark Sway?

396
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,379
I beg your pardon?

397
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,965
Are you here in Memphis...

398
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,384
to improve your own position
regarding the case, sir?

399
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,304
My real interest is to see justice done.
Every one of you knows that about me.

400
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,265
Are you ever gonna find that body?

401
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,226
We're gonna locate the senator's body.
You can count on that.

402
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,561
What do you think Mark Sway knows?

403
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,845
You ain't gonna run here by yourself.

404
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,597
- What do you want, boy?
- I need to see Mr. Beale.

405
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,434
- Where are your parents?
- Where are yours?

406
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,520
- Are you even injured?
- Do I look injured?

407
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,772
Well, we only do injuries.

408
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,568
Well, I'll just go get hit by a truck
and come back.

409
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,196
You all shut up too.

410
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,751
- Yes?
- Hell, no.

411
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,174
What the hell's wrong
with this damn window?

412
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,425
Where you going?

413
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:01,220
I'm gonna pick up something to eat
and then swing by the post office.

414
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,264
All right.

415
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,939
Hey. When's your boss coming back?

416
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,566
May I help you?

417
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,027
No, I need to see Reggie Love.

418
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,570
Why, may I ask?

419
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,864
Well, that's between me and Mr. Love.

420
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,450
I'm Reggie Love.

421
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,119
Pssh, a woman lawyer, oh, great.

422
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,039
I think so. Now, why is it
you think you want a lawyer?

423
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,125
I don't want a lawyer. I hate lawyers.

424
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,295
Every lawyer I ever had
just shafted me and my mom.

425
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:38,299
I said I need a lawyer.
But I don't know about no woman.

426
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,928
Well, this lawyer that shafted you,
what was her name?

427
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,971
It wasn't no her, it was a he.

428
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,766
Right.

429
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,395
Well, why is it that you think
you need a lawyer?

430
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,064
- Because I'm Mark Sway.
- So?

431
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,276
You know, the kid who found the dead guy.
I'm famous. Don't you read the paper?

432
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,362
You still haven't answered my question.

433
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,032
Because I'm supposed to talk to some
Reverend Roy guy in 10 minutes.

434
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,244
- Reverend Roy Foltrigg?
- Yeah, why's everybody call him that?

435
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,496
He loves to quote the scriptures
in court...

436
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,873
and knows the Bible
better than God himself.

437
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,418
- Does he win a lot?
- Always.

438
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:17,338
Why can't everyone just leave me alone?
Some sweaty fat guy blows his head off...

439
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:19,799
- Why did you lie to the police?
- I didn't.

440
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,386
Well, it says here in this paper
that you found Jerome Clifford dead.

441
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,430
I did.

442
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:31,185
Dead men don't sweat, now do they?

443
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,237
If you was my lawyer...

444
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:44,532
and I told you something,
could you ever repeat it?

445
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,493
No. What is it you wanna tell me?

446
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:52,707
Well, that Clifford guy came driving up
in his big black car...

447
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:57,462
and me and Ricky, we snuck up to watch,
and that Clifford guy got out...

448
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,965
and he put a gun in his mouth
and he blew the back of his head out.

449
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,301
So you did see Jerome Clifford alive?

450
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,013
- Yeah.
- Why'd you lie to the police?

451
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,891
I don't know.
I mean, I was just scared, I guess.

452
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,478
My little brother's in a coma
and my mom might lose her job.

453
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,147
The FBI's after me
but I don't know nothing.

454
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,565
You would lie too.

455
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,903
Well, you're right,
you do need a lawyer, Mark Sway.

456
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,908
There are a few male lawyers down the hall.
You want me to recommend one?

457
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,037
- How many cases have you won?
- More than I lost.

458
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,957
- How much do you cost?
- How much you got?

459
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,602
Nine thirty-two. Our boy has arrived.

460
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,701
Thank God your mother,
my sister, is dead, Barry.

461
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:14,163
Having a son this stupid
would have killed her for sure.

462
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:19,085
I told you not to hit Boyette, you did.

463
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,172
I told you not to tell Romey too much,
you did.

464
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:27,009
I hope it hurt that fat bastard.
I hope that bullet was slow.

465
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,929
I hope he felt the top of his head
pull right off his face.

466
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,975
Two kids found him, Barry,
maybe before he finished the job.

467
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,728
- Yeah, I know, I seen it on TV.
- There's a chance he might have talked.

468
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,649
Tell me Boyette's body's somewhere
the cops can't find.

469
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,193
The cops are not gonna find the body.

470
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,653
Move the body, Barry.

471
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,281
I will, Uncle Johnny.

472
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,242
Only I can't right now.

473
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,952
Why?

474
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,375
Where it's at, the body,
the cops are swarming all over the place.

475
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:02,211
Don't worry,
they're not gonna find the body.

476
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,841
If that kid knows anything, he's not talking,
otherwise I wouldn't be standing here.

477
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,719
I'm going to Memphis
and I'm gonna take care of those kids.

478
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,220
I'll tell you what you do.

479
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,848
You just sit on your dumb ass.

480
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,559
Gronke.

481
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,812
I want you in Memphis.

482
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,276
Come.

483
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,697
Oh, you must be Mark.

484
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,990
Hi, Mark.

485
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,659
Jason McThune, Memphis FBI.

486
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,412
This is Larry Trumann
from New Orleans FBI.

487
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,749
This is Thomas Fink,
assistant United States attorney...

488
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,043
and Mr. Foltrigg,
United States attorney.

489
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,503
Both from southern Louisiana.

490
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,963
Sit down, son.

491
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,177
- Come on over here, Mark. Sit down.
- There you are.

492
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,139
We expected your mother. Where is she?

493
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,853
She's upstairs with my little brother.
She can't leave in case he wakes up.

494
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,483
But, you know, we could hold
this off for a couple of days.

495
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,944
No, Mark,
let's talk a few minutes, just us.

496
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,867
- You nervous?
- A little.

497
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,538
- Do I need a lawyer?
- What for?

498
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,790
To protect my rights.

499
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,708
No, you been watching too much TV.

500
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,419
We just wanna ask you some questions.
You can trust us.

501
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,756
Lawyers just get in the way.
They object to everything.

502
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,008
What if I don't answer your questions?

503
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,387
We might have to take you downtown.
Might take your mother too.

504
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,514
- Will my mother get in trouble?
- Maybe.

505
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:41,686
You ever hear of obstruction of justice,
Mark? It's a federal offense.

506
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,188
It means if a man knows something
about a crime...

507
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,275
and withholds information from the FBI
or the police, well, he might be punished.

508
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,653
You know,
sent to jail or something like that.

509
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:55,449
So what you're trying to say is, is if I don't
answer your questions, I could go to jail?

510
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,701
Maybe.

511
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:02,456
Gosh, man, if y'all was in my place,
wouldn't y'all want a lawyer?

512
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,584
Hell no, they're a pain in the ass.
You don't need a lawyer.

513
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,962
Pain in the ass?

514
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,672
But aren't you a lawyer?

515
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,467
Jerome Clifford wasn't really dead
when you found him, was he?

516
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:17,805
- Yes, he was.
- We know you were in that car, Mark.

517
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,474
You see that?

518
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,978
You and Romey had a nice long chat,
didn't you?

519
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,149
What'd y'all talk about?
Did you talk about life? Talk about love?

520
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,235
Y'all talk about where bodies are buried?

521
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,404
I have to go to the bathroom.

522
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,573
Answer the question first, please, Mark.

523
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,491
I've gotta go bad. Please?

524
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,909
Well, you'd better go.

525
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,745
Thanks.

526
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,915
You don't need no stinking lawyer.

527
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,170
Hell no. This boy's about ready
to tell all. You know where Muldano's at?

528
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,257
- We're on his ass 24 hours a day.
- Better grab him so he don't skip town.

529
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,218
Don't mark up his face.
We can do the press conference here.

530
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,762
Hold on till we grab Muldano.

531
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:01,056
I wanna make sure those affidavits are set
so he can't make bail.

532
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,393
Did you get my makeup off the plane?
I'm gonna need Pancake number 17.

533
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,645
Doughnuts. Doughnuts.
Give me that telephone.

534
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,356
Press loves coffee and doughnuts.
See what you can do.

535
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,150
Where we gonna put me?
Down by the flags?

536
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,360
I think I look best
in front of these glass bricks...

537
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,530
behind a big bank of microphones.
That always looks nice, doesn't it?

538
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,075
- I'll call you back.
- Come in, Mark.

539
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,369
- Polite kid.
- Yeah, he's a good boy.

540
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,125
- Oh, keep your seats.
- We're in a meeting.

541
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,920
- I think you're in the wrong room.
- I don't think so.

542
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:35,591
My name is Reggie Love,
I'm an attorney and I represent Mark Sway.

543
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,345
May I see some ID, please?

544
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
When did he hire you?

545
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,683
I don't think that's really
any of your business, now is it?

546
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,519
Gonna have to forgive us, Ms. Love.

547
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,772
You're so pretty, how could anybody
mistake you for a lawyer?

548
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,275
- Please, call me Reggie...
- Reggie.

549
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,527
Roy.

550
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:58,656
So did you in fact...
Oh, please, sit down.

551
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:04,662
Attempt to interrogate my client
outside the presence of his mother, Jason?

552
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,163
No.

553
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,999
He tells me that you did, Lawrence.

554
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,001
He's confused.

555
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,212
We assumed his mother
was on her way down.

556
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,674
- Where were you during this?
- Oh, that's not really relevant.

557
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,845
Did you advise him
that he should talk to an attorney, Thomas?

558
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,096
- No... Yes.
- Did I...?

559
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,933
Remember, once, Larry
Mark said something, or I did, about TV...

560
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:30,813
and then Mark said that
he might need a lawyer...

561
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,858
and we...
I thought he was just joking.

562
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,986
So he never asked you guys
if he needed a lawyer?

563
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,196
I don't remember it that way.

564
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,699
Did you advise him
of his Miranda rights?

565
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,911
No, what for? He's not a criminal.
We just wanted to ask him a few questions.

566
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,415
You did attempt to interrogate him
outside the presence of his mother?

567
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,125
- No.
- Definitely not.

568
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,877
No way.

569
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,172
Bullshit.

570
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,052
Tread carefully. We know your client
lied about being in that car.

571
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,723
I think that's a bit of the pot
calling the kettle black.

572
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,853
- Do I need a lawyer?
- What for?

573
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,062
To protect my rights.

574
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,981
No, you been watching too much TV.

575
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,483
We just wanna ask some questions.
You can trust us.

576
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:21,071
Lawyers just get in the way.
They object to everything.

577
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,658
- You wired the kid.
- It's nothing personal, Lawrence.

578
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,201
Take your mother too.

579
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,454
You attempted to interrogate a child...

580
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,498
outside the presence of his mother
and without her consent.

581
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,501
He asked you if he needed a lawyer
and you said no...

582
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,880
stating as one of your reasons
that lawyers are a pain in the ass.

583
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,840
I'd like to confer with my client...

584
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,927
and meet with you people in my office
tomorrow around 3:00.

585
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:49,183
And if I need anything from you boys,
like the truth, well I expect to get it.

586
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,477
I catch you lying again...

587
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,228
I'm gonna use the tape.

588
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,232
That's blackmail, Ms. Love.

589
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,859
Indict me, Reverend Roy.

590
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,115
Still want those doughnuts?

591
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,827
Shut up, McThune. Goddamn.

592
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,830
- You want a cigarette?
- Oh, no thanks, I just quit.

593
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,792
There's been a mistake, ma'am.
We can't afford no lawyer.

594
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,212
- Don't worry about the money.
- My pig boss fired me this morning.

595
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,590
I mean, my baby's in a coma
and he fires me.

596
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,469
- Don't tell Mark.
- Just one day and he fired you? He is a pig.

597
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:26,720
Sucks.

598
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,349
Wasn't much of a job anyways.
Five bucks an hour at a lamp factory.

599
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,810
How long you been working there?

600
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,938
- How long you been...?
- Six months.

601
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,901
- Lord, I can't keep my head on straight.
- You're doing fine.

602
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,737
I like your ring.

603
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,406
They real diamonds?

604
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,159
Lord, no. It's semi-precious.

605
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,371
You got kids?

606
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,460
Gosh, you must have been just a baby
when you started having your babies.

607
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:03,340
I was just a dumb kid living in a dream.

608
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:07,886
All I ever wanted was a white house
with a walk-in closet.

609
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,223
Ain't that stupid?

610
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:15,561
No. Having a dream's never stupid.

611
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,107
Take it one day at a time,
that's what I say.

612
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,118
Come on, Ricky,
you always laugh at my air guitar.

613
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,871
Who's the best guitarist
in the whole world? Who?

614
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,165
Come on, Ricky, say it.

615
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,042
Yell it.

616
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,878
I know.

617
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,464
Look, Ricky, an Eskimo pissing.

618
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,101
Ricky, look at you.

619
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,690
I shouldn't have made you stay
in those woods. It's my fault.

620
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,069
But things are gonna be all right,
Ricky, I swear.

621
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,862
I've got us a lawyer...

622
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,908
and even though she is a woman,
she's pretty darn good.

623
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,036
She only costs a dollar too.

624
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,955
That's not it though.

625
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,375
I'm really sorry.

626
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,461
I'm gonna make it up to you.

627
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,046
I promise.

628
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,882
Hey.

629
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:30,552
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hi, Slick Moeller, Memphis Press.

630
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,138
I wrote the story this morning.
How's your brother?

631
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,516
- Get out of here! Get out!
- How's your brother?

632
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,352
Just a second, son,
I just wanna ask you a few questions.

633
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,231
- Did Clifford touch you any place?
- Get out! Just shut up!

634
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,192
Did he tell you why
he was committing suicide?

635
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,069
- Did he?
- You better get out of here.

636
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,113
- Did he talk to you at all?
- Get out!

637
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,824
I'll tell you what, I'll pay you.
Exclusive interview.

638
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,617
- Outside.
- Cops say you know more.

639
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,327
Mark, are you all right?

640
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,427
You understand I can't do it by day?

641
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,810
You Nance, private investigator?

642
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,522
Security specialist. Who's asking?

643
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,656
Name's Gronke. I need some fast work.

644
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:33,991
Who referred you?

645
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,285
Sulari, New Orleans.

646
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,003
I get $2000 cash retainer, non-refundable,
before I lift a finger.

647
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,220
You like kids?

648
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,019
First thing we'll do is...

649
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,687
is scheduled to be finished...

650
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:06,315
Why do you think Foltrigg was so...?

651
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,026
Mark, we're almost through.
Could you listen up?

652
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,445
Thank you.

653
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,656
Why do you think Foltrigg was
so convinced you were in Clifford's car?

654
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,116
I don't know.

655
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,328
If I'm gonna be your attorney,
you have to trust me.

656
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,665
I do trust you, Reggie.
I swear, I wasn't in that car.

657
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,881
You like Led Zeppelin?

658
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,885
Yeah. Do you like Led Zeppelin?

659
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh, yeah. They were a great band.

660
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,306
I'll bet you never even heard
of Led Zeppelin.

661
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,936
You're probably one of them grown-ups
who just say they like really cool bands...

662
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,147
just to get close to
little punks like me.

663
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,193
Well, I think we've covered
just about everything.

664
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,822
All right,
what's your favorite Zeppelin song?

665
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,619
"Moby Dick," live version.
Bitching drum solo.

666
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,497
I'll pick you up tomorrow
about 2:30, okay?

667
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,459
What were the names
of their first four albums, Miss Groupie?

668
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,671
You tell Reverend Roy
what you told me...

669
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,757
and that'll probably be the last
we'll hear from him, okay?

670
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,804
What happens if you lie to the FBI?

671
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,558
It's a federal offense.
In theory, you could go to jail. Why?

672
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:27,729
You weren't smoking something besides
cigarettes in that woods, were you?

673
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,441
- No, ma'am.
- Is there something you're not telling me?

674
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,611
I'm positive
I'm not keeping something from you.

675
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,655
I mean, I was just curious.

676
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,198
Okay.

677
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,245
Oh, the first Led Zeppelin albums
were called I, II and III.

678
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:48,750
The fourth, which is actually untitled,
is generally referred to as IV.

679
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,087
See you tomorrow, groupie.

680
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,093
Andy, it's the space people.
They've come back, I knew they would.

681
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,554
Hello, out there?

682
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,432
Just be peaceful.

683
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,893
We're... We're friendly, don't be afraid.

684
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:12,232
My assistant will now approach you,
do not hurt him.

685
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,234
Want one?

686
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,528
Elvis Pezley.

687
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,242
Elvis Pezley.

688
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,578
Bet it's poisoned.

689
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,709
- She's funny, isn't she?
- Yeah.

690
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,462
My boy loves her.

691
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,262
Sorry. My boy was in a car wreck.

692
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:43,972
Drunk driver.

693
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,724
Don't know if he's gonna make it.

694
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,227
- He's only 8.
- My brother's only 8.

695
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,188
He's really sick.

696
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,192
- What's wrong with him?
- He saw something, is all.

697
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,490
You're not the kids
who saw that suicide guy, are you?

698
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,242
I seen it on TV.

699
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,204
Jesus. That must have been awful.

700
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,583
- How's your brother doing?
- He just lays there.

701
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,544
Man, oh, man.
What a scary thing for a kid to see.

702
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,004
I wasn't scared.

703
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:20,467
Jesus, he must have been out of his mind
to stick a gun in his mouth like that.

704
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,969
I mean, why?

705
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,849
Was he acting weird
or yelling crazy stuff, or...?

706
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,231
Maybe he said something scary
to your little brother. That could be.

707
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,859
Well, dude, I gotta go.

708
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,448
- Well, I hope your brother gets better.
- Yeah.

709
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,742
Karen?

710
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,829
- Where's Karen?
- Off duty, hon. Get you anything?

711
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,956
You got anything to eat around here?

712
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,251
- Cafeteria's open 24 hours.
- All right.

713
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,845
Hey, kid, can I have your autograph?

714
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,622
They said they were all on vacation.

715
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,249
Lots of attitude, you know?

716
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,793
But I want them on, you see.

717
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,256
Everything's gonna be fine.

718
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,174
Just fine.

719
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,351
Now, you listen to me, Mark Sway.

720
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,106
I don't know what Romey told you,
but you repeat a single word to anyone...

721
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,441
including your bitch lawyer,
I'll kill you.

722
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,111
You talk to the feds tomorrow,
I'll kill you.

723
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,698
And if you tell anyone about me,
I'll kill you slow.

724
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,158
You understand me, little big boy?
You understand?

725
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:38,248
Good. We have an understanding.
Now, I'm gonna be watching you, boy.

726
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,678
So everybody in New Orleans knew...

727
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,763
that Muldano and Boyette
were in bed together.

728
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,599
Boyette got himself killed.

729
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,101
He took money from the Mafia
to build a toxic-waste dump...

730
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,146
then when his constituents got pissed,
he voted against it.

731
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,149
- Enter Barry "The Blade."
- Right, if Foltrigg can prove it.

732
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,944
Why would Foltrigg risk bringing in
Muldano if he didn't have Boyette's body?

733
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,989
I think this guy's gonna run for office.
What are we serving?

734
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,700
- It's Thursday.
- Southern pecan.

735
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:21,207
- Something wrong? Your brother all right?
- I ain't talking to the FBI and that's final.

736
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:25,712
Mark, you have to talk with the FBI.
If you don't, they could subpoena you.

737
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,673
Foltrigg is gonna be here any minute.

738
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:32,927
I said, no. Now, you're my lawyer
and you have to do what I tell you.

739
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,680
Reverend Roy, I saw you on TV.

740
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,974
- Oh, he's so handsome.
- This place is a dump.

741
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:41,645
- Yeah, you can say that again.
- My Lord.

742
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,190
- Are you...?
- They are coming down the hall.

743
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:48,234
Make them go away. Please.

744
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,321
All right, stay here. Stay out of sight.

745
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,867
Something's up. I don't get it,
but I will do it. Just sit down.

746
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:03,958
Good afternoon, Ms. Love.
Is young master Sway all ready?

747
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,712
Roy, I'm sorry,
but the meeting's been canceled.

748
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:10,924
I beg your pardon?

749
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,594
Why don't you let me debrief the child
and give you a statement in writing?

750
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:18,682
- You and I know he doesn't know anything.
- We need to talk to this child, Reggie.

751
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:22,811
We have a set of confirmed fingerprints
that put him inside Jerome Clifford's car.

752
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,021
Now, what you and I gonna do about that?

753
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:28,733
- Well, I think that the big question is...
- Shit.

754
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,152
How did you match his fingerprints?

755
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,405
We lifted one off a soda can
at the hospital.

756
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,658
And did you ask either Mark Sway
or his mother before doing so?

757
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,327
So you invaded the privacy
of an 11-year-old child?

758
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,330
- We were just trying to obtain evidence.
- Evidence for what?

759
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,249
So his prints are inside the car.

760
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,502
You have absolutely no proof
that he even interacted with Clifford.

761
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,963
Kid has a bruise on his left cheekbone.

762
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,799
We found a spot of blood on
Clifford's ring, not his type.

763
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,427
Well, let me guess.
Mark Sway's blood type?

764
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:56,845
That's right.

765
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,306
And how did you obtain
Mark Sway's blood type?

766
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,892
From his brother's
hospital admission records.

767
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,520
And how did you obtain
confidential hospital records?

768
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,355
- Look here now...
- No, you look here.

769
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,150
If you get near my client again
without my permission...

770
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,445
I'm gonna sue you and the FBI
for civil rights violations...

771
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:17,949
file an ethics complaint with the state
bar and I'm gonna haul your ass into court.

772
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,871
You're playing big league hardball here.
We don't respond to threats.

773
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,749
Does Mark Sway's mother know
you been institutionalized...

774
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,459
for drug and alcohol abuse?

775
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:39,429
It was a treatment center.
You just close the door when you leave.

776
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,805
Reggie?

777
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:45,560
Listen, you been practicing law for 2 years,
you're not equipped to handle this case.

778
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,064
We know more about your client's actions
than you do. You're an amateur, Reggie.

779
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,902
Your client's in serious peril.
You think that over.

780
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,405
Open that door, let me talk to him.

781
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,660
You are so good.

782
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,749
But I'm not gonna let you use this child
to climb into the governor's chair.

783
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,126
You think you look good on TV?

784
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,630
If you or your guys attempt
to contact my client or his family again...

785
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,466
I'm gonna put little Mark Sway
on the news prime time.

786
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,553
He can tell everybody how you trampled the
constitutional rights of an 11-year-old.

787
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,889
And I got the tape to prove it.

788
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,643
We'll talk to that boy.

789
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:31,606
You miss one step, I'll eat you alive.

790
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,575
Jesus Christ.

791
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,036
I'm gonna kill that kid.

792
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,541
You been lying to me. You got till three
to start telling the truth. One, two...

793
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,918
You're the liar!
Keep the dollar, you're fired!

794
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,838
What are you talking...?
You come back here. Come back here.

795
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,006
Mark. Shit, where are my car keys?

796
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,259
- Where did I put my car keys?
- In your purse.

797
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,559
Mark.

798
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:11,604
- Mark, get in the car. Come on.
- No.

799
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,481
- Mark, please.
- No.

800
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,192
Mark. Mark.

801
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:20,989
- Mark.
- Mark, a couple quick questions.

802
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,867
How'd you like the story this morning?

803
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,952
Move on.

804
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,165
One question!

805
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,630
That kid didn't hire a
lawyer for his health.

806
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,173
He knows where that body is.

807
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,302
Even the Mob knows he knows,
that's why they flew in Gronke.

808
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,678
You got it, Wally?

809
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,806
We gotta get our hands on that child
before the Mob does.

810
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:50,935
Here. We can petition the juvenile court
alleging the boy's in need of supervision.

811
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,563
And protection.
Gronke's not here to visit Graceland.

812
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:58,026
We explain to the judge it's in the kid's best
interest to take him into protective custody.

813
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,861
To get the judge to make him talk...

814
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,406
- We allege the kid's breaking the law.
- He is. He's obstructing justice.

815
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,577
You file those petitions.
Incarcerate his young ass tonight.

816
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,096
Where are we? You said we was just
getting rid of the reporters.

817
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,849
You see any reporters around?
This is my mama's house.

818
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,019
- You live with your mother?
- This is Momma Love.

819
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,355
Hi there. You must be Mark.

820
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,273
Take me back to the hospital.

821
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,485
Listen, you and I are gonna do
some talking first.

822
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,280
- Talk my ass, you're fired!
- Fine.

823
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,949
You're the boss.

824
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,996
This is kidnapping or something!
Take me back right now!

825
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,248
I'll hitchhike if I have to!

826
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,584
Go ahead.

827
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,548
Nice meeting you, Mark.

828
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,348
- Who is it?
- Your mother.

829
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,142
Hey, Bono.

830
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,895
How you doing, Paulie?

831
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,774
Guess Johnny means business,
bringing you here.

832
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,235
- Where's the kid?
- With that bitch lawyer.

833
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,529
Got a private dick tailing him.

834
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,239
Any sign of the fibbies?

835
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,409
Yeah, a couple, watching the hospital,
same as we are.

836
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,078
I gave that kid a little
warning last night.

837
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,372
This is the directive:

838
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:39,002
We bug everything, hospital room,
lawyer's office, the works.

839
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:41,421
Find out what the kid knows.

840
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,258
That doesn't work, we kill them all.

841
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,011
How's he doing?

842
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,971
Oh, when he gets hungry, he'll come in.

843
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:53,016
It's a lucky thing a car
only comes by here every four hours.

844
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,268
That is one willful child, Regina.

845
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,146
Pain in the butt, if you ask me.

846
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:02,191
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

847
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,121
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

848
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,082
How you doing? You remember me?
You're the kid at the hospital, right?

849
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,419
Well, hop in. I'll give you a ride.

850
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,004
Come on now.

851
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,299
What are you doing out here anyway?
Come on, hop in.

852
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,969
Hey, you know,
my boy's getting much better.

853
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,388
How's your brother doing?

854
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,557
Come on back here.

855
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:38,770
- Elvis has left the building.
- Told you so.

856
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,610
- Why, hello there.
- Take me back to the hospital.

857
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,404
- Want some lemonade?
- I'm not taking you anywhere...

858
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,115
- ...until we've had a conversation.
- Or a piece of pie?

859
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,493
Where's a phone? I need to call a cab.

860
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,287
Help yourself.
It's 40 dollars from here, Momma?

861
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,248
Or 45? I'm not sure, something with a tip.

862
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,002
Look, you're fired, okay?
Can't you get that through your thick head?

863
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:06,839
Fine. Because I cannot do my job
if you keep hiding things from me.

864
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:11,427
Did it ever occur to you how it made me
feel to take on Foltrigg on your behalf...

865
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,012
without the facts?

866
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,640
I should've smelled your breath
before I hired you...

867
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,560
- ...then I would've known you was a drunk.
- Well, I think I'll be going.

868
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,021
I have been sober for 3 years.

869
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:26,192
Yeah, right. That's what all the drunks say.
How they gonna get sober and all.

870
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,653
They even say they love you,
but they don't.

871
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:32,031
Then they come home wasted
and beat on you and your mother so bad...

872
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,742
you gotta hit them in the face
with a baseball bat.

873
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,453
You're talking about your daddy,
aren't you?

874
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,914
Yeah, well I got rid of him.

875
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,750
When me and my mom went into court
to buy a divorce...

876
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,585
our lawyer sucked, as usual.

877
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,840
So I went up there and told the judge
myself about all the beatings...

878
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,176
and about how
he made us sleep in the street.

879
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,429
And that's when my father
became my ex-father.

880
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:59,559
And now I got you,
and you're a drunk and a bad lawyer too.

881
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,103
So now I'm getting rid of you.
You're fired, okay?

882
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,022
I can handle this myself.

883
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:08,693
Mark.

884
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,321
Mark, I used to think
I could handle everything by myself.

885
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,575
But sometimes being strong
means asking for help.

886
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,536
I know you've been taking
real good care of your family...

887
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,205
but the FBI's
not gonna leave you alone.

888
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,668
- You gotta let me help you.
- Let go.

889
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:29,005
- I need a cigarette.
- Smoking is terrible for you.

890
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,465
Hey, hey, hey.

891
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,467
What did Romey tell you in that car?

892
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,845
God, why do I always
have to answer questions?

893
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,848
Why don't you ever have to
answer any questions?

894
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,434
Okay, that's fair.
Go ahead, ask me something.

895
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,768
Like what?

896
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,856
Whatever you want. Go ahead,
there's no rules, there's no limits.

897
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,317
You ask me and I will answer.

898
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,776
And you'll tell the truth?

899
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,404
If it takes my skin off.

900
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:55,448
All right.

901
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,993
What's that thing you always wear
around your neck?

902
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,954
This is my mamaw's compass.

903
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,749
I wear it so I'll never lose my way again.

904
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,920
Anything else?

905
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,380
Yeah. These your kids?

906
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,508
- Yes.
- They chained down in the basement?

907
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,510
Close. They're with their daddy.

908
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,721
- There was a divorce.
- You ever see them?

909
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,851
- They don't really wanna see me.
- Because you was drunk and on drugs.

910
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:27,563
Because after the divorce
I drank some, yes.

911
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,568
I drank a lot.

912
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,614
Why?

913
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:42,286
You're right, there must be a cigarette
around here someplace.

914
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:47,583
I married a big Memphis doctor, worked my ass
off to put him through medical school...

915
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:51,921
and soon as he became rich and famous,
he traded me in for a younger model.

916
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,389
I didn't have a dollar
to put food in the fridge...

917
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,267
or a car to go look for a job.

918
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:08,062
But I figured I could handle it myself,
just like you.

919
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,649
But I was wrong.

920
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,277
So then you started to drink?

921
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,823
First, I stopped sleeping and eating.

922
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:22,702
I was scared to death. I kept staying up
every night, watching my babies...

923
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,996
trying to figure out
what I was gonna do.

924
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,832
Finally, I took some pills to sleep.

925
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,712
Hell, he prescribed them for me.
I was not trying to kill myself.

926
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,424
But that's when he pounced.

927
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,968
Got himself a fancy lawyer.

928
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,803
I didn't have anybody.

929
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:44,724
I figured after all those years
of blowing noses and wiping butts...

930
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,184
fixing meals and carpooling
the kids every which way...

931
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,603
that it'd count for something.

932
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,398
I was a fool.

933
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,277
The court declared me unfit.

934
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,324
Just like that, they were gone.

935
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,743
He took...

936
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,537
my little girl and my little boy.

937
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:09,874
Anyhow, that's when I started drinking.

938
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,668
But I got myself sober...

939
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,128
I stayed sober...

940
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,173
and I put myself through law school.

941
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:22,219
Do you miss your kids?

942
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:27,516
So much
I try not to even think about them.

943
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,252
He told me.

944
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,172
Romey told me where the body's buried.

945
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,842
Do you wanna tell me?

946
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,553
I can call the police
and put an end to this right now.

947
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:07,473
But I swore an oath
that I wouldn't tell nobody.

948
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:11,644
They're gonna get me, Reggie.
I seen it on TV.

949
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,771
The Mob never forgets.

950
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,315
Oh, my God.
They came after you, didn't they?

951
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,361
- Yes, ma'am.
- I gotta get security on your brother's room.

952
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,738
And notify the police
and get you out of here...

953
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,324
back to the hospital
where you'll be safe.

954
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,410
Reggie...

955
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,537
I'm scared.

956
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,514
What's up?

957
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,894
He's in there. But y'all gonna have
to deal with the two bitches.

958
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:56,313
What do you think?

959
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,109
I got an idea.

960
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,156
It's gonna take at least a week
to get that kid into protective custody.

961
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,324
We still gotta find a way
to make him talk.

962
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,077
I want that kid in court
and on the stand mañana.

963
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,329
- You hear what I'm telling you?
- Yes, but...

964
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,707
Let me have the phone.
I know how to solve this.

965
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,544
Don't you have something to do?
Why don't you go wake somebody up?

966
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,798
- Mr. Foltrigg? May I have your autograph?
- Of course you can.

967
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,177
Thomas, let me encourage you
to produce me some immediate results...

968
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:30,681
in the interest of your own personal
job security right, by God, now.

969
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:31,932
What's your name?

970
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,801
Our trailer...

971
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:12,389
They burned down our home.
We got nothing left.

972
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,099
Who did?

973
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:15,726
How the hell do I know?

974
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:20,314
Somebody, they saw two people,
they was leaving and...

975
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:22,775
It's all gone. All of it.

976
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,569
- Mom, it's my fault.
- Dianne, I'm so sorry.

977
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,657
Look, it's gonna be all right.
Do you know if you have insurance?

978
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,368
That is none of your business, really.

979
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,620
I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.

980
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:37,998
- I was just trying to help, is all.
- What is this crap?

981
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:42,169
A few things I put together
to make you feel more comfortable...

982
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:45,256
- I don't need your charity.
- It's not charity...

983
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,592
And I don't need you trying
to come in here and take away my son.

984
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:53,222
- Mark's already got a mother!
- I know that. You're doing a fine job.

985
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,516
- I don't need your help.
- Look, I'm sorry...

986
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,892
Get out!

987
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,191
Sure.

988
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,363
Reggie.

989
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:12,074
- Reggie, you okay?
- I'm fine.

990
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,660
They got her on all kinds of medication.

991
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,037
She doesn't know what she's saying.

992
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,209
I had no call
to speak to her that way, Lord.

993
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,503
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

994
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,841
Hello.

995
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,093
I'm Detective Ed Nassar, Memphis P.D.

996
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,886
- You Dianne Sway?
- Yeah.

997
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,557
These are from juvenile court. It's a
summons for a hearing at 10 tomorrow.

998
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,019
The summons requires us to take
young Mark into custody at this time.

999
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,396
What? You can't take my son.

1000
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,773
- Well, we're gonna have to.
- You son of a bitch.

1001
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,775
- Easy now.
- Over my dead body.

1002
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:50,529
- It's for his own good.
- What's he done? Just tell me.

1003
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,156
Can somebody help me?
Don't touch him.

1004
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:54,742
The petition was filed
because he will not cooperate...

1005
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,951
Son of a bitch!

1006
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,411
- Come on. Come on.
- Help.

1007
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,625
- Come on. Calm down. Calm down.
- Help me.

1008
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,252
- Mark.
- Come on.

1009
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,172
There's no reason to get excited.
We'll take good care of him.

1010
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,258
- Give it up. Come on.
- Get off of me!

1011
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,219
Come on, now,
you're getting yourself all riled up.

1012
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,347
Agh!

1013
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,060
They're taking me to jail!
I'm an 11-year-old!

1014
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,145
- They hit my mother!
- Shut up, Markus.

1015
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,314
Hey, you gonna read me my rights?

1016
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,025
Hey, meathead,
you even know how to read?

1017
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,235
- You gonna cuff me?
- This is not an arrest.

1018
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,821
- Then what the hell is it?
- Watch your mouth, kid.

1019
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,449
Kiss my ass, you stupid jerk.

1020
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,168
He's all yours.

1021
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,755
Calm down.

1022
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:53,050
Empty your pockets.

1023
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,018
Okay, now follow me.

1024
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,812
- There you are.
- I don't look bad.

1025
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,021
You look good.

1026
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,358
All right.

1027
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,236
- Hello?
- I twisted every arm, I broke every leg.

1028
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,446
You got what you want.
The kid's in custody.

1029
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:18,033
- You got your hearing tomorrow at 10a.m.
- I knew you could do it, Jason.

1030
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,952
Well done.

1031
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:22,162
- One child in jail.
- All right.

1032
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,964
- What kind of place is this?
- Women's detention hall.

1033
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,928
- Keep the noise down!
- Why am I being put in with the women?

1034
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:39,555
Because you're a minor.

1035
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,433
Stop treating me like a kid.
Put me where the men are.

1036
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:47,062
You're safer here.
You have this whole cell to yourself.

1037
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:50,232
- Is this what they mean by solitary?
- No.

1038
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:53,652
You can have any bed you want.
Don't give me any trouble.

1039
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,536
You okay, boy?

1040
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:04,955
Can I call my mom?

1041
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:08,500
Just to tell her where I'm at
and that I'm okay.

1042
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,171
Please, she's probably
worried sick about me.

1043
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,550
I suppose I could run a phone in here.

1044
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,428
I'll make this little exception,
just this once.

1045
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:21,472
Thank you, ma'am.

1046
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:28,228
Brother's Pizza.

1047
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,899
Yes, I would like to order
20 of your largest Supremes.

1048
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,276
Okay, and where's that going, honey?

1049
01:08:34,486 --> 01:08:37,446
I'm ordering for Detective Nassar,
North Precinct.

1050
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,324
Okay, and how would you like to pay
for this order?

1051
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,452
- Well, with my credit card.
- Number, please.

1052
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:49,082
The number is 4000-0306...

1053
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,961
1954-0010.

1054
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,464
Okay, hold on.

1055
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,592
That'll be $248.10.

1056
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:00,886
Fine. Cheaper than the last time.

1057
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,722
- Oh, well.
- Thank you.

1058
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,105
We'll never get him out tonight.
Foltrigg filed a custody petition.

1059
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,316
- Roosevelt scheduled a hearing for 10.
- Ten?

1060
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:17,569
There's three to seven days
after filing a petition, not hours.

1061
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,530
That damn Foltrigg, he'll do anything.

1062
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,324
- Got that right.
- A child behind bars for the night.

1063
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:27,162
I have been through this wallet three times,
I have found everything except my Visa.

1064
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,664
Man, these things are hot.

1065
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,792
Hi. Did y'all order the pizzas?

1066
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,119
My, my, my.

1067
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:13,333
You didn't have to sign a custody order.
I would've brought him here.

1068
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:16,628
- Good morning to you too, Reggie.
- What is going on?

1069
01:10:16,838 --> 01:10:18,881
According to the FBI...

1070
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:24,469
a Mr. Paul Gronke and his pal, Bono,
have just arrived in our fair city.

1071
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,763
- You ever heard of these guys?
- No.

1072
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:31,143
- Your client could be in a world of danger.
- Oh, shit.

1073
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:32,895
What does the child know?

1074
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:36,148
- You know that's privileged.
- So he knows more than he should?

1075
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:44,072
If he did know something, would you
guarantee him witness protection...

1076
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:47,284
complete relocation
for his mother, his brother and him?

1077
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:48,702
Well, this is not standard.

1078
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,789
Damn it, Harry.
Why should he talk if we can't protect him?

1079
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:57,502
Forgive my presumption here, Reggie,
but you do seem overly agitated.

1080
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,755
Whatever became of that...

1081
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:04,343
objectivity we used to fight about
over at Memphis State?

1082
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,178
After all...

1083
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:09,222
he is just a client, isn't he?

1084
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,393
I'm sorry, I just didn't get much sleep.

1085
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,147
It's just that...

1086
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:22,235
he's never had a break
and he's counting on me.

1087
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,751
Hey.

1088
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,508
- Thanks, Doreen.
- Good luck.

1089
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,472
- Brought your jacket.
- Thanks.

1090
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,517
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1091
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,812
You sure clean up good.

1092
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,480
You too.

1093
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,151
Why can't I just tell them
I don't know nothing, Reggie?

1094
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,321
Because it's wrong.
Because it's against the law.

1095
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:11,243
And besides, nobody's gonna believe you.
Not the Mob, not the FBI, nobody.

1096
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,912
And besides that,
Barry Muldano's a killer.

1097
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:17,582
You've got a chance to stop him
before he hurts somebody else.

1098
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:22,379
Didn't you tell the truth in divorce court,
about being a good mom and all?

1099
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,840
- Yes.
- Proof, the truth hurts.

1100
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:28,260
- They took your kids away.
- All right, you're right, you're right.

1101
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:31,638
But, Mark, don't you see,
if you lie, you're gonna be just like them.

1102
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,808
If I tell the truth, he'll kill me.

1103
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:36,560
All right.

1104
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,895
Look, have you ever...?

1105
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,648
Have you ever heard
of the witness-protection program?

1106
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:46,278
Lord, yes. That's where they put you
in those funny mustaches...

1107
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,406
and send you off to New Jersey
or someplace to live.

1108
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,116
I saw it on TV.

1109
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,327
But the guy in the TV movie,
the Mob found him anyways...

1110
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,329
and they blew his legs off.

1111
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,749
You saw that on TV?

1112
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,021
Reggie, no matter what I do,
I could probably get killed.

1113
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,983
- You can't let them ask me any questions.
- I'll try, Mark.

1114
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,569
But if Foltrigg gets you on that stand...

1115
01:13:27,779 --> 01:13:31,782
you can't lie or
you'll be just like them.

1116
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,368
- Okay?
- Court is in session.

1117
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,246
Mark.

1118
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:45,128
My, we certainly have drawn a crowd
this morning. Officer?

1119
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:47,672
I'm Sergeant Hardy.

1120
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,175
What are you doing in my court
wearing a firearm?

1121
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,551
Wait...

1122
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,179
Thank you. You may go.

1123
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,143
And you, Mr. Moeller.

1124
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,564
Your coverage of the case has led me
to consider having you indicted...

1125
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,608
for reckless endangerment.

1126
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,026
But, Your Honor...

1127
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:11,029
Another word
and I will slap you with contempt.

1128
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:13,240
Good day, sir.

1129
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,787
Well now, that's better.
Shall we proceed?

1130
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,999
Your honor, I'd like to note for the record
that the child's without custodial parent.

1131
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,127
Request postponement
until she can appear.

1132
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:28,755
I'm Thomas Fink, assistant U.S. attorney
for eastern Louisiana.

1133
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,551
I'd like to address this issue
of the absence of the child's mother.

1134
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,178
It's our position,
the position of the petitioners...

1135
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,764
Your position, Mr. Fink, is in that chair.

1136
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,432
Please sit.

1137
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,810
And listen carefully,
I'll only say this once.

1138
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,271
- Judge Roosevelt...
- As for you, Mr. Foltrigg...

1139
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,732
this is not New Orleans
and I'm not one of your federal judges.

1140
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:51,194
This is my private courtroom
and I make the rules.

1141
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:55,198
Rule number one:
You will speak only when spoken to.

1142
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:59,953
Rule number two: Do not grace His Honor
with unsolicited commentary.

1143
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:04,082
Rule number three: His Honor does not like
to listen to the voice of U.S. attorneys...

1144
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:08,503
who love to hear themselves speak.
Do you understand these rules, gentlemen?

1145
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:13,341
Mr. Foltrigg? You want Mr. Fink
to handle the case for the prosecution?

1146
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,468
Yes, sir. If it please the court, sir.

1147
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:18,763
I'll allow it, but try and keep his butt
in that seat, please.

1148
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,183
- Sir.
- Court will act in loco parentis.

1149
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:27,772
I'll watch out for the child's interests
in this hearing, Ms. Love. Proceed.

1150
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:31,318
The child moves to dismiss on grounds
the allegations are without merit.

1151
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,654
The petition has been filed
to explore things the child might know.

1152
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,824
- Quit calling me "the child."
- Quiet, young man.

1153
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:39,868
Proceed.

1154
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:44,915
Mr. Foltrigg and Mr. Fink are using
this hearing as a fishing expedition.

1155
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:48,627
Their supposition that the... My client...

1156
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:52,172
had any legally significant
conversation with Mr. Clifford...

1157
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,674
is based on purely
circumstantial evidence.

1158
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,344
The petition should be dismissed
and we should go home.

1159
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,304
- Your Honor, if I may?
- You may.

1160
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,599
The child is the last person
to see Jerome Clifford alive.

1161
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:05,852
Now, we have established
this child willfully deceived us.

1162
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,897
A set of fingerprints on a Cadillac
is hardly willful deceit.

1163
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:13,652
We can show the child's fingerprints
on the suicide hose and on the gun itself.

1164
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,614
We feel the child must testify for
his own good in order to exonerate himself.

1165
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:22,661
Mr. Fink, are you attempting to implicate
this child in Clifford's suicide?

1166
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:26,164
No, we are not. Currently, we are alleging
only obstruction of justice.

1167
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:30,043
Now, involvement in a suicide
could constitute juvenile delinquency.

1168
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,587
This child could be removed
from his mother's care.

1169
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,798
Your Honor, there's no basis for this.

1170
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,927
Your Honor, we are only asking that
the child testify to clear his good name.

1171
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,347
We're not forcing the child to testify.
Not yet.

1172
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,643
Ms. Love, will your client testify
and put an end to this foolishness?

1173
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,228
And if we refuse?

1174
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:53,775
Well, I don't like it, but I'd have to
lock him back up till we sort this out.

1175
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,027
No.

1176
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,991
Your Honor,
the child moves for a change of venue.

1177
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,952
Since the alleged murder of Boyette
occurred in Louisiana...

1178
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,746
we would like a relocation
to that locality.

1179
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:10,458
As the United States attorney
for eastern Louisiana, I waive venue...

1180
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:11,751
The child declines.

1181
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,337
And release the proceedings
to your jurisdiction.

1182
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:15,588
The child declines.

1183
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:17,090
That's a pretty suit.

1184
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,425
Drop dead, Roy.

1185
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,762
All right, you two. Just settle down.

1186
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:26,349
Nice try, but I think it would be
in everybody's best interests...

1187
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:27,976
for Mark to take the stand.

1188
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,312
- Your Honor...
- That's my ruling, counselor.

1189
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:37,110
Mark, I want you to come up here
and take this seat right by me.

1190
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,490
It's okay.

1191
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,293
Put up your right hand, Mark.

1192
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:56,296
You swear to tell the truth?

1193
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,547
You have to say it.

1194
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:00,008
I swear.

1195
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,802
Okay. Mr. Fink is gonna
ask you some questions.

1196
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,347
He'll keep them clear and simple,
understand?

1197
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,224
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Fink.

1198
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,685
- May I rise?
- Mr. Fink.

1199
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:13,396
How you doing, Mark?

1200
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:18,360
Mark, were you forced into the car
with Mr. Clifford before he died?

1201
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,865
Yes, sir.

1202
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:26,868
Did you and Mr. Clifford
have a conversation?

1203
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:34,250
- Yes, sir.
- Listen up.

1204
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,047
Did Mr. Clifford mention Barry Muldano
or Senator Boyd Boyette?

1205
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,388
You answer the question, Mark.

1206
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:52,268
Is taking the Fifth Amendment lying?

1207
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,645
No, it's not lying.

1208
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,441
- Well, can I take the Fifth Amendment?
- No, you cannot.

1209
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,693
Why not? It applies to kids, doesn't it?

1210
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,153
Not in this case, Mark.

1211
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,407
You're not implicated
in the death of Senator Boyette...

1212
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,534
so you'll have to answer the question.

1213
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,662
Your Honor, as Mr. Foltrigg has done
so thorough a job...

1214
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:15,333
in attempting to implicate Mark,
I must, out of an abundance of caution...

1215
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:17,710
advise my client to take the Fifth.

1216
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:23,007
Haven't we played enough games here?
We are all searchers for the truth.

1217
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:26,719
A man's been murdered and another man
lies dead by his own hand...

1218
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,932
yet this boy remains silent.
What wanton hubris is this?

1219
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:32,225
Speak, child, now.

1220
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:36,020
Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,
so sayeth the Psalm.

1221
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,731
That's Proverbs, 12:22.

1222
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:41,526
This is still a courtroom,
not a church, Mr. Foltrigg.

1223
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,027
Please, sit down.

1224
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:46,906
Did Romey Clifford tell you
where Boyd Boyette's body's at, son?

1225
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,950
Mr. Foltrigg.

1226
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,786
Yes, sir.

1227
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,999
Answer the question, Mark.

1228
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:04,424
I take the Fifth Amendment.

1229
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:08,136
I'm sorry, but I can't answer
any of these questions...

1230
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:12,390
because I'm afraid of what might happen
to me or my family.

1231
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:18,146
I have no choice but to return you
to protective custody.

1232
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:20,023
All right, this is over yet.

1233
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,567
Sorry, Mark, it's for your own protection.

1234
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:24,861
Why can't you get him
to answer the question?

1235
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,655
These proceedings are closed.

1236
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:34,078
- I didn't lie, Reggie.
- You did great.

1237
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,582
What kind of a lawyer tells a child
to plead the Fifth...

1238
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:40,627
send him back to jail
and hold up a federal investigation?

1239
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:44,631
You trying to ruin this boy's life
or just flat-out get him killed?

1240
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:52,096
You did real good, Reggie.

1241
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:13,076
- We alone?
- Yeah, we're alone.

1242
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,661
What happened?

1243
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,830
- I was looking for a little more this time.
- What?

1244
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,333
I asked you a question.

1245
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,545
Kid's going back to jail.
Roosevelt just wants to keep him safe.

1246
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:26,923
- What's he know?
- I'd say he knows everything.

1247
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,968
The bastard. Harry wants him
back in court tomorrow at noon...

1248
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:32,887
to see if a night in the slammer
changes his mind.

1249
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:35,098
- You didn't hear this from me.
- Shut up.

1250
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,892
Come on, man,
give me a little break here, would you?

1251
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,909
Get out of my way.

1252
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,288
Go powder your nose.

1253
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,583
What is it? I'm eating here.

1254
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,210
I just talked to Gronke in Memphis.

1255
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,920
What can I get you?

1256
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,922
Dos Equis.

1257
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:12,385
- Where's your regular waiter?
- I don't know.

1258
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:15,430
Cops got the kid.
I still can't move the stiff.

1259
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,016
You're a dumb-ass, you know that?

1260
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,976
We've had this conversation.

1261
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,396
I'm sick of it. I deserve respect.

1262
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:24,897
- Nice work, Ron.
- Thanks.

1263
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,609
- Just once, Uncle Johnny...
- Picking it up just fine.

1264
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,028
We still need to make the move.

1265
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:31,904
That little bastard knows something.

1266
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,325
Probably told his lawyer.
We're tapping the phones.

1267
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,036
I hate goddamn lawyers.

1268
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:40,038
Please, just let me hit the kid.

1269
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:42,415
We got nothing to worry about
from that kid.

1270
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,627
- Let's call the whole thing quits.
- That kid knows...

1271
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:48,880
Goddamn bugs.

1272
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,259
The city's lousy with them.

1273
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:56,262
You're probably right, Uncle Johnny.

1274
01:22:56,764 --> 01:22:57,805
Kid knows nothing.

1275
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,853
They're onto us.

1276
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:06,314
We're out of business.

1277
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,819
So we're just gonna put this whole thing
behind us. Is that clear?

1278
01:23:13,072 --> 01:23:14,614
I got it, Uncle Johnny.

1279
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:45,937
- Regina, what are you doing?
- Nothing, Momma, you go back to bed.

1280
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,441
Have you any idea what time it is?

1281
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,528
Momma, have you seen
my notebooks from school?

1282
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,279
In the garage, maybe.

1283
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:59,659
- Garage? Oh, shit, yeah.
- Baby, you need to get some sleep.

1284
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,953
He's your client, Regina,
he's not your child.

1285
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:22,432
Damn.

1286
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,111
Jesus.

1287
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,076
Mark. Mark.

1288
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,580
Telda, call the medic! Quick!

1289
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,916
Medic on 5 now!

1290
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:33,628
Goddamn, the boy's soaking wet.

1291
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:36,005
- The baby's in shock, isn't he?
- Go get a towel.

1292
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:37,548
Shit.

1293
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:40,301
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1294
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:44,013
This kid's heart is about to explode.
Get an ambulance, now.

1295
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:46,015
Right. Telda, call an ambulance!

1296
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,857
- What do we got?
- Elevated pulse and BP.

1297
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:57,860
He's come down a bit since we got him.
Kid's from juvenile court.

1298
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,862
- Is he a bleeder or anything?
- No.

1299
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,240
He can wait five minutes.
Wheel him over there.

1300
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:04,867
- Sign on the line, he's yours.
- Where are the police?

1301
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,744
He's just a juvenile.

1302
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:09,121
Goddamn it! Look at this, man.

1303
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,961
My guitar. I just can't believe it,
man. Look at my guitar.

1304
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,589
- Forget the guitar.
- No, honey, this is an original guitar.

1305
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:21,884
- Settle down, settle down.
- Just what we need, drunk Elvis.

1306
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,846
There's people over here who
need help. I need a new guitar.

1307
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,973
Who's gonna pay for this? Who's paying?

1308
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,444
- Got a light?
- Sure.

1309
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:41,737
Is there coffee?

1310
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,740
I think they got a fresh pot.
Too hot in there for you?

1311
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:09,116
Mark?

1312
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:13,079
Paging Mr. Sway.

1313
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:18,417
Now, it's nothing personal, kid.
I don't wanna hurt you.

1314
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,586
I just wanna talk.

1315
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,297
Want a smoke?

1316
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,175
Let's have a smoke together.

1317
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:27,927
Mark?

1318
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,993
Okay, you little punk, game's over.

1319
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:56,622
Isn't this a nice spot to die?

1320
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:59,917
Well, well, I wonder if we're gonna find
a live body in here.

1321
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:03,421
Come on over here.

1322
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:05,965
Boy!

1323
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,843
Open this door, you little punk!

1324
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:19,520
- McThune.
- Chief, it's Jerry.

1325
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:22,648
It's about Mark Sway. He's escaped.

1326
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,316
Pardon me?

1327
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,320
Hi there, thought you boys
could use some coffee.

1328
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,156
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Mrs. Love.

1329
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,407
Oh, you're welcome.

1330
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:37,329
Is this really the best time
to defrost the freezer?

1331
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,914
Will you shut up?

1332
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,044
- You need anything else, you just holler.
- What are you being so nice to them for?

1333
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:46,422
Because they're cute.
They're just trying to be protective.

1334
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,632
Where have you been? They are here...

1335
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:52,928
because they are hoping an 11-year-old
boy comes by so they can pounce on him.

1336
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,014
I feel like a prisoner.

1337
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,807
Shit.

1338
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,392
Will you just be calm?

1339
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:01,896
Me? You're the one who hasn't be able
to sit still since they got here.

1340
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,231
It isn't everyday
cops stake out your house.

1341
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,567
All right, fine. Let's just all relax.

1342
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:09,653
Can we do that?
Let's just try to sit down and relax.

1343
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,864
I'm relaxed.

1344
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:18,120
- Hello.
- Reggie, it's me.

1345
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,623
I've busted out of jail.
You've gotta come get me.

1346
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:24,376
Jeannette. It's Jeannette.

1347
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:29,340
It's Jeannette.

1348
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:32,343
What are you doing calling me so late?

1349
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,386
Who's Jeannette?

1350
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:37,056
I'm at St. Peter's, hiding out.

1351
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:39,391
- What?
- I ran in place for an hour...

1352
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:43,187
and I faked an attack
of post-traumatic stress disorder.

1353
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,774
They rushed me right over.
It was easy as pie.

1354
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:49,068
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

1355
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:52,154
I locked a Mafia guy in the morgue
who was trying to kill me.

1356
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,116
- You go down the hall.
- I hear something down the hallway.

1357
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:57,660
Mark, go find yourself a policeman
right now.

1358
01:30:57,911 --> 01:30:59,787
Found someone locked up
in a cooler.

1359
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,330
You kidding me?

1360
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,082
I'm not going back to jail.

1361
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:07,253
Reggie, if you don't come and get me,
I'm gonna go where I'm going on my own.

1362
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,631
- No, no, no.
- I'm serious. You've gotta come get me.

1363
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:15,344
Now, you're the only friend I've got,
and you know that. Don't let me down.

1364
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:16,720
Shit.

1365
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:23,102
I'll meet you by the front
parking lot in a dark gray Honda.

1366
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:27,439
Okay. Right in front of the cross.
The big one.

1367
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:30,276
Thank you, Reggie. Thanks.

1368
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,987
- My dark gray Honda?
- Just give me the keys.

1369
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:36,365
You can't run away with an escaped
whatever the hell he is.

1370
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:40,286
They'll arrest you for contributing.
You'll be disbarred. You've lost your mind.

1371
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,831
Momma, I need you to distract the police.
I'm gonna go out the back.

1372
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:47,459
Go get them a coffee or something,
and don't ask me any questions, please.

1373
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:50,713
- Oh, I need some cash.
- Come on, Reg, this is my rent money.

1374
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:54,258
I know, but you can live with Momma.
She likes you better than me anyway.

1375
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,926
Well, that wouldn't be hard.

1376
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,558
Nobody gets in.

1377
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,288
Get in.

1378
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,416
Stay down.
Your mama must be beside herself.

1379
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:30,586
I called her from the morgue
and told her we'd fix everything.

1380
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:33,547
- We?
- You're an accomplice now, aren't you?

1381
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,092
Shit.

1382
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,559
We're watching the mother's room
in case he tries to get to her.

1383
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:47,394
We put a bug in her phone.

1384
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,021
Anybody talk to her?

1385
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,315
- You said you wanted to be the first.
- I do.

1386
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:55,319
- You know your boy's missing.
- Missing? You mean you lost him.

1387
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:58,239
Has he tried to contact you tonight?

1388
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:02,701
You searched the hospital?
He knows it real well, you know.

1389
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,703
Yes, we have searched the hospital.

1390
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,873
Reggie Love is missing too.
Do you think Mark could be with her?

1391
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,251
Hell, y'all are the FBI.

1392
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,587
Since you got involved,
our trailer's been blown up...

1393
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:16,632
my boy's been thrown in jail,
and now he's missing.

1394
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,928
So let me tell you something.
Act like the FBI. You find him.

1395
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,476
- Head towards the bridge.
- Why?

1396
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,728
Well, I been thinking.

1397
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:32,231
That witness-protection thing
sounds pretty good.

1398
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,693
But Romey was all drunk and on pills.

1399
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,071
What if the body ain't where he said,
would we still get protection?

1400
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:41,907
We make our deal
before we tell them where the body is...

1401
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:44,159
and then just keep our fingers crossed.

1402
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:47,663
So first we gotta be sure
the body's even there, right?

1403
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,123
What are you getting at?

1404
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,333
We gotta go to New Orleans...

1405
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:54,545
and try and find Boyette's body's
where Romey said it is.

1406
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:59,758
You are out of your mind.
No way. Absolutely not. That's it.

1407
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:03,512
Where are you going? You... Wait... Stay.
Damn it.

1408
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:10,144
Get back in the car. Mark.
Where are you going? Mark.

1409
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:13,397
- Someone's gonna see you.
- Let me go, I'll hitchhike if I have to.

1410
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,774
You are crazy.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

1411
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,402
A lot of other people could get killed
if I don't go.

1412
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,529
- Mark.
- I'll do it on my own if I have to.

1413
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,240
Mark, please. Please.

1414
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:32,666
Remember at Momma Love's...

1415
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:36,670
what you told me about,
well, asking people for help?

1416
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:40,883
- Yeah.
- I guess now I'm asking you.

1417
01:34:44,637 --> 01:34:46,221
Please?

1418
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:55,356
Hey, where are you going?

1419
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,566
I'm gonna look for a map to New Orleans.

1420
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:00,069
What do you think I'm doing?

1421
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:05,491
The kid broke jail. The lawyer's missing.

1422
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,369
Gronke spent all night in a freezer.

1423
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:12,915
No one has been killed
and the body has not been moved.

1424
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,918
Can you explain this to me,
Barry "The Blade"?

1425
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,003
Well, the thing is, Uncle Johnny...

1426
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,923
I hid the body under a boat
in Romey's boathouse.

1427
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,174
You what?

1428
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:26,470
I wanted Romey to remember how close he
was to being dead. It was kind of a joke.

1429
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:27,721
Very funny.

1430
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,349
After Romey died,
there were cops all over the place.

1431
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,810
But now they're finally gone,
I can get the body.

1432
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:36,355
The way this has been handled,
Barry, has been very stupid.

1433
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:41,652
I will not let you take this family
down with you, do you understand?

1434
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,406
I'm begging you, Uncle Johnny,
just let me get the body.

1435
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:49,243
Help me now and I promise,
I'll never make another mistake again.

1436
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:56,792
Take Gronke and Bono.

1437
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:00,587
I'm giving you one chance
to clear this up.

1438
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:02,923
This is my last favor, Barry.

1439
01:36:03,133 --> 01:36:05,509
Thank you, Uncle Johnny.

1440
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,053
Barry.

1441
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,849
Do you understand what I mean
when I say "my last favor"?

1442
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,184
I understand.

1443
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:23,527
Reggie Love's office.

1444
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,864
Listen, carefully, call Dianne
Sway, tell her Mark's okay. He's with me.

1445
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:28,907
Where are you?
The feds are going crazy.

1446
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:32,161
A motel outside New Orleans.
I gotta go, we'll be back tomorrow.

1447
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,412
You gotta tell me...

1448
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,582
Clint, if anything happens,
take care of Momma Love for me, okay?

1449
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,877
Reggie,
Reggie, don't you hang up. Reggie.

1450
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,649
Got something.

1451
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:04,401
Good. Good work.

1452
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:08,906
Hot damn. We monitored a call from Clint
Von Hooser to Dianne Sway at the hospital.

1453
01:37:09,115 --> 01:37:10,949
Love has got the kid in New Orleans.

1454
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,535
- We're out of here.
- Get the airplane.

1455
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,913
- Excellent news.
- Yes, sir.

1456
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,456
We are out of here?

1457
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,751
We'll give you a telephone call.
Move out, Walter.

1458
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,878
Wally.

1459
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,093
Are we still going north?

1460
01:37:30,303 --> 01:37:32,679
I don't know. Check my compass.

1461
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:36,225
- Take it off.
- No, I never take it off.

1462
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:38,685
That's okay, we're on the right street.

1463
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:40,687
1210.

1464
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:42,648
Turn your lights off.

1465
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:45,817
This is where the rich people live.
Holy shit, look at that one.

1466
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,778
Don't curse.

1467
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:51,490
- Shine it over there, see what that one is.
- 1212.

1468
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,951
1213.

1469
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,036
This must be 1214.

1470
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:58,038
- There it is. Bingo.
- Bingo.

1471
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,627
Oh, my.

1472
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:06,755
Be quiet. Don't let the neighbors see you.

1473
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:09,132
I see a big house,
but I don't see a boathouse.

1474
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:12,177
Maybe it's further back.
Get down, you're gonna kill yourself.

1475
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:15,347
We'll find another way.
We can go by the river and hide the car.

1476
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:16,932
Okay.

1477
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,394
Why don't you turn off that television?

1478
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,437
- I'm sick of it.
- I wanted that cabinet.

1479
01:38:22,647 --> 01:38:23,981
Don't touch the fence.

1480
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,358
I ain't crazy.
I don't want the shit shocked out of me.

1481
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:34,741
That must be Romey's place
over there by those trees.

1482
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:36,660
Yeah.

1483
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:42,374
- That looks like a boathouse.
- Yeah, but how we gonna get there?

1484
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:46,044
- Come on.
- No, Mark. Shoot.

1485
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,963
That's private property.

1486
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:50,674
Turn off the lights and come to bed.

1487
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,467
What the hell do you think I'm doing?

1488
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:54,886
Romey's neighbors sure are paranoid.

1489
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:57,389
You would be too
with the Mafia living next door.

1490
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,895
Don't touch it.

1491
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:11,486
Damn it.

1492
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,864
I'll look around here for another door.

1493
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:20,370
There's another door but it's locked too.
Be quiet. Careful.

1494
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,830
I'll try the window.

1495
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,251
Know how to get to Romey's?

1496
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:30,088
Yeah, everybody knows
how to get to Romey's, the smell.

1497
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,515
Be careful.

1498
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:44,269
Yeah, okay.

1499
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:47,773
Can you see anything?

1500
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,734
Yeah.

1501
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,404
Quiet.

1502
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:56,782
You'll wake up the neighbors.

1503
01:39:57,158 --> 01:40:00,702
- What do you see?
- It's definitely a boathouse.

1504
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,418
Wait a minute, what are you doing?
Don't go in.

1505
01:40:08,628 --> 01:40:11,171
I'll climb in and unlock the door
from the inside.

1506
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:13,382
Mark, you listen to me. Get down here.

1507
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:28,522
Mark?

1508
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:30,399
Mark? Shit.

1509
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:35,153
- Are you all right?
- Gotta see if the body's here.

1510
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:36,947
No, just let me in.

1511
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:40,742
- It's here.
- Will you open up this door? Come on.

1512
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:50,085
Mark, I'm gonna kill you
if you don't open this door.

1513
01:40:53,715 --> 01:40:55,841
What happened? Are you all right?

1514
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,260
Yeah, it's just a raccoon.

1515
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:00,053
Oh, good. Well, now let me in.

1516
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:19,906
- Watch the water. If anyone comes...
- I know how to keep lookout.

1517
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:22,284
Just take care of business.

1518
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:33,920
There's somebody coming.
I think it's Barry Muldano.

1519
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,381
- Open this door.
- It's locked.

1520
01:41:38,384 --> 01:41:40,385
I'm trapped.

1521
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:42,804
Got a key?

1522
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,026
- You hear something?
- No.

1523
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:03,283
- Getting paranoid in your old age, Barry?
- Shut up, asshole.

1524
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:10,248
Bye-bye, Rocky Raccoon.

1525
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,251
Leave a goddamn calling card,
why don't you?

1526
01:42:13,461 --> 01:42:16,588
I told you I heard something, asshole.

1527
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:23,887
- You buried him here?
- Yeah, under the boat.

1528
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:25,680
Give me one of those picks.

1529
01:42:25,848 --> 01:42:27,849
Rocket scientist you are.

1530
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:30,685
There are so many neighbors
around here.

1531
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:33,897
- Will you shut up and start digging?
- Yeah, yeah.

1532
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:01,424
Come on, let's move him out of here.

1533
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:10,517
Resurrection time, you old bastard.

1534
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,020
They found the body.

1535
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,189
Get out of there. Come on, right now.

1536
01:43:17,984 --> 01:43:20,527
Let's just get out of here.

1537
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:55,645
Hey!

1538
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:18,585
- You okay?
- Get this thing off of me.

1539
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:26,092
Run, Mark, run!

1540
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,270
You gonna die, bitch.

1541
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:40,398
Get off her. Now.

1542
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:42,901
I'm serious. Let her go.

1543
01:44:47,365 --> 01:44:49,199
Drop the knife.

1544
01:44:56,499 --> 01:44:57,916
Mr. Mark Sway.

1545
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:01,378
You a big man?
You a big man with a gun, Mark Sway?

1546
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:04,631
You're not gonna shoot anyone.

1547
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,259
Yes, I am.

1548
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:12,097
- Mark, give me the gun. Come on.
- No.

1549
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:13,723
He was gonna kill you.

1550
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:17,769
He was gonna kill me, and he would've
killed my mom and my little brother.

1551
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:21,940
You're just a scared little prick.
Probably piss your pants.

1552
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,902
- Come on, big man, pull the trigger.
- No, Mark. Mark.

1553
01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,239
If I just shoot...

1554
01:45:30,032 --> 01:45:31,449
everything will be okay.

1555
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:34,828
No, it won't you'll be just like him.
Please, come on.

1556
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:37,998
Give it to me.

1557
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:40,375
Mark, give it to me.

1558
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:44,254
Give it to me.

1559
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:51,261
You should've let the kid shoot, bitch.

1560
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,846
You haven't got the balls.

1561
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:57,225
Really?

1562
01:46:08,946 --> 01:46:10,071
Jesus Christ.

1563
01:46:10,531 --> 01:46:12,282
You robbing son of a bitch!

1564
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,035
- Damn!
- Who the hell are you?

1565
01:46:15,244 --> 01:46:18,496
No one's breaking into my place,
you son of a bitch.

1566
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:20,290
Goddamn it! I'm unarmed!

1567
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:23,585
Get in the house!

1568
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:28,548
Call the police.

1569
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:31,092
- What are you, nuts?
- We still got time.

1570
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:33,178
- Oh, yeah?
- Goddamn it.

1571
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,555
Cops gonna be here in a minute.
Get in the boat.

1572
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:40,602
Damn it!

1573
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:48,109
You're a genius.

1574
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:51,571
You're not bad yourself. Let's see
what we got before police get here.

1575
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:52,906
I wonder if he's home.

1576
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:00,497
Oh, God, he's home.

1577
01:47:14,095 --> 01:47:17,472
What's the cloak-and-dagger all about?
You know you can trust us.

1578
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:19,390
You three come here alone?

1579
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,851
- That the truth?
- Of course it is.

1580
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:25,438
Have one of them trot out to those
cars that aren't in the parking lot...

1581
01:47:25,648 --> 01:47:28,399
and get a pen from one of those agents
that aren't there.

1582
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:30,360
- Get me something to write with.
- Hi.

1583
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:32,487
You've been awful busy, Reggie.

1584
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:35,490
Obstruction of justice,
tampering with federal evidence...

1585
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:39,619
contributing to the delinquency
of a minor. You been real busy.

1586
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:42,122
Roy, I am so flattered that you noticed.

1587
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:44,624
You really see Boyd Boyette's body?

1588
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:48,294
- I smelled it too.
- Where is it?

1589
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:53,049
Here's a list of psychiatric hospitals
that specialize in children.

1590
01:47:53,259 --> 01:47:55,385
I want a bed for Ricky
in one of them by noon.

1591
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:58,096
I don't believe you're in a strong
bargaining position.

1592
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:00,557
You know where the body's at,
you better tell me.

1593
01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:02,350
I know where that body's at now...

1594
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,395
but I don't know where
that body's gonna be in three hours.

1595
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:08,731
Now, you wanna keep playing games
or you wanna make a deal?

1596
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,401
All right.

1597
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:13,403
What do you want?

1598
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:16,489
- You have access to a private jet?
- I do.

1599
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:17,907
Send it to Memphis.

1600
01:48:18,117 --> 01:48:21,536
Pick up Dianne and Ricky and their doctor.
We'll meet them at the airport.

1601
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:24,038
When Mark's on board
and the plane's in the air...

1602
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:26,916
I'll tell you where your body is.
How we doing so far?

1603
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:29,627
- I don't hear anything I can't live with.
- Okay.

1604
01:48:29,837 --> 01:48:32,338
The family enters
the witness-protection program...

1605
01:48:32,548 --> 01:48:35,383
soon as Ricky's better,
they choose their new city.

1606
01:48:35,593 --> 01:48:36,968
Agreed.

1607
01:48:37,178 --> 01:48:40,305
Complete change of identification
and a nice little house.

1608
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,640
White, with a walk-in closet.

1609
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:47,437
Well, write it down. "Walk-in closet."

1610
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:50,607
Is "walk-in" hyphenated?

1611
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:55,486
She's gonna need some starting-out money
and a nice new job.

1612
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:58,406
Okay, one of you guys
wanna type this up?

1613
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,660
Soon as Dianne signs it,
we'll live happily ever after.

1614
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,580
Give me some help, Reggie.

1615
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:08,082
How far is it to that body?

1616
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:14,505
Twelve little itty-bitty tiny minutes.

1617
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,885
- Thank you, Reggie.
- You're welcome, Roy.

1618
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:30,897
Yeah, they're on the move right now.

1619
01:49:32,942 --> 01:49:36,277
Here, give me your bag. Just get right in.

1620
01:50:04,682 --> 01:50:10,103
Sixteen-oh-three hours.
ETA for New Orleans, about 54 minutes.

1621
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:14,524
They screwed up! You shitheads!
You never walk away! Never!

1622
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:16,985
Now, settle down, Barry.

1623
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:19,362
Sometimes you gotta cut your losses
to survive.

1624
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:23,241
It's not too late. I can go back,
I can dig up that body myself.

1625
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:29,330
Why don't you let Gronke here drive you?
And take Bono along for company.

1626
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:32,417
You can all go together
for a nice long ride.

1627
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:34,460
No, Uncle Johnny, please.

1628
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:37,005
Let me go myself. I can handle it.

1629
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:39,882
And risk getting caught? No.

1630
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:44,178
No more risk, Barry. Barry "The Blade."

1631
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:45,888
No more.

1632
01:50:46,432 --> 01:50:48,266
Not ever.

1633
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:04,365
Welcome to New Orleans,
Mrs. Sway. Watch your step.

1634
01:51:04,575 --> 01:51:05,742
They're on the ground.

1635
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:08,077
On the way to the hanger
for ground transport.

1636
01:51:14,043 --> 01:51:15,084
Mom.

1637
01:51:17,963 --> 01:51:20,048
God, I'm sorry I worried you.

1638
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:24,719
- I'm glad you came.
- I'm not sure that I had that much choice.

1639
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:28,014
Mom, if you don't want me to tell them
where the body is, I won't.

1640
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:31,351
But they got this great hospital
in Phoenix for kids...

1641
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:35,021
and once Ricky gets better,
we can move anywhere we want.

1642
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,065
Canada, Connecticut, anywhere.

1643
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:39,984
Anyplace that starts with a C anyway.

1644
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:43,279
They... They told me
we'd have a real house.

1645
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,282
And some getting-started money.
Walk-in closet.

1646
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:52,330
- And later maybe a good job?
- Yeah.

1647
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:54,999
Can watch my boys grow up.

1648
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:57,960
Maybe even join the PTA.

1649
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:00,963
Whatever.

1650
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,676
Hell, I'm only 27 years old.

1651
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:07,678
You're due for a break.

1652
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:12,809
Look, about what all I said
in the hospital...

1653
01:52:13,018 --> 01:52:14,602
- Oh, no.
- I wanna apologize.

1654
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:16,938
No need. No need.

1655
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:20,691
And wherever your kids are...

1656
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:23,945
they're crazy
not to want you with them.

1657
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:29,033
Thank you.

1658
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:33,496
You know, like you said,
one day at a time.

1659
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:39,335
Phoenix.

1660
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,046
I sure do like the sound of that.

1661
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:52,515
Congratulations, Miss Sway. Jason
McThune will escort you to Phoenix...

1662
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:55,893
- ...take care of matters once you arrive.
- Right this way, Miss Sway.

1663
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:57,812
- All right, guys, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

1664
01:52:58,021 --> 01:53:00,189
- Come on.
- Let's go, boy. Come on.

1665
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:03,776
Thanks, Reverend Roy.
You've been a real pain in the ass.

1666
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:05,695
Thank you, son, and good luck to you.

1667
01:53:05,904 --> 01:53:09,031
I assure you, you have been
an even larger pain in the ass.

1668
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:10,241
Give me five. All right.

1669
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:25,298
You can't come with us, can you?

1670
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:31,929
When you enter the witness-protection
program, you have to sever all ties.

1671
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,809
I'll never see you again, will I?

1672
01:53:38,020 --> 01:53:39,061
No.

1673
01:53:41,815 --> 01:53:43,691
Look, you wanna...?

1674
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:46,486
You wanna take care of my compass,
for me?

1675
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,160
That way,
you'll never lose your way again.

1676
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,298
I love you, Reggie.

1677
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:11,677
I know, sweet boy, I love you too.

1678
01:54:13,347 --> 01:54:15,181
You better go with your mama.

1679
01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:18,434
Okay?

1680
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:28,027
I'll call you.

1681
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:40,998
The body is behind Romey Clifford's house,
in his boathouse.

1682
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:43,042
1214 East Brookline.

1683
01:54:43,252 --> 01:54:45,336
Oh, my.

1684
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,381
You did very well, Ms. Love.

1685
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:51,217
Reggie. Thank you, Roy.

1686
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:53,135
Oh, you forgot one thing.

1687
01:54:53,345 --> 01:54:56,597
You should have demanded immunity
for your illegal actions.

1688
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:04,522
Oh, an eye for an eye.

1689
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,649
Exodus, 21:24.

1690
01:55:06,858 --> 01:55:10,861
Let me tell you something, when I get to be
governor of Louisiana, do you want a job?

1691
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:15,074
- I got one, thank you.
- Showtime, Roy.

1692
01:55:18,328 --> 01:55:19,370
Thank you, Reggie.

1693
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:21,956
Thank Mark.

1694
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:31,591
Hey.

1695
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:36,804
Y'all come over here and gather round,
if you will, please.

1696
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:40,016
- Come on, come on, come on.
- We have a...

1697
01:55:40,225 --> 01:55:44,186
After what I must say has been
an exhaustive investigation on our part...

1698
01:55:44,396 --> 01:55:46,647
we are able to make
the solemn announcement...

1699
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:50,151
that we have recovered the body
of Senator Boyd Boyette.

1700
01:56:16,803 --> 01:56:18,179
He's quite a kid.

1701
01:56:18,388 --> 01:56:21,390
Don't tell him he's a kid,
he'll just get real pissed off.
