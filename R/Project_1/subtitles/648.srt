This isn't really
the broodiest.

177
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,289
And then, these scary black
holes open up in the ground.

178
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:51,828
They started to suck everybody I've
ever cared about out of my life!

179
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,131

And he shouted...</i>

No!

183
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:02,873
And you disappeared
into the void,

184
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,342
never to be seen again.

185
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:06,910
Not bad brooding!

186

187
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,647
That was definitely

No, no, no.
This is my vision of the future.

197
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,839
Planty's room,
[whispers] kitty cat room...

198
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,473
Of course, the kitchen,

199
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,276
complete with breakfast nook,
lunchtime nook, and fireman pole.

200
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,046

203
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,951

204
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:52,388
So you can have toast
or waffles at any time!

205
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,791
[Wyldstyle] Oh!

206
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,792
And out back,
a double-decker porch swing,

207
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:58,394
so we can always
hang together!

208

209
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,399
Uh... Wow. Um...

210
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,566
It's sweet.

211
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:05,534
It is. It's just, uh...

212
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:09,205
It's going to attract aliens
and get destroyed.

213
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,840
But maybe it won't.

214
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,409
I just thought
we could rebuild the future.

215
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,680

216
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:16,913
[sighs] Emmet...

217
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:19,215
You gotta stop pretending
everything is awesome.

218
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:20,518
It isn't.

219
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,186
Every morning,
you walk through town,

220
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,088
singing that terrible,
annoying, manufactured pop song!

221
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,556
[chuckles] That song
really seems to upset you.

222
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:29,659
- No, it doesn't.
- Oh, my mistake.

223
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:32,628
That song was fine
when we were younger,

224
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,233
but we also have to
grow up sometime.

225
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:37,669
Can you do that for me?

226
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,239
Well, yeah. I can try.

227
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:46,377
But it's easy for you.
You were always a dark, goth rebel.

228
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,710
[scoffs] Yes, of course I was.

229
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,345
- Let's change the subject.
- Okay.

230
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:52,582
We have to be hardened and battle-ready.
Both of us.

231
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,149
Yeah. No, I get it.

232
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,787
And that's why I've cultivated
a totally hard-edged side

233
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,888
that's super tough
and... Look, look!

234

Make a wish! [gasps]

Oh, no!

236
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:05,795
What? Can't think of anything
to wish for?

237
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,263

for more wishes,

693
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:56,606
Hey, you broke my ship.

694
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:58,874
Listen, kid,
you can build anything,

695
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,842
but there ain't nothing
you can't break.

696
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:02,644
[both laughing]

697
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:03,812
I don't get it.

698
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,848
How about a tour?

699
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,783
Behold, the <i>Rexcelsior.</i>

700
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:11,186
[Emmet] Whoa-ho-ho!

701
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:12,888
Are those dinosaurs?

702
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,793
[raptors chittering,
screeching]

703
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:23,131
[laughs] Whoa!

704
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,266
[Rex] Tell me,
what's a scrapabout like you

705
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:28,302
doing trying to
go through the Stairgate?

706
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:31,006
Aliens from the Systar System
kidnapped my friends.

707
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:32,808
I'm going to get them back.

708
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,745
You don't wanna go anywhere near
the Systar System, trust me.

709
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:40,549
It's ruled by an alien queen,
and she'll try to brainwash your friends,

710
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:44,719
so she can use 'em in a matrimonial
ceremony to bring forth...

711
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:46,621
- Armamageddon?
- Bingo.

712
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:49,625
You've been to the Systar System?
You can help me.

713
00:32:49,627 --> 00:32:51,461
Forget it, kid.

714
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:53,262
That place is too terrible.

715
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:56,965
But I don't like to talk about
my backstory, so don't even ask.

716
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,867
- Oh. Okay.
- There I was,

717
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:00,869
<i>on a galactic mission.</i>

718
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:03,805
<i>Ended up being
more than I'd bargained for.</i>

719
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,774
[screaming]

720
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,876
[clattering]

721
00:33:07,878 --> 00:33:10,311
<i>I landed
in the desolate plains</i>

722
00:33:10,313 --> 00:33:14,049
<i>of the dust planet Undar
of the Dryar System.</i>

723
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:17,219
- [machine rumbling]
- <i>The winds were ferocious.</i>

724
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:20,755
- [wind whistling]
- <i>The isolation, intense.</i>

725
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:21,991
[indistinct chatter]

726
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:23,626
<i>I waited for my friends.</i>

727
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,230
[chatter continues]

728
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:29,366
<i>Seemed to last forever.</i>

729
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,442
<i>That's when I learned...</i>

730
00:33:39,744 --> 00:33:42,645
There was no one
I could trust but me.

731
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:44,813
I'm so sorry, Rex.

732
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:48,216
Don't be. My time alone
was an awakening.

733
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:51,019
I learned how
the universe really works.

734
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,821
Yeah, I know how you feel.

735
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,690
Ha! You couldn't possibly
know how it feels.

736
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,359
Yeah, I do.

737
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:59,928
Like you can't ever go back
to the person you used to be.

738
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,495
Even though it was
so much simpler.

739
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,934
- You have to find your own way.
- [raptor chirps]

740
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:06,801
But you just don't know how.

741
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:08,037
Hold up a second.

742
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:10,773
- You have been there.
- Yeah.

743
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:13,276
What's your last name, Emmet?

744
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:14,477
Brickowski.

745
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,077
No way.

746
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,479
The visionary
double-decker-couch-building hero

747
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:20,816
who took it to Lord Business
and had the guts

748
00:34:20,818 --> 00:34:22,050
to face The Man Upstairs?

749
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,720
That Emmet Brickowski?

750
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:26,222
Yeah.

751
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,088
Dude! Big fan!

752
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,158
Wait, you are a fan of me?

753
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,827
Heck yeah. You're the reason
I started wearing vests.

754
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:34,262
- Do you like mine?
- Yes, I do!

755
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:36,566
- [laughing]
- [raptor roars]

756
00:34:36,568 --> 00:34:40,334
Also started wearing chaps,
which are essentially leg-vests.

757
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:43,972
Wow. You're so much more cool
and grown-up than me.

758
00:34:43,974 --> 00:34:46,075
[gasps] You could teach me!

759
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:49,111
Rex, help me rescue my
friends, stop Armamageddon,

760
00:34:49,113 --> 00:34:51,613
and teach me to be like you.

761
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,249
Someone Lucy will be proud of.

762
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:57,852
And I'll be the brother
you never had.

763
00:34:57,854 --> 00:35:00,824
Unless you do have a brother.
I don't really know you that well.

764
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:06,128
All right, kid, you listen.

765
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,231
You go soft,
you're playing their game.

766
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,966
You're gonna have to grow up
and grow up fast.

767
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:13,602
Are you ready to do that?

768
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:15,604
Yes, I am.

769
00:35:15,606 --> 00:35:17,340
I can't hear you.

770
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:19,374
Really? I was speaking
at normal volume.

771
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:21,176
Sorry, man. I'm just
a little hard of hearing

772
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:23,044
from listening to
my mixtapes super loud

773
00:35:23,046 --> 00:35:24,745
with no regard
for my future hearing,

774
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,115
because I live in the now.

775
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:29,117
Raptors, re-coordinate.

776
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,921
- Really?
- Set a course for the Systar System.

777
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,557
Rex, I promise
you won't regret it.

778
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,294
Kid, I invented the phrase
"no regrets."

779
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:42,363
I do have one regret
of not trademarking it.

780
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:43,367
Space cannons.

781
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:46,068
Hyper-light-speed combustor.

782
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,470
[powering up]

783
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:49,171
[on speakers]
Super-rad ejector button.

784
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:50,740
Whoa. Isn't there
a better place to put that?

785
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:51,941
Raptors, power up.

786
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,041
Crank the warp drive up to 11.

787
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:55,412
- Times two.
- [raptor chirps]

788
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,551
Yeah!

789
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,390
To the Systar System.

790
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:08,392
[engine revving]

791
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,862
[Finn imitates engine revving]

792
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,030
[Wyldstyle] That queen
is never gonna break us.

793
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:17,099
She just wants
to throw a party.

794
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:19,936
It's clearly a cover
for some catastrophic event.

795
00:36:19,938 --> 00:36:21,303
Yeah. Marriage, am I right?

796
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,437
No one's tying down
this Batman forever.

797
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,073
Ooh, reference!

798
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:28,577
[scoffs] No. The moment you say,
"I do," it'll unlock some...

799
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:31,579
- What are you looking at?
- What are you hiding?

800
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:32,814
What are you hiding?

801
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,948
You're the one with

802
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,082
the reflective mask.

803
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:36,184
Well, I asked you first.

804
00:36:36,186 --> 00:36:37,586
Well, I asked you second.

805
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:39,687
- [General Mayhem] Real mature.
- [gasps]

806
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:40,921
So, where are we going?

807
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:42,959
[General Mayhem]
Planet Sparkles.

808
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,260
Sparkles.

809
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:49,365
There, you will get changed
in more ways than one.

810
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,832
Hello!

811
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,334
What was that?

812
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,171
I said,
[in high-pitched voice] "Hello!"

813
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,106
Well, we've been talking
for a while.

814
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:58,908
I'm not sure
why you're saying hello now...

815
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,112
But fine. Hello to you.

816
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:13,754
Stick together.
I've got a plan.

817
00:37:13,756 --> 00:37:15,691
Greetings, Bricksburgians.

818
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,426
Welcome to the
Palace of Infinite Reflection.

819
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:21,696
A self-reeducation
celebrity center.

820
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,231
Namaste.

821
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,733
Ooh! Sounds spiritual.

822
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,135
It is so spiritual.

823
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:29,137
Sounds like a trap.
This guy's a vampire.

824
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:31,840
Attractive non-threatening
teen vampire.

825
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:33,441
I like to talk about feelings,

826
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:36,278
and how we're in love,
but can't be together.

827
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,546
Isn't that beautiful?

828
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,948
I'll answer that.
It's very beautiful.

829
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,216
The heart wants what it wants.

830
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,387
I also DJ on the side
and wear women's jeans.

831
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,588
Wow!

832
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,124
Guys, we have to stay tough
and gritty.

833
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:51,961
Do not let them
soften you up...

834
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:56,263
Oh, yeah. I love getting barnacles
scrubbed off me bilge pump.

835
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:57,832
Really? Right into it.

836
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:59,001
[laughing] Oh, oh! It tickles.

837
00:37:59,003 --> 00:38:00,836
- [whirring]
- Whee!

838
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,106
Oh, yeah, I carry my tortured
past in my chiseled glutes.

839
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,841
[scoffs] Even you?

840
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:09,010
What? I mean,
I'm not gonna turn down a free massage.

841
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:11,113
She needs extra treatment.

842
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:12,814
- No!
- Yes.

843
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,316
- First, you'll get a hot gem massage.
- [Wyldstyle exclaiming]

844
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:16,651
Then an exfoliating
flower beatdown.

845
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:18,720
- Popsicle face mask and peel.
- [grunting]

846
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,323
- Room-temperature stone contusion.
- [muffled] Hey!

847
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:22,992
Vegetable observation...

848
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:24,392
And be cleansed
with a glitter scrub

849
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,093
- and sparkle rinse.
- Ah!

850
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,463
- Next...
- [screams]

851
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:28,967
- Your hair!
- It's...

852
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:32,334
- It's beautiful.
- Wait, what?

853
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:34,035
- [all gasp]
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

854
00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:35,537
- [Unikitty] What? Wow!
- [Wyldstyle chuckles nervously]

855
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,439
Guys, this is not
what you think.

856
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,142
It's so adorable and cute!

857
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:42,711
Are you covering up
some un-dark past?

858
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:45,780
No. It's not who I am.
It's just hair.

859
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,418
Look, if I pop it off,
am I Bruce Willis now?

860
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:50,318
I don't think so.

861
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,321
Well, well, well.
I thought ye were tough.

862
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:55,356
Looks like the peg's
on the other leg.

863
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:57,124
- I didn't...
- Is she secretly cutesy?

864
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,961

[General Mayhem] I've detected
a deep emptiness in him.

1206
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,909
According to my calculations,
he's lonely.

1207
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:10,447
- Among other things.
- [munching]

1208
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,282
I know how he feels.

1209
00:53:14,284 --> 00:53:16,117
I mean,
what a weirdo. [scoffs]

1210
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:17,986
I totally
don't relate to that.

1211
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:20,754
The time
for Armamageddon nears.

1212
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:22,323
We must find a weakness.

1213
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:24,693
- If he doesn't say "I do," we...
- Relax, girl.

1214
00:53:24,695 --> 00:53:26,593
I got this.

1215
00:53:26,595 --> 00:53:28,629

I'll just leave you two alone.

Listen, lady, don't try
any mind games.

1219
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:41,608
Batman is a permanent
Bat-chelor.

1220
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,180
Can you imagine if having a
family with someone I loved

1221
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:48,350
healed some of
my darkest trauma?

1222
00:53:48,352 --> 00:53:49,350
Barf.

1223
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:51,686
There is no way
I'm marrying you.

1224
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:53,053
Well, of course not.

1225
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,954
Oh. Uh...
Yeah, but you said that...

1226
00:53:54,956 --> 00:53:56,524
I wanted to marry you?

1227
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:58,158
No, no, no, honey.

1228
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,059

1229
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:02,664
I actually

1230
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:05,265
Good. So, I guess
we're done here or...

1231

[chuckles] Yeah. And, um...

1234
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,109
Out of curiosity, why wouldn't
you wanna marry me?

1235
00:54:15,111 --> 00:54:18,512
Just, you know, again,
purely for curiosity sake.

1236

00:59:41,436 --> 00:59:44,338
[Batman] "The union
of Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

1373
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,273
and Bruce Margolis Batman."

1374
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:48,575
I will say it is nice
that you have a vegan option,

1375
00:59:48,577 --> 00:59:51,378
but we're gonna have to
reprint these all in black.

1376
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,580
- Bam!
- I like it.

1377
00:59:53,582 --> 00:59:57,151
And instead of releasing
doves, how about bats?

1378
00:59:57,153 --> 00:59:58,651
- [bats screeching]
- Ta-da!

1379
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:00,486
Sweet! I got an idea.

1380
01:00:00,488 --> 01:00:03,256
What if, instead of throwing a
bouquet, if I throw a batarang,

1381
01:00:03,258 --> 01:00:04,758
and whoever's chest
it lodges in

1382
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,394
is the next to get married?

1383
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:08,695
[chuckles] Love it, babe.

1384
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:11,231
I did not expect this
to be so much fun.

1385
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:14,100
Who would've thought that
this incorrigible gadabout

1386
01:00:14,102 --> 01:00:15,568
would ever tie the knot?

1387
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,805
People change. I change,
like, every five seconds.

1388
01:00:18,807 --> 01:00:19,907
Like this, boom.

1389
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,209
Oh. Uh-huh. [chuckles]

1390
01:00:21,211 --> 01:00:23,144
I mean, this morning
I was all alone.

1391
01:00:23,146 --> 01:00:26,579
Living in a giant palace with
only a fussy British servant,

1392
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,615
and no one
who could really relate to me.

1393
01:00:28,617 --> 01:00:30,517
I can really relate to that.

1394
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:33,019
But along the way,
it got real.

1395
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,555
So, so real.

1396
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:36,490
Look at us,
two different worlds.

1397
01:00:36,492 --> 01:00:38,191
Two people
who just need someone

1398
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:39,459
who understands us...

1399
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:41,361
[both] To find real happiness.

1400
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:42,963
- Whoa! Jinx.
- Jinx!

1401
01:00:42,965 --> 01:00:44,097
[both] Jinx.

1402
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,499
And final jinx.

1403
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,035
Oh, you're so jinxed,
both of you, aren't you?

1404
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:49,370
So, let's stop this forever.

1405
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:51,104
Have you been here
the whole time?

1406
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,809
Yeah. And I'm sad about it.

1407
01:00:57,046 --> 01:00:58,812
[General Mayhem]
So, then the centaur says,

1408
01:00:58,814 --> 01:01:00,580
"That's not the half
I'm talking about."

1409
01:01:00,582 --> 01:01:01,916
[all laughing]

1410
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:04,385
Okay, target detected.
I'm closing in.

1411
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:06,387
- [Rex] <i>10-4, good buddy.</i>
- [Emmet] <i>10-4 you, good buddy.</i>

1412
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:08,155
[Rex] <i>You're the good buddy,
buddy.</i>

1413
01:01:08,157 --> 01:01:09,689
- [Emmet] <i>Is that Bruce Willis?</i>
- [Bruce Willis] <i>Hey, guys.</i>

1414
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:11,760
[Rex laughing]
<i>Good one, Bruce Willis!</i>

1415
01:01:13,595 --> 01:01:15,162
Get to the bridal suite
without getting brainwashed.

1416
01:01:15,164 --> 01:01:16,696
Think hard thoughts.

1417
01:01:16,698 --> 01:01:18,432
Brood. Brood. Brood!

1418
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:19,733
Brood!

1419
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:20,968
Did you just say "brood"?

1420
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:23,570
No, "bride"!
I need to see the bride.

1421
01:01:23,572 --> 01:01:26,506
I'm sorry, no entry allowed.
Who are you?

1422
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:29,309
Who, me? [laughing]

1423
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:30,711
I'm your worst nightmare.

1424
01:01:30,713 --> 01:01:33,113
You're me when I'm late
to school,

1425
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:36,117
and I forgot my homework and
my pants are made of pudding?

1426
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:38,551
No, I don't... [grunts]

1427
01:01:38,553 --> 01:01:40,423
- [punches landing]
- [grunting]

1428
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:46,426
[Queen Watevra] Mayhem!
Is everything in order for the ceremony?

1429
01:01:46,428 --> 01:01:48,796
Yes, I will operate
everything here

1430
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:51,532
from this
home entertainment center.

1431
01:01:51,534 --> 01:01:53,133
There it is.

1432
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:54,234
[Batman] You so get me.

1433
01:01:54,236 --> 01:01:55,803
No. You so get me.

1434
01:01:55,805 --> 01:01:57,604
No, no, no. You so get me.

1435
01:01:57,606 --> 01:01:58,939
They brainwashed Batman.

1436
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,707
Wow, they're good,
because he is dense.

1437
01:02:00,709 --> 01:02:02,642
Let's both say the first word
that pops in our heads

1438
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:03,811
and see if it's the same.

1439
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:05,611
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1440
01:02:05,613 --> 01:02:07,247
- Party!
- Batman!

1441
01:02:07,249 --> 01:02:08,983
Oh, that's crazy,
'cause Batman is all for partying.

1442
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:10,950
- So, that's basically the same word.
- Totally.

1443
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:12,051
Totally.

1444
01:02:12,053 --> 01:02:13,120
- Totally.
- Totally.

1445
01:02:13,122 --> 01:02:14,921
Final totally. And end it.

1446
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:16,524
We've gotta get upstairs.
The show's starting.

1447
01:02:16,526 --> 01:02:18,524
Mayhem,
do the boopity-bop-bop.

1448
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,928
[automated voice]
Boopity-bop-bop.

1449
01:02:23,832 --> 01:02:25,865
Bring down the house,
my queen.

1450
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,003
This house is about to
get tore up.

1451
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:40,448
We've been expecting you.

1452
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:44,352
Then expect the unexpected!

1453
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:45,887
[General Mayhem]
Did you expect this?

1454
01:02:45,889 --> 01:02:47,687
- [grunts] Yes.
- [groans]

1455
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:51,291
[General Mayhem] Well,
I expected your expecting our expecting.

1456
01:02:51,293 --> 01:02:55,195
And I expected your expecting
of my expecting your...

1457
01:02:55,197 --> 01:02:56,733
Wait, now I'm lost.

1458
01:02:57,465 --> 01:02:59,735
[Star Duplos] Yay! Whee!

1459
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:02,472
[both yelling]

1460
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:05,439
[grunts]

1461
01:03:05,441 --> 01:03:07,407
[groans] I feel dizzy.

1462
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,811
[retching]

1463
01:03:10,113 --> 01:03:12,115
[crowd cheering]

1464
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,655
Citizens of the 11 planets
of the Systar System!

1465
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:24,258
I ask you
to put your hands together

1466
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,258
and apart, and together again

1467
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,595
in a repeated fashion.

1468
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,033
[rhythmic clapping]

1469
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,336
[Emmet] Broody Judy,
this is Stubble Trouble.

1470
01:03:37,338 --> 01:03:38,939
What's your status?

1471
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:41,240
- Hello? Lucy?
- [static on radio]

1472
01:03:41,242 --> 01:03:42,642
She's not answering.

1473
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:44,278
- Uh-oh.
- Is that bad?

1474
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,912
An "uh-oh"? Never good.

1475
01:03:45,914 --> 01:03:47,481
I thought she might've been

1476
01:03:47,483 --> 01:03:49,350
more brainwashed
than she was letting on.

1477
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:53,254
No. No, not Lucy.
She is the toughest there is.

1478
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:55,625
Unless that song got stuck
in her head.

1479
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,158
Lucy. Lucy?

1480
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,263
- <i>Come on, Lucy, where are you?</i>
- [grunting]

1481
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,830
Allow me to introduce...

1482
01:04:03,832 --> 01:04:05,164
The wedding party.

1483
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:07,667
Supporting the bride
are Marie Curie...

1484
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:09,470
Chocolate Bar...

1485
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:10,771
The Tin Man...

1486
01:04:10,773 --> 01:04:12,905
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

1487
01:04:12,907 --> 01:04:15,475
Bearing the rings, Banana.

1488
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,644
Okay, okay. You can do this.

1489
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:19,211
Don't mess this... [yelps]

1490
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:21,582
- [crowd groans]
- I messed it up! I messed it up!

1491
01:04:21,584 --> 01:04:23,117
[grunting] No!

1492
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,684
- [crowd gasps]
- I'm slipping! Don't look at me!

1493
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,921
No! [groans]

1494
01:04:26,923 --> 01:04:29,289
- [crowd gasps]
- This is my nightmare!

1495
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:31,593
I had a dream about this!
Don't look at me!

1496
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:36,597
[Ice Cream Cone] And on the groom's
side, MetalBeard...

1497
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,265
[plays trumpet] Arr!

1498
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:39,966
- [Ice Cream Cone] Unikitty...
- Hi!

1499
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:41,702
[Ice Cream Cone]
And that spaceman, Benny.

1500
01:04:41,704 --> 01:04:43,169
Spaceship!

1501
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,604
Oh, no, my friends.

1502
01:04:44,606 --> 01:04:46,006
I barely recognize them.

1503
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,740
Don't worry
about your friends.

1504
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:49,042
Don't worry about Lucy.

1505
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:51,778
Focus on what you need to do.

1506
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:54,784
Visualize your success.
[echoing]

1507
01:04:56,985 --> 01:04:58,854
[grunts]

1508
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:03,256
- [rumbling]
- He did it!

1509
01:05:03,258 --> 01:05:04,825
He's so tough!

1510
01:05:04,827 --> 01:05:07,227
We were so wrong about him.

1511
01:05:07,229 --> 01:05:08,865
Way to go, Emmet.

1512
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,100
You've changed, perfectly.

1513
01:05:13,434 --> 01:05:15,167
Your future is bright.

1514
01:05:15,169 --> 01:05:19,071
Right now, we gotta deal
with the present.

1515
01:05:19,073 --> 01:05:23,644
Wow! My own Rex Vest?
[laughs]

1516
01:05:23,646 --> 01:05:26,113
Thanks for helping me change
for the tougher.

1517
01:05:26,115 --> 01:05:28,117
Don't thank me,
thank yourself.

1518
01:05:29,084 --> 01:05:31,588
Catch you on the flip. Hey-yo!

1519
01:05:34,456 --> 01:05:35,823
[Wonder Woman] Uh-oh.

1520
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:38,091
Ugh! I left my lasso in there!

1521
01:05:38,093 --> 01:05:42,231
And now presenting
Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi...

1522
01:05:43,365 --> 01:05:44,698
Hey!

1523
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,099
[Ice Cream Cone]
And also Batman.

1524
01:05:46,101 --> 01:05:48,671
- [rock music playing]
- Commitment!

1525
01:05:49,671 --> 01:05:50,974
[powering up]

1526
01:05:55,477 --> 01:05:57,644
You look beautiful.

1527
01:05:57,646 --> 01:05:59,245
You look stunning.

1528
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,780
You are so right.

1529
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:02,349
I know this is
a strange thing to say

1530
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:03,916
to the person
I'm about to marry,

1531
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:07,488
but I actually think
I really like you.

1532
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:08,588
Samesies.

1533
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,155
- Totally. Totally.
- Totally.

1534
01:06:10,157 --> 01:06:13,459
And bring it to a merciful end.
Can we start now?

1535
01:06:13,461 --> 01:06:14,727
- Supes!
- [sighs]

1536
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:16,796
I'm getting hitched.
Feeling jelly?

1537
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:18,198
Not at all!

1538
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,901
Oh, it's burning
you up inside.

1539
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:23,403
[General Mayhem] You don't
understand who the queen is

1540
01:06:23,405 --> 01:06:25,872
and what we're trying to do.

1541
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:27,909
She's trying to
attack us, obviously.

1542
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:30,413
You attacked us!

1543
01:06:31,347 --> 01:06:33,347
No, you started it.

1544
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:35,282
No, you started it.

1545
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:36,318
[both grunting]

1546
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:41,021
Well, now I'm gonna end it.

1547
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,825
- [Heart Bomb Duplo] Hello!
- [General Mayhem] No!

1548
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:44,927
[General Mayhem screams]

1549
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,869
[General Mayhem groaning]

1550
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,372
[gasps]

1551
01:06:57,673 --> 01:07:00,109
Help me. Please.

1552
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:04,111
Okay, I'm not falling for it.
No. Uh-uh.

1553
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:05,148
No way.

1554
01:07:06,548 --> 01:07:08,117
[whimpers]

1555
01:07:10,186 --> 01:07:13,320
Nope. Mmm-mmm.
Nope. Stop.

1556
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:15,488
Uh-uh. No. Ugh!

1557
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,860
No, I will not care about...

1558
01:07:23,698 --> 01:07:25,967
[gasps, screaming]

1559
01:07:27,769 --> 01:07:29,137
[panting]

1560
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:34,841
[both grunt]

1561
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,379
[both panting]

1562
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:39,780
You do care.

1563
01:07:39,782 --> 01:07:42,182
I knew there was some
sweetness under that darkness.

1564
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:44,450
What are you talking about?
You're the bad guys, okay?

1565
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,387
Maybe in your world.
But here, we don't see it that way.

1566
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:48,923
Okay, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

1567
01:07:48,925 --> 01:07:50,823
Your whole costume and mask

1568
01:07:50,825 --> 01:07:54,028
and all the stomping around acting
like you're the boss of us...

1569
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,262
Because it's the only way
you'll listen!

1570
01:07:56,264 --> 01:07:58,398
I tried to wear a mask
and talk tough,

1571
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,869
a language I thought you'd understand,
and it totally did not work.

1572
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:04,204
All we wanna do is
unite our worlds in peace.

1573
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,705
Why didn't you guys
just tell us that?

1574
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,340
We tried.

1575
01:08:07,342 --> 01:08:09,575
The queen sang a whole song
about how not evil she was.

1576
01:08:09,577 --> 01:08:11,111
That was the truth?

1577
01:08:11,113 --> 01:08:13,279
You guys
are terrible communicators.

1578
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:14,914
[sighs] I know.

1579
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,483
Come with me.

1580
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:18,851
For years, we've tried to join
you, to play with you.

1581
01:08:18,853 --> 01:08:21,888
<i>But you've always
pushed us away.</i>

1582
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:26,459
<i>Now all of our fighting has brought
us to the brink of Armamageddon.</i>

1583
01:08:26,461 --> 01:08:28,395
But this wedding
can change all that.

1584
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:31,765
Bring us together
and stop Armamageddon.

1585
01:08:31,767 --> 01:08:33,633
It'll make
everything awesome again.

1586
01:08:33,635 --> 01:08:37,637
But everything isn't awesome,
it's, it's, uh...

1587
01:08:37,639 --> 01:08:38,837
- [gasps]
- [crowd cheering]

1588
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:40,606
[Ice Cream Cone] And now,

1589
01:08:40,608 --> 01:08:43,912
the queen will change
into her original form.

1590
01:08:51,219 --> 01:08:53,121
- [crowd cheering]
- [gasps]

1591
01:08:55,491 --> 01:08:57,824
See? Friends.

1592
01:08:57,826 --> 01:08:59,195
[Duplos] Ooh!

1593
01:09:02,464 --> 01:09:04,431
The queen was from Emmet.

1594
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:07,400
Those bricks
inspired our world.

1595
01:09:07,402 --> 01:09:09,601
We exist because of you.

1596
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,337
You started it.

1597
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:12,972
We started it?

1598
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:14,841
You started everything.

1599
01:09:14,843 --> 01:09:17,546
We look up to you.
Always have.

1600
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,079
[MetalBeard] Wyldstyle!

1601
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:21,882
[Benny] Where have you been?

1602
01:09:21,884 --> 01:09:23,551
- Oh, you guys aren't brainwashed?
- [upbeat music playing]

1603
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:25,218
[laughing] Brainwashed? No!

1604
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,654
We're just happy.
It's so much more fun here.

1605
01:09:27,656 --> 01:09:30,524
There are so many more
spaceships on this adventure!

1606
01:09:30,526 --> 01:09:32,358
And yet not nearly enough.

1607
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,897
Wait, if you guys are good,
then who's the bad guy?

1608
01:09:38,032 --> 01:09:40,900
Stubble Trouble,
this is Alpha Wolf-Bro Dog.

1609
01:09:40,902 --> 01:09:43,102
I'm almost
in Rextraction position.

1610
01:09:43,104 --> 01:09:44,636
<i>What's the color
on the ground?</i>

1611
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,006
[Emmet whispers] Fuchsia.

1612
01:09:46,008 --> 01:09:47,274
Rex, I see Lucy.

1613
01:09:47,276 --> 01:09:49,309
But she isn't taking down
the shields.

1614
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:51,611
[Rex] <i>You don't need Lucy.
You don't need anyone.</i>

1615
01:09:51,613 --> 01:09:54,882
If you focus,
you can make a punch so powerful,

1616
01:09:54,884 --> 01:09:57,249
you'll take it down,
shields and all.

1617
01:09:57,251 --> 01:09:59,752
<i>You've got the power
inside you.</i>

1618
01:09:59,754 --> 01:10:02,154
I can do this. I can do this.

1619
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:05,359
I can't not do this.

1620
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:07,560
So glad you aren't gonna
destroy this ceremony.

1621
01:10:07,562 --> 01:10:10,196
If anything bad were to
happen, we'd all be doomed.

1622
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:12,634
But luckily, there's nothing
to worry about now.

1623
01:10:13,602 --> 01:10:15,002
Oh, no.

1624
01:10:15,004 --> 01:10:16,205
Emmet.

1625
01:10:19,575 --> 01:10:20,707
[gasps]

1626
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:22,545
[grunting]

1627
01:10:24,912 --> 01:10:26,579
- Emmet!
- Lucy, what are you doing?

1628
01:10:26,581 --> 01:10:28,715
Did you draw stubble dots
on your face?

1629
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:30,316
What? No. [chuckles]

1630
01:10:30,318 --> 01:10:32,718
Listen to me.
I was wrong about the queen.

1631
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,186
No. No, no, no.

1632
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,355
- Rex was right about you.
- No, you can't do this.

1633
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,158
You're just stopping me
because you're brainwashed.

1634
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,693
I'm not brainwashed!

1635
01:10:39,695 --> 01:10:41,159
That's exactly what a
brainwashed person would say.

1636
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:42,794
[MetalBeard] Ahoy, Emmet.

1637
01:10:42,796 --> 01:10:43,997
What happened to you?

1638
01:10:43,999 --> 01:10:46,432
A betoughening, it seems.

1639
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:48,435
[Ice Cream Cone]
Do you, Queen Watevra,

1640
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:51,437
take Batman to be your
special best partner?

1641
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:52,538
I do.

1642
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,108
Hurry up, kid,
we're running outta time.

1643
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:56,642
Guys, get out of my way.

1644
01:10:56,644 --> 01:10:59,178
If you want to do harm
to yon wedding,

1645
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:02,181
you will have to
get by we first.

1646
01:11:02,183 --> 01:11:04,650
I'm sorry,
but this is for your own good.

1647
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:06,052
[yells]

1648
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,024
[all screaming]

1649
01:11:10,425 --> 01:11:11,791
Emmet! Come back!

1650
01:11:11,793 --> 01:11:13,195
[grunting]

1651
01:11:14,463 --> 01:11:15,428
Don't do this.

1652
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:17,529
[Rex] <i>Don't listen to her!</i>

1653
01:11:17,531 --> 01:11:18,664
Almost there...

1654
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:20,937
Oh, come on! No!
Not all the way down!

1655
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:23,270
[Wyldstyle] Stop, Ems.

1656
01:11:23,272 --> 01:11:25,872
You don't know
what you're doing!

1657
01:11:25,874 --> 01:11:27,172
This isn't the real you.

1658
01:11:27,174 --> 01:11:29,809
This is the real me.

1659
01:11:29,811 --> 01:11:33,312
- The truth is, this is my real hair.
- [gasps]

1660
01:11:33,314 --> 01:11:36,149
I used to sing and dance
and have colorful hair.

1661
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,019
And I even loved
"Everything Is Awesome."

1662
01:11:39,021 --> 01:11:40,486
No, no. You would've told me.

1663
01:11:40,488 --> 01:11:42,623
You hate that music.
It isn't you.

1664
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:44,891
Yes, I darkened my hair
with marker,

1665
01:11:44,893 --> 01:11:47,694
'cause I wanted people to
think I was cool and grown up.

1666
01:11:47,696 --> 01:11:50,163
And then I tried to change you
into someone tough, too.

1667
01:11:50,165 --> 01:11:54,199
And I was wrong.
I like you the way you were.

1668
01:11:54,201 --> 01:11:57,238
Sweet, innocent, kind.

1669
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,509
The real Lucy
would never say that.

1670
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:05,745
[Ice Cream Cone]
Do you, Batman,

1671
01:12:05,747 --> 01:12:07,413
take Queen Watevra

1672
01:12:07,415 --> 01:12:09,315
- to be your special best partner?
- [Emmet yelling]

1673
01:12:09,317 --> 01:12:11,284
[Batman] I do, uh...

1674
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:13,489
- Emmet!

What's happening?
What did I just do?

- [rumbling]
- [gasps]

1680
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:39,682
Lucy!

1681
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:43,349
- Come with me.
- I got you, brother.

1682
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,785
- [Wyldstyle] Wait!
- [chirps]

<i>Where am I? What...</i>

1689
01:13:11,479 --> 01:13:13,814
You shouldn't take my stuff!

1690
01:13:13,816 --> 01:13:17,717
[Bianca] You crushed
my space laser cake thingy!

[Wyldstyle] <i>Emmet?</i>

1692
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:24,056
Rex, why are we leaving?

1693
01:13:24,058 --> 01:13:25,792
We gotta save my friends.

1694
01:13:25,794 --> 01:13:28,528
Do we? They didn't come to
save us when we were all alone.

1695
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:31,463
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

1696
01:13:31,465 --> 01:13:33,600
Look a little closer.
We're not so different.

1697
01:13:33,602 --> 01:13:34,534
What, you and I?

1698
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,269
- We and us.
- Huh?

1699
01:13:36,271 --> 01:13:38,704
Emmet, I'm you.

1700
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,239
But I'm me.

1701
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:43,743
I'm you from the future,
all grown up.

1702
01:13:43,745 --> 01:13:47,713
Wait, if you're me,
why do we sound so different?

1703
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,516
[in Emmet's voice]
Why do we sound so different?

1704

[gasps]

1705
01:13:50,986 --> 01:13:52,519
It's a mind-blower, I know.

1706
01:13:52,521 --> 01:13:55,221
That's why I was so cagey
in telling you my backstory.

1707
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:56,690
Actually, you kept
bringing it up.

1708
01:13:56,692 --> 01:13:58,925
There I was, you.

1713
01:14:07,436 --> 01:14:11,037
[Rex] <i>There was no handsome,
older version of myself to save me.</i>

1714
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:12,571
[Finn] Where's Emmet?

1715
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,773
[The Man Upstairs] Honey,
I'm on my way out the door,

1716
01:14:13,775 --> 01:14:15,475
but the kids are fighting.
Bye!

1717
01:14:15,477 --> 01:14:18,011
[Mom] Guys! Please,
find a way to play together,

1718
01:14:18,013 --> 01:14:20,379
or I'm gonna have to ask you
to put it all into storage.

1719
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:21,948
- [Bianca] But, Mom...
- [Mom] No buts.

1720
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:24,284
This is the last time.

1721
01:14:24,286 --> 01:14:26,388
[Emmet] <i>Help! Anyone?</i>

1722
01:14:26,988 --> 01:14:28,520
<i>Hello?</i>

1723
01:14:28,522 --> 01:14:31,190
[Rex] <i>No one heard me.
No one came for me.</i>

1724
01:14:31,192 --> 01:14:33,392
<i>I was left behind. Forgotten.</i>

1725
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:36,596
<i>While the rest of my so-called
friends danced and sang</i>

1726
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:39,268
<i>at the hands of a monster.</i>

1727
01:14:42,004 --> 01:14:45,739
<i>What could I have done
to avoid such a fate?</i>

1728
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:48,374
[Wyldstyle] <i>We also have
to grow up sometime.</i>

1729
01:14:48,376 --> 01:14:51,677
[Abraham Lincoln] <i>Wyldstyle said
you're not tough enough to do this.</i>

1730
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,213
[General Mayhem]
<i>This guy was a fierce warrior?</i>

1731
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:57,150
[Surfer Dave] <i>Yeah, dude,
you're a total Hufflepuff.</i>

1733
01:14:59,321 --> 01:15:03,056
[Rex] <i>I was alone with nothing</i>

1734
01:15:03,058 --> 01:15:04,524
<i>but anger.</i>

1735
01:15:04,526 --> 01:15:07,560
<i>But anger was the key
to my freedom.</i>

1736
01:15:07,562 --> 01:15:09,597
[yelling]

1737
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:13,699
[grunting]

1738
01:15:13,701 --> 01:15:19,474
<i>It was time for me
to take a stand.</i>

[grunting]

1740
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:25,745
<i>I was real.</i>

1741
01:15:25,747 --> 01:15:28,817
<i>I was no longer the
naive Emmet I used to be.</i>

1742
01:15:31,452 --> 01:15:34,820
<i>I got myself a new vest,
a new head of hair,</i>

1743
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:38,824
<i>and a petulant attitude
towards everything that's lame.</i>

1744
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,528
<i>I gave myself a makeover
and became Rex.</i>

1745
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:44,497
[announcer]
<i>Radical Emmet Xtreme.</i>

1746
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:48,836
[Rex] <i>I was all grown up,
but I still wasn't free.</i>

1747
01:15:51,539 --> 01:15:53,774
<i>I knew the only way
to move past it</i>

1748
01:15:53,776 --> 01:15:56,677
<i>was to make sure it never
happened in the first place.</i>

1749
01:15:56,679 --> 01:15:58,211
[Bianca] It's a dance party!

1750
01:15:58,213 --> 01:15:59,812
[Rex] <i>And then I saw a way</i>

1751
01:15:59,814 --> 01:16:03,382
<i>to undo all the unbearable
pain I'd experienced</i>

1752
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:06,319
<i>in one convoluted move...</i>

1753
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:08,620
<i>Called time travel.</i>

1754
01:16:08,622 --> 01:16:10,823
Sorry, Doc,
gonna need your DeLorean.

1755
01:16:10,825 --> 01:16:13,426
And, Bill, Ted,
your phone booth.

1756
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:15,494
Doctor Who's TARDIS.
H.G. Wells' bicycle thing.

1757
01:16:15,496 --> 01:16:16,796
Whatever Skynet's been using.

1758
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:18,398
And this hot tub.

1759
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,065
<i>I built a time-traveling
spaceship</i>

1760
01:16:20,067 --> 01:16:22,303
- <i>and blasted into the past.</i>
- [electricity crackling]

1761
01:16:25,473 --> 01:16:27,009
- <i>I picked up a crew.</i>
- [raptors screeching]

1762
01:16:30,946 --> 01:16:32,878
[Rex] <i>Then I traveled
to the moment right before</i>

1763
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,019
<i>I was thrown into the cold,
dark truth of the world.</i>

1764
01:16:43,892 --> 01:16:47,496
<i>And I found the one person
I wanted to protect.</i>

1765
01:16:49,365 --> 01:16:50,599
- Whoa!
- [Rex] <i>Me.</i>

1766
01:16:52,968 --> 01:16:55,034
I was following everything you
said, except for...

1767
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:58,473
Everything after the part
where you said, "I'm you."

1768
01:16:59,773 --> 01:17:01,977
Literally the first thing
I said.

1769
01:17:03,445 --> 01:17:05,477
This time travel stuff's
always kinda confusing.

1770
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:06,779
It's best just to go with it.

1771
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:08,715
You tricked me
into hurting my friends?

1772
01:17:08,717 --> 01:17:12,517
I didn't trick you.
I taught you to harden your heart,

1773
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:14,287
just like you asked me to.

1774
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:16,155
What did you make me do?

1775
01:17:16,157 --> 01:17:19,592
What exactly is Armamageddon?

1776
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:23,229
- [indistinct arguing]
- [Finn] You stole my guys.

1777
01:17:23,231 --> 01:17:24,364
This is your fault.

1778
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:25,798
What's going on up here?

1779
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,900
[Finn] She took my guys
and she ruined them.

1780
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:30,102
- [both arguing]
- All right, all right!

1781
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,404
[Wyldstyle] <i>Armamageddon.</i>

1782
01:17:32,406 --> 01:17:35,208
<i>Our-mama-gets-in?</i>

1783
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,177
<i>Okay. Really?</i>

1784
01:17:37,179 --> 01:17:39,011
[exclaiming] Guys.

1785
01:17:39,013 --> 01:17:42,114
I know I said it was the last
time, the last time,

1786
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,050
and the time before that.

1787
01:17:44,052 --> 01:17:46,252
But this is the last...

1788
01:17:46,254 --> 01:17:47,488
Last time.

1789
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,088
I need... [screams]

1790
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,459
I stepped on a brick.

1791
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:54,327
[breathes deeply] I'm just...

1792
01:17:54,329 --> 01:17:58,330
I'm doing breathing,
so that it takes the pain away.

1793
01:17:58,332 --> 01:18:00,533
I need... [screaming]

1794
01:18:00,535 --> 01:18:02,968
[groaning]

1795
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,270
Close to childbirth.

1796
01:18:05,272 --> 01:18:08,775
Very close in pain level to childbirth.
[inhales deeply]

1797
01:18:08,777 --> 01:18:10,577
You guys
know the consequences.

1798
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:12,878
I need you guys to put
all the bricks into storage.

- No, no, no, Mom, please.
- Please, please. One more chance.

1801
01:18:16,584 --> 01:18:18,484
Finn, I want you
to go downstairs

1802
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,754
and put away your
dystopian wasteland thing.

1803
01:18:21,756 --> 01:18:24,457
- It's Apocalypseburg.
- I don't care what it's called.

1804
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:26,458
Bianca, I need you
to clean up here.

1805
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,927
Mom, it's not fair.

1806
01:18:27,929 --> 01:18:29,562
[Mom] Look, I'm not
the bad guy in this story.

1807
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:31,297
I'm just an amusing
side character.

1808
01:18:31,299 --> 01:18:32,931
- And you're the one who took my guys.
- How is it my fault?

1809
01:18:32,933 --> 01:18:35,066
[Mom] Hon, I could really
use your help up here.

1810
01:18:35,068 --> 01:18:38,404
[The Man Upstairs] Kids, do the thing...
Uh, what your mother said.

1811
01:18:38,406 --> 01:18:41,009
You heard your father's
super helpful contribution.

1812
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:44,176
[sighs]

1813
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,044
You ruined everything.

1814
01:18:46,046 --> 01:18:48,483
I just wanted you
to play with me.

1815
01:18:54,889 --> 01:18:59,093
[Wyldstyle]
<i>Emmet, what have you done?</i>

1816
01:19:01,129 --> 01:19:02,529
What have we done?

1817
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:04,196
[Rex] It's called growing up.

1818
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,431
Isn't that what you wanted?

1819
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:07,300
No. I wanna save my friends.

1820
01:19:07,302 --> 01:19:10,569
You don't have friends.
They're just pieces of plastic.

1821
01:19:10,571 --> 01:19:12,305
[chuckles] You still want to
go back

1822
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:14,306
- to the Matrix when you know the truth?
- What's the Matrix?

1823
01:19:14,308 --> 01:19:17,476
It's a movie only cool, older,
mature dudes like us have seen.

1824
01:19:17,478 --> 01:19:20,212
It's time to put away
childish things.

1825
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,948
No.

1826
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:23,681
My friends may not be real to
you, but they're real to me.

1827
01:19:23,683 --> 01:19:25,351
And they're my family.

1828
01:19:25,353 --> 01:19:26,722
I won't give up on 'em.

1829
01:19:30,692 --> 01:19:34,392
I am so disappointed
in myself.

1830
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:37,529
I guess you're gonna have
to become me the hard way.

1831
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:39,466
Ain't something

01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:26,399
This isn't the end!
It can't be.

1864
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:28,534
This isn't one of those things
with a downer cliffhanger ending.

1865
01:22:28,536 --> 01:22:31,337
Uh-uh. No, no.
This needs to have a happy ending.

1866
01:22:31,339 --> 01:22:33,138
Seems like a downer to me.

1867
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:36,508
And so it ends for Batman,

It's no rush or anything.

1871
01:22:41,782 --> 01:22:44,284
No! No, no, no!
It's only over if we give up.

1872
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:46,052
Well, it's over
and we're giving up.

No. It's too late.
