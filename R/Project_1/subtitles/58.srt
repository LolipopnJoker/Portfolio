1
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,588
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

2
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:30,802
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:41,510
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,216
The dark fire will not
avail you, flame of Udun!

5
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:54,583
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,415
No! No!

7
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,591
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,928
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:37,433
No!

10
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,464
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,973
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,207
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,877
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:08,216
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,599
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,002
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,982
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,062
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,394
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,797
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,205
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,373
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,809
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,217
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,986
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,854
You never know.

27
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:20,262
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,901
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,161
It is special.

30
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,942
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,682
We can't leave this here for
someone to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:44,642
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:49,322
It's a shame, really. Lady
Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,960
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,263
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,399
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,402
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:27,052
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,424
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,928
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,337
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:41,438
I don't think Gandalf meant
for us to come this way.

43
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,377
He didn't mean for a lot of
things to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,716
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,762
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,100
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,671
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,048
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,847
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,788
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,493
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,210
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,403
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:57,740
Nothing ever dampens your
spirits, does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,855
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,924
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,021
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,759
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,367
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,733
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,841
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,107
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,784
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:23,527
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:27,661
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,501
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:33,372
Where is it?

68
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,276
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:41,681
My precious.

70
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,819
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:50,087
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:46,980
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,675
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,354
haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:58,918
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,708
It burns!

77
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,211
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,151
It freezes!

79
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,218
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,051
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:36,728
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,494
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,261
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,136
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:49,869
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:55,718
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:04,024
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:07,025
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:14,069
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:16,171
We swears.

91
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,907
There's no promise you can
make that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,339
We swears...

93
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:28,345
to serve the master of the precious.

94
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,317
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:34,456
on the precious.

96
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,818
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:41,122
The Ring is treacherous. It
will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,295
Yes...

99
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,357
on the precious.

100
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:51,171
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:53,831
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,336
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:01,277
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,442
If we let him go, he'll
throttle us in our sleep.

105
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:20,392
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,067
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,666
Yes.

108
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,214
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:53,665
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:58,636
No! We won't go back. Not there.
Not to him.

111
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:03,038
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,680
But we swore to serve the
master of the precious.

113
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:12,842
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,888
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:21,188
And always the Great Eye
watching, watching.

116
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,964
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,600
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,003
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,699
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,469
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,771
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,028
Merry!

123
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,488
Merry!

124
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,771
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,772
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:16,241
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,344
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,717
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,294
Merry!

130
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,794
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,134
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,234
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,944
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,843
Stop it!

135
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,681
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,918
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,827
You want some?

138
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,931
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,363
Merry.

140
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,764
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,045
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,704
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,250
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,684
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,983
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,258
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,764
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:44,994
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,535
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,621
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,601
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,532
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,937
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,078
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,218
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:38,377
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,983
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

158
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,690
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,156
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:25,257
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:29,735
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,539
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,017
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,987
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:53,753
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,899
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,035
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:08,108
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,837
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,842
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,979
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:27,590
The world is changing.

173
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:33,360
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

174
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,800
and Mordor?

175
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:44,138
To stand against the might
of Sauron and Saruman...

176
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:47,941
and the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:57,425
Together, my Lord Sauron...

178
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:01,119
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:21,478
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

180
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,315
The forests will fall.

181
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:30,089
A new order will rise.

182
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,062
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

183
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:40,190
and the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,944
I want them armed and ready
to march within two weeks!

185
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,743
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,944
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

187
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:04,181
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:07,191
We don't have enough
fuel to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:12,828
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:16,600
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:19,635
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,775
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:37,053
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:40,149
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,855
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:46,465
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,493
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:51,465
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:59,838
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

200
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,838
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,110
Too long have these
peasants stood against you.

202
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,083
But no more.

203
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,519
Eothain! Eothain!

204
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,355
You take your sister. You'll
go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,391
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,226
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:24,403
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,095
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:30,307
I don't want to leave. I
don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:34,207
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:40,813
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:48,784
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,573
Rohan, my lord...

214
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:06,772
is ready to fall.

215
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,547
Theodred.

216
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,385
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:43,873
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,616
My Lord Eomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:58,224
He's alive.

220
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,119
Theodred.

221
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:47,534
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,436
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:55,611
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:58,476
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,491
Saruman the White has ever
been our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,154
Grima.

227
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,534
Grima.

228
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,561
Grima.

229
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,433
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

230
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:24,438
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:28,015
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:41,626
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,299
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:49,495
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:52,231
your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,412
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,740
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,947
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:05,779
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,894
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,071
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:35,480
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

243
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,810
Too much.

244
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:43,955
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:48,927
and all its domains under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,730
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,368
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:58,737
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:01,068
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:04,269
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:35,843 --> 00:27:38,539
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:40,474
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:48,419
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:06,597
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,764
until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,277
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:16,906
Merry!

258
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,614
Merry!

259
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,519
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,196
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,238
It's the trees.

262
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:42,032
What?

263
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,209
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:50,873
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,574
and come alive.

266
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,514
Alive?

267
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,083
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:00,559
talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:02,524
even move.

270
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,394
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:10,626
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

272
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,265
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:15,736
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,305
What about them?

275
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,379
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:26,814
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,759
What about their legs?

278
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,258
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,927
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:48,638
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,941
Alive?

282
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:58,178
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:03,953
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:07,148
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:11,927
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,530
As soon as they find out
we don't, we're dead.

287
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,368
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:19,730
a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:30,105
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

290
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:37,983
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,850
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,789
Go on.

293
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,468
Call for help.

294
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,962
Squeal.

295
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,334
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:07,916
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,699
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,146
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:11,177
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:14,048
what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,213
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,277
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:53,281
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,956
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,767
if it stood but a little
higher from the ground.

306
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,863
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,481
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:26,014
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:29,418
We are friends of Rohan and
of Theoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,925
Theoden no longer
recognizes friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,358
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,837
Saruman has poisoned the
mind of the king...

313
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,939
and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,901
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:52,841
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,215
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:01,286
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,423
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,125
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,527
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,634
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:17,268
They have taken two of our friends captive.

323
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,540
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,871
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,013
They would be small. Only
children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,341
We left none alive.

327
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,955
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:42,656
Dead?

329
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:47,360
I am sorry.

330
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,237
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:01,707
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,508
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,953
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,655
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,923
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:21,123
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,548
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,500
Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace after death.)

339
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,391
We failed them.

340
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,609
A Hobbit lay here.

341
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,145
And the other.

342
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,556
They crawled.

343
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,763
Their hands were bound.

344
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:21,748
Their bonds were cut.

345
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:39,361
They ran over here.

346
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:44,200
They were followed.

347
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:49,140
The belt!

348
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,176
Run!

349
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,252
Tracks lead away from the battle...

350
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:06,154
into Fangorn Forest.

351
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:08,497
Fangorn?

352
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,293
What madness drove them in there?

353
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:32,044
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

354
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:42,197
I'm going to rip out your
filthy little innards!

355
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:49,426
Come here!

356
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:57,504
Trees. Climb a tree.

357
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,551
He's gone.

358
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:22,968
Merry!

359
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,853
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

360
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,518
Run, Merry!

361
00:39:57,305 --> 00:40:01,639
Little Orcs.

362
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,142
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

363
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:06,212
Tree?

364
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,373
I am no tree!

365
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,778
I am an Ent.

366
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,480
A tree-herder.

367
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:17,024
A shepherd of the forest.

368
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:18,557
Don't talk to it, Merry.

369
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,527
Don't encourage it!

370
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:24,960
Treebeard, some call me.

371
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,101
And whose side are you on?

372
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:29,329
Side?

373
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:32,404
I am on nobody's side...

374
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:38,110
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

375
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:43,543
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

376
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:46,351
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

377
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,818
Hobbits?

378
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:54,926
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

379
00:40:56,129 --> 00:41:00,623
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

380
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,928
They come with fire.

381
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:05,696
They come with axes.

382
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:10,707
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

383
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:14,711
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

384
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,781
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

385
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:19,782
Halflings!

386
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,045
Shire-folk!

387
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:23,587
Maybe you are...

388
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:27,520
and maybe you aren't.

389
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:32,531
The White Wizard will know.

390
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,267
The White Wizard?

391
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:38,293
Saruman.

392
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,544
See? See?

393
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:55,185
We've led you out.

394
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:57,845
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

395
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,428
Very lucky we find you.

396
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,831
Nice Hobbit.

397
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,005
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

398
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:20,805
A swamp, yes, yes.

399
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,279
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

400
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:32,057
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

401
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,956
I found it. I did.

402
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,826
The way through the marshes.

403
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:44,525
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

404
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:48,798
They go around for miles and miles.

405
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,441
Come quickly.

406
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:54,703
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

407
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,213
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

408
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:01,648
There's been no sight nor
sound of a bird for two days.

409
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,187
No, no birdses to eat.

410
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:09,655
No crunchable birdses.

411
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:13,128
We are famished! Yes!

412
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:17,598
Famished we are, precious!

413
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,074
Here.

414
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:37,277
What does it eats?

415
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,457
Is it tasty?

416
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:47,357
It tries to chokes us!

417
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:51,295
We can't eats Hobbit food!

418
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:57,030
We must starve!

419
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:59,573
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

420
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,539
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

421
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:05,579
It does not care if we be hungry.

422
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:10,549
Does not care if we should die.

423
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:14,021
Not like master.

424
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:17,485
Master cares.

425
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:20,527
Master knows.

426
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,968
Yes.

427
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:27,763
Precious.

428
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:34,970
Once it takes hold of us...

429
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:41,011
it never lets go.

430
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:42,878
Don't touch me!

431
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:17,216
There are dead things!

432
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,149
Dead faces in the water.

433
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:27,952
All dead. All rotten.

434
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:32,230
Elves and Men and Orcses.

435
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:36,064
A great battle long ago.

436
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:38,602
Dead Marshes.

437
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:41,538
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

438
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:44,975
This way.

439
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:47,945
Don't follow the lights.

440
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:53,553
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

441
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:57,852
and light little candles of their own.

442
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:25,519
Frodo!

443
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,661
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

444
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,700
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

445
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,735
Are you all right?

446
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:50,604
So bright.

447
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:54,604
So beautiful.

448
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:58,643
Our precious.

449
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:01,604
What did you say?

450
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,976
Master should be resting.

451
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:08,211
Master needs to keep up his strength.

452
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:13,454
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

453
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,116
Gollum. Gollum.

454
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,092
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

455
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:21,359
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

456
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:23,092
He said your life was a sad story.

457
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:27,831
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

458
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:30,999
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

459
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,939
Were you?

460
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:37,411
Smeagol.

461
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,646
What did you call me?

462
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,756
That was your name once, wasn't it?

463
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,695
A long time ago.

464
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,693
My name.

465
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:57,258
My name.

466
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:06,611
Smeagol.

467
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,376
Black Riders!

468
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,882
Hide! Hide!

469
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,761
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

470
00:49:26,932 --> 00:49:30,561
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

471
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,998
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

472
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:37,141
No, you cannot kill them. No.

473
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,394
Wraiths!

474
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:07,799
Wraiths on wings!

475
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,838
They are calling for it.

476
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:21,609
They are calling for the precious.

477
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,881
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

478
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,318
I'm here.

479
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,864
Hurry, Hobbits.

480
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:49,379
The Black Gate is very close.

481
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,118
Orc blood.

482
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,828
These are strange tracks.

483
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,126
The air is so close in here.

484
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,704
This forest is old.

485
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,498
Very old.

486
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:23,575
Full of memory...

487
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:28,514
and anger.

488
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,592
The trees are speaking to each other.

489
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,250
Gimli!

490
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,363
Lower your ax.

491
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,931
They have feelings, my friend.

492
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,461
The Elves began it.

493
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:54,405
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

494
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,277
Talking trees.

495
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,940
What do trees have to talk about?

496
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,280
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

497
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,050
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
(Aragorn, something is out there!)

498
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Man cenich?
(What do you see?)

499
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,667
The White Wizard approaches.

500
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:31,175
Do not let him speak. He
will put a spell on us.

501
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:43,020
We must be quick.

502
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:02,236
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

503
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,210
Where are they?

504
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:07,940
They passed this way the
day before yesterday.

505
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:12,382
They met someone they did not expect.

506
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:14,681
Does that comfort you?

507
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:16,824
Who are you?

508
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:20,261
Show yourself!

509
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,161
It cannot be.

510
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:35,108
Forgive me.

511
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,711
I mistook you for Saruman.

512
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,244
I am Saruman.

513
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:47,652
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

514
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:50,113
You fell.

515
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:54,117
Through fire...

516
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:55,592
and water.

517
00:53:57,064 --> 00:53:59,589
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

518
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:03,464
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

519
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,050
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

520
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:26,682
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

521
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:35,259
Darkness took me...

522
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:40,097
and I strayed out of thought and time.

523
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:43,934
Stars wheeled overhead...

524
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,704
and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

525
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,977
But it was not the end.

526
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:56,052
I felt life in me again.

527
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,516
I've been sent back...

528
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:02,252
until my task is done.

529
00:55:02,629 --> 00:55:04,529
Gandalf.

530
00:55:05,198 --> 00:55:07,189
Gandalf?

531
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,397
Yes.

532
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,002
That was what they used to call me.

533
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:19,140
Gandalf the Grey.

534
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,243
That was my name.

535
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:23,848
Gandalf.

536
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:27,878
I am Gandalf the White.

537
00:55:30,923 --> 00:55:33,983
And I come back to you now...

538
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,650
at the turn of the tide.

539
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:40,732
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

540
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,663
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

541
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:47,629
That is no short distance!

542
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:51,137
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

543
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,403
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

544
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:57,015
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

545
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,173
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

546
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:03,515
in this horrid, dark,
dank tree-infested...?

547
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,288
I mean, charming...

548
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:12,191
quite charming forest.

549
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:16,394
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

550
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:20,971
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

551
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,576
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

552
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:28,076
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

553
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,239
I n one thing you have not
changed, dear friend.

554
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,010
You still speak in riddles.

555
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:44,260
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

556
00:56:44,428 --> 00:56:48,057
The Ents are going to wake up...

557
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,093
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

558
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,031
Oh, that's good.

559
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:57,935
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

560
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,273
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

561
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:05,040
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

562
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:08,947
This new Gandalf's more
grumpy than the old one.

563
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:32,675
That is one of the Mearas...

564
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,641
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

565
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:55,527
Shadowfax.

566
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,729
He is the lord of all horses...

567
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:06,240
and has been my friend
through many dangers.

568
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:24,085
O rowan mine

569
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:28,061
I saw you shine

570
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:31,758
Upon a summer's day

571
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:37,329
Upon your head How golden-red

572
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,272
The crown you bore aloft

573
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:44,844
Such a beautiful verse.

574
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:49,917
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

575
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:53,350
You might call it far, perhaps.

576
00:58:54,256 --> 00:58:58,056
My home lies deep in the forest...

577
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,162
near the roots of the mountain.

578
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:07,095
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

579
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:11,295
And safe is where I'll keep you.

580
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:15,942
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

581
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,337
It's one of my own compositions.

582
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,709
Right.

583
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:27,015
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

584
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:32,058
And the dreams of trees unfold

585
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:38,689
When woodland halls are green and cool

586
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:42,961
And the wind is in the West

587
00:59:43,438 --> 00:59:46,100
Come back to me

588
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:51,101
Come back to me

589
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:57,707
And say my land is best

590
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,822
Sleep, little Shirelings.

591
01:00:08,997 --> 01:00:12,592
Heed no nightly noise.

592
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,702
Sleep till morning light.

593
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:22,503
I have business in the forest.

594
01:00:22,677 --> 01:00:28,206
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

595
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:34,114
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

596
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:40,124
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

597
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:53,835
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

598
01:00:54,641 --> 01:00:57,235
Sauron will suffer no rival.

599
01:00:57,677 --> 01:01:01,943
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

600
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:05,482
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

601
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,488
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

602
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:11,215
The rumor has reached him.

603
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,360
The heir of Numenor still lives.

604
01:01:15,328 --> 01:01:18,161
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

605
01:01:19,499 --> 01:01:21,660
He fears what you may become.

606
01:01:22,936 --> 01:01:26,372
And so he'll strike hard and
fast at the world of Men.

607
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,169
He will use his puppet
Saruman to destroy Rohan.

608
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:31,833
War is coming.

609
01:01:32,012 --> 01:01:35,573
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

610
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:38,183
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

611
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:42,048
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

612
01:01:42,222 --> 01:01:45,316
His hold over King Theoden
is now very strong.

613
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:50,190
Sauron and Saruman are
tightening the noose.

614
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,157
But for all their cunning...

615
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:55,890
we have one advantage.

616
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,630
The Ring remains hidden.

617
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,574
And that we should seek to destroy it...

618
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,711
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

619
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:10,612
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

620
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:12,273
in the hands of a Hobbit.

621
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:16,547
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

622
01:02:16,722 --> 01:02:19,350
We must trust now in Frodo.

623
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:21,356
Everything depends upon speed...

624
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,519
and the secrecy of his quest.

625
01:02:26,499 --> 01:02:29,832
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

626
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:33,467
Frodo must finish this task alone.

627
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:36,538
He's not alone.

628
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,404
Sam went with him.

629
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:40,272
Did he?

630
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:45,076
Did he, indeed? Good.

631
01:02:45,684 --> 01:02:48,118
Yes, very good.

632
01:02:56,127 --> 01:03:01,030
The Black Gate of Mordor.

633
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:06,236
Oh, save us.

634
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:15,274
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

635
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:21,975
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

636
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:25,589
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

637
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:26,985
I did.

638
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:37,758
That's it, then.

639
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:40,634
We can't get past that.

640
01:04:25,816 --> 01:04:27,147
Look!

641
01:04:27,317 --> 01:04:28,784
The gate.

642
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:30,146
It's opening!

643
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:39,562
I can see a way down.

644
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:42,390
Sam, no!

645
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:45,966
Master!

646
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:13,278
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

647
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:17,218
I doubt even these Elvish
cloaks will hide us in there.

648
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:19,524
- Now!
- No!

649
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:22,063
No! No, master!

650
01:06:22,263 --> 01:06:25,232
They catch you! They catch you!

651
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:29,094
Don't take it to him.

652
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,770
He wants the precious.

653
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:37,969
Always he is looking for it.

654
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:42,048
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

655
01:06:42,283 --> 01:06:46,185
But we mustn't let him have it.

656
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:54,687
No! There's another way.

657
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:57,558
More secret. A dark way.

658
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:01,529
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

659
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:03,026
He's up to something.

660
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:06,231
Are you saying there's
another way into Mordor?

661
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:09,137
Yes. There's a path...

662
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:11,800
and some stairs.

663
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,673
And then...

664
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:17,180
a tunnel.

665
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:32,995
He's led us this far, Sam.

666
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,566
Mr. Frodo, no.

667
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:37,169
He's been true to his word.

668
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:43,236
No.

669
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:47,006
Lead the way, Smeagol.

670
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:51,550
Good Smeagol always helps.

671
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,507
Hello?

672
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:30,980
Treebeard?

673
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,022
Where has he gone?

674
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:35,660
I had the loveliest dream last night.

675
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,991
There was this large
barrel, full of pipe-weed.

676
01:08:39,165 --> 01:08:41,656
And we smoked all of it. And then...

677
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,102
you were sick.

678
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,538
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

679
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,978
Did you hear that?

680
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,452
There it is again.

681
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,985
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

682
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:14,731
You just said something... Treeish.

683
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,893
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

684
01:09:26,444 --> 01:09:28,309
You're taller.

685
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:30,337
- Who?
- You!

686
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:32,142
- Than what?
- Than me!

687
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,778
I've always been taller than you.

688
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:39,583
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

689
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,948
Please, Merry.

690
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,994
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

691
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:49,398
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

692
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:53,800
3'8"!

693
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,571
Three-foot-eight.

694
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:02,545
You did something.

695
01:10:08,353 --> 01:10:09,945
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

696
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:12,355
Merry!

697
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:14,888
No, Treebeard said that
you shouldn't have any.

698
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:18,961
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

699
01:10:19,129 --> 01:10:21,290
Give me it back. Merry!

700
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:24,498
What's happening?!

701
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:26,836
It's got my leg!

702
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,661
Merry!

703
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,650
Help!

704
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:58,298
Away with you.

705
01:10:58,469 --> 01:11:00,266
You should not be waking.

706
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:05,640
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

707
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:08,803
Go to sleep.

708
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:11,011
Away with you.

709
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:14,480
Come, the forest is waking up.

710
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:16,985
It isn't safe.

711
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:23,592
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

712
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,752
Anger festers in their hearts.

713
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,257
Black are their thoughts.

714
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,957
Strong is their hate.

715
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:34,899
They will harm you if they can.

716
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:38,632
There are too few of us now.

717
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:42,801
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

718
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:46,074
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

719
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:49,446
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

720
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:55,251
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

721
01:11:55,458 --> 01:12:00,691
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

722
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,362
Oh, I'm sorry.

723
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:06,401
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

724
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:09,800
We lost them.

725
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:15,035
And now we cannot find them.

726
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:21,445
I don't suppose you've seen
Entwives in the Shire?

727
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,398
Can't say that I have.

728
01:12:24,942 --> 01:12:26,967
You, Pip?

729
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,845
What do they look like?

730
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:37,947
I don't remember now.

731
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:58,273
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

732
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,670
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

733
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:05,246
whose mind is overthrown.

734
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:09,681
Saruman's hold over King
Theoden is now very strong.

735
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,483
My lord, your son...

736
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:15,852
he is dead.

737
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,158
My lord?

738
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,590
Uncle?

739
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,668
Will you not go to him?

740
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,209
Will you do nothing?

741
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,347
Be careful what you say.

742
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,708
Do not look for welcome here.

743
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,904
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

744
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,238
What a tragedy for the king...

745
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,449
to lose his only son and heir.

746
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:20,079
I understand. His passing
is hard to accept.

747
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:25,158
Especially now that your
brother has deserted you.

748
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:26,793
Leave me alone, snake!

749
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,890
Oh, but you are alone.

750
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:36,300
Who knows what you've
spoken to the darkness...

751
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:39,929
in the bitter watches of the night...

752
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,771
when all your life seems to shrink.

753
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:48,176
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

754
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:52,911
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

755
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:57,056
So fair.

756
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,691
So cold.

757
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,624
Like a morning of pale spring...

758
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,268
still clinging to winter's chill.

759
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,540
Your words are poison.

760
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:58,576
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

761
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:16,725
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

762
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:20,791
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

763
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:39,912
Your staff.

764
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:46,813
You would not part an old
man from his walking stick.

765
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:08,477
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

766
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:18,346
He's a herald of woe.

767
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:22,960
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

768
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:25,495
Theoden King.

769
01:18:26,197 --> 01:18:28,722
He's not welcome.

770
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:35,004
Why should I welcome you...

771
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:39,169
Gandalf Stormcrow?

772
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:42,642
A just question, my liege.

773
01:18:42,813 --> 01:18:45,680
Late is the hour...

774
01:18:45,849 --> 01:18:49,808
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

775
01:18:50,621 --> 01:18:52,680
Lathspell I name him.

776
01:18:52,856 --> 01:18:55,757
Ill news is an ill guest.

777
01:18:55,926 --> 01:19:00,488
Be silent. Keep your forked
tongue behind your teeth.

778
01:19:00,664 --> 01:19:02,598
I have not passed through fire and death...

779
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,931
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

780
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:09,030
His staff.

781
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:13,369
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

782
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:18,648
Theoden...

783
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:21,776
son of Thengel...

784
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:25,920
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

785
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:32,157
I would stay still if I were you.

786
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:34,422
Hearken to me!

787
01:19:39,937 --> 01:19:42,063
I release you...

788
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:44,239
from the spell.

789
01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:58,811
You have no power here...

790
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:02,617
Gandalf the Grey.

791
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:13,093
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

792
01:20:22,545 --> 01:20:24,069
Wait.

793
01:20:25,515 --> 01:20:29,349
If I go, Theoden dies.

794
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:32,247
You did not kill me...

795
01:20:32,422 --> 01:20:34,617
you will not kill him.

796
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,223
Rohan is mine.

797
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:43,028
Be gone.

798
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,669
I know your face.

799
01:21:34,249 --> 01:21:35,511
Eowyn.

800
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:39,081
Eowyn.

801
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,555
Gandalf?

802
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,963
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

803
01:22:05,312 --> 01:22:07,906
Dark have been my dreams of late.

804
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:15,818
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

805
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,959
if they grasped your sword.

806
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,038
I've only...

807
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,299
ever served you, my lord.

808
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:14,469
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

809
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:17,415
Send me not from your sight.

810
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:22,449
No, my lord! No, my lord.

811
01:23:22,655 --> 01:23:23,849
Let him go.

812
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:27,788
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

813
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:39,268
Get out of my way!

814
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:44,670
Hail, Theoden King!

815
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:11,758
Where is Theodred?

816
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:17,366
Where is my son?

817
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:10,126
"Bealocwealm hafað fréone
frecan forth onsended...

818
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:14,400
("An evil death has set
forth the noble warrior...)

819
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:18,688
...giedd sculon singan
gléomenn sorgiende."

820
01:25:18,701 --> 01:25:21,950
(...A song shall sing
sorrowing minstrels.")

821
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:25,000
"On Meduselde...
("In Meduseld...)

822
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,600
...þæt he ma no wære...
(...that he is no more...)

823
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,100
...is þurh niedig rest."
(...for his necessary rest.")

824
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:37,500
"And mægen deorost...
(And that he is the dearest kinsman...)

825
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,300
...bealo..."
(...killing took him...")

826
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,291
Simbelmyn?

827
01:25:51,469 --> 01:25:55,064
Ever has it grown on the
tombs of my forbearers.

828
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:01,877
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

829
01:26:03,947 --> 01:26:07,815
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

830
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:12,988
The young perish and the old linger.

831
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,683
That I should live...

832
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:19,226
to see the last days of my house.

833
01:26:20,497 --> 01:26:24,365
Theodred's death was not of your making.

834
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:30,804
No parent should have to bury their child.

835
01:26:47,524 --> 01:26:49,389
He was strong in life.

836
01:26:50,493 --> 01:26:54,054
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

837
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,500
"Westu hál."
("Be thou well.")

838
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,250
"Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu."
("Go thou, Théodred, go thou.)

839
01:27:38,674 --> 01:27:40,574
They had no warning.

840
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:43,142
They were unarmed.

841
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:47,639
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

842
01:27:48,584 --> 01:27:50,552
Rick, cot and tree.

843
01:27:50,853 --> 01:27:53,083
Where is Mama?

844
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:58,088
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

845
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:02,627
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

846
01:28:04,233 --> 01:28:07,201
Ride out and meet him head on.

847
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:11,461
Draw him away from your women and children.

848
01:28:11,806 --> 01:28:13,433
You must fight.

849
01:28:13,608 --> 01:28:17,442
You have 2000 good men
riding north as we speak.

850
01:28:17,612 --> 01:28:19,239
Eomer is loyal to you.

851
01:28:19,413 --> 01:28:22,109
His men will return and
fight for their king.

852
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:26,185
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

853
01:28:29,857 --> 01:28:32,087
Eomer cannot help us.

854
01:28:32,727 --> 01:28:34,490
I know what it is you want of me...

855
01:28:34,695 --> 01:28:37,960
but I will not bring further
death to my people.

856
01:28:39,634 --> 01:28:41,329
I will not risk open war.

857
01:28:43,537 --> 01:28:46,904
Open war is upon you, whether
you would risk it or not.

858
01:28:51,178 --> 01:28:52,805
When last I looked...

859
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:56,876
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

860
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:05,955
Then what is the king's decision?

861
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:12,895
By order of the king...

862
01:29:13,066 --> 01:29:14,533
the city must empty.

863
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:18,569
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

864
01:29:18,872 --> 01:29:22,774
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

865
01:29:22,976 --> 01:29:24,466
Helm's Deep.

866
01:29:24,644 --> 01:29:28,171
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

867
01:29:28,348 --> 01:29:30,316
Who will defend them if not their king?

868
01:29:30,483 --> 01:29:32,951
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

869
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:34,916
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

870
01:29:35,088 --> 01:29:38,990
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

871
01:29:39,192 --> 01:29:41,353
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

872
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:43,688
What they will get is a massacre.

873
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:47,733
Theoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

874
01:29:48,635 --> 01:29:51,968
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

875
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:55,306
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

876
01:29:55,775 --> 01:29:58,573
The people of Rohan will need you.

877
01:29:58,945 --> 01:30:01,413
The defenses have to hold.

878
01:30:02,849 --> 01:30:04,578
They will hold.

879
01:30:08,588 --> 01:30:10,886
The Grey Pilgrim.

880
01:30:11,057 --> 01:30:13,684
That's what they used to call me.

881
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:18,955
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

882
01:30:20,599 --> 01:30:22,794
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

883
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,634
Look to my coming at first
light on the fifth day.

884
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,202
At dawn, look to the east.

885
01:30:30,376 --> 01:30:31,934
Go.

886
01:30:59,271 --> 01:31:02,604
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

887
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,050
Fæste...
(Fast...)

888
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,200
...stille nú.
(...quiet now.)

889
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:12,500
Fæste...
(Fast...)

890
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,200
Stille...
(Quiet...)

891
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,300
...stille...
(...quiet...)

892
01:31:22,775 --> 01:31:23,975
...stille...
(...quiet...)

893
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,200
...stille...
(...quiet...)

894
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,750
Lac is drefed, gefrægon.
(A battle is stirring, you heard.)

895
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,000
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?)

896
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:41,500
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?)

897
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:43,705
His name is Brego.

898
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:47,116
He was my cousin's horse.

899
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:49,148
Brego.

900
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,800
Ðin nama is cynglic.
(Your name is kingly.)

901
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:56,000
Man le trasta, Brego?
(What troubles you, Brego?)

902
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,900
Man cenich?
(What did you see?)

903
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:06,268
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

904
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:09,736
but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

905
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,209
You speak as one of their own.

906
01:32:15,012 --> 01:32:17,446
I was raised in Rivendell...

907
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:19,238
for a time.

908
01:32:22,552 --> 01:32:24,577
Turn this fellow free.

909
01:32:25,255 --> 01:32:27,723
He's seen enough of war.

910
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:42,370
Gandalf the White.

911
01:32:42,539 --> 01:32:44,905
Gandalf the Fool!

912
01:32:46,176 --> 01:32:50,237
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

913
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:55,417
There were three who followed the wizard.

914
01:32:55,819 --> 01:33:01,189
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

915
01:33:01,558 --> 01:33:04,288
You stink of horse.

916
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:11,431
The Man...

917
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:17,668
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

918
01:33:17,841 --> 01:33:21,640
One of the Dunedain
Rangers, I thought he was.

919
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,607
His cloth was poor.

920
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:29,644
And yet he bore a strange ring.

921
01:33:30,753 --> 01:33:34,280
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

922
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:40,326
One devouring, the other
crowned with golden flowers.

923
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:42,396
The Ring of Barahir.

924
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:46,960
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks
he has found Isildur's heir.

925
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,469
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

926
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,369
The line was broken years ago.

927
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:56,267
It matters not.

928
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:58,970
The world of Men shall fall.

929
01:33:59,148 --> 01:34:01,013
It will begin at Edoras.

930
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:12,126
I am ready, Gamling.

931
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:14,762
Bring my horse.

932
01:34:17,933 --> 01:34:19,298
This is not a defeat.

933
01:34:21,704 --> 01:34:22,932
We will return.

934
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:30,776
We will return.

935
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:56,136
You have some skill with a blade.

936
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:06,672
Women of this country learned long ago:

937
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,476
Those without swords can
still die upon them.

938
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:11,482
I fear neither death nor pain.

939
01:35:12,754 --> 01:35:14,847
What do you fear, my lady?

940
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:20,090
A cage.

941
01:35:21,396 --> 01:35:25,230
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

942
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:29,301
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

943
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:34,764
You're a daughter of kings...

944
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:39,342
a shield maiden of Rohan.

945
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:47,142
I do not think that would be your fate.

946
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,212
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

947
01:36:23,423 --> 01:36:25,482
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

948
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:28,593
He will expect an attack on the city.

949
01:36:29,896 --> 01:36:33,160
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

950
01:36:33,332 --> 01:36:35,664
the great fortress of Rohan.

951
01:36:36,869 --> 01:36:41,272
It is a dangerous road to
take through the mountains.

952
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,437
They will be slow.

953
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,247
They will have women and
children with them.

954
01:36:53,152 --> 01:36:55,382
Send out your Warg-riders.

955
01:37:10,236 --> 01:37:13,137
Hey, stinker, don't go
getting too far ahead.

956
01:37:13,305 --> 01:37:15,967
- Why do you do that?
- What?

957
01:37:16,142 --> 01:37:18,667
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

958
01:37:19,111 --> 01:37:21,136
Because.

959
01:37:22,681 --> 01:37:24,808
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

960
01:37:25,017 --> 01:37:27,178
There's naught left in
him but lies and deceit.

961
01:37:27,653 --> 01:37:30,417
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

962
01:37:30,589 --> 01:37:32,853
You have no idea what it did to him...

963
01:37:33,025 --> 01:37:35,492
what it's still doing to him.

964
01:37:37,729 --> 01:37:39,822
I want to help him, Sam.

965
01:37:39,998 --> 01:37:41,260
Why?

966
01:37:46,571 --> 01:37:49,699
Because I have to believe he can come back.

967
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:55,879
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

968
01:37:56,047 --> 01:37:58,777
What do you know about it? Nothing!

969
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:09,888
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't
know why I said that.

970
01:38:10,728 --> 01:38:11,854
I do.

971
01:38:13,898 --> 01:38:15,763
It's the Ring.

972
01:38:16,334 --> 01:38:17,892
You can't take your eyes off it.

973
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:20,604
I've seen you.

974
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:24,906
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

975
01:38:26,678 --> 01:38:28,908
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

976
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,776
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

977
01:38:31,983 --> 01:38:34,918
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

978
01:38:35,086 --> 01:38:36,781
Mine! My own!

979
01:38:37,654 --> 01:38:39,747
Can't you hear yourself?

980
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:41,618
Don't you know who you sound like?

981
01:38:51,902 --> 01:38:54,029
We wants it.

982
01:38:54,204 --> 01:38:56,900
We needs it.

983
01:38:57,074 --> 01:39:01,875
Must have the precious.

984
01:39:02,045 --> 01:39:05,412
They stole it from us.

985
01:39:05,616 --> 01:39:08,983
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

986
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:13,054
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

987
01:39:13,223 --> 01:39:16,488
No. Not master.

988
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:20,494
Yes, precious. False.

989
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:25,158
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

990
01:39:26,303 --> 01:39:28,771
Master's my friend.

991
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:34,002
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

992
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:37,770
Not listening. I'm not listening.

993
01:39:37,948 --> 01:39:41,940
You're a liar and a thief.

994
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:44,142
No.

995
01:39:45,087 --> 01:39:47,988
Murderer.

996
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:51,483
Go away.

997
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:54,027
Go away?

998
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,830
I hate you.

999
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:01,401
I hate you.

1000
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:05,003
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

1001
01:40:05,174 --> 01:40:07,005
I saved us.

1002
01:40:07,176 --> 01:40:11,704
It was me. We survived because of me.

1003
01:40:12,949 --> 01:40:16,510
Not anymore.

1004
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,411
What did you say?

1005
01:40:21,524 --> 01:40:25,358
Master looks after us now.

1006
01:40:25,528 --> 01:40:29,020
We don't need you.

1007
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,290
What?

1008
01:40:31,467 --> 01:40:33,230
Leave now...

1009
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:37,202
and never come back.

1010
01:40:37,373 --> 01:40:38,397
No.

1011
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:43,106
Leave now and never come back.

1012
01:40:45,747 --> 01:40:51,652
Leave now and never come back!

1013
01:41:03,565 --> 01:41:06,261
We told him to go away.

1014
01:41:06,434 --> 01:41:09,403
And away he goes, precious.

1015
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:11,562
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1016
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:13,571
Smeagol is free!

1017
01:41:18,446 --> 01:41:19,936
Look.

1018
01:41:20,148 --> 01:41:24,608
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

1019
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:35,595
They are young.

1020
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:38,289
They are tender. They are nice.

1021
01:41:38,466 --> 01:41:41,993
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1022
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:46,298
You'll make him sick, you will...

1023
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:49,703
behaving like that.

1024
01:41:52,146 --> 01:41:54,876
There's only one way to
eat a brace of coneys.

1025
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,643
What's it doing?

1026
01:42:01,388 --> 01:42:03,982
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1027
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:06,353
It ruins it.

1028
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:10,156
What's to ruin? There's
hardly any meat on them.

1029
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:16,861
What we need is a few good taters.

1030
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:20,798
What's taters, precious?

1031
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:22,703
What's taters? Eh?

1032
01:42:22,876 --> 01:42:24,605
Po-ta-toes.

1033
01:42:24,945 --> 01:42:28,176
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1034
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:35,178
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

1035
01:42:36,523 --> 01:42:38,423
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1036
01:42:38,759 --> 01:42:40,954
Oh, yes, we could.

1037
01:42:41,128 --> 01:42:44,620
Spoil a nice fish.

1038
01:42:45,899 --> 01:42:48,527
Give it to us raw...

1039
01:42:48,702 --> 01:42:51,727
and wriggling.

1040
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,032
You keep nasty chips.

1041
01:42:55,975 --> 01:42:58,034
You're hopeless.

1042
01:43:10,523 --> 01:43:12,013
Mr. Frodo?

1043
01:43:29,909 --> 01:43:32,571
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1044
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:35,247
Servants of Sauron.

1045
01:43:36,048 --> 01:43:38,209
They are called to Mordor.

1046
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:41,409
The Dark One is gathering
all armies to him.

1047
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:44,784
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1048
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:50,022
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1049
01:43:50,196 --> 01:43:55,360
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1050
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:58,694
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1051
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:00,098
Mr. Frodo.

1052
01:44:00,605 --> 01:44:02,232
Look.

1053
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:08,109
It's an oliphaunt.

1054
01:44:16,321 --> 01:44:19,347
No one at home will believe this.

1055
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:32,367
Smeagol?

1056
01:45:12,743 --> 01:45:15,211
We've lingered here too long.

1057
01:45:18,215 --> 01:45:19,546
Come on, Sam.

1058
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:35,726
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1059
01:45:37,434 --> 01:45:42,531
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1060
01:45:42,706 --> 01:45:45,607
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1061
01:45:47,011 --> 01:45:50,378
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1062
01:45:50,547 --> 01:45:52,572
The enemy?

1063
01:45:54,685 --> 01:45:58,177
His sense of duty was no
less than yours, I deem.

1064
01:46:00,623 --> 01:46:02,682
You wonder what his name is...

1065
01:46:04,193 --> 01:46:06,457
where he came from.

1066
01:46:08,431 --> 01:46:10,865
And if he was really evil at heart.

1067
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:15,993
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1068
01:46:17,607 --> 01:46:20,098
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1069
01:46:22,312 --> 01:46:23,802
in peace.

1070
01:46:27,383 --> 01:46:30,409
War will make corpses of us all.

1071
01:46:30,586 --> 01:46:32,645
Bind their hands.

1072
01:46:45,534 --> 01:46:48,230
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

1073
01:46:48,437 --> 01:46:52,100
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1074
01:46:52,274 --> 01:46:55,436
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

1075
01:46:55,843 --> 01:46:57,743
It's the beards.

1076
01:46:57,945 --> 01:47:00,073
This, in turn, has given
rise to the belief...

1077
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:03,116
that there are no Dwarf women...

1078
01:47:03,284 --> 01:47:07,551
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

1079
01:47:09,223 --> 01:47:11,088
which is, of course, ridiculous.

1080
01:47:17,231 --> 01:47:19,461
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1081
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,959
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

1082
01:47:23,904 --> 01:47:27,704
I haven't seen my niece
smile for a long time.

1083
01:47:27,974 --> 01:47:30,739
She was a girl when they
brought her father back dead.

1084
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:33,210
Cut down by Orcs.

1085
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:36,373
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

1086
01:47:36,984 --> 01:47:41,613
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

1087
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:46,350
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

1088
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:58,735
Gimli.

1089
01:47:58,905 --> 01:48:00,964
No, I couldn't

1090
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,972
I really couldn't.

1091
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,107
I made some stew.

1092
01:48:09,281 --> 01:48:12,547
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1093
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,418
Thank you.

1094
01:48:42,914 --> 01:48:45,440
- It's good.
- Really?

1095
01:48:49,421 --> 01:48:52,788
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1096
01:48:54,092 --> 01:48:58,153
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1097
01:48:58,596 --> 01:49:01,065
But he must be mistaken.

1098
01:49:01,332 --> 01:49:05,736
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

1099
01:49:06,871 --> 01:49:10,069
Then you must be at least 60.

1100
01:49:12,177 --> 01:49:13,735
Seventy?

1101
01:49:14,179 --> 01:49:15,841
But you cannot be 80!

1102
01:49:19,184 --> 01:49:20,549
Eighty-seven.

1103
01:49:23,655 --> 01:49:25,748
You are one of the Dunedain.

1104
01:49:26,824 --> 01:49:29,918
A descendant of Numenor,
blessed with long life.

1105
01:49:31,162 --> 01:49:33,790
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1106
01:49:34,465 --> 01:49:36,228
There are few of us left.

1107
01:49:36,402 --> 01:49:39,164
The Northern Kingdom was
destroyed long ago.

1108
01:49:39,938 --> 01:49:43,339
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1109
01:49:57,989 --> 01:50:02,118
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1110
01:50:02,926 --> 01:50:06,362
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1111
01:50:08,198 --> 01:50:10,598
Like my heart.

1112
01:50:12,035 --> 01:50:14,731
Go to sleep.

1113
01:50:14,905 --> 01:50:17,396
I am asleep.

1114
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,814
This is a dream.

1115
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:31,248
Then it is a good dream.

1116
01:50:43,233 --> 01:50:45,325
Sleep.

1117
01:51:09,965 --> 01:51:11,550
Minlû pedich nin...
(You told me once...)

1118
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,350
...i aur hen telitha.
(...this day would come.)

1119
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:19,750
Ú i vethed...nâ i onnad. (This is
not the end...it is the beginning.)

1120
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,250
Boe bedich go Frodo.
(You must go with Frodo.)

1121
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:24,650
Han bâd lîn.
(That is your path.)

1122
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:37,250
Dolen i vâd o nin.
(My path is hidden from me.)

1123
01:51:38,725 --> 01:51:41,950
Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn.
(It is already laid before your feet.)

1124
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,900
Si boe ú-dhannathach.
(You cannot falter now.)

1125
01:51:48,296 --> 01:51:50,195
Arwen...

1126
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:54,850
Ae ú-esteliach nad...
(If you trust nothing else...)

1127
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:57,000
...estelio han...
(...trust this...)

1128
01:51:57,950 --> 01:52:00,200
...estelio ammen.
(...trust us.)

1129
01:52:39,646 --> 01:52:41,477
Where is she?

1130
01:52:42,649 --> 01:52:45,083
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1131
01:52:48,389 --> 01:52:51,152
Our time here is ending.

1132
01:52:51,859 --> 01:52:54,383
Arwen's time is ending.

1133
01:52:55,162 --> 01:52:56,423
Let her go.

1134
01:52:56,597 --> 01:52:58,587
Let her take the ship into the west.

1135
01:52:58,799 --> 01:53:01,859
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

1136
01:53:02,035 --> 01:53:03,832
There it will be ever green.

1137
01:53:05,338 --> 01:53:07,704
But never more than memory.

1138
01:53:08,975 --> 01:53:12,001
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

1139
01:53:12,178 --> 01:53:15,807
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1140
01:53:15,982 --> 01:53:18,280
She belongs with her people.

1141
01:53:18,305 --> 01:53:20,305
SharePirate.Com Subs

1142
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:31,575
Nach gwannatha sin?
(Is this how you leave?)

1143
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:35,128
Ma nathach hi gwannathachor
minuial archened? (Did you

1144
01:53:35,141 --> 01:53:36,750
think you could slip away
at first light unseen?)

1145
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,900
Ú-ethelithon.
(I shall not return.)

1146
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:45,000
Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.
(You underestimate your skill in battle.)

1147
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:46,400
Ethelithach.
(You will return.)

1148
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,900
Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.
(I do not speak of death in battle.)

1149
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:49,850
O man pedich?
(What do you speak of?)

1150
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:57,100
Edra le men...
(The way is open to you...)

1151
01:53:58,190 --> 01:53:59,500
...men na guil edwen...
(...the way to another life...)

1152
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:05,225
...haer o auth...a nîr a naeth.
(...away from war...grief, despair.)

1153
01:54:06,598 --> 01:54:08,429
Why are you saying this?

1154
01:54:10,001 --> 01:54:13,198
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1155
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,301
It was a dream, Arwen.

1156
01:54:17,742 --> 01:54:19,106
Nothing more.

1157
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:23,709
I don't believe you.

1158
01:54:32,724 --> 01:54:34,554
This belongs to you.

1159
01:54:37,328 --> 01:54:38,886
It was a gift.

1160
01:54:41,499 --> 01:54:43,023
Keep it.

1161
01:54:45,536 --> 01:54:46,731
My lord?

1162
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:54,102
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1163
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:19,067
What is it?

1164
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:22,629
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1165
01:55:39,155 --> 01:55:41,179
Wargs!

1166
01:55:53,736 --> 01:55:55,431
A scout!

1167
01:56:01,743 --> 01:56:04,268
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1168
01:56:05,614 --> 01:56:07,809
Get them out of here!

1169
01:56:12,588 --> 01:56:14,579
All riders to the head of the column.

1170
01:56:15,324 --> 01:56:17,293
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1171
01:56:17,492 --> 01:56:19,221
Come on!

1172
01:56:31,039 --> 01:56:33,472
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1173
01:56:33,674 --> 01:56:35,142
- I can fight.
- No!

1174
01:56:37,846 --> 01:56:39,905
You must do this, for me.

1175
01:56:41,917 --> 01:56:43,509
Follow me!

1176
01:56:47,055 --> 01:56:51,354
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1177
01:56:51,559 --> 01:56:54,222
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1178
01:58:06,432 --> 01:58:08,731
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1179
01:58:11,538 --> 01:58:13,095
That one counts as mine!

1180
01:58:29,822 --> 01:58:31,449
Stinking creature.

1181
01:59:58,643 --> 02:00:00,542
Aragorn!

1182
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:06,749
Aragorn?

1183
02:00:20,729 --> 02:00:23,664
Tell me what happened and
I will ease your passing.

1184
02:00:23,834 --> 02:00:25,266
He's...

1185
02:00:25,836 --> 02:00:27,428
dead.

1186
02:00:28,071 --> 02:00:30,971
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1187
02:00:34,577 --> 02:00:35,874
You lie.

1188
02:01:09,778 --> 02:01:11,370
Get the wounded on horses.

1189
02:01:12,715 --> 02:01:15,842
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1190
02:01:16,284 --> 02:01:18,377
Leave the dead.

1191
02:01:25,827 --> 02:01:27,317
Come.

1192
02:01:37,506 --> 02:01:39,029
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1193
02:01:39,208 --> 02:01:42,108
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1194
02:01:44,678 --> 02:01:46,476
We're safe!

1195
02:01:48,016 --> 02:01:50,883
We're safe, my lady.

1196
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:52,246
Thank you.

1197
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:38,029
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1198
02:02:38,197 --> 02:02:39,688
Freda!

1199
02:02:45,438 --> 02:02:48,272
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1200
02:02:52,145 --> 02:02:53,441
Take it to the caves.

1201
02:02:53,646 --> 02:02:56,479
Make way for the king.

1202
02:02:57,516 --> 02:03:01,316
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.

1203
02:03:09,228 --> 02:03:12,959
So few. So few of you have returned.

1204
02:03:15,734 --> 02:03:17,999
Our people are safe.

1205
02:03:19,337 --> 02:03:21,898
We have paid for it with many lives.

1206
02:03:22,741 --> 02:03:24,266
My lady.

1207
02:03:28,013 --> 02:03:30,277
Lord Aragorn...

1208
02:03:30,449 --> 02:03:31,677
where is he?

1209
02:03:33,685 --> 02:03:35,210
He fell.

1210
02:03:57,875 --> 02:04:00,845
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1211
02:04:01,012 --> 02:04:03,947
Bar the gate. And set a
watch on the surround.

1212
02:04:04,182 --> 02:04:07,275
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1213
02:04:07,452 --> 02:04:10,046
Get them into the caves.

1214
02:04:10,922 --> 02:04:15,790
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1215
02:04:17,829 --> 02:04:21,230
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1216
02:04:21,398 --> 02:04:23,731
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1217
02:04:23,901 --> 02:04:26,996
but for a small culvert at its base...

1218
02:04:27,171 --> 02:04:29,935
which is little more than a drain.

1219
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:36,974
How? How can fire undo stone?

1220
02:04:37,148 --> 02:04:41,641
What kind of device could
bring down the wall?

1221
02:04:45,254 --> 02:04:49,248
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1222
02:04:49,425 --> 02:04:52,952
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

1223
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:55,690
thousands, to storm the Keep.

1224
02:04:55,866 --> 02:04:57,298
Tens of thousands.

1225
02:04:57,467 --> 02:05:01,528
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1226
02:05:13,483 --> 02:05:16,577
A new power is rising.

1227
02:05:16,752 --> 02:05:19,744
Its victory is at hand.

1228
02:05:25,429 --> 02:05:27,486
This night...

1229
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:32,263
the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1230
02:05:32,435 --> 02:05:35,768
March to Helm's Deep!

1231
02:05:35,938 --> 02:05:39,374
Leave none alive!

1232
02:05:41,911 --> 02:05:44,378
To war!

1233
02:05:48,316 --> 02:05:52,777
There will be no dawn for Men.

1234
02:06:09,972 --> 02:06:12,029
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1235
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:15,368
There is always smoke rising...

1236
02:06:15,610 --> 02:06:19,444
from Isengard these days.

1237
02:06:19,681 --> 02:06:21,273
Isengard?

1238
02:06:21,483 --> 02:06:23,348
There was a time...

1239
02:06:23,685 --> 02:06:27,211
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1240
02:06:27,388 --> 02:06:30,756
But now he has a mind of metal...

1241
02:06:31,426 --> 02:06:33,859
and wheels.

1242
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:39,123
He no longer cares for growing things.

1243
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:41,097
What is it?

1244
02:06:46,106 --> 02:06:48,301
It's Saruman's army.

1245
02:06:48,509 --> 02:06:50,033
The war has started.

1246
02:07:28,414 --> 02:07:32,783
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

1247
02:08:05,051 --> 02:08:06,915
Brego.

1248
02:08:33,044 --> 02:08:34,239
Arwen.

1249
02:08:35,450 --> 02:08:36,250
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)

1250
02:08:39,230 --> 02:08:41,228
I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar. (The ships

1251
02:08:41,241 --> 02:08:43,250
are leaving for Valinor. Go
now before it is too late.)

1252
02:08:44,022 --> 02:08:45,818
I have made my choice.

1253
02:08:52,263 --> 02:08:55,130
He is not coming back.

1254
02:08:56,567 --> 02:08:59,900
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1255
02:09:00,838 --> 02:09:03,808
There is still hope.

1256
02:09:07,978 --> 02:09:11,744
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1257
02:09:15,152 --> 02:09:18,121
If Sauron is defeated and
Aragorn made king...

1258
02:09:18,289 --> 02:09:20,780
and all that you hope for comes true...

1259
02:09:20,958 --> 02:09:25,656
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1260
02:09:25,929 --> 02:09:28,922
Whether by the sword or
the slow decay of time...

1261
02:09:29,099 --> 02:09:32,069
Aragorn will die.

1262
02:09:34,905 --> 02:09:37,430
And there will be no comfort for you...

1263
02:09:37,641 --> 02:09:41,804
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

1264
02:09:44,615 --> 02:09:47,345
He will come to death...

1265
02:09:47,517 --> 02:09:50,111
an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

1266
02:09:50,287 --> 02:09:54,950
in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1267
02:10:04,067 --> 02:10:08,003
But you, my daughter...

1268
02:10:08,837 --> 02:10:13,865
you will linger on in
darkness and in doubt...

1269
02:10:14,043 --> 02:10:18,104
as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1270
02:10:20,517 --> 02:10:22,916
Here you will dwell...

1271
02:10:23,086 --> 02:10:27,988
bound to your grief under
the fading trees...

1272
02:10:29,726 --> 02:10:31,716
until all the world is changed...

1273
02:10:31,894 --> 02:10:36,389
and the long years of your
life are utterly spent.

1274
02:10:44,907 --> 02:10:46,067
Arwen.

1275
02:10:52,714 --> 02:10:54,977
There is nothing for you here...

1276
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:57,743
only death.

1277
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:20,750
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(And I, do I not have your love?)

1278
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:25,100
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)

1279
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,450
<i>I amar prestar aen.</i>
(The world is changed.)

1280
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:21,500
<i>Han mathon ne nen.</i>
(I feel it in the water.)

1281
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:24,250
<i>Han mathon ne chae,</i>
(I feel it in the earth,)

1282
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:30,500
<i>a han noston ned 'wilith.</i>
(and I smell it in the air.)

1283
02:12:31,210 --> 02:12:34,839
The power of the enemy is growing.

1284
02:12:35,015 --> 02:12:37,642
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

1285
02:12:37,816 --> 02:12:41,184
to destroy the people of Rohan.

1286
02:12:43,255 --> 02:12:46,884
Isengard has been unleashed.

1287
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:54,597
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

1288
02:12:55,734 --> 02:12:58,702
the last free kingdom of Men.

1289
02:12:58,904 --> 02:13:03,307
His war on this country will come swiftly.

1290
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:10,105
He senses the Ring is close.

1291
02:13:10,282 --> 02:13:13,740
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

1292
02:13:13,919 --> 02:13:17,980
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

1293
02:13:19,525 --> 02:13:23,392
the quest will claim his life.

1294
02:13:23,561 --> 02:13:25,723
You know this.

1295
02:13:26,364 --> 02:13:29,197
You have foreseen it.

1296
02:13:31,303 --> 02:13:34,738
It is the risk we all took.

1297
02:13:39,077 --> 02:13:43,275
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

1298
02:13:44,449 --> 02:13:48,886
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

1299
02:13:49,053 --> 02:13:54,513
Men, who are so easily
seduced by its power.

1300
02:13:54,725 --> 02:13:58,287
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1301
02:13:58,495 --> 02:14:02,556
take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1302
02:14:05,003 --> 02:14:06,833
It is close now.

1303
02:14:07,004 --> 02:14:11,270
So close to achieving its goal.

1304
02:14:14,378 --> 02:14:18,008
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1305
02:14:18,182 --> 02:14:22,311
even unto to the ending of the world.

1306
02:14:24,153 --> 02:14:25,985
The time of the Elves...

1307
02:14:26,188 --> 02:14:28,123
is over.

1308
02:14:28,959 --> 02:14:32,554
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

1309
02:14:34,531 --> 02:14:37,795
Do we let them stand alone?

1310
02:14:42,338 --> 02:14:43,703
What news?

1311
02:14:43,874 --> 02:14:46,672
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1312
02:14:46,843 --> 02:14:49,710
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

1313
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:53,907
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1314
02:14:54,083 --> 02:14:56,483
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1315
02:14:56,819 --> 02:14:58,946
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1316
02:14:59,122 --> 02:15:02,523
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1317
02:15:03,627 --> 02:15:07,187
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1318
02:15:07,396 --> 02:15:10,422
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1319
02:15:12,568 --> 02:15:14,763
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1320
02:15:14,937 --> 02:15:17,633
Sauron from Mordor.

1321
02:15:18,941 --> 02:15:22,172
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

1322
02:15:22,343 --> 02:15:24,038
Gondor is weak.

1323
02:15:24,213 --> 02:15:27,340
Sauron will strike us soon.

1324
02:15:28,084 --> 02:15:29,948
And he will strike hard.

1325
02:15:30,386 --> 02:15:34,482
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1326
02:15:48,369 --> 02:15:50,599
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1327
02:15:50,772 --> 02:15:53,502
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1328
02:15:53,675 --> 02:15:55,939
Well, if you're not
spies, then who are you?

1329
02:16:02,817 --> 02:16:04,546
Speak.

1330
02:16:05,652 --> 02:16:08,246
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1331
02:16:08,589 --> 02:16:11,616
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1332
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:13,550
Your bodyguard?

1333
02:16:13,762 --> 02:16:15,525
His gardener.

1334
02:16:16,164 --> 02:16:18,132
And where is your skulking friend?

1335
02:16:19,667 --> 02:16:21,965
That gangrel creature.

1336
02:16:22,303 --> 02:16:24,270
He had an ill-favored look.

1337
02:16:26,006 --> 02:16:27,906
There was no other.

1338
02:16:32,012 --> 02:16:34,345
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1339
02:16:37,684 --> 02:16:40,744
One we lost in Moria...

1340
02:16:41,822 --> 02:16:43,346
two were my kin...

1341
02:16:43,524 --> 02:16:47,255
a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1342
02:16:47,461 --> 02:16:51,363
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1343
02:16:56,370 --> 02:16:58,133
You're a friend of Boromir?

1344
02:17:00,574 --> 02:17:02,064
Yes.

1345
02:17:03,143 --> 02:17:04,235
For my part.

1346
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:13,685
It will grieve you then
to learn that he is dead.

1347
02:17:15,721 --> 02:17:17,189
Dead?

1348
02:17:17,391 --> 02:17:19,415
How? When?

1349
02:17:19,692 --> 02:17:22,319
As one of his companions, I'd
hoped you would tell me.

1350
02:17:22,661 --> 02:17:26,496
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

1351
02:17:29,236 --> 02:17:35,697
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

1352
02:17:35,908 --> 02:17:39,002
It was cloven in two.

1353
02:17:40,612 --> 02:17:44,013
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1354
02:17:46,052 --> 02:17:47,849
He was my brother.

1355
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:39,770
Boromir!

1356
02:18:40,304 --> 02:18:42,170
Boromir!

1357
02:18:46,410 --> 02:18:50,176
This city was once the
jewel of our kingdom.

1358
02:18:50,347 --> 02:18:54,010
A place of light and beauty and music.

1359
02:18:54,184 --> 02:18:56,516
And so it shall be once more!

1360
02:18:59,090 --> 02:19:01,718
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1361
02:19:01,927 --> 02:19:06,294
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

1362
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:15,766
This city of Osgiliath has
been reclaimed for Gondor!

1363
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,107
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1364
02:19:18,274 --> 02:19:21,107
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1365
02:19:29,819 --> 02:19:32,584
Good speech. Nice and short.

1366
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:35,690
Leaves more time for drinking!

1367
02:19:35,992 --> 02:19:40,190
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1368
02:19:43,634 --> 02:19:45,795
Remember today, little brother.

1369
02:19:45,969 --> 02:19:48,961
Today, life is good.

1370
02:19:53,142 --> 02:19:54,734
What?

1371
02:19:55,111 --> 02:19:56,578
He's here.

1372
02:19:59,782 --> 02:20:01,614
One moment of peace, can
he not give us that?

1373
02:20:01,784 --> 02:20:02,807
Where is he?

1374
02:20:02,985 --> 02:20:06,443
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1375
02:20:07,022 --> 02:20:08,717
Father!

1376
02:20:13,596 --> 02:20:15,962
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

1377
02:20:16,132 --> 02:20:19,532
They exaggerate. The victory
belongs to Faramir also.

1378
02:20:21,003 --> 02:20:23,904
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1379
02:20:24,706 --> 02:20:27,004
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1380
02:20:27,176 --> 02:20:29,201
I would have done, but our
numbers were too few.

1381
02:20:29,378 --> 02:20:31,073
Oh, too few.

1382
02:20:31,581 --> 02:20:33,980
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1383
02:20:36,183 --> 02:20:39,176
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1384
02:20:39,388 --> 02:20:41,617
That is not my intent.

1385
02:20:41,823 --> 02:20:45,589
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

1386
02:20:48,963 --> 02:20:51,864
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1387
02:20:52,034 --> 02:20:54,797
I know his uses, and they are few.

1388
02:20:54,970 --> 02:20:58,564
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1389
02:20:59,741 --> 02:21:02,174
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1390
02:21:02,343 --> 02:21:05,210
He will not say why, but I
have guessed its purpose.

1391
02:21:05,379 --> 02:21:09,179
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1392
02:21:11,419 --> 02:21:13,683
The One Ring.

1393
02:21:16,458 --> 02:21:18,778
Isildur's Bane.

1394
02:21:18,791 --> 02:21:21,121
It has fallen into the
hands of the Elves.

1395
02:21:21,294 --> 02:21:24,924
Everyone will try to claim
it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1396
02:21:25,099 --> 02:21:29,229
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1397
02:21:31,039 --> 02:21:33,699
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1398
02:21:33,874 --> 02:21:37,570
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

1399
02:21:37,744 --> 02:21:41,647
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1400
02:21:41,816 --> 02:21:47,117
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

1401
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:52,348
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1402
02:21:52,559 --> 02:21:54,026
He will return.

1403
02:21:54,227 --> 02:21:57,959
And when he does, we will
be powerless to stop him.

1404
02:21:58,131 --> 02:22:00,692
You must go.

1405
02:22:01,867 --> 02:22:03,961
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1406
02:22:04,803 --> 02:22:10,299
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1407
02:22:10,477 --> 02:22:14,174
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1408
02:22:14,347 --> 02:22:17,315
- send me in his stead.
- You?

1409
02:22:18,518 --> 02:22:20,452
Oh, I see.

1410
02:22:20,619 --> 02:22:24,817
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

1411
02:22:25,257 --> 02:22:27,226
I think not.

1412
02:22:27,426 --> 02:22:30,294
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1413
02:22:30,463 --> 02:22:33,363
The one who will not fail me.

1414
02:22:50,449 --> 02:22:53,612
Remember today, little brother.

1415
02:23:12,004 --> 02:23:13,994
Captain Faramir!

1416
02:23:15,274 --> 02:23:17,400
We found the third one.

1417
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,888
You must come with me. Now.

1418
02:23:42,099 --> 02:23:43,191
Down there.

1419
02:23:58,115 --> 02:24:01,015
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1420
02:24:11,628 --> 02:24:13,118
They wait for my command.

1421
02:24:18,602 --> 02:24:19,694
Shall I shoot?

1422
02:24:20,937 --> 02:24:23,963
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

1423
02:24:24,140 --> 02:24:25,971
So juicy sweet

1424
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:29,579
Our only wish To catch a fish

1425
02:24:29,747 --> 02:24:32,441
So juicy sweet

1426
02:24:39,422 --> 02:24:40,820
Wait.

1427
02:24:42,325 --> 02:24:45,157
This creature is bound to me.

1428
02:24:45,761 --> 02:24:47,695
And I to him.

1429
02:24:50,966 --> 02:24:52,264
He is our guide.

1430
02:24:57,007 --> 02:24:58,406
Please...

1431
02:24:58,575 --> 02:25:00,439
let me go down to him.

1432
02:25:11,754 --> 02:25:13,415
Smeagol.

1433
02:25:14,423 --> 02:25:16,652
Master is here.

1434
02:25:17,859 --> 02:25:18,985
Come, Smeagol.

1435
02:25:21,864 --> 02:25:24,492
Trust master. Come.

1436
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:31,503
We must go now?

1437
02:25:31,873 --> 02:25:35,310
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1438
02:25:35,476 --> 02:25:36,875
Follow me. Come on.

1439
02:25:38,112 --> 02:25:39,602
Come.

1440
02:25:42,151 --> 02:25:43,310
Come, Smeagol.

1441
02:25:43,852 --> 02:25:45,876
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1442
02:25:46,421 --> 02:25:47,911
Come on.

1443
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:54,021
Don't hurt him!

1444
02:25:54,196 --> 02:25:56,925
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.

1445
02:25:57,098 --> 02:25:58,396
Master!

1446
02:26:42,817 --> 02:26:47,584
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1447
02:26:48,856 --> 02:26:51,450
Cruel Men hurts us.

1448
02:26:51,659 --> 02:26:54,628
Master tricksed us.

1449
02:26:54,829 --> 02:26:58,390
Of course he did.

1450
02:26:58,766 --> 02:27:02,463
I told you he was tricksy.

1451
02:27:02,636 --> 02:27:05,662
I told you he was false.

1452
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:08,536
Master is our friend.

1453
02:27:08,709 --> 02:27:11,075
Our friend.

1454
02:27:11,245 --> 02:27:13,406
Master betrayed us.

1455
02:27:13,581 --> 02:27:16,573
No. Not its business.

1456
02:27:17,651 --> 02:27:20,119
Leave us alone!

1457
02:27:20,287 --> 02:27:22,687
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1458
02:27:22,857 --> 02:27:25,155
They stole it from us!

1459
02:27:25,326 --> 02:27:26,759
No. No.

1460
02:27:27,328 --> 02:27:28,955
What did they steal?

1461
02:27:31,098 --> 02:27:36,434
My precious!

1462
02:27:40,074 --> 02:27:41,701
We have to get out of here.

1463
02:27:42,309 --> 02:27:44,277
You go. Go, now.

1464
02:27:46,881 --> 02:27:48,746
You can do it.

1465
02:27:50,184 --> 02:27:51,651
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1466
02:27:51,852 --> 02:27:53,615
Just this once.

1467
02:27:53,821 --> 02:27:55,550
Put it on.

1468
02:27:56,023 --> 02:27:58,014
Disappear.

1469
02:27:59,093 --> 02:28:00,151
I can't.

1470
02:28:03,264 --> 02:28:05,494
You were right, Sam.

1471
02:28:06,934 --> 02:28:09,425
You tried to tell me but...

1472
02:28:14,141 --> 02:28:16,302
I'm sorry.

1473
02:28:20,848 --> 02:28:23,715
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1474
02:28:25,152 --> 02:28:26,779
If I put it on...

1475
02:28:26,987 --> 02:28:29,319
he'll find me.

1476
02:28:30,991 --> 02:28:32,959
He'll see.

1477
02:28:34,194 --> 02:28:36,162
Mr. Frodo...

1478
02:28:41,035 --> 02:28:45,301
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

1479
02:28:47,508 --> 02:28:50,500
Here in the Wild I have you...

1480
02:28:50,678 --> 02:28:52,578
two Halflings...

1481
02:28:52,746 --> 02:28:55,909
and a host of men at my call.

1482
02:28:59,253 --> 02:29:02,711
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1483
02:29:12,433 --> 02:29:16,164
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

1484
02:29:17,771 --> 02:29:20,797
to show his quality.

1485
02:29:41,895 --> 02:29:43,487
No!

1486
02:29:46,667 --> 02:29:47,998
Stop it!

1487
02:29:48,168 --> 02:29:49,226
Leave him alone.

1488
02:29:50,571 --> 02:29:53,062
Don't you understand?

1489
02:29:54,375 --> 02:29:56,275
He's got to destroy it!

1490
02:29:56,443 --> 02:29:59,674
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1491
02:29:59,847 --> 02:30:01,508
To the Mountain of Fire!

1492
02:30:02,583 --> 02:30:05,677
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1493
02:30:05,886 --> 02:30:08,855
Please. It's such a burden.

1494
02:30:11,058 --> 02:30:13,117
Will you not help him?

1495
02:30:14,495 --> 02:30:16,395
Captain?

1496
02:30:17,064 --> 02:30:19,294
Prepare to leave.

1497
02:30:24,238 --> 02:30:26,672
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1498
02:31:26,925 --> 02:31:30,350
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)

1499
02:31:39,613 --> 02:31:42,241
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1500
02:31:42,416 --> 02:31:45,476
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

1501
02:31:45,686 --> 02:31:49,417
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1502
02:31:49,623 --> 02:31:53,616
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

1503
02:31:54,328 --> 02:31:55,795
Bless you, laddie.

1504
02:31:56,396 --> 02:31:58,125
Gimli, where is the king?

1505
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:08,100
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)

1506
02:32:11,912 --> 02:32:13,243
You look terrible.

1507
02:32:40,370 --> 02:32:41,800
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

1508
02:32:54,988 --> 02:32:57,013
A great host, you say?

1509
02:32:57,224 --> 02:32:59,886
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1510
02:33:00,561 --> 02:33:03,553
Ten thousand strong at least.

1511
02:33:05,098 --> 02:33:06,531
Ten thousand?

1512
02:33:06,967 --> 02:33:09,458
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1513
02:33:12,139 --> 02:33:14,266
To destroy the world of Men.

1514
02:33:16,777 --> 02:33:18,768
They will be here by nightfall.

1515
02:33:24,618 --> 02:33:25,915
Let them come!

1516
02:33:27,454 --> 02:33:30,184
I want every man and strong
lad able to bear arms...

1517
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:33,518
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1518
02:33:41,702 --> 02:33:44,637
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1519
02:33:44,805 --> 02:33:47,239
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1520
02:33:47,407 --> 02:33:50,137
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1521
02:33:50,310 --> 02:33:52,710
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1522
02:33:53,313 --> 02:33:55,508
These are Uruk-hai.

1523
02:33:55,682 --> 02:33:59,118
Their armor is thick and
their shields broad.

1524
02:34:00,787 --> 02:34:04,416
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1525
02:34:04,625 --> 02:34:08,220
I know how to defend my own keep.

1526
02:34:14,835 --> 02:34:18,236
They will break upon this
fortress like water on rock.

1527
02:34:18,405 --> 02:34:23,638
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

1528
02:34:23,844 --> 02:34:26,506
Crops can be resown...

1529
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:29,672
homes rebuilt.

1530
02:34:30,284 --> 02:34:32,844
Within these walls...

1531
02:34:33,253 --> 02:34:34,720
we will outlast them.

1532
02:34:34,922 --> 02:34:37,322
They do not come to destroy
Rohan's crops or villages.

1533
02:34:37,491 --> 02:34:39,015
They come to destroy its people...

1534
02:34:39,159 --> 02:34:41,627
down to the last child.

1535
02:34:42,529 --> 02:34:44,793
What would you have me do?

1536
02:34:44,965 --> 02:34:46,694
Look at my men.

1537
02:34:46,867 --> 02:34:48,596
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1538
02:34:50,804 --> 02:34:55,207
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

1539
02:34:55,375 --> 02:34:58,401
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1540
02:35:02,049 --> 02:35:03,949
Send out riders, my lord.

1541
02:35:04,251 --> 02:35:07,118
You must call for aid.

1542
02:35:10,424 --> 02:35:12,688
And who will come?

1543
02:35:13,093 --> 02:35:14,685
Elves?

1544
02:35:14,861 --> 02:35:16,920
Dwarves?

1545
02:35:17,698 --> 02:35:20,565
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

1546
02:35:21,401 --> 02:35:23,665
The old alliances are dead.

1547
02:35:24,104 --> 02:35:26,902
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1548
02:35:27,074 --> 02:35:29,269
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

1549
02:35:30,243 --> 02:35:33,474
Where was Gondor when our
enemies closed in around us?!

1550
02:35:33,647 --> 02:35:35,581
Where was Gon...?

1551
02:35:38,251 --> 02:35:40,151
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1552
02:35:41,755 --> 02:35:44,223
we are alone.

1553
02:35:51,098 --> 02:35:52,827
Get the women and children into the caves.

1554
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,262
We need more time to lay provisions...

1555
02:35:54,434 --> 02:35:57,926
There is no time. War is upon us.

1556
02:35:58,205 --> 02:35:59,900
Secure the gate.

1557
02:36:05,112 --> 02:36:07,205
We Ents have not troubled...

1558
02:36:07,414 --> 02:36:10,781
about the wars of Men and wizards...

1559
02:36:11,551 --> 02:36:14,543
for a very long time.

1560
02:36:15,822 --> 02:36:20,589
But now, something is about to happen...

1561
02:36:20,761 --> 02:36:23,093
that has not happened...

1562
02:36:23,296 --> 02:36:25,764
for an age.

1563
02:36:26,967 --> 02:36:29,231
Entmoot.

1564
02:36:29,669 --> 02:36:30,658
What's that?

1565
02:36:31,071 --> 02:36:33,904
'Tis a gathering.

1566
02:36:35,108 --> 02:36:37,668
A gathering of what?

1567
02:36:55,629 --> 02:36:57,995
Beech. Oak.

1568
02:36:58,165 --> 02:37:00,065
Chestnut. Ash.

1569
02:37:00,333 --> 02:37:02,301
Good. Good. Good.

1570
02:37:02,469 --> 02:37:04,835
Many have come.

1571
02:37:12,379 --> 02:37:15,143
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1572
02:37:15,315 --> 02:37:17,875
will go to war.

1573
02:37:26,860 --> 02:37:29,920
Move back! Move to the caves!

1574
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:34,458
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1575
02:37:34,868 --> 02:37:37,166
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1576
02:37:37,337 --> 02:37:39,567
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1577
02:37:39,739 --> 02:37:42,867
Aragorn, you must rest.

1578
02:37:43,043 --> 02:37:45,443
You're no use to us half alive.

1579
02:37:45,912 --> 02:37:47,106
Aragorn!

1580
02:37:50,517 --> 02:37:53,543
I'm to be sent with the
women into the caves.

1581
02:37:53,753 --> 02:37:55,380
That is an honorable charge.

1582
02:37:55,589 --> 02:37:58,456
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1583
02:37:58,625 --> 02:38:00,320
What renown is there in that?

1584
02:38:00,494 --> 02:38:04,191
My lady, a time may come
for valor without renown.

1585
02:38:04,464 --> 02:38:07,262
Who then will your people
look to in the last defense?

1586
02:38:07,434 --> 02:38:12,428
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1587
02:38:12,739 --> 02:38:15,537
You do not command the others to stay!

1588
02:38:15,709 --> 02:38:19,475
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

1589
02:38:20,647 --> 02:38:22,842
Because they love you.

1590
02:38:29,990 --> 02:38:31,480
I'm sorry.

1591
02:39:37,424 --> 02:39:40,655
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1592
02:39:41,728 --> 02:39:43,525
These are no soldiers.

1593
02:39:45,799 --> 02:39:49,257
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1594
02:39:53,206 --> 02:39:56,107
Look at them. They're frightened.

1595
02:39:56,276 --> 02:39:57,743
I can see it in their eyes.

1596
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:03,600
Boe a hyn
(And they should be)

1597
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:06,200
Neled herain...
(Three Hundred...)

1598
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:07,520
...dan caer menig
(...against Ten Thousand)

1599
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:10,788
Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(They have more

1600
02:40:10,801 --> 02:40:11,850
hope of defending themselves
here than at Edoras)

1601
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:16,200
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)

1602
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,400
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!)

1603
02:40:18,732 --> 02:40:20,927
Then I shall die as one of them!

1604
02:40:27,374 --> 02:40:29,205
Let him go, lad.

1605
02:40:29,776 --> 02:40:31,744
Let him be.

1606
02:40:33,213 --> 02:40:38,674
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

1607
02:40:42,922 --> 02:40:44,822
My lord?

1608
02:40:46,893 --> 02:40:49,453
Who am I, Gamling?

1609
02:40:52,832 --> 02:40:56,734
You are our king, sire.

1610
02:40:59,739 --> 02:41:03,004
And do you trust your king?

1611
02:41:04,544 --> 02:41:07,707
Your men, my lord...

1612
02:41:07,881 --> 02:41:10,679
will follow you to whatever end.

1613
02:41:17,590 --> 02:41:19,490
To whatever end.

1614
02:41:29,336 --> 02:41:32,897
Where is the horse and the rider?

1615
02:41:33,073 --> 02:41:36,133
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1616
02:41:37,644 --> 02:41:42,013
They have passed like
rain on the mountains.

1617
02:41:43,016 --> 02:41:46,247
Like wind in the meadow.

1618
02:41:49,956 --> 02:41:53,722
The days have gone down in the West...

1619
02:41:54,427 --> 02:41:57,055
behind the hills...

1620
02:41:58,965 --> 02:42:00,592
into Shadow.

1621
02:42:09,042 --> 02:42:12,478
How did it come to this?

1622
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:35,665
It's been going for hours.

1623
02:42:36,803 --> 02:42:39,169
They must have decided something by now.

1624
02:42:39,339 --> 02:42:43,435
Decided? No.

1625
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:48,741
We only just finished saying...

1626
02:42:49,949 --> 02:42:51,814
good morning.

1627
02:42:53,186 --> 02:42:56,349
But it's nighttime already.

1628
02:42:56,556 --> 02:42:58,353
You can't take forever.

1629
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:01,384
Don't be hasty.

1630
02:43:01,861 --> 02:43:04,261
We're running out of time!

1631
02:43:07,267 --> 02:43:10,236
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1632
02:43:27,821 --> 02:43:29,118
Give me your sword.

1633
02:43:38,631 --> 02:43:39,757
What is your name?

1634
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:42,666
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1635
02:43:44,804 --> 02:43:47,432
The men are saying we will
not live out the night.

1636
02:43:49,409 --> 02:43:51,377
They say that it is hopeless.

1637
02:44:09,229 --> 02:44:10,856
This is a good sword.

1638
02:44:12,899 --> 02:44:15,231
Haleth, son of Hama...

1639
02:44:19,572 --> 02:44:21,733
there is always hope.

1640
02:44:44,664 --> 02:44:48,031
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1641
02:44:48,201 --> 02:44:49,759
Forgive me.

1642
02:44:49,936 --> 02:44:51,369
I was wrong to despair.

1643
02:44:54,300 --> 02:44:56,650
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)

1644
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:03,378
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1645
02:45:06,853 --> 02:45:08,878
It's a little tight across the chest.

1646
02:45:15,094 --> 02:45:17,062
That is no Orc horn.

1647
02:45:22,735 --> 02:45:24,566
Send for the king.

1648
02:45:24,737 --> 02:45:28,332
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1649
02:45:59,973 --> 02:46:01,634
How is this possible?

1650
02:46:02,642 --> 02:46:06,271
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1651
02:46:06,446 --> 02:46:09,677
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1652
02:46:10,383 --> 02:46:14,615
Long ago we fought and died together.

1653
02:46:16,923 --> 02:46:19,600
We come to honor that allegiance.

1654
02:46:19,800 --> 02:46:21,600
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!)

1655
02:46:28,301 --> 02:46:30,235
You are most welcome.

1656
02:46:35,608 --> 02:46:39,544
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1657
02:47:13,212 --> 02:47:16,477
You could have picked a better spot.

1658
02:47:21,387 --> 02:47:25,551
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

1659
02:47:31,731 --> 02:47:33,528
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1660
02:47:34,167 --> 02:47:36,658
Let's hope they last the night.

1661
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:37,800
A Eruchîn...
(O, Children of Eru...)

1662
02:48:38,100 --> 02:48:39,800
...ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(...show them no mercy...)

1663
02:48:40,750 --> 02:48:43,500
...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!)

1664
02:49:18,070 --> 02:49:20,868
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1665
02:49:22,141 --> 02:49:23,938
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1666
02:50:03,025 --> 02:50:03,850
Dartho!
(Hold!)

1667
02:50:27,139 --> 02:50:28,936
So it begins.

1668
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,200
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!)

1669
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:44,950
Faeg i-varv...
(Their armour is weak...)

1670
02:50:46,350 --> 02:50:47,250
...dîn na lanc...
(...at the throat...)

1671
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:48,550
...a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)

1672
02:50:48,750 --> 02:50:50,750
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!)

1673
02:50:55,768 --> 02:50:57,133
Did they hit anything?

1674
02:50:57,803 --> 02:50:59,794
Give them a volley.

1675
02:50:59,972 --> 02:51:02,065
- Fire!
- Fire!

1676
02:51:17,823 --> 02:51:19,518
Send them to me! Come on!

1677
02:51:38,500 --> 02:51:39,900
Pendraith!
(Ladders!)

1678
02:51:40,212 --> 02:51:41,304
Good!

1679
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:51,089
Swords! Swords!

1680
02:52:29,228 --> 02:52:31,355
Legolas! Two already!

1681
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:33,657
I'm on 17!

1682
02:52:33,833 --> 02:52:36,393
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1683
02:52:43,142 --> 02:52:44,871
Nineteen!

1684
02:53:10,870 --> 02:53:12,303
Merry.

1685
02:53:16,709 --> 02:53:20,509
We have just agreed.

1686
02:53:30,556 --> 02:53:32,023
Yes?

1687
02:53:33,526 --> 02:53:37,690
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1688
02:53:38,831 --> 02:53:41,994
and we have agreed...

1689
02:53:42,468 --> 02:53:46,495
you are not Orcs.

1690
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:50,367
Well, that's good news.

1691
02:53:50,543 --> 02:53:54,673
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

1692
02:53:55,314 --> 02:53:59,114
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1693
02:53:59,285 --> 02:54:00,809
Hasty?

1694
02:54:01,620 --> 02:54:03,520
Our friends are out there.

1695
02:54:03,689 --> 02:54:07,853
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1696
02:54:08,194 --> 02:54:10,458
War? Yes.

1697
02:54:10,629 --> 02:54:12,529
It affects us all.

1698
02:54:12,698 --> 02:54:15,690
Tree, root and twig.

1699
02:54:16,569 --> 02:54:20,596
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1700
02:54:20,806 --> 02:54:22,740
it takes a long time...

1701
02:54:22,908 --> 02:54:27,811
to say anything in Old Entish...

1702
02:54:27,980 --> 02:54:32,212
and we never say anything...

1703
02:54:32,384 --> 02:54:36,320
unless it is worth taking...

1704
02:54:36,489 --> 02:54:40,448
a long time to say.

1705
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:44,559
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1706
02:54:44,730 --> 02:54:45,788
Nineteen!

1707
02:54:46,365 --> 02:54:48,230
Twenty!

1708
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:50,061
Twenty-one!

1709
02:55:00,146 --> 02:55:01,137
Causeway!

1710
02:55:01,250 --> 02:55:03,550
Towards the causeway!

1711
02:55:09,955 --> 02:55:12,321
Is this it?

1712
02:55:12,491 --> 02:55:15,426
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1713
02:55:41,500 --> 02:55:43,250
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!)

1714
02:55:46,050 --> 02:55:47,250
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

1715
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:48,750
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

1716
02:56:41,413 --> 02:56:42,778
Brace the gate!

1717
02:57:01,133 --> 02:57:03,397
Hold them! Stand firm!

1718
02:57:11,277 --> 02:57:12,608
Aragorn!

1719
02:57:17,249 --> 02:57:18,443
Gimli!

1720
02:57:24,550 --> 02:57:26,000
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!)

1721
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:30,800
Herio!
(Charge!)

1722
02:58:07,199 --> 02:58:11,135
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1723
02:58:11,904 --> 02:58:15,931
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1724
02:58:16,742 --> 02:58:18,835
How can that be your decision?!

1725
02:58:19,511 --> 02:58:23,140
This is not our war.

1726
02:58:23,449 --> 02:58:25,644
But you're part of this world!

1727
02:58:29,822 --> 02:58:31,653
Aren't you?!

1728
02:58:35,728 --> 02:58:38,094
You must help. Please.

1729
02:58:39,331 --> 02:58:42,095
You must do something.

1730
02:58:42,368 --> 02:58:46,668
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1731
02:58:47,873 --> 02:58:51,604
But your part in this tale is over.

1732
02:58:51,777 --> 02:58:54,007
Go back to your home.

1733
02:59:04,056 --> 02:59:06,320
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1734
02:59:06,492 --> 02:59:08,357
We don't belong here, Merry.

1735
02:59:08,527 --> 02:59:10,791
It's too big for us.

1736
02:59:10,963 --> 02:59:13,625
What can we do in the end?

1737
02:59:15,934 --> 02:59:18,562
We've got the Shire.

1738
02:59:19,104 --> 02:59:21,629
Maybe we should go home.

1739
02:59:23,475 --> 02:59:26,706
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1740
02:59:26,879 --> 02:59:31,782
and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1741
02:59:31,950 --> 02:59:33,542
And...

1742
02:59:35,387 --> 02:59:38,413
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

1743
02:59:41,927 --> 02:59:44,862
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1744
03:00:04,383 --> 03:00:05,611
Aragorn!

1745
03:00:05,784 --> 03:00:08,150
Fall back to the Keep!

1746
03:00:08,353 --> 03:00:11,413
Get your men out of there!

1747
03:00:12,550 --> 03:00:14,000
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!)

1748
03:00:18,500 --> 03:00:19,750
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1749
03:00:21,099 --> 03:00:22,760
Haldir!

1750
03:00:23,550 --> 03:00:24,900
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1751
03:00:26,872 --> 03:00:30,137
What are you doing? What
are you stopping for?

1752
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:31,950
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1753
03:00:49,328 --> 03:00:50,556
Haldir!

1754
03:01:33,272 --> 03:01:34,762
Brace the gate!

1755
03:01:37,009 --> 03:01:38,306
Hold them!

1756
03:01:40,078 --> 03:01:43,445
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1757
03:02:11,610 --> 03:02:13,544
Make way!

1758
03:02:16,448 --> 03:02:18,177
We cannot hold much longer!

1759
03:02:24,189 --> 03:02:27,716
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1760
03:02:27,926 --> 03:02:30,486
As long as you can give me.

1761
03:02:30,662 --> 03:02:32,323
Gimli!

1762
03:02:33,799 --> 03:02:35,164
Timbers!

1763
03:02:35,334 --> 03:02:37,302
Brace the gate!

1764
03:02:52,017 --> 03:02:53,712
Come on. We can take them.

1765
03:02:54,586 --> 03:02:56,178
It's a long way.

1766
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:03,223
Toss me.

1767
03:03:04,396 --> 03:03:06,227
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1768
03:03:06,398 --> 03:03:07,956
You'll have to toss me!

1769
03:03:13,572 --> 03:03:14,834
Don't tell the Elf.

1770
03:03:15,374 --> 03:03:17,137
Not a word.

1771
03:03:32,424 --> 03:03:33,857
Shore up the door!

1772
03:03:34,026 --> 03:03:36,119
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1773
03:03:36,294 --> 03:03:37,352
Watch our backs!

1774
03:03:41,433 --> 03:03:43,663
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1775
03:04:33,652 --> 03:04:35,051
Hold fast the gate!

1776
03:04:39,257 --> 03:04:42,192
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1777
03:04:46,932 --> 03:04:48,524
Aragorn!

1778
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,434
Pull everybody back.

1779
03:05:24,803 --> 03:05:26,600
Pull them back.

1780
03:05:27,139 --> 03:05:28,606
Fall back!

1781
03:05:28,774 --> 03:05:31,265
Fall back!

1782
03:05:32,444 --> 03:05:34,139
They have broken through!

1783
03:05:34,312 --> 03:05:36,576
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1784
03:05:36,748 --> 03:05:38,978
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1785
03:05:39,084 --> 03:05:41,678
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1786
03:05:41,887 --> 03:05:44,117
Into the Keep!

1787
03:05:55,600 --> 03:06:00,560
I will leave you at the western
borders of the forest.

1788
03:06:00,739 --> 03:06:05,438
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1789
03:06:11,183 --> 03:06:12,445
Wait! Stop!

1790
03:06:13,351 --> 03:06:14,841
Stop!

1791
03:06:17,989 --> 03:06:19,684
Turn around.

1792
03:06:20,625 --> 03:06:23,321
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1793
03:06:23,495 --> 03:06:28,489
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1794
03:06:28,834 --> 03:06:31,530
Yes. Exactly.

1795
03:06:31,703 --> 03:06:34,934
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1796
03:06:35,106 --> 03:06:37,768
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1797
03:06:37,943 --> 03:06:39,934
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1798
03:06:42,547 --> 03:06:45,573
That doesn't make sense to me.

1799
03:06:45,750 --> 03:06:46,910
But then...

1800
03:06:47,118 --> 03:06:49,780
you are very small.

1801
03:06:50,288 --> 03:06:52,017
Perhaps you're right.

1802
03:06:54,693 --> 03:06:56,183
South it is, then.

1803
03:06:57,729 --> 03:07:01,062
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1804
03:07:03,101 --> 03:07:05,865
I always like going south.

1805
03:07:06,037 --> 03:07:10,337
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1806
03:07:10,942 --> 03:07:13,410
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1807
03:07:13,578 --> 03:07:15,512
No, we won't.

1808
03:07:16,248 --> 03:07:18,512
Not this time.

1809
03:07:25,190 --> 03:07:26,179
Look!

1810
03:07:27,859 --> 03:07:30,293
Osgiliath burns!

1811
03:07:30,462 --> 03:07:31,895
Mordor has come.

1812
03:07:33,031 --> 03:07:35,431
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1813
03:07:36,768 --> 03:07:38,963
It has only the power to destroy.

1814
03:07:39,804 --> 03:07:41,237
Please...

1815
03:07:41,406 --> 03:07:43,033
let me go.

1816
03:07:44,075 --> 03:07:45,667
Hurry.

1817
03:07:49,147 --> 03:07:50,546
Faramir!

1818
03:07:50,715 --> 03:07:53,206
You must let me go!

1819
03:07:53,652 --> 03:07:57,110
And those little family of field mice...

1820
03:07:57,289 --> 03:08:00,122
that climb up sometimes, and
they tickle me awfully.

1821
03:08:00,859 --> 03:08:04,158
They're always trying to get
somewhere where they...

1822
03:08:15,340 --> 03:08:18,275
Many of these trees were my friends.

1823
03:08:18,977 --> 03:08:23,607
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

1824
03:08:24,783 --> 03:08:25,977
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1825
03:08:26,151 --> 03:08:28,915
They had voices of their own.

1826
03:08:31,189 --> 03:08:33,714
Saruman.

1827
03:08:34,092 --> 03:08:37,152
A wizard should know better!

1828
03:08:51,376 --> 03:08:55,005
There is no curse in Elvish...

1829
03:08:55,213 --> 03:08:57,875
Entish or the tongues of Men...

1830
03:08:58,049 --> 03:09:00,381
for this treachery.

1831
03:09:01,820 --> 03:09:04,653
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1832
03:09:09,361 --> 03:09:10,555
Where are they going?

1833
03:09:11,096 --> 03:09:14,327
They have business with the Orcs.

1834
03:09:14,799 --> 03:09:19,065
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1835
03:09:19,237 --> 03:09:21,865
with rock and stone.

1836
03:09:45,764 --> 03:09:46,890
Yes.

1837
03:09:47,999 --> 03:09:49,432
Come, my friends.

1838
03:09:50,769 --> 03:09:54,967
The Ents are going to war.

1839
03:09:55,140 --> 03:09:56,903
It is likely...

1840
03:09:57,075 --> 03:10:00,602
that we go to our doom.

1841
03:10:02,013 --> 03:10:04,481
Last march...

1842
03:10:05,016 --> 03:10:07,041
of the Ents.

1843
03:10:55,166 --> 03:10:58,897
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1844
03:10:59,070 --> 03:11:01,129
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1845
03:11:03,908 --> 03:11:05,375
Mr. Frodo?

1846
03:11:05,677 --> 03:11:09,773
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1847
03:11:09,948 --> 03:11:12,439
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1848
03:11:26,798 --> 03:11:28,197
Take them to my father.

1849
03:11:29,767 --> 03:11:32,759
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1850
03:11:35,173 --> 03:11:38,199
A weapon that will change
our fortunes in this war.

1851
03:11:39,310 --> 03:11:42,006
Do you want to know what
happened to Boromir?

1852
03:11:42,647 --> 03:11:45,411
You want to know why your brother died?

1853
03:11:45,917 --> 03:11:49,648
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1854
03:11:49,854 --> 03:11:51,754
He tried to kill him!

1855
03:11:51,923 --> 03:11:54,255
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1856
03:11:55,026 --> 03:11:56,891
Watch out!

1857
03:12:07,805 --> 03:12:08,931
Mr. Frodo?

1858
03:12:11,576 --> 03:12:13,407
They're here.

1859
03:12:16,514 --> 03:12:18,982
They've come.

1860
03:12:21,586 --> 03:12:23,486
Nazgul!

1861
03:12:45,543 --> 03:12:47,704
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1862
03:12:49,514 --> 03:12:51,744
Take cover!

1863
03:13:09,100 --> 03:13:10,658
The fortress is taken.

1864
03:13:11,436 --> 03:13:12,630
It is over.

1865
03:13:12,804 --> 03:13:16,740
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

1866
03:13:16,908 --> 03:13:19,843
They still defend it. They
have died defending it.

1867
03:13:22,580 --> 03:13:23,979
They're breaking in!

1868
03:13:26,618 --> 03:13:29,109
They're past the door!

1869
03:13:32,490 --> 03:13:36,620
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1870
03:13:39,230 --> 03:13:41,164
Is there no other way?

1871
03:13:42,734 --> 03:13:45,794
There is one passage. It
leads into the mountains.

1872
03:13:46,471 --> 03:13:48,666
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1873
03:13:53,544 --> 03:13:55,944
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1874
03:13:56,114 --> 03:13:58,981
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1875
03:14:01,185 --> 03:14:04,586
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

1876
03:14:09,260 --> 03:14:10,693
Ride out with me.

1877
03:14:14,799 --> 03:14:16,426
Ride out and meet them.

1878
03:14:17,201 --> 03:14:19,362
For death and glory.

1879
03:14:19,537 --> 03:14:20,936
For Rohan.

1880
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:23,907
For your people.

1881
03:14:24,642 --> 03:14:26,576
The sun is rising.

1882
03:14:31,082 --> 03:14:34,074
Look to my coming at first
light on the fifth day.

1883
03:14:34,252 --> 03:14:35,651
At dawn...

1884
03:14:35,853 --> 03:14:37,514
look to the east.

1885
03:14:41,693 --> 03:14:43,320
Yes.

1886
03:14:45,797 --> 03:14:47,458
Yes.

1887
03:14:48,800 --> 03:14:51,200
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1888
03:14:51,369 --> 03:14:54,167
shall sound in the Deep...

1889
03:14:54,605 --> 03:14:56,596
one last time.

1890
03:14:56,774 --> 03:14:58,264
Yes!

1891
03:15:01,312 --> 03:15:05,112
Let this be the hour when
we draw swords together.

1892
03:15:12,924 --> 03:15:14,255
Fell deeds, awake.

1893
03:15:15,460 --> 03:15:16,518
Now for wrath...

1894
03:15:16,728 --> 03:15:20,129
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1895
03:15:27,171 --> 03:15:29,435
Forth Eorlingas!

1896
03:16:17,221 --> 03:16:18,415
Gandalf.

1897
03:16:25,730 --> 03:16:29,393
Theoden King stands alone.

1898
03:16:30,001 --> 03:16:32,162
Not alone.

1899
03:16:32,570 --> 03:16:33,696
Rohirrim!

1900
03:16:39,610 --> 03:16:40,770
Eomer.

1901
03:16:40,945 --> 03:16:43,470
To the king!

1902
03:18:01,125 --> 03:18:02,888
Yes!

1903
03:18:12,036 --> 03:18:15,472
A hit. A fine hit.

1904
03:18:39,997 --> 03:18:42,465
Break the dam!

1905
03:18:42,633 --> 03:18:46,069
Release the river!

1906
03:19:13,431 --> 03:19:16,161
Pippin! Hold on!

1907
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:24,374
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1908
03:20:05,683 --> 03:20:07,708
What are you doing?

1909
03:20:16,327 --> 03:20:17,851
Where are you going?

1910
03:21:16,053 --> 03:21:17,350
It's me.

1911
03:21:19,890 --> 03:21:22,085
It's your Sam.

1912
03:21:26,430 --> 03:21:29,058
Don't you know your Sam?

1913
03:21:46,717 --> 03:21:50,084
I can't do this, Sam.

1914
03:21:51,021 --> 03:21:52,989
I know.

1915
03:21:54,024 --> 03:21:56,390
It's all wrong.

1916
03:21:57,128 --> 03:21:59,153
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1917
03:22:06,570 --> 03:22:08,663
But we are.

1918
03:22:15,079 --> 03:22:18,105
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1919
03:22:18,282 --> 03:22:20,682
The ones that really mattered.

1920
03:22:21,719 --> 03:22:24,711
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1921
03:22:24,922 --> 03:22:27,891
And sometimes you didn't
want to know the end...

1922
03:22:28,058 --> 03:22:30,993
because how could the end be happy?

1923
03:22:33,564 --> 03:22:35,759
How could the world go
back to the way it was...

1924
03:22:35,933 --> 03:22:39,369
when so much bad had happened?

1925
03:22:40,204 --> 03:22:42,104
Victory!

1926
03:22:42,273 --> 03:22:43,831
We have victory!

1927
03:22:44,008 --> 03:22:47,944
But in the end, it's
only a passing thing...

1928
03:22:48,112 --> 03:22:49,443
this shadow.

1929
03:22:49,613 --> 03:22:52,013
Even darkness must pass.

1930
03:22:52,183 --> 03:22:54,879
A new day will come.

1931
03:22:55,085 --> 03:22:59,021
And when the sun shines, it
will shine out the clearer.

1932
03:23:00,958 --> 03:23:03,324
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1933
03:23:03,494 --> 03:23:05,257
that meant something.

1934
03:23:05,429 --> 03:23:07,989
Even if you were too
small to understand why.

1935
03:23:09,366 --> 03:23:13,234
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1936
03:23:13,404 --> 03:23:14,962
I know now.

1937
03:23:15,806 --> 03:23:18,001
Folk in those stories...

1938
03:23:18,175 --> 03:23:22,305
had lots of chances of turning
back, only they didn't.

1939
03:23:22,479 --> 03:23:24,709
They kept going...

1940
03:23:25,382 --> 03:23:28,647
because they were holding on to something.

1941
03:23:30,287 --> 03:23:32,585
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1942
03:23:44,468 --> 03:23:48,404
That there's some good in
this world, Mr. Frodo.

1943
03:23:48,672 --> 03:23:51,300
And it's worth fighting for.

1944
03:24:18,235 --> 03:24:22,535
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

1945
03:24:23,274 --> 03:24:27,233
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

1946
03:24:27,411 --> 03:24:29,606
If you let them go, your
life will be forfeit.

1947
03:24:33,984 --> 03:24:35,383
Then it is forfeit.

1948
03:24:38,155 --> 03:24:39,850
Release them.

1949
03:24:51,936 --> 03:24:53,995
Stay out of the forest!

1950
03:24:54,171 --> 03:24:55,968
Keep away from the trees!

1951
03:25:46,790 --> 03:25:48,587
Final count...

1952
03:25:48,759 --> 03:25:51,660
- 42.
- 42?

1953
03:25:53,130 --> 03:25:57,897
That's not bad for a
pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

1954
03:25:58,702 --> 03:26:02,365
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1955
03:26:06,477 --> 03:26:09,776
- 43.
- He was already dead.

1956
03:26:10,547 --> 03:26:13,038
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1957
03:26:13,217 --> 03:26:17,916
because he's got my ax embedded
in his nervous system!

1958
03:26:20,157 --> 03:26:24,856
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1959
03:26:25,129 --> 03:26:28,656
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

1960
03:26:28,832 --> 03:26:31,801
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1961
03:26:31,969 --> 03:26:34,802
I hear the staff are very good.

1962
03:26:40,477 --> 03:26:42,843
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1963
03:26:43,013 --> 03:26:47,279
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1964
03:26:47,451 --> 03:26:48,679
I'm starving.

1965
03:26:48,886 --> 03:26:51,946
Good luck trying to find
something decent around here.

1966
03:26:52,156 --> 03:26:55,182
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1967
03:27:19,183 --> 03:27:21,583
Saruman's storeroom!

1968
03:27:23,954 --> 03:27:26,650
I don't believe it.

1969
03:27:26,857 --> 03:27:28,882
It can't be.

1970
03:27:29,526 --> 03:27:32,427
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1971
03:27:33,730 --> 03:27:36,028
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1972
03:27:36,400 --> 03:27:39,426
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1973
03:27:39,603 --> 03:27:40,729
Wait.

1974
03:27:41,472 --> 03:27:42,700
Do you think we should
share it with Treebeard?

1975
03:27:42,873 --> 03:27:44,397
Share it?

1976
03:27:46,243 --> 03:27:48,643
No. No.

1977
03:27:50,147 --> 03:27:51,478
Dead plant and all that.

1978
03:27:51,915 --> 03:27:54,076
Don't think he'd understand.

1979
03:27:55,385 --> 03:27:57,546
Could be a distant relative.

1980
03:27:58,355 --> 03:28:00,846
I get it.

1981
03:28:01,058 --> 03:28:03,856
Don't be hasty.

1982
03:28:04,962 --> 03:28:06,725
Exactly.

1983
03:28:07,798 --> 03:28:10,062
Bar-hrum.

1984
03:28:35,726 --> 03:28:37,023
This is the old sewer.

1985
03:28:37,194 --> 03:28:40,254
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1986
03:28:40,430 --> 03:28:42,159
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1987
03:28:43,233 --> 03:28:45,701
Captain Faramir...

1988
03:28:46,336 --> 03:28:48,167
you have shown your quality, sir.

1989
03:28:50,674 --> 03:28:51,971
The very highest.

1990
03:28:52,476 --> 03:28:55,104
The Shire must truly be a
great realm, Master Gamgee...

1991
03:28:55,279 --> 03:28:58,214
where gardeners are held in high honor.

1992
03:28:59,416 --> 03:29:01,384
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1993
03:29:02,019 --> 03:29:03,543
Gollum says there's a path...

1994
03:29:03,754 --> 03:29:07,690
near Minas Morgul that climbs
up into the mountains.

1995
03:29:08,158 --> 03:29:09,887
Cirith Ungol?

1996
03:29:13,430 --> 03:29:15,990
- Is that its name?
- No.

1997
03:29:16,166 --> 03:29:17,827
No!

1998
03:29:18,669 --> 03:29:21,661
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1999
03:29:22,039 --> 03:29:25,566
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

2000
03:29:26,476 --> 03:29:29,001
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

2001
03:29:29,346 --> 03:29:35,615
Master says we must go to
Mordor, so we must try.

2002
03:29:37,154 --> 03:29:38,917
I must.

2003
03:29:42,459 --> 03:29:46,020
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

2004
03:29:46,196 --> 03:29:48,221
Thank you.

2005
03:30:00,043 --> 03:30:04,173
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

2006
03:30:16,660 --> 03:30:18,184
Come on, keep up.

2007
03:30:21,665 --> 03:30:24,463
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for
them Rangers to hurt you.

2008
03:30:25,102 --> 03:30:26,933
You know that, don't you?

2009
03:30:27,738 --> 03:30:29,296
He was trying to save you, see?

2010
03:30:29,806 --> 03:30:31,330
Save me?

2011
03:30:31,675 --> 03:30:33,836
So there's no hard feelings.

2012
03:30:34,011 --> 03:30:39,074
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

2013
03:30:39,249 --> 03:30:41,877
Gollum, Gollum.

2014
03:30:42,953 --> 03:30:44,682
Yes, master.

2015
03:30:45,789 --> 03:30:48,622
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

2016
03:30:48,792 --> 03:30:51,090
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2017
03:30:56,600 --> 03:31:01,799
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

2018
03:31:08,945 --> 03:31:11,937
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2019
03:31:12,616 --> 03:31:16,143
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

2020
03:31:21,325 --> 03:31:24,761
All our hopes now lie with
two little Hobbits...

2021
03:31:25,729 --> 03:31:28,960
somewhere in the wilderness.

2022
03:31:32,269 --> 03:31:35,670
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

2023
03:31:35,839 --> 03:31:37,204
What?

2024
03:31:37,374 --> 03:31:41,276
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2025
03:31:41,445 --> 03:31:44,710
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

2026
03:31:44,881 --> 03:31:47,816
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

2027
03:31:47,984 --> 03:31:49,645
"Yes, my boy.

2028
03:31:49,853 --> 03:31:53,653
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

2029
03:31:53,824 --> 03:31:56,315
Well, you've left out one
of the chief characters:

2030
03:31:56,526 --> 03:31:58,426
"Samwise the Brave."

2031
03:31:58,595 --> 03:32:01,325
I want to hear more about Sam.

2032
03:32:05,635 --> 03:32:08,627
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

2033
03:32:09,973 --> 03:32:14,000
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

2034
03:32:15,112 --> 03:32:16,477
So was I.

2035
03:32:25,389 --> 03:32:28,051
"Samwise the Brave."

2036
03:32:32,362 --> 03:32:33,693
Smeagol?

2037
03:32:33,864 --> 03:32:36,765
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

2038
03:32:36,933 --> 03:32:38,867
Master.

2039
03:32:39,035 --> 03:32:41,936
Master looks after us.

2040
03:32:42,706 --> 03:32:45,504
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2041
03:32:45,675 --> 03:32:48,143
Master broke his promise.

2042
03:32:48,311 --> 03:32:50,472
Don't ask Smeagol.

2043
03:32:50,647 --> 03:32:53,844
Poor, poor Smeagol.

2044
03:32:54,017 --> 03:32:56,850
Master betrayed us.

2045
03:32:57,053 --> 03:33:00,113
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2046
03:33:00,323 --> 03:33:04,225
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

2047
03:33:04,394 --> 03:33:07,124
Kill him! Kill him!

2048
03:33:07,297 --> 03:33:08,787
Kill them both!

2049
03:33:08,965 --> 03:33:12,594
And then we take the precious...

2050
03:33:12,769 --> 03:33:16,296
and we be the master!

2051
03:33:16,973 --> 03:33:19,635
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2052
03:33:19,810 --> 03:33:22,472
Eyes always watching.

2053
03:33:22,646 --> 03:33:26,207
Then we stabs them out.

2054
03:33:26,383 --> 03:33:30,877
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

2055
03:33:31,087 --> 03:33:34,523
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2056
03:33:34,724 --> 03:33:37,420
Kill them both.

2057
03:33:37,594 --> 03:33:39,994
Yes. No! No!

2058
03:33:40,197 --> 03:33:43,894
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2059
03:33:44,601 --> 03:33:47,195
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2060
03:33:47,370 --> 03:33:49,964
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

2061
03:33:50,140 --> 03:33:55,544
We could let her do it.

2062
03:33:56,513 --> 03:34:00,643
Yes. She could do it.

2063
03:34:00,817 --> 03:34:05,379
Yes, precious, she could.

2064
03:34:05,589 --> 03:34:11,585
And then we takes it once they're dead.

2065
03:34:12,562 --> 03:34:15,395
Once they're dead.

2066
03:34:19,803 --> 03:34:23,500
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2067
03:34:23,673 --> 03:34:25,732
Smeagol will show you the way.

2068
03:34:25,909 --> 03:34:28,139
Follow me.
