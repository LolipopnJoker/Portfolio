1
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,505
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

2
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:03,962
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

3
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,470
It's a cake.

4
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:10,720
I decide what it is.

5
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,851
Looks like some kind of cake.

6
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:20,732
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...

7
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,520
Oh, God.

8
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:09,327
Boris the Animal...

9
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,367
...you've got a visitor.

10
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,911
It's just Boris.

11
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:23,754
Your letters have been
a soul-nourishing...

12
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:24,928
...tonic.

13
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,550
And you are much more...

14
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:34,269
...unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

15
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,025
This ain't a conjugal visit.

16
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,576
So quit your conjugating.

17
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:52,031
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

18
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:54,538
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

19
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:57,838
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

20
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,664
I'm a romantic like that.

21
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,388
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

22
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:08,490
Why's that?

23
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,134
Itâ€™ll ruin your figure.

24
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:57,430
You complete me.

25
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:17,330
The big one.

26
00:04:22,632 --> 00:04:24,625
Boris! You promised
to take me with you!

27
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:25,880
We had a deal!

28
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:30,255
Obadiah Price.

29
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:35,051
Yes. I did make you a promise.

30
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:46,358
Wait. I smell something.

31
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:54,122
You can't win, Boris.

32
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:56,075
Let's agree to disagree.

33
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,246
There's too many of us.

34
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:01,083
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

35
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,976
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

36
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:49,292
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

37
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:10,992
Good afternoon.

38
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:13,823
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

39
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:16,617
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical...

40
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,411
...neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

41
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:20,783
We call it the neuralyser.

42
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,250
- Keep it simple, slick.
- Thanks a lot.

43
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:24,536
Thank you, Agent K.

44
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,003
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

45
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:33,760
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

46
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:37,135
You're like, "I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane."

47
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,718
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

48
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:43,100
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and:

49
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:44,686
Just turn your damn phone off.

50
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,145
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

51
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:52,367
Check the composition
of the fuel units and surface deposits.

52
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:53,910
I wanna know who was driving.

53
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,489
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:57,870
- What are you gonna say tonight?
- Don't worry.

55
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,867
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

56
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:02,747
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- K.

57
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,590
Seriously,
I'm not even sure that's meat.

58
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:09,090
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.
Or a claw. Or a hoof.

59
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,754
Thanks, Manny.

60
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,420
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

61
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,804
What would go good with this
would be silence.

62
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,138
See, here's the problem.

63
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,473
You can't smell it...

64
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:21,729
...because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

65
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:25,942
Silence goes good with a lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

66
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,780
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

67
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,322
Let me enjoy this.

68
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,114
Whoa, enjoyment.

69
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:35,652
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

70
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,027
I keep emotion out of it.

71
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,704
Out of what, K? Life?

72
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:44,496
You don't wanna run it by me?

73
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,629
- Let me know what you'll say?
- Don't worry.

74
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,206
Oh, no, I'm worried. Very worried.

75
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,792
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

76
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,515
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

77
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,759
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

78
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,853
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

79
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,433
People will be moved.

80
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,411
And now a few words from Agent K.

81
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,834
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time...

82
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,633
...he never invited me to dinner.

83
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,552
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

84
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,806
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

85
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,227
Yeah, he was weird.

86
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,647
Thank you.

87
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,864
And now we will hear from
our new chief, Agent O.

88
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,322
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

89
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,614
- That was your eulogy?
- He was a good man.

90
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,909
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms.

91
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:07,083
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing...

92
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,497
...she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

93
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,716
And I'm paraphrasing.

94
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,359
That's just so Zed.

95
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,578
Thank you.

96
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,258
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

97
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:57,010
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

98
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,221
You know, something like:

99
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,265
"J was a friend.

100
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,436
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

101
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,939
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said...

102
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,351
...except I was too old...

103
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,319
...and craggy and surly...

104
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,777
...and just tight. I was too...

105
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,491
...tight.

106
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:20,573
I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin."

107
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,454
I'll wing something.

108
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,534
<i>K, it's O. We have reports</i>
<i>of several humans suffering from...</i>

109
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,464
<i>... intestinal worms of alien origin.</i>

110
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,663
Thank you, O.

111
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,003
How did you get to be like you?

112
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,970
Something happened, K.
What happened?

113
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,222
You know how I live
such a happy life?

114
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,258
How you live such a happy life?

115
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,355
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

116
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:49,102
That's deep.

117
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,657
Jeffrey.

118
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:05,374
Do I know you?

119
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:09,919
Your services are legendary.
So says your father, Obadiah.

120
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:11,744
You were in Lunar-Max.

121
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:15,506
There is no prison that can hold me.

122
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:19,044
Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

123
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:20,503
The device.

124
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:25,262
I'm going back in time to kill a man
before he takes my arm.

125
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:42,746
K, J!

126
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:46,449
So happy to see you.
Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

127
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,040
You no hungry?

128
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,297
Show us the tanks, Wu.

129
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:59,714
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

130
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,633
Show us the tanks in the back.

131
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:05,101
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

132
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,558
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

133
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:13,313
Hey, what you guys
wanna bust my balls for, huh?

134
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,023
You don't have no balls.

135
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:21,242
Man, you look like
you come from the planet...

136
00:12:21,411 --> 00:12:22,490
...Damn.

137
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,536
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

138
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,077
Selling unlicenced extraterrestrial...

139
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:33,661
...foodstuffs.

140
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,251
That is an Earth fish.

141
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:37,923
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me...

142
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,126
...that's a hate crime!

143
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,305
It would be...

144
00:12:40,472 --> 00:12:42,050
...if you were Chinese.

145
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:44,635
K, come on. I got larvae to feed.

146
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,973
Who is the Spiky Bulba for?

147
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:49,143
Nobody.

148
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,239
Who's it for?

149
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,399
I keep them in case!

150
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,942
- In case what?
- I don't know!

151
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,106
Anybody!

152
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,475
All right, you slug.

153
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,716
Wu...

154
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:03,324
...he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

155
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,439
Thank you, J.

156
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,491
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

157
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:10,288
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

158
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:13,877
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children, you stay.

159
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:17,582
Allow me most honourable benefit
of serving you favourite noodles, K?

160
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,633
Don't nobody want your
nasty-ass noodles.

161
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,511
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

162
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:22,889
Shrimp and bok choy.

163
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,548
We're gonna be here for a while.

164
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,028
That was just mean.

165
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:44,611
What you did to Wu back there.

166
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,613
Snatched his skirt off.

167
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,783
That's just disrespectful.

168
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,786
I used to play a game
with my dad:

169
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:54,666
What'll You Have
For Your Last Meal.

170
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,291
You could do worse than this.

171
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:00,799
Okay.

172
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,722
I played a game with my dad...

173
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,921
...called catch.

174
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,591
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall...

175
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,097
...because he wasn't there.

176
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,140
Don't badmouth your old man.

177
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:14,936
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

178
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:16,652
It's not right.

179
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,859
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

180
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,237
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three...

181
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:23,151
...just drank his fourth cup...

182
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,615
...of duck sauce.

183
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,030
<i>K, the crashed ship...</i>

184
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,916
<i>... from this morning</i>
<i>was stolen from...</i>

185
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,019
Lunar-Max.

186
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:33,999
Boris the Animal.

187
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,078
How did you know?

188
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:36,715
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.

189
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:38,414
<i>Give us a minute, chief.</i>

190
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,304
We're in a situation.

191
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,264
Oh, yeah.

192
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,433
I take the Chloropod.

193
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,715
You take the Tarantabee.

194
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:49,352
And the Hydronian over there.

195
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:50,593
I'll take the kitchen.

196
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,396
Meet you on the street.

197
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,351
This is a very confusing time...

198
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:55,806
...in my life.

199
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:16,922
Hey.

200
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,811
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

201
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:02,476
Hello, K.

202
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:06,825
Boris the Animal.

203
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,485
It's just Boris.

204
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,742
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

205
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,332
Yes, my arm.

206
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,919
We've thought about that moment...

207
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,623
...every day for the last 40 years.

208
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,841
Well, that's just not living a full life.

209
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,717
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

210
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,591
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

211
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:34,603
We'll see about that.

212
00:17:34,772 --> 00:17:38,520
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

213
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:39,807
Yo, K.

214
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,646
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fishing.

215
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:04,924
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

216
00:18:10,766 --> 00:18:12,011
You all right?

217
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:25,438
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

218
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:30,834
Thank you.

219
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,913
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie...

220
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:36,655
...from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house...

221
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:40,286
...so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

222
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:41,958
Well, this is what happens.

223
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,335
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie to your kids.

224
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:54,225
Man, I am getting too old for this.

225
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:56,719
I can only imagine how you feel.

226
00:18:56,896 --> 00:18:58,973
Boris the Animal.

227
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:02,518
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

228
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,776
Why? Was he innocent?

229
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:06,863
Should have killed him.

230
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,031
- Well, shit, let's go get him.
- No.

231
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:12,989
- No.
- Leave it alone.

232
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:14,361
It's above your pay grade.

233
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,289
We have the same pay grade.

234
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,371
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

235
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:23,502
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

236
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:27,209
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

237
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,758
You forget about Boris
or my report will reflect...

238
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,923
...that your conduct
has been unbecoming.

239
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:35,434
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reflect some shit too, K.

240
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:38,094
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit.

241
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,229
Four weeks.

242
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,484
How about I quit?

243
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:44,893
There are things out there
you don't need to know.

244
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:48,107
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

245
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,320
What up, pops?

246
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,921
- Lose your partner?
- Yeah.

247
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,758

<i>Access denied.</i>

275
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,447
What?

276
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:40,187
So why this sudden interest
in your partner's old exploits?

277
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,265
What happened between Boris and K?

278
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,436
That's easy.

279
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,564
K imprisoned Boris.
He put up the Arc Net.

280
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:48,273
He protected the Earth
from the Boglodites.

281
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:50,024
He did his job.

282
00:21:51,449 --> 00:21:52,860
That's not what I'm asking.

283
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,694
Cape Canaveral, what happened?

284
00:21:55,411 --> 00:21:57,653
Something that changed him.

285
00:21:58,164 --> 00:21:59,955
Leave it at that.

286
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,242
So you two go way back, huh?

287
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:11,501
That's classified.

288
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,253
A word of advice, Agent J.

289
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:18,049
Don't ask questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

290
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,555
That's funny.
That is exactly what K said.

291
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,484
He's a very wise man.

292
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:31,986
Take the rest of the night off.

293
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:49,757
What?

294
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:52,172

hoss.

<i>What, you're feeling chatty</i>
<i>all of a sudden?</i>

296
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:58,304
I can't talk right now. I've got secret
cases of my own I'm working on.

297
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,717
I hate to tear you away
from your video game.

298
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:02,807
All right, I'm hanging up.

You don't have to wait. Just talk.

I promised you the secrets
of the universe. Nothing more.

304
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,289
So there's secrets out there
the universe don't know about?

305
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:41,069
Mommy.

306
00:24:58,347 --> 00:24:59,889
Can I help you?

307
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:04,597
K?

308
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:06,765
5K.

309
00:25:11,027 --> 00:25:12,770
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk?

310
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,817
Can l...? I'm so sorry.
I don't know what...

311
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:19,824
Mommy, the president is drinking...

312
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:22,237
...my milk.

313
00:25:23,707 --> 00:25:24,707
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:29,917
He didn't say please.

315
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:46,385
- K get in yet?
- Who?

316
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:47,548
You new?

317
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:50,275
Very funny, Agent J.

318
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:01,195
J, everything you told me yesterday,
you were right as rain.

319
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,943
- Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout.
- Who are you?

320
00:26:04,122 --> 00:26:06,827
Exactly.
I feel like a whole new man today.

321
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,784
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life...

322
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:13,537
...but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my stepmom.

323
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:15,709
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

324
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:18,174
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

325
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:20,385
But I threw a brick
through that window.

326
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:22,430
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

327
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,265
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

328
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:30,394
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's -in-Black room...

329
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:34,101
...then we'll go find those morons
from Pox Ethera. Lunch is on me.

330
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:36,978
Who was that?

331
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:40,074
Double A? Your partner.

332
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,158
I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

333
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:48,001
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

334
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,710
Did he call in sick or anything?

335
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,336
Who's K?

336
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:54,752
All right, all right,
go ahead, go ahead.

337
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:55,924
K!

338
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:58,083
All right.

339
00:26:58,386 --> 00:26:59,761
You got me.

340
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,171
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

341
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:05,515
Oh, and all of you,
fantastic performances.

342
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:08,390
You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humour...

343
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,271
...but this is a good one.

344
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,268
But I need you
to come out here now...

345
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:14,850
...because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

346
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:17,317
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down...

347
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:19,363
...and telling me
who you're looking for?

348
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:20,648
I'm looking for K.

349
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:22,487
Who is K?

350
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,955
You too? You too.

351
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:28,080
I mean, who is he to you?

352
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,365
My partner.

353
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:32,041
Older gentleman, 110...

354
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,244
...maybe 111 years old.

355
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:38,380
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

356
00:27:39,345 --> 00:27:40,673
Seen him around?

357
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:44,676
I'll take you to K.

358
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,677
Thank you.

359
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:55,481
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's K.

360
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:57,729
He's been dead for over 40 years.

361
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:02,314
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

362
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:04,243
It's never been funny.

363
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,919
Computer, Agent K
and Boris the Animal.

364
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,792
<i>Men in Black incident report,</i>
<i>July, 1969.</i>

365
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,128
<i>Location, Cape Canaveral.</i>

366
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,672
<i>Perpetrator Boris the Animal</i>
<i>escaped and fled Earth.</i>

367
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:23,095
<i>Assumed to have returned to planet</i>
<i>Boglodotia 20 light-years away.</i>

368
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:26,598
<i>Agent K pronounced dead at scene.</i>
<i>Awarded posthumous commendation...</i>

369
00:28:26,768 --> 00:28:29,686
<i>... for action which prevented</i>
<i>greater loss of human life.</i>

370
00:28:29,854 --> 00:28:31,349
That's not what happened.

371
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,480
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away...

372
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,604
- Agent K is dead.
- Well, I just talked to him last night.

373
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,189
- You are imagining.
- I'm not.

374
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,320
- I need a psych team up here.
- Yes, ma'am.

375
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,322
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

376
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:49,037
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

377
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,247
Every morning with his coffee...

378
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:55,036
...he'd say, "I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."

379
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:57,419
And I was supposed to say,
"What do you expect?

380
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,737
- It was ground this morning."
- "This morning."

381
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,254
How do you know that?

382
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,792
Chocolate milk, sir?

383
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:06,470
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

384
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,014
Wait.

385
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,848
How long have you been craving
chocolatised dairy products?

386
00:29:12,023 --> 00:29:13,398
Just today.

387
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,189
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

388
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,854
Loss of balance?

389
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,523
Agitation? Depression?

390
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,860
Hell, yeah.

391
00:29:22,366 --> 00:29:24,608
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten...

392
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:26,280
...by a Hovartian brain tick...

393
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:28,909
...and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

394
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,328
Damn it. It's not the tick.

395
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:35,460
"Damn it, it's not the tick"?

396
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,290
It's something worse than the tick?

397
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,959
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates...

398
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:44,709
...that you might be involved
in a temporal fracture.

399
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,722
I don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:49,298
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

401
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,139
What's a temporal fracture?

402
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:52,312
A break in the timeline.

403
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Don't know what you mean.

404
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:55,433
Time travel! Time travel.

405
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,809
There's no such thing
as time travel.

406
00:29:58,194 --> 00:29:59,653
- Well, there is.
- No.

407
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,900
There's not.

408
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:02,482
Because if there were...

409
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:05,652
...a class one senior agent
such as myself...

410
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:08,365
...would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

411
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:11,076
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

412
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:13,455
You know, I need a raise.

413
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,208
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price.

414
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,416
He figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal...

415
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:23,133
...throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

416
00:30:23,428 --> 00:30:26,050
No... That's where Boris
was locked up.

417
00:30:28,517 --> 00:30:30,308
If Boris worked out
how to time jump...

418
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:33,182
...he could seriously change
the course of history.

419
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:36,561
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Early warning system engaged.</i>

420
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:39,688
<i>Inbound hostile warships</i>
<i>entering solar system.</i>

421
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:41,901
<i>Boglodite markings</i>
<i>and language detected.</i>

422
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:45,523
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

423
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,981
Apparently not.

424
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,114
<i>Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.</i>

425
00:30:50,706 --> 00:30:51,986
Put up the Arc Net.

426
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,864
- The what?
- The Arc Net. The defence system.

427
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,703
K got it for the Boglodites.

428
00:30:57,963 --> 00:30:59,457
There is no K.

429
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:01,920
He's been dead for over 40 years.

430
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:05,711
No K. No defence system.

431
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,639
Boris jumped back and killed him.

432
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,725
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

433
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:13,551
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

434
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:16,227
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

435
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:22,353
- Good luck, J!
- This planet's toast.

436
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:41,586
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale...

437
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:42,692
...on batteries.

438
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:45,213
Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or...

439
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:47,338
You helped Boris the Animal
time jump.

440
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:49,589
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

441
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:50,766
He killed my partner.

442
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:53,306
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

443
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,803
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

444
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,398
Target vector, July 16...

445
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:05,481
...1969.
- All right.

446
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,401
That's a real bummer
about your buddy.

447
00:32:07,576 --> 00:32:09,035
I'm sure he was a great guy.

448
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,242
But in terms of
the space-time continuum...

449
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:14,035
...your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

450
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:20,878
That's a big blip.

451
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,087
- Okay. What's the plan?
- You're gonna send me...

452
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:26,169
...back to July 15th, 1969.

453
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,132
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

454
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:32,177
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris...

455
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,810
...before the older one shows.

456
00:32:33,978 --> 00:32:36,433
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

457
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:39,440
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

458
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,094
No?

459
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:43,149
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

460
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,811
Oh, I just thought of something.
Even back then...

461
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,066
...New York was like a big-ish city.

462
00:32:48,242 --> 00:32:50,151
So how are you
gonna really find him?

463
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:54,788
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney Island.

464
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:57,115
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

465
00:32:57,293 --> 00:32:59,415
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

466
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:00,832
My man, for real?

467
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:02,116
Oh, right.

468
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:03,293
Sorry.

469
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:05,456
This...

470
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:08,049
...is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

471
00:33:08,263 --> 00:33:09,923
Very rare, very old.

472
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,256
But first, we gotta get high.

473
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:13,798
Hey. No.

474
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:16,641
No. No, I mean, really high.

475
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,544
Hey, man? A little help here?

476
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:45,580
Thank you.

477
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:46,759
Okay.

478
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,803
- You know the rules of time jumps?
- Give me the short version.

479
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:53,759
Okay. You wanna save your partner,
word of advice:

480
00:33:53,934 --> 00:33:55,476
Stay away from him.

481
00:33:55,644 --> 00:33:58,135
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

482
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:00,141
Now, take these.

483
00:34:00,316 --> 00:34:02,059
It gets pretty windy
on the way down.

484
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,434
The way down?

485
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:06,937
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

486
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:10,530
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveller, which is cool.

487
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,777
I am not jumping off of this building!

488
00:34:12,954 --> 00:34:14,827
Time jump.

489
00:34:16,082 --> 00:34:17,047
Okay, now...

490
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:18,832
...I gotta set this thing...

491
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:20,579
...to the 15th.

492
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,063
That seems...

493
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,956
...right-ish.

494
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:27,276
Now...

495
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:29,632
...all you gotta do is jump.

496
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:32,211
Hey, hey, stop. Stop it.

497
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,098
When you're moving fast enough...

498
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:37,801
...that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid...

499
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,722
...and it's gonna glow really bright.

500
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:42,519
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line...

501
00:34:42,692 --> 00:34:44,649
...with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

502
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,858
At this height, that should be...

503
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:49,947
Let's see, mass of Earth
and 30-something feet per minute...

504
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:52,571
It's 32 feet per second, per second.

505
00:34:52,743 --> 00:34:54,700
That sounds right-ish.

506
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,201
So that would be, I guess,
about two feet off the ground.

507
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:00,656
I break the laser line?

508
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:01,836
No, don't break it!

509
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:03,961
- No, when I'm fast enough!
- Sounds good!

510
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:07,048
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

511
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:09,210
Do not lose that time device...

512
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:13,336
...or you will be stuck in 1969!

513
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:16,350
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

514
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:20,562
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

515
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:22,273
How will I know if it works?

516
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:24,267
You'll either know...

517
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:26,777
...or you won't.

518
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:35,151
You must really love this guy
to do this.

519
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:38,365
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

520
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:44,117
- That means you were there!
- I was where?

521
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:47,255
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

522
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:48,424
Where was I?

523
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
You gotta go!

524
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:51,969
Just go, go, go!

525
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:18,027
Oh, no!

526
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:35,931
Come on!

527
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:13,691
- My man, what's today?
- Tuesday.

528
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,359
- The date?
- The 15th.

529
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,111
- Of?
- July.

530
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:19,408
- Dog, the year.
- 1969.

531
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:21,204
Thank you.

532
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,823
Look at me like I'm crazy.

533
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,344
Far out.

534
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,926
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury
like you wouldn't believe.

535
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,232
Okay, we're here.

536
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,942
- Happy?
- You're such a pill, Fred.

537
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,605
- Get us checked in.
- Yeah, yeah.

538
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,492
Hey. Hey, do me a favour, all right?

539
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:00,867
- Be careful with the luggage.
- Absolutely, sir.

540
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,198
I paid a lot of money
for that luggage.

541
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,913
- We'll take good care...
- Last time, it got scuffed up.

542
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:10,545
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.

543
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,163
There's more in the trunk.

544
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:16,462
Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

545
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:19,555
Excuse me. Excuse me, who is that?
Who are you?

546
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,845
Let's go!

547
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:46,910
Far out, man!

548
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,837
If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.

549
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:51,583
Make love, not war.

550
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,131
I prefer to do both.

551
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:32,877
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?

552
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:36,132
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats.

553
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,426
- I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
- Yeah.

554
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:41,929
Yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

555
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:43,967
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

556
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:45,424
An individual of your...

557
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:48,521
...particular ethnic persuasion?

558
00:40:50,066 --> 00:40:52,438
Maybe he's a noted athlete.

559
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:58,028
Yes. Starting forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

560
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:00,447
- Where'd you get the car?
- And the suit?

561
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,329
I stole them both.
Car from your wife...

562
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:05,323
...suit from your grandmother.

563
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,100
Hey.

564
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,827
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

565
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:11,711
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

566
00:41:12,088 --> 00:41:13,879
- Hey, what's this?
- Probably drugs.

567
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:16,337
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer...

568
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,427
...before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

569
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:20,595
Press it.

570
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:28,602
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyser.

571
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:30,230
You're not gonna remember that.

572
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:33,150
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car...

573
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:35,606
...does not mean it's stolen.

574
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:42,148
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

575
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:46,865
I'll be done
with the car in a minute!

576
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:50,623
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

577
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:07,433
Where is the Archanan?

578
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:08,682
You are too late.

579
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:11,517
He is going to give the humans...

580
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,690
...the Arc Net.

581
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:16,477
Let's agree to disagree.

582
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,597
We'll take it from here.

583
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,396
K?

584
00:42:52,023 --> 00:42:54,063
K! K!

585
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,999
Dad, I'm on Earth.

586
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:13,793
I need bail.

587
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:26,340
<i>Will the owner of a blue</i>
<i>warp-speed cruiser...</i>

588
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,924
<i>... please report to the front desk.</i>

589
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:36,440
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

590
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:38,768
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.

591
00:43:38,945 --> 00:43:40,060
How do you know my name?

592
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:44,400
What? Because I called you "K"?

593
00:43:45,077 --> 00:43:46,702
No, I call everybody K.

594
00:43:47,246 --> 00:43:48,621
It's kind of my thing.

595
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:49,952
What up, K?

596
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:51,406
All right, I sort of...

597
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:56,835
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just... Some people like it.

598
00:43:57,006 --> 00:43:59,129
Most people.

599
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:00,919
Now that I know what you look like...

600
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,718
...when you're lying, show me...

601
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:05,259
...what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

602
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,636
I won those at Coney Island
on the ring toss.

603
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:11,223
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

604
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,264
Must be good, slick.

605
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:16,144
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

606
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:18,475
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way...

607
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:21,274
...is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

608
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:24,448
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

609
00:44:24,617 --> 00:44:25,617
What's her name?

610
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,358
Your gal, what's her name?

611
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:31,283
Schtaron.

612
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,168
Schtaron?

613
00:44:39,466 --> 00:44:41,874
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours.

614
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:44,712
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

615
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:47,759
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

616
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:50,382
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be with you.

617
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,724
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

618
00:44:54,898 --> 00:44:56,392
Thanks for the heads-up.

619
00:44:57,985 --> 00:45:00,772
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

620
00:45:00,946 --> 00:45:03,698
- What do you expect? It was...
- Just ground this morning.

621
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:05,658
O?

622
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:11,620
No, I call ladies "O."

623
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,826
To me, O is feminine,
K is masculine.

624
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:19,498
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."

625
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:22,045
What a mess. Any casualties?

626
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:24,133
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

627
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:26,544
Any human casualties?

628
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,840
No, sir.

629
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,130
Who the hell is this?

630
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,722
Look, I was...

631
00:45:32,894 --> 00:45:35,895
- Stray human caught in the net.
- Code 43 him and throw him back.

632
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:38,141
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

633
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,440
They have a revolutionary new pill.

634
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:41,774
It's really...

635
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:44,652
Okay, slick.

636
00:45:47,368 --> 00:45:48,613
I was waiting for my girl.

637
00:45:48,786 --> 00:45:49,818
Schtaron.

638
00:45:49,996 --> 00:45:52,665
Yes, she's Greek.

639
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:58,169
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam.

640
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:06,386
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyser!

641
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:09,721
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

642
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:11,266
I see what you're saying.

643
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:13,808
You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

644
00:46:13,978 --> 00:46:15,176
K!

645
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,724
Let's get this bite guard in here.

646
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:19,642
Hey, back up, back up.

647
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:23,570
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

648
00:46:23,738 --> 00:46:26,063
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

649
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,948
Don't put me in here, K!

650
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,280
Too late, hoss.

651
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:32,453
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

652
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:34,743
K!

653
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,291
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

654
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,290
I'll just use my imagination.

655
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,759
K, the killer...

656
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,590
...you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy. A Boglodite.

657
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,794
His name is Boris.

658
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,087
Ship has sailed, amigo.

659
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,009
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

660
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,094
You had my undivided attention.

661
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,384
One will have one arm...

662
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,270
...and one's gonna have two. K!

663
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,768
Listen to me!

664
00:46:58,941 --> 00:46:59,941
If you erase me...

665
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,312
...you erase the world!

666
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,274
<i>Fifteen seconds...</i>

667
00:47:04,374 --> 00:47:06,569
<i>... to neuralysation. Fourteen.</i>

668
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,405
<i>Thirteen. Twelve.</i>

669
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,494
<i>Eleven. Ten. Nine.</i>

670
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:17,574
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

671
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,795
<i>Four. Three. Two.</i>

672
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:31,218
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

673
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,716
It's whirring and buzzing.

674
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,850
I don't know if I don't know nothing.

675
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,228
I knew Roman.

676
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,279
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant...

677
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:46,941
...he was my friend.

678
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,112
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

679
00:47:55,332 --> 00:47:56,332
I'm an agent...

680
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,082
...from the future. We're partners.

681
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,911
In 25 years, you'll recruit me...

682
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,171
...and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today...

683
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,332
...escapes from prison,
jumps to the past...

684
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:09,174
...and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him...

685
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:12,015
...so, really, we need to go right now.

686
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,023
All right.

687
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,189
So that's the story you believe.

688
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:29,396
That one was the truth.

689
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,650
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

690
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,947
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

691
00:48:35,122 --> 00:48:38,326
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself...

692
00:48:42,296 --> 00:48:43,874
Agent K.

693
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:45,745
What's he still doing here?

694
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:48,754
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

695
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:50,755
I put my pants on.

696
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:57,971
Okay, future man, where to?

697
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,559
I don't know.

698
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:01,731
What do you mean?

699
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:07,769
I don't know.
Go wherever you went last time.

700
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:10,354
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

701
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:13,943
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

702
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,286
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

703
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:23,044
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

704
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:24,243
It's dysfunctional.

705
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:28,585
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

706
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,298
Man...

707
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,601
There was something in the file
about a factory.

708
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,928
Something happened at a factory.

709
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,772
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

710
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:47,189
That's all I got.

711
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:53,613
That spark something?

712
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,496
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

713
00:49:58,999 --> 00:49:59,943
It's a matchbook.

714
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:01,702
No, it's a clue.

715
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:03,543
He didn't smoke.

716
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:35,110
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

717
00:50:35,495 --> 00:50:36,870
No.

718
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:39,327
Hey, man, how old are you?

719
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,039
Twenty-nine.

720
00:50:43,962 --> 00:50:45,456
You got some city miles on you.

721
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:49,256
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

722
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,845
- How well do you know this place?
- I know its reputation.

723
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,975
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

724
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:05,391
Sure thing, slick.

725
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:07,974
K! Wait, no, I gotta go in
with you!

726
00:51:08,236 --> 00:51:09,944
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

727
00:51:10,113 --> 00:51:12,271
Wait, no! No!

728
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:13,413
K!

729
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:16,112
K, don't go in by yourself!

730
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:19,788
Hi, fellas.

731
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:23,333
Need to see the boss.

732
00:51:23,668 --> 00:51:24,831
He's busy.

733
00:51:26,004 --> 00:51:28,044
Well, I'm gonna just
take a look around.

734
00:51:33,762 --> 00:51:36,170
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

735
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:38,305
Looks that way.

736
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:45,438
- Still keep the key under the ashtray.
- Lucky guess.

737
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:47,150
Now, where were we?

738
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:49,191
I was about to tell you to screw off.

739
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:51,235
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?

740
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:53,563
MiB league champ,
three years running.

741
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,401
Well, let's see it.

742
00:51:56,368 --> 00:51:57,613
You did not walk into my...

743
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:59,578
...establishment
and rip my head off!

744
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:03,246
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

745
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:05,077
I'll tell him this!

746
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,252
All right, your head.

747
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,418
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down...

748
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:11,753
...and make sure you...

749
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:13,420
...walk funny for the rest...

750
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:15,670
...of your miserable last days
on Earth!

751
00:52:16,764 --> 00:52:17,764
Tough spare, slick.

752
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:19,176
You messed with the wrong head!

753
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,508
- His head's a little...
- You gonna tell us...

754
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:23,179
...where Dom is?

755
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:25,643
I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!

756
00:52:27,984 --> 00:52:30,226
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

757
00:52:30,403 --> 00:52:32,028
- Sure thing.
- No, no, no.

758
00:52:32,697 --> 00:52:35,947
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

759
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:37,398
No cleaning! No cleaning!

760
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:41,575
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

761
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:44,321
But he's not gonna talk
to Men in Black scum like you.

762
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:46,161
Now give me back my head.

763
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:49,707
K, I call this one
"Low Hanging Fruit."

764
00:52:49,923 --> 00:52:51,168
That ain't a finger hole...

765
00:52:51,341 --> 00:52:53,049
...you sick bastard!

766
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:54,380
I'll pop your head off...

767
00:52:54,552 --> 00:52:55,928
...and see how you like it.

768
00:52:58,556 --> 00:52:59,801
I'm gonna kill both of you!

769
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:02,264
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

770
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:03,930
I'll kill you both!

771
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,394
- Well, we're on the right track.
- Just the wrong train.

772
00:53:10,777 --> 00:53:12,105
If he had any secrets...

773
00:53:12,278 --> 00:53:13,773
...Iâ€™m guessing he spilled them.

774
00:53:13,947 --> 00:53:16,319
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

775
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:17,985
A smart man would.

776
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:19,570
That's a big-ass phone.

777
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,824
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O.

778
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:25,406
How's your day been, Agent K?

779
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:26,699
Fair to middling.

780
00:53:26,877 --> 00:53:27,877
How are things going?

781
00:53:28,045 --> 00:53:29,243
<i>Very good, thank you.</i>

782
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:31,165
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.

783
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,547
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

784
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:35,627
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

785
00:53:35,803 --> 00:53:38,508
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong...

786
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:42,299
...from the same planetary grouping?
<i>- A system in the Triangulum Galaxy...</i>

787
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:43,721
...wiped out by Boglodites.

788
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:45,093
Wasn't the third planet...?

789
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:47,014
- Glamouria?
<i>- Glamouria.</i>

790
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:49,770
Thank you, Miss O.

791
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,351
I know where Boris
is headed to next.

792
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:58,200
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

793
00:54:01,996 --> 00:54:05,032
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here and I'm gonna kill him...

794
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:07,745
...I need my gun.
- No deal.

795
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,164
I've been an agent for 14 years.

796
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:14,873
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank...

797
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,090
...but I am instructing
my junior agent...

798
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:20,179
...that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

799
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:28,606
No, no, no, space gun.

800
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:30,184
You're welcome.

801
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:32,645
I didn't say thank you.

802
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,233
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

803
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,989
I was an agent for three years...

804
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:45,203
...before I realised
all models were aliens.

805
00:54:45,374 --> 00:54:47,532
Found out the hard way.

806
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:48,883
Password?

807
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:51,498
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

808
00:54:51,672 --> 00:54:52,952
Janis Joplin.

809
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,672
Is there anybody here
who's not an alien?

810
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:10,101
Very nice.

811
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:11,889
Blink. That's good.

812
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:13,109
Look in the camera.

813
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,234
Is that Andy Warhol?

814
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:18,312
Yep.

815
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:23,571
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

816
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:26,949
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

817
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,433
Just a few...

818
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,704
...questions.

819
00:55:29,877 --> 00:55:33,044
No questions. No answers.

820
00:55:33,214 --> 00:55:34,839
Just being.

821
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:37,422
We have an urgent matter
to discuss with you...

822
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:39,420
...regarding one
of your party guests.

823
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,264
Why don't you come back...

824
00:55:42,432 --> 00:55:44,424
...next week, after the happening...

825
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,392
...has happened.

826
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,390
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

827
00:55:50,565 --> 00:55:51,763
I've got a planet to save.

828
00:55:52,692 --> 00:55:54,352
You're distressing. Everything...

829
00:55:54,527 --> 00:55:56,105
...about you upsets me.

830
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:01,989
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?

831
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,868
Agent W, your cover is safe.

832
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:05,870
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

833
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:07,014
Safe?

834
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,032
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas...

835
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,415
...Iâ€™m painting cans
and bananas for chrissakes.

836
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:14,339
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I love your work.

837
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:15,834
Oh, thank you.

838
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:17,007
Who's the dumb-ass?

839
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:20,252
How about a little
professional courtesy here?

840
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:21,709
- Dumb-ass.
- Say it again.

841
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,051
- Want me to?
- I dare you.

842
00:56:23,223 --> 00:56:24,188
Dumb-ass.

843
00:56:24,288 --> 00:56:25,843
- Agents.
- I have no problem...

844
00:56:26,018 --> 00:56:28,343
...pimp-slapping the shiznit
out of Andy Warhol.

845
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:30,021
What?

846
00:56:35,277 --> 00:56:36,522
Why are you looking at me?

847
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:41,606
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K...

848
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:44,453
...you see what information
you can get from Agent W...

849
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,826
...and I'll go case the perimeter.

850
00:56:46,997 --> 00:56:48,705
- That work for everybody?
- Go do that.

851
00:56:48,874 --> 00:56:50,333
- How about that?
- Oh, cute.

852
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,374
- Okay.
- Very nice.

853
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,953
Someone forget his nap?

854
00:57:02,805 --> 00:57:04,632
Hey, how you doing?

855
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:07,266
Chilling.

856
00:57:12,523 --> 00:57:13,488
Who's that guy?

857
00:57:13,588 --> 00:57:15,142
Don't tell me he's your new partner.

858
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:18,901
Actually, he's my old partner.
He travelled back from the future...

859
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:21,195
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

860
00:57:21,366 --> 00:57:23,157
Andy, Yoko's here.

861
00:57:23,326 --> 00:57:25,200
Yoko's here.

862
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:30,623
Tell her that I'm filming this man
eating a hamburger.

863
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,374
It's transcendent.

864
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:35,953
All right, now the pickle.

865
00:57:43,305 --> 00:57:44,715
What are you doing on my turf?

866
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,468
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.

867
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:49,179
We believe he's gonna
hit here next, a Glamourian.

868
00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:52,389
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.

869
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:54,106
He's gotta be after the Archanan.

870
00:57:54,274 --> 00:57:55,519
Archanans are extinct.

871
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:58,609
Apparently not.
One washed ashore last week.

872
00:57:58,862 --> 00:58:01,946
The whole Roswell circuit's
all abuzz about it.

873
00:58:02,282 --> 00:58:04,524
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.

874
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:06,233
His name's Griffin.

875
00:58:06,703 --> 00:58:08,779
<i>Griffin the Archanan.</i>

876
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,571
How's it going?

877
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,202
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.

878
00:58:15,379 --> 00:58:16,873
Unless we're in the future...

879
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:19,373
...where the muscle boy argues
with his girlfriend.

880
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,421
She storms off and bumps the guy
with the stuffed mushrooms...

881
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:24,671
...who dumps the tray
on the sailors on leave.

882
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:26,092
A shoving match breaks out.

883
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:29,100
They smash the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.

884
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:36,101
Or it's the future where
the pastrami sandwich I'm eating...

885
00:58:36,275 --> 00:58:37,983
...causes me gastric distress.

886
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,773
Thankfully, your friend offers
the antacids he carries...

887
00:58:40,946 --> 00:58:43,782
...in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.

888
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:46,903
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes...

889
00:58:47,078 --> 00:58:49,485
...before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids...

890
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:52,664
...so on the whole, I'd have to say
not good. I am not good.

891
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,495
But that depends.

892
00:58:58,589 --> 00:58:59,870
K!

893
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:01,581
How will we find this guy?

894
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,502
What am I, a schmuck?

895
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:04,945
He's here?

896
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:07,882
"Here" is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

897
00:59:08,057 --> 00:59:10,346
They can live in and visualise
an infinite set...

898
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:12,724
...of time-space probabilities
simultaneously.

899
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,814
Sounds like fun. Good work.

900
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:16,440
Whoa, whoa, K, K, K.

901
00:59:17,943 --> 00:59:20,232
You gotta fake my death, okay?

902
00:59:20,404 --> 00:59:22,480
I can't listen to sitar music anymore.

903
00:59:22,781 --> 00:59:25,354
All right, I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to X.

904
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:27,736
K, I can't tell
the women from the men.

905
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:29,026
May I see your watch?

906
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:30,950
Oh, it is 7: 18.

907
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:33,822
No, no, your other watch,
the one your father gave you.

908
00:59:35,711 --> 00:59:37,787
How do you know
about my father's watch?

909
00:59:41,466 --> 00:59:42,711
Oh, dear.

910
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:44,843
This is the one
where Roman is dead...

911
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:47,633
...and the gentleman at the
bowling alley. So much death.

912
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:51,257
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

913
00:59:52,144 --> 00:59:53,144
K!

914
00:59:53,353 --> 00:59:54,353
Griffin, right?

915
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:55,956
We're here...

916
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:56,989
Because of Boris.

917
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:58,353
We think he's coming...

918
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,195
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes...

919
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,070
...unless we're in the future
where he made the lights...

920
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,170
...and is about...

921
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,479
...to shoot from the door...

922
01:00:05,657 --> 01:00:06,986
...in which case we're all dead.

923
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,535
Good, that was a close one.

924
01:00:11,706 --> 01:00:13,117
K, I need a space gun.

925
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,982
The Boglodites consume
any planet in their path.

926
01:00:16,127 --> 01:00:17,407
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'

927
01:00:17,587 --> 01:00:21,419
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth...

928
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:23,714
...we can stop them.
They'll starve before...

929
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,085
...they reach the next planet.

930
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:29,045
Sixty-three seconds.

931
01:00:29,474 --> 01:00:30,802
How do we do that? Stop them?

932
01:00:31,517 --> 01:00:33,177
What?

933
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:35,643
Sorry. I have something for you.

934
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:37,972
A gift. It can protect you.

935
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:42,191
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again...

936
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:44,653
...Iâ€™ll give it to you.

937
01:00:44,864 --> 01:00:48,482
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

938
01:00:48,785 --> 01:00:50,327
What do you mean? What miracle?

939
01:00:50,495 --> 01:00:52,072
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

940
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:53,246
No, we got you.

941
01:00:53,373 --> 01:00:55,780
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

942
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:57,239
- Okay.
- Twenty seconds.

943
01:00:57,418 --> 01:00:58,352
All right.

944
01:00:58,452 --> 01:00:59,332
We got it, relax.

945
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:01,537
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric...

946
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:04,466
Fly! Find your place in the world!

947
01:01:04,634 --> 01:01:06,294
Oh, dear.

948
01:01:06,511 --> 01:01:08,420
Boris is coming through that door...

949
01:01:08,596 --> 01:01:09,541
...in 12...

950
01:01:09,641 --> 01:01:11,098
...11, 10...

951
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:12,262
Wait!

952
01:01:12,362 --> 01:01:13,803
Did you have chocolate milk?

953
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:16,062
Yes.

954
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:17,845
Cindy.

955
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,365
K!

956
01:01:20,465 --> 01:01:21,430
- Griffin!
- Got him.

957
01:01:30,411 --> 01:01:31,525
Damn it!

958
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:52,390
I'm good, I'm good.

959
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:53,756
What you got?

960
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:56,927
Damn it! We had him!

961
01:01:57,187 --> 01:01:59,061
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

962
01:01:59,857 --> 01:02:01,517
First of all, my name is J, okay?

963
01:02:01,692 --> 01:02:04,609
It's not son, it's not slick
and it damn sure ain't no Cochise.

964
01:02:04,945 --> 01:02:07,698
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time...

965
01:02:07,866 --> 01:02:09,443
...and there's an invasion coming.

966
01:02:09,617 --> 01:02:12,571
You're not really recognising
my voicial intensity.

967
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,198
But there was one guy
who could help.

968
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:18,415
Hey, Griffin! Griffin! Where's Griffin?

969
01:02:19,461 --> 01:02:21,252
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

970
01:02:21,546 --> 01:02:25,460
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's <i>no bueno.</i>

971
01:02:25,884 --> 01:02:27,082
We need pie.

972
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:29,799
- What?
- My granddaddy always said:

973
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,178
"If you got a problem
you can't solve...

974
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,507
...it helps to get out
of your head." Pie.

975
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,264
- Pie?
- Yeah.

976
01:02:36,364 --> 01:02:37,852
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

977
01:02:38,313 --> 01:02:40,602
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you know what?

978
01:02:40,774 --> 01:02:42,316
We've been doing smart stuff:

979
01:02:42,484 --> 01:02:44,642
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

980
01:02:44,903 --> 01:02:46,942
It might be time
we do something stupid.

981
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:50,062
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

982
01:02:50,241 --> 01:02:52,151
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

983
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:53,702
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

984
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:55,914
Sounds good.

985
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:26,861
Have any specials?

986
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:30,815
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes...

987
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:32,402
...and asks about specials.

988
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:35,246
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

989
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:36,955
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

990
01:03:37,123 --> 01:03:38,866
It's my last meal,
I'm gonna splurge.

991
01:03:42,378 --> 01:03:45,794
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

992
01:03:46,007 --> 01:03:48,462
What do you do in your spare time,
stretch?

993
01:03:49,552 --> 01:03:53,336
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

994
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:55,554
Pie don't work unless you let it.

995
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:57,100
I'm gonna let it.

996
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:58,643
And you say we don't talk?

997
01:03:59,312 --> 01:04:02,182
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

998
01:04:02,356 --> 01:04:06,058
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

999
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:09,898
What's up with you and O?

1000
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:12,408
Me and O?

1001
01:04:13,243 --> 01:04:14,654
Yeah, you and O.

1002
01:04:14,828 --> 01:04:16,156
All right, all right.

1003
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:18,031
All right, this is it.

1004
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:22,666
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

1005
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:23,884
Mick Jagger?

1006
01:04:23,984 --> 01:04:26,037
He was in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

1007
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,340
Rings a bell.

1008
01:04:27,466 --> 01:04:30,751
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

1009
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:34,172
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

1010
01:04:34,348 --> 01:04:38,297
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

1011
01:04:39,436 --> 01:04:42,556
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

1012
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:46,729
Warm beer and the worst food
you ever ate.

1013
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:50,645
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

1014
01:04:50,822 --> 01:04:52,530
Neither of us wanted to leave.

1015
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:04,036
What the hell happened
to you, man?

1016
01:05:04,462 --> 01:05:06,918
I don't know. It hasn't happened yet.

1017
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:11,004
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

1018
01:05:11,636 --> 01:05:12,916
I got you.

1019
01:05:13,096 --> 01:05:15,765
I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

1020
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:17,307
Total losers!

1021
01:05:17,475 --> 01:05:19,266
It's a rough time
to be a Mets fan.

1022
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:21,973
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

1023
01:05:22,313 --> 01:05:25,314
That's funny. The Mets actually
win it all this year.

1024
01:05:25,566 --> 01:05:26,895
Oh, yeah.

1025
01:05:27,151 --> 01:05:28,116
No, I'm serious.

1026
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,090
I'm sure.

1027
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,524
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there...

1028
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:33,856
...are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets...

1029
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:36,524
...and the Miracle Mets.

1030
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:40,037
What?

1031
01:05:40,206 --> 01:05:41,866
What you got there, hoss?

1032
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:47,330
The Archanan said, "It's amazing!
It's a miracle! I'll see you at the game."

1033
01:05:48,506 --> 01:05:49,881
I know where he is.

1034
01:05:50,675 --> 01:05:52,760
Told you to trust the pie.

1035
01:05:57,015 --> 01:06:00,514
If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

1036
01:06:00,686 --> 01:06:04,019
He's here. We just gotta find him
before Boris does.

1037
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,189
It's time to give you
your things back...

1038
01:06:13,365 --> 01:06:14,444
...partner.

1039
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,739
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

1040
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,069
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.

1041
01:06:20,372 --> 01:06:22,661
Come on now! All right! Let's go...

1042
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:23,818
...Mets!

1043
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:26,367
Let's go, Mets! Let's go...

1044
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:28,751
...Mets! Let's go, Met...
- Griffin?

1045
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:32,925
You're just in time!

1046
01:06:33,093 --> 01:06:37,423
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

1047
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:40,933
Are we missing something?

1048
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:42,925
The game.

1049
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:14,794
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

1050
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:18,670
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

1051
01:07:19,182 --> 01:07:21,222
This game doesn't happen
till October.

1052
01:07:21,393 --> 01:07:22,721
It's always October...

1053
01:07:22,978 --> 01:07:24,555
...and November and March.

1054
01:07:24,729 --> 01:07:27,730
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

1055
01:07:27,899 --> 01:07:29,690
Until then, they're all happening.

1056
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:32,813
Like this one, it's my favourite moment
in human history.

1057
01:07:32,988 --> 01:07:36,357
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

1058
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:39,699
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

1059
01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:41,150
You said you had a gift.

1060
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:42,304
That baseball...

1061
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:46,245
...thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding...

1062
01:07:46,418 --> 01:07:49,869
...of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically flawed...

1063
01:07:50,046 --> 01:07:52,371
...due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned...

1064
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:54,376
...because the tanner's wife
left him...

1065
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:56,045
...for a Puerto Rican golf pro...

1066
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:57,714
The gift?

1067
01:07:57,888 --> 01:08:00,130
Oh, yes, of course. In the box.

1068
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:06,980
It's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

1069
01:08:07,148 --> 01:08:08,148
It's a shield.

1070
01:08:12,737 --> 01:08:13,737
Shield.

1071
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:17,485
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

1072
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,402
- How?
- When that ball is pitched to...

1073
01:08:19,577 --> 01:08:20,552
...Davey Johnson...

1074
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:21,776
<i>... who became a player...</i>

1075
01:08:21,954 --> 01:08:25,406
<i>... because his dad couldn't find a
<i>football to give him for his birthday...</i>

1076
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:26,537
<i>... it hits...</i>

1077
01:08:26,637 --> 01:08:28,458
<i>... his bat two micrometers</i>
<i>too high...</i>

1078
01:08:28,627 --> 01:08:29,956
<i>... popping out to Cleon Jones...</i>

1079
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:33,038
<i>... who would've been born Clara,</i>
<i>a statistical...</i>

1080
01:08:33,257 --> 01:08:36,708
<i>... typist, if his parents didn't have</i>
<i>an extra glass of wine that night...</i>

1081
01:08:36,886 --> 01:08:38,759
<i>... before going to bed.</i>

1082
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:41,010
<i>A miracle...</i>

1083
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,589
...is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

1084
01:08:53,027 --> 01:08:54,486
I lost my planet.

1085
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:57,068
I don't want you to lose yours.

1086
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,731
It'll take a miracle,
but if you pull this off...

1087
01:08:59,951 --> 01:09:01,944
...you'll be my new
favourite moment...

1088
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,947
...in human history.

1089
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:05,581
Oh, dear.

1090
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,665
I forgot to see this one coming.

1091
01:09:14,758 --> 01:09:15,837
Damn it!

1092
01:09:26,019 --> 01:09:27,182
Have these in the future?

1093
01:09:27,354 --> 01:09:28,433
No.

1094
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:29,689
Get on.

1095
01:09:33,443 --> 01:09:35,436
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.

1096
01:09:35,612 --> 01:09:38,186
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the centre stalk...

1097
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:39,740
...between 80 and 100 psi.

1098
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:41,242
I didn't understand...

1099
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,820
...any of that!

1100
01:09:42,995 --> 01:09:45,071
- Gyro at zero gain.
- It is.

1101
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,619
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the centre stalk.

1102
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:48,725
I did!

1103
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:50,582
Between 80 and 100 psi!

1104
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:52,659
Got it.

1105
01:09:55,299 --> 01:09:57,173
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

1106
01:09:57,343 --> 01:09:59,217
This isn't the one where you get it!

1107
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,463
- All right there, chief?
- Hell, yeah.

1108
01:10:01,639 --> 01:10:03,181
It'd be better with four wheels!

1109
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:04,678
Two is, like, my minimum.

1110
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,063
What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

1111
01:10:14,235 --> 01:10:16,477
Boglodite invasion,
total destruction of Earth!

1112
01:10:40,678 --> 01:10:42,386
The box!

1113
01:10:53,609 --> 01:10:54,854
Good boy.

1114
01:10:55,277 --> 01:10:56,771
We gotta stop this guy!

1115
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,027
I've been trying!

1116
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,444
You haven't been trying?

1117
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:02,967
Hey, slick.

1118
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:06,030
In the future,
we ever do the Texas two-step?

1119
01:11:06,205 --> 01:11:07,865
Yes, sir!

1120
01:11:33,315 --> 01:11:34,315
Did you get him?

1121
01:11:34,608 --> 01:11:36,067
Give me a sec.

1122
01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:41,489
Is he dead?

1123
01:11:41,824 --> 01:11:43,199
Negative.

1124
01:11:44,076 --> 01:11:45,274
He got away.

1125
01:11:47,746 --> 01:11:49,573
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

1126
01:12:04,347 --> 01:12:06,423
I feel younger already.

1127
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:36,083
You pathetic waste
of Boglodite flesh.

1128
01:12:36,254 --> 01:12:39,540
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

1129
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,591
- Who are you?
- Look at you.

1130
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,796
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

1131
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:46,134
What happened to my arm?

1132
01:12:46,306 --> 01:12:48,549
You lose it, shot off by a human.

1133
01:12:48,726 --> 01:12:50,185
No human could defeat me.

1134
01:12:50,561 --> 01:12:54,808
You spend the next 40 years in prison,
chained up like an animal.

1135
01:12:54,982 --> 01:12:56,856
No prison can hold me!

1136
01:12:57,026 --> 01:12:59,731
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

1137
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:01,862
No human has been to the moon...

1138
01:13:02,031 --> 01:13:04,700
...so they cannot have
built it there already.

1139
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:07,868
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

1140
01:13:08,037 --> 01:13:11,655
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

1141
01:13:11,832 --> 01:13:14,620
That wasn't me, that was you!

1142
01:13:19,924 --> 01:13:20,924
What's your plan?

1143
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:23,333
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

1144
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:26,049
- Kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan.

1145
01:13:26,555 --> 01:13:27,555
Didn't work.

1146
01:13:27,682 --> 01:13:28,682
With my help...

1147
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:31,762
...we'll get the Arc Net,
kill Agent K...

1148
01:13:31,936 --> 01:13:34,225
...the invasion will be successful...

1149
01:13:34,438 --> 01:13:35,980
...and we'll get to keep both...

1150
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:38,521
...of our ar...! Stop...

1151
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:40,187
...staring at it!

1152
01:13:41,112 --> 01:13:42,191
Listen.

1153
01:13:57,546 --> 01:14:00,796
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

1154
01:14:01,091 --> 01:14:02,091
It's what we do.

1155
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:04,338
You still have the Arc Net?

1156
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:08,713
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal...

1157
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:10,598
...you get good at hiding things.

1158
01:14:36,001 --> 01:14:38,077
This will save your world.

1159
01:14:41,006 --> 01:14:43,164
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets...

1160
01:14:43,342 --> 01:14:44,622
...a whole lot bigger.

1161
01:14:45,845 --> 01:14:47,672
All you have to do is deploy it.

1162
01:14:48,765 --> 01:14:52,181
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

1163
01:14:52,352 --> 01:14:55,021
It's just one small step.

1164
01:15:09,535 --> 01:15:10,567
The moon launch.

1165
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,700
Cape Canaveral.

1166
01:15:17,043 --> 01:15:19,913
July 16th, 1969.

1167
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:21,874
We got six hours to get to Florida.

1168
01:15:22,215 --> 01:15:23,590
Better get a move on, slick.

1169
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:24,883
Wait, hold up.

1170
01:15:25,009 --> 01:15:27,132
Not us.
I'm gonna do this one alone.

1171
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:28,299
He has to be the...

1172
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,377
Griffin.

1173
01:15:29,477 --> 01:15:30,545
What do you mean, alone?

1174
01:15:31,307 --> 01:15:33,181
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

1175
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:34,596
I need you to trust me.

1176
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:38,761
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

1177
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,399
You're not going to Florida.

1178
01:15:40,566 --> 01:15:42,310
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

1179
01:15:42,485 --> 01:15:43,861
Look, K...

1180
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:46,693
...please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

1181
01:15:48,826 --> 01:15:49,826
Stop me.

1182
01:15:54,748 --> 01:15:56,159
You die there!

1183
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:02,003
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

1184
01:16:03,924 --> 01:16:05,751
Boris kills you there.

1185
01:16:08,178 --> 01:16:09,721
That's what I'm here for.

1186
01:16:10,347 --> 01:16:11,841
That's what I came back to stop.

1187
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:14,014
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

1188
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:17,353
K...

1189
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:20,186
...I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

1190
01:16:20,357 --> 01:16:21,597
I said I told you everything...

1191
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:24,736
That's for lying to me.

1192
01:16:24,987 --> 01:16:26,018
Look, I'm sorry, man!

1193
01:16:29,116 --> 01:16:30,824
That's for telling me the truth!

1194
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:33,993
I'm trying to protect you...

1195
01:16:35,205 --> 01:16:36,664
...man!

1196
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:41,379
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

1197
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,960
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

1198
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,887
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

1199
01:16:50,055 --> 01:16:51,549
There's no other way.

1200
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,307
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

1201
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,686
Can I save him?

1202
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:02,347
Is there any future
where I save his life?

1203
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,611
Yes.

1204
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,362
But where there is death...

1205
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,733
...there will always be death.

1206
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:33,423
According to you,
I've done this before.

1207
01:17:33,598 --> 01:17:35,009
So we know it's possible.

1208
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,140
If you're half the agent
you say you are...

1209
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:39,600
...you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

1210
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:45,983
So are we partners? You tell me.

1211
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,442
Let's go.

1212
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:04,542
Agent K...

1213
01:18:04,642 --> 01:18:06,041
...how are you?
- I'm good.

1214
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:09,382
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

1215
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:13,763
<i>This morning, man is about to launch</i>
<i>himself on a trip to the moon...</i>

1216
01:18:13,931 --> 01:18:16,422
<i>... with the expectation</i>
<i>of landing there.</i>

1217
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,059
Look, I gotta ask you.

1218
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,599
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were...

1219
01:18:20,771 --> 01:18:22,563
...O and I, are we?

1220
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:23,930
A wise man once told me...

1221
01:18:24,108 --> 01:18:26,895
...don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

1222
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:30,906
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

1223
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:37,037
Here they are.

1224
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:40,037
- What are they?
- Jetpacks.

1225
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,751
Jetpacks?

1226
01:18:42,836 --> 01:18:45,588
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

1227
01:18:45,756 --> 01:18:48,081
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

1228
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:49,258
K, we gotta drive.

1229
01:18:49,676 --> 01:18:52,630
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

1230
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:56,844
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

1231
01:18:57,017 --> 01:18:58,891
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

1232
01:18:59,061 --> 01:19:00,852
No red buttons yet, slick.

1233
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:04,729
Come on, man.

1234
01:19:09,821 --> 01:19:10,796
Do you know...

1235
01:19:10,896 --> 01:19:12,103
...how to work this thing?

1236
01:19:12,282 --> 01:19:14,405
It's like with anything.

1237
01:19:14,576 --> 01:19:18,490
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

1238
01:19:19,623 --> 01:19:20,903
Isn't that right, Miss O?

1239
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,285
Unfortunately, it is.

1240
01:19:35,472 --> 01:19:36,753
You ready, slick?

1241
01:19:38,643 --> 01:19:40,185
Let's get it.

1242
01:19:40,395 --> 01:19:42,221
This is gonna be interesting!

1243
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:57,448
<i>It's just minutes to the...</i>

1244
01:19:57,662 --> 01:19:59,286
<i>... historic launch of</i> Apollo 11...

1245
01:19:59,455 --> 01:20:01,781
<i>... with all going well.</i>

1246
01:20:18,182 --> 01:20:21,349
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

1247
01:20:21,602 --> 01:20:23,310
One of the times?

1248
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:27,691
Oh, we got company.

1249
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:33,697
The hell?

1250
01:20:35,284 --> 01:20:37,241
Is that a battery belt?

1251
01:20:47,129 --> 01:20:48,671
All right, I got it.

1252
01:20:51,884 --> 01:20:54,422
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed...

1253
01:20:54,636 --> 01:20:56,380
...is one where you tell the truth.

1254
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:58,139
The truth?

1255
01:20:58,474 --> 01:21:00,466
The truth is the only path.

1256
01:21:00,684 --> 01:21:02,344
This is a restricted area!

1257
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:09,356
Yes, sir, it is.

1258
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:12,480
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

1259
01:21:12,655 --> 01:21:16,320
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

1260
01:21:16,492 --> 01:21:18,568
We're from a secret government
organisation...

1261
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:22,327
...that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

1262
01:21:23,749 --> 01:21:24,864
Here's the thing.

1263
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:27,497
We have this special
little metal thingy...

1264
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:31,454
...that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket...

1265
01:21:31,632 --> 01:21:35,251
...to prevent an alien invasion.

1266
01:21:38,682 --> 01:21:39,682
That worked.

1267
01:21:39,808 --> 01:21:42,512
- Like a charm.
- Sir, Delta Gate. We have a problem.

1268
01:21:42,852 --> 01:21:46,221
Three trespassers. No IDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

1269
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:48,598
Some kind I've never seen before.

1270
01:21:56,473 --> 01:21:58,288
What breed of fool
do you have to be...

1271
01:21:58,392 --> 01:22:00,993
...to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat...

1272
01:22:01,162 --> 01:22:02,407
...attempted by mankind?

1273
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,498
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own...

1274
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:06,782
...firstborn!
- Colonel?

1275
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:08,825
Colonel, they had these.

1276
01:22:10,005 --> 01:22:13,503
They said they needed to put
something on the rocket for an invasion.

1277
01:22:17,721 --> 01:22:18,721
Thanks.

1278
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,175
I got 10 minutes to launch.

1279
01:22:20,432 --> 01:22:24,476
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

1280
01:22:28,898 --> 01:22:30,892
I told the truth last time.

1281
01:22:35,906 --> 01:22:37,698
Sir, this man came here from...

1282
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:39,284
...the future to protect me...

1283
01:22:39,452 --> 01:22:42,868
...so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

1284
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,996
I need your help to do that.

1285
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:49,449
Take them to the brig.

1286
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:51,123
You're slipping, Griff.

1287
01:22:51,672 --> 01:22:52,835
Sir, if I may.

1288
01:23:09,106 --> 01:23:10,106
Corporal.

1289
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:12,520
You men are no longer needed.

1290
01:23:13,027 --> 01:23:14,142
I'll take the prisoners.

1291
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:16,355
- Sir, are you...?
- Dismissed.

1292
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:26,206
Follow me.

1293
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,749
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

1294
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:38,049
Only what he needed to see.

1295
01:23:39,388 --> 01:23:40,763
I have to go now.

1296
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,301
What? No, no, no. Come on.

1297
01:23:43,725 --> 01:23:45,219
You don't need me anymore.

1298
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:48,016
All right, Griff,
don't start flipping on me.

1299
01:23:48,188 --> 01:23:51,639
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

1300
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:53,774
He will not know
you were ever here.

1301
01:23:55,487 --> 01:23:59,567
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

1302
01:23:59,741 --> 01:24:02,991
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

1303
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:04,095
You coming?

1304
01:24:04,195 --> 01:24:05,988
Yeah, all right!

1305
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:10,413
Thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

1306
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:12,460
Anything's possible.

1307
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,465
Oh, Griff.

1308
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:25,255
I can never bear to watch this part.

1309
01:24:27,186 --> 01:24:28,846
<i>Armstrong and Aldrin</i>
<i>are scheduled...</i>

1310
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:30,931
<i>... to set foot on the moon...</i>

1311
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:35,057
<i>... on early Monday morning,</i>
<i>Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

1312
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:37,411
Where's Griffin?

1313
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:39,148
Doing his own thing.

1314
01:25:01,804 --> 01:25:02,804
Gentlemen.

1315
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,843
This elevator
will take you to the top.

1316
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,012
To get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere...

1317
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,190
...you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

1318
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,734
You do not want to be...

1319
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,144
...anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

1320
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:20,693
- Questions?
- No. Thank you for this, colonel.

1321
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,443
Some job you got there.

1322
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,863
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

1323
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,527
What did Griff
show you back there?

1324
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,116
How important you are.

1325
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,035
You and your partner.

1326
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,708
If everything goes right
the way we hope it does...

1327
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,638
...Iâ€™m gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick...

1328
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:47,222
...so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1329
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:50,927
If things go wrong,
not gonna have a chance to, either.

1330
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:54,523
So I guess win or lose, this is it.

1331
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,945
I see why I recruited you.

1332
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:04,905
You're a good man.

1333
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,038
Good man.

1334
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,743
Man, what the hell
happened to you?

1335
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,496
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

1336
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,053
I'll take this one!

1337
01:26:24,431 --> 01:26:25,545
Naughty.

1338
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:30,307
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

1339
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,361
And liftoff.

1340
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:25,532
<i>Just passed the two-minute mark...</i>

1341
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:29,153
<i>... in the countdown, and all is still go</i>
<i>as we monitor our status board.</i>

1342
01:27:50,476 --> 01:27:53,263
<i>Astronauts report it feels good.</i>
<i>Power transfer is complete.</i>

1343
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:57,066
<i>Neil Armstrong just reported back</i>
<i>it's been a smooth countdown.</i>

1344
01:28:09,578 --> 01:28:10,610
Hey!

1345
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:12,496
Boris, can you give me a hand?

1346
01:28:12,665 --> 01:28:14,456
Hey.

1347
01:28:19,171 --> 01:28:20,172
Hey!

1348
01:28:20,882 --> 01:28:22,507
You hear me calling you?

1349
01:28:23,385 --> 01:28:24,879
Boris the Animal!

1350
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:26,321
Hey!

1351
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:28,379
Boris the Animal!

1352
01:28:30,267 --> 01:28:32,639
It's just Boris!

1353
01:28:36,481 --> 01:28:37,513
You're gonna lose.

1354
01:28:37,816 --> 01:28:39,061
Let's agree to disagree.

1355
01:28:58,712 --> 01:28:59,875
Hey!

1356
01:29:00,922 --> 01:29:02,547
Boris the Animal!

1357
01:29:12,517 --> 01:29:13,517
Right.

1358
01:29:14,144 --> 01:29:15,144
Left.

1359
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:43,878
You're gonna lose.

1360
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:46,006
Let's agree to disagree.

1361
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:56,269
Hey!

1362
01:29:56,979 --> 01:29:58,771
Boris the Animal!

1363
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:06,693
Right.

1364
01:30:06,793 --> 01:30:08,323
Left. Left.

1365
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:10,409
Right.

1366
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:16,204
That's not possible.

1367
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,409
Let's agree to disagree.

1368
01:30:24,133 --> 01:30:26,802
That's not possible!

1369
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:37,103
K!

1370
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:41,098
I win! I'm better than me!

1371
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:49,777
That's my partner.

1372
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:52,069
That's my partner!

1373
01:30:58,292 --> 01:30:59,323
If we call this in...

1374
01:30:59,501 --> 01:31:02,171
...they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything.

1375
01:31:36,873 --> 01:31:38,747
- Where's your partner?
- He went home.

1376
01:31:38,917 --> 01:31:40,411
- How does that work?
- You got me.

1377
01:31:40,585 --> 01:31:41,866
Come on!

1378
01:31:56,726 --> 01:31:57,726
Get down!

1379
01:32:28,592 --> 01:32:29,921
Bingo.

1380
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:32,921
Man, that is some next-level stuff.

1381
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,269
You ever want to see more...

1382
01:32:44,483 --> 01:32:47,769
...I know a top-secret organisation
that could use a man like you.

1383
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:51,357
I wish I could.

1384
01:32:51,949 --> 01:32:52,949
Thank you.

1385
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,408
I'll see you around, K.

1386
01:32:57,163 --> 01:32:58,163
Look out!

1387
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:04,787
Go ahead.

1388
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,789
Arrest me.

1389
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:10,042
Not this time.

1390
01:33:20,062 --> 01:33:23,062
"Where there's death,
there will always be death."

1391
01:33:32,407 --> 01:33:35,657
Daddy! Daddy!

1392
01:33:39,748 --> 01:33:40,748
Hey.

1393
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,540
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

1394
01:33:44,086 --> 01:33:45,117
James.

1395
01:33:45,295 --> 01:33:47,833
James? That's a nice name.

1396
01:33:48,048 --> 01:33:49,376
Where's my dad?

1397
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:54,134
What have you got there?
What is that?

1398
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,679
My dad gave it to me.

1399
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:58,089
We timed the launch.

1400
01:34:05,232 --> 01:34:07,023
Where is my daddy?

1401
01:34:11,114 --> 01:34:12,524
He...

1402
01:34:13,116 --> 01:34:16,864
He went to go do something
very special.

1403
01:34:17,036 --> 01:34:18,910
And he wanted me...

1404
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:23,409
...to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

1405
01:34:28,297 --> 01:34:30,456
When is he gonna be back?

1406
01:34:31,634 --> 01:34:33,009
He...

1407
01:34:47,817 --> 01:34:49,276
James...

1408
01:34:50,653 --> 01:34:52,445
...if you look right here...

1409
01:34:52,613 --> 01:34:55,817
...I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

1410
01:35:01,331 --> 01:35:03,122
Your daddy is a hero.

1411
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:05,788
My daddy is a hero?

1412
01:35:09,006 --> 01:35:12,291
- Want to take a walk with me?
- Yes.

1413
01:35:21,852 --> 01:35:23,132
James?

1414
01:36:05,521 --> 01:36:07,182
You're late.

1415
01:36:07,357 --> 01:36:09,599
Sorry. Lost track of time.

1416
01:36:11,569 --> 01:36:12,767
How do you know that song?

1417
01:36:13,154 --> 01:36:15,194
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

1418
01:36:16,074 --> 01:36:17,865
What do you know
and what do you don't?

1419
01:36:18,034 --> 01:36:19,742
How do I know what I don't know?

1420
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:22,829
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

1421
01:36:22,997 --> 01:36:23,993
Yeah.

1422
01:36:24,093 --> 01:36:25,071
Boglodites?

1423
01:36:25,171 --> 01:36:26,153
Extinct for 40 years.

1424
01:36:26,334 --> 01:36:28,576
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

1425
01:36:28,753 --> 01:36:29,998
You hung up on me.

1426
01:36:30,422 --> 01:36:32,046
Yeah, I did.

1427
01:36:33,091 --> 01:36:35,249
But that was because
of all those secrets...

1428
01:36:35,802 --> 01:36:38,719
...the universe doesn't know about.

1429
01:36:43,435 --> 01:36:44,435
But...

1430
01:36:44,602 --> 01:36:46,394
...Iâ€™ve realised that...

1431
01:36:46,563 --> 01:36:49,054
...last night was a long...

1432
01:36:49,232 --> 01:36:51,521
...long time ago.

1433
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:58,532
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

1434
01:36:59,117 --> 01:37:01,110
It's been my privilege.

1435
01:37:10,963 --> 01:37:13,371
You know, there's a really
high possibility now...

1436
01:37:13,549 --> 01:37:16,122
...that I might know some things
you don't know.

1437
01:37:16,302 --> 01:37:17,879
I doubt it.

1438
01:37:18,054 --> 01:37:20,011
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

1439
01:37:20,181 --> 01:37:22,090
She's a fine lady,
but you know the rules.

1440
01:37:22,266 --> 01:37:24,425
There's no fraternising
amongst agents.

1441
01:37:24,602 --> 01:37:27,307
I think y'all might have fraternised
a time or two.

1442
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:33,816
This is my new favourite moment
in human history.

1443
01:37:33,986 --> 01:37:37,236
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

1444
01:37:51,837 --> 01:37:53,246
Almost forgot.

1445
01:38:02,265 --> 01:38:03,906
That was a close one.
