Give me the Black Beauty.

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,327
Alvin, take it easy out there.
You gotta share the spotlight.

25
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,037
You got it, Dave.

Alvin!

-I'm serious, Alvin.

28
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,709
This is a charity benefit.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,670
It's not all about you.

30
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,882
Sorry, Dave, I can't hear you over the
thousands of fans screaming my name.

32

Yeah!

35
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,726
A little help, boys.

00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,688

37
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,026

Alvin, will you please
get down from there?

41
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,584
I can't hear you.

42
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,919
Alvin,
I'm not kidding!

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,588
What? Whoa, whoa.

00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,797

45
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,509
Dave! Look out!

46
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,970
Huh?

Alvin!

Oh, Dave!

Dave?

MALE DOCTOR:
This should help with the pain.

53
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,988
I wanna talk to my boys.

54
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,200
Well, I just gave you a sedative

55
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,243
that will take effect
in about one minute.

56
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,121
So, uh... well,
let them in quickly.

57
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:29,959
-Dave!
-Dave!

58
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,002
Dave, you're alive!

59
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,754
-DAVE: Hey, guys.
-It was an accident!

60
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,297
-I swear!
-Are you okay?

61
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,007
I'm really sorry, Dave.

62
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,091
I'll be fine.

63
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,801
I'm just gonna be stuck here for a while.

64
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,512
Uh, and... and until I get out,

65
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,348
I've made arrangements for my Aunt Jackie

66
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,682
to come stay with you.

67
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,725
Who's Aunt Jackie?

68
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,477
The one who sends us those metal buckets

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,229
of yummy popcorn for Christmas.

70
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,939
Oh, Popcorn Jackie.

71
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,398
You don't have much time, Mr. Seville.

72
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,816
Uh, now listen.

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,736
I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.

74
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,905
(sighs)

75
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,199
I've even made arrangements...

76
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,992
for you to go to school.

77
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,327
ALL:
School?

78
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes, school.

79
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,123
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

80
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,375
You are?

81
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,837
I'm... counting on... you.

82
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,507
Dave!
Wait a minute! Why is he in charge?

83
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,717
Whoa, he's counting on me.

84
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,636
Dave, please don't die.

85
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,263
He's just sleeping.
He's had a sedative.

86
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,015
Oh, a sedative.

87
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,519
Excuse me.
I'm here to escort the chipmunks home.

88
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,979
We're not leaving Dave!

89
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,814
I'm putting my paw down on this one!

90
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,607
You come here!

91
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,566
(mechanical whirring)

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,319
(chipmunks screaming)

93
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,320
I got it.
I'll fix it.

94
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,239
Nope, made it worse.

95
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,116
-Please, please, go.
-Oh, this must be it.

96
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,075
Uh-oh.

97
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,578
More stress you put on Monsieur Seville,
the longer it will take him to recover!

98
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,913
Whoa! Uh-uh!

99
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,832
You are too slow for me, nurse.

100
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,667
-DOCTOR: No, don't.
-You'll never take me!

101
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,003
I'm not going anywhere
without Da...

102
00:04:55,086 --> 00:05:00,216
<i>♪ Daydream believer</i>

103
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,261
(snoring)

104
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,723
I hope for your sake
he stays asleep for the entire flight.

105
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,100
Maybe we should give him
another shot.

106
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,476
Just to be sure.

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,561
(gasps)
Ugh.

108
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,987
(sniffing)

109
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,197
Any ideas on how we find Aunt Jackie?

110
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,533
Got it! Follow me!

111
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,745
Excuse me. Ooh, sorry.

112
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,496
Ooh, excuse me.

113
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,497
Coming through.

114
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,583
Look! Aunt Jackie!

115
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,709
(chuckling)
Oh, yeah.

116
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,461
-Aunt Jackie!
-Popcorn Jackie!

117
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,837
Oh, hello, dears!

118
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,339
-Cool wheelchair.
-Yay, we found you!

119
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,883
Popcorn!
Where's Simon and Theodore's?

120
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,094
Oh, there's plenty for everyone.
Let's have a hug first.

121
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,181
-Oh.
-Get over here,you old teddy bear.

122
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm not really much of a hugger.

123
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,642
Oh, boys,

124
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,935
I want you to meet someone.

125
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,188
This is my grandson, Toby. Toby...

126
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,522
Hi, I'm Theodore.

127
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,815
Toby.

128
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,150
Ah! What? What happened?

129
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,318
-What?
-The boys.

130
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,569
-Oh, hey. Hey.
-Hi.

131
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,946
How are ya?
I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

132
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,573
Toby's living with me till he figures out

133
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,241
what he wants to do with his life.

134
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,953
So far that means going, "pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew" with his thumbs all day.

135
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,998
Well, for the record, going "pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew" with my thumbs right now

136
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,334
is keeping me in first place,
so that's important.

137
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,502
Toby, get the bags.

138
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,379
-What bags?
-The luggage. Get the luggage.

139
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,090
Uh, oh, the lug... right.
Yeah, let me get those.

140
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,091
TOBY: Oh, sorry.

141
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,386
-Toby.
-Hit the brakes!

142
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,845
-Hit the brakes!
-Abandon wheelchair!

143
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,472
AUNT JACKIE:
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

144
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,682
Tob-y-y-y.

145
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,102
Toby!

146
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,646
(sighs)
I'm fine. Don't worry.

147
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,482
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

148
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,441
(crash)

149
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,819
(chipmunks groaning)

150
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,363
I'm so sorry, Aunt Jackie!
I'm so sorry! Is she gonna be okay?

151
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,032
Don't worry about me.
I'll be home in no time.

152
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,367
-In you go.
-(groans)

153
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,368
I wouldn't be so sure.

154
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,578
Wha...

155
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,497
It was an accident.
I swear.

156
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,083
Been there, done that.

157
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,709
Several times.

158
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,711
I guess you'll be taking care of us now.

159
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,673
I'll take "frightening thoughts"
for 500 please, Alex.

160
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,592
(grunting)
Not a problem. I could totally do this.

161
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,802
I took care of my cat.

162
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,430
Until he ran away.

163
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,682
Well, "ran away"
is kind of strong wording.

164
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,350
I think he just wanted his space.

165
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,102
I still see him around the neighborhood.

166
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,939
You know, he like, uh,
hisses and claws at me,

167
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,900
but I think that's just his way
of saying we're still tight, you know?

168
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,862
You guys have nothing
to worry about, seriously,

169
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,989
'cause I'm not gonna
be like Dave. You know, Dave's gone.

170
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,575
Gone?

171
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,035
Not "gone."
Not "gone" gone. He's... he's not dead.

172
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,204
He's very much alive.
He's completely coming back.

173
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm just gonna be in his room
keeping his bed warm.

174
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,250
I'm gonna be doing my thing.
You'll be doing your thing.

175
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,710
You're not even gonna know I'm there.

176
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,879
Uh, we're supposed to know you're there.

177
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,047
That's, uh, that's the whole idea.

178
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,468
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.
You'll know that I'm there.

179
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,428
I'm just saying
I'm not gonna be like,

180
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,431
"I know everything.
And you do this and you do that."

181
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,057
Like my dad.

182
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,979
-All right. Let's do this.
-(engine starts)

183
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,064
Oh, boy.

184
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,943
-(tires squealing and screeching)
-(clattering)

185
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,237
(tires squealing)

186
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,701
SIMON: Theodore, we're gonna be just fine.

187
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:18,164
The important thing is
we're all... still alive.

188
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:22,293
Well, maybe my "Get Well"
card will help Dave get home faster.

189
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,087
Um, it needs just a touch more glitter.

190
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,302
Yep, that should do it.

191
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,762
Who's hungry?

192
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,680
Ooh, ooh, me, me, me, me!

193
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,681
Let's eat!

194
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,309
Nada. Simon?

195
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,936
It's a food ghost town in here.

196
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,687
Alvin?

197
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,732
Holla!
The cheese balls are in the hizzouse.

Bingo!

209
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,597
Dinner, cheese a-served.

210
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,057
-Yay!
-All right!

211
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,308
Hey! What are you doing in here?

212
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,477
Uh... cheese ball?

213
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,271
MAN (over phone headset):
<i>Dude, let's go. Come on.</i>

214
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,523
Uh, Tombo, hey, hey.
Give me a second, real quick.

215
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,901
Alvin, I really,
really need to focus right now because

216
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,904
I am one knockout away
from a heavyweight title.

217
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,197
Ooh, can we play as well?

218
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,076
Uh, you know, I don't...
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

219
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,703
but I also don't want
to see anybody get hurt,

220
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,997
and there are going
to be fists of fury a-flying.

221
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,582
We can play Monopoly.

222
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,167
We play Monopoly with Dave all the time.

223
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,502
Do ya? That sounds...
that sounds fun.

224
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,713
And we should do that sometime,
but right now I gotta get back

225
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,756
to floating like a butterfly
and stinging like a bee, so...

226
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,216
TOBY: Hey, Tombo,
you still there, buddy?

227
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,884
Oh.

228
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,387
Ah, who needs Toby, Theodore?

229
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,264
-You got us!
-Yeah!

230
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,849
Who needs Toby?

231
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,434
Boys, right this way.

232
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,939
(all laughing)

233
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,276
<i>♪ You spin me right round, baby ♪</i>

234
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,194

237
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,328
(all laughing)

238
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,871
I'm gonna puke!

239
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,664
(laughing)
Wait, wait.

240
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,042
Do you know what Dave would say
if he were here right now?

241
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,127
BOTH (screaming):
Alvin!

242
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,380
Not bad, but I think it needs
to come more from the belly.

243
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,798
ALL:
Alvin!

244
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,052
(all laughing)

245
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,345
-(rings)
-BOTH: Oh!

246
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,763
Hold it. Get it together.
(clears throat)

247
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,973
-Yee-haw!
-Shh, shh. Be cool.

248
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,142
-Yes?
-Hello?

249
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,101
DAVE: <i>Boys, it's me.</i>

250
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,353
-Huh? Dave?
-Dave?

251
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,271
As in... Dave?

252
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,898
Well, I guess since you
answered the phone,

253
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,566
you haven't burned down
the house yet.

254
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,151
ALVIN:
<i>Have a little faith, Dave.</i>

255
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,986
Yeah! Mayday!

256
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,864
(clattering)

257
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,324
What was that?

258
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,617
(whispering)
Don't stress him out.

259
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,452
Uh, that was Aunt Jackie.

260
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,623
Yeah. She's making us
a zesty five-course meal. (chuckles)

261
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,959
Really? Well, can I talk to her?

262
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,253
She's practicing her pole dancing.

263
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,381
DAVE: <i>Pole dancing?</i>
<i>What happened to making dinner?</i>

264
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,092
-Guys? What's going on?
-Gotta go, Dave.

265
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,177
-Alvin, I'm not kidding.
-Feel better.

266
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,138
-DAVE (yelling): <i>Alvin!</i>
-(phone disconnects)

267
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,182
Yep, nobody does that better than him.

268
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,560
(snoring)

269
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,856
(whimpering)

270
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,072
(shrieks)

271
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,116
(gasping)

272
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,284
(whimpering)

273
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,878
(whimpering)

274
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,549
-Toby? Toby, wake up.
-(gasps)

275
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,510
What?

276
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,554
Oh, sorry.

277
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,224
Huh? No. That's... That's, uh... That's...
It's okay. What is it?

278
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,767
I... I had a nightmare.

279
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,272
Oh, the nightmares.
I hate the nightmares. What was it?

280
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:15,943
I... I dreamt
we didn't have a family anymore.

281
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,113
Oh, Theodore... Theodore,
that couldn't happen.

282
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:23,367
No. You guys are tight.
Nothing could ever separate you.

283
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,579
Unless, like an eagle swooped down
from the sky and was, like, "Caw! Caw!"

284
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,456
-What?
-And grabbed you and... (blubbering)

285
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,498
(laughs)

286
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,418
(whimpers)

287
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,462
Which... Which... Which...
couldn't happen ever.

288
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,964
So why would you... why would you ever
think that that would ever happen?

289
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,632
You know,
'cause the Eagles are in Philadelphia.

290
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,093
THEODORE:
No! No!

291
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,928
Sweet dreams.

292
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,268
(alarm clock buzzing)

293
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,271
ALVIN: Toby! Toby, make it stop!

294
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,522
What are you doing?

295
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,400
There's something wrong
with the clock. It won't shut up!

296
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,861
I can't sleep.
(screams)

297
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,280
That's the, uh...
That's the point.

298
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,240
It's a... It's a...
It's an alarm clock.

299
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,160
It's... It helps you
wake up early in the morning.

300
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,329
Why would anyone want
to wake up early?

301
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,998
Well, for school.
You got to be there by 8:00.

302
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,541
In the morning?

303
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,710
Look, I don't like getting up
this early any more than you do.

304
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,338
But we are in this together, Alvin.

305
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,631
Sooner you get to school,

306
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,633
sooner I get to come home
and get back to sleep.

307
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,885
You mean,

308
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,428
you don't stay with us at school?

309
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,471
No, no, no, no, no.

310
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,264
I've done my time.
Thank you very much.

311
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,558
-But school is fun, right?
-(laughing) Fun?

312
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,144
Well, I guess maybe it's, uh, fun-ish.

313
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,480
Hey, it's my cat.

314
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,482
Hey, remember?
I was telling you. Hey, hey.

315
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,317
Hey, kitty, it's me, remember?

A chaotic and frightening walk
in the park.

349
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,471
(screaming)

350
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,223
Ow! Ow! Ow!

351
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,684
Oh! Ow! Ouch! Aah!

352
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,352
(crashing)

353
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,313
That wasn't very fun-ish.

354
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,064
-(clears throat)
-Oh.

355
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,900
You must be our new students.

356
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,027
I'm Dr. Rubin, the principal.

357
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,905
And we are The Chipmunks.

358
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,158
Yes. Well, that would explain
the fur and the bushy tails.

359
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,035
Follow me, gentlemen.

360
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,412
Gentlemen?
Oh, us. Right.

361
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,916
There was a minute left
and we were down by two,

362
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,253
and I'm, like, "Coach, I don't care if my
leg's broken. Put me in. I can win this."

363
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,963
I never get tired of this story.

364
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,674
So I hobble out, barely able to stand.

365
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,134
Did I mention my leg was broken?

366
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,470
-(knocking)
-Miss Ortega?

367
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,388
Yes?
Good luck.

368
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,057
Thanks.

369
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,184
Well, guys, welcome to homeroom.

370
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,311
Good to be here...
I hope.

371
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,356
So this is a classroom.
(sniffing)

372
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,067
I love the smell
of zit cream in the morning.

373
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,695
Hello, ladies.

374
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,656
(girls chattering and squealing)
The Chipmunks!

375
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,115
GIRL:
Love you, Alvin!

376
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,742
GIRL TWO: Hi.

377
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,244
Hi. I'm Theodore.

378
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,454
Hi, I'm Theodore.

379
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,538
(muffled)
Hi. I'm Theodore.

380
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,124
Yes, he's Theodore,
in case you missed it, and I am Simon.

381
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,793
GIRLS: Aw!

382
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,921
The name's Seville.
Alvin Seville.

383
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,255
Oh.

384
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,716
(speaking French)
Enchante, mademoiselle.

385
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,176
(sighs)

386
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,806
Somebody's gonna have to knock
those guys down to size.

387
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,392
Well, that should be pretty easy.
I mean, they're only eight inches tall.

396
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,132
I mean, that's like five more cars
than anybody really needs.

397
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,510
I had seven maids.

398
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,804
I had courtside seats to the Lakers.

399
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,143
Even my maids
had courtside seats to the Lakers.

00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,526

(laughs)

410
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,039
Now I run around, hoping and praying

411
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,332
that I can find other animals
that can sing or dance.

412
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,084
-I mean...
-(squeaking)

413
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,712

You don't sing, do you?

414
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,298
Hey! Hey,
that's my muffin! My...

417
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,432
I will get you, chipmunks.

(yelping)

419
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,735
Girls, we got to get out of here.

420
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,403
I can't see.

421
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,822
Ow! Not on my nose.

422
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,407
-That's my tail.
-Sorry.

423
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,159
-Move your butt.
-Okay.

424
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,243
Who's pushing me?

425
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,829
(grunting and groaning)

426
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,123

428
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,876
We made it.

429
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,044
JETT Records.

430
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,087
Whoo...

431
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,550
Oh, my gosh.
It's him. Ian Hawke.

432
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,676
Um, Mr. Hawke?

433
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,889
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

434
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,893
Hello! Mr. Hawke!

435
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,814
That's not in my head.
That's really happening.

436
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,650
-What do you want?
-We want to introduce ourselves.

437
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,777
That's right.
I'm Brittany.

438
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,779
And this is my sister, Eleanor.

439
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,988
Hello, sir.

440
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,032
Such a pleasure to meet you.

441
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,867
And I'm their sister, Jeanette.

442
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,079
Although, I feel more like an Olivia.
Or sometimes...

443
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,248
Anyway, we are The Chipettes.

444
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,542
And, well, we would just be so honored

445
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,377
to have you represent us.

446
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,420
You made Alvin and the Chipmunks stars.

447
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,339
-We want to be stars too.
-Yeah.

448
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,341
And hang out with the Chipmunks.
(laughs)

449
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,928
Okay. Now, listen, before we get all girly
and giggly about this,

450
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,346
uh, just tell me one thing.

451
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,557
You can sing, right?

452
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,060
(whispering)

453
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,188
Anyway, hang on.
Not here. Um...

454
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,775
Why don't we, uh, take this meeting
upstairs in my penthouse office?

455
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,152
Sure.

456
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh, this is so exciting.
We're really on our way now.

457
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,450
Oh, my gosh.
Wow.

458
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,410
Can you believe it?

459
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,288
Oh, my first penthouse office!

460
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,789
Oh, wow.

461
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,124
Oh, boy.

462
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,251
Oh, my...

463
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,502
The Hollywood sign.

464
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,461
-Oh.
-Wow.

465
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,505
Thought you might like the view.

466
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,133
So, ladies, tell me a little something
about yourselves.

467
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,887
Well, we grew up in a small town,
population 300 and--

468
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,930
Yeah? Really?
That's fascinating.

469
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,391
Great. All right.
Impress me.

470
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,144
(chipmunks whispering)

471
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,396
One, two, three.

472
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,439

Oh, my goodness.

489
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,819
So when can we meet the Chipmunks?

490
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,781
Uh, that's an excellent question,

491
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,449
and the excellent answer is

492
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,161
I don't really represent
Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

493
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,288
-Oh, no!
-What happened?

494
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,415
Oh. Classic tale.

495
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,043
Sweet and innocent when I met them.
They had nothing, and then,

496
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,422
I worked my butt off to make them
rock stars and... they changed.

497
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,510
Turned on me like bad cheese.

498
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,552
No!

499
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,221
Oh. That's terrible.

500
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,847
I know.

501
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,850
I mean, I treated Alvin
like he was my own son,

502
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,979
you know, and then
he just goes and spits on me.

503
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,441
Literally. He filled his chipmunk cheeks
with saliva and just had at it.

504
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,318
Don't even get me started about Simon.

505
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,530
(gasps)
But not Theodore, right?

506
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,531
It's the cuddly ones

507
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,408
-you have to watch out for.
-(sighs)

508
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,326
HAWKE: But what are we talking
about them for? Come on.

509
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,662
HAWKE:
They're over. Tired, novelty act.

510
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,498
Chipmunks who can sing.
(yawns)

511
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,749
But...

512
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,044
Girl chipmunks
who can sing?

513
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,006

515
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,052
ALVIN: So, I'm on Jay Z's yacht, right?

516
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,555
And I say, "Jay, where's Beyonce?

517
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,433
And he says, "She's holding
a plate full of cheese balls."

518
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,102
Turn around, and guess what? She was.

519
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,312
(girls laughing)

520
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,564
P.S.
Dave left me in charge.

521
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,566
Staying up till 10:00 every night.

522
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,692
-Oh, yeah.
-(laughing)

523
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,028
Hey, girls.
Look what I can do.

524
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,280
(girls laugh)

525
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,365
-You are Theodorable.
-THEODORE: Thank you.

526
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,491
You're so cute.

527
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,826
Whoops.

528
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,204
Oh! I am so sorry.

529
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,415
It's cool.
No harm done.

530
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,833
Not yet.

531
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,419
Girls, please.
Private conference.

532
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,962
-(scoffs)
-RYAN: Thank you.

533
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,761
Listen up, rock stars.

534
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,098
If you talk to those girls again,
you're dead.

535
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,809
If you look at those girls again,
you're dead.

536
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,228
If you even think about those girls...

537
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,898
Are you thinking about them?

538
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,025
Well, I am now!

539
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,235
That's it.

540
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,112
-You're dead!
-CHIPMUNKS: Run!

541
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,155
Daniel, come on!

542
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,406
Get back here, you dirty rats!

543
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,825
-Hang ten, bros!
-Whoa!

544
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,287
Scatter!

545
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,831
Go, go, go!

546
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,083
That way, over there!

547
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,918
Oh, Ryan!

548
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,755
Hey, slowpokes.
Catch me if you can!

549
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,510
You're dead, furball!

550
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,677
Not!

551
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,138
-It's wedgie time!
-Oh!

552
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,723
My butt!

553
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,934
-(groaning)
-(Alvin laughing)

554
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,687
(panting)

555
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,817
Oh, boy...

556
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,111
Uh, eagle.

557
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,737
(screaming)

558
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,447
-Eagle! Eagle!
-RYAN: Get him!

559
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,491
(screaming)
Bully, bully!

560
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,034
This way! This way!

561
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,869
RYAN: Gotcha!

562
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,996
-SIMON: Guys, wait, wait. Time-out.
-RYAN: It's swirly time!

563
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,873
Oh, come on. Come on, guys.
This is so 1980s.

564
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,875
(screaming)
Police! Police!

565
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:39,876
(gargling)

566
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,796
Oh, man!
Oh, come on!

567
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,215
That, that's
a good look for you. Oh. Thank you.

568
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,636
I can't swim. Help!

569
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,638
-Grab on, Simon.
-(Simon grunting)

570
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,350
Oh, thanks.

571
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,936
(blubbering)

572
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,271
You okay?

573
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,440
Well, uh, considering
that you just saved me

574
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,443
from drowning in a toilet,
I'm, uh, pretty good.

575
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,279
I'll be right back.

576
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,781
A-Alvin, Alvin! We're not gonna
solve anything with violence.

577
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,950
-RYAN: It's the fatty ratty.
-THEODORE: Cut it out.

578
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,953
-This rat has serious junk in the trunk.
-BOY: Yeah, little fatty.

579
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,121
THEODORE: Hey, stop it.

580
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,331
-RYAN: He jiggles when I poke him.
-(growling)

581
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,710
-(boys screaming)
-RYAN: Mommy!

582
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,548
Simon, does this make
my butt look smaller?

583
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,592
Theodore, your butt looks fine.

584
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,968
Those guys are just jerks.

585
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,886
(door opening)

586
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,472
(growling)

587
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,183
(growling)

588
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,559
-(barking)
-(boys whimpering)

589
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,978
Gentlemen.

590
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,815
You threatened to climb inside
of him and build a nest.

591
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,944
That was out of line. Um, I'm not
even sure that's physically possible.

592
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,073
I should suspend all three of you.

593
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,575
Please do.

594
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,294
Instead, I have a better idea.

595
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,339
Due to budget cutbacks,

596
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,842
we are in jeopardy of losing our beloved
music program.

597
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,385
-That's awful.
-DR. RUBIN: I know.

598
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,305
But there is one small ray of hope.

599
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,225
Every year, the district sponsors
a music competition

600
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,145
and the winner's school receives $25,000.

601
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,648
If we win, we can save our program.

602
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,399
And you want us to perform?

603
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,528
'Cause I didn't think you were a fan.

604
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,822
Why don't you sleep on it?

605
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,076
-Wait a minute! What is that?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait.

606
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,620
-THEODORE: I look skinny.
-That's us.

607
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,664
Promise me that you won't say anything.

608
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,165
A principal has a certain image to uphold

609
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,584
and if the faculty
ever found out about this, I could...

610
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:50,048
Oh... I just cannot believe
that you're actually sitting in my office!

611
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,800
I have all of your CDs.

612
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,677
I even went to see you
last year in Denver.

613
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,136
That's where I got this.

614
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,430
It was my birthday.

615
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,599
And I was like, "Oh, The Chipmunks!"

616
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:06,731
So, what do you say?
Will you represent our school?

617
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,235
Honestly, suspension
still sounds pretty good to me.

618
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,445
Come on, Alvin, what do you say?

619
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,906
One for all and three for one!

620
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,992
Well put, Theodore, very well put.

621
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,326
Count us in.

622
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,828
ALVIN (unenthusiastically):
Yay.

623
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,038
Go, Eagles!
(hisses)

624
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,373
Eagles? Where?

625
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,546
HAWKE:
Ah, the penthouse level.

626
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,214
(speaking French)
Tres exclusivo.

627
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,051
(dog whimpering)

628
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,928
BRITTANY:
Isn't that that Chihuahua?

629
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,179
You know, from the movie?

630
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,682
Oh, yeah.

631
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,309
Yeah, it is.
I mean, yeah, of course it is.

632
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,893
A lot of, a lot of big names live here.

633
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,437
(speaking Spanish)
Hola. Como estas?

634
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,813
I must have his autograph.

635
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,398
Hey, hey, Brittany, uh-uh.

636
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,817
You wanna be a star?
Act like a star.

637
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,819
All right, you don't get autographs.
You give them.

638
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,904
Oh. Right.

639
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,451
Uh, uh... Hey, look, over there.
There's a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

640
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,869
(gasps)
Where?

641
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,871
-I don't see them.
-HAWKE: Here we are.

642
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,626
Okay. Let's, uh, scoot into my apart...

643
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,420
What? Did I?
I, oh, darn it!

644
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,463
Darn it to heck!

645
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,673
-What's wrong?
-Girls, I apologize,

646
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,218
but I seem to
have left my keys back in my office.

647
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,219
Ah...

648
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,388
What if one of you
were to shoot through that mail slot

649
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,265
and open it up from the inside? Huh?

650
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,558
Oh, I'll do it.

651
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,853
(grunting)

652
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,063
I'm stuck!

653
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,233
All right, I got you. I got you.

654
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,027
(grunting)

655
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:37,364
Oh, oh, ow!

656
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,115
Not so hard!

657
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,785
-HAWKE: Might wanna lay off the nuts.
-Oh.

658
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,746
All right, how about you, glasses?
You're in better shape. Wanna go?

659
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,248
Uh, I'm not that great
at things like this.

660
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,166
I got it!

661
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,544
(lock clicking)

662
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,504
Yes.

663
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,052
Ooh, impressive!

664
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,136
(gasps)
Nice.

665
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,346
Gee willikers.

666
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,932
-Stripes.
-Oh, snazzy.

667
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:04,849
(gasps)
Circles!

668
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,518
This is the best tree house ever!

669
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,645
A red piano.

670
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,980
-Oh, red.
-Is this a dream?

671
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,315
Somebody pinch me.

672
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,233
-Ah...
-Oh...

673
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,818
This is way better than a tree.

674
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,654
Oh, I just adore a penthouse view.

675
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,280
Nice one, Hawke.

676
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,284
-Yeah, you like it?
-Do I?

677
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,121
-I live here.
-It's so beautiful.

678
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,372
HAWKE: Yeah.

679
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,502
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Last time we visited Meerkat Manor,</i>

680
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>a rival group called the Commandos</i>

681
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,174
<i>was making large inroads</i>
<i>into the Whiskers' territory.</i>

682
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,388
<i>(Meerkat Manor</i>
<i>theme song playing)</i>

683
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,640
(sniffing)
Ah, Toby.

684
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,977
I thought Alvin was messy.
This is literally disgusting.

685
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,730
I feel like I'm living
in a dumpster. Ooh...

686
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,608
Simon, it's <i>Meerkat Manor.</i>
Watch with me.

687
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,278
(sighs) Well, yeah, you know you're right.
You're right. I just need to relax.

688
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,196
Maybe that'll, uh,
ease my nerves a little.

689
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,198
-(crunch)
-Wait. What is this?

690
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:07,704
What? Oh, you gotta
be joking. A taco? In a blanket?

691
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,123
Toby.

692
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:15,211
TOBY: Ladies and gentlemen,
going for his turkey, it's the Tobester.

693
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,672
(grunts)

694
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,716
Come on, baby.

695
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,051
(Toby laughing)

696
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,803
Yes.

697
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,221
Yes!

698
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,224
-Eh?
-No problem.

699
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,018
Watch and learn, my friends.

700
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,437
(crackling)

701
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,689
Whoops.

702
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,357
Well, it looks like it's time to play

703
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,736
my second favorite game,
"Hide the broken TV from Dave."

704
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,695
You wanna play?

705
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,363
No!

706
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,032
Go easy on him, taco boy.

707
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,909
This day's been bad enough already.

708
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,457
Oh, I think I see what's going on.

709
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,709
TOBY: You guys been having
some problems at school?

710
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,211
Uh, no, not really.

711
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,587
Unless you consider having your head

712
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,380
dumped into a public toilet a problem.

713
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,842
(laughing) Ouch.
Swirlies are the worst.

714
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,597
At least, that's what I've heard.

715
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,391
Because there's no way that I could
possibly know that on a...

716
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,684
on a personal level.

717
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,188
Toby, what was school like for you?

718
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,566
THEODORE: Toby...

719
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,151
-(school bell ringing)
-Toby?

720
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,611
(toilet flushing)

721
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,949
(gurgling and chuckling)

722
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,700
Ow, ow.

723
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,331
Ow, ow!

724
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,499
(shrieking)

725
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,962
(school bell ringing)

726
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,434
THEODORE: Toby?

727
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,477
THEODORE (yelling):
Toby!

728
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,937
What?

729
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,482
What was school like for me?
Uh, in a word...

730
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,025
awesome.

731
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:06,072
But, you know, that's 'cause
I was like extremely popular.

732
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,158
Is that why you still
live with your grandma?

733
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,286
And refer to yourself
as "The Tobester"?

734
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,912
And go "Pew, pew, pew" all day?

735
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,583
(chuckles smugly)
Bedtime.

736
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,963
(alarm buzzing)

737
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,549
Alvin?

738
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,095
Alvin, wake up and turn off the alarm.

739
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,849
(alarm continues buzzing)

740
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,560
Alvin!

741
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,813
Alvin, I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding, buddy. Turn it off!

742
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,023
Guys, guys...

743
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:44,193
(alarm buzzing)

744
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,949
Boys, this isn't funny.

745
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:54,245
ALVIN (muffled): Hello, Humane Society?
Yes, I need help. A man is after us.

746
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,039
He wants to take us to a terrible place!

747
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,207
-School!
-TOBY: Out.

748
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,752
-Oh, have a heart, huh?
-Have a heart?

749
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,296
Dave wants you to go to school,
so you're going.

750
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,049
Yeah, well, don't worry about
picking us up at 3:00, Toby.

751
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,092
We'll get a ride in a hearse!

752
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,679
Guys, guys, come on.
Look, trust me.

753
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,473
The second day is never
as bad as the first.

754
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,937
(grunting)

755
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,146
SIMON: Glasses, glasses!

756
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,814
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses,
would you?

757
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,901
Right in the pancreas.

758
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,612
(grunting)

759
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,448
(panting, groaning)

760
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,451
Call... the... nurse.

761
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,452
Out, out, you're out!

762
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,580
Come on, Alvin!
Remember your five Ds!

763
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,959
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!

764
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,543
-BOY: Move!
-You're next, furball.

765
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,420
You talking to me?

766
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,006
You talking to me?

767
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,009
I'm the only one here,
so you must be talking to me.

768
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,720
(crowd laughs)

769
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,015
-Yeah!
-Whoa!

770
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,476
-Got him!
-RYAN: Did you see that?

771
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,353
Ooh, booyah!

772
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,564
Unbelievable.
He caught it. You're out, man.

773
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,609
-(school bell ringing)
-And the fat lady, she's a-singin'.

774
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,404
Dude's got hands.

775
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,781
-I think they're paws actually.
-Whatever.

776
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,366
We can definitely use him on the team.

777
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,535
Hey, furball.

778
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,578
RYAN: How'd you like a spot
on the football team?

779
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,288
Football? Moi?

780
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,748
I gotta say, you're good.

781
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm gonna let you
hang out with us at lunch.

782
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,878
RYAN: That is,
if you wanna be on the team.

783
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,006
Hmm...
Interesting proposition.

784
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,340
THEODORE: Alvin?

785
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,092
Let me get back to you on that.

786
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,845
This is a one-time offer.
Don't take too long to think it over.

787
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,513
(boys laugh)

788
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,099
Right.
Like I would ditch my brothers

789
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,851
just to become the first chipmunk ever

790
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,270
to play on an actual
varsity football team.

791
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,648
(forced chuckle)
Fat chance.

792
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:50,194
ALVIN: The stadium is pandemonium.
It's fourth and goal.

793
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,823
It's up, it's up...
And he catches it!

794
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,992
The crowd goes crazy.

795
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,493
(mimicking screaming crowd)

796
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,745
RYAN: Psst. Hey.

797
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,290
Me?

798
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,752
ALVIN (chanting):
Alvin! Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!

799
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,295
(mimicking screaming crowd)

800
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,548
Alvin, I think the super-cool jock table
is paging you.

801
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,217
Why would I go over there?

802
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,887
Like I really need to worry
about being popular.

803
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,514
Hello! Talking chipmunk.
Huh?

804
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,684
World-famous rock star.
Guy with his own plush doll.

805
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,853
Guys, I'm on pajamas!

806
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,438
Not toot my own horn, but...

807
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,482
(mimicking honking horn)

808
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,484
Come on.

809
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,402
(chuckling)
It's... It's... It's laughable.

810
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,863
Just go, Alvin.

811
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,115
-Really? You mean it?
-Yeah.

812
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,034
Oh, thanks.
I'll be right back.

813
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,371
-What up, dudes?
-What's up, lil' man?

814
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,165
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Welcome to the cool table.

815
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,708
-Bring it. Pound the paw.
-Yeah.

816
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,834
<i>(</i>"It's OK" <i>playing)</i>

817
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,670

818
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,548

819
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,716
(Alvin groans)

820
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,384
I want it!

821
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,429
I got it! I got it!

822
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,224
I... (grunts) don't got it.

823
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,101
-I think he's cute.
-Me too.

824
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,144
ALVIN: Toss.

825
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,854
And he's up.

826
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,524
(cheering and applauding)

827
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,900
Thank you.

828
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:11,859
Hey, Alvin.

829
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,654
Call me.

830
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,698
Bernie, I'm telling ya.
Chipmunks are old news.

831
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,911
I got the next big thing.
Singing female chipmunks.

832
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,290
Hello? Bernie? Hello?

833
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:31,170
Oh, God! What part of "singing female
chipmunks" don't these people understa...

834
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,426
Girls... we're going to school.

835
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,679
And he's up.

836
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,430
-BOYS: Oh!
-And he scores!

837
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,723
(boys cheering)

838
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,017
Hey, what up, S?

839
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,479
Whoa, don't hate on the high-five.

840
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,941
Yeah. High-five.

841
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,861
Look, Alvin, I know you guys
have been busy with your

842
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,737
sporting endeavors and what not,

843
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,906
but, uh, I could really
use your help at home.

844
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,408
Oh, no, can do.

845
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,287
Ry Dog is going to teach me
how to get pretty girls to do my homework.

846
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,708
Uh, well, Alvin,
you promised Theodore we'd hang out.

847
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,752
We are watching
<i>Meerkat Manor </i>tonight. No pretty girls.

848
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,963
Dude, I can't swing it today, bro.

849
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,965
That's what you say every day, Alvin.

850
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,467
Need I remind you
it's your day to do the laundry?

851
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,178
RYAN: Better listen to your daddy, Alvin.

852
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,971
You don't want to get grounded.

853
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,181
Oh!

854
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,726
Are you going to pick that up?

855
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,604
Are you going to make me?

856
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,439
(chuckles) (speaking French)
Au contraire, mon frere.

857
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,066
I'm just going to elegantly show you
how it's done.

858
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:35,985
Eh, Simon...

859
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:38,905
Off the glass.

860
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,325
And you call yourself a jock.

861
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,620
-(laughs)
-(laughs)

862
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,289
(laughs sarcastically)
Ha, my brother.

863
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,459
He's a real jokester.
Always kidding.

864
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,045
Uh, anyhoo, um, see you guys in class.

865
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,507
-Hey, that's my plate.
-It's my plate.

866
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,967
(laughs)

867
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,303
Why are you trying to embarrass me
in front of my friends?

868
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,679
Are you kidding me?

869
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,765
They are the ones you should be
embarrassed by.

870
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,683
-Good luck with the show, guys.
-Front row seats.

871
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,809
Can't wait.

872
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,686
So, what song are we gonna sing?

873
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,606
No pressure, but the whole school
is counting on us.

874
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,774
Oh, relax.

875
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,277
It's like Ryan says.
"Who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?"

876

I'd never thought I'd say this, but,
pink is my new favorite color.

899
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,718
Her glasses were quite fetching.

900
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,055
She's like a beautiful, green gumdrop.

901
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,183
Okay, well, if you guys want to do this,
you have to pay attention.

902
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,352
Maybe this is a good time
for us to take a break.

903
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,979
Good call.
Take five.

904
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,522
Oh, she...
Oh, she's right.

905
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,899
-Oh, we need to focus, fellas.
-Right.

906
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,526
This is for my screen saver.

Hey, guys. Hey.
You guys ready to go?

909
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,242
Guys, I got a lot of important stuff
to do at home.

910
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,828
Oh, you must be their guardian.

911
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,330
Guard... That I...
That I am.

912
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,541
Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?
How are you, Dr. Rubin?

913
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,585
I know that because I went to school here
a few years ago.

914
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,254
I don't know if you remember me.
Toby Seville. Probably not.

915
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,505
Mmm. I...

916
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,465
Toby?

917
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,843

MISS ORTEGA: No way!

918
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,763
Hi!
Hey, no braces.

919
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,556
-(breathing heavily)
-You look great.

920
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,976
You... I... Thank you. Appreciate it.
I did... I did...

921
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,812
I... I did get my braces off
because they were just...

922
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:17,730

923
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,647

Oh, that.

who... who works on drum heads.

929
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,831
So that's very good.
I'll be in the car, guys. (sighs)

ALVIN (sing-song):
Somebody's in love.

to replace everything. Chipmunks' honor.

932
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,051
HAWKE: Ah, yes, the old false modesty
suck-up routine.

933
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,094
-Ian Hawke?
-Ian?

934
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,553
Thought I smelled a rat.

935
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,263
May I help you, Mr. Hawke?

936
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,015
Well, I was wondering
if I could, uh, help you.

937
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,101
I... I just heard about
your musical competition

938
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,187
and I just skedaddled down here
as quick as I could to volunteer my girls.

939
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,189
Oh. Well, that's very thoughtful of you,

940
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,483
but I've already made up my mind.

941
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,195
Well, um, perhaps,
this will change your mind.

942
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,197
Girls!

943
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,865

00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,033

00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,986
you have just witnessed the debut

00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,489
-(cheering and applauding)
-Thank you.

978
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,159
So?

979
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:39,497
They were splendid, but as I said before,
I have made my decision.

980
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,332
-Brit!
-No.

981
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,794
I see.
You... you've made your decision.

982
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,965
I don't mean to speak out
of school, Doctor, but,

983
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,843
um, in the true spirit of democracy,

984
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:57,097
which our great,
wonderful country was founded upon,

985
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,559
I say, "Let the people vote."

986
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:05,814
Let them choose. One person, one vote!
I say, "Let us vote."

987
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,942
Let us vote!

Let us vote!

990
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,369
Please, don't be a Fascist Franny.
Let freedom ring, Doctor.

991
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,579
ALL (chanting):
Let us vote! Let us vote!

992
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,501
You make a persuasive case, Mr. Hawke.

993
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,464
All right, here's what I'm going to do.

994
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,843
This Friday, each group will perform
one song in front of the student body.

995
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,303
-Yeah!
-Right!

996
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,764
Whoever gets the most applause
will represent the school.

997
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,057
-(cheering and applauding)
-What?

998
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,934

-Yes.

999
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,143
We did it.

1000
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,104
In your face!

1001
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,274
Oh, it is on like <i>Donkey Kong.</i>

1002
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,069
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
<i>The meerkats huddle together</i>

1003
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:56,407
<i>at the end of a traumatic day</i>
<i>to reaffirm their family bond.</i>

<i>on each other more than ever.</i>

1005
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,705
Guys, I am so happy that Miss Ortega

1006
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,665
can rehearse with us
every day after school.

1007
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,208
Whoa! Every day?

1008
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,920
-But, Ryan and I...
-Alvin, stop right there, okay?

1009
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,673
We're a team.
We need you.

1010
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,467
Would you relax?
We're not gonna lose.

1011
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,261
We'll talk about this in the morning.

1012
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:21,473
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at rehearsal.

1013
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,935
Stop hogging!

1014
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,562
I'm not hogging.

1015
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,024
You might as well be rooting out truffles
in the French countryside

1016
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,942
because are you in fact hogging!

1017
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,193
-I'm not! Not!
-Are so!

1018
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,778
-So! So! So!
-I'm not! Not! Not!

1019
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,780
-(overlapping chatter)
-Ah, forget it!

1020
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,616
I think I'll sleep in my own bed tonight.

1021
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,783
Ditto for me.

1022
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,078
-ALVIN: I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat!
-SIMON: Oh, really? Why's that?

1023
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,914
ALVIN: Because as cold as I am,
I would never huddle with you!

1024
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,124
-SIMON: Good.
-ALVIN (muffled): You hear me?

1025
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,667
I won't huddle!

1026
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,002
SIMON (muffled): Fine.

1027

1029
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,973

Can I sleep with you?

1030
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,019
What?

1031
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,104
Dave lets me.

1032
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,065
My brothers are fighting.

1033
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,069
Well, I'm...

1034
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,071
You... okay.

1035
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,948

THEODORE:
Oh, man! Dutch oven! Not the Dutch oven!

1039
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,379
Oh, anything but the Dutch oven!

1040
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,340
Must find fresh air before it's too late!

1041
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,925

It's too late!

1042
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,969
Oh, it burns!
Mama, it burns!

(sighs)

1046
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,204
Hmm, let's see...
What else am I in the mood for?

1047
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,289
How about a side order of friendly advice?

1048
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,708
Courtesy of me.

1049
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,084
No, thanks.

1050
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,586
Grapes, please.

1051
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,630
-Oh. Ow!
-(chuckles, clears throat)

1052
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,091
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, well...

1053
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:23,095
I... I just wanted
to warn you about Ian.

1054
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,265
What? You should be grateful to Ian.

1055
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,476
He did everything
for you, Alvin, and you broke his heart.

1056
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,978
Hmm, really?

1057
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,896
How do I put this gently?

1058
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,566
He's the devil.
He doesn't have a heart.

1059
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:39,361
Oh, and one of the things he did for us
was put us in a cage.

1060
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,238
Alvin, he would never do that.

1061
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,949
Yeah, 'cause you were there.
I forgot.

1062
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,451
Brittany, you better watch out.

1063
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,119
-I don't need advice from you.
-But--

1064
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,122
But nothing, Alvin. Ian's taking us
straight to the... (screaming)

1065
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,623

1066

(laughing)

1067
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,671
Got it.
Straight to the top. Ironic.

1068
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,841
Yeah, funny.

1071
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,515
We are so going
to destroy those Chipmunks.

1072
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,517
I don't want
to destroy them. Me neither.

1073
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,269
I just wanna hang out with them.

All right, all right,
hold on, all right, look.

Uh, you know, if you feel that way,

1076
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,067
maybe we should just
withdraw from the contest.

1077
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,111
-What?
-And then I'll put you in a FedEx package

1078
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,906

you came from. Sound good?

-No.

1080
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,034

Well, you gotta work on that, okay?

Let's get a little more separation.

more separation from you guys.

Where's Aunt Jackie?

I am.

00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,207
So, Dave, uh, how is Paris?

1115
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,709
Wait. Are the boys behaving?

1116
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,461
Absolutely.
They've been just peachy.

No, don't even...
Don't even worry about it.

not supposed to be stressed out,

I don't mean to interrupt your game,

1128
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:30,115
but, I saw you stand up
to Ryan when he littered.

1129
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,992
-That took guts.
-Really?

1130
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,869
And that's the type of guy
that we're looking for.

1131
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,871
Jeremy Smith,
Student Body President.

How do you do?
I'm--

1133
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,959
International recording star
and litter monitor, Simon Seville?

1134
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,586
Litter monitor?

1135
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,588
Litter monitor.
It's a new position that we've created

1136
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,216
to help raise awareness
of a pressing problem in our society.

1137
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,804
I agree 99% plus one.
You do the math.

1138
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,600
Well, Simon, I know this is a lot to ask,

1139
00:48:56,683 --> 00:49:00,729
but, we're looking for
a take-charge guy to

1140
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,732
take charge of this
very rewarding position.

1141
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,983
What do you say?

Uh, I'm Simon.
I'm the litter monitor.

00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,579
Hello, ladies.

1148
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,957
You probably weren't aware
that you dropped a wrapper on the ground,

1149
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,084
so we're just going
to call this one a warning.

1150
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,629
Carry on.

-What up, dudes?
-What up, Al?

1153
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,593
Hey, everybody, check it out.

1154
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,262

00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,767
Ry, don't mess with me.

1157
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,686
I talked to Coach.
You're in.

00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,188
Dude, that's great.
Awesome!

1159
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,733
So check it out, A-Man.
We're watching the new litter monitor.

1160
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,778
I wasn't aware
the school even had a litter monitor.

1161
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,655
We don't.
But don't tell him that.

1162
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,451

Are you going to pick that up?

1163
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,078
No.

1164
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,038
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1165
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,250

to have to give you a citation.

00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,130
-Oh! Oh, no, I...
-Oh ho...

1167
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,132
-I got a citation for littering.
-BOY: Oh, no.

1168
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,551

1169
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,803
Oh, you want to play that game,
do you? (scoffs) Well, guess what?

1170
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,222
-I can play that game all day long.
-Simon...

1171
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,100
-It's a joke, dude.
-Litter is no joking matter.

1172
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,935
-(laughter)
-BOY: No, you're the joke.

1173
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,105
We're messing with you.
There's no such thing as a litter monitor.

1174
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,983
-What?
-Good one, huh?

1175
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,484
(chuckles)

1176
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,778
You knew about this, Alvin?

1177
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,780
Does the word "brother"
mean anything to you?

1178
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,782
Y-Yes, o-of course.

1179
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,159
Yeah, well, he has some new brothers

1180
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,827
now that he's on the football team.

1181
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,374
You still haven't picked up that litter.

1182
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,917
-You want me to get rid of litter?
-Yeah.

1183
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,127
Let's start with you.

1184
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,670
Hey... let go.
Let go.

1185
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,464
No... Whoa!

Alvin, I am going to put this behind us
for Theodore's sake.

1200
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,967
I know. That's why I'm giving you
the Alvin guarantee

1201
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:38,637
that I will be at that sing-off
Friday night.

1202
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,056
W-W-Wait.

Don't worry, Simon.

1372
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,392
Alvin will walk through
that door any minute now.

1373
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,602

-Alvin!

1374

1375

1379
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,870
Girls, that's for us.

1380
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,121
Thank you so much.

1381
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,998
Thank you.
Thank you.

1382
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,251
DR. RUBIN:
Well done, ladies.

1383
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:09,504
And now...
let's hear it for a group

1384
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,465
that will rock you like a hurricane.

1385
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:16,219
At least, that's what many
of you students have told me.

1386
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,304
Here they are.
The Chipmunks.

1387
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,598
(cheering and applauding)

1388
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,518
Hey, you know, they say there's no "I"
in the word "team,"and...

1389
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,686
and they're right.

1390
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,729
But you know what there is an "I" in?

1391
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,606
"Alvin."
(laughs)

1392
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,026
Sucks to be you.
Girls!

1393
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,862
Sadly, he's correct.

1394
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,114
(door opens)

1395
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,615
Did you find him?

1396
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,785
Guys. Sorry, I...
I... I searched the whole perimeter.

1397
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,413
And I don't know why,
but the team's not back yet.

1398
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,164
Well, what should we do?

1399
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,710
I would, um...

1400
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,086
CROWD (chanting):
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

1401
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,214
I would ask someone who's not me.

1402
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,717
(sighs)

1403
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,427
I know what we should do.

1404
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,138
CROWD: Chipmunks!
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!

1405

(cheering and applauding)

1407
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:10,857
Hi, everyone.

1408
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:14,235
(clears throat)
Uh...

1409
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,864
Our brother, Alvin couldn't...
couldn't be here today.

1410
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:22,827
Um, the thing is, we've...
we've never performed without Alvin,

1411
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,748
and... we're not starting now.

1412
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,207
(audience clamoring)

1413
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,627
You can't have only two little pigs.

1414
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,171
You can't have only two musketeers, so...

1415
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:36,132
So, you know you can't
have only two chipmunks.

1416
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:38,801
Thank you.

1417
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,681
(murmuring)

1418
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,642
-(crowd booing)
-BOY: Why don't you go back to the tree?

1419
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,689
I'll take you home.

01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,029

1421

HAWKE: Hear that, girls?

1422
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:09,749
That... is the sound of success.

1423
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,502
(crowd groaning, booing,
and clamoring)

1424
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:17,715
DR. RUBIN: I realize how devastated
you... Chipmunk fans must be.

1425
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,930
So I guess that means
that the Chipettes...

1426
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,432
Come on, girls.
Let's take a victory lap.

1427
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,309
(cheering and applauding)

1428
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,435
Hey, come on, guys.

1429
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,353
HAWKE: Let's go.

1430
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,979
Brit, we have to.

1431
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,481
Let's go.

1432
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,440
DR. RUBIN:
...Chipettes.

1433
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,403
(cheering and applauding)

1434
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,738
Thank you. Thanks.

1435
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,246
(door opening)

1436
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,833
Ah. Life is good.

1437
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,960
Especially when
you're not a loser.

1438
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,920
(door opening)

1439
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,547
Hey, guys, I'm here.

1440
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:00,883
Guys?

1441
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,428
Oh, great.

1442
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,721
They're gone, Alvin.

1443
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,473
They're never gonna forgive me.

1444
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,477
You know, Alvin, Ian was right.

1445
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,646
You don't care
about anyone but yourself.

1446
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:22,739
Oh, and by the way,
I never wanted to win this way.

1447
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,329
(sighs)

1448
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,333
(crickets chirping)

1449
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,254
Simon?
Theodore?

1450
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,884
Simon, are you awake?

1451
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:52,810
Theo?

1452
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,354
ALVIN (whispers):
Theo?

1453
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:58,733
(sighs)

1454
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,581
Theodore?
Theodore?

1455
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:16,209
Theodore,
I don't blame you for being mad.

1456
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,210
Uh-oh.

1457
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,631
"I ran away from home.

1458
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,425
"Don't look for me at the zoo
'cause I'm not there."

1459
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,177
Oh, no. Theodore.

1460
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,014
(elephant trumpeting)

1461
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,060
Hello?

1462
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,020
Meerkat family?

1463
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:38,815
(grunts)

1464
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,233
Oh, brother.

1465
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,527
(grunts)

1466
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,614
Is anyone home?

1467
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:50,034
My name is Theodore.
I'd like to be in your family.

1468
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,377
Maybe they're hiding.

1469
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,378
Don't be afraid.

1470
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,005

1471
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,215

1473
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:11,305
(whimpering)
You... are not a meerkat.

1474
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,100
Toby, you take the lions,
the tigers, and the bears.

1475
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,060
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

1476
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:19,146
Nice eagle.

1477
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,606
(eagle screeches)
SIMON: Theo!

1478
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,483
Don't move, Theodore.

1479
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,652
No problem there.

1480
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,530
Hang in there. Hang in there, little guy!
We're gonna get you out of there!

1481
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,450
Okay, okay, we need a plan.

1482
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,161
We need a carefully executed plan.

1483
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,914
Or you could just, uh,
run in there like a maniac.

1484
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,041
(screeching)

1485
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,293
Theo, watch out!

1486
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,253
Hi. I'm Theodore.

1487

1488
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,257
Hey, birdie, over here.

1489
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,219
Are you hungry?
'Cause this "A" stands for "appetizer."

1490
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,889
(squawking)
Oh, oh, um...

1491
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,892
Let's all just relax,
and we'll talk this out, okay?

1492
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,852
Look, um...

1493
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,022
I get why you want Theodore.

1494
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,440
I do.

1495
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:06,485
But, I'm sorry.
I can't let that happen.

1496
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,530
He's my brother,
not that he'd know that...

1497
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:12,617
Because I've been such a big jerk lately.

1498
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:18,915
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

1499
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,209
-(squawking)
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1500
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,461
Not literally.

1501
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,004
I've got you, Alvin.

1502

01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,051
Oh, Theo.
Help!

01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:32,803
-(squawking)
-SIMON: Guys, it's a wedge-tailed eagle.

1507
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,181
Their only mortal enemy
is the pygmy elephant.

1508
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,849
Luckily, I speak a little pachyderm.

1509
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,809

1519
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,454
He's right.

1520
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,165
So, are we back
to one for all and three for one?

1521
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,251
Come on, Simon.
Hug it out.

1522
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,004
You know I'm sorry, Si.

1523
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,257
Si?

1524
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,177
Don't make me have to kiss you.
Because I'll do it.

1525
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,512
I don't care.

1526
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,889
Here come my lips.

1527
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,934
Make-out train is leaving the station.

I'll take that hug.

01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,731
Pinch me. Am I dreaming?
Oh, my gosh.

1542
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,065
Wait. Tonight?

1543
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,442
We'll miss the school contest.

1544
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,027
That is correct.

1545
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,820
You will miss the school contest.

1546
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,531
HAWKE: You're so smart.
I can never get anything passed you.

1547
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,451
It was never about
that stupid school contest.

1548
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:22,538
It was always about making
Brittany... a star.

1549
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:23,664
Oh.

1550
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,916
That's what you wanted, right?
(gasps)

1551
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,544
Well, yeah.

1552
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,838
Well, tonight's your big chance.

1553
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,590
It's all about you, Brittany.

1554
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,051
What about Jeanette and Eleanor?

1555
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,095
Yeah, well, they can sing backup.
I got them some stuff too.

1556
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,221
Hey!

1557
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,308
But, we're her sisters.

1558
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,811
And the three of us sing together
or not at all.

1559
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,772
-Okay, fine.
-Yes.

1560
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,273
All I really need is the "B" Girl.

1561
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,819
Ian, I won't do it without them.

1562
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,075
Okay, fine, fine.
Let's, uh, move on to Plan B.

1563
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,328
Um, okay.
Who likes barbecue?

1564
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,746
-Uh...
-Barbecue?

1565
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,083
Because I know this awesome little
barbecue restaurant in the Valley

1566
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,793
that makes the best roasted chipmunk.

1567
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:12,505
(sniffs, sighs)
Real tasty.

1568
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,091
Unless, of course, you want to sing.

1569
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,717
Oh.

1570
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,344
(sighs)

1571
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,265
(chattering)

1572
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,309
EMCEE: Welcome to West Eastman

1573
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:28,604
and thank you for supporting
music in our schools.

1574
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:33,692
Now, remember, the group you pick tonight
will win $25,000 for their school!

1575
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,653
(cheering)

1576
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:39,323
Now, we've got a lot of acts,
and we have to turn the heat off at 9:30,

1577
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:43,035
so without any further ado,
representing Orange Grove,

1578
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,372
put your hands together for Li'l Rosero!

1579
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,166

I'll take that.

I pocket-dialed 1-800-LOWLIFE.

What about the music department?

1601
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:40,634
The whole school is counting on you.

1602
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,929
<i>I know. I know.</i>
<i>I should have listened to you about Ian.</i>

1603
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,264
Don't tell me...

1604
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,933
Yep.
He locked us in a cage.

1605
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,810
HAWKE:
What? This is the biggest you have?

1606
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,729
I had my assistant call
and ask for the biggest limo.

1607
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:53,147
This is not the biggest limo you have.

1608
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,191
I'll, uh... I'll go break
the news to Dr. Rubin.

1609
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,736
-Brittany?
-Alvin, don't move.

1610
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,196
You got it.

1611
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,655
Brittany,
I'm coming to get you.

1612
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,782
Simon, tell Jeanette how to pick the lock.

1613
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,201
Roger that.

1614
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:08,037
Oh, man. I need to get to the girls. Fast.

1615
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,788
Oh! I know how.

1616
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,460

01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,929
Jeanette, focus.

1621
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,015
The third number is notoriously
the hardest to crack.

1622
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,309
I'm assuming it's a prime number,
but we can't assume--

1623
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:34,647
Simon! The first two numbers were ones.
I got to go with one.

1624
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:35,606
(gasps)
It opened!

1625
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:36,857
HAWKE:
All right, girls.

1626
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,859
Ian's coming. Put the phone back.
Hurry!

1627
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,694
Get ready to be fabulous.

1628
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:42,571
Oh, we're ready.

1629
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,615
Yeah, you better be,
'cause tonight's performance

1630
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:46,659
is going to put me back on top.

01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:25,739
How about a little moon-roof action?
Moon-roofs are go!

1641
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,825
Roofs? Moon-roofs?
Roofs? Roofs?

Ooh, champagne.
(chuckles)

1643
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,122
Don't mind if I do.

HAWKE:
You know why I don't mind if I do?

1645
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:41,255
Because tonight, we've gotta toast to
a very special someone

1646
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:43,590
named me.
(chuckles)

1647
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:48,012
They said I couldn't do it.
They said I'd never bounce back.

1648
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,764
Guess what? Time to kiss my sweet... Ooh.

HAWKE: Ah, yeah.
(champagne pouring)

1650
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:59,148
A toast... to the ladies who are going to
make the world forget about the Chipmun...

1651
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,278
-Wha...
-See ya!

1652
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,613
No! No, no, no! No!

Hi, Ian.
Good to see you.

1656
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:12,578
You never write.

-ALVIN: Come on, girls!

1659
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,791
No.
I signed a contract.

1660
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,293
Jump, Jeanette.
Uh...

No. No Alvin and no Chipettes.

Keep going!
What are you doing?

01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:26,735
Wait till I tell
everybody back home I saved Alvin Seville.

1683
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,154
I guess I owe you an apology about Ian.

1684
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,865
Stick with me, Britts.
I'll never steer you wrong.

I've got to say he
is definitely persistent.

1690
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,131
We have got to lose him.
Hang on!

1691

1692
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:52,136

really good with heights.

1696

Just hold on tight, Jeanette.

1697
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,936
Bring my girls right to me.

1698
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,438
We need the remote.

1699
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,481
Guys, I know what to do.

1700
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,150

01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:09,987

The remote!

1703
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,744
I can't reach it.

1704
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,705
I'm going for it.
Grab my ankles.

Hey, Ian!
You were wrong!

1712
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,805
I don't need these.

1713
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:38,932
Oops.

01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,478

Adios, Ian.

1718
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:51,487
And now for our final act of the night.

1719
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:53,989
Now, listen, we've had
a last second change to the lineup,

1720
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:56,533

gonna be too disappointed.

1721
01:14:56,617 --> 01:15:00,287
Representing West Eastman,
it's The Chipmunks!

1722

(cheering and applauding)

1723
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:07,920
We may have

1726
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,262
Well, if there are no Chipmunks,
we're going to have to move on.
