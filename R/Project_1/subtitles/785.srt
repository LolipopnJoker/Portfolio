1
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:35,018
Excuse me.

2
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,279
Shithead.

3
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,291
You shouldn't be here.

4
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,750
I know. Ask for at
least $1,000, okay?

5
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,733
I'll get as much
as I can. You hide.

6
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,696
His wife took his kid
and a couple of million...

7
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,737
and we won't get a thousand.

8
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,259
Shut up and stay hidden.

9
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,801
I told him I was coming alone.

10
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,828
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

11
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:07,479
How's it going?

12
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:10,428
You said you had information
about my family.

13
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,670
Yeah, yeah, I do.

14
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,165
Well, let's have it.

15
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, it's going to cost you.

16
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,703
Like $1,000?

17
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:28,441
Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

18
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:30,046
750 would be fine.

19
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,313
I mean, more than fine.

20
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,885
Just tell me what
you have, Danny...

21
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,911
and I'll take good care of you.

22
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,141
Okay.

23
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:41,642
That sounds fair.

24
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:44,464
I was doing a delivery
for Corky last week

25
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:45,863
out of state...

26
00:04:45,898 --> 00:04:47,718
and I ran into your ex.

27
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,075
How'd she look?

28
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:51,849
She looked great,
Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

29
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:54,165
She changed her hair and stuff...

30
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,979
but she looked like
a million dollars.

31
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,095
In fact, she looked like
about $3 million.

32
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,031
Did she see you?

33
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,381
No. I was
changing a tire...

34
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,879
and suddenly, there she was
across the street...

35
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,861
taking her kid into this school.

36
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:12,591
My boy?

37
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:13,932
Looked great.

38
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,507
He looked very healthy.

39
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:18,852
It's a real nice, healthy place
where they're living.

40
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:20,672
It snows in winter there.

41
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:22,222
Danny...

42
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:25,577
where are they?

43
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:28,945
At the school where I saw them...

44
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,405
Astoria Elementary School.

45
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:32,784
That's...

46
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,479
It's in Astoria, Oregon.

47
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:37,716
All right.

48
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:40,081
Did you tell anyone else this?

49
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,180
No.

50
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,369
No way.

51
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,590
Hey, I'm not stupid,
Mr. Crisp.

52
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,639
You're not?

53
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:06,203
Danny.

54
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,049
Danny! No!

55
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,124
Danny!

56
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:12,937
Danny!

57
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:14,244
Get up!

58
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:18,225
Don't you die on me!

59
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,872
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.

60
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,451
Was it Crisp?

61
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,192
I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

62
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:28,387
What are you doing?

63
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,477
Hey, hey, hey!

64
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:32,043
Stop it! Don't do that!

65
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:33,586
Don't go anywhere.

66
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:34,921
Let me go!

67
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:36,782
No! Let me off of him!

68
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,901
I don't like what you've done.

69
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,468
I really don't like it.

70
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:42,931
It feels terrible,
and it looks dreadful.

71
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:44,473
I'm trying my best.

72
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,453
Maybe your best isn't good enough.

73
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm back.

74
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,461
Oh, great.
Well, that was fast.

75
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,100
It was easy.

76
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,606
I have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

77
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,629
Oh, you always exaggerate, Cullen.

78
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,633
Everything is always
great, terrific.

79
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,634
So, what's so great?

80
00:06:59,655 --> 00:07:02,155
I just found out
where they're hiding.

81
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:05,181
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

82
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,345
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

83
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:10,312
Oh, how could I say no to you?

84
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,624
Tell me.

85
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,045
What's happened?

86
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:15,905
Just let me
handle this myself, Mother.

87
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:17,863
I know what I'm doing.

88
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,543
Everything is under control.

89
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,913
It's all right.
I'm a police officer.

90
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:31,476
Crisp, you're under arrest.

91
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,058
Put your hands on your head

92
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,644
and get up!

93
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,149
Kimble, not again!

94
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:37,149
Your hands!

95
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,210
They're up.

96
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,014
When will you leave me alone?

97
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,330
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

98
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:43,985
Hey, I'm a police officer.

99
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:45,492
This is an arrest.

100
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:47,552
This man's crazy.
Look at him.

101
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:50,159
He'll kill me.
You're just going to stand there?

102
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,066
Freeze!

103
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:53,332
I'm a cop!

104
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,353
I'm Detective John Kimble.

105
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,836
This man is under arrest.

106
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:57,878
I'm checking.

107
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,819
You can't just walk in here

108
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,339
and put a gun in my face.

109
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,243
I'm trying to get a manicure.

110
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:05,802
I have witnesses.

111
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,225
I have a witness, too.

112
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:10,806
It's murder one this time.

113
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:12,192
Now you're mine.

114
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:16,701
The bastard handcuffed me
to a dead man!

115
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,190
A dead man!

116
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,691
Come on. Sit down.

117
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,592
Now, did Danny ever say

118
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,552
what Crisp's wife looked like?

119
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:25,153
No.

120
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:28,337
Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

121
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:29,951
He didn't say anything.

122
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:32,414
Look, I just want to go home.

123
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,876
After the lineup,
I'll drive you home.

124
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,417
I'll even buy you dinner.

125
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,919
I'll even cook you dinner.

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm not doing any lineup...

127
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:43,302
and there ain't jack shit
you can do about it!

128
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:45,922
I've been after Crisp
for four years...

129
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,390
and she's letting
my key witness walk away?

130
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,770
Kimble, sit down!

131
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:50,825
Sit down.

132
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,068
- Sit.
- Sit.

133
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,311
Now listen to me.

134
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,812
He killed your boyfriend.

135
00:08:56,854 --> 00:08:59,274
All you have to do
is point your finger...

136
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,256
and we can put him away
for 30 years.

137
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:05,579
He wasn't my boyfriend.
I hardly knew the guy.

138
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:10,908
I know you're in there.

139
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:14,329
I know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.

140
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:16,633
No lineup, no testimony.

141
00:09:16,707 --> 00:09:18,807
So shove your handcuffs
up your ass!

142
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,135
Now let me out of here!

143
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,351
Slow down!

144
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,399
Open it and let me out!

145
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,096
O'Hara, meet Kimble.

146
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:34,036
Kimble's been on this a long time.

147
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,099
Hi.

148
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,080
Let me take care of Cindy.

149
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,122
She'll make Crisp.
I guarantee it.

150
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,605
What are you going to do...

151
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,105
handcuff her to your car

152
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,087
and take her for a ride?

153
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:46,729
I'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner.

154
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,678
Kimble, hold on a second. I...

155
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:51,478
Difficult man.
Got to get to know him.

156
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,114
Oh, I can't wait.

157
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,995
Hey, baby.

158
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,037
What you mean, "Hey, baby"?

159
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:26,154
¿Dónde vas?

160
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,086
Shit!

161
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,658
Oh, excuse me.

162
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,159
I forgot to introduce myself.

163
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,619
My name is John Kimble...

164
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,686
and I love my car.

165
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,968
I'll keep an eye on it for you.

166
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:47,462
You got a beautiful ride.

167
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,005
Shit. Who does
he think he is?

168
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,830
He's lucky I didn't kick his ass.

169
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,250
Open up.

170
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,351
You can't come in.

171
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,545
Thank you.

172
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,612
What the fuck?

173
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:54,214
All right...

174
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:55,497
party's over.

175
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,390
Everyone go home.

176
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,639
Next time, my place.

177
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:03,963
So who are you, man?

178
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,178
Shit!

179
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,566
I'm the party-pooper.

180
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,712
Hi, Cindy.

181
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,739
Do you mind if I sit down?

182
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,022
No.

183
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:21,233
Sit down, man.

184
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,914
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

185
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:28,918
What are you doing here,
you asshole?

186
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,881
Cindy, I don't like you
using foul language...

187
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:34,443
not a classy girl like you.

188
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,427
Don't you have
anything better to do?

189
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:38,948
You don't understand.

190
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,250
I have nothing else to do...

191
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:44,105
and I have nowhere else to go.

192
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:47,703
Why are you staring
at me like that?

193
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,452
I like you, Cindy.

194
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,398
I'm going to be
around you a lot...

195
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:54,601
days, nights, weekends, holidays.

196
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,810
No.

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,340
No, you can't.

198
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,843
Yes, I can.

199
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:01,784
I'm going to hang out with you

200
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:03,867
until the end of time.

201
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:07,351
All right, move it in. Let's go.

202
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:09,496
Step onto the numbers.

203
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:11,991
Face front.

204
00:13:13,273 --> 00:13:16,493
Everybody, hands to your side.

205
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,310
That's the creep.

206
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,487
Who?

207
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:21,188
Number five.

208
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,780
That's him.

209
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,356
Good.

210
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,392
Very good.

211
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,370
Mr. Crisp, you will be
remanded into custody

212
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,919
until your trial.

213
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,740
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

214
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:37,296
Shh. Don't say anything.

215
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:38,759
Just take it easy.

216
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,339
I'll take care of it.
Trust me.

217
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,780
You know what to do?

218
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,307
I'm your mother, aren't I?

219
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,925
Mind if I talk
to my friend a little bit?

220
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,250
I'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

221
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:05,864
He's right in here.

222
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,540
You give me the names

223
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,521
of your drug suppliers
and distributors...

224
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,043
and I'll tell the judge

225
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,505
what a nice, cooperative killer
you are.

226
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:22,367
You think the jury's
going to convict me

227
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,887
on the testimony of that junkie?

228
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,949
You could be right.

229
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:34,177
But what about your wife?

230
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,768
You remember her?

231
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:38,191
All that hard-earned drug money

232
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:39,812
she stole from you?

233
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,799
How much was it...

234
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,561
$3 million?

235
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:46,911
I bet she would make
a much better witness.

236
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,413
Kimble, you've wasted years
chasing after me...

237
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,473
and what has it gotten you, hmm?

238
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:52,517
Nothing.

239
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,438
I'll be out in a week...

240
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:56,958
and you'll still be
eating take-out food

241
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,902
in that dump you live in.

242
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,899
Yeah, I know all
about you, Kimble.

243
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:05,026
Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

244
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:07,874
My old lady left
'cause of the money.

245
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,470
Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

246
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:16,186
I've never seen anyone so little

247
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,690
eat so much.

248
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,230
Yeah, I know.
I'm hypoglycemic.

249
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:20,773
If I don't eat regularly...

250
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:22,754
I get a little nuts.

251
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,756
So... where you from?

252
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:25,718
Austria.

253
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:28,637
How long you been a cop?

254
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,160
I been a cop for 12 years.

255
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:32,703
My father was a cop...

256
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,204
my brother was a cop...

257
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,186
my mother was a cop's wife.

258
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,428
And I have no hobbies.

259
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,400
You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

260
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:45,446
Locate Crisp's wife
and offer her immunity

261
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,009
in exchange for
her testimony against him.

262
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:49,513
No offense to O'Hallahan...

263
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:53,893
but this is my case,
and I work alone.

264
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,037
He works alone.

265
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:57,081
Not anymore.

266
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:58,562
She's going in undercover

267
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:01,143
as a substitute
kindergarten teacher.

268
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,611
Not exactly a job for you.

269
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,672
I used to be a teacher.

270
00:16:05,694 --> 00:16:07,152
We'll be fine.

271
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,693
What do I do?

272
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:09,916
She locates the kid...

273
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:12,368
you find the mother
and the cash...

274
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,870
and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

275
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,161
Bon voyage.

276
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:19,582
Oh, and, Kimble,
the name's O'Hara.

277
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,569
OK. Here's the wife at 17.

278
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,571
Real name's Rachel Myatt.

279
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,053
She's from Hannibal, Missouri,
class of '76.

280
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:32,275
Cheerleader, first violin

281
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:33,563
in the school orchestra...

282
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,536
captain of the girls'
softball team.

283
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:38,538
Her ambition was "To travel...

284
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:40,903
experience life...

285
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:42,398
and meet interesting people."

286
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:44,338
Like Crisp.

287
00:16:44,398 --> 00:16:45,458
Okay.

288
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:50,258
Relax.

289
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,259
Don't let him get to you.

290
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,931
That's her 10 years later.

291
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,413
It's a great shot of an ear.

292
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:00,956
You get in touch with her parents?

293
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,460
They're both dead.

294
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,240
The only relative
she's got left is the kid.

295
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,276
Hey.

296
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:14,591
Okay. This is the only picture
we have of him.

297
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,540
Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

298
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,620
That helps much.

299
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,541
It's the best I could do.

300
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:21,581
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

301
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:22,582
Please.

302
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:23,903
No. No, no.

303
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:25,237
That's a first.

304
00:17:27,357 --> 00:17:29,297
Listen, I was just thinking.

305
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,859
Maybe we should take a wild stab

306
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:33,885
at getting to know each other

307
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,887
before we have to pretend
we're married.

308
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:37,889
What do you want to know?

309
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:39,931
How long have we been married?

310
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,455
A long time.

311
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:44,596
People won't expect us
to talk much to each other.

312
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,608
I want to read it, too.

313
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:47,608
Stop it.

314
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:49,007
Please?

315
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,586
Let me take a look.

316
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,050
Hey, come here.

317
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,593
If you don't stop
screwing around back there...

318
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,977
this is what I'll do with you.

319
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:03,434
Ohh.

320
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:04,855
What's the matter?

321
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,194
I don't know.

322
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:08,329
I just don't feel so good.

323
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:09,606
You hungry?

324
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,387
I got to get out
of here right now.

325
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:15,264
Get those tree stumps
out of my way

326
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,383
before I vomit all over them.

327
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:23,781
Is your wife okay, sir?

328
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:26,012
Compared to what?

329
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,946
Maybe it was the burrito.

330
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:38,508
Or it could've been the sausages.

331
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,096
I don't think it was
the crab salad.

332
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:43,119
It couldn't
have been the doughnuts.

333
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:45,243
Excuse me.

334
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:49,448
Oh, I hate feeling like this.

335
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,345
I hate it, too.

336
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:54,883
Uh-oh.

337
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,402
Uh-oh what?

338
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,345
Uh-oh...

339
00:18:58,406 --> 00:18:59,466
pull over.

340
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,430
Now?

341
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,829
Yeah. Please hurry.

342
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,555
The key!

343
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,093
Give me the key!

344
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:50,767
Do you need a hand?

345
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,018
You okay?

346
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:13,202
I'm fine.

347
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,452
I'll be fine.

348
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,994
Class starts
at 9:00 in the morning.

349
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:32,622
I'll be fine.

350
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,565
You look much better already.

351
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,886
Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

352
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,424
That's why I quit teaching,
you know.

353
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,326
I got so sick
of other people's kids.

354
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:48,007
I was afraid that
I'd never want to have any

355
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:49,679
of my own.

356
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:57,423
I have a son.

357
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,145
He's 13.

358
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,614
I remember when he was 5.

359
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,557
He lives with his mother
and stepfather.

360
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:10,198
Aah!

361
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,186
What's the matter?

362
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:13,226
What...

363
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:14,227
is...

364
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:15,628
that?

365
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,126
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot to tell you.

366
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,630
This is my ferret.

367
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,690
He doesn't bite.
Don't worry.

368
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,307
Come on.
Come on out.

369
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:34,328
This is all I need...
an obstacle.

370
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,055
A goddamn obstacle.

371
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:38,283
He sends me an obstacle.

372
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:39,413
Here.

373
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,565
Oh, God.

374
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,960
Don't worry.

375
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:04,506
I'm going to make it.

376
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:07,848
I just need a minute.

377
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:10,868
I'll be ready in just a minute.

378
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:12,511
I just got...

379
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:16,096
Oh, God.

380
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:24,902
How do I look?

381
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,511
Take off the gun.

382
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,231
That's a good idea.

383
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:42,478
The little bastards
are going to eat you alive.

384
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,175
Get some rest, and don't worry.

385
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:49,195
I've been working undercover
for a long time.

386
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,760
They're 6-year-olds.

387
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,182
How much trouble can they be?

388
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:56,001
On second thought...

389
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:58,718
take the gun.

390
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:28,162
Matthew...

391
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:30,633
I sent you to
the principal's office

392
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,216
because you punched Jenny.

393
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,279
I know. She poisoned
your hamsters.

394
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:37,327
She told me all about it...

395
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:38,849
and she's very sorry.

396
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:42,351
And I'm sorry that
I didn't believe you.

397
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:46,874
- But you shouldn't punch people.
- But she...

398
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:49,762
Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski
will see you now.

399
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:52,689
Let's go back to class.

400
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,617
Can I help you?

401
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,720
I'm John Kimble,
your new kindergarten teacher.

402
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,470
We were expecting a Miss O'Hara.

403
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:09,405
There's been a change of plan.

404
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,116
Four weeks into
the new semester...

405
00:24:13,175 --> 00:24:17,075
my superintendent told me
I had to replace Mrs. Hagley...

406
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,560
a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience...

407
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:22,662
with an undercover
police officer...

408
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:25,146
and he wouldn't even tell me why.

409
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:28,128
I don't suppose you
would do me the courtesy

410
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:29,731
of filling me in.

411
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,194
I can't do that.

412
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:32,254
Oh.

413
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:34,257
You can't do that.

414
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,820
I'm watching you.

415
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:38,284
All I have to do
is tell my parents

416
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:40,304
that you're with the police...

417
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:41,826
and they'll yank their kids

418
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,889
out of this school so fast...

419
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:45,415
we'd have to close.

420
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:47,196
And don't you think I won't

421
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,670
if I feel my children
are in any danger.

422
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,975
They're not in danger.

423
00:24:54,924 --> 00:24:59,824
I assume you have
some teaching experience.

424
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,472
They wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

425
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,865
Just wait here a minute.

426
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:24,584
Everybody sit down on the carpet!

427
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,968
Good morning, everyone.

428
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:36,668
Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

429
00:25:36,757 --> 00:25:38,777
Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley

430
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:41,782
had to go on an important trip.

431
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:43,025
Where'd she go?

432
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,555
That doesn't matter.

433
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:45,898
Did she die?

434
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:49,113
No, Lowell.
She went to see someone.

435
00:25:49,186 --> 00:25:50,566
Did they die?

436
00:25:50,604 --> 00:25:52,704
No, Lowell.

437
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,713
Everyone dies, you know.

438
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:58,753
I know, but not
for a long, long time.

439
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,604
Now, until Mrs. Hagley
comes back...

440
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:05,238
we have someone special to help.

441
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,549
This is Mr. Kimble...

442
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:10,201
your new kindergarten teacher.

443
00:26:17,797 --> 00:26:23,377
Now, let's everybody say,
"Good morning, Mr. Kimble."

444
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:27,813
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

445
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:29,432
Good morning.

446
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:32,296
They're all yours.

447
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:34,415
I'll be watching you.

448
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,279
Hi.

449
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,699
How are you?

450
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:50,225
I'm very happy to be here.

451
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:53,228
First I would like
to just get to know you.

452
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:00,625
Quiet.

453
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:05,535
I'm going to ask you
a bunch of questions.

454
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:08,535
I want to have them
answered immediately.

455
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:11,538
How many of you
were born in Astoria?

456
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:17,185
Raise your hands.
Let's see them.

457
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,990
Okay, hmm.

458
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:25,207
Now, anyone that was not
born in Astoria...

459
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:26,984
somewhere outside
like California...

460
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:28,612
raise your hands.

461
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:37,792
Yes.

462
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:40,373
I need to go to the bathroom.

463
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:43,494
Okay. You can go.

464
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:46,657
Boys have a penis.

465
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:49,139
Girls have a vagina.

466
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,307
Thanks for the tip.

467
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:56,701
Yes?

468
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:59,148
I need to go to the bathroom...

469
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:01,771
and I can't get these things off.

470
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,786
I'll get someone to help you.

471
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,927
I'll be right back, okay?

472
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:24,246
You've learned that
the "e" is often silent

473
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,959
when it immediately
follows another vowel.

474
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,508
Now write and say these words...

475
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,480
Oh, um...

476
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:34,975
class, uh, Catherine...

477
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:37,916
can you take over for me, please?

478
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,199
Thank you.

479
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,190
"E" is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.

480
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:44,853
Yes, can I help you?

481
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,359
I have a problem.

482
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:49,025
Mr. Kimble...

483
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,930
I need to go real bad.

484
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,576
First day?

485
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:56,197
Yes.

486
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,745
I'll take care of her.

487
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:58,929
Thank you.

488
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,455
You know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.

489
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:06,727
Don't turn your back on it.

490
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:08,498
They're okay.

491
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,209
Don't worry.

492
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:11,919
Everything is under control.

493
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,759
No.

494
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:18,187
Monsters.

495
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,071
What are you doing with this?

496
00:29:45,294 --> 00:29:47,754
Aren't you going to break it up?

497
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:49,776
No. Two more days of this...

498
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,740
and he'll quit.

499
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:03,984
Shut up!

500
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:07,582
Shut up! Shut up!

501
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:09,548
Shut up.

502
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,115
No.

503
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:17,616
Don't start this.

504
00:30:29,796 --> 00:30:32,256
Aah!

505
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:49,528
Attention!

506
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:56,783
This is your new class mascot.

507
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,926
What happened to your dog?

508
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:01,332
This is not a dog.

509
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:02,871
This is a ferret.

510
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,372
What's a ferret?

511
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:05,792
That's a ferret.

512
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,332
Oh!

513
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,313
If he bites you,
you get rabies and die.

514
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,118
No. That's not true.

515
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,671
He never bites.

516
00:31:13,673 --> 00:31:15,133
Can I pet him?

517
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:18,074
Sure, but one at a time, okay?

518
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,997
Good. Okay, next one.
Come on.

519
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:22,877
Yes.

520
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,224
Good.

521
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:25,485
Yeah.

522
00:31:26,894 --> 00:31:28,874
Good. Now we're having fun.

523
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,840
What's that supposed to mean?

524
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,702
Mrs. Hagley
is a lot better than you.

525
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:01,502
Is she?

526
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,421
Is she really?

527
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,291
My mom's a teacher
in this school...

528
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,894
and she's a lot better
than you, too.

529
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,080
Great.

530
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,246
On Monday nights, my mom tutors

531
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:17,737
and Mrs. Quinn
takes care of me.

532
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,599
She's better than you, too.

533
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:21,235
Great.

534
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,221
And Frankie,
my swimming teacher...

535
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:27,661
and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

536
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,354
I really appreciate your honesty.

537
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,876
You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

538
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:40,903
I don't know that many people.

539
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,710
John?

540
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,432
Are you there?

541
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,644
How did it go?

542
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:06,458
Go away.

543
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:08,754
It went that well, huh?

544
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:13,278
You take over tomorrow.

545
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:15,794
And blow our cover?

546
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:17,457
Can't do it.

547
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,980
They're horrible.

548
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:23,108
Tell me about it.

549
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:41,025
He's gay.

550
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:43,726
What kind of a man
teaches kindergarten?

551
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,321
He's obviously gay.

552
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:48,624
A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what I'm used to.

553
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:50,802
Samantha calls him
"The giant."

554
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,790
There he is.

555
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:55,892
Where, honey?

556
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:02,658
Holy cow, is that
your new teacher?

557
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:03,896
Yeah.

558
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,504
Oh, my God.

559
00:34:06,427 --> 00:34:07,847
What are you doing?

560
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:10,586
- I'm not wearing makeup.
- None of us are.

561
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,101
You're married.
You're allowed to look like slobs.

562
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:16,563
Be good. I'll be back
to pick you up.

563
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,147
Good morning,
Mr. Kimble.

564
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,168
Good morning.

565
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,649
I told you he was big.

566
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,713
Play with the kids, honey.

567
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:28,345
Hi. I'm Jillian,
Sylvester's mom.

568
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,385
Do you have a minute?

569
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,829
I'd like to speak with you.

570
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:34,371
Sure.

571
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,711
Please.

572
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:37,007
Thank you.

573
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,500
A male kindergarten teacher.

574
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,082
That's unusual.

575
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:44,038
You're not from
around here, are you?

576
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:46,069
No. I'm not.

577
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:47,592
Neither am I.

578
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,734
Huh.

579
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,423
Anyway...

580
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,891
um...

581
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:54,911
I have a small problem.

582
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:55,953
Yes?

583
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:57,435
You see, Sylvester's father

584
00:34:57,435 --> 00:34:59,895
doesn't live with us anymore...

585
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:02,838
and I've just been
worried about Sylvester.

586
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:05,721
He's been acting
a little strange lately...

587
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:07,838
You know, doing odd things.

588
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,071
Like what?

589
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:11,892
Well, it seems
that's he's becoming

590
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:14,891
a little obsessed
with playing with dolls.

591
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,454
You know, it's weird.

592
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:18,756
I think I can help you with that.

593
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:20,248
Really?

594
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:22,909
He uses the dolls
to look up girls' skirts.

595
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,422
I caught him doing it yesterday.

596
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,925
Oh. Oh, well,
that's a relief.

597
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:30,987
But I'll keep an eye on him, okay?

598
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:32,633
Thank you.

599
00:35:32,678 --> 00:35:35,218
Does Sylvester
ever see his father?

600
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:39,729
No. No, not since he was 2.

601
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:42,672
His father lives in California.

602
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,792
That is far away.

603
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:46,397
Mm-hmm.

604
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:49,582
Well, if you give me
his name and number...

605
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:51,635
I could talk to him

606
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,957
about taking
more interest in his son.

607
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:56,253
That's very kind,
but I don't think so.

608
00:35:56,285 --> 00:35:58,905
But it's tough on Sylvester,
don't you think?

609
00:35:58,996 --> 00:36:00,096
No.

610
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:01,982
No, what's tough on Sylvester

611
00:36:01,999 --> 00:36:04,459
is his father left us
for another man.

612
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:08,616
Are you married,
Mr. Kimble?

613
00:36:09,673 --> 00:36:11,173
No, I'm not.

614
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,559
He's not married, Mom!

615
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:19,181
Welcome to Astoria...

616
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,483
the single-parent capital
of America.

617
00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:23,378
Thank you for your time.

618
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,100
I pledge allegiance

619
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:28,489
to the flag

620
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:31,945
of the United States of America...

621
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:34,329
and to the republic

622
00:36:34,406 --> 00:36:36,346
for which it stands...

623
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:39,788
one nation, under God...

624
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,850
indivisible...

625
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:45,613
with liberty and justice for all.

626
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:53,941
Are these all your lunches?

627
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:58,325
You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

628
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,650
Stop it!

629
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:07,555
Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

630
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:10,589
We're going to play
a game called...

631
00:37:10,692 --> 00:37:13,792
"Who is my daddy
and what does he do?"

632
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:14,841
Yes?

633
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,482
Is your daddy a fireman?

634
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:18,991
He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

635
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:20,735
A basketball coach?

636
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:21,765
No, no.

637
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,886
What's the matter?

638
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,415
I have a headache.

639
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:27,195
It might be a tumor.

640
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,748
It's not a tumor!

641
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:31,211
It's not a tumor at all.

642
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,340
What I meant was...

643
00:37:34,382 --> 00:37:37,322
you tell me who is your daddy

644
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,245
and what does he do?

645
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:40,603
Oh.

646
00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:42,597
Get it?

647
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:44,258
We start right here. You.

648
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:49,288
My dad repairs cars
driven by women who are pinheads.

649
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:56,867
My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

650
00:37:57,071 --> 00:38:00,771
My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money...

651
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,768
then people use that money...

652
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:05,246
then they give other money back

653
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:07,589
and they give the same amount

654
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:09,925
of money back to my dad.

655
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,700
My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

656
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:15,973
He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

657
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,070
My mom hopes he's going to die
real soon.

658
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:26,247
My dad watches TV all day long.

659
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:31,170
My dad works on computers...

660
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:36,175
and he's, um, the boss
of his company...

661
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,220
and, um, he has a mustache
and a beard.

662
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:41,343
Mm-hmm.

663
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:42,584
Yeah.

664
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:46,767
He doesn't have that
much hair because...

665
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,250
and he...
his head is so big

666
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:51,789
that he can't wear any hats.

667
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,813
My dad's divorced.

668
00:38:53,877 --> 00:38:56,097
My mom's divorced.

669
00:38:56,129 --> 00:38:58,789
My dad, um, is a psychologist...

670
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:01,782
and he helps people that are hurt

671
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:03,785
or lost their feelings...

672
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,063
and, um, that's it.

673
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:08,799
Our mom says that our dad

674
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,590
is a real sex machine.

675
00:39:16,482 --> 00:39:18,102
Good.

676
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:21,051
I don't know what my dad does.

677
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:23,974
I haven't seen him in a long time.

678
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,653
He lives in France.

679
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:30,162
My dad is a gynecologist...

680
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:33,744
and he looks at vaginas
all day long.

681
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:38,784
Mi papá trabaja en la casa...

682
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,900
y él juega conmigo mucho.

683
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:44,188
Thank you.
Very good.

684
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,880
Okay. Next, uh...

685
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,628
What's his name
with his back to me?

686
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,061
His name's Zach Sullivan.

687
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,359
He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

688
00:39:52,435 --> 00:39:53,895
He's a poo-poo head.

689
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:55,556
He's a poo-poo face.

690
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,704
He's a ca-ca poo-poo.

691
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:00,273
He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

692
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,259
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

693
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:05,782
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

694
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:06,845
Quiet.

695
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:07,886
That's enough.

696
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:12,592
Hey, Zach.

697
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:15,361
Did your daddy
teach you this game?

698
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:20,693
Come on, Zach.
Let's all play together.

699
00:40:20,796 --> 00:40:22,736
It's so much more fun.

700
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:24,096
Leave me alone!

701
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:26,531
What's that?

702
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,220
It's a fire alarm!

703
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:30,601
Come on, come on.

704
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:33,354
Everyone together!
Come on.

705
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:34,725
I'm on fire!

706
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,386
Come on. All together!

707
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:37,776
I'm on fire!

708
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,067
Very straight.
Very straight.

709
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,373
Come on, come on.
Get all together.

710
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,279
Everything together.
Come on.

711
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,358
Come on. Quiet.

712
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,883
Quiet! Come on.

713
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,265
Shh! Quiet.

714
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:10,884
Well, we're all glad

715
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:14,029
the kindergarten class
could join us.

716
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,726
That's four minutes.

717
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,268
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

718
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:22,785
All the other grades...

719
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:24,797
your times were an improvement...

720
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:27,834
but they're still not good enough.

721
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:30,082
I'm very disappointed.

722
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:33,854
All right, let's get
back into school.

723
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:57,987
Mrs. Sullivan!

724
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,743
Mrs. Sullivan!

725
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:10,967
So the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.

726
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,090
I'm fine. I can
eat anything I want.

727
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,658
Let's find a restaurant.

728
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:17,159
Can we talk business?

729
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,621
There are 14 boys
in the classroom.

730
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:23,083
So far I have three possible
suspects, one likely.

731
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,027
Here's a picture.
You listening?

732
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,465
I'm listening.

733
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,483
His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

734
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,485
He's cute.
Doesn't anybody eat around here?

735
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,410
Listen, he's a dead ringer
for Crisp. Look.

736
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,899
Maybe. Come on, John.
I'm hungry.

737
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:41,356
A table for two.
Thank you very much.

738
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:42,893
Two hot dogs.

739
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,394
Two hot dogs?

740
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,896
Mr. Kimble!
Mr. Kimble!

741
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:46,919
Dominic.

742
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,560
It's him, Mom.

743
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,068
Joyce.

744
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,193
Hello, Joyce.

745
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,534
Dominic has been a great help.

746
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,193
He's a good kid.

747
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,240
Who's that?

748
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,241
Who?

749
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,862
Her.

750
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:59,930
Oh, that?

751
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:01,653
Uh, that is, uh...

752
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:04,045
I am his sister.

753
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:05,104
Oh, really?

754
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,585
I wouldn't have guessed.

755
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,406
You have to excuse my brother.

756
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,878
He has no manners.

757
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,339
My name is Ursula.
Wonderful to meet you.

758
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,402
I'm visiting here from Austria.

759
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:17,366
I'm Joyce Paulmarie.
I work at John's school.

760
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,530
Ah.

761
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:19,935
And this is Dominic.

762
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,390
Nice to meet you.

763
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,331
Would you like
to join us for dinner?

764
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,854
- No.
- Ja.

765
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,062
Ja.

766
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,843
Yes, of course.
That would be great.

767
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,799
Hi. There will
be four of us.

768
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,122
Table 27.

769
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,293
Why did you tell her
you were my sister?

770
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:40,707
Relax, butch.
The love doctor is here.

771
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,205
Come to me.
I want to start.

772
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,306
Okay. I want
a rib eye steak

773
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,875
with mashed potatoes

774
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,857
and a large green salad.

775
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,379
Oh, no.
Wait a minute.

776
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,920
I want to start

777
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,502
with the spicy chicken wings.

778
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,175
Are they the tiny ones
without meat?

779
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,200
Actually, it's quite
a large serving.

780
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,596
Ah, good.

781
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,097
Ooh, good arms.

782
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,199
And a large bowl
of the clam chowder.

783
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,613
Uh, and the blueberry pie

784
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,467
with ice cream for dessert.

785
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,622
Ja.

786
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,611
I like how they talk.

787
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,194
I've been trying to get to
know the parents...

788
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,623
but some of them are avoiding me.

789
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,162
Some of them are like that.

790
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,144
It's a strange town that way...

791
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,664
especially with new arrivals.

792
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:29,665
What do you mean?

793
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,806
I think a lot of people

794
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,337
that come to small towns

795
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,157
are trying to get
away from something

796
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,992
or they're hiding something.

797
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,189
Like what?

798
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,451
Well, for example,
what brought you here?

799
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,494
Me? Well,
there was an opening

800
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,176
for a kindergarten teacher.

801
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:48,924
Yeah, but what made you
become a kindergarten teacher?

802
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,397
I mean, it is a bit unusual.

803
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,100
John is a bit unusual.

804
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,128
Well...

805
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,129
You are.

806
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,530
I was born in Austria.

807
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,028
My father was a teacher.

808
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,487
My mother was a teacher.

809
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,628
So is Ursula.

810
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:01,835
Ja.

811
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,685
We have a tradition in Austria

812
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,402
where we follow
the footsteps of our parents.

813
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:08,834
So when I moved to this country...

814
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,214
I taught geography

815
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,550
and physical education
in Arizona...

816
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,406
and then I coached basketball

817
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,441
at an all-girls school
in Rhode Island, but...

818
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:21,371
none of it made me really happy.

819
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,608
Why weren't you happy?

820
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:26,018
Ja. Why weren't you happy?

821
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:29,728
Well, I got tired of
teaching teenagers...

822
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,189
because by the time
they came to me...

823
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:35,650
I felt there wasn't much
I could do with them.

824
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,832
I realized that the real
action is in kindergarten.

825
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,003
How long have you been
teaching kindergarten?

826
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,850
It's my second day.

827
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:44,284
Oh.

828
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,787
Ooh, excuse me, but it's good.

829
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:51,452
It is good.

830
00:45:51,497 --> 00:45:52,477
Thanks again.

831
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:54,718
Nice to meet you.

832
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:55,772
Thank you.

833
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:57,453
Bye.

834
00:45:57,503 --> 00:45:58,923
I had a great time.

835
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:00,423
Ja, me, too.

836
00:46:00,423 --> 00:46:03,483
Well, Kimble, I think you scored.

837
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:07,979
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

838
00:46:08,014 --> 00:46:09,431
What are you talking about?

839
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:10,890
I'm only interested in her

840
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:12,911
because she works at the school.

841
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:14,875
She knows the children
and the parents.

842
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:16,315
If you were any stiffer...

843
00:46:16,355 --> 00:46:17,730
we could take you surfing.

844
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:19,711
Now, I know you like that woman.

845
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:20,993
What is your problem?

846
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:22,446
The only problem I've got

847
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:24,626
is that I'm doing your job.

848
00:46:24,697 --> 00:46:26,637
You should be cleaning up the paint

849
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:28,700
and reading stories about
bears that go shopping.

850
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:30,401
I'm stuck with your job.

851
00:46:30,411 --> 00:46:31,831
Yeah. You are.

852
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,770
That's right. I am.

853
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:36,251
Look, you're going
to be out of here

854
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,793
in a few days.

855
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:40,695
You told me yourself you
had a few good leads.

856
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:42,974
You'll be back dealing
with junkies and murderers

857
00:46:43,048 --> 00:46:44,148
in no time.

858
00:46:55,352 --> 00:46:57,772
They're pushing me around.

859
00:46:57,813 --> 00:46:59,513
Who?

860
00:46:59,564 --> 00:47:00,704
The kids.

861
00:47:01,983 --> 00:47:04,483
They're walking all over me.

862
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:12,284
Listen, Kimble.

863
00:47:12,285 --> 00:47:13,705
You got to handle this

864
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:15,205
like any other police situation.

865
00:47:15,247 --> 00:47:17,667
You walk into it showing fear...

866
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:19,449
you're dead...

867
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:22,279
and those kids know you're scared.

868
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,470
No fear.

869
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:31,313
No fear.

870
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:36,792
Today we're going to play
a new fun game.

871
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:39,631
It's called "police school."

872
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,627
I'm going to be your sheriff.

873
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:44,948
You're going to be
my deputy trainees.

874
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:48,153
Come on.

875
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:49,414
Stop whining.

876
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:53,062
You kids are soft.

877
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:54,857
You lack discipline.

878
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,496
Well, I've got news for you.

879
00:47:57,497 --> 00:48:00,117
You are mine now.
You belong to me!

880
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:04,071
You're not going to have
your mommies here

881
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:05,268
to wipe your tushies.

882
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:06,596
Oh, no.

883
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:09,331
It's time to turn
this mush into muscles.

884
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,011
No more complaining.

885
00:48:13,012 --> 00:48:15,512
No more, "I have to go
to the bathroom."

886
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:18,549
There is no bathroom!

887
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:25,361
Now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn

888
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:28,542
is to freeze whenever
you hear this.

889
00:48:31,697 --> 00:48:34,397
Now, the next time you
hear this whistle...

890
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,751
each one of you get one toy.

891
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:37,807
How many?

892
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,130
One!

893
00:48:39,163 --> 00:48:41,183
Good. Then bring it
back to the carpet...

894
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:42,248
pronto.

895
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:43,309
Ready?

896
00:48:44,251 --> 00:48:45,871
Wait for it.

897
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:47,859
Wait for it.

898
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,620
Sit down.

899
00:48:50,632 --> 00:48:52,212
Ready?

900
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:54,115
Go quickly.

901
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:55,116
Get your toy.

902
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:56,157
Go.

903
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:57,319
Go for it.

904
00:48:57,347 --> 00:48:59,247
Yes. Very fast.

905
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:00,406
Good. Quickly.

906
00:49:00,434 --> 00:49:02,614
Bring the toy back to the carpet.

907
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:04,946
Bring it back to the carpet.

908
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,230
Quick, quick, quick.

909
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:08,131
Back to the carpet.

910
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:09,451
Quickly.

911
00:49:12,237 --> 00:49:13,497
Emma.

912
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:16,615
Emma...

913
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:18,796
take your toy to the carpet.

914
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:22,688
I'm not a policeman.
I'm a princess.

915
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:25,329
Take your toy back to the carpet.

916
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,170
I'm not a policeman!

917
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,311
I'm a princess.

918
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:30,997
Take it back!

919
00:49:32,048 --> 00:49:33,948
All right.

920
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:43,591
Very good.

921
00:49:43,643 --> 00:49:45,143
You did very well.

922
00:49:45,144 --> 00:49:47,484
Now we're going to
play another game.

923
00:49:47,563 --> 00:49:50,063
When you hear two whistle blows...

924
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:52,968
take your toy back where you got it

925
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:54,649
and come right back.

926
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:56,356
How many whistle blows?

927
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:57,546
- Two!
- Two!

928
00:49:57,573 --> 00:49:59,353
Good. Ready?

929
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:02,177
Go.

930
00:50:02,203 --> 00:50:03,383
Come on.

931
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:05,632
Come right back to the carpet.

932
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:07,166
Yes. It works.

933
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:08,166
This is great.

934
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:09,667
Faster, faster.

935
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,794
Come on.

936
00:50:10,795 --> 00:50:12,295
Yes. Come back. Terrific.

937
00:50:12,296 --> 00:50:13,676
This is working. Wait.

938
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:17,471
I mean, you're very good deputies.

939
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:22,618
Your sheriff is proud of you.

940
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:32,539
1, 2, 3, 4.

941
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:34,548
1, 2, 3, 4.

942
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,550
1, 2, 3, 4.

943
00:50:36,612 --> 00:50:38,392
1, 2, 3, 4.

944
00:50:42,993 --> 00:50:46,013
Wait! Take me.

945
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:48,701
Down. Up. Down.

946
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:50,251
Yes, yes, yes!

947
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:51,392
You've got it.

948
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:54,479
Yes, Wanda. Good.

949
00:50:56,173 --> 00:50:57,553
Very good.

950
00:50:57,591 --> 00:50:59,651
Big circles. Big circles.

951
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:00,898
Good.

952
00:51:00,928 --> 00:51:03,228
Now do the same thing.
Way back.

953
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:04,885
And down in big circles.

954
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:05,951
Big circles.

955
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:17,458
Yes.

956
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:27,508
This is a fire drill!

957
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:29,397
This is a fire drill.

958
00:51:29,414 --> 00:51:30,474
Run to the door.

959
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,347
Dominic, don't forget Ferret.

960
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:36,197
Yes. It's a fire drill.

961
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:37,272
Come on.

962
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:40,903
Oh, this is terrible.

963
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:43,507
Come on. Come on.

964
00:51:44,888 --> 00:51:47,268
29.

965
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:48,724
30.

966
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:50,585
31.

967
00:51:50,643 --> 00:51:52,303
32.

968
00:51:52,353 --> 00:51:54,373
33.

969
00:51:54,397 --> 00:51:55,439
One more.

970
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,780
Come on.
Down and up.

971
00:51:57,859 --> 00:51:58,839
Yes!

972
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,840
Yes!

973
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:01,111
Zach is the winner.

974
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:02,732
Come on, you guys.

975
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:11,932
March, 2, 3, 4.

976
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:13,978
March, 2, 3, 4.

977
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,101
Swing your arms.

978
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:16,746
2, 3, 4.

979
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:19,212
Swing them high.
2, 3, 4.

980
00:52:19,255 --> 00:52:21,395
1, 2, 3, 4.

981
00:52:21,465 --> 00:52:23,765
1, 2, 3, 4.

982
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:25,939
Wow.

983
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,110
1, 2, 3, 4!

984
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,640
Reading, writing, arithmetic.

985
00:52:29,682 --> 00:52:32,542
Reading, writing, arithmetic!

986
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:34,821
Too much homework makes me sick.

987
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:37,075
Too much homework makes me sick!

988
00:52:37,106 --> 00:52:39,486
When it's time to pass the test...

989
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,947
When it's time to pass the test...

990
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:44,127
kindergarten is the best.

991
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:46,256
Kindergarten is the best.

992
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:48,503
Yay!

993
00:52:48,575 --> 00:52:51,555
E-I-E-I-O

994
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:56,200
And on that farm he had a duck

995
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,315
E-I-E-I-O

996
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,110
All right.
Take your milk.

997
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,633
It makes you big and strong.

998
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:13,056
It's story time, Mr. Kimble.

999
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,040
All right.

1000
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,519
We all like this one...

1001
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,979
and if you read us a story now...

1002
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:20,001
everybody will go to sleep.

1003
00:53:20,023 --> 00:53:21,083
All right.

1004
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:34,453
I used to read this to my son.

1005
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:35,663
What's his name?

1006
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:36,604
Who?

1007
00:53:36,623 --> 00:53:38,523
Your son.

1008
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:41,201
Oh, Alex is his name.

1009
00:53:41,294 --> 00:53:42,754
Where is he?

1010
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,696
He lives with his mother.

1011
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,883
You see, his mother and I...

1012
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:55,914
we are...

1013
00:53:55,934 --> 00:53:57,554
Divorced. I know.

1014
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,182
What's a divorce?

1015
00:53:59,228 --> 00:54:02,048
It's when your daddy
lives someplace else

1016
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:04,048
and comes over
to take you places...

1017
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,728
and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.

1018
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:08,439
No. It's when the daddy

1019
00:54:08,488 --> 00:54:11,028
doesn't want to see
his little boy anymore.

1020
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:12,615
That's not what it is.

1021
00:54:12,658 --> 00:54:15,318
Why don't you want to see
your little boy?

1022
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:16,469
Was he bad?

1023
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:18,595
No, he was not bad.

1024
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:23,513
It wasn't his fault at all.

1025
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:24,768
You see...

1026
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:28,015
his mommy and I, we just nev...

1027
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,539
Just sit down, okay?

1028
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,390
Let me just start reading.

1029
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:43,897
Why don't you all lie down?

1030
00:54:43,939 --> 00:54:44,999
Okay.

1031
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:47,731
Good. And rest.

1032
00:54:50,904 --> 00:54:54,324
"If you were a bird
and lived on high

1033
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:58,308
you'd lean on the wind
when the wind came by.

1034
00:54:58,454 --> 00:55:01,274
You'd say to the wind
when it took you away...

1035
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:03,873
That's where I wanted to go today.

1036
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,150
Where am I going?
I don't quite know.

1037
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:12,436
What does it matter
where people go?

1038
00:55:12,551 --> 00:55:16,091
Down to the wood
where the bluebells grow.

1039
00:55:16,221 --> 00:55:17,638
Anywhere.

1040
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:19,339
Anywhere.

1041
00:55:19,391 --> 00:55:20,931
I don't know."

1042
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,191
Huh!

1043
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,486
Hi.

1044
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:06,663
Hi.

1045
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,441
I didn't mean to startle you.

1046
00:56:18,115 --> 00:56:20,855
I must have dozed off.

1047
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:23,932
I can't believe you
got them all to sleep.

1048
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,661
I worked them hard.

1049
00:56:28,376 --> 00:56:30,036
I was wondering if...

1050
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,506
you'd like to come
to my place for dinner

1051
00:56:32,546 --> 00:56:33,886
tomorrow night.

1052
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:37,853
I would like that.

1053
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,547
Yes.

1054
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:40,678
Great.

1055
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:42,739
Well, here are the directions.

1056
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,427
How about 6:30, 7:00?

1057
00:56:45,726 --> 00:56:47,266
That would be fine.

1058
00:56:53,192 --> 00:56:54,292
What?

1059
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:56,294
Um...

1060
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:00,481
You... You've got
a little mustache.

1061
00:57:00,532 --> 00:57:03,832
Oh, it must be from the milk.

1062
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,480
Well, I'd better
get back to class.

1063
00:57:14,504 --> 00:57:16,444
I'll see you tomorrow.

1064
00:57:16,506 --> 00:57:18,086
See you tomorrow.

1065
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,750
Freeze!

1066
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:15,916
No!

1067
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:19,602
No.

1068
00:58:19,652 --> 00:58:22,032
This is Henry Shoop...

1069
00:58:22,113 --> 00:58:23,973
my fiancé.

1070
00:58:25,449 --> 00:58:26,549
Hi.

1071
00:58:27,577 --> 00:58:28,557
Your fiancé?

1072
00:58:28,578 --> 00:58:30,318
Yeah, my fiancé.

1073
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:33,751
Henry, this is
obviously my partner...

1074
00:58:33,874 --> 00:58:35,014
John Kimble.

1075
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,022
Oh, jeez.

1076
00:58:36,043 --> 00:58:37,503
Uh...

1077
00:58:37,545 --> 00:58:38,525
Hi.

1078
00:58:38,546 --> 00:58:39,838
How you doing?

1079
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,059
Let me get this...

1080
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,430
and I'll be right out.

1081
00:58:42,466 --> 00:58:43,446
Oh!

1082
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:44,967
It's okay, honey.

1083
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,510
I'll be right out.

1084
00:58:46,554 --> 00:58:48,012
It's my birthday.

1085
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:49,353
Well, congratulations.

1086
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,290
Thanks. He came up here
just to surprise me.

1087
00:58:52,393 --> 00:58:55,773
And he made me my favorite...
pasta a olio.

1088
00:59:01,568 --> 00:59:03,828
I love you, Henry.

1089
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:05,196
I love you, too, Phoebes.

1090
00:59:05,197 --> 00:59:08,017
Uh... Well, I've got
to head back tonight.

1091
00:59:08,117 --> 00:59:09,577
I've got to work.

1092
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:11,198
Henry's a chef.

1093
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:12,545
I'm a chef.

1094
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:14,039
You're marrying a chef?

1095
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:16,021
I'm marrying a great chef.

1096
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:17,103
That figures.

1097
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:19,345
You mean that, a great chef?

1098
00:59:19,419 --> 00:59:21,359
Of course.
You're a genius, Henry.

1099
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,280
Not just a good chef?

1100
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,800
Well, nice to meet you.

1101
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:26,133
Congratulations.
Happy birthday.

1102
00:59:26,134 --> 00:59:28,354
Thanks.
You want some of this?

1103
00:59:28,387 --> 00:59:29,527
It wasn't overcooked?

1104
00:59:29,554 --> 00:59:30,734
You're the best.

1105
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:32,144
It wasn't a little overcooked?

1106
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:33,562
No. Al dente.

1107
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,420
Zach.

1108
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:50,264
Excuse me. I'm John Kimble,
Zach's teacher.

1109
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:53,267
I didn't know he was following me.

1110
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:56,270
Hi. I've been leaving messages
on your machine.

1111
00:59:56,373 --> 00:59:58,793
I'm sorry.
Things have been hectic.

1112
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,815
What about now?

1113
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:02,737
Uh...

1114
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,660
Go for a little walk.

1115
01:00:05,715 --> 01:00:08,695
Your teacher and I have to talk.

1116
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:18,435
Uh...

1117
01:00:18,436 --> 01:00:21,056
I know what this is about.

1118
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:29,157
I suppose you saw
the bruises on Zach's legs?

1119
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:34,399
My husband has started
counseling about this.

1120
01:00:34,493 --> 01:00:37,273
He's been going
for three weeks now.

1121
01:00:37,371 --> 01:00:40,111
Please don't bring
the school system into it.

1122
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:42,147
It will make matters worse.

1123
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:43,629
He's beating you, too?

1124
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,780
If he wasn't going
to counseling...

1125
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,780
I could see the point
of saying something...

1126
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:54,225
but I'm sure there won't be
any more occurrences.

1127
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,886
You won't say anything, will you?

1128
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:00,341
Please?

1129
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:05,715
If he does it again,
I press charges.

1130
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:18,669
Zach.

1131
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:38,724
You got the stuff?

1132
01:01:40,267 --> 01:01:41,887
Thanks, man.

1133
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:52,799
Here, lady.
I gave her your stuff.

1134
01:01:52,904 --> 01:01:55,364
Where's the rest of my money?

1135
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,800
Who are you, old lady?

1136
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:00,768
Your fairy godmother.

1137
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,041
Come in.

1138
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:07,782
Hi. It took all day...

1139
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:10,776
but I found out Zach Sullivan
and his mother...

1140
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,660
aren't related to Crisp.
I just found out.

1141
01:02:13,758 --> 01:02:17,738
Oh. I got a bottle of wine
for your big date...

1142
01:02:17,887 --> 01:02:20,187
It's not a date, I know.

1143
01:02:20,223 --> 01:02:21,763
But Joyce shouldn't think that.

1144
01:02:21,808 --> 01:02:24,548
Thanks. I don't think
it's a good idea.

1145
01:02:24,644 --> 01:02:27,384
Quickest way to slip up
doing undercover work

1146
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,260
is doing things
you normally wouldn't do.

1147
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:31,818
Wait a minute.

1148
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:34,239
You mean you wouldn't take wine

1149
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,260
to a woman
who's invited you for dinner?

1150
01:02:37,365 --> 01:02:38,825
Of course you would.

1151
01:02:38,866 --> 01:02:41,846
And flowers as well.
Here you go.

1152
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:44,459
She'll love them.

1153
01:03:00,262 --> 01:03:02,122
Well, here we are.

1154
01:03:02,181 --> 01:03:04,601
Wow. This is
quite a place.

1155
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,423
They must be paying you

1156
01:03:06,477 --> 01:03:09,297
a lot more than they're paying me.

1157
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:11,296
I wish it was my house.

1158
01:03:11,357 --> 01:03:14,097
It belongs to a friend of mine.

1159
01:03:14,193 --> 01:03:17,093
After the divorce,
he said we could stay here

1160
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:20,936
in exchange
for keeping the place up.

1161
01:03:21,074 --> 01:03:22,774
You must have nice friends.

1162
01:03:22,826 --> 01:03:24,118
Yes, I do.

1163
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,899
Dinner won't be ready
for a few minutes.

1164
01:03:26,955 --> 01:03:28,775
Can you start a fire?

1165
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,650
It shouldn't be a problem.

1166
01:03:30,709 --> 01:03:33,729
I'll show you where the wood is.

1167
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,380
Come on. Come on!

1168
01:03:38,675 --> 01:03:39,895
Right here.

1169
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:47,573
In here.

1170
01:03:48,685 --> 01:03:51,265
This is my secret hiding spot.

1171
01:03:51,354 --> 01:03:52,814
Wow.

1172
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:54,316
This is amazing.

1173
01:03:54,357 --> 01:03:55,817
I made it myself.

1174
01:03:55,859 --> 01:03:56,839
What's this?

1175
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,320
Don't touch that!

1176
01:03:58,361 --> 01:03:59,821
It's a laser...

1177
01:03:59,863 --> 01:04:02,763
and it'll burn a hole
right through you.

1178
01:04:02,866 --> 01:04:04,166
Okay. I'll be careful.

1179
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,500
Oh, don't shoot.

1180
01:04:05,535 --> 01:04:07,475
- Boom! Boom!
- Don't shoot.

1181
01:04:07,537 --> 01:04:11,077
I put up these lasers
to protect us.

1182
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:15,817
To protect you from what?

1183
01:04:15,879 --> 01:04:17,539
The bad people.

1184
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:20,769
Do you want to see something else?

1185
01:04:22,844 --> 01:04:24,184
Come on.

1186
01:04:25,054 --> 01:04:26,274
What?

1187
01:04:26,306 --> 01:04:28,006
See that?

1188
01:04:29,058 --> 01:04:30,758
You mean the tower?

1189
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:34,670
I'm going to plant one
of my lasers on that antenna.

1190
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:37,754
But I'll have to do it at night.

1191
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:41,279
Otherwise the bad people
will know where it is.

1192
01:04:43,865 --> 01:04:47,285
Last one to the table
is a rotten banana!

1193
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,350
Have you guys had fun?

1194
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,950
Yeah. Be right out!

1195
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:49,569
What you doing in there?

1196
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:50,778
I'm lost.

1197
01:05:50,806 --> 01:05:52,746
Where is the dining room?

1198
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:55,468
This house is huge.

1199
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:00,140
- Follow me, silly.
- Whew.

1200
01:06:00,315 --> 01:06:03,255
These are beautiful pictures
of you and Dominic.

1201
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,420
Thank you.

1202
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:09,061
When I was putting
Dominic to bed...

1203
01:06:09,157 --> 01:06:11,737
he mentioned you had a son, too.

1204
01:06:11,826 --> 01:06:13,606
That's right.
But I'm divorced.

1205
01:06:13,661 --> 01:06:17,721
I'm lucky. My ex got remarried
to a very nice man.

1206
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:20,294
He's really good to my son.

1207
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:22,036
I see him a lot.

1208
01:06:22,086 --> 01:06:23,986
What about your ex-husband?

1209
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:26,467
Does he see Dominic a lot?

1210
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,449
Uh, no. After the divorce,
he moved back to France.

1211
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:34,268
What about child support
and alimony?

1212
01:06:34,307 --> 01:06:36,687
Does he take care of you?

1213
01:06:38,144 --> 01:06:40,644
I'm sorry about being so personal.

1214
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:46,977
I was so glad to see him go

1215
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,449
I didn't worry about that part.

1216
01:06:49,488 --> 01:06:51,308
Dominic doesn't even remember him.

1217
01:06:51,324 --> 01:06:53,144
I prefer it that way.

1218
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:55,179
Are you sure?

1219
01:06:56,537 --> 01:06:57,597
Yeah.

1220
01:06:58,873 --> 01:07:00,213
Why?

1221
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,669
Well, Dominic was talking to me

1222
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:05,652
about having to move around a lot

1223
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,495
to keep the bad people away.

1224
01:07:09,842 --> 01:07:11,102
Bad people?

1225
01:07:11,135 --> 01:07:12,875
Something about having to leave

1226
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,188
in the middle of the night

1227
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,204
and leave his toys behind.

1228
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:21,246
Oh, God.

1229
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:24,172
I thought he'd
forgotten about that.

1230
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:29,215
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

1231
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:30,819
It's not your fault.

1232
01:07:30,863 --> 01:07:34,763
The truth is, my ex-husband
is a walking nightmare.

1233
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:38,287
He didn't leave us, we left him.

1234
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,830
He found out where we were

1235
01:07:40,872 --> 01:07:42,852
and tried to kidnap Dominic.

1236
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:45,814
He doesn't know where we are now...

1237
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:48,979
and I'd like to keep it that way.

1238
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:51,718
Of course.

1239
01:07:51,758 --> 01:07:55,658
I'm glad he's in France
and doesn't live nearby.

1240
01:08:01,434 --> 01:08:03,414
He doesn't live in France.

1241
01:08:06,439 --> 01:08:09,579
I told Dominic
that he lived in France.

1242
01:08:11,361 --> 01:08:15,821
I didn't know who my ex-husband
was when I married him.

1243
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:20,650
I was young and stupid,
and I made a mistake.

1244
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:25,897
I don't want Dominic
to pay for it.

1245
01:08:31,214 --> 01:08:34,234
Look, nobody around here
knows anything about this.

1246
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:37,842
I can't even believe I told you.

1247
01:08:41,265 --> 01:08:44,525
You have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

1248
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:49,255
You can trust me.

1249
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:55,279
That's very good. Perfect.

1250
01:08:55,321 --> 01:08:57,341
Okay. Let's try it again.

1251
01:08:57,406 --> 01:08:59,986
Mary, you first.

1252
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:04,096
Fourscores and seven years ago.

1253
01:09:04,246 --> 01:09:07,586
Fourscores and seven years ago.

1254
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,208
Our forefathers brought...

1255
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,470
Four fathers?

1256
01:09:12,505 --> 01:09:15,725
Mr. Kimble, did Lincoln
have four fathers?

1257
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:17,379
Uh...

1258
01:09:17,426 --> 01:09:18,686
I had three fathers...

1259
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,619
One named Walt, two named Ralph.

1260
01:09:24,183 --> 01:09:25,963
Did Lincoln have four mothers?

1261
01:09:25,976 --> 01:09:28,916
As a matter of fact,
he had two mothers.

1262
01:09:28,979 --> 01:09:30,959
Unfortunately, the first one died.

1263
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:32,403
I knew it.

1264
01:09:36,695 --> 01:09:37,835
Um... Okay.

1265
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:39,643
Let's take a break.
Come on.

1266
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:44,731
I want you to walk around
in a circle. Go.

1267
01:09:45,704 --> 01:09:47,084
Start. Come on.

1268
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:52,775
Well, Joyce's story
about the house checked out.

1269
01:09:52,878 --> 01:09:55,778
It belongs to a guy
who only uses it

1270
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:57,341
during the ski season.

1271
01:09:57,382 --> 01:10:00,122
She's got under $1,000
in the bank...

1272
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:04,718
no stocks, no bonds, no other assets
under the name Joyce Paulmarie.

1273
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:08,590
Her teacher's salary is less
than mine, which is pathetic.

1274
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:12,667
Keep looking. Check for offshore
accounts under Dominic's name...

1275
01:10:12,814 --> 01:10:15,714
She doesn't live like someone
with millions of dollars.

1276
01:10:15,817 --> 01:10:18,037
She doesn't even seem the type.

1277
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,331
Kimble, this might not be her.

1278
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:21,703
It's got to be her.

1279
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:24,160
Why? Because she
doesn't want to have

1280
01:10:24,242 --> 01:10:26,662
anything to do
with her ex-husband?

1281
01:10:26,703 --> 01:10:28,083
I know it's her.

1282
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:29,541
Know what I think?

1283
01:10:29,581 --> 01:10:32,001
You want it to be her.

1284
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:35,063
You really like her,
and it's scaring you.

1285
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:37,790
Excuse me!

1286
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:38,939
Surprise!

1287
01:10:38,965 --> 01:10:40,305
Ladies!

1288
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:42,681
Ladies, surprise.

1289
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,260
Obviously, I'm not
into baking cakes...

1290
01:10:45,346 --> 01:10:47,766
so I brought these little things

1291
01:10:47,849 --> 01:10:50,589
to donate for the raffle prizes.

1292
01:10:50,685 --> 01:10:53,145
Who the hell is that?

1293
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:56,169
She's the one
I was telling you about.

1294
01:10:56,274 --> 01:10:59,734
Her husband ran away
with another guy.

1295
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,880
It's been terrible for her.

1296
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:09,522
You're not getting
mellow on me, are you?

1297
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,600
3, 4.

1298
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:12,081
1, 2, 3...

1299
01:11:12,123 --> 01:11:13,103
Hi.

1300
01:11:13,124 --> 01:11:15,544
Come on. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1301
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:17,326
Come on. Go, go.

1302
01:11:17,378 --> 01:11:21,638
I see they stuck you with the
Gettysburg Address this year.

1303
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:23,457
They sure did.

1304
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:25,968
Company, halt!

1305
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:32,992
Um...

1306
01:11:33,977 --> 01:11:35,637
About last night...

1307
01:11:35,688 --> 01:11:38,948
I've been thinking
about it, and...

1308
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:43,097
I'm glad I told you
all those things.

1309
01:11:43,195 --> 01:11:44,615
So am I.

1310
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,770
Um... I-I better
get going.

1311
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:52,448
Yeah. I have
to get going, too.

1312
01:11:55,832 --> 01:11:57,492
Is everything okay?

1313
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:58,642
Yeah.

1314
01:12:00,003 --> 01:12:02,343
See you tomorrow at the fair.

1315
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,682
I'm looking forward to it.

1316
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,620
What are you looking at?

1317
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,700
Ha ha ha!

1318
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:12,783
Shh!

1319
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:16,042
March! 1, 2, 3, 4.

1320
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:20,722
I was just talking
to the teacher, that's all.

1321
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:23,439
Yeah. Don't laugh.

1322
01:12:24,736 --> 01:12:27,596
Okay. I'm proud of you.
Keep going.

1323
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:30,595
I'm sorry Zach's late.
The car wouldn't start.

1324
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,640
You be a good boy.

1325
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,200
I love you.

1326
01:12:35,705 --> 01:12:36,885
Hi, champ.

1327
01:12:36,915 --> 01:12:38,335
Oh!

1328
01:12:38,374 --> 01:12:39,754
What's the matter?

1329
01:12:43,796 --> 01:12:44,856
Oh, no.

1330
01:12:44,881 --> 01:12:46,741
I fell down again.

1331
01:12:50,345 --> 01:12:51,885
Hey, wait a minute.

1332
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:54,687
Uh...

1333
01:12:54,724 --> 01:12:57,944
I forgot to close the door
to the basement...

1334
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,560
and Zach had a bad fall.

1335
01:13:00,646 --> 01:13:03,786
You all say the same thing,
"He fell down."

1336
01:13:03,858 --> 01:13:06,638
Don't you have
anything better to say?

1337
01:13:06,694 --> 01:13:09,474
I don't have to
justify myself to you!

1338
01:13:09,572 --> 01:13:12,632
You have no right
talking to me like that.

1339
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:15,910
How are you doing?

1340
01:13:15,953 --> 01:13:19,875
You must be the Mr. Kimble
we hear so much about.

1341
01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:21,377
You hit the kid, I hit you.

1342
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:22,797
You bastard!

1343
01:13:33,345 --> 01:13:34,805
You're not worth it.

1344
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:37,707
I'm pressing charges against you.

1345
01:13:39,393 --> 01:13:41,373
Excuse me, everybody.

1346
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:49,847
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have hit the man...

1347
01:13:49,945 --> 01:13:52,245
especially in front
of the children.

1348
01:13:52,322 --> 01:13:53,942
It was a mistake.

1349
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,290
I checked you out.

1350
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:03,710
There is no record of you
ever having taught

1351
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:05,294
at any public school...

1352
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:07,275
in California or anywhere else.

1353
01:14:07,337 --> 01:14:08,877
Mr. Kimble...

1354
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:13,302
you have no teaching experience
whatsoever, do you?

1355
01:14:14,469 --> 01:14:16,249
Someone finally noticed.

1356
01:14:16,263 --> 01:14:19,043
I thought
the introduction of a ferret

1357
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,440
was a horrible idea...

1358
01:14:20,475 --> 01:14:22,615
but the children
seemed to like it.

1359
01:14:22,686 --> 01:14:26,186
I thought the use of your police
whistle was outrageous...

1360
01:14:26,314 --> 01:14:28,014
That's all I could think of.

1361
01:14:28,066 --> 01:14:30,566
Please allow me to finish.

1362
01:14:30,652 --> 01:14:34,232
- Sorry.
- But it worked.

1363
01:14:34,364 --> 01:14:40,424
I have no idea what kind
of police officer you are...

1364
01:14:40,662 --> 01:14:45,682
but you're a very good teacher.

1365
01:14:49,712 --> 01:14:51,172
Thank you.

1366
01:14:52,882 --> 01:14:57,182
Now, will you tell me something?
Don't lie.

1367
01:14:57,303 --> 01:15:02,563
What did it feel like
to hit that son of a bitch?

1368
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,780
It felt great.

1369
01:15:11,192 --> 01:15:12,412
Yeah.

1370
01:15:14,195 --> 01:15:17,095
Well, tomorrow morning.

1371
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:19,138
Bright and early.

1372
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,658
Thank you.

1373
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:21,679
Yeah.

1374
01:15:32,296 --> 01:15:33,796
Yeah, that's her.

1375
01:15:33,839 --> 01:15:36,619
And there goes our goddamn case.

1376
01:15:36,675 --> 01:15:39,215
Tell O'Hara and Kimble
their witness is dead...

1377
01:15:39,303 --> 01:15:41,043
so Crisp is going to walk.

1378
01:15:41,096 --> 01:15:42,916
We want them back here.

1379
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:45,473
We've got lots
of other cases to clear.

1380
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:48,299
O'Hara says they think
they've located the wife.

1381
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:49,613
And the money?

1382
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:51,026
They're looking into it.

1383
01:15:51,064 --> 01:15:52,524
Have them tell the wife

1384
01:15:52,566 --> 01:15:56,186
we're letting Crisp go,
and he knows where she is.

1385
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,220
If she wants police protection,
she'll produce the money.

1386
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:01,743
Sorry it took so long, Cullen.

1387
01:16:01,825 --> 01:16:03,365
Hey, you're looking great.

1388
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:11,293
I love you, Mother.

1389
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:14,154
We're going to be
a family again, son.

1390
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:43,759
Go!

1391
01:17:10,977 --> 01:17:14,197
Fourscore and seven years ago

1392
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:17,973
Fourscore and seven years ago

1393
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:22,009
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent

1394
01:17:22,154 --> 01:17:25,854
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent

1395
01:17:25,991 --> 01:17:27,931
a new nation

1396
01:17:27,993 --> 01:17:29,773
a new nation

1397
01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:32,129
conceived in liberty

1398
01:17:32,206 --> 01:17:34,586
conceived in liberty

1399
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:37,405
and dedicated to the proposition

1400
01:17:37,503 --> 01:17:40,283
and dedicated to the proposition

1401
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:43,481
that all men are created equal

1402
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:46,812
that all men are created equal

1403
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:48,869
and that government

1404
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,951
and that government

1405
01:17:51,016 --> 01:17:52,308
of the people

1406
01:17:52,309 --> 01:17:53,369
by the people

1407
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:54,974
and for the people

1408
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,240
shall not perish from this earth.

1409
01:18:00,067 --> 01:18:02,047
Thank you very much.

1410
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:20,457
Oh!

1411
01:18:20,504 --> 01:18:25,044
I'd like to introduce you
to our kindergarten teacher.

1412
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:27,877
He came to us
as a substitute teacher...

1413
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,869
and he's proven to be
a wonderful asset.

1414
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:34,752
Let's welcome him
into our community

1415
01:18:34,851 --> 01:18:36,831
and hope that he considers

1416
01:18:36,853 --> 01:18:38,833
staying on a permanent basis.

1417
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:41,155
Ladies and gentlemen...

1418
01:18:41,232 --> 01:18:43,972
Mr. John Kimble.

1419
01:19:19,645 --> 01:19:21,305
Nice town.

1420
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:22,535
Hmm.

1421
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:26,907
Ahh! Smell that fresh air.

1422
01:19:26,986 --> 01:19:29,966
We should think about
buying something up here...

1423
01:19:30,072 --> 01:19:33,972
like some log cabin
in the woods near a lake.

1424
01:19:34,076 --> 01:19:37,016
Kids love
that outdoor kind of stuff.

1425
01:19:37,121 --> 01:19:38,901
I'll be in the pharmacy.

1426
01:19:38,956 --> 01:19:41,496
Try not to step in anything.

1427
01:19:56,348 --> 01:19:57,688
I'd like to help you.

1428
01:19:57,725 --> 01:20:00,425
But we're pretty much
out of the race cars...

1429
01:20:00,519 --> 01:20:01,499
unless...

1430
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,340
This is the last one.

1431
01:20:03,397 --> 01:20:05,337
It's still in great shape.

1432
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:08,299
If you don't mind waiting,
I'll wrap it up.

1433
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:09,822
I'll knock 10% off...

1434
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:11,802
I have a better idea.

1435
01:20:11,863 --> 01:20:14,083
I'll pay you twice
what he's charging.

1436
01:20:15,325 --> 01:20:18,305
I promised my boy I'd get him one.

1437
01:20:18,412 --> 01:20:19,832
I'd love to help you...

1438
01:20:19,871 --> 01:20:22,571
but my kid's been bugging me
since Christmas.

1439
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:25,406
I'll pay you four times
what it's worth.

1440
01:20:25,502 --> 01:20:27,922
Get your kid
something even better.

1441
01:20:27,963 --> 01:20:30,263
Sorry.
Can you gift-wrap it?

1442
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,280
Hanna, could you
wrap that, please?

1443
01:20:32,342 --> 01:20:33,882
No harm in trying.

1444
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,780
Tourists.

1445
01:20:43,186 --> 01:20:44,966
Great, Dominic.
You're doing well.

1446
01:20:45,021 --> 01:20:47,761
I'll wait over here for you, okay?

1447
01:20:47,857 --> 01:20:48,917
Okay.

1448
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,820
Great day, huh?

1449
01:20:58,868 --> 01:21:00,808
We've run out of time.

1450
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:03,170
We've got to press Joyce now.

1451
01:21:03,248 --> 01:21:04,828
What do you mean?

1452
01:21:04,874 --> 01:21:07,294
- Cindy O.D.'d last night.
- Shit.

1453
01:21:07,377 --> 01:21:09,317
They released Crisp this morning.

1454
01:21:09,379 --> 01:21:11,319
He's probably on his way here.

1455
01:21:11,381 --> 01:21:14,281
Salazar said if Joyce
is Crisp's wife...

1456
01:21:14,384 --> 01:21:16,804
she's got to cooperate
about the money...

1457
01:21:16,886 --> 01:21:19,786
or she gets no police protection.

1458
01:21:19,889 --> 01:21:20,869
Bastard.

1459
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:24,150
Ursula, how are you?

1460
01:21:27,605 --> 01:21:28,745
What?

1461
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:34,719
I've got to tell you the truth.

1462
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,320
Her name's not Ursula.

1463
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:38,866
She's not my sister.

1464
01:21:38,908 --> 01:21:41,128
I beg your pardon?

1465
01:21:41,243 --> 01:21:43,903
We're not who you think we are.

1466
01:21:43,996 --> 01:21:45,976
What is this?

1467
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:49,749
We're police officers.

1468
01:21:52,338 --> 01:21:54,118
We know who you are...

1469
01:21:54,173 --> 01:21:55,233
Rachel.

1470
01:21:55,257 --> 01:21:57,197
This is a joke, right?

1471
01:21:57,259 --> 01:21:59,199
No. This is no joke.

1472
01:21:59,261 --> 01:22:00,721
You took $3 million.

1473
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:01,721
I think...

1474
01:22:01,722 --> 01:22:03,542
Crisp knows where you are.

1475
01:22:03,557 --> 01:22:05,857
He could be here any minute.

1476
01:22:05,934 --> 01:22:07,194
Where's Dominic?

1477
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:09,367
You'll get immunity
for your testimony...

1478
01:22:09,438 --> 01:22:11,698
but we need you to help us.

1479
01:22:11,732 --> 01:22:12,732
Where's Dominic?

1480
01:22:12,733 --> 01:22:14,273
On a pony.

1481
01:22:14,318 --> 01:22:17,538
We'll offer protection
if you tell us about the money.

1482
01:22:17,654 --> 01:22:20,194
There's no money,
you son of a bitch.

1483
01:22:20,282 --> 01:22:21,462
There never was!

1484
01:22:22,284 --> 01:22:24,064
No, it's not fair!

1485
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:25,619
I'm not finished yet!

1486
01:22:25,662 --> 01:22:27,562
The bad people have found us.

1487
01:22:27,622 --> 01:22:30,362
What do you mean, "no money"?

1488
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:32,397
Why are you mad at Mr. Kimble?

1489
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:33,919
Because he's a jerk.

1490
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,020
Leave me alone!

1491
01:22:39,134 --> 01:22:40,714
Joyce, wait!

1492
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,820
Wait!

1493
01:22:41,845 --> 01:22:43,745
If you didn't take the money...

1494
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:45,265
why is he after you?

1495
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:48,245
He doesn't want me.
He wants Dominic.

1496
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:56,799
She's going to run again.

1497
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,040
Yeah.

1498
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:01,649
Unless we do something about it.

1499
01:23:01,781 --> 01:23:03,161
Yeah.

1500
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,659
Hey, snap out of it!

1501
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,000
Daryl. Daryl.

1502
01:23:14,043 --> 01:23:17,623
I'm sorry. I wanted to give you
a second chance.

1503
01:23:17,755 --> 01:23:18,935
200, cash.

1504
01:23:18,965 --> 01:23:20,545
What is wrong with you?

1505
01:23:20,591 --> 01:23:24,531
I'm still not getting
through to you, am I, Daryl?

1506
01:23:32,603 --> 01:23:35,463
Mother, got this great surprise
for Junior.

1507
01:23:35,564 --> 01:23:37,464
That'll be 57.90.

1508
01:23:37,525 --> 01:23:39,465
57.90.

1509
01:23:39,527 --> 01:23:44,107
Children's aspirin,
children's decongestant...

1510
01:23:44,281 --> 01:23:46,181
antihistamine.

1511
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:49,175
A thermometer?

1512
01:23:49,203 --> 01:23:52,583
A lot of flu going around, right?

1513
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:54,005
It is the season.

1514
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:55,541
The boy's not sick.

1515
01:23:55,584 --> 01:23:57,484
Doesn't hurt to take precautions.

1516
01:23:57,544 --> 01:24:01,284
Mother, you are going
to make him sick.

1517
01:24:01,423 --> 01:24:05,243
You stuffed all this crap into me,
and nothing was wrong.

1518
01:24:05,344 --> 01:24:09,244
That's why there was
nothing wrong with you.

1519
01:24:10,974 --> 01:24:14,794
Now, how can you argue with that?

1520
01:24:26,823 --> 01:24:27,883
Joyce!

1521
01:24:34,372 --> 01:24:36,352
Joyce! Dominic!

1522
01:24:55,018 --> 01:24:56,438
You bastard!
Where's Dominic?

1523
01:24:56,478 --> 01:24:58,418
I don't know.
What happened?

1524
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,860
You led him here.
If he has Dominic, I'll kill you.

1525
01:25:01,983 --> 01:25:03,483
Let go of me!

1526
01:25:03,526 --> 01:25:05,426
We'll find him. Stop it.

1527
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:07,547
We'll find him.

1528
01:25:07,614 --> 01:25:09,714
We'll find him.

1529
01:25:11,117 --> 01:25:12,297
Dominic!

1530
01:25:12,327 --> 01:25:14,547
Did he say anything
before he left?

1531
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:17,241
He said something
about getting his lasers.

1532
01:25:17,332 --> 01:25:21,352
Lasers? I think
I know where he is.

1533
01:25:53,993 --> 01:25:55,773
Aah! Help!

1534
01:25:56,954 --> 01:25:58,654
Help! Help!

1535
01:25:58,706 --> 01:26:00,606
Somebody!

1536
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:02,326
Help!

1537
01:26:02,376 --> 01:26:03,356
Hold on!

1538
01:26:03,377 --> 01:26:05,197
I'll get him down.

1539
01:26:05,254 --> 01:26:06,274
Help!

1540
01:26:06,297 --> 01:26:08,197
Hold on. I'm right here.

1541
01:26:08,257 --> 01:26:09,517
Good boy.

1542
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:11,570
All right. Just hold on.

1543
01:26:11,635 --> 01:26:14,415
Okay. Just hold on.

1544
01:26:14,513 --> 01:26:16,453
Oh, good. Okay.

1545
01:26:16,515 --> 01:26:20,495
I was going to put the lasers
in the antenna.

1546
01:26:20,644 --> 01:26:23,464
I know. Don't worry
about anything now.

1547
01:26:23,564 --> 01:26:26,104
I got you.
Just hold on tight now.

1548
01:26:26,191 --> 01:26:27,651
Hold on tight, okay?

1549
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:28,711
Good.

1550
01:26:35,033 --> 01:26:36,493
If I lost Dominic...

1551
01:26:36,535 --> 01:26:39,435
I don't think
I could go on living.

1552
01:26:39,538 --> 01:26:42,038
You're not going to lose him.

1553
01:26:42,124 --> 01:26:44,464
That's right. I'm not.

1554
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:48,650
Cullen said I stole his money

1555
01:26:48,672 --> 01:26:52,092
so these creeps would
follow us for a reward.

1556
01:26:52,175 --> 01:26:54,315
You don't know what he's like.

1557
01:26:54,386 --> 01:26:55,846
Oh, yes, I do.

1558
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:57,347
I know him well.

1559
01:26:57,389 --> 01:27:00,289
That's why I don't
want him to get you two.

1560
01:27:00,392 --> 01:27:02,332
Can't trust you or anybody.

1561
01:27:02,394 --> 01:27:03,854
You can trust me.

1562
01:27:03,895 --> 01:27:05,715
That's what you said before.

1563
01:27:07,357 --> 01:27:10,297
And you turned out to be a cop.

1564
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:11,540
I...

1565
01:27:11,569 --> 01:27:13,989
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1566
01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:17,612
I wish I was
a kindergarten teacher...

1567
01:27:17,742 --> 01:27:19,522
but I'm not.

1568
01:27:19,577 --> 01:27:21,037
I'm a cop.

1569
01:27:21,037 --> 01:27:23,977
That's all I know how to be.

1570
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:26,982
I have to get out of here.

1571
01:27:27,043 --> 01:27:29,023
You have a son.

1572
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:31,867
If you were me,
you'd do the same thing.

1573
01:27:35,343 --> 01:27:39,163
I have a son I've hardly seen
in seven years.

1574
01:27:39,305 --> 01:27:41,525
I don't mean anything to him.

1575
01:27:43,434 --> 01:27:45,534
My ex-wife got remarried.

1576
01:27:45,603 --> 01:27:49,463
She doesn't want me
to be part of his life.

1577
01:27:53,152 --> 01:27:55,212
I lost my family.

1578
01:27:56,614 --> 01:27:59,834
I should never have let it happen.

1579
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:02,850
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1580
01:28:03,829 --> 01:28:06,369
I don't want to lose you.

1581
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,460
I don't want to lose Dominic.

1582
01:28:16,133 --> 01:28:20,153
I swear you'll never have
to run from him again.

1583
01:28:33,317 --> 01:28:35,257
Don't worry about anything, okay?

1584
01:28:35,319 --> 01:28:37,739
We're going to be
right across the hall.

1585
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:39,281
Everything's going to be fine.

1586
01:28:39,323 --> 01:28:41,743
We just want to be extra careful.

1587
01:28:41,825 --> 01:28:42,845
Thanks.

1588
01:28:42,868 --> 01:28:43,808
Don't worry.

1589
01:28:43,827 --> 01:28:46,727
Whoo!

1590
01:28:48,498 --> 01:28:51,038
All right, all right.
Settle down.

1591
01:28:55,505 --> 01:28:57,245
Good morning.

1592
01:28:57,299 --> 01:29:02,199
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

1593
01:29:02,387 --> 01:29:03,847
Sit down.

1594
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:06,828
It's very nice
to see you all again.

1595
01:29:06,933 --> 01:29:09,793
Meet my very good friend,
Phoebe O'Hara.

1596
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:13,074
Good morning, Phoebe.

1597
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:15,609
Miss O'Hara
is going to talk to you

1598
01:29:15,692 --> 01:29:17,152
about something very important.

1599
01:29:17,193 --> 01:29:21,533
So pay attention to what
she has to say, okay?

1600
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:23,956
Remember, no fear.

1601
01:29:24,033 --> 01:29:25,813
Thanks.

1602
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:28,934
Yeah?

1603
01:29:30,248 --> 01:29:33,468
Boys have a penis.
Girls have a vagina.

1604
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,220
Well, you taught them the basics.

1605
01:29:43,302 --> 01:29:45,082
That's important.

1606
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:46,799
Okay, now...

1607
01:29:46,847 --> 01:29:48,347
today we're going to talk

1608
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:50,811
about something else
that's really important.

1609
01:29:50,851 --> 01:29:53,871
Today we're going
to talk about strangers.

1610
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:57,361
If a stranger knocks
on your door...

1611
01:29:57,525 --> 01:29:59,545
never answer the door.

1612
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:02,070
Because we never talk
to strangers.

1613
01:30:02,154 --> 01:30:03,574
Let's say that together.

1614
01:30:03,614 --> 01:30:07,234
We never talk to strangers.

1615
01:30:07,326 --> 01:30:08,326
Right.

1616
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:10,827
Can we talk to kids?

1617
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:13,731
Yeah, it's okay.
You can talk to kids.

1618
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:15,292
What about dogs?

1619
01:30:15,334 --> 01:30:16,709
Huh?

1620
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:18,650
Can we talk to dogs?

1621
01:30:18,671 --> 01:30:21,091
Yeah, you can talk to dogs.

1622
01:30:21,173 --> 01:30:23,113
But what you can't do...

1623
01:30:23,175 --> 01:30:26,555
what you must never ever do is...

1624
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:30,978
never talk to strangers.

1625
01:30:31,141 --> 01:30:33,761
On the kindergarten level...

1626
01:30:33,852 --> 01:30:37,232
we try to emphasize the three C's:

1627
01:30:37,356 --> 01:30:41,136
Caring, courtesy and courage.

1628
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:44,695
Courage.

1629
01:30:44,696 --> 01:30:46,236
That's my philosophy, too.

1630
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:49,299
Are you a single parent,
Mr. Green?

1631
01:30:49,409 --> 01:30:51,909
No, my wife had to stay behind

1632
01:30:51,995 --> 01:30:54,415
to complete the sale of our home.

1633
01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:58,398
I'm checking the schools
before we buy a home here.

1634
01:30:58,543 --> 01:31:01,603
Most kindergarten children
can't read yet.

1635
01:31:01,713 --> 01:31:03,173
My son can.

1636
01:31:03,214 --> 01:31:05,634
He reads at 6?
That's good.

1637
01:31:05,717 --> 01:31:08,137
And writes.
I taught him myself.

1638
01:31:08,219 --> 01:31:10,159
He sounds like a special child.

1639
01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:12,641
He is. He's a great athlete.

1640
01:31:12,724 --> 01:31:15,624
Here's what you've waited for.
The kindergarten.

1641
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:18,067
Have a look.

1642
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:19,924
Oh, Dominic, Dominic...

1643
01:31:19,939 --> 01:31:22,439
Dominic is king of the mountain!

1644
01:31:22,525 --> 01:31:24,945
Way to go, Dominic.

1645
01:31:25,028 --> 01:31:26,568
Here's your crown.

1646
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:27,613
Congratulations, Dominic.

1647
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:29,634
The king of Mount Kimble!

1648
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:30,999
Dominic.

1649
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:39,147
He looks odd, but he's
a wonderful teacher.

1650
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,230
Yes, I'm sure he is.

1651
01:31:48,217 --> 01:31:50,157
Did you see Cullen Jr.?

1652
01:31:50,219 --> 01:31:51,519
Yeah, yeah.

1653
01:31:51,554 --> 01:31:52,971
She calls him Dominic.

1654
01:31:52,972 --> 01:31:55,432
She'd always wanted
to name him Dominic.

1655
01:31:55,474 --> 01:31:57,294
What a dumb name.

1656
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:00,810
Put that cigar out.
It's unhealthy for the kid.

1657
01:32:54,157 --> 01:32:57,497
Then you make your aeroplane
go up into the clouds.

1658
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:03,252
Check it out.

1659
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:04,271
Right.

1660
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:05,832
Okay, stay calm.

1661
01:33:05,877 --> 01:33:08,897
Okay, it's probably a fire drill.

1662
01:33:09,005 --> 01:33:10,172
Oh, man.

1663
01:33:10,173 --> 01:33:12,513
Kimble, the hallway's
full of smoke.

1664
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:15,490
Okay, this is a fire drill.
Come on.

1665
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:17,573
This is the real thing.

1666
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:19,339
Just the way we practiced.

1667
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:21,331
Go out there.

1668
01:33:21,351 --> 01:33:24,371
Fast. Just the way
we practiced it.

1669
01:33:28,691 --> 01:33:30,271
Come on.

1670
01:33:35,907 --> 01:33:37,047
Come on.

1671
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:39,655
It's only water.
Don't be scared.

1672
01:33:41,871 --> 01:33:44,811
Stay close to the wall.
Let's go.

1673
01:33:44,874 --> 01:33:47,014
Come on. Come on.

1674
01:33:47,043 --> 01:33:49,503
Dominic, stay close to me, okay?

1675
01:33:49,545 --> 01:33:51,405
Stay close to me.

1676
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:56,602
Stay behind me.

1677
01:33:56,677 --> 01:33:57,977
Don't get separated.

1678
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:10,410
Aah!

1679
01:34:13,068 --> 01:34:14,528
Are you all right?

1680
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:16,390
Come on. Let's go.

1681
01:34:16,405 --> 01:34:17,905
Dominic, wait!

1682
01:34:20,284 --> 01:34:21,409
Dominic!

1683
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:22,550
Dominic!

1684
01:34:24,288 --> 01:34:26,588
Help! Somebody help me!

1685
01:34:26,624 --> 01:34:27,749
Help!

1686
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,690
Stranger!

1687
01:34:29,752 --> 01:34:30,892
Stranger!

1688
01:34:30,919 --> 01:34:32,499
Stranger!
Stranger!

1689
01:34:32,546 --> 01:34:33,526
Stranger!

1690
01:34:33,547 --> 01:34:34,607
Stranger!

1691
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:36,811
Dominic!
Where's Dominic?

1692
01:34:36,884 --> 01:34:38,384
Dominic!

1693
01:34:55,485 --> 01:34:57,345
Aah!

1694
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:06,150
Okay, stay together.
Stay together.

1695
01:35:06,246 --> 01:35:10,066
Stay together.
Hold onto your partner.

1696
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:11,706
Okay, don't lag behind.

1697
01:35:11,751 --> 01:35:13,211
Hold onto my hand.

1698
01:35:13,253 --> 01:35:14,461
Stay together.

1699
01:35:14,462 --> 01:35:15,922
Where's Dominic?

1700
01:35:15,964 --> 01:35:18,384
He's inside.
Kimble's looking for him.

1701
01:35:18,466 --> 01:35:19,446
Joyce!

1702
01:35:19,467 --> 01:35:20,767
Joyce!

1703
01:35:49,997 --> 01:35:51,137
Help!

1704
01:35:51,165 --> 01:35:52,625
It's okay. It's okay.

1705
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:54,607
I'm not going to hurt you.

1706
01:35:54,669 --> 01:35:56,609
I'm not going to hurt you.

1707
01:35:56,671 --> 01:35:57,691
It's okay.

1708
01:35:57,713 --> 01:35:59,653
I'm a fireman.

1709
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:01,334
I help people.

1710
01:36:05,346 --> 01:36:07,726
Well, where's your hat?

1711
01:36:08,849 --> 01:36:10,109
My hat?

1712
01:36:10,142 --> 01:36:12,562
I love this.

1713
01:36:12,645 --> 01:36:15,545
I can't fool my own boy.

1714
01:36:15,648 --> 01:36:17,548
He's just 6 years old.

1715
01:36:17,566 --> 01:36:18,666
You're right.

1716
01:36:18,692 --> 01:36:21,512
I'm no jerk fireman.

1717
01:36:23,656 --> 01:36:26,116
I'm going to tell you
something, Dominic.

1718
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,100
It's going to be hard
for you to understand...

1719
01:36:29,203 --> 01:36:32,223
but you got to believe me.

1720
01:36:37,378 --> 01:36:40,158
I'm your father, Dominic.

1721
01:36:40,214 --> 01:36:42,154
Your father.

1722
01:36:44,176 --> 01:36:46,116
Don't you recognize me?

1723
01:36:47,221 --> 01:36:48,361
No.

1724
01:36:48,388 --> 01:36:50,288
Sure you do.
It's me.

1725
01:36:50,349 --> 01:36:53,289
Don't you remember
Twinkle, twinkle, little star?

1726
01:36:53,393 --> 01:36:56,413
We have the same kind of hands.

1727
01:36:56,521 --> 01:36:58,221
Don't you remember?

1728
01:36:58,231 --> 01:37:01,651
You're not my father.
My father lives in France.

1729
01:37:01,735 --> 01:37:03,675
Your mother told you that...

1730
01:37:03,737 --> 01:37:05,197
but that's not true!

1731
01:37:05,238 --> 01:37:06,658
I'm your father!

1732
01:37:06,698 --> 01:37:09,078
I've been searching
for you for five years.

1733
01:37:09,117 --> 01:37:11,937
Help! Help!

1734
01:37:12,037 --> 01:37:13,497
Dominic, I'm your father.

1735
01:37:13,538 --> 01:37:15,998
You're going to have
to do what I say.

1736
01:37:16,082 --> 01:37:18,182
Do you understand?

1737
01:37:21,087 --> 01:37:22,827
Freeze!

1738
01:37:22,881 --> 01:37:24,901
Don't you know there's a fire?

1739
01:37:24,966 --> 01:37:26,986
We thought it was another drill.

1740
01:37:27,052 --> 01:37:28,469
Well, get out!

1741
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:29,570
Yes, sir.

1742
01:37:47,614 --> 01:37:50,514
Whoa, honey.
That's a fire in there.

1743
01:37:50,616 --> 01:37:54,316
I got a kid in there.
I'm a cop.

1744
01:37:54,495 --> 01:37:56,875
If I need a ticket fixed,
I'll call you.

1745
01:37:56,956 --> 01:37:58,696
In the meantime, stay out.

1746
01:37:58,749 --> 01:37:59,729
Go on.

1747
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,770
All right.

1748
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:38,889
Quiet, you hear me? Quiet.

1749
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:47,264
No!

1750
01:38:47,297 --> 01:38:48,277
Rachel!

1751
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:49,278
Let go!

1752
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:50,919
Just what I need.

1753
01:38:50,968 --> 01:38:52,428
Please, let him go.

1754
01:38:52,469 --> 01:38:53,929
Let him go!

1755
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:57,391
How the hell
do you get out of here?

1756
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:01,637
Please, please, don't do this!

1757
01:39:01,687 --> 01:39:02,987
You're scaring him!

1758
01:39:03,021 --> 01:39:05,761
Scared? Of course he's scared.

1759
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:08,277
You told him lies about me.

1760
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,180
My son doesn't know me
because of you.

1761
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:12,298
Listen!

1762
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:13,302
Just listen.

1763
01:39:13,323 --> 01:39:15,263
You stole him from me!

1764
01:39:15,325 --> 01:39:16,865
Please, give him back.

1765
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,650
Don't touch him!

1766
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,079
Aah!

1767
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,860
Dominic, I had to do it!

1768
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:24,853
I didn't want to do it.
She made me.

1769
01:39:24,918 --> 01:39:27,578
Everything's going
to be okay, Dominic.

1770
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:29,451
Dominic?

1771
01:39:29,506 --> 01:39:31,486
Come back.

1772
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,969
We're getting out of here.

1773
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:35,392
Dominic?

1774
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:39,454
Going to start a whole new family.

1775
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,354
Aah!

1776
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,413
Dominic!

1777
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:46,997
Gotcha!

1778
01:39:47,023 --> 01:39:49,483
I love you.
Do you understand?

1779
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,827
Tell me you understand that.

1780
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,883
Say it. Say it!

1781
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:56,846
I understand.

1782
01:39:56,908 --> 01:39:58,728
Daddy.

1783
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:02,079
Daddy.

1784
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,121
Hold it!

1785
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:06,342
Right there.
Drop it! Hurry!

1786
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:07,677
Don't. Don't.

1787
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,370
He's not your hostage.
He's your son.

1788
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:11,921
Drop it. On the floor.

1789
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:14,063
You'll do this to your own son?

1790
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,993
Drop it!
I'm losing it! Hurry!

1791
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,234
Relax. I'm putting it down.

1792
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,403
Hurry!

1793
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,806
Here it is.

1794
01:40:21,807 --> 01:40:23,307
Here it is.

1795
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:25,769
Just don't harm the boy, okay?

1796
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:28,991
Good. Good. That's smart.

1797
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,966
All right.

1798
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:33,963
Why don't you let the boy go now?

1799
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:35,529
The boy is mine!

1800
01:40:35,571 --> 01:40:37,031
He's my boy!

1801
01:40:37,072 --> 01:40:39,852
You get your own goddamn family!

1802
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:42,290
Aah!

1803
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:43,628
No!

1804
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:57,424
Are you okay?

1805
01:40:57,467 --> 01:40:58,887
I'm okay. Get Dominic.

1806
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,107
Okay.

1807
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:01,117
Dominic!

1808
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:02,518
Dominic!

1809
01:41:54,649 --> 01:41:57,269
Where's my grandson?

1810
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:00,189
I don't know.

1811
01:42:03,032 --> 01:42:05,252
Where's my grandson?

1812
01:42:05,326 --> 01:42:07,146
Go to hell.

1813
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:12,399
That's where you're going,
you son of a bitch!

1814
01:42:20,883 --> 01:42:23,623
You're not so tough
without your car...

1815
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:24,859
are you?

1816
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:40,345
Mr. Kimble,
are you all right?

1817
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,840
Oh, I hate this.

1818
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:33,178
Nah, he doesn't want to eat that.

1819
01:43:33,288 --> 01:43:34,748
He's a tough guy.

1820
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:37,209
Tough guys don't eat Jell-O.

1821
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:38,752
I'll come back later.

1822
01:43:38,793 --> 01:43:39,773
Hi.

1823
01:43:39,794 --> 01:43:41,254
Hi. How you feeling?

1824
01:43:41,296 --> 01:43:42,716
Much better.

1825
01:43:42,756 --> 01:43:44,216
How about you?

1826
01:43:44,257 --> 01:43:45,597
I'll live.

1827
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:47,773
Check out of here.
This stuff will kill you.

1828
01:43:47,802 --> 01:43:49,902
Just don't throw up on me.

1829
01:43:49,971 --> 01:43:52,431
I'm not going
to throw up on you...

1830
01:43:52,474 --> 01:43:55,014
but I am going to kiss you.

1831
01:43:56,811 --> 01:43:58,471
Phoebe.

1832
01:43:58,479 --> 01:43:59,939
Thanks.

1833
01:44:01,149 --> 01:44:03,089
Thanks, partner.

1834
01:44:04,152 --> 01:44:05,252
Sure.

1835
01:44:05,278 --> 01:44:06,695
How's everybody feeling today?

1836
01:44:06,696 --> 01:44:09,636
I brought goodies.
Did I do that?

1837
01:44:09,699 --> 01:44:11,319
Give me the flowers.

1838
01:44:11,367 --> 01:44:13,307
I got some goodies and...

1839
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:14,787
I got it caught.

1840
01:44:14,829 --> 01:44:17,369
And something I cooked myself.

1841
01:44:17,456 --> 01:44:21,516
I almost didn't recognize you
with all your clothes on.

1842
01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:23,169
You look good yourself.

1843
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:25,230
Aah!

1844
01:44:25,298 --> 01:44:26,798
Did I... I'm sorry.

1845
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:28,141
The wedding.

1846
01:44:28,175 --> 01:44:29,795
Yeah. Uh...

1847
01:44:29,844 --> 01:44:31,984
You're coming
to the wedding, right?

1848
01:44:32,013 --> 01:44:34,793
Is it safe?

1849
01:44:36,684 --> 01:44:39,704
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1850
01:44:40,896 --> 01:44:42,156
So...

1851
01:44:42,189 --> 01:44:45,249
where do we send the invitation?

1852
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:46,939
Hmm?

1853
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,040
They're all yours.

1854
01:45:34,908 --> 01:45:36,568
Hi, kids.

1855
01:45:36,618 --> 01:45:38,238
Mr. Kimble!

1856
01:45:38,245 --> 01:45:39,705
I'm back.

1857
01:45:39,746 --> 01:45:43,286
Yay!

1858
01:45:43,416 --> 01:45:45,996
Didn't join the union until...

1859
01:45:51,925 --> 01:45:53,705
Class, excuse me.

1860
01:46:20,036 --> 01:46:22,936
Uh-oh. They're going to do it.

1861
01:46:24,999 --> 01:46:27,059
Yay!
