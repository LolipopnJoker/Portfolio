It would be even more impressive
if you knew where he was.

527
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,593
We'll get him.

528
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,600
HARRY: Why don't you pull over
right here?

529
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:22,797
GIB: What's up?

530
00:43:24,006 --> 00:43:26,600
HARRY: I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

531
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,444
I'm going to run in and see
if she's available for lunch...

532
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:34,575
to smooth things over.

533
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:37,245
- You just want me to hang?
- Yeah. Just hang.

534
00:43:37,286 --> 00:43:38,617
GIB:
OK, buddy, I' II just be hanging.

535
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,186
ALLISON: Hold, please.

536
00:43:46,229 --> 00:43:49,926
Helen,
it's your mystery man on two.

537
00:43:49,966 --> 00:43:51,160
HELEN: Simon?

538
00:43:52,435 --> 00:43:54,562
Oh, my God!

539
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,506
Hello? Simon?

540
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:03,810
Yes, I can talk.

541
00:44:07,717 --> 00:44:08,877
You mean right now?

542
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,747
Yes... I can meet you.

543
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:16,019
OK. I can't wait.

544
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:17,491
Bye.

545
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:20,489
Can you cover me
for an hour?

546
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,124
ALLISON: Just an hour? Tell that
stud to take more time!

547
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,598
HELEN: Would you shut up?

548
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,898
I should have never
told you about him.

549
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:31,031
ALLISON: [Giggling]
Have a good time!

550
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:34,836
Get a little bitfor me
while you're at it!

551
00:44:39,482 --> 00:44:41,473
[Honk]

552
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:46,388
GIB: Hey, hold it!

553
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:47,557
Fucker.

554
00:44:47,557 --> 00:44:49,582
What's going on, man?
You sick or something?

555
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,990
Looks like you got gut-kicked.

556
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:56,726
HARRY: It' s Helen... it's Helen.
It's Helen.

557
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:58,597
GIB: It has something to do
with Helen, I' m guessing.

558
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:00,966
- Helen...
- Helen...

559
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:02,334
GIB: Helen...

560
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:06,569
Helen... is having an affair.

561
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:12,908
GIB: Welcome to the club, man.

562
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:17,842
Nobody thinks it can happen
to them the first time.

563
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,855
Same thing happened to me
with wife number two.

564
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,948
I had no idea.
Nothing's going on, right?

565
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,516
I come home one day,
the house is completely empty.

566
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,825
She even took the ice cube trays
from the freezer.

567
00:45:27,863 --> 00:45:32,493
What kind of a sick bitch
takes the ice cube trays?

568
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:35,763
HARRY: Not Helen.

569
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:38,638
GIB: Hey, Harry.
Listen, Helen still loves you.

570
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:40,869
She just wants to bang this guy
for a while.

571
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,545
It's nothing serious.

572
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:45,946
Stop cheering me up!

573
00:45:49,418 --> 00:45:51,147
What'd you expect, Harry?

574
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:53,417
Helen's a flesh-and-blood
woman, and you're never there.

575
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,687
It was just a matter of time.

576
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:05,924
You know what?
I say we concentrate on work.

577
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:08,596
That's what I do every time
my life turns to dogshit.

578
00:46:08,638 --> 00:46:10,663
I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

579
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:12,640
This is gonna be great.

580
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:14,404
We're gonna catch
some terrorists...

581
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:15,933
we're gonna beat
the crap out of them...

582
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:18,105
you're gonna feel
a hell of a lot better.

583
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:19,808
Watch your head now.

584
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:21,544
OK. All right.

585
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:31,817
Women... can't live with them,
can't kill 'em.

586
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:35,194
[Thunder]

587
00:46:44,573 --> 00:46:46,473
[Spoon clatters]

588
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:50,869
I came by your office today.

589
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:53,374
I was in the area...

590
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,417
and I thought that
you might want to have lunch.

591
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:00,453
R-really?
You must've just missed me.

592
00:47:01,624 --> 00:47:04,354
HARRY: They said you had to run
out or something like that.

593
00:47:04,393 --> 00:47:06,361
HELEN: It was this rush job.

594
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:10,225
They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

595
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,501
And so of course,
the big problem?

596
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:14,968
Our printer shut down.

597
00:47:15,004 --> 00:47:16,869
I went to the thirdfloor
to use theirs...

598
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:18,999
but they have the 1720...

599
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:22,670
and of course, the disk
isn'tformattedfor the 1720.

600
00:47:22,712 --> 00:47:25,510
So I have to go back
upstairs and reformat...

601
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:28,482
go back downstairs
and use their printer...

602
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:32,613
then I couldn't get
my car to start.

603
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:34,520
Then traffic...
Well, I barely got there.

604
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:41,962
That's a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

605
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:43,658
Did it work out OK?

606
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:47,763
Yeah. Great.

607
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:50,603
I'll check on dessert.

608
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,700
DANA: I' m done.

609
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:02,776
GIB: He's practically given us
a blank check on wiretaps.

610
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:05,446
I've set them up on Juno's
shipping agents and clients...

611
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,682
and Faisil' s made a list
of all the possible contacts...

612
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:09,486
the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

613
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:11,116
Now all we gotta do
is sit around...

614
00:48:15,464 --> 00:48:19,264
Hey, this national security
stuff boring you?

615
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:21,462
HARRY: Put a tap on her phone.

616
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:22,834
GIB: What are you talking about?
I already did that.

617
00:48:22,872 --> 00:48:24,339
HARRY:
I'm talking about Helen's.

618
00:48:24,407 --> 00:48:27,103
Put a tap on her office line
and my house. Do it now.

619
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:29,634
GIB: OK. Just come over here.
Sounds great.

620
00:48:29,678 --> 00:48:31,145
I just want to ask you
about something.

621
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,172
I got two words to describe
that idea... in-sane.

622
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,309
An unauthorized wiretap
is a felony.

623
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:38,149
HARRY: And we're doing it
twenty times a day!

624
00:48:38,187 --> 00:48:41,918
So don't give me that crap.
Do it.

625
00:48:54,036 --> 00:48:55,196
HELEN: Hello?

626
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:57,739
SIMON: Helen, it's Simon.
Is it safe to talk?

627
00:48:57,773 --> 00:48:59,331
HELEN: Yes. Go ahead.

628
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,842
SIMON: I can't talk long.

629
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:03,071
Can you meet me for lunch
tomorrow? I must see you.

630
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:05,910
I suppose so. Where?

631
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:07,550
SIMON: Same place. One o'clock.

632
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,552
I have to go now.

633
00:49:09,552 --> 00:49:11,452
See you tomorrow.

634
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,080
Remember, I need you.

635
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,264
[Thunder]

636
00:49:33,108 --> 00:49:36,077
HARRY: I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

637
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:42,112
HELEN: You know, darn it,
I'm meeting Allison.

638
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:44,676
We're going to go shopping.
Sorry.

639
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,745
No problem.

640
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,151
[Arf]

641
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:26,290
GIB: I think you're going
about this all wrong.

642
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:28,531
See, women like you
to talk to them.

643
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:31,159
And maybe you're not in touch
with yourfeminine side.

644
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,536
I was watching
Sally Jessy Raphael- -

645
00:50:33,536 --> 00:50:36,539
All right. OK.
I got the usual stuff here.

646
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:39,007
I got a telemetry-burst
transmitter, a GPS tracker...

647
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,032
an audio transmitter,
a power supply.

648
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,772
I've got it
sewn into the lining here...

649
00:50:43,812 --> 00:50:45,302
Hey, Harry?

650
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:48,316
If you need to talk...
speak into the purse.

651
00:50:52,955 --> 00:50:55,423
GIB: Here she comes,
right in front of us.

652
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:57,357
- Watch this. Bingo!
- Yep.

653
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:04,361
GIB: Looks like
she's going into Chinatown.

654
00:51:08,304 --> 00:51:09,601
GIB: OK, she's parking.

655
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:19,944
HARRY: OK, give me audio.

656
00:51:28,624 --> 00:51:29,955
SIMON:
You sure you weren'tfollowed?

657
00:51:32,328 --> 00:51:34,853
HELEN: No. I kept looking
behind me like you taught me...

658
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:36,990
but I didn't see anyone.

659
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:38,829
SIMON: It' s just things
are a bit hot right now.

660
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:43,304
If I get a signal,
I may have to leave suddenly.

661
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:44,863
I understand.

662
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:46,397
[Door bangs]

663
00:51:48,911 --> 00:51:52,642
SIMON: Look, it's my job
to take risks, but not yours.

664
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:55,149
I feel bad
about bringing you into this...

665
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:57,243
but you're the only one
I can trust.

666
00:51:59,088 --> 00:52:00,214
HELEN:
Were you out on a mission?

667
00:52:00,255 --> 00:52:03,884
SIMON: Shh. We say "op."

668
00:52:03,926 --> 00:52:05,188
Covert operation...

669
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:08,196
and this one,
well, got a little rough.

670
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,721
- Worse than Cairo?
- Cairo?

671
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:15,193
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

672
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:18,468
- The guy's a spook.
- Butfor whom?

673
00:52:18,507 --> 00:52:20,532
He could be working her
to get to you.

674
00:52:20,576 --> 00:52:23,545
SIMON: Did you read
the papers yesterday?

675
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:24,773
HELEN: Yes.

676
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:32,419
SIMON: Sometimes a story's
a mask for a covert operation.

677
00:52:32,454 --> 00:52:34,319
See " Two men killed
in a rest room...

678
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:38,349
and two unidentified men
in a shoot-out at the Marriott"?

679
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:40,089
That was you.

680
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:42,927
SIMON: You're very good.
You recognize my style.

681
00:52:42,965 --> 00:52:45,593
You're a natural at this.

682
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:48,068
GIB: The guy's a fake. He's
taking creditfor our moves.

683
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:50,697
- What happened?
- Hardly worth talking about.

684
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:53,542
Two of them
won't bother me again.

685
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:56,102
GIB: Unbelievable!

686
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:58,443
- You chased one?
- Something came over me.

687
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,074
I had to nail this guy
no matter what the risk.

688
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:03,209
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple of times...

689
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:06,415
but I really can't take credit.

690
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:07,615
Why not?

691
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,157
It's the training.

692
00:53:09,191 --> 00:53:11,489
It shapes you
into a lethal instrument.

693
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:12,361
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

694
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:13,350
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

695
00:53:13,562 --> 00:53:15,530
GIB: I' m starting
to like this guy.

696
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:19,125
We've still got to kill him.

I have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.

868
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:44,961
For me, fear is not an option.

869
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,936
Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

870
01:02:49,938 --> 01:02:51,337
we have to look
like two people...

871
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:53,466
who are completely
intimate with each other.

872
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:55,567
The enemy
can spot a fake easily.

873
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,413
[Gasps]

874
01:03:00,448 --> 01:03:02,882
- You see what I mean?
- I' m sorry.

875
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,578
SIMON: That reaction
could get us both killed.

876
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:06,553
- I' m sorry.
- We can't afford that.

877
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:08,556
HELEN: No. I' m sorry.

878
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:10,023
SIMON: Try to relax.

879
01:03:10,058 --> 01:03:12,560
HELEN: It' s just been
a long time...

880
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,994
since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

881
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:19,262
SIMON: I know.
It's awkwardfor me, too.

882
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:22,098
- I' m sorry.
- That's all right.

883
01:03:22,137 --> 01:03:23,764
- Just sit back.
- I' m OK.

884
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:26,535
SIMON: There. That's better.

885
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:29,941
Just let yourself...
slip into the role.

886
01:03:29,978 --> 01:03:31,445
HELEN: Mm-hmm.

887
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:40,647
SIMON: That's it.

888
01:03:42,157 --> 01:03:43,749
There we go.

889
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:48,892
- Just let yourself go.
- Mm-hmm.

890
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,557
SIMON: Yeah. That's good.

891
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:51,929
That's great.

892
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:55,061
That's it. Mmm.

893
01:03:55,103 --> 01:03:57,901
HELEN: No. I can't do this.
I can't do this.

894
01:03:57,939 --> 01:03:59,429
SIMON: What's wrong? It' s OK.

895
01:03:59,474 --> 01:04:02,034
HELEN: No. I cannot do this.
I cannot... do this!

896
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:08,238
If notfor me...

897
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:11,013
do itfor your country?

898
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:14,879
[Helicopter]

899
01:04:20,295 --> 01:04:21,990
Aah!

900
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:24,924
SIMON: Shit!

901
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:26,900
[Helen screaming]

902
01:04:36,444 --> 01:04:38,503
[Gun cocks]

903
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:41,778
SIMON: Ohh, God! Don't hurt me!

904
01:04:41,816 --> 01:04:45,252
Don't hurt me!
I'll do whatever you want. Oh!

905
01:04:46,688 --> 01:04:48,553
HELEN:
Please! I didn't do anything!

906
01:04:51,926 --> 01:04:53,553
Oh, no!

907
01:04:54,763 --> 01:04:56,458
GIB: Ohh!

908
01:04:56,498 --> 01:04:58,523
Goddamn it!

909
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,839
HARRY: No!

910
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:22,151
SIMON: Take her! Take her!

911
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,987
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

912
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:27,925
GIB: Oh! Ohh! Ow.

913
01:05:27,962 --> 01:05:31,227
Son of a bitch! Oh!

914
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,209
[Helen whimpers]

915
01:06:22,183 --> 01:06:24,174
DISTORTED VOICE ON SPEAKER:
Sit down.

916
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,312
I said sit down.

917
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:34,556
Who do you work for?

918
01:06:36,498 --> 01:06:40,901
HELEN: Um, Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krupnik.

919
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:44,236
I'm just a legal secretary.

920
01:06:44,272 --> 01:06:46,001
Sure, Mrs. Tasker.

921
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,600
What were you doing with
the international terrorist...

922
01:06:48,643 --> 01:06:50,975
Carlos the Jackal,
taking dictation?

923
01:06:51,012 --> 01:06:53,105
How long have you been
a member of his faction?

924
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,980
HELEN: I don't know anything
about a faction.

925
01:06:57,552 --> 01:07:00,453
I just met Simon...

926
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:02,956
or whoever you say he is...

927
01:07:02,991 --> 01:07:07,428
just a couple weeks ago.
I barely know him.

928
01:07:07,462 --> 01:07:09,623
GIB: That's not what it looked
like when we found you.

929
01:07:10,965 --> 01:07:12,956
How did you meet him?

930
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:17,463
Well, ahem...

931
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:29,581
SIMON: Keep this for me.

932
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:31,278
I can't afford
to be taken with it.

933
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:32,445
HELEN: What?

934
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:34,079
SIMON: It' s a matter
of national security.

935
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:35,487
- No.
- Please.

936
01:07:35,523 --> 01:07:38,014
SIMON: It' s important.
I'll contact you.

937
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:40,050
Shit.

938
01:08:12,627 --> 01:08:14,561
HARRY: Why did you
continue to see him?

939
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:17,030
HELEN:
He said he needed my help.

940
01:08:17,065 --> 01:08:20,034
HARRY: Not because
you were attracted to him?

941
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:21,501
HELEN: No!

942
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:24,699
HARRY: You were not attracted
to him at all?

943
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:26,331
HELEN: No.

944
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:32,580
Well, maybe just a little.

945
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:36,343
So, is cheating
a common thingfor you?

946
01:08:36,384 --> 01:08:37,681
No. Never.

947
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:40,187
You're telling me
this was yourfirst time?

948
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:42,917
HELEN: I wasn't cheating!

949
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:45,983
Tell me about your husband,
Mrs. Tasker.

950
01:08:46,027 --> 01:08:48,359
Harry?

951
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,998
L... l- -What can I say
about Harry?

952
01:08:56,371 --> 01:08:58,862
I mean, he's a sales rep
for a computer company.

953
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:02,569
So sex with him
isn't waving yourflag anymore?

954
01:09:02,644 --> 01:09:05,306
HELEN: That is none
of your goddamn business!

955
01:09:05,346 --> 01:09:06,547
What kind of questions
are these?

956
01:09:06,547 --> 01:09:09,550
HARRY: You're in trouble.
I suggest you cooperate.

957
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,347
If we want to know
intimate details...

958
01:09:11,386 --> 01:09:13,411
about your life,
you'd better tell us.

959
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:19,257
My husband is a good man.

960
01:09:19,293 --> 01:09:22,421
But he's not exactly
ringing your bell...

961
01:09:22,463 --> 01:09:24,863
Let me handle this part.
Do you mind?

962
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:29,092
HARRY: Why did you
go to Carlos' hideout?

963
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:33,972
HELEN: He wanted me to go to
Paris with him on a mission...

964
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:36,499
to... pose as his wife.

965
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:38,535
And you agreed?

966
01:09:40,148 --> 01:09:41,410
HARRY: Why?

967
01:09:43,217 --> 01:09:45,310
I don't know.

968
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:49,248
I guess I needed something.

969
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,781
What did you need?

970
01:09:56,764 --> 01:09:57,890
[Sighs]

971
01:09:57,932 --> 01:10:00,230
I needed to feel alive.

972
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,365
I just wanted
to do something outrageous.

973
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:13,339
And itfelt really good...

974
01:10:13,381 --> 01:10:15,008
to be needed.

975
01:10:19,454 --> 01:10:21,183
And to be trusted.

976
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:26,521
And to be special.

977
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:32,428
It's just that there's so much
I wanted to do with this life...

978
01:10:32,467 --> 01:10:35,300
and it's like
I haven't done any of it.

979
01:10:35,336 --> 01:10:37,804
And the sand's running
out of the hourglass...

980
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:41,297
and I wanted to be able
to look back and say...

981
01:10:41,342 --> 01:10:43,105
"See? I did that!

982
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:47,808
I was reckless, and I was wild,
and I fucking did it!"

983
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,786
[Helen sniffles]

984
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:58,281
Quite frankly, I don't give
a shit whether you understand.

985
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:01,957
HARRY: This Simon...

986
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,661
did you sleep with him?

987
01:11:07,702 --> 01:11:09,431
HELEN: No.

988
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:10,869
GIB: She's lying.

989
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,906
You mean you did not have
sexual relations with him?

990
01:11:17,678 --> 01:11:21,114
Listen, if you're going to
ask me every question twice...

991
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:23,583
this is going to take
a really long time...

992
01:11:23,618 --> 01:11:25,518
and I have to get back
to my family.

993
01:11:25,553 --> 01:11:28,044
GIB: You're not
going anywhere, lady.

994
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:30,558
Just let me out of here!

995
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,492
HARRY: Answer the question.

996
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:36,361
Answer the question!

997
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,058
No!

998
01:11:38,099 --> 01:11:41,193
I did not...

999
01:11:41,235 --> 01:11:43,999
sleep... with him!

1000
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,198
GIB: Calm down, please.

1001
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:48,538
HELEN: You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

1002
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:50,339
HARRY: Calm down.

1003
01:11:50,378 --> 01:11:52,403
GIB: She could be
telling the truth.

1004
01:11:52,446 --> 01:11:54,573
Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.

1005
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,081
Calm down, please.

1006
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:04,585
HARRY: I' ve only
one more question, Mrs. Tasker.

1007
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,889
HELEN: What?

1008
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,554
Do you...

1009
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:12,725
still love your husband?

1010
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:20,102
Yes, I love him.

1011
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:23,539
I've always loved him.

1012
01:12:24,545 --> 01:12:27,446
And I will always love him.

1013
01:12:32,253 --> 01:12:34,551
GIB: She loves you! Now what?

1014
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:38,889
[Helen sniffling]

1015
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:42,020
There's only one solution
to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.

1016
01:12:42,063 --> 01:12:44,964
You must work for us.

1017
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:46,933
[Helen sighs]

1018
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,094
What are you doing, Harry?

1019
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:50,535
Just giving her
a little assignment.

1020
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:51,936
You gotta be shitting me!

1021
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:55,033
HARRY: She wants an adventure.
I'm going to give her one.

1022
01:12:55,076 --> 01:12:57,067
I'm offering you a choice.

1023
01:12:57,111 --> 01:13:00,547
If you work for us,
we will drop the charges...

1024
01:13:00,581 --> 01:13:02,549
and you can go back
to your normal life.

1025
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:06,246
If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

1026
01:13:06,287 --> 01:13:07,982
and your husband and daughter...

1027
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:10,957
will be left
humiliated and alone.

1028
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:12,983
Your life will be destroyed.

1029
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:18,687
HELEN: Oh. Gee. Hmm.

1030
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:20,223
Let me think.

1031
01:13:20,268 --> 01:13:22,532
HARRY: Yes or no?

1032
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,266
Of course yes.

1033
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:26,671
What's involved?

1034
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:29,801
HARRY: You will be contacted
with the assignment.

1035
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:32,836
The code name
of your contact will be Boris.

1036
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:36,178
And your code name will be...

1037
01:13:36,217 --> 01:13:38,447
- Natasha?
- No.

1038
01:13:38,486 --> 01:13:41,284
Doris.

1039
01:13:52,466 --> 01:13:54,559
Pricks!

1040
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:05,278
HARRY: You son of a bitch.

1041
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:07,611
Did you think you could
elude us forever, Carlos?

1042
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:10,549
You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon!
