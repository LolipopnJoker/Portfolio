ROGER: Jeepers, Eddie,
that almost killed me!

675
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:09,896
Ow.

676
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,816
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

677
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,444
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.

678
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:19,072
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy,
a gin mill, a hooch parlor.

679
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,657
-Tools are up here, Eddie.
-Look at this!

680
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:23,035
-Aah !
-It's a spy hole!

681
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,787
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!

682
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,667
-Crazy Toon. Oof!
-Watch your head !

683
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,838
I thought you said
you'd never take another Toon case.

684
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,424
-What'd you have, a change of heart?
-Nothing's changed.

685
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,552
Somebody's made a patsy out of me,
and I'm going to find out why.

686
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,103
Hold still, will ya?

687
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,442
-Does this help?
-Yeah. Thanks.

688
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,697
You mean to tell me that

689
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,116
you could have taken your hand
out of that cuff at any time?

690
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,370
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.

691
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,788
Get out!

692
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,749
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

693
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,418
He always this funny, or only on days
when he's wanted for murder?

694
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,545
Listen, my philosophy is this.

695
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,799
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

696
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:22,594
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

697
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,263
-What is it, Eddie?
-EDDIE: Just look at it.

698
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:28,225
-Mr. Acme's will.
-Yeah.

699
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,394
And I think Maroon
played the part of sound mind

700
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,895
and your wife the sound body.

701
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,147
Why, I resent that innuendo!

702
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,025
-What's the scheme, Eddie?
-I don't think they got to the will.

703
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:38,944
But how do you know?

704
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,613
Because they were still looking
for it after they killed him.

705
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,989
Anything I can do?

706
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,117
Maybe you can go downtown
and check the probate.

707
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,536
Yeah, check the probate!

708
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,914
Why, my Uncle Thumper
had a problem with his probate,

709
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:55,127
and he had to take these big pills
and drink lots of water.

710
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:59,756
-Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
-Let me get this straight.

711
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,509
You think that my boss, R. K. Maroon

712
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,137
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head

713
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,639
so that he could get
his hands on Toontown?

714
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,599
Yeah.

715
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,101
That's my hunch.

716
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,814
Uh, can he stay here
for a couple of days?

717
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,192
He's not gonna do
anything crazy, is he?

Just name your price and I'll pay it.

I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.

Weren't you the one I caught playing
patty-cake with old man Acme?

735
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,514
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

736
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:34,351
-What are you talking about?
-Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

737

I didn't want to have anything
to do with it,

738
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:39,231
but he said if I didn't
pose for those patty-cake pictures,

739
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,858
Roger would never work
in this town again.

740

I couldn't let that happen.

I'd do anything
for my husband, Mr. Valiant.
