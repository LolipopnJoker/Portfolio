2
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,270
He said
four minutes precisely.

3
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,590
Non, non, non.

4
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,150
Quickly.

5
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,260
Two
perfect eggs this time, no?

6
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,770
Ah.

7
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,090
Hmm.

8
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,340
Maybe.

9
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,420
I blame the chicken.

10
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,100
Why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes?

11
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,410
It's not you, mon ami.

12
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,180
These are two
perfectly good oeufs.

13
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,400
Mr. Poirot...

14
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,100
I've got three religions
bent on riot.

15
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,880
If you're going to perform
one of your miracles,

16
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,130
the time is now.

17
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,940
Have the eggs. Allons-y!

18
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,420
Poirot!

19
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,290
Sorry for the, um...

20
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,820
It is not the, uh...

21
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,620
It is the imbalance of the...

22
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,500
Right.

23
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,810
That's better.

24
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,960
Excuse me.
Coming through.

25
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,380
Make way, please.
Excuse me.

26
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,180
Please call for the accused.

27
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,980
The rabbi...

28
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,300
the priest...

29
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,660
and the imam.

30
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,860
It is like the old joke, yes?

31
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,180
The rabbi, the priest,
and the imam.

32
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,180
Forgive me,
I am Belgian.

33
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,020
So, let us begin.

34
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,860
In the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre above us...

35
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,860
three representatives meet
under the supervision...

36
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,620
of the Chief
Inspector of Police

37
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,860
to discuss a divided timetable
for market use.

38
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,660
One hour after this
tense meeting...

39
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,860
a priceless relic
is found to be stolen.

40
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,740
It is said, one of these
three men has stolen it.

41
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,860
The police find no pieces
of evidence at all.

42
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,740
I find one.

43
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,740
On the meticulously
well-kept wall of a fresco...

44
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,740
a single crack
from an indelicate climb...

45
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,540
with a hard-soled shoe
or perhaps a boot.

46
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,260
So, ladies and gentlemen,
we must ask...

47
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,420
who stands to benefit
from the crime.

48
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,260
Our three holy men
live humbly.

49
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,860
They're thin-soled shoes poor.

50
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,420
Sudden riches
and rubies would be...

51
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,460
too conspicuous, yes,
to enjoy. They do not gain.

52
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,460
At this point, we need an armed
guard at the south gate.

53
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,820
Thank you very much.

54
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,260
No, the only one...

55
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,260
who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes...

56
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,090
is a man whose office
I had searched this morning...

57
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,580
as I waited,
I have to tell you,

58
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,420
rather disappointedly
upon my breakfast.

59
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,940
Difficulty with eggs.
You don't need to know this.

60
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,580
A man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in Jerusalem.

61
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,260
I mean, of course,

62
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,940
the Chief Inspector
of the Police.

63
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,780
A man who does not wish
to lose a well-paid post...

64
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,540
when there is discussion

65
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,620
among the local peoples
of self-governance...

66
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,260
who does wear boots, and who,
I believe, now does regret...

67
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,340
inviting me to
consult on this case.

68
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,340
How dare you accuse me!

69
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,780
Please, Sergeant...

70
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,660
did you search
the office as I asked?

71
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,970
Uh, yes, sir.

72
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,610
And did you find
what I said you might?

73
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,980
Uh, yes, sir.
Just as you said.

74
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,210
Merci.

75
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,630
Halt!

76
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,920
You need
to deliver that, Captain.

77
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,160
It should be through
first thing in the morning.

78
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,470
Very good, sir.

79
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,770
Luggage is on board, sir.

80
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,380
I won the right to escort you
to your boat.

81
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,220
To Stamboul, then?

82
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,020
Will you be back
to London straight off?

83
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,700
I am tired, and I have earned
myself a little holiday.

84
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,220
I want to look at paintings

85
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,900
and have too much time
on my hands.

86
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,220
You are staring.
Does it stop?

87
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,820
It's just...

88
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,740
How did you know
it was him, sir?

89
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,820
From just a tiny crack
on the wall.

90
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,500
I have the advantage...

91
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,580
I can only see the world
as it should be.

92
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,580
And when it is not,
the imperfection stands out...

93
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,020
like the nose
in the middle of a face.

94
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,380
It makes
most of life unbearable.

95
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,940
But it is useful
in the detection of crime.

96
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,340
But it's as though
you see into their hearts

97
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,700
and divine
their true natures.

98
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,260
And whatever people say,

99
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,260
there is right,
there is wrong.

100
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,060
There is nothing in between.

101
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,260
We must part here.

102
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,150
Oh, no, sir,
I'm to escort you on the ferry.

103
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,260
Au revoir, mon capitaine.

104
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,060
We must never meet again.

105
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,310
Could you straighten your tie,
please? Just a little.

106
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,100
Yes.
That is perfect.

107
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,380
Final passengers, please!

108
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

109
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,900
Will be fixed soon.

110
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,540
But, will it be
fixed in time?

111
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,690
We are working!

112
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,060
I have a connection
in Stamboul.

113
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,300
Leaves tomorrow at seven.

114
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,900
There's a very ill patient
waiting for me in London.

115
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,820
I am a doctor.

116
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,660
Doctor.

117
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,140
I am a doctor.

118
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,980
I am shouting at you
in English,

119
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,740
and now I'm doing it
louder and slower.

120
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,820
Very silly, forgive me.

121
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,660
May I help? Let me help.

122
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,340
I know your mustache.

123
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,500
From the papers.

124
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,780
You're the detective,
Hercules Poirot?

125
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,780
Hercule Poirot. I do not slay
the lions. Mademoiselle.

126
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,340
Mary Debenham, monsieur.

127
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,180
I'll forget a name
but never a face.

128
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,340
Not yours, anyway.

129
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,820
You come from Baghdad?

130
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,700
It's true. No detail
escapes his notice.

131
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,660
Your ticket.
Ah.

132
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,550
I might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there...

133
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,100
as a governess?

134
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,860
The chalk on your sleeve
and the geography primer.

135
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,540
A governess or a cartographer.
I made my gamble.

136
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,140
I always begin them
with geography...

137
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,610
and monster them till they
have the world down cold.

138
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,860
They may get lost in life...

139
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,300
but I'll be damned if they
don't know where they are.

140
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,380
Well, our chains are free.
Right on time.

141
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,140
I feel so free
out here on the water.

142
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,340
I wish I could enjoy it.

143
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,900
We should be
out of this, Mary.

144
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,250
Not now.

145
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,340
When it's all over.

146
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,980
When it's done.

147
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,420
Then, nothing can touch us.

148
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,740
Ah,
my holiday begins here.

149
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,180
I can see the soul of the city
in these humble breads.

150
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,860
The world insists
on destruction, yet here...

151
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,740
masterpieces are baked
to order every day.

152
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,390
Monsieur Poirot!

153
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,140
Mohammed!

154
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,870
Mohammed, my friend...

155
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,220
you are an artist.

156
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,180
Ah! My friend!

157
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,820
Sorry.

158
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,700
Here. Come, come.

159
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,120
Don't mind us,
we're just looking

160
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,600
for a place to have
a private argument.

161
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,220
It should take
some 20 minutes or so...

162
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,360
at which point we will both

163
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,960
come to an agreement,
or at least I will.

164
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,180
Monsieur Bouc!

165
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,900
Poirot! In the kitchen?

166
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,020
Well, of course,
this man will sniff out

167
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,640
a perfect pastry
faster than he catches...

168
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,670
a jewel thief.

169
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,220
Mon ami!

170
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,860
Now, I am no longer
a policeman.

171
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,820
I cannot bail you out
when this goes badly, eh?

172
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,340
This is my dear, old friend,
the esteemed...

173
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,180
Poirot, who I knew
before the esteem.

174
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,490
Hercule Poirot, this is...

175
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,670
A prostitute.
She is.

176
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,460
I am. Bouc, you did not tell
me you had famous friends.

177
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,600
We're friends because

178
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,680
I'm the only person
who never asks him...

179
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,380
any questions about his cases,
because I don't care.

180
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,320
And he never judges me
for being a terrible person.

181
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,380
Indeed you are.

182
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,100
Madame, Bouc,
please join me for a drink, yes?

183
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,660
You only have me
for an hour.

184
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,700
I ride on the Orient Express
at seven,

185
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,460
official director business.

186
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,180
Uncle pays me absurdly

187
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,710
to stay onboard
his gorgeous train...

188
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,940
and far away from him...

189
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,220
at the home office...

190
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,860
consigned to wine and dine

191
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,350
handsome officials
for all eternity.

192
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,610
There is an art to nepotism.

193
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,740
And you are
its Michelangelo!

194
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,830
Mr. Poirot.

195
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,070
Are you a prostitute as well?

196
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,500
Certainly not.

197
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,650
Is this man bothering you?

198
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,020
He is about to.

199
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,620
You are from
the British consulate.

200
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,380
I am, sir.
It is the Kassner case.

201
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,300
Why, yes.

202
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,260
I was correct
in certain predictions?

203
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,340
Quite.

204
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,070
I do not need
to read the telegram.

205
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,140
Oh, how fun.

206
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,780
Did someone cheat, or die?

207
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,460
Unfortunately, both.

208
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,420
Someone has...

209
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,220
interrupted my
longing for rest.

210
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,690
It appears that I must travel
with you tonight, Bouc.

211
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,780
Can you find me a cabin
on the Orient Express?

212
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,010
My friend...

213
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,020
I may not be good for much,
but I sure as hell

214
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,420
can get you a bed
on my train...

215
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,020
in the dead of winter.
Three days...

216
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,060
free of care, concern
or crime. You will love it.

217
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,860
Mademoiselle, it has
been a pleasure. Sir.

218
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,340
Your luggage
has been collected

219
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,980
and your expenses paid.

220
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,900
You will be met at Calais...

221
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,450
and then escorted to Dover,

222
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,700
and then by rail
to London Victoria.

223
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,260
I would like to formally

224
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,760
express gratitude.
Please, don't speak.

225
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,460
You make it worse.

226
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,670
Here's a tip for you, pal.
Thank you, Mr. Marquez.

227
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,000
I didn't even carry
your luggage.

228
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,170
Oh, I had a good week.

229
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,940
We celebrate
when fortune smiles,

230
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,820
and we share
the good fortune.

231
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,060
Remember to say nice things
about us Americans, huh?

232
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,860
No!

233
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,060
Hey, stop!

234
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,210
Monsieur, bonsoir.

235
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,580
For you, Mr. Ratchett,

236
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,500
the best table in the house.

237
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,300
Just here, sir.
The very best table.

238
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,220
No, I want that one.

239
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,460
Hey, Masterman.
You got everything?

240
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,700
Kind of you to inquire,
Mr. MacQueen.

241
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,620
I do not make mistakes.

242
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,690
Oh, my goodness!
It's Count Andrenyi.

243
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,930
Come, come, come.

244
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,860
I saw you dance
at the Monte Cristo.

245
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,740
Could I take your photograph?

246
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,740
Please, my face, no!

247
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,340
Sorry.

248
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,300
The Simplon Orient Express...

249
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,090
with stops in Sofia, Niš,
Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod...

250
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,460
with transfers
to Bucharest, Zagreb,

251
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,220
Trieste, Venezia,
Milan, Lausanne...

252
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,540
Dijon, Paris,
Boulogne, Calais...

253
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,150
with connection
to Dover and London,

254
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,370
leaves in fifteen minutes!

255
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,660
This way, Michel!
Precious cargo.

256
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,380
I need
a first-class compartment.

257
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,460
Give special care
to my friend, Michel.

258
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,060
I want him pampered
like a zoo panda.

259
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,280
But Monsieur Bouc,
we are fully booked.

260
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,340
There's no space left.

261
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,390
Then we make space.
He can have the number eleven.

262
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,310
The eleven is always kept
open for official use.

263
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,740
It's very comfortable.

264
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,910
Eleven is taken.

265
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,320
The Austrian professor
booked it two days ago.

266
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,470
There is not one first-class

267
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,790
sleeper car
on the whole train?

268
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,830
Negative, sir.

269
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,100
Second-class?
There's no space left at all.

270
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,900
Mademoiselle Debenham.

271
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,980
Mr. Poirot,
are you joining us?

272
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,140
It depends
who wins this debate.

273
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,620
Have all the passengers
arrived?

274
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,340
All but one. Mr. Harris.

275
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,870
"All passengers
must check in

276
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,030
"at least one half hour prior
to time of departure...

277
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,780
"or their seat
may be forfeit."

278
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,410
The half hour has passed.
The seat is forfeit.

279
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,340
Please take
Monsieur Poirot's luggage

280
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,700
to number three
with Mr. MacQueen.

281
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,940
Merci, Bouc.
Enjoy, my friend.

282
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,500
Welcome, sir.
Merci.

283
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,940
Number three is unlucky.

284
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,420
Oh!

285
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,860
Apologies, madame.
I meant no disrespect.

286
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,820
Well, you could try to mean
a little.

287
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,740
One thing about train travel,

288
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,780
you're always
knocking into somebody.

289
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,100
It's wonderful.

290
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,620
Though, I am looking forward
to getting back.

291
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,740
Travel is fine for spicy food,
mosques, meeting men.

292
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,220
But eventually, you just
miss your own bed.

293
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,170
I've been accused
of husband hunting abroad.

294
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,140
Well, I can't,
in all honesty, deny it.

295
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,420
I like my time alone, I do.

296
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,660
But a lady has certain needs

297
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,460
that deserve to be met
if she has any money...

298
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,460
and preferably,
on a regular basis.

299
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,140
Oh!

300
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,460
Oh, my!
Fire in the kitchen!

301
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,420
Farewell, madame.

302
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,440
Good evening.

303
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,470
Bonsoir.

304
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,700
Number nine.

305
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,660
Good evening.
Bonsoir, bonsoir.

306
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,340
How you doing?
Bonsoir.

307
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,020
Oh. Excusez-moi.

308
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,820
No, after you.

309
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,180
Merci, merci.

310
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,500
Ah number three.

311
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,620
You are Mr MacQueen?

312
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,620
Yeah. I think you might
have the wrong berth.

313
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,210
Uh...

314
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,500
Sorry, is there a problem sir?

315
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,140
No, no problem.

316
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,680
The train is full.

317
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,500
I think that we are,
how do you say... "bunkies."

318
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,250
Really?

319
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,220
I am equally disappointed
in you. This is nice.

320
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,790
Come along, darlings.

321
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,690
No.

322
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,690
No.

323
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,370
This?

324
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,330
Why am I not yet unpacked?

325
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,900
Five minutes to departure.

326
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,020
Final call for passengers!

327
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,780
Shall we brush you?

328
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,700
What the hell
is taking them so long?

329
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,680
Soon as we get out of here,
have them make up the bed.

330
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,000
It's already arranged,
Mr. Ratchett.

331
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,330
No, I want the bed made.
And bring my Dictaphone.

332
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,220
Dogs on the table.

333
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,500
Most disgusting thing
I've ever seen in my life.

334
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,260
Yes, sir.
I want you to get MacQueen...

335
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,990
and have him bring every
receipt from the Milan sale.

336
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,550
I want you to get it done.
Yes, sir.

337
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,140
I want you to get it done now.

338
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,410
Did I say get it done now?
Right away, sir.

339
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,900
"Better watch yourself."

340
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,860
Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett.

341
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,620
Who did this?

342
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,620
I can't say, sir.

343
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,030
Good evening,
Mrs. Hubbard.

344
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,750
Hello there,
Mr. Masterman.

345
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,010
Well, hello.

346
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,860
Eyes linger any longer,
I'll have to charge rent.

347
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,100
I'll pay.

348
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,030
Mmm. Have another drink.

349
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,380
Are you insulted?

350
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,660
Hmm. Disappointed.

351
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,180
Some men have a good look.

352
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,140
All they have to do is...

353
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,660
keep their mouth shut,

354
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,620
and they can take home
any prize they want.

355
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,980
Still, the mouth opens.

356
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,580
Is everything all right,
Mrs. Hubbard?

357
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,780
You have a strong intuition,
I know.

358
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:45,860
My second husband
used to say just so.

359
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,020
Hold that, it was my first.

360
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,190
Yeah.

361
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,060
Brightest man I ever met.

362
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,340
Face like a turnip,
but I loved that turnip.

363
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,860
It was nice to talk.

364
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,020
Good night.

365
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,310
Monsieur Poirot?

366
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,220
Entrez,
Pierre Michel.

367
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,630
Voilà.

368
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,660
When you take supper...

369
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,960
I will move Monsieur MacQueen

370
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,160
into Monsieur Bouc's
compartment.

371
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,780
You travel first class,
monsieur.

372
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,780
Ah, impeccable. Merci.

373
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,710
Bon appétit.

374
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,870
...and the eggs?

375
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,900
Good afternoon.

376
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,340
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard.

377
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,860
Good afternoon.

378
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,700
There we are.

379
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,700
Compliments
of the Orient Express.

380
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,300
Thank you, Mr. Bouc.

381
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,620
I am here
for all of your needs.

382
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,140
No, thank you.
I do not drink.

383
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,610
It does not
agree with you?

384
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,580
Sin does not agree with me.

385
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,980
Vice is where the devil
finds his darlings.

386
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,140
We should no longer speak.

387
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,660
Good afternoon.

388
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,380
Monsieur.
How about a apéritif?

389
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,260
I regret I have
an appointment

390
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,380
with the director
of the train.

391
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,930
He was gonna leave anyway.

392
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,100
Please, sir.
Madame, madame.

393
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,650
Madame, madame.

394
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,940
All settled in?

395
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,900
Ah, merci!
As advertised.

396
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,900
And yet, the best things
on the train are not food.

397
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,560
You know
there's something about...

398
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,260
a tangle of strangers
pressed together

399
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,880
for days on end,
with nothing in common...

400
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,900
but the need to go
from one place to another...

401
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,100
then never to see
each other again.

402
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,460
Boredom plus
anonymity plus a...

403
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,620
constant, gentle rocking.

404
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,300
With your hobbies, you will
never amount to anything.

405
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,940
God, I hope so.
Hmm.

406
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,460
Order me the fish.

407
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,460
Um, exchange grouper for sole,

408
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,100
escarole for the potato,
and...

409
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,460
the beef sauce
for the velouté.

410
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,420
Garçon, that sounds superb.
The same for me.

411
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,500
The Princess Dragomiroff.

412
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,980
You know, if I ever were
to marry for money,

413
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,580
I'd marry for
that much money.

414
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,970
I brushed Dalia this morning.

415
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,780
No, you tortured
my darling doggy.

416
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,170
I asked you to brush her.

417
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,500
Are you still enjoying
your Dickens?

418
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,500
Very much, mon ami.

419
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,580
You know, with your books
and your capers,

420
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,340
you are missing out
on romance.

421
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,970
Romance never
goes unpunished.

422
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,020
There was, uh...

423
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,820
There was someone once.

424
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,180
I would prefer, in the future,
to be sat not with that man.

425
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,770
Like should be seated
with like.

426
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,820
We are not alike.

427
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,300
Not all of us
are so concerned

428
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,820
with the separateness
of races, Professor.

429
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,220
It is out of respect
for all kinds

430
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,810
that I prefer
to keep them separate.

431
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,980
To mix your red wine
and the white

432
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,020
would be to ruin them both.

433
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,220
I like a good rosé.

434
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,780
Hey, how you doing?
Would you mind...

435
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,380
if I joined you?

436
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,820
Dessert is an indulgence...

437
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,940
and I feel kinda silly
and stupid indulging alone.

438
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,570
I am at my happiest alone.

439
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,500
But...

440
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,460
for a small piece
of your fragelité,

441
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,610
please join me.

442
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,220
Oh, with pleasure.
Excuse me, another fork?

443
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,960
I've been trying to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Poirot.

444
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,990
Merci.

445
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,410
I never ever sat so close
to fame before.

446
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,620
No, I tell a lie.

447
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,660
Once, I was on a bus
with Ty Cobb.

448
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,450
Ball player, Detroit.
Ah.

449
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,980
Would you mind if I have the
little curly bit at the top?

450
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,420
You're an odd bird there.

451
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,660
You're a strange,
peculiar man.

452
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,890
I am of an age

453
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,940
where I know what I like
and what I do not like.

454
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,980
What I like,
I enjoy enormously.

455
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,500
What I dislike,
I cannot abide.

456
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,180
For instance,
the temporary pleasantries

457
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,020
before what is determined
to be a business discussion.

458
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,140
You're fun.

459
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,500
All right.

460
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,860
I would like
to offer you a job.

461
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,700
"The avenger of the innocent."

462
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,160
It's what they call you
in the papers.

463
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,500
And you are an innocent?

464
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,300
I'm a businessman.

465
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:15,300
I'm an art dealer.
I mean, I'm new to it.

466
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,300
But my beginner's luck
has panned out.

467
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,780
Relics, antiquities.

468
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,140
Rugs, weird. Orientals.

469
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm new to the game,
so I got the amateur eyeball.

470
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,540
But I got a little problem
with these, uh...

471
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,780
so-called appraisers.

472
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,900
You can't trust
a one of 'em.

473
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,020
Some of my customers...

474
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,210
they buy a piece...

475
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,500
they find out that they're
not exactly original...

476
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,060
which is hardly my fault...

477
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,900
if a Kashan silk scarf
is a fake.

478
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,130
Right? Huh?

479
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,530
C'est bon.

480
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,420
But I've managed to make
a few enemies, is the thing.

481
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,740
I got a few letters,
people making threats.

482
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,380
I think, most likely,
it's the Italians.

483
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,980
I sold them a set of
Oriental carpets in Milan.

484
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,100
And the buyers weren't
so happy with the provenance.

485
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,260
And they want their money back
with interest, you know?

486
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,350
Italians.

487
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,420
A guinea's a guinea.

488
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,020
And then comes along
the genius detective.

489
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,410
Me?

490
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,020
Yes, you. Hercules Poirot.
Hercule.

491
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,340
Um...

492
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,860
Here's what I'd like to do.

493
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,060
I would like to hire you
to watch my back...

494
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,300
until I get someplace safe.

495
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,780
It's easy money for you.

496
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,780
And it's peace of mind
for me, you know?

497
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,620
I understand.
Good.

498
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,790
I refuse.

499
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,900
I'm sorry? That's bad.

500
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,380
Maybe I didn't make
myself clear enough.

501
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:04,540
You see,
someone's out to get me.

502
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,580
And I know I'm not the best
guy born, not by a long shot.

503
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,380
And if there's a world
after this one,

504
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,740
I will face judgment
just like you.

505
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,830
But...

506
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,780
I ain't in no goddamn
rush to do it.

507
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,140
You're holding a gun on me?
No.

508
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,940
Not you. On the world.

509
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,490
I exist in the world.
Do not point a gun at me.

510
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,340
How's ten thousand
sound for a week?

511
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,550
It's a generous offer,
Mr. Ratchett. I must decline.

512
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,670
Fifteen thousand?

513
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,950
You didn't hear me. I decline.

514
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,500
Oh, I get it.

515
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:41,180
It's not flashy enough for the
great Hercules Poirot, huh?

516
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,410
No flashbulbs...

517
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,640
You sell fakes to gangsters.

518
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,300
You're suffering
the consequences.

519
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,580
I detect criminals.
I do not protect them.

520
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,260
So you say "no"
to my dirty money.

521
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,340
I say "no" to you,
Mr. Ratchett.

522
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,620
Business with the gun, right?
Is that what it was?

523
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,980
It is far more personal
than that.

524
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,700
I do not like your face.

525
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,020
If you will excuse me.

526
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,180
You liked my cake,
didn't you?

527
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,780
The cake was excellent.

528
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,300
Have a pleasant afternoon,
Mr. Ratchett.

529
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,060
Thank you.

530
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,290
Ooh! Cold.

531
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,380
Hmm.

532
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,300
Mysweet Katherine.

533
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,820
My love.

534
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,260
Mr. Dickens.

535
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,140
Mr. Ratchett?

536
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,060
Mr. Ratchett?

537
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,420
It's nothing.

538
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,100
Very good sir.

539
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,150
Good night.

540
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,310
Mrs. Hubbard?

541
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,260
It's always Mrs. Hubbard.

542
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,900
Mrs. Hubbard.

543
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,380
Did we die?

544
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has been derailed.

545
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,520
Are you all right,
Mr. Marquez?

546
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,460
I'm fine. Thank you.

547
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,680
You'll be
safest in your cabins.

548
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,020
Mr. Bouc will speak
to you all...

549
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,220
in the morning.

550
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,680
Please, you will be safest
in your cabins.

551
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,900
Of course.

552
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,900
Are we gonna die?

553
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,410
Oh...

554
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,380
MyKatherine.

555
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,540
Mybeautiful...

556
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,740
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am afraid

557
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,340
that our train is still
unable to go anywhere.

558
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,570
Yeah, except down.

559
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,390
How long are we supposed
to just sit here?

560
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,890
Yes, someone must
be doing something.

561
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,940
Of course I am doing
something. I am doing nothing.

562
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,540
Precisely two hours
and ten minutes ago,

563
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,660
when we did not arrive
in Brod as scheduled...

564
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,950
the station master will have
surmised our situation...

565
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,740
and already dispatched a team
to excavate the engine...

566
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,140
clear our path,
and send us on our way.

567
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,500
Until then, I assure you...

568
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,060
we will all be made warm
and fed and comfortable.

569
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,910
We could walk.

570
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,700
We could die
of exposure trying.

571
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,780
I have a connection to make.

572
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,820
My boat sails day after
tomorrow from France.

573
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,580
Without you, I'd wager.
Or me in London.

574
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,260
I hold you accountable for
my loss of time, Mr. Bouc.

575
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,200
Madam, you cannot hold me
accountable for the weather.

576
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,300
Of course I can.
You're the one here.

577
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,580
And my conference
in Turin?

578
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,980
And I was to meet at
the auto factory in Sochaux.

579
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,890
Yes, some things,
they are in God's hands.

580
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,460
It is not for us to say...

581
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,060
if we deserve to arrive safely
at our destination...

582
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,060
or if, like Lucifer,
we must fall.

583
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,490
Breakfast for you,
Mr. Ratchett.

584
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,980
Ah, Bonjour,
Mr. Masterman.

585
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,900
There is a problem?

586
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,500
I can't say, sir.

587
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,100
Mr. Ratchett?

588
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,420
Excuse me.

589
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,820
That is cold air.

590
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,940
Please bring Monsieur Bouc
immediately,

591
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,980
and also Dr. Arbuthnot.

592
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,340
Good God!

593
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,860
Touch nothing else,
only the body.

594
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,420
My God,
this is horrible.

595
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,090
First the snow, now...

596
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,440
I'll have to meet
with the police

597
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,270
and make some statement
in some grimy station.

598
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,460
And a man has died.

599
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,780
And a man has died.

600
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,060
He was stabbed.

601
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,370
Long, straight-edged knife.

602
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,140
Multiple stab wounds,
some shallow,

603
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,740
some cut clean through muscle.

604
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,480
Left-hand side
or right-hand side?

605
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,220
That's the thing.

606
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,140
It appears the killer

607
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,580
maybe closed his eyes
and struck blind.

608
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,180
Can you estimate
the time of death?

609
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,700
It's hard
to say with the window open...

610
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,780
but my best guess
is between midnight and 2:00.

611
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,280
But no one went
in his compartment then.

612
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,420
I sat in my seat all night.

613
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,500
I would have seen if someone
went in. It's impossible.

614
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,200
Thank you, Doctor. Please,
return to the dining car.

615
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,220
Michel, secure this carriage.

616
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,860
Poirot.

617
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,100
I need your help, my friend.

618
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,940
You have to find
who did this.

619
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,220
Please, I implore you,

620
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,900
on behalf
of the Orient Express.

621
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,030
When the police arrive,

622
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,280
we can present them
with the case closed.

623
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,340
You are the only one
who can save me.

624
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,660
Your faith touches me,
mon cher.

625
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,500
But I must have this rest.

626
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,700
Well, think of it as a little
beachside puzzle.

627
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,780
That's nothing to your mind!

628
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,020
You look up the antecedents
of the passengers.

629
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,390
You establish
their bona fides.

630
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,580
Then you do what you do.
You... You... You...

631
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:19,100
You sit in a chair
and you eat your cake...

632
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,420
and you think until
the solution presents itself.

633
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,560
What else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow?

634
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,710
Without constant
stimulation,

635
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,280
your little gray cells
will starve and die.

636
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,720
You think that is what I do?
I sit in a chair...

637
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,800
and I have
a little piece of cake,

638
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,120
and then I come up
with a great idea?

639
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,640
I don't know what you do.
I have my Dickens.

640
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,260
Damn your Dickens!

641
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,310
If we leave this
to the police,

642
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,510
they will choose a culprit...

643
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,740
right or wrong,
and they will hang him.

644
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,100
Most probably Mr. Marquez...

645
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,420
for no other reason
than his name is Marquez.

646
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,220
Or Dr. Arbuthnot for
the color of his skin.

647
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,740
You are the only one
who can bring justice.

648
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,040
Let me have a map
of this coach.

649
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,070
Of course.

650
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,150
Every passport.
Anything.

651
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,100
Interviews arranged
with all of our passengers.

652
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,300
Evidence, order and method,
until one culprit emerges.

653
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,300
I do not approve
of murder, my friend.

654
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,510
Every day, we meet people

655
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,680
the world could
do better without...

656
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,930
yet we do not kill them.

657
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,740
We must be better
than the beasts.

658
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,930
So let us find this killer.

659
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,660
What's going on?

660
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,020
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to, um...

661
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,820
It appears that our bad luck
has worsened.

662
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,030
That is...

663
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,180
A passenger has died
on the train.

664
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,980
Monsieur Ratchett.

665
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,860
Looks like they
got him after all.

666
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,980
You assume
he was killed?

667
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,700
No, no.

668
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,540
I just mean he was
in perfectly good health.

669
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,180
He had his enemies,
that's all.

670
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,380
Indeed, he did.
He was murdered.

671
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,820
Good God. Murder, here?

672
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,210
Alas, madame.

673
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,220
God rest his soul.

674
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,060
Someone was rummaging
around my cabin

675
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,420
in the middle of the night.

676
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,580
Nobody would believe me.

677
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,700
What is going on?

678
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,030
As we are snowbound,

679
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,390
I have elected
to take the case...

680
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,980
and find for my friend,
Monsieur Bouc, the criminal.

681
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,780
And why you?

682
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,780
My name is Hercule Poirot...

683
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,580
and I am probably the greatest
detective in the world.

684
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,440
I will speak
to all of you in time.

685
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,780
For the moment...

686
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,160
I must recommend
that you remain

687
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,720
in your compartments
with the doors locked.

688
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,420
I feel like a prisoner here.

689
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,970
It is
for your own safety.

690
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,260
If there was a murder...

691
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,420
then there was a murderer.

692
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,300
The murderer is with us...

693
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,140
on the train, now.

694
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,020
The doors between coaches
were locked at night, hmm?

695
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,020
Absolutely.
Done myself.

696
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,320
The train's
been searched.

697
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,720
There's no one hiding
on it or under it.

698
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,050
We can therefore
limit our investigation

699
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,580
to the occupants
of the Calais coach.

700
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,660
Bouc, you will assist me.

701
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,600
As the only traveler
who slept in another coach...

702
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,620
you are the only one
who is not a suspect.

703
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,700
Mr. MacQueen, is this
really the time for drinking?

704
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,620
My boss is dead.

705
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,420
I'm out of a job,

706
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,140
and you're looking at me
like I did it.

707
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,530
We make no accusations.

708
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,980
You knew him,
so from here

709
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,390
we must glean
the essential facts.

710
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,380
Were you his relative?

711
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,020
No, his secretary.

712
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,860
Book his travel,
order his steaks.

713
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,250
The man ate more steak

714
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,460
than I've ever seen
in my entire life.

715
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,780
He was in antiques.

716
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,500
He had no qualification
for it,

717
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,710
not the eye
or the languages.

718
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,700
Truth is, he had no head
for business, accounting...

719
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,180
none of it.

720
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,540
I took care of everything.

721
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,170
How long were you
in his employ?

722
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:11,180
Twenty days shy of a year.

723
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,970
Prohibition
wasn't to my taste...

724
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,940
so I found myself overseas,
and in debt.

725
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,820
I'm a lawyer by education...

726
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,820
not disposition.

727
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,140
I was downright awful at it.

728
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,180
You were fond of him?

729
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,730
I was fond of his money.

730
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,020
Ratchett was crude...

731
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,300
demanding, insulting,
and most likely a felon.

732
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,300
When did you
last see him?

733
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,380
It must have been
just after 10:00.

734
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,620
He called me in to go
over our sales in Italy.

735
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,380
Milan,
the sale of forgeries?

736
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,460
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:55,180
He wanted to look over
the accounts.

738
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,100
I had to translate
everything...

739
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,360
as the contracts
were in French

740
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,860
and he didn't speak a word.

741
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,060
And when we stopped
at Vinkovci...

742
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,820
I struck up a chat with
the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.

743
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,100
And we had a couple of drinks,
stretched our legs.

744
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,270
He had some...

745
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,130
odd opinions about Stalin
I had to turn around.

746
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,820
I don't hold
a man's race against him,

747
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,900
but I don't often
take to Britishers.

748
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,420
When did your party end?

749
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,380
He left just after 2:00.

750
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,980
Did you know
of any specific enemies

751
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,740
Ratchett might have had?

752
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,260
Gosh.

753
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,780
Pick a number.

754
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,660
He confided
he had been threatened?

755
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,540
He got a couple
of nasty letters.

756
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,020
I have them if you like.
Some, anyway.

757
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,340
He tore up the rest.

758
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,260
Threw them into the fire.

759
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:44,790
That's them.

760
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,020
Merci, Mr. MacQueen.

761
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,190
Uh, thank you.

762
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,520
If we have
any further questions,

763
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,340
we will call for you again.

764
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,350
Have you considered
the Latin man?

765
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,930
Marquez. Hell of a guy.

766
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,700
And, well, you know,
his kind...

767
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,300
they don't have
the same distaste for murder,

768
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,060
historically speaking.

769
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,060
You said you don't hold
a man's race against him.

770
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,370
I suppose...

771
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,620
depends on the race.

772
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,540
And he was doing so well.

773
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,460
You think it's MacQueen?
Too early to say.

774
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,700
I admit, I cannot see him

775
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,200
stabbing a man twelve times
in a frenzy.

776
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,660
Not sober, anyway.
Who did it then?

777
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,420
I do not know yet.
It is time we ask.

778
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,500
Ask who?
The victim.

779
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,940
He has
twelve stab wounds

780
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,760
and, as Arbuthnot said,
they are patternless.

781
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,930
If the doctor is guilty...

782
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,480
he certainly did not
let it influence

783
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,620
his responsibilities.

784
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,860
Hey, the watch.
Stopped at 1:15.

785
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,840
Now that agrees with the
doctor on the time of death.

786
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,950
Hmm. It is possible,
yes. Certainly possible.

787
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,120
I don't
quite understand.

788
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,440
I do not understand,
myself.

789
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,610
I understand nothing at all.

790
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:34,660
If you look
at these two wounds...

791
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,020
they are powerful and deep,
and yet there is little blood.

792
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,780
But this was
a frenzied attack.

793
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,620
Lashing here and there.

794
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,500
No pattern at all,
just extreme violence.

795
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,380
And during all this,
our victim,

796
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,540
vigorous and anxious
and full of coffee...

797
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,060
merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle...

798
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,980
when he also has here...

799
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,500
the means by which
he might defend himself.

800
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,820
For you.

801
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,550
Now, let us see here.

802
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,820
Barbital. The Mickey slipped.

803
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,340
Drugged him
so he couldn't use this.

804
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,980
And later around here,
a lady's handkerchief.

805
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,180
An objet de luxe, handmade.

806
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:20,660
Boom, two hundred francs
in Paris.

807
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,340
And she even has
an initial, "H."

808
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,900
And our little friend,

809
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,780
the pipe cleaner.
Another clue.

810
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,620
Yes, a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently.

811
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,460
Yet only one appears, however,
to be perhaps genuine.

812
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,060
And maybe
this ashtray provides

813
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,500
the accidental breadcrumb.

814
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,700
A charred fragment of a note.

815
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,020
An attempt, perhaps,
to burn evidence.

816
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,710
Merci, monsieur.

817
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,160
We may borrow
your equipment, yes?

818
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,190
Thank you.

819
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,500
Merci, merci.

820
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,100
Now,
I prefer to understand...

821
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,500
why a clue is left rather than
what the object is.

822
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:11,260
We seek the truth from
within, not without.

823
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,540
In this case, however,

824
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,500
I may welcome a little
scientific assistance.

825
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,220
You will adjust the flame.

826
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,780
It's just another one
of those nasty letters.

827
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,880
You are mistaken, mon ami.

828
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:33,100
This one has a secret to tell.

829
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,420
Look.

830
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,260
"As a strong blood
is on hand, you will die."

831
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,220
What does this mean?

832
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,300
Come with me, Bouc.

833
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,940
Let us fill in the gaps.

834
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,740
This was never
a beachside puzzle.

835
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,050
I know the dead man's
real name.

836
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:04,940
It is not Ratchett,
but Cassetti.

837
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,500
I know that name.

838
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,100
Then you will also know
the name Armstrong.

839
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,260
The Armstrong case?

840
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,460
The story
shocked the world.

841
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,630
Two years ago...

842
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:16,940
the renowned pilot,
Colonel John Armstrong...

843
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,500
and his wife, Sonia,

844
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:21,140
woke to find their
only child, little Daisy...

845
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:24,300
taken from her crib
as she slept.

846
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:26,650
Desperate...

847
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,620
the Armstrongs
paid the ransom.

848
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,820
But soon after,
Daisy was found murdered by...

849
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:36,610
Ratchett,
who was Cassetti.

850
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,900
Sonia Armstrong
was with child

851
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,660
when she received the news.

852
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,820
The shock sent her
into premature labor.

853
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,820
Neither she
nor her baby survived.

854
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,460
How do you know this,
Poirot?

855
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,980
Because John Armstrong
told me so himself.

856
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,980
He wrote to me to ask me
for my help.

857
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,140
By the time
I received his letter...

858
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,180
it was too late.

859
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,460
He was found dead
of a gunshot wound.

860
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,460
Self-inflicted.

861
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,020
"Daisy Armstrong's blood
is on your hands.

862
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,180
"You will die for it."

863
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,860
Indeed, you did.

864
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:19,860
Monsieur Poirot?
Yes, Michel.

865
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,700
Mrs. Hubbard wants
to speak to you.

866
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,700
I held her as best as I could.

867
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,140
Ah, Mrs. Hubbard,
I'm sorry to have kept you.

868
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,480
You have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words.

869
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,740
You're goddamn right, I do.
What I have been trying...

870
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,740
to tell you all day.

871
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,580
The murderer was in
my compartment last night.

872
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,330
I thought I'd be killed.
Turns out I might have been...

873
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,260
only he got Ratchett instead.

874
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,710
I woke up in the dark,
and I knew

875
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,830
there was a man in my room.

876
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,500
You are certain
it was a man?

877
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:51,860
I know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom.

878
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:55,340
I told your conductor,
and he wouldn't believe me.

879
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,020
I said, "Check the
communication door

880
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,350
"between my room
and Ratchett's.

881
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,380
"He must have
left through there."

882
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,260
Sure enough, it was unbolted.

883
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:04,940
I know I locked it...

884
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,060
after what Ratchett said.

885
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,660
He made a rather
overt overture.

886
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,780
Have you perhaps...

887
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,580
heard of
the Armstrong kidnapping?

888
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,380
You couldn't avoid it.

889
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,820
Morbid stuff.

890
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:22,060
The child's murderer,
Cassetti...

891
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,700
died last night.

892
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,250
Ratchett was the man.

893
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,890
I told you, I knew he was
a rotten one.

894
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,390
You do believe me...

895
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,660
about the man in my room?

896
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,900
I'm aware you think
I'm a silly woman.

897
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,260
But I have proof it's true.

898
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,280
It is
from the uniform...

899
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,820
of an Orient Express
conductor...

900
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,120
but it might have
fallen from Michel's

901
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:50,370
when he was in your room.

902
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:52,740
I'm not missing any.

903
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:53,830
I found it

904
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,120
at the foot of my bed,
on the cover...

905
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,980
right where I slept.

906
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,150
What do you call that?

907
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,700
I call it evidence. Thank you
so much, Mrs. Hubbard.

908
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,870
Have you ever
been to America?

909
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,500
Once.

910
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,420
Years ago, briefly.

911
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,340
For what purpose?

912
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,620
To confirm a suspicion.
Which was?

913
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,180
That I wouldn't like it.

914
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,020
I was offered
a post in Boston.

915
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,860
Saw Boston,
went straight back to London.

916
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,340
Is that where
Ratchett was from?

917
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,740
Boston?
I can't says I know.

918
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,260
It wouldn't be proper...

919
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,060
to ask.

920
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:30,990
Carry on.

921
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,540
I last saw...

922
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,940
Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock.

923
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:40,180
I brought his coffee
and hung up his clothes.

924
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,090
You have a toothache, I think.

925
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,100
I've got an extraction booked
in London this week.

926
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,780
Mr. Ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer.

927
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,150
He said
he was tired of hearing

928
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,290
my suppressed groans.

929
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,590
This sympathetic Ratchett...

930
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,310
was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night?

931
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,740
Not at all. But he'd been
very agitated lately.

932
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,820
Said he wanted to stay alert,
especially so last night.

933
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,370
He found a letter
in his compartment.

934
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,580
Please tell me
you didn't do this.

935
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,240
If I were to leave
something unpleasant

936
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,380
on your pillow, sir...

937
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,180
it would not be a letter.

938
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,620
Coffee.

939
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,500
Surely, such a...

940
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,700
proper and precise valet...

941
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,780
would never speak
to his master as you did?

942
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:36,300
Unless he knew his career
was coming to a sudden...

943
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,780
end.

944
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:43,020
No mere toothache, I think.

945
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:45,330
The lungs?

946
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,740
The thyroid.

947
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,530
Spread now to stomach.

948
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,300
Same as got my father,
five years younger.

949
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,700
Months at best.

950
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,420
"Inoperable, I'm afraid,"
said the doctor.

951
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,580
And suddenly,
I wasn't... afraid.

952
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,460
I would only do what
I wanted from here on.

953
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,690
I speak my mind now.

954
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:12,420
The coffee.

955
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,060
It appears that his cup
was laced with barbital.

956
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,230
You, of course,
will tell me

957
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:17,360
that you did not
put it in there.

958
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,390
Of course I didn't.

959
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:20,020
When and from where

960
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,980
did you procure
the coffee and the cups?

961
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,780
In the kitchen, sir.

962
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:28,180
I ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9:00, and so it was.

963
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,540
Anybody could have got
a hold of it before me.

964
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,250
Merci.

965
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,940
Mr. Masterman.

966
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,380
I'm sorry about the toothache.

967
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,300
Merci.

968
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,460
I love the little cakes.

969
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,220
So, Miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary...

970
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,430
but you trained as a nurse

971
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:01,870
before you changed
professions, yes?

972
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,060
I owed it to God.

973
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,610
You owed Him a debt?

974
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,540
There were...

975
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,100
indulgent times in my life...

976
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:18,620
when I took more than I gave.

977
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,060
Gerhard Hardman.

978
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,900
Professor of engineering.

979
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:25,820
It is science
that will win back

980
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,620
for Germany her pride.

981
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,780
- Biniamino Marquez.
- Mr. Marquez.

982
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,090
Listen, I wanna be clear

983
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,630
of any association
with the crime...

984
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,780
so please ask me anything.

985
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,250
Anything. I never lie anymore.

986
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,420
Did you leave your compartment
at all last night?

987
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,740
Only once, to get an aspirin.

988
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:44,470
Mrs. Hubbard offered me
something earlier.

989
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,580
I declined at first,
but when I couldn't rest...

990
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,420
I went to ask for it.

991
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,820
My conference is in Turin.

992
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,860
I am the only Austrian
to present,

993
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,700
which means without me...

994
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,940
the talks will
be substandard.

995
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,380
Then I escaped prison,

996
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,100
and I bribed myself
into the US...

997
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,700
where I swore never
to lie or steal again.

998
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,240
You see, my friends,
because when people

999
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,660
trust you, they buy more.

1000
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:09,450
The Italians are cows.
The Spaniards, sheep.

1001
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,460
The Belgians...

1002
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,740
I come to my room,
which I share

1003
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,700
with the unhappy
English butler.

1004
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:20,220
A fish. He groans a lot.

1005
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,300
But I'm sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning.

1006
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,100
I should say...

1007
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,860
in case it is relevant...

1008
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,380
there was
an embarrassing moment.

1009
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,580
When I went to see
Mrs. Hubbard...

1010
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,620
first, I opened
the wrong door.

1011
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,100
Oh, sorry.

1012
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,410
What time was this?

1013
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,990
That must have been about...

1014
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,380
Don't be sorry.

1015
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,340
...twenty minutes to 11:00.

1016
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,180
This is interesting.

1017
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,490
As far as it is known,

1018
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,380
you are the last person
to see Ratchett alive.

1019
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,100
Your business?
Automobiles.

1020
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,660
I have three showrooms.

1021
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,940
I come to America
with nothing. And now...

1022
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,120
If what you say is true,

1023
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,200
Miss Debenham
will confirm it.

1024
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,140
But it is true.

1025
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:08,180
I would not lie.

1026
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,020
May it be possible
that Miss Debenham

1027
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,790
left your compartment
without you noticing?

1028
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:14,660
No. I sleep very lightly.

1029
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,860
The slightest sound
and I bolt upright.

1030
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,740
I was surprised once.

1031
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,300
Never again.

1032
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,380
No, I didn't say
I was a chauffeur.

1033
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:29,970
The photographs that
spilled out of your luggage...

1034
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,940
there was a beautiful one

1035
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,140
with a little boy
wearing a chauffeur's hat...

1036
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,700
visiting his papa at work.

1037
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,460
Who did you chauffeur?

1038
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,140
Miss Estravados,
why do your hands

1039
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,900
have the calluses
of a boxer?

1040
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,900
I do my work
in dangerous cities...

1041
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,980
where I cannot
be governed by fear.

1042
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,550
I trained to fight.

1043
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:50,300
But you do not trust
your god anymore...

1044
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,900
since your surprise?

1045
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,580
No, in case He is busy.

1046
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,820
God is always busy.

1047
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,940
It's Masterman.

1048
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,750
A man dying is a man
with nothing to lose.

1049
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,950
Bravo, Bouc. Except for
the problem of Mr. Marquez...

1050
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,030
who has now confirmed

1051
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,310
that his bunkmate,
Masterman...

1052
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:08,260
was reading in his bed
at the time of death.

1053
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,850
If it were easy, I would
not be famous. Next.

1054
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,470
Miss Debenham...

1055
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,260
you do not mind
to brace the air?

1056
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,980
For you, we have the picnic.

1057
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,740
While you made my roommate
suffer cramped quarters.

1058
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,890
I see.

1059
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,140
Choose the best location

1060
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,750
to extract the truth
from each suspect.

1061
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,860
Put her off-balance
and me, freeze.

1062
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,270
Clever.

1063
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,680
Will you write down
your full name

1064
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,380
and address, please?

1065
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,220
A pale mauve, by the way.

1066
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,700
Miss Estravados told me
you asked

1067
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,380
the color
of her dressing gown.

1068
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,580
Merci.

1069
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,050
"Mary Hermione Debenham."

1070
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,780
Do you ever go by Hermione?

1071
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,900
A constant Mary, when I'm not
employed as Miss Debenham.

1072
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,210
Left-handed.

1073
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,220
Unusual, I know.

1074
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,560
You mustn't have
your theory fixed

1075
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,260
if you're testing
my handwriting.

1076
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,420
What did you think
of the dead man?

1077
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,860
Uh, I can't say
I did think about him.

1078
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:11,960
I don't quite see
the point of your question.

1079
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:15,980
Oh, forgive me, mademoiselle,
my little originalities.

1080
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,900
Human nature is perverse
in its complexity.

1081
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:23,900
To plumb it,
it takes the right tools.

1082
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,780
These are toys,
not tools, Hercule.

1083
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,370
I prefer you put them away.

1084
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,220
The direct method? Parfait.

1085
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,620
You knew the doctor
before traveling?

1086
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:32,790
Dr. Arbuthnot?

1087
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,650
No.

1088
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,140
But such instant attraction?

1089
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,940
We are not in America...

1090
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,500
Miss Debenham.
There are no laws

1091
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,860
against what you may feel.

1092
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:55,340
Nor are there laws
against silence, of which...

1093
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:57,100
I hold my...

1094
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,740
I've never been to America.

1095
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:07,820
Perhaps I may ask
about some...

1096
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,180
words I overheard?

1097
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,180
You and the stranger,
Arbuthnot,

1098
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,340
are closer than strangers
might be.

1099
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,540
You said...

1100
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:19,980
"Not now. When we are done.
Then no one can touch us."

1101
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,780
What did you mean?

1102
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:25,940
You think I meant murder?

1103
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,900
To a man with a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

1104
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:30,740
You live crime.

1105
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:33,060
You see evil every day.
Not so.

1106
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,700
I see enough crime to know

1107
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,700
that the criminal act
is the anomaly.

1108
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:40,860
I believe it takes
a fracture of the soul...

1109
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,740
to murder another human being.

1110
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:49,100
I ask again,
what did you mean?

1111
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:53,300
As we established...

1112
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:56,340
there are no laws
against my silence.

1113
01:01:58,190 --> 01:01:59,700
Very well.

1114
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,260
And afterwards,
Princess Dragomiroff?

1115
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,810
After dinner, I came to bed.

1116
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,540
God blessed me with long life,

1117
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:22,020
but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable.

1118
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,270
About a quarter to 1:00...

1119
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,860
I called for
Fräulein Schmidt.

1120
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,460
Mmm-hmm.
She massaged me...

1121
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:29,890
and read to me
for a while.

1122
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,820
- Then I sleep.
- Mmm-hmm.

1123
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:33,570
Were you ever acquainted...

1124
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,140
with a family
by the name of Armstrong?

1125
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,980
They endured
an unspeakable tragedy.

1126
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:51,620
I was an admirer of
Sonia Armstrong's mother...

1127
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,940
Linda Arden, the actress.

1128
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:57,140
A once-a-century talent.

1129
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,300
Miss Arden was to
turn to directing.

1130
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,700
She would have
become the first

1131
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,130
woman titan of Broadway...

1132
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,220
were it not for the tragedy.

1133
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:12,010
And this Linda Arden,
she is dead?

1134
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,020
She might as well be.

1135
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,580
She no longer
leaves her home.

1136
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,700
Daisy was my goddaughter.

1137
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:24,740
She was a...

1138
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:38,460
I don't see how this relates
to our troubles, Detective.

1139
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:42,220
The man killed last night,
his true name was Cassetti.

1140
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:45,460
The man who murdered
little Daisy Armstrong.

1141
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:52,380
I see.

1142
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:55,820
I admit I know this family,
and now this man is dead.

1143
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,780
The coincidence...

1144
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,220
must seem unbearable.

1145
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:04,020
You may be permitted
a coincidence.

1146
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,940
I must now ask a few questions
of your Fräulein Schmidt.

1147
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,480
No. There is no need.

1148
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,020
I can answer
to her character.

1149
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,180
Even still, if you will allow.

1150
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,700
Fraulein. Answer please in German.

1151
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,780
But her Excellency cannot comprehend me.

1152
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,220
That is the point.

1153
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,500
This is yours? H for Hildegarde?

1154
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,460
It is too fine for me.

1155
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:37,260
This is the truth about last night?

1156
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:42,740
As she said. She sent the conductor for me,

1157
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,500
then I returned to bed.

1158
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:46,590
Did you see anyone when you returned?

1159
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,620
Only the other conductor.

1160
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,080
"The other conductor."

1161
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,110
You mean Michel?

1162
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:55,070
No. A different
one than had awoken me.

1163
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:56,870
Please come with me.

1164
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,510
Are you sure
you did not see him?

1165
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:01,640
I'm certain.
The other conductor

1166
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:02,880
was a small man
with a short beard.

1167
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:04,120
Fräulein, there is
no other conductor.

1168
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,150
I know what I saw.

1169
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,720
I remember because
his voice was high

1170
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,040
and the uniform
was the same exactly.

1171
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,740
Though, I suspect,
missing one button.

1172
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,500
Sir, I need your
passkey immediately.

1173
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:15,450
We need to find a uniform
and a red kimono.

1174
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:17,060
Thousands
of photographs,

1175
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,150
endless pairs of socks...

1176
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,140
dressing gowns
in every color but red...

1177
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,140
and still no contraband
conductor's uniform.

1178
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,740
Have we checked
all the passengers' luggage?

1179
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,180
All except
for the Count

1180
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:27,510
and Countess Andrenyi,
monsieur.

1181
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:29,620
It is forbidden
to search their suitcases.

1182
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,580
They travel
under diplomatic visas.

1183
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,620
Where else could it be?

1184
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:37,020
There is one last suitcase
we have not checked.

1185
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,310
My own.

1186
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,340
The killer
is mocking me.

1187
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,260
Good. His first mistake.

1188
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:51,460
And as the night
must follow the day...

1189
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,660
Pardon, mademoiselle.

1190
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,810
No, it's not mine.

1191
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,760
I told you of the conductor.
Why would I tell you

1192
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:02,950
if it was me?
You would not...

1193
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,270
which makes your compartment
the ideal choice to hide it.

1194
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,580
Voilà, the button.

1195
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,380
And if a conductor's
uniform...

1196
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:14,620
why not a conductor's passkey?

1197
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:16,060
Now we know how the killer

1198
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,610
magically passed through
locked doors.

1199
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:24,660
Bourbon.
MacQueen.

1200
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,920
Now what are we
looking for now?

1201
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,170
500 pounds.

1202
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:30,490
MacQueen also had a ledger.

1203
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:31,940
All his dealings
with Ratchett.

1204
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,980
Where is it, hmm?

1205
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:38,230
Poirot?

1206
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,900
Bouc, keep everyone inside!

1207
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,580
Monsieur!
Please stop!

1208
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:56,270
Monsieur!

1209
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,940
Monsieur!

1210
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,420
Please stay
where you are.

1211
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,300
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

1212
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:49,500
So, it was MacQueen?
You have your man?

1213
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:51,180
Pardonnez-moi, madame.

1214
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:53,260
How could he?

1215
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:54,550
I didn't kill him!

1216
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:55,840
You tried to burn
Ratchett's accounts...

1217
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,160
but they are still
legible in places.

1218
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:58,190
The maths do not tally...

1219
01:07:58,350 --> 01:07:59,940
because you have been
stealing from him.

1220
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,580
It is full of the...

1221
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:05,020
- What is the English word?
- The chocolat?

1222
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,220
Fudge?
Fudge!

1223
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,450
It is full of the fudge!

1224
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,500
You stole from him!

1225
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,220
You thought
you would be found out.

1226
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:13,540
That is why you killed him!

1227
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:14,710
Yeah.

1228
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:19,300
Yeah, you're damn right
I stole from him.

1229
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,740
Thousands.

1230
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:24,500
I knew his money
wasn't honest.

1231
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,900
What did it matter if I
skimmed some off the top?

1232
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:31,020
But let me ask you a question.

1233
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:34,940
Why would I slaughter
my cash cow?

1234
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,330
I didn't do it.

1235
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:38,230
- I didn't kill him!
- He didn't.

1236
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:40,090
He didn't.

1237
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,740
I expect his alibi
revolves around me,

1238
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:43,990
drinking till
the early hours.

1239
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,150
Well, it's true.

1240
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,020
I saw him having whiskey,
and remarked

1241
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,980
on the lesser quality
of American liquor.

1242
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,150
He offered me a tipple

1243
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,740
to change my mind,
then another.

1244
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:55,140
We got to arguing politics.
He had some...

1245
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,540
tomfool opinions on Stalin

1246
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:59,510
I had to correct. But the
man knows his spirits.

1247
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:05,500
A word, please, monsieur.

1248
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,540
You can confirm you were
with him all night?

1249
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,780
We smoked and spoke
till nearly 2:00, yes.

1250
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:11,880
Ah, such chums, him with
his cigarettes, and you...

1251
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:14,290
Yes, you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe.

1252
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,420
May I see your pipe
and your tobacco, please?

1253
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:17,590
Of course.

1254
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,750
And you, Dr. Arbuthnot,

1255
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:21,430
were traveling from India,
I believe. Yes?

1256
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,420
You're interviewing me now?
Mmm-hmm.

1257
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:24,760
Were you ever in
Ratchett's compartment

1258
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:26,500
before he was killed?
Certainly not.

1259
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,750
But this is one of your
pipe cleaners, n'est-ce pas?

1260
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:32,420
If you found that in the dead
man's cabin, look elsewhere.

1261
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,820
I am a doctor, sir.

1262
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,270
I heal people.
I do not hurt them.

1263
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,100
About this, see,
you must have worked

1264
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:38,620
very hard to
become a doctor.

1265
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:42,140
Not many of your race
are allowed the opportunity.

1266
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,220
Middlesex Medical College
permits one per class.

1267
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,380
I had the honor in '24.

1268
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,300
I was a sniper in my tour.

1269
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,060
A sharpshooter.

1270
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,660
Saved more than
a few officers.

1271
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,790
The more grateful,

1272
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,440
recognized a fair mind
with a steady hand...

1273
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,300
and supported my education.

1274
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:00,860
I take their generosity
as a debt.

1275
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,180
Did you know
a Colonel Armstrong?

1276
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:06,300
Might have known
two or three Armstrongs.

1277
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,140
Tommy in the 60th...
Selby Armstrong...

1278
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,660
No, I meant
Colonel John Armstrong.

1279
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,020
He had an American wife,

1280
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:14,300
and his child was
kidnapped and killed.

1281
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,650
Oh.

1282
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,680
Never came across the fellow.

1283
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,820
When did you first meet
Miss Debenham?

1284
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,820
We met when we shared
the railway convoy car

1285
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:23,050
from Kirkuk to Nissibin.

1286
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:24,290
She claims otherwise,

1287
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,500
and she has made herself
problematically suspicious.

1288
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:27,670
Excusez-moi.

1289
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,580
Mary is a lady.

1290
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,160
Leave her out of this.
I can vouch for her character.

1291
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:35,180
As you vouched
for MacQueen's time?

1292
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,220
You won't listen to reason.
Never.

1293
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,700
You are lucky.
The good doctor insists

1294
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,540
he did not let you
out of his sight.

1295
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,260
See? There.
Couldn't have done it.

1296
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:48,490
Yes, you could.

1297
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,510
Ratchett took a sleeping
draught each evening.

1298
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:53,500
You could add barbital,
easily access that drug.

1299
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,710
Do the same with one
of the doctor's many drinks...

1300
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,150
and the chance
to kill him is clear.

1301
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,350
Why would I do any of that?

1302
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:59,680
We have established
your motive.

1303
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,700
Perhaps I will
suggest a different one.

1304
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:06,260
A different reason,
a more personal reason.

1305
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:09,260
"A lawyer by education,
not by disposition."

1306
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:12,420
Why did you pursue
the law, I wonder?

1307
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:17,100
Was it to appease
a much loved,

1308
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,500
but demanding father...

1309
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,660
one who himself had made
a great success

1310
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,100
in the same field...

1311
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:30,260
and then lost his position?

1312
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:34,500
There was a renowned
MacQueen, was there not?

1313
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:38,250
The district attorney for
the state of New Jersey...

1314
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,420
responsible
for the prosecution

1315
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,700
of the Armstrong case.

1316
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,010
They didn't have a suspect.

1317
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:52,940
My dad was pressured
to go after

1318
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,900
this poor French woman...

1319
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:59,100
a maid with a weak alibi,
Susanne.

1320
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:03,100
He hung his
whole case on her.

1321
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:07,220
She killed herself.

1322
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:10,060
She was innocent.

1323
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,420
By the time the evidence
lead to Cassetti,

1324
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:15,820
oh, he was long gone.

1325
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:19,780
They tore my old man apart.

1326
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:24,260
I couldn't do anything
for him.

1327
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:25,690
And yet you claim

1328
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,780
that you did not know
Ratchett was Cassetti?

1329
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:29,580
No, no.

1330
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:30,940
But you found him.

1331
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,070
No.

1332
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,110
You found him.

1333
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,270
You bled him dry...
No.

1334
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,700
in order to settle
your father's debts,

1335
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,900
and then finally,
to settle the score.

1336
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:40,420
No, no, no.

1337
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,500
No. It wasn't...

1338
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,540
It wasn't like that.
It's not the way...

1339
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:50,110
Someone kicked in the door...

1340
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,260
Doctor!

1341
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,980
covered my face.

1342
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,660
All right, this needs
to come out now.

1343
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,300
I want my bag.
Of course.

1344
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,650
It's in my compartment.

1345
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,750
There will be no fingerprints.

1346
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,630
The killer was disposing
of the murder weapon.

1347
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,500
It'sthere!

1348
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,140
The killer didn't hit
a lung or artery.

1349
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,740
She's lucky to be alive.

1350
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:26,300
You all are.

1351
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:27,470
Yeah, some genius!

1352
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:30,090
Why haven't you
solved this case?

1353
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,460
You must give the man
some time.

1354
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:33,820
Yeah, well...

1355
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:36,860
I can't give that much more.
I don't have any blood left.

1356
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,030
Yeah.

1357
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,410
Accosting Mr. MacQueen,

1358
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,020
and the real killer
is right here.

1359
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,020
One of you people.

1360
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:47,870
I don't know who you are.
I said nothing.

1361
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,460
Please, leave me alone.

1362
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,070
Play something.

1363
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,180
My friends, the tracks will be
cleared by morning.

1364
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:54,940
Please, return to your rooms.

1365
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,110
I'm sleeping here...

1366
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,500
where everyone can see me
and I can see everyone.

1367
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,360
You should all do
the same. Conserve heat.

1368
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:03,140
Remain in the open,
safely in view, until morning.

1369
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,990
A killer will never
hesitate to kill again.

1370
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:11,500
I will convey the same message
to the Andrenyis...

1371
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,220
diplomatic immunity or not.

1372
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,630
If I may,
I will look at your passports.

1373
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:27,550
You know that
I must talk with her.

1374
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,200
By the way, there is a grease
spot on your wife's name.

1375
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:31,400
You might want
to look at that.

1376
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,900
Elena is not well.

1377
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,560
If you do not permit me,
your reluctance

1378
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:36,760
will be noted
to the Yugoslav Police...

1379
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:38,240
and I have no doubt that they
will arrest both you and...

1380
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:39,280
How dare you!

1381
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,700
Darling!

1382
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,140
Darling.

1383
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:52,260
You are funny-looking,
monsieur Poirot.

1384
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,780
Are all detectives
so funny-looking?

1385
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,700
I am sorry to wake you,
Madame la Comtesse.

1386
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:02,220
Hmm.

1387
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,260
I am always awake at night.

1388
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:06,300
In the day, I sleep.

1389
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:10,620
Some fear darkness,
but I cannot stand the light.

1390
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,740
You are always
under the influence of...

1391
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:14,750
Barbital.

1392
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,500
Barbital, barbital.

1393
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,580
I take oceans of it.

1394
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,420
Oh, there's no use
in a lie, love.

1395
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,620
He can see right through us.

1396
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,970
I cannot go outside
without it.

1397
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,300
I cannot sleep without it.

1398
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,980
I take it against my fears.

1399
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:44,790
What are you afraid of?

1400
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,530
Everything.

1401
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:58,940
Your passport has your
maiden name as Goldenberg.

1402
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,460
Jewish, yes?

1403
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,190
Not so Jewish.
My middle name isn't Maria.

1404
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,020
And you are a dancer
like your husband?

1405
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,140
No, not like my husband.

1406
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:09,340
Corps de ballet.

1407
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:10,620
He is touched by angels.

1408
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,660
I have been
shoved by passion

1409
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:15,420
and hard work to become adequate.

1410
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,900
Excuse me,
I must lie down again.

1411
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,030
Is this your only
dressing gown?

1412
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:31,860
No, I have another.
Corn-colored chiffon.

1413
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,660
I like speaking
to detectives.

1414
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:37,020
You never know what they're
going to ask you next.

1415
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,310
I'm particularly good
at capitals.

1416
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,260
My governess was a stickler
for geography.

1417
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:45,900
Are you satisfied?

1418
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:50,220
I am always satisfied
when I uncover a liar.

1419
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:54,010
Madame, your name is
not Elena. It is Helena.

1420
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,310
Despite your clumsy attempts

1421
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,540
to change it here
and on your luggage.

1422
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:00,480
My husband heard

1423
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,020
of a piece of evidence
found...

1424
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:03,780
a handkerchief embroidered
with an "H,"

1425
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:06,210
and didn't want
my "H" involved.

1426
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,860
So we changed it.
The luggage and the passport.

1427
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,330
It's no crime to want to
be distant from trouble.

1428
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:14,220
Yet, here is trouble.

1429
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,650
A curious detail

1430
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,210
about the Armstrong tragedy
at the heart of this case...

1431
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:21,940
is how many people
were wounded by it.

1432
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,900
The younger sister.

1433
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:25,940
The actress mother...

1434
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,380
stage name, Linda Arden.

1435
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:33,250
I suppose she, too,
was of Jewish ancestry...

1436
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:36,940
as who is most likely
to take a stage name?

1437
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,060
Is it too far to suggest...

1438
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:43,220
her original name
was Goldenberg?

1439
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:47,380
Especially when we find
a young woman,

1440
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:48,940
the same age...

1441
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:51,900
as her surviving daughter...

1442
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,300
living in a world of fear?

1443
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:58,100
The sister of
Sonia Armstrong.

1444
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,140
Get out!

1445
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:09,260
I hear noises and I run.
Just in time, yes?

1446
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,340
You must now believe the count
and countess are the killers.

1447
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,470
The count is protective.

1448
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,280
The countess would no sooner
kill a bedroom spider.

1449
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:17,500
And you may desist
with this charade.

1450
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:22,580
You are neither an Austrian,
nor a German, nor a professor.

1451
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:25,020
But a good imitation.

1452
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,300
Was it based on
someone you know?

1453
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:36,580
A local butcher where
I grew up was a Kraut.

1454
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,580
Good man, great accent.

1455
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:44,500
What was it?

1456
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:46,380
You said "Tur-in..."

1457
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:48,380
the emphasis
on the wrong syllable

1458
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,180
for a proud and proper Teuton.

1459
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,340
"Tu-reen."

1460
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:59,940
You are one sharp knife,
I give you that.

1461
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:08,180
Herr Professor
Gerhard Hardman...

1462
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:10,260
is my cover.

1463
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,860
I'm sorry about
the colored folks cracks.

1464
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:16,020
Hell, I'm half a Heeb myself.

1465
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,180
Cyrus Bethman Hardman.

1466
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,380
You are a Pinkerton detective?

1467
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,460
30 years.

1468
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:26,540
I was in Stamboul,
coming back from a job,

1469
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,660
when the office cabled.

1470
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,420
Ratchett asked for a man
to tail him,

1471
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:31,690
offering triple time.

1472
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,860
Lucky me being nearby.

1473
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:41,460
He told me to look out

1474
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,260
for a small, dark man
with a high voice.

1475
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:46,420
I watched that hall...

1476
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:49,460
all night through
a crack in my door.

1477
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,740
Any thug...

1478
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,260
had to go by me first.

1479
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:55,940
I'll take my oath on it.

1480
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:58,300
And would you
also take your oath...

1481
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,070
on your thirty years
as a Pinkerton Detective...

1482
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:02,780
or would you
lie to me again...

1483
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:06,460
and deny that you were,
in fact, a policeman first?

1484
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:10,060
Your gun, the checkered grip,
the blue finish...

1485
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:13,300
produced for
the Police Positive edition.

1486
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:16,100
1927 issue.

1487
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,790
It appears there are
no end to the lies

1488
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,500
manufactured just for me.

1489
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:24,100
You can leave your gun
as you go, Professor.

1490
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,940
From the position
of his cabin...

1491
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:52,020
it would have been
impossible to miss.

1492
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:57,860
Unless Ratchett's
door was open...

1493
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:01,980
as Pilar Estravados
claims she opened it.

1494
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:05,460
In which case,
someone could have been...

1495
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:08,010
masked from his view.

1496
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,300
My darling Katherine.

1497
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:19,660
This is an abominable crime...

1498
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:22,980
and I am stuck, ma Katherine.

1499
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:28,660
I cannot find
the crack in the wall.

1500
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:32,860
Why does one of them elude me?

1501
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,580
I have always been...

1502
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:42,180
so sure.

1503
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:45,260
Too sure.

1504
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,060
But now, I am very humble.

1505
01:21:49,190 --> 01:21:51,650
And I say,
like a little child...

1506
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:56,180
I do not know.

1507
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:01,860
I am afraid, ma Katherine.

1508
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,040
My apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.

1509
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,290
It is not safe on board

1510
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:22,110
whilst the engine
is put back on the tracks.

1511
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:23,710
We are to wait in the tunnel.
Thank you.

1512
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,120
Where
are they taking the dogs?

1513
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:26,480
They'll be happy.

1514
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,570
That's not right.

1515
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:29,150
Just to stretch
their legs, it's good.

1516
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:31,100
No, that's not right.

1517
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,570
It's freezing!

1518
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,220
Are we stuck?

1519
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:38,460
You asked for me?

1520
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,780
Another interrogation?

1521
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:42,380
Oh, no. I enjoy your company.

1522
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,860
Merci, Bouc.

1523
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,140
Uh, please.

1524
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:49,380
I have a list of ten questions
I am no nearer to answering...

1525
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,460
and the train
is about to leave.

1526
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,820
You have a clear mind...

1527
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:57,740
and I thought that you might
produce an insight. Please.

1528
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:00,740
Hmm.

1529
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,380
"The handkerchief.
The pipe cleaner.

1530
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:09,220
"The scarlet kimono.
The uniform.

1531
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,580
"The time on the watch.

1532
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:15,580
"Was he murdered then?
Earlier or later?

1533
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,170
"By one person or more?

1534
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:20,060
"Which of them?"

1535
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,820
Sorry, I can't help you.

1536
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:27,420
Uh... Merci.

1537
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:30,560
Perhaps there is
an eleventh question

1538
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:31,900
you don't know to ask yet...

1539
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,260
that will give you
the answer to the rest.

1540
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:35,740
Perhaps.

1541
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:40,860
I could point an easy finger
at the, uh, Countess Andrenyi.

1542
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,460
I discovered she was
Sonia Armstrong's sister.

1543
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:44,980
Are you certain?
Yes.

1544
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,820
I suspect she may
perhaps be innocent.

1545
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,380
Perhaps.

1546
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:49,940
But so many people
have lied to me

1547
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,320
on this train
and do not seem to mind.

1548
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:52,700
You yourself did
so effortlessly.

1549
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:53,790
Me?

1550
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,660
You told me you had
never been to America.

1551
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,060
You also concealed the fact

1552
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,320
that at the time
of the tragedy...

1553
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:00,380
you were living
in the Armstrong household...

1554
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:01,940
as governess
to their daughter.

1555
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:03,090
And you know this.

1556
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:05,140
I have my living to get.

1557
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:07,230
A girl detained in connection
to a murder case...

1558
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,940
no decent class family
would engage me.

1559
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,820
Miss Debenham,
you planned Ratchett's murder.

1560
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:14,060
And then you sent for
the countess to witness it.

1561
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:15,700
If she saw him dead,

1562
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,300
the Helena you knew
might return.

1563
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:19,630
You waited for your roommate
to sleep, but she did not.

1564
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,750
You drugged her.

1565
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:22,200
But the barbital only
gave her a headache.

1566
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:23,560
She begged for an aspirin
when the train stopped,

1567
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,150
when the conductor was
on the station...

1568
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:26,360
when the coast
was clear at last...

1569
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:27,480
when you were allowed to enter

1570
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:28,710
Ratchett's compartment,
unseen.

1571
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:31,020
You loved Daisy Armstrong.
You killed Cassetti.

1572
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:36,700
Cassetti was a pig.

1573
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:38,620
He deserved to die.

1574
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,060
She didn't kill him.

1575
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,900
I did.

1576
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:58,940
Mary, go.

1577
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,620
I can't let you
take the blame...

1578
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:03,220
for what I did alone.

1579
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,420
Mary, please, go.

1580
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:15,500
John Armstrong
was my best friend,

1581
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:17,260
my commander.

1582
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:20,980
He believed in me.

1583
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:25,140
He sent me to medical school,
gave me a future.

1584
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,650
Cassetti destroyed him.

1585
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:33,020
In grief, I found Mary.

1586
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:36,660
Then I found Ratchett.

1587
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,540
Our plan was to reveal him
to the police,

1588
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,740
that's what you heard.

1589
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,340
But when I saw his face...

1590
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,500
I knew he didn't
deserve a trial.

1591
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:54,220
So, you drugged MacQueen.

1592
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:56,460
You changed the time
on the watch...

1593
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:59,580
so that you could lie
about the time of death.

1594
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,180
I couldn't let Mary
be accused.

1595
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,620
Or MacQueen.

1596
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:08,500
My sins are mine
to pay for, alone.

1597
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,820
I'm a soldier.

1598
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,540
A soldier kills to protect.

1599
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:14,940
And now, Mr. Poirot,

1600
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:16,500
I must protect myself
from you.

1601
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,740
Why aren't you dead yet?

1602
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:36,540
Poirot?

1603
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,820
Gentlemen, stop!

1604
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,260
Sir, we need to get
all the passengers

1605
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:56,820
back on the train.

1606
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:00,220
You will retire...

1607
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,460
away from the train...

1608
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,860
until I tell you to return.

1609
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:26,940
You tell your lies...

1610
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,940
and you think
no one will know.

1611
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:33,170
But there are two people
who will know.

1612
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:35,460
Yes, two people.

1613
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:37,820
Your God...

1614
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:41,380
and Hercule Poirot.

1615
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,380
It is time to solve this case.

1616
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:13,340
Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I was not yet dead.

1617
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:16,820
He knew, of course,
the answer.

1618
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:20,060
A sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range?

1619
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:25,020
Your shot was not a mistake.
It was a surgery.

1620
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:28,460
You could not kill me
because you are no killer.

1621
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,060
None of you are killers.

1622
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,540
And yet, someone must be.

1623
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:40,860
There are two possible
solutions to this crime.

1624
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:43,960
One difficult,
because it fits with most

1625
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:45,130
but not all of the facts...

1626
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:47,060
and one more...

1627
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,900
complex.

1628
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,860
The first solution.

1629
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:53,740
Ratchett had enemies.

1630
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:56,860
A rogue Mafioso steals
onto the train at Vinkovci...

1631
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:59,250
as MacQueen
and Arbuthnot take the air.

1632
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:00,780
Equipped with a uniform

1633
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,460
and a passkey,
he stabs Ratchett.

1634
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,580
He leaves through
Mrs. Hubbard's compartment,

1635
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:05,810
and makes his escape.

1636
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:07,110
No.

1637
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,660
No, no, no. It doesn't work.

1638
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:13,260
Why hide the uniform, hmm?

1639
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:15,340
Who drugs Ratchett?

1640
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:17,540
Or stabs Mrs. Hubbard?

1641
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:19,660
Damn it, man!

1642
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:23,460
So I ask,
who stands to benefit?

1643
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:27,740
This crime is the murdering
of a murderer.

1644
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,660
The benefit is, perhaps...

1645
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:34,580
to the spirit,
an ease of suffering.

1646
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,970
To quiet a shouting voice

1647
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:40,220
in the head
that prevents sleep.

1648
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:49,050
There is a murderer among us.

1649
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,510
So...

1650
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:54,090
We have Dr. Arbuthnot,

1651
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:56,610
a dedicated, grateful friend
to Colonel Armstrong.

1652
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:59,340
He meets and finds solace

1653
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:01,350
in the company of the
governess, Mary Debenham...

1654
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:04,100
who is almost like a mother
to the little girl.

1655
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:09,020
And so close to
Mrs. Armstrong's young sister,

1656
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:11,100
Helena Goldenberg...

1657
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:13,730
married to a powerful man

1658
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:16,100
no stranger
to rage and violence.

1659
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:20,300
We travel also
with Daisy's godmother...

1660
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:23,300
to whom belongs...

1661
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:25,340
the monogrammed handkerchief

1662
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,660
found at the scene
of the crime.

1663
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:31,860
The letter "H"
in the Russian alphabet,

1664
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,510
of course, pronounced "N."

1665
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,860
Natalia Dragomiroff.

1666
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,660
And her devoted maid
with a chef's eye?

1667
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,310
Who was she before
her current employ?

1668
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,500
Might I suggest
the Armstrongs' cook?

1669
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:48,580
But we are not yet done.

1670
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,860
The nurse
in charge of Daisy...

1671
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,620
her newfound religious zeal

1672
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:54,340
born of guilt
at allowing her charge...

1673
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:56,460
to be abducted.
It was you, was it not...

1674
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,690
in her room the night when

1675
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,380
Ratchett came in
through the window?

1676
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,460
Did you have
a glass of wine too many

1677
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,710
with your supper that night?

1678
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,580
Have you blamed yourself
ever since...

1679
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,300
for not being alert
to stop him?

1680
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:10,220
She knew nothing
but kindness...

1681
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,540
and love, until...

1682
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:18,300
until I...

1683
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:21,020
No need
to divine with me, sir.

1684
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:25,100
I was Colonel Armstrong's
batman in the war.

1685
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:29,220
And afterwards,
his valet in New York.

1686
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:33,180
As fine a man
as God ever made.

1687
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,380
Would his chauffeur agree?

1688
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:37,500
Was it a bank loan,
secured by Armstrong,

1689
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:39,260
allows him to build
his automobile empire?

1690
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:42,020
He's indebted for life.
Who else can we count?

1691
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:43,740
What of
the Pinkerton detective,

1692
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,020
once a police officer...

1693
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,380
assigned to
the Armstrong case?

1694
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:49,860
And he becomes attached
to someone,

1695
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:52,820
for there is another,
uncelebrated victim.

1696
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:54,660
You fell in love with the maid

1697
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:56,820
before she was
falsely accused.

1698
01:31:56,990 --> 01:31:58,590
You quit the police
when you witnessed...

1699
01:31:58,670 --> 01:32:00,700
the travesty ofjustice...

1700
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:03,780
when MacQueen's father
insisted on her arrest.

1701
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:06,300
When she took her own life.

1702
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:08,580
No! No, no!

1703
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:12,780
Susanne was so gentle.

1704
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:15,060
And she fell for me.

1705
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:17,780
Old and already getting grey.

1706
01:32:17,870 --> 01:32:19,820
I told her
she could do better...

1707
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,620
but there she was...

1708
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:27,460
on time for every date.

1709
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:29,930
Why else is a train...

1710
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:33,380
so full in the dead of winter?
Why the inconsistent wounds?

1711
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,660
Why the abundance
of evidence? Why...?

1712
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:40,460
Why the conductor?

1713
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:43,180
Pierre Michel of Avignon...

1714
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:47,340
who lost his sister...

1715
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,100
the accused maid...

1716
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:53,130
Susanne Michel.

1717
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,140
Only one soul can
claim to have lost

1718
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:02,140
more than any of you.

1719
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,180
The tragic Linda Arden...

1720
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,420
mother of Sonia...

1721
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,820
grandmother of Daisy.

1722
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:12,140
Retired from the stage...

1723
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:16,220
but for one final performance.

1724
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:40,220
You're an awfully clever man.

1725
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:46,420
A murder should
have one victim.

1726
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:49,620
When Ratchett kills
Daisy Armstrong...

1727
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:54,910
a dozen lives are broken,
deformed, ended.

1728
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:57,700
They demand justice!

1729
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:01,780
Of all these wounded souls,
we must finally answer...

1730
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:04,940
who among them is a killer?

1731
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:08,940
Who takes up the knife?
The answer is...

1732
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:17,380
No single one of you
could have done it.

1733
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:19,540
Nor any pair.

1734
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,550
It can only have been done...

1735
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:24,940
by all of you.

1736
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:27,100
Together.

1737
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:31,580
Together.

1738
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:34,980
Even when the avalanche
changes everything...

1739
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:38,900
as does the detective,
plans must change.

1740
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:41,630
The kimono, the uniform.

1741
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:43,010
A remarkable improvisation,

1742
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:45,140
the doctor who knows how to
wound without killing.

1743
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:47,300
Each has their part to play.

1744
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:48,940
Do it.

1745
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:50,900
It was my plan.

1746
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:54,180
I recruited them.

1747
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:57,220
I had Hardman
track down Cassetti.

1748
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,020
I sent MacQueen
to work for him,

1749
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,780
and then Masterman.

1750
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:03,310
MacQueen could arrange

1751
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:05,300
he travel on the day
that Michel was on duty.

1752
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:48,150
Mr. Ratchett?

1753
01:36:51,710 --> 01:36:52,980
It's nothing.

1754
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,300
Bien, monsieur.
Good night.

1755
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,260
And so it is done.

1756
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:01,740
For the death of the innocent.

1757
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:04,740
A life for a life.

1758
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:08,420
Revenge.

1759
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:11,940
No one should
hang for this but me.

1760
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:14,490
It was my plan!

1761
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:18,700
Tell the police
it was me, alone.

1762
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:21,860
There's no life
left in me anymore.

1763
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:25,020
They have a chance now.

1764
01:37:25,190 --> 01:37:26,620
Helena, I pray...

1765
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:31,460
has a chance.

1766
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:33,340
They can...

1767
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:36,460
go live...

1768
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,940
find some joy...

1769
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:40,620
somewhere.

1770
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:44,980
Let it end with me.

1771
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,260
They're not killers.

1772
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,130
They're good people.

1773
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:57,660
They can be good again.

1774
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:04,980
There was right,
there was wrong.

1775
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:07,460
Now there is you.

1776
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:13,660
I cannot judge this.

1777
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:16,700
You must decide.

1778
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:19,310
You wish to go free

1779
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:20,790
without punishment
for your crime...

1780
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:25,050
then you must only
commit one more.

1781
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,140
I will not stop you.

1782
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:34,020
You can't let them kill you.

1783
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:36,970
You give my body
to the lake,

1784
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:39,820
and you walk away innocent
at the station.

1785
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,380
You must silence me.

1786
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:44,700
Bouc can lie.

1787
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:47,020
I cannot.

1788
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:54,690
Do it! One of you!

1789
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,660
Don't.

1790
01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:59,980
I already died with Daisy.

1791
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:02,350
No!

1792
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,380
You said your role
was to find justice.

1793
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:50,930
What is justice here?

1794
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:56,260
Sometimes, the law of man
is not enough.

1795
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,260
Where does conscience lie?

1796
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,580
Buried with Daisy.

1797
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:35,940
My dear
Colonel Armstrong.

1798
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:40,100
Finally, I can answer
your letter...

1799
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:43,300
at least with the thoughts
in my head

1800
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:45,810
and the feeling in my heart...

1801
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:49,420
that somewhere,
you can hear me.

1802
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:51,900
I have now discovered

1803
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:54,550
the truth of the case,
and it is...

1804
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,340
profoundly disturbing.

1805
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:01,860
I have seen the fracture
of the human soul.

1806
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:07,330
So many broken lives,
so much pain and anger...

1807
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:11,460
giving way to the poison
of deep grief...

1808
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:15,060
until one crime became many.

1809
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:18,740
I have always wanted
to believe

1810
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:22,530
that man is rational
and civilized.

1811
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:26,140
My very existence depends
upon this hope...

1812
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:31,660
upon order and method
and the little gray cells.

1813
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:35,980
But now, perhaps,
I am asked...

1814
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:38,660
to listen, instead...

1815
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,700
to my heart.

1816
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:49,340
Ladies and gentlemen...

1817
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:55,100
I have understood in this case
that the scales of justice...

1818
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:58,020
cannot always be
evenly weighed.

1819
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:01,570
And I must learn, for once...

1820
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:04,900
to live with the imbalance.

1821
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:08,900
There are no killers here.

1822
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:12,420
Only people who deserve
a chance to heal.

1823
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:14,740
The police have accepted

1824
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:16,260
my first solution
to the crime...

1825
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:19,540
the lone assassin
who made his escape.

1826
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:24,050
I will leave the train here
to conclude formalities.

1827
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,180
You are all free to go.

1828
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:31,380
And may you find
your peace with this.

1829
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:35,540
May we all.

1830
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:52,230
Hello.

1831
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:55,460
I'm looking for
a Mr. Poirot.

1832
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:57,300
He's needed
on a very urgent matter.

1833
01:44:57,390 --> 01:45:00,420
Ah. He is on holiday.

1834
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:04,900
The, uh, Kassner case again?

1835
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:07,530
No, sir, far worse.

1836
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:09,580
I have to take him
to Egypt straight away.

1837
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:13,420
There's been a murder, sir,
right on the bloody Nile.

1838
01:45:16,270 --> 01:45:18,140
Are you the detective?

1839
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:20,850
Yes.

1840
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:25,220
I am the detective.

1841
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:28,100
Could you please
straighten your tie?

1842
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:33,220
I will see you at the car.

1843
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:31,500
Here you are, sir.

1844
01:46:32,910 --> 01:46:33,970
Merci.

1845
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:35,290
Allons-y.
