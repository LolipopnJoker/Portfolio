MAC: OKAY, IT'S HAPPENING.

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,721
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

WE'RE HAVING SEX

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,091
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

WHO KNOWS WHAT WE'LL BE

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,808
OKAY.
THIS IS CRAZY!

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,921
WE'RE DOING THIS ON
THE DINING ROOM...

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,764
I'VE NEVER HAD SEX ON A DINING

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,291
(MOANING)
THIS IS AMAZING.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,566
I'M TAKING YOU TO
BONER TOWN, BITCH.

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,563
DON'T CALL ME "BITCH!"
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,762
SHE TOTALLY KNOWS
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,763
(LAUGHS) SHE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
SHE JUST SEES SHAPES.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,684
SHE SEES SHAPES FUCKING EACH OTHER,

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,569
SHE'S FINE.
SHE JUST SEES SHAPES.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,641
IT'S LIKE BOUNCING BALLS.

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,127
WHY IS SHE... OKAY.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,611
I THINK IT'S OVER.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,681
WE STILL DID THAT.

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,525
OH, I'M SORRY.
OKAY. WE STILL DID THAT.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,489
HELLO.

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,607
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN YOUR JUMPEROO?

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,801
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,644
WE'RE GONNA FINISH THAT.
WE WILL FINISH THAT.

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,484
FYI, WE'RE GONNA
DO IT IN EVERY ROOM.

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,483
AND THIS TIME,
I'M GOING TO EJACULATE.

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,210
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE
A HOUSE AND A BABY

55
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,845
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WE'RE OLD PEOPLE.

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,325
NO. FUCK OLD PEOPLE.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,004
OLD PEOPLE DON'T
FUCK LIKE WE JUST DID.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,650

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,165
THIS IS LIKE
THE <I>BRADY</I> BUNCH.

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,402
I KNOW! WHAT'S
NICE ABOUT THE HOUSE

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,484
IS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE EVERY
PENNY WE HAVE IS INSIDE OF IT.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,891
SO, AT LEAST

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,331

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,925

YOU GUYS ARE

103
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,247

00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,890
JIMMY: YEAH. WE'RE PRETTY
DEEP INTO IT. IT'S TIGHT.

106
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,649
PRETTY FAT FILE.
IT'S DANK.

107
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,921

IT'S NICE.

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,566
I THINK I REALIZED FOR THE FIRST
SIX MONTHS, EVERYTHING IS FUCKED.

114
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,005
EVERYTHING CHANGES COMPLETELY.
YEAH.

115
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,731
YOU'RE LIKE, "MY LIFE IS OVER!
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT!

116
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,325
"EVERYTHING I COULD DO,
I CAN'T DO ANYMORE."

117
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,290
BUT NOW, I REALIZE THAT THAT'S
ALL GONNA GO BACK TO NORMAL.

118
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,283
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
SHE CAN START DRINKING SOON.

119
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,091
THEY MAKE THESE LITTLE STRIPS THAT
TEST YOUR TIT MILK FOR ALCOHOL.

120
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,446
SHE PUTS THEM ON HER TITS?

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,003
SHE WON'T EVEN LET ME SEE

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,081
WHAT?
WHEN WE HAVE SEX,

125
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,605
SHE LEAVES A WIFE-BEATER ON.

126
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,409
IT'S LIKE HAVING SEX
WITH TONY SOPRANO.

127
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,481

(IMITATING BALE AS BATMAN)
"WHERE IS SHE?"

541
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,441

546
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,484
"NO, I'M COUNTING ON IT.
I'M BATMAN."

547
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,648
WE ACTUALLY MET
IN COLLEGE. YEAH.

548
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,846
GIRLS: AW!

549
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,241

AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM.

550
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,330

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,606
DUDE, WE ARE
ALMOST ROOMMATES.

555
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,250
OUR ROOMS ARE, LIKE, 10
FEET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

556
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,481
DUDE, WE CAN HAVE
WALKIE-TALKIES,

557
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,686
ACTUALLY.
(GASPS)

558
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,125
IT WOULD JUST WORK ALL THE TIME.
IT WOULD BE AWESOME.

559
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,680
LET'S GET WALKIE-TALKIES AND

560
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,484
WALKIE-TALKIES AND EARPIECES AND SHIT.
OH, MY GOD.

561
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,607

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,323
IT'S A REALLY ROMANTIC STORY.

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,802
HOLD ON TO THIS MOMENT, MAN.
SERIOUSLY, ENJOY THIS.

WE'RE NOT GONNA
GET CAUGHT FOR THIS.

636
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,444

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,409
WATKINS: WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
GUYS WERE PARTYING WITH HIM.

677
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,721
YOU PARTY PRETTY HEAVY.

678
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,127
THAT'S A JOKE PHOTO!

679
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,326
IT'S A JOKE?
THAT'S A JOKE!

680
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,606
IT'S NOT A GOOD JOKE.

681
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,920
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S END THIS.

682
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,968
I'M SORRY.
I RESCIND THE COMPLAINT.

683
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,088
YOU CAN GO.
NO NOISE COMPLAINT.

684
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,844
YOU KNOW THE BOY
WHO CRIED WOLF?

685
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,326
YOU'RE THAT BOY.

686
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,482
OKAY, I CRIED WOLF.
NEVER CALL US AGAIN.

687
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,608
NEVER CALL YOU AGAIN?
YOU'RE THE FUCKING POLICE.

688
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,521
LOOK, MAN, WE'RE SORRY.

689
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,681
YOU WERE BEING NOISY.

690
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,250
WE TRIED TO CALL YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

691
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,004
WE CALLED YOU FIVE TIMES,
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER US.

692
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,684
YOU MADE A PROMISE
TO ME LAST NIGHT.

693
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,081
WE WERE PISSING.
WE CROSSED STREAMS.

694
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,685
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

695
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,127
"HEY, I'M BATMAN."
YOU KNOW? RIGHT?

696
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,446
NO, WE'RE DONE
WITH THAT, BRO.

697
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,289
WE'RE STILL COOL, MAN. WE'RE STILL COOL.
WE'RE SORRY.

698
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,124
I'M NOT MAD.

699
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,123
I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED.

700
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,248
HEY, COME ON.
WAIT, LET'S JUST...

701
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,801
MAC: WHAT'S THAT?

702
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,641
THOSE ARE FOR YOU.

703
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,246
WHAT THE FUCK?

704
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,920
OH.

705
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,529
TEDDY: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
CALLED THE COPS, BRO!

706
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,926
OKAY.

707
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,649
(ALL SHOUTING)
OKAY, VERY GOOD.

708
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,721
VERY GOOD.

709
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,484
KELLY: OKAY.
CONGRATULATIONS.

710
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,085
YOU BETTER PUT THAT
IN THE RECYCLING BIN.

711
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,161
ALL OF IT.
ALL OF IT.

712
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,484
PETE: IT'S LIKE EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.
DO YOU LIKE IT?

713
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,130
IT'S A REALLY
EXPENSIVE BUSH!

714
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,561
I'M SORRY, I FELT INSPIRATION.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

715
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,643
I'M ABOUT TO RIP THIS
SHIT OUT OF THE GROUND.

716
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,166
(GRUNTING)

717
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,765
FUCK THIS BUSH!
FUCK THAT BUSH, MAN!

718
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,410
FUCK THIS BUSH!
FUCK THAT BUSH!

719
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,688
HARDER, MAN. YEAH,
REALLY GET IN THERE.

720
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,171
OH! OH!
GOD DAMN IT! KELLY!

721
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,005
WHOA. HEY, MAN,
BUY HIM DINNER FIRST.

722
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,121
FUCK THIS BUSH!

723
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,606
(GROANS)

724
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,727
ALL: OH!
SHIT!

725
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,365
OKAY. HA-HA.

726
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,363
SORRY, MAN. SORRY MY BALL
JUST GOT IN YOUR FACE.

727
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,366
(BOTH MOANING)

728
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,163
I LOVE YOU.
BABY.

729
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,006
OH, GOD.

730
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,605
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

731
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,011
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING.

732
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,366
(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

733
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,289
WHAT THE FUCK?
OH, MY GOD!

734
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,090
OH, NO! OH, NO!

735
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,089
WE CAN'T BE THE ONLY PEOPLE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

736
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,281
WHO ARE SICK OF
THIS BULLSHIT, YOU KNOW.

737
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,771
WE'VE GOTTA GET
EVERYONE ON OUR SIDE.

738
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,126
WE COULD LEAD A REVOLUTION.

739
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,201
OH, NO.

740
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,047
THEY'RE BUYING OFF THE WHOLE
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THEIR SLAVE ARMY.

741
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,483
OH! MRS. HAYWOOD,
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

742
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,290
I CAN'T SELL YOUR HOUSE.

743
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,527
WHY?
WELL,

744
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,722
BECAUSE THE ONLY
PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT

745
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,842
TO LIVE NEXT TO A FRAT
HOUSE IS A FRAT HOUSE.

746
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,889
OH, THE UNIVERSITY
MIGHT BE INTERESTED.

747
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,804
I KNOW THE SPANISH DEPARTMENT
IS LOOKING FOR A NEW BUILDING.

748
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,564
ONLY THING, IF YOU
SELL TO THE UNIVERSITY,

749
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,086
I'D SAY, OPTIMISTICALLY,
YOU'RE LOOKING

750
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,726
AT LOSING ABOUT
HALF YOUR INVESTMENT.

751
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,326
MAC: HALF OF ALL OF OUR...

752
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,845
WE PUT ALL OF OUR MONEY IN.
THIS IS ALL OF OUR MONEY.

753
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,001
WE CAN'T LOSE HALF.

754
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,481
BUT YOU KEEP HALF.

755
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,164
WE DON'T NEED THAT!
WHAT IS THAT?

756
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,401
SOLD!

757
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,164
AND YOU KEEP MAKING
MONEY NO MATTER WHAT!

758
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,890
REAL ESTATE IS
A FICKLE BITCH.

759
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,247
OKAY, MAYBE IT'S
BEST YOU JUST GO.

760
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,651
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
OKAY.

761
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,801
THAT WAS NOT HELPFUL.

762
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,206
WELL,OKAY.

763
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,325
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
WHAT IS THIS?

764
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,970
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YEAH.

765
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,770
WE'RE THROWING
A ROBERT DE NIRO PARTY.

766
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,328
SHOULD BE PRETTY
FUCKING LOUD.

767
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,847
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA GO
PRETTY FUCKING LATE, TOO.

768
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,361
<I>I'M TAXI DRIVER DE</I> NIRO.

769
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,244
YEAH, <I>I'M MEET THE FOCKERS
DE</I> NIRO.

770
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,641
I'M WATCHING YOU.
I'M WATCHING YOU.

771
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,644
WHO PAINTED THAT MOLE ON YOUR FACE?
DID YOU DO THAT YOURSELF?

772
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,848
YES, I DID.
YES, I DID, FOCKER.

773
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,001
WHO ARE YOU?

774
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,364
OH, I'M SAM JACKSON, YOU KNOW,
FROM <I>JACKIE</I> BROWN.

775
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,086
HOO-AH!

776
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,406
ALL: HOO-AH!

777
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,131
THAT'S AL PACINO.
THAT'S NOT EVEN... YEAH.

778
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,247
<I>SCENT</I> OF A WOMAN.

779
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
ALL: HOO-AH!

780
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,720
THERE'S
NO CONSISTENCY HERE.

781
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,484
YOU'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE
WITH YOUR REFERENCES.

782
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,641
YOU'RE UPSETTING
JINXY CAT.

783
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,246
JUST STOP DOING THIS
STUPID SHIT! WE'RE SORRY.

784
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,880
HEY, WHEN YOU CALLED THE COPS, YOU
VIOLATED THE CIRCLE OF TRUST, FOCKER.

785
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,042
WE'RE SORRY WE
CALLED THE COPS, OKAY?

786
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,401
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

787
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,607
MAC: YES.
KELLY: YES.

788
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,761
ARE YOU TALKING
TO ME?

789
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,887
YES!
YES!

790
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,041
NO, YOU TALKING TO ME.

791
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,406
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

792
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,720
I DON'T SEE
ANYONE ELSE HERE.

793
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,926
I DON'T SEE ANYONE
ELSE HERE, EITHER!

794
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,166
WE'RE TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU.

795
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,608
"THE PATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS MAN
IS BESET ON ALL SIDES..."

796
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,650
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S
THE WRONG SAM JACKSON SPEECH!

797
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,563
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME,
OR ARE YOU TALKING TO HIM?

798
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,687
(OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS)

799
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,683
JUST GET OFF!
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

800
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,841
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

801
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,921
YOU GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE.

802
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,001
STOP IT!

803
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,481
HEY. WHAT'S NICE
IS IN A FEW YEARS,

804
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,887
WE'LL HAVE A THIRD
PERSON TO HELP US DO THIS.

805
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,081
HEY.

806
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,329
WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE,
SWEETIE?

807
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,526
IS THAT A BALLOON?

808
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,491
DID YOU FIND A BALLOON?

809
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,569
OH, SHIT! THAT'S
NOT A BALLOON!

810
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,046
OH, JESUS!
(SCREAMS)

811
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,730
OH, GOD! OH, NO!

812
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,211
HELP! HELP!

813
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,408
GET THE FUCK...
GET OUT OF MY WAY! MOVE!

814
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,409
DOCTOR! DOCTOR!
OH, GOD!

815
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,685
ALL RIGHT.
HEY.

816
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,364
YOUR BABY

817
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,290
HAS HIV.

818
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,526
(GASPS)
OH, MY GOD.

819
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,603
IS HOW BAD THIS
COULD HAVE GONE.

820
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,686
THE CONDOM WAS UNUSED.

821
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,086
(MURMURING) ARE YOU FUCKING
KIDDING ME?

822
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,084
WHO THE FUCK SAYS THAT
TO A COUPLE OF PARENTS?

823
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,687
HEY! MA'AM!

824
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,921
CHILL OUT, CHILL OUT!

825
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,366
THEY ARE DANGEROUS
TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!

826
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,851
THERE'S A CLEAR
FOCUS GOING ON HERE.

827
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,285
I HEARD THEY BURNED
DOWN THEIR LAST HOUSE.

828
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,203
AND THEY WERE
REPRIMANDED FOR THAT.

829
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,489
WE HAVE A VERY STRICT THREE-STRIKE
POLICY AT THIS SCHOOL.

830
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,490
SO, THEY HAVE ONE STRIKE. IF THEY
GET TWO MORE, THEN THEY'RE OUT.

831
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,761
A STRIKE?

832
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,763
WELL, LISTEN,
THE WAY I DO MY JOB IS,

833
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,286
YOU KNOW, I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT THE HEADLINES, RIGHT?

834
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,161
SO, "DUKE LACROSSE TEAM RAPES
STRIPPER." BAD HEADLINE.

835
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,969
"FRATERNITY
KEEPS COUPLE AWAKE"?

836
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,168
THAT'S NOT REALLY
EVEN A HEADLINE.

837
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,408
I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WOULD
MAKE THE LOCAL POLICE BLOTTER.

838
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,403
GET READY TO READ
THE HEADLINE OF THE CENTURY.

839
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,564
EXTRA, EXTRA!
"BABY SWALLOWS CONDOM!"

840
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,370
THAT'S DISGUSTING!
EXACTLY!

841
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,925
IT'S THE FRAT'S CONDOM!
THAT'S THE FRAT'S CONDOM!

842
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,645
I HAVE A HEADLINE FOR THIS.

843
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,007
"FRATERNITY
PRACTICES SAFE SEX."

844
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,401
THAT'S A GOOD HEADLINE. I COULD
GET A RAISE OFF THAT HEADLINE.

845
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,971
I GOT A HEADLINE FOR YOU.

846
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,331
"MEAN DEAN DOESN'T REALIZE THAT
FRAT LS BAD FOR EVERYONE."

847
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,527
IT'S REALLY NOT.

848
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,041
IT'S VERY POORLY WORDED. I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD EVER MAKE IT TO PRINT.

849
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,281
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL.

850
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,807
I WENT HERE, OKAY?
THAT'S WHY I'M DUMB!

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,042
YOU KNOW WHAT? I JUST THOUGHT
OF ANOTHER HEADLINE.

852
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,403
"NEGLIGENT PARENTS
ALLOW BABY TO SWALLOW CONDOM."

853
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,004
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
IT'S NOT A GOOD HEADLINE.

854
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,961
HERE'S A HEADLINE. HOW
ABOUT, "GO FUCK YOURSELF"?

855
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,121
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.

856
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,486
THIS IS OUR HOME!
IT'S OUR HOME!

857
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,848
THIS IS OUR LITTLE CUB ON OUR
LAWN WITH A CONDOM IN HER MOUTH.

858
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,763
OH, MY GOD.
I'M A MAMA BEAR.

859
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,921
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

860
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,963
I'M GONNA ACT ALL
DOCILE AND THEN...

861
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,451
(BOTH ROARING)

862
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,602
MY CLAWS ARE OUT!
I'M GONNA FUCKING GET THEM!

863
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,531
(HISSING)
FUCK THESE FUCKING GUYS!

864
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,205
THEY DON'T KNOW WHO
THEY ARE FUCKING WITH.

865
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,124
THEY THINK I'M
JUST A REGULAR DAD

866
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,009
AND THEN YOU
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?

867
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,366
BOOM! BOOM!

868
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,647
TEDDY'S DEAD!
PETE'S DEAD! SCOONIE'S DEAD!

869
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,121
FUCK YOU!
NO, NO.

870
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,645
I'LL FUCKING KILL THEM!
NO, NO.

871
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,290
BOOM!
NO.

872
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,925
I'M BUYING A FUCKING GUN!
NO, YOU'RE NOT!

873
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,242
I'M NOT BUYING A GUN!
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S A BAD IDEA.

874
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,441
BAD CALL.

875
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,601
WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THOSE
SMALL PROSTITUTE GUNS?

876
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,125
NO. YOU'RE NOT BUYING A GUN.

877
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,646
(EXHALES) FUCK!

878
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,966
WHAT CAN WE DO?
THAT FUCKING DEAN.

879
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,202
WHAT WOMAN IS NAMED "DEAN"?

880
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,164
SHE'S NOT NAMED "DEAN."
THAT'S HER JOB.

881
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,244
WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT "DEAN" IS HERE.

882
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,561
NO.
YEAH.

883
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,085
REALLY?
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

884
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,491
I THOUGHT THAT WAS HER NAME.
NO.

885
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,641
OH, NO.

886
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,649
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT IN AUSTRALIA?
"CHANCELLOR."

887
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,325
NO, SHE'S THE CHANCELLOR.

888
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,643
OH, MY GOD.
I WAS SO RUDE TO HER.

889
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,649
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

890
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,001
WHAT DIDN'T WE
HAVE IN COLLEGE?

891
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,685
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

892
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,921
I HAD NO MONEY EITHER.
WE HAD NO MONEY.

893
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,161
THEY'RE BROKE.
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

894
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,924
WE FUCK WITH THEIR HOUSE.
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX IT.

895
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,446
YES.
THEY HAVE TO MOVE.

896
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,846
YEAH, FUCK THEM!
FUCK THEM!

897
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,081
WE'RE GONNA FUCKING FUCK THEM!
FUCK THEM!

898
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,203
WE ARE GOING TO FUCK THEM!
FUCK THEM!

899
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,681
(BOTH SCREAMING)

900
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,571
(ALL GROANING)

901
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,684
SO THE WATER CAME OUT OF HERE?
YEP.

902
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,371
THIS IS GONNA RUIN US.

903
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,285
I MEAN, THE FOUNDATION IS FLOODED.
WE CAN'T PAY FOR THIS SHIT.

904
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,964
THEY'RE GONNA
CONDEMN THE HOUSE.

905
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,451
OKAY, WELL,
ON THAT NOTE,

906
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,045
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CLEAN UP AND NOT

907
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,685
STAND HERE WITH OUR
DICKS IN OUR HANDS.

908
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,964
"DICKS IN OUR HANDS."

909
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,449
DICKS IN OUR HANDS.

910
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,529
DICKS IN OUR HANDS.

911
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,049
DICKS IN OUR HANDS.

912
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,362
DICKS IN OUR HANDS.

913
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,086
TEDDY, HOW MUCH TIME WE GOT?

914
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,403
JUST A COUPLE MINUTES, AND
THEN WE POUR IN THE LATEX.

915
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,642
WE'VE GOT DELTA PSI DILDOS
WE CAN MERCHANDISE.

916
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,282
OH, GOD, I CAN'T KEEP
MY BONER MUCH LONGER.

917
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,241
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BONERS?

918
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,044
YEAH.
NOBODY WANTS A LIMP DILDO.

919
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,007
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. PEOPLE
COULD WANT IT FOR AFTER.

920
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,562
LIKE, FOR CUDDLING,
AND IT'S LIKE A LOVE...

921
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,410
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S JUST A LIMP DICK.

922
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,251
HEY, YOU BOYS
HAVE TO GO DIGITAL.

923
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,925
LOOK AT THAT
3-D PRINTER GO.

924
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,041
LOOK AT IT GO!

925
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,286
THAT'S AWESOME.

926
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,601
<I>ELECTRONIC VOICE:
PENIS COMPLETED.</I>

927
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,366
NOW I CAN GO TO CLASS
WHILE MY DICK PRINTS.

928
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,441
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

929
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,085
GOT IT AT MY ARCHITECTURE LAB.
PRETTY COOL, RIGHT?

930
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,605
WOW. MAN, YOU SHOULD
GO TO CLASS SOMETIME.

931
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,967
WE HAVE EXCELLENT FACILITIES
THAT, LIKE, NO ONE USES.

932
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,042
ALL RIGHT, LET'S PULL THESE BAD
BOYS OFF AND SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.

933
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,207
WE'RE GOOD?
YEAH.

934
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,361
GARF: LET'S DO IT.

935
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,448
THIS IS LIKE CHRISTMAS.
OH!

936
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,601
WOW.
WHOA.

937
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,649
HEY, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE
CLAY IS STUCK TO MY PUBES.

938
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,085
WHY DO YOU HAVE PUBES?

939
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,889
WAIT. YOU GUYS SHAVED?

940
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,644
DUDE, I TEXTED YOU.
I SAID, "SHAVE."

941
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,842
I THOUGHT WE WERE TAKING PICTURES.
I CLEANED UP A LITTLE, BUT...

942
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,967
NOT YOUR FACE.

943
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,641
OH, GOD.

944
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,881
OH, SHIT. OH, SHIT.

945
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,280
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M GONNA ENJOY THIS.

946
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,521
IT'S NOT GONNA COME OFF.

947
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,886
I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE IT ON.

948
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,406
I'M GONNA DRILL A HOLE, I'M GONNA PEE.
I CAN GET BIGGER PANTS.

949
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,244
LOOK AT ME.
YOU TRUST ME, RIGHT?

950
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,407
I'M GONNA
PULL THIS THING OFF.

951
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,527
COME ON, JUST RELAX.
L GOT YOU.

952
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,971
STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!

953
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,724
CALM DOWN. COUNT OF THREE.

954
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,325
TEDDY“.
ONE.

955
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,407
LOOK AT MY EYES.

956
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,811
TWO!
(SHRIEKS)

957
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,291
THAT WAS SO MUCH
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

958
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,405
SCOONIE: LADIES,
I NEED A SINGLE-FILE LINE.

959
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,721
THERE WILL BE NO
CUTTING IN THIS LINE,

960
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,241
AND IF YOU'RE IN THE BACK IT IS
APPROXIMATELY A 20-MINUTE WAIT.

961
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,561
HEY.
HI.

962
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,722
UM... I'LL TAKE A TEDDY.
COOL. HOW ABOUT A PETE?

963
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,206
OH, NO.

964
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,526
I WAS JUST KIDDING, ANYWAY.

965
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,641
SO WEIRD.

966
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,651
HOLY SHIT, GUYS.
I THINK WE MADE $10,000.

967
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,884
HEY, YOU GUYS, IF MY
CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT,

968
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,764
NOT ONLY CAN WE
FIX THE WATER DAMAGE,

969
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,083
BUT WE CAN GET THE BIGGEST
HOT TUB IN THE WORLD!

970
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,569
(CHEERING)
AND OUTDOOR SPEAKERS!

971
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,689
YES!
YEAH!

972
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,650
DELTA PSI!

973
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,006
ALL: (CHANTING) DELTA PSI.

974
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,286
DELTA PSI!
DELTA PSI! DELTA PSI!

975
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,851
DILDO PSI!

976
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,611
DILDO PSI! DILDO PSI!

977
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,565
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

978
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,121
THIS IS FUCKING
RIDICULOUS.

979
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,287
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

980
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,364
THEIR DICKS BOUGHT A HOT TUB?
MY DICK COULDN'T BUY A HOT TUB.

981
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,726
HEY.

982
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,043
YOUR DICK COULD BUY MORE THAN A HOT TUB.
YOUR DICK BOUGHT ME.

983
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,005
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

984
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,650
I'M NOT A SIZEIST.

985
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,564
THAT'S A LITTLE
PATRONIZING.

986
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,206
(MOUTHING)

987
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,970
I DON'T GET IT. WHO WOULD
EVEN BUY ONE OF THOSE DILDOS?

988
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,166
<I>BROS BEFORE HOS.</I>

989
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,244
<I>WHY? BECAUSE YOUR BROS
ARE ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU.</I>

990
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,041
<I>THEY HAVE GOT YOUR BACK AFTER
YOUR HO RIPS YOUR HEART OUT.</I>

991
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,406
"BROS BEFORE HOS."

992
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,881
<I>AND YOU WERE NOTHING
BUT GREAT TO YOUR HO.</I>

993
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,687
<I>AND YOU TOLD HER THAT SHE
WAS THE ONLY HO FOR YOU,</I>

994
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,043
<I>AND THAT SHE WAS BETTER THAN ALL
THE OTHER HOS IN THE WORLD.</I>

995
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,562
BROS BEFORE HOS.

996
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,163
FRATERNITIES. THEY LIVE AND DIE
ON THE CONCEPT OF BROTHERHOOD.

997
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,241
I KNOW.

998
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,288
THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK IT
APART IS TO GET IN THERE,

999
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,921
INFILTRATE A PARTY, AND GET
THEM TO PUT HOS BEFORE BROS.

1000
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,287
HOS DON'T GO BEFORE BROS. IT
JUST DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

1001
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,805
A HO HAS NEVER
GONE BEFORE A BRO.

1002
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,922
MAYBE I HAVE BEEN A HO
WHO'S TAKEN DOWN SOME BROS.

1003
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,850
HO, NO, YOU HAVEN'T.
I'M JUST SAYING.

1004
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,002
YOU HAVE?
THAT IS MESSED UP.

1005
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,451
I'M SAYING,
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.

1006
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,204
WE'VE GOT TO GET IN THERE,
WE GOTTA INFILTRATE.

1007
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,965
GET THOSE LITTLE MOTHERFUCKERS,
TURN THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER.

1008
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,166
OKAY.
I'M SERIOUS.

1009
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,446
JUST EASE UP.

1010
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,681

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,330
WHY DON'T I STICK
SOMETHING UP YOUR ASS?

1181
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,449
NO, NOT TONIGHT. NOT TONIGHT.

1182
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,601
CAN I STICK
SOMETHING UP YOUR ASS?

1183
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,721
NO, I'M NOT THAT DRUNK.

1184
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,847

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,170
I'M NOT GONNA COME.

1191
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,289
IT'S GONE MUSHY.
THANK YOU, SIRE.

1192
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,247
(IN BRITISH ACCENT) I WILL TAKE THE
GENTLEMAN'S ROUTE OUT AND CALL IT A DAY,

1193
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,484

1195
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,727
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
THAT'S HOW ADULTS DO IT.

1196
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,161
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

1197
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,805

BABY, WE'RE A HOT TEAM.

1200
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,923
MY BOOBS REALLY HURT.

1201
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,683
I THINK I SHOULD
PROBABLY PUMP.

1202

THERE'S BOOZE IN YOUR BOOBS.
THERE'S BOOZE IN YOUR BOOBS.

1225
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,370
IT'S POISON.

1226
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,124
THERE'S ALCOHOL IN THERE.

1227
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,731
IT'S LIKE A WHITE RUSSIAN.

1237
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,801
OH, NO.

1238

1240
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,525
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?

1241
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,128
OH, GROSS! THEY LOOK
LIKE MY GRANDMA'S LEGS.

1242
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,611
OKAY, LET ME CALL MY MOM. SHE'LL
TELL US WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.

1243
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,125
DO NOT CALL YOUR MOTHER!

1244
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,681
JESUS! YOU JEWS AND
YOUR FUCKING MOTHERS!

1245
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,961

MILK ME.

1247
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,281
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MILK ME.

1248
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,408
I DON'T WANT TO MILK YOU.
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO.

1249
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,209
I DON'T FUCKING WANT TO!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "MILK YOU"?

1250
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,281
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE!

00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,441
BE A MAN AND MILK ME.

1252
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,887
MILK YOURSELF!

1253
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,961

YOUR HANDS AND KNEES.

1258
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,802
I'M NOT A COW!
WELL, HOW ELSE DO YOU DO IT?

1259
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,087
JUST, NORMAL.

1260
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,128
THERE'S NO NORMAL WAY
TO MILK A HUMAN WOMAN.

1261
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,481
OKAY, OKAY!
COME ON!

1262
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,561

1263
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,130
I CAN'T DO IT.
DON'T YELL, JUST TRY TO...

1264
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,486
COME ON! OW!
I'M SORRY.

1265
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,446

OKAY.

1272
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,846
WHOO!

1273
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,286
WE ARE NOT HIGH-FIVING.

1274
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,771
OH, GOD.

1275
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,126
IT TASTES FUNNY.

1276
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,203
THEY SAY IT TASTES GOOD TO THE BABY.
IT TASTES FUNNY TO ME.

1277
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,209
JUST RELAX. JUST SETTLE DOWN.
OKAY.

1278
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,848
I GOT, LIKE,
FOUR PAILS OUT OF YOU.

1279
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,005
WE SHOULD GO

1280
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,724
(LAUGHING)
HEY, TOO SOON.

1281
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,211
OKAY, TOO SOON.

1283
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,762
MOO-OOD.

1284
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,365
STOP IT.

1285
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,529
I'M GONNA MOVE BACK TO

1286
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,122
NOW I CAN'T STOP
THINKING OF THEM.

1287
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,281
OKAY
MAC...

1288
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,449
THAT WAS UDDER-LY TRAUMATIC.

1289
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,961
PLEASE STOP.

1290
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,050
HOW MUCH OF YOU IS
TRAUMATIZED? 2%? 1%?

1291
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,926
THAT WAS A CHEESY ONE.

1292
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,320
THAT WAS GOOD.
YOU LIKE THAT?

1293
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,084
YOU DID IT. SEE?
(LAUGHS)

1294
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,366
YEAH?

1295
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,010
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU HEAR THAT?

1296
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,486
IT'S VICTORY.

1297
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,926
WE CAN FINALLY GO
BACK TO OUR LIVES.

1298
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,280
IT'S OVER.

1299
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,963
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
WHERE'S PETE?

1300
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,565
I DON'T KNOW. AT SOME
JOB FAIR OR SOME SHIT.

1301
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,011
WHAT THE HECK'S MORE
IMPORTANT THAN THIS?

1302
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,124
HEY, I JUST WANNA
LET YOU GUYS KNOW

1303
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,521
THAT I ATE A WHOLE POT BROWNIE
BEFORE COMING IN HERE

1304
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,967
AND I AM REALLY STARTING TO
FEEL IT RIGHT NOW. YEAH.

1305
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,405
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

1306
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,246
GUYS, DON'T TALK.
PLEASE LET ME HANDLE THIS.

1307
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,447

1310
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,081
WHAT IS THIS?

1311
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,241
IT'S A HEADLINE.

1312
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,204
IS IT A GOOD ONE,
OR A BAD ONE?

1313
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,561
IT'S A BAD ONE.

1314
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,130
YEAH, IT'S
A REALLY BAD ONE.

1315
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,805
IT'S A BAD ONE.

1316
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,281
I PROMISE YOU, AS
THE PRESIDENT OF DELTA PSI,

1317
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,846
THAT WE WILL FIND
A WAY TO RIGHT THIS WRONG.

(LAUGHING)

1319
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,000
VERY SORRY ABOUT THIS.

1320
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,970
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.

1321
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,087
THAT'S TWO STRIKES.

1322
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,730
YOU'RE ON PROBATION
UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR.

1323
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,287
OKAY? YOU SO MUCH
AS THROW A PARTY,

1324
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,285
GENERATE A NOISE COMPLAINT, OR
END UP ON ANY SORT OF HEADLINE,

1325
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,691
AND YOU ARE OUT.

1326
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,046
PLEASE DON'T PUT US
ON PROBATION.

1327
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,004
WHAT ABOUT THE
END-OF-THE-YEAR BASH, TEDDY?

1328
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,407
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO GET ON THE
WALL, PLUS WE BOUGHT THE KEGS.

1329
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,369
WHAT, IS SHE GONNA REIMBURSE
US FOR THOSE KEGS?

1330
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,090
ARE YOU GONNA REIMBURSE
US FOR THOSE KEGS? NO.

1331
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,730

MMM-HMM.

1335
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,044
I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I ATE A
POT BROWNIE BEFORE COMING IN HERE.

1336
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,203
I'M THE OPPOSITE OF THE
PERSON YOU SAY THAT TO.

1337
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,284

TWO STRIKES, RIGHT THERE.

1340
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,160
HOLY SHIT.

1341
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,004
I'M JUST KIDDING. SORT OF.

1342
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,406
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

1343
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,005
THANKS FOR MISSING
OUR MEETING, MR. VP.

1344
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,208
I HAD THIS JOB INTERVIEW,

1345
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,047
NO, NO, CLEARLY YOU HAD
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO.

1346
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,286
YEAH.

1347

OH, IT WENT GREAT.
IT WENT GREAT.

1349
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,889
WE'RE ON PROBATION.
WE CAN'T PARTY.

1350
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,923
SHIT. THAT'S A BUMMER.
MMM-HMM.

1351
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,007
SO, ARE WE COOL WITH
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

1352
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,321

JUNK BEFORE TRUNK.

1356
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,645
ALL RIGHT,
BALLS BEFORE DOLLS.

1357
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,451
<I>COMPADRES BEFORE
I SLEEP WITH U MADRES.</I>

1358
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,329
BRAD PITT BEFORE GRAB CLIT.

00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,010
DEEZ NUTS BEFORE
SKINNY SLUTS.

1360
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,809
MASTURBATE BEFORE
I ASK HER TO DATE.

1361
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,451
BEEF STEW BEFORE
WATCHING THE VIEW.

1362
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,966

1365
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,445
MAN PURSES

1366
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,567
MAKES SENSE.
YEAH.

1367
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,607
OKAY.
IT DOES.

1368
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,923
SPORTS BEFORE GENITAL WARTS...
NO, FUCKIN'. THAT'S BAD.

1369
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,968
THAT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD.
I'M FADING A LITTLE BIT.

1370
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,485

YEAH. ARE YOU A DELTA?

1380
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,370
NO, MY ROOMMATE WAS. I USED TO

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,769
WE'RE ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES

1389
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,564

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,087
SO, YOU HAVE A NICE DAY.

1391
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,241
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1392
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,410
IT MEANS YOU'RE TOO DUMB.

1393
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,521
GOOD LUCK, BRO.

1394
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,727
OKAY.

1395
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,526
PETE: I HOPE WE CAN "BUILD"
A GREAT FUTURE TOGETHER.

1396
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,601
ARCHITECTURE JOKE.

1397
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,761
I KNOW!

1398
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,604
I LIKE TO HAVE FUN WITH IT.

1399
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,000
LAME.

YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST THINKING,

1404
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,611
IT WOULD BE GREAT
TO HAVE YOU AND KELLY

1405
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,405
AND YOUR LITTLE PRINCESS
OVER FOR A PLAY DATE.

1406
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,483
WE'LL PUT IT ON THE BOOKS.
OKAY, COOL. GREAT.

1407
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,210
SOMETIME SOON. I'LL JUST...
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,281
YEAH.

1409
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,288
"AND THE DOG GOES,
'WOOF, WOOF, WOOF, WOOF!

1410
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,922
"'WOOF, WOOF, WOOF!"'

1411
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,483
<I>OH, HI, BABY.
MAC: HOW'S IT GOING?</I>

1412
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,327
OH, GOOD.

1413
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,481
I'M FINE.

1414
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,329
I'M A BIT BORED,
BUT I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

1415
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,686
<I>YEAH, I'M BORED, TOO.</I>

1416
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,524
<I>MY BOSS JUST INVITED US

1417
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,165
<I>SO WE CAN BOTH
JUST KILL EACH OTHER.</I>

1418
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,401
(STELLA CRYING ON MONITOR)

1419
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,801
<I>I KIND OF MISS THE RUSH
OF MESSING WITH THE FRAT.</I>

1420
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,525
I HAVE TO GO. SHE'S AWAKE.

1421
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,489
<I>OKAY, CALL ME AFTER.
CALL ME SOON.</I>

1422
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,165
TEDDY: HEY, NEIGHBOR.

1423
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,200
OOH!

1424
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,406
(ALL LAUGHING)

1425
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,367
OKAY. ARE YOU READY?

1426
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,090
ME AND KELLY,
WE HAVE FOUND A WAY

1427
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,850
TO GIVE THE FRAT
THEIR LAST STRIKE.

1428
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,570
GET THEM OUT OF HERE FOREVER!
OUT!

1429
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,166
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? DIDN'T
WE ALREADY WIN? REMEMBER?

1430
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,527
"BROS BEFORE HOS," THAT WHOLE THING?
IT'S OVER!

1431
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,648
THEY'RE STILL FUCKING THERE!
THERE'S BEER CANS ON THE LAWN.

1432
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,721
THEY'RE BARBECUING.

1433
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,926
SO?
"SO?"

1434
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,206
IT SMELLS DELICIOUS IN HERE.

1435
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,930
TRY LIVING NEXT TO IT.
TRY LIVING NEXT TO IT!

1436
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,570
HEY, YOU GUYS DON'T
WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR

1437
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,250
BORING ASS LIVES AS PARENTS.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

1438
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,243
I'M SURPRISED AND
SHOCKED, HONESTLY,

1439
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,924
THAT IT IS SO HARD
TO CONVINCE YOU,

1440
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,610
OF ALL PEOPLE,
THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

1441
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,727
WHAT?

1442
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,771
ONE OF THOSE CHILDS IS
HAVING SEX WITH YOUR WIFE.

1443
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,008
IT'S FINE. WE'RE DIVORCED.

1444
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,964
JIMMY! WAKE UP!
WAKE UP, MAN.

1445
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,121
HIS DICK IS THIS BIG!

1446
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,282
"HEY, HOMIE. I'M GONNA FUCK
YOUR WIFE WITH MY GIANT DICK."

1447
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,725
"OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS AMAZING."

1448
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,245
"OH, MY GOD, HOMIE.
IT FEELS SO GOOD."

1449
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,526
"OH, HOMIE."
"WOW. OH, MY GOD."

1450
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,170
"IT FEELS SO GOOD, HOMIE."
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?"

1451
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,287
"OH, HOMIE, LET'S DO IT.
OH, GOD, HOMIE."

1452
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,447
"THAT'S AMAZING."

1453
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,727
OKAY, ENOUGH! STOP IMITATING!

1454
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,768
I GET IT!
HE'S GOT A HUGE DICK!

1455
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,007
AND HER VAGINA, "BYE!"
IT'S RUINED!

1456
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,201
MAC: DESTROYED. GONE!

1457
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,964
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU LEND
A FAT FRIEND YOUR SHIRT,

1458
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,407
AND IT COMES BACK, AND IT'S
ALL STRETCHY AND FLAPPY!

1459
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,565
SAGGING ALL OVER THE PLACE!
IT'LL BE LIKE THIS.

1460
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,046
I'M IN!
MAC: YES!

1461
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,170
NICE! NICE! GREAT!
AWESOME, AWESOME!

1462
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,571
WHAT'S THE PLAN?
OKAY, OKAY.

1463
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,125
WE'VE BEEN THINKING.
WHAT GETS FRATS

1464
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,685
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOLS
MORE THAN ANYTHING?

1465
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,366
RAPE!

1466
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,647
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

1467
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,131
HAZING SCANDALS.
HAZING SCANDALS!

1468
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,167
YES!
HAZING SCANDALS!

1469
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,241
HAZING SCANDALS!
YES!

1470
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,924
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID IT
BEFORE YOU LET ME ANSWER.

1471
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,328
WE NEED ALL THAT EQUIPMENT
YOU BOUGHT TO SPY ON PAULA.

1472
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,211
<I>L</I> DIDN'T...
(LAUGHS) WHAT?

1473
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,406
JUST STOP.

1474
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,090
MAC: LOOK, YOU JUST TAKE
THESE SPY GLASSES.

1475
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,090
THEY LOOK TOTALLY
LIKE NORMAL GLASSES.

1476
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,645
YOU WEAR THEM
INTO THE FRAT HOUSE.

1477
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,165
TEDDY'S GONNA START
PUSHING YOU AROUND

1478
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,691
AND FUCKING WITH YOU,
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.

1479
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,364
LIKE I'VE SEEN HIM
DO A MILLION TIMES.

1480
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,841
AT THAT MOMENT,
YOU JUST PUSH BACK.

1481
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,809
OKAY? JUST PUSH BACK.

1482
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,484
THE REST WILL
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

1483
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,085
HE'LL HAZE
THE FUCKING SHIT OUT OF YOU.

1484
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,690
IT'LL ALL GET
CAUGHT ON THIS CAMERA.

1485
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,042
DELTA PSI IS GONE,
YOU'RE A FREE MAN.

1486
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,927
THOSE GUYS ARE MY BROTHERS.

1487
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,047
KELLY: YOUR BROTHERS?

1488
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,088
DO YOU THINK YOUR BROTHERS WOULD
REALLY TREAT YOU LIKE THAT?

1489
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,241
THINK ABOUT WHAT
THEY'VE DONE TO YOU.

1490
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,646
THEY DEHUMANIZED YOU.

1491
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,643
THEY TREATED YOU LIKE SHIT.
THEY DEGRADED YOU.

1492
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,325
JIMMY: YOU'RE AN ANIMAL.
THEY CALLED YOU ASSJUICE.

1493
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,441
ASSJUICE.

1494
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,011
KELLY: ASSJUICE.
MAC: ASSJUICE.

1495
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,764
JIMMY: SUBHUMAN.
KELLY: ASSJUICE.

1496
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,604
ALL: ASSJUICE. ASSJUICE.

1497
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,728
ASSJUICE. ASSJUICE.

1498
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,123
ASSJUICE! ASSJUICE!
ASSJUICE! ASSJUICE!

1499
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,408
YOU BETTER EAT THIS
FUCKING DOG FOOD, NOW!

1500
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,927
(SCREAMING)

1501
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,001
PETE: WHAT'S THE LESSON?

1502
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,249
BOYS: DON'T GO TO SLEEP!

1503
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,364
THIS IS YOUR DESTINY,
ASSJUICE.

1504
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,401
ASSJUICE!

1505
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,761
ALL: (CHANTING)
ASSJUICE! ASSJUICE! ASSJUICE!

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,530
<I>ASSJUICE! ASSJUICE!</I>

1507
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,607
I DON'T KNOW.

1508
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,681
JIMMY: EVERYONE BREAKS, BRO.

1509
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,126
BIOLOGY

1510
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,611
<I>THAT'S FROM ZERO DARK THIRTY.</I>

1511
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,170
YOU GUYS DON'T GET IT.

1512
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,444
I'VE GONE THROUGH HELL.

1513
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,444
I'M NOT GONNA THROW
THAT ALL AWAY NOW.

1514
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,127
YOU KNOW HOW MANY BJS
I'VE BEEN PROMISED?

1515
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,880
INFINITE BJS.

1516
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,368
INFINITE. INFINITE.

1517
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,210
INFINITE BJS.

WE'LL GIVE YOU $1,000.

1520
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,285
OKAY. I'M IN.

00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,726
NICE!

1522
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,963
NICE! THAT WAS GOOD! JIMMY: THAT WAS GOOD.
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

1523
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,530
THAT WAS GOOD.
THAT WAS SEXY, TOO.

1524
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,925
HE LOOKS LIKE J.J. ABRAMS.

1525
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,846
MAC: YOU LOOK GOOD. IT LOOKS OKAY.
I THINK IT'S OKAY.

1526
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,001
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA FORGET THIS!

1527
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,004

1530
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,086
I'M NOT DOING THIS ANYMORE.

1535
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,046
<I>I AM NOT AN ELEPHANT!</I>

1536
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,560
HE'S DOING IT.
HE'S DOING IT.

1537
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,405
<I>I'M A HUMAN MAN!

1538
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,403
<I>WE ALL HAVE DIGNITY!

1539
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,281
<I>OUR NAMES ARE NOT FUCKHEAD,

1540
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,720
LEA MICHELE FROM <I>GLEE?</I>
THAT'S ACTUALLY FUNNY.

1541
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,841
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

1542
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,167
IT'S EVAN.

1543
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,731

1544
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,401

THAT'S GREAT. OKAY, OKAY.

<I>YOU'RE IN SO MUCH FUCKING TROUBLE.

1552
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,121

I'M SORRY.
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

1555
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,841
WHAT'S GOING ON, GARY?

1556
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,042
<I>ARE YOU OKAY, MAN?
YOU SEEM DISTRAUGHT.</I>

1557
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,844
"YOU SEEM DISTRAUGHT"?

1558
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,207
<I>I MEAN, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN, IN MY
OPINION, LIKE, OUR STRONGEST PLEDGE,</I>

00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,520
<I>AND NOW YOU'RE TALKING BACK.</I>

1560
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,886
<I>ASSJUICE: I'M SCARED.
YOU'RE SCARED?</I>

1561
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,163
<I>I'M FUCKING SCARED, MAN.
I'M TIRED ALL THE TIME.</I>

1562
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,368
<I>FUCKING TIRED.
I MISS MY MOM.</I>

1563
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,204
<I>OH, NO, ASSJUICE.
BREAKING? THE GUY WAS RIGHT.</I>

1564
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,247
<I>EVERYBODY BREAKS.</I>

1565
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,731
<I>OKAY. I 'II TELL YOU WHAT.</I>

1566
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,325
<I>YOU GO UP TO MY ROOM.</I>

1567
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,880
<I>LOCK THE DOOR,
DRAW YOURSELF A BATH. RELAX.</I>

1568
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,451
(GASPS)
"DRAW YOURSELF A BATH"?

1569
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,728
<I>CATCH UP ON SOME Z 'S,
OKAY? TAKE A NAP.</I>

1570
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,330
<I>FULL SEASON OF GIRLS

1571
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,811
WE NEVER PLANNED FOR NICE.

1572
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,251
<I>THANKS FOR TALKING TO ME,
BROTHER. ALL RIGHT?</I>

1573
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,001
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME TO ME WITH
THIS KIND OF STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

1574
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,961
YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.
SEE YOU UPSTAIRS.

1575
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,885
(BOTH IMITATING EXPLOSIONS)

1576
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,360
<I>I'M SORRY, GUYS.
HE'S TOO GOOD OF A DUDE.</I>

1577
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,485
<I>NO!
TEDDY!</I>

1578
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,929
<I>WHAT'S UP?
YEAH, ONE MORE THING.</I>

1579
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,001
NO MORE THING!

1580
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,168
<I>THESE GLASSES,
THERE'S A CAMERA IN THEM.</I>

1581
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,407
ALL; NO!

1582
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,567
OH, MY GOD!

1583
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,886
THE ASSET'S GONE ROGUE.

1584
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,001
SHIT, HE'S STILL TALKING.

1585
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,081
<I>ASSJUICE: YOUR NEIGHBORS
GOT ME TO WEAR THEM,</I>

1586
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,366
<I>SO THEY COULD
FILM YOU HAZING US,</I>

1587
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,720
<I>SO THE FRATERNITY
WOULD GET DISSOLVED.</I>

1588
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,044
<I>AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME. NO, NO, NO, NO.
THEY FLOODED THE BASEMENT.</I>

1589
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,931
<I>THEY GOT BROTHER PETE TO
HOOK UP WITH SISTER BROOKE.</I>

1590
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,161
<I>I'M SO SORRY, MAN.</I>

1591
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,605
<I>IT'S OKAY. THEY'VE BEEN
AFTER US FOR WEEKS.</I>

1592
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,125
NO!
HE'S TELLING HIM EVERYTHING!

1593
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,804
OH, MY GOD!
JESUS CHRIST, GUYS!

1594
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,285
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

1595
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,601
MAC: WAIT.

1596
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,287
HE'S LOOKING AT US.

1597
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,203
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HE'S LOOKING AT US.

1598
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,924
<I>YOU GUYS JUST CROSSED
THE FUCKING LINE. YOU'RE DEAD.</I>

1599
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,601
WE'RE DEAD?

1600
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,081
(YELLS)

1601
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,128
OH, GOD! OH, MY GOD!
THAT WAS SCARY.

1602
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,531
COME ON, GUYS.
JESUS.

1603
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,689
<I>HOW DO YOU TURN THESE OFF?</I>

1604
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,365
<I>ASSJUICE: IT'S ON THE SIDE.</I>

1605
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,885
<I>(SINGING) WE'RE GONNA
GO TO THE SHOPS</I>

1606
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,522
<I>THEN WE'RE GONNA
GO TO MOMMY AND ME</I>

1607
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,042
<I>AND SEE ALL THOSE
BITCHES THAT I HATE</I>

1608
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,886
<I>IT'S GONNA BE REALLY BORING</I>

1609
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,367
<I>BUT WE'LL GET
OUT OF THE HOUSE!</I>

1610
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,681
<I>KELLY: I THINK THE FRAT HAS BROKEN INTO
THE CAR AND STOLEN ALL OF THE AIRBAGS.</I>

1611
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,251
AIRBAGS?
YEAH.

1612
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,084
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
LS ANYTHING ELSE MISSING?

1613
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,605
<I>NO!</I>

1614
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,805
<I>WHY WOULD THEY JUST BREAK IN
AND STEAL THE AIRBAGS?</I>

1615
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,410
I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD
FILE A POLICE REPORT...

1616
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,491
(GROANING)

1617
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,605
WHAT THE FUCK?

1618
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,806
OH, SHIT!

1619
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,171
FOUND THE AIRBAGS!

1620
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,246
THERE'S THREE LEFT!

1621
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,801
FUCK!

1622
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,241
TWO LEFT!
(JIMMY GROANING)

1623
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,770
JIMMY, ARE YOU OKAY?

1624
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,601
I'M FINE!

1625
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,604
IT WASN'T AS BAD AS
IT SEEMED. I'M FINE.

1626
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,524
DELTA PSI HAS
THE UPPER HAND!

1627
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,406
WE WENT TOO FAR NOW.
THIS IS DANGEROUS.

1628
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,570
WE DID NOT GO TOO FAR.

1629
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,608
NOW IS WHEN WE GET
THEM BACK EVEN MORE.

1630
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,444
DO YOU SEE WHAT THEY FUCKING DID TO ME?
WE DON'T STOP NOW!

1631
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,807
SO, WHAT IT'S GONNA BE NEXT? THEY'RE
GONNA BREAK INTO THE HOUSE?

1632
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,967
NO. NO.

1633
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,691
YOU NEED TO GROW UP, OKAY?
OUR FAMILY IS IN DANGER.

1634
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,530
I NEED TO GROW UP?
YES, YOU NEED TO GROW UP.

1635
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,882
ONE OF US HAS GOT TO BE THE
ADULT IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

1636
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,126
YOU SHOULD TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY.

1637
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,442
THAT'S NOT ONLY OFFENSIVE,
BUT IT'S FUCKING STUPID.

1638
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,449
IT'S OFFENSIVE THAT I'M SAYING
THAT YOU SHOULD BE SMART?

1639
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,371
YES, IT'S OFFENSIVE THAT I HAVE
TO BE THE SMART ONE ALL THE TIME!

1640
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,925
I'M ALLOWED TO BE
JUST AS IRRESPONSIBLE AS YOU.

1641
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,287
WELL, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS!
I'M THE DUMB GUY,

1642
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,811
AND YOU'RE THE WOMAN
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO

1643
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,365
STOP THE DUMB GUY
FROM DOING DUMB SHIT!

1644
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,522
HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN
A FUCKING KEVIN JAMES MOVIE?

1645
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,762
WE CAN'T BOTH BE KEVIN JAMES.
I'M KEVIN JAMES!

1646
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,604
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF KEVIN JAMES IN ME.

1647
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,727
WELL, WE CAN'T BOTH...

1648
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,962
CLEARLY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KNOWS
BETTER, SO YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

1649
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,249
YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT LIKE THAT,
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN LIKE THAT.

1650
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,890
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE.
THAT'S NEVER BEEN ME.

1651
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,411
JUST BECAUSE I'M
A MOM DOESN'T MEAN

1652
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,010
THAT I'M GONNA
CHANGE WHO I AM.

1653
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,241
WELL, JUST BECAUSE
I'M A FATHER,

1654
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,927
IT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN STOP DOING
MUSHROOMS WITH TEENAGERS.

1655
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,001
FINE!
FINE!

1656
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,087
GOOD.
GOOD, THEN.

1657
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,003
OKAY, KEVIN, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE A GOOD TEAM ANYMORE.

1658
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,161
THE TEAM IS BREAKING UP.
YEP.

1659
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,209
THIS WORKED BEFORE
WE HAD STELLA, BUT...

1660
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,010
NOW IT DOESN'T.
IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.

1661
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,400
YEAH, BECAUSE
SOMEONE REFUSES TO GROW UP.

1662
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,521
FINE. OKAY.
FINE THEN.

1663
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,329
YOU GO FIND YOUR
NAGGING WIFE THAT YOU

1664
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,249
WANT TO FIND,
AND I'LL GO FIND A REAL MAN.

1665
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,810
FINE! GOOD TO KNOW.
FINE.

1666
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,201
I DON'T FEEL SAFE HERE,
JUST IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

1667
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,446
WELL, THAT'S CRAZY.

1668
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,641
I'M GONNA TAKE
OUR CHILD AND GO.

1669
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,006
OH, YEAH? WELL,
THAT'S LUDICROUS,

1670
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,050
BECAUSE THIS IS PERHAPS THE
SAFEST PLACE ON THE PLANET,

1671
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,321
JUST SO YOU KNOW!

1672
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,925
YOU'RE KIDNAPPING OUR BABY!
ASSHOLE!

1673
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,570
DON'T KIDNAP OUR BABY!

1674
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,369
I'M GONNA PUT OUT
AN AMBER FUCKING ALERT!

1675
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,249
ENJOY THE HOUSE BY
YOURSELF, YOU CHILD!

1676
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,005
THIS IS SAFER
THAN THE WHITE HOUSE!

1677
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,211
(GROANING)

1678
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,370
DUDE, WE MISSED THE AIRBAG!

1679
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,164
KELLY, THERE'S ONE LEFT!

1680
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,165
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE!

1681
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,291
CW!

1682
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,203
HEY, MAN, DO YOU THINK, MAYBE WE'RE
GOING, LIKE, WAY TOO FAR WITH THIS?

1683
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,608
I MEAN, <I>AS</I> A CHILD
OF DIVORCE, I JUST...

1684
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,251
I CAN'T HELP IT,
I SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM.

1685
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,563
WELL, MY PARENTS LOVE EACH OTHER,
AND I THINK IT'S HILARIOUS.

1686
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,931
(SCREAMS)

1687
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,921
FUCK!

1688
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,921
FUCKERS! FUCK!

1689
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,127
<I>SHALOM,</I> MAC.

1690
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,571
HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY.

1691
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,766
HOW'S IT GOING?
I'M SORRY.

1692
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,405
I'M SO SORRY,
I'M SO SORRY.

1693
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,606
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO SORRY.

1694
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,801
I LOVE YOU, I'M SORRY.

1695
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,211
I WAS SO STUPID.

1696
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,044
WHAT A STUPID
FUCKING FIGHT TO HAVE.

1697
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,326
NO, I WAS STUPID.
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

1698
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,726
I'M SO SORRY.
IT WAS SO DUMB.

1699
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,404
IT WAS REALLY DUMB
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, OKAY?

1700
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,766
DO YOU STILL LIKE ME?
I MISS YOU. I LOVE YOU.

1701
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,966
DO YOU STILL LIKE ME?
YES, I STILL LIKE YOU.

1702
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,684
OKAY, GOOD. I LOVE YOU.
OKAY.

1703
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,600
SHE'S SO CRAZY.

1704
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,926
SHE'S STILL BEHIND YOU.

1705
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,009
HEY.
HI.

1706
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,645
LAME, ISN'T IT, PETE?

1707
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,880
WHOA.

1708
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,606
YOU'RE REALLY
VILLAINING OUT IN HERE.

1709
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,169
WHAT'S LAME?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1710
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,888
LAME THAT
WE'RE ON PROBATION.

1711
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,251
WE'RE NOT GONNA
END UP ON THIS THING.

1712
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,120
THAT IS KIND OF LAME, BUT ALSO
KIND OF MEANINGLESS, RIGHT?

1713
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,531
WHAT THE FUCK ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1714
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,928
NO, MAN. I JUST MEAN, LIKE,
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW?

1715
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,048
IF YOU WANT TO BE UP THERE SO
BAD, JUST PUT YOUR PICTURE UP.

1716
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,087
NO ONE'S GONNA STOP YOU.

1717
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,288
BECAUSE THEN
I DIDN'T EARN IT.

1718
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,126
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING
IF YOU DON'T EARN IT.

1719
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,645
WHO CARES?

1720
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,685
"WHO CARES?"

1721
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,884
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1722
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,529
YOU'RE THE VP, MAN.

1723
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,601
WE HAVE WANTED THIS
SINCE WE WERE FRESHMEN.

1724
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,001
DUDE, THAT WAS
FOUR YEARS AGO, OKAY?

1725
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,208
WE WERE FUCKING VIRGINS.
ALL RIGHT?

1726
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,442
WE'RE ABOUT TO BE,
LIKE, ADULTS NOW.

1727
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,965
IN TWO WEEKS, NONE OF THIS
IS EVEN GONNA MATTER.

1728
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,405
WHAT THE FUCK ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1729
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,802
I MEAN, YOU DO REALIZE THAT ALL THIS
STUFF, IT'S ALL BULLSHIT, RIGHT?

1730
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,245
IT'S ALL MADE UP.

1731
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,767
LIKE, MY BROTHER'S FRATERNITY ALSO
THINKS THEY INVENTED BEER PONG.

1732
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,966
WELL, YOUR BROTHER
IS A LIAR.

1733
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,610
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S PUT THAT DOWN.

1734
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,808
DUDE, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

1735
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,564
BUT I THINK
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT

1736
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,370
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO NEXT YEAR.

1737
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,805
WHAT?

1738
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,331
I'M TRYING TO BE
YOUR FRIEND, OKAY?

1739
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,368
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU TRY
TO HIDE THIS STUFF FROM ME.

1740
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,204
I'M A PSYCHOLOGY MINOR,
YOU KNOW THAT.

1741
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,520
"I'M A PSYCHOLOGY MINOR."

1742
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,489
DUDE, WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE SO OBSESSED

1743
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,489
WITH THAT OLD COUPLE
NEXT DOOR, ALL RIGHT?

1744
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,324
IT'S BECAUSE THEY
REMIND YOU OF THE FUTURE.

1745
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,606
I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

1746
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,170
WHAT THE FUCK ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1747
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,605
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE MY FRIEND?
YES!

1748
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,648
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO
FUCK MY GIRLFRIEND AGAIN?

1749
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,051
WHAT?
YEAH.

1750
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,645
I THOUGHT WE WERE OVER THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU...

1751
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,410
HOW THE FUCK COULD I
BE COOL WITH THAT, MAN?

1752
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,244
YOU HAD SEX
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND!

1753
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,243
WHAT ARE YOU... WE SAID ALL
THOSE THINGS, ALL RIGHT?

1754
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,924
THEY RHYMED!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

1755
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,765
WE SAID SOME SHIT THAT RHYMED?
ARE YOU CRAZY, MAN?

1756
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,444
HOW THE FUCK WOULD
THAT MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

1757
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,047
YOU DON'T THINK I WAS CLEARLY
TRYING TO MASK HOW I REALLY FELT,

1758
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,406
SO I TRIED TO
BRO OUT WITH YOU?

1759
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,130
I DON'T KNOW!
YOU'RE A GOOD ACTOR!

1760
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,964
WHAT THE FUCK AM I
SUPPOSED TO THINK?

1761
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,525
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!

1762
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,046
GOD! DUDE, TAKE YOUR SHIT OUT
ON SOMEONE ELSE, ALL RIGHT?

1763
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,685
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.
OKAY.

1764
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,603
THAT'S RIGHT, PETE.
WALK AWAY.

1765
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,530
BITCH.
OH, MY GOD.

1766
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,726
AHHH!

1767
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,125
SCOONIE PUT HIS
DICK IN YOUR MOUTH

1768
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,605
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING,
BITCH!

1769
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,726
UH-UH. I WASN'T ASLEEP.

1770
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,166
(DOOR CLOSES)

1771
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,521
(GROANS)

1772
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,846
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1773
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,121
ONE SEC!

1774
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,690
GET YOUR KNEES
IN THERE.

1775
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,320
THERE YOU GO.

1776
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,120
HEY, NEIGHBOR.

1777
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,487
WHAT THE FUCK
DO YOU WANT, MAN?

1778
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,369
HI, HOW'S IT GOING?

1779
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,885
WHAT DO YOU WANT? IT'S OVER.
YEAH.

1780
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,604
YOU WON. THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE.

1781
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,727
WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

1782
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,723
I KNOW WHAT YOU
MIGHT BE THINKING.

1783
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,251
"TEDDY IS GONNA
GRADUATE THIS YEAR

1784
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,850
"AND EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE."

1785
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,921
BUT IT WON'T.

1786
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,446
BECAUSE IN A FEW WEEKS, WHEN SCHOOL
ENDS, SO DOES OUR PROBATION.

1787
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,007
THERE'S GONNA BE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF
TEDDYS LIVING NEXT DOOR TO YOU FOR ALL TIME.

1788
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,923
BECAUSE "TEDDY"
IS JUST AN IDEA.

1789
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,161
IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER, MAN.

1790
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,241
OKAY? IT'S DONE.

1791
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,606
IT'S OVER? OKAY, IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER.

1792
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,091
I JUST HAVE ONE
THING I WANTED TO SAY.

1793
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,084
THIS ENTIRE TIME, YOUR DAUGHTER
IS GONNA BE GROWING UP

1794
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,970
WATCHING ALL THESE YOUNG,
SHIRTLESS MEN NEXT DOOR,

1795
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,247
AND WE'RE GONNA BE
WATCHING RIGHT BACK.

1796
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,761
YOU'RE A BAD BOY!
GET OFF OUR PORCH.

1797
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,405
DELTA PSI, BITCH. NOW! I'M
GONNA CALL THE POLICE!

1798
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,481
GET OFF!

1799
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,607
WE ARE NOT MOVING.

1800
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,603
NO. THEY ARE.

1801
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,929
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THEY'RE ON PROBATION.

1802
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,161
I KNOW.
THEY'RE BEING CAREFUL.

1803
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,651
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
DO ANYTHING RIDICULOUS,

1804
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,211
BECAUSE THEY'RE
WATCHING THEMSELVES.

1805
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,727
WHAT WOULD BE GREAT IS IF THEY
DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE ON PROBATION.

1806
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,525
OUR PROBATION'S BEEN LIFTED!
OUR PROBATION'S BEEN LIFTED!

1807
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,211
OUR PROBATION'S BEEN LIFTED!

1808
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,005
YEAH, THIS IS AMAZING.

1809
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,367
I WANT A BABY.
I'M GONNA HAVE A BABY.

1810
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,409
YOU DON'T WANT A BABY.
OH, I DO.

1811
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,721
WOULD YOU BE
MY SURROGATE, KELLY?

1812
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,689
NO!
DUDE, DON'T ASK THAT.

1813
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,730
DON'T BE SO FUCKING OFFENDED. IT'S
NOT LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEX.

1814
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,330
I WOULD MASTURBATE INTO HER.
MAC: THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

1815
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,367
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU WOULD DO.

1816
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,720
(CELL PHONE CHIMES) I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

1817
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,847
OH, SHIT. TEDDY JUST TWEETED.

1818
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,291
WHAT?

1819
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,765
TOMORROW NIGHT, PARTY'S ON.

1820
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,321
FREE PARTY TONIGHT.

1821
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,687
THERE'LL BE FOOD, BLANKETS.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

1822
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,961
<I>(ON RADIO) WE'RE BACK ON

1824
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,889
<I>ROMIE: RIGHT, RIGHT.

1825
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,041
DIRTY BOY: <I>ALL RIGHT, CALLER,

1826
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,121

<I>ROMIE: WHAT'S UP, NUT SACK?</I>

1829
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,571
WE'RE HAVING
A HUGE RAGER TONIGHT.

1830
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,762
YOU KNOW WHAT BRINGS PEOPLE TO
A PARTY MORE THAN ANYTHING?

1831
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,167
CELEBRITIES.

1832
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,322
THIS IS MARK WAHLBERG. IF YOU
DON'T COME TO THIS PARTY,

1833
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,925
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A

01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,888
THAT WOULD BE A FUCKING DISASTER.
OH, JESUS.

2173
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,161
WE DID IT!

2174
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,605
WE DID IT.
WE FUCKING DID IT.

2175
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:18,761
WE DID IT.

2176
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,927
WE DID IT.
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

2177
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,281
COME ON.

2178
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,566
WE FUCKING DID THAT SHIT.

2179
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,529
WE TOTALLY DID IT.

2180
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,730
I THINK I WAS NEAR ONE OF
THOSE OIL DRUMS FOR TOO LONG.

2181
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,761
I THINK I MIGHT BE
REALLY QUITE STONED.

2182
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,001
ME, TOO.

2183
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,121
LIFE'S CRAZY.

2184
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,287
IT IS CRAZY.

2185
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,283
I MILKED YOU.

2186
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,603
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING,
AND I FUCKING MILKED YOU.

2187
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,729
WE MADE A BABY. THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.

2188
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,086
PART OF OUR LIFE IS
JUST TOTALLY OVER.

2189
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,406
YEAH.

2190
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,209
JUST GONE.
YEAH.

2191
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,169
IT'S NEVER COMING BACK.
NO.

2192
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,643
WE'LL NEVER NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SOMEONE UNTIL WE'RE SO, SO OLD.

2193
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,563
I THINK I LIKE OLD PEOPLE SHIT
BETTER THAN YOUNG PEOPLE SHIT NOW.

2194
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,801
I LOVE BRUNCH.

2195
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,041
OH, IT'S THE BEST!

2196
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,488
AND I GET REALLY EXCITED WHEN I
SMELL FRESHLY GROUND COFFEE.

2197
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,846
ME, TOO, BECAUSE
IT'S AWESOME.

2198
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,287
LIKE, WAY TOO EXCITED.

2199
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,442
I WANT A TOMATO GARDEN.
HOW'S THAT?

2200
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,729
I LOVE GOING TO THE CONTAINER
STORE AND BUYING CONTAINERS.

2201
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,881
ME, TOO.

2202
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,685
I LOVE OUR HAND SOAP
THAT'S SHAPED LIKE SEASHELLS.

2203
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,886
WHY?

2204
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,081
IT SMELLS LIKE LEMONGRASS.

2205
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,685
ME, TOO.

2206
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,041
DO YOU THINK
WE'LL BE GOOD PARENTS?

2207
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,964
I THINK WE'LL BE GOOD
AT IT AND BAD AT IT.

2208
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,487
BOTH: WHOA! (LAUGH)

2209
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,001
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE HAD STELLA, I
WAS AFRAID OF MISSING THE PARTY,

2210
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:40,402
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT WE ARE THE PARTY.

2211
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,088
THIS IS THE ONLY PARTY
I WANT TO BE AT.

2212
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,165
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY.

2213
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,611
DON'T CRY.

2214
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,091
OH, MY GOD.

2215
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,330
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

2216
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,522
I BROUGHT IT
INTO BED WITH US.

2217
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,163
I ALSO GOT SOME
RANCH DIPPING SAUCE.

2218
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,884
OH, MY GOD.
MMM-HMM.

2219
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,530
THAT'S THE BEST IDEA.

2220
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,806
YEAH.

2221
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,206
MMM!

2222
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,370
TEDDY: WELCOME

2223
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,643
COME INSIDE. CHECK OUT
SOME BOARD SHORTS.

2224
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,770

01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,485
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

2228
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,960
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE GUYS!

2229
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,280

IT'S A PRETTY GOOD GIG.

2231
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,527
YOU'D BE SURPRISED, I ACTUALLY
MEET A SHIT-TON OF GIRLS HERE.

2232
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,761
NOT THAT SURPRISED.

2233
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,251
YOUR BODY BASICALLY
LOOKS LIKE A GIANT ARROW

2234
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,731
POINTING RIGHT
TOWARDS YOUR DICK.

2235
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,768
OH, MY GOD. THANK YOU.
NO PROBLEM, MAN.

2236
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,808
I THINK THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
IT IS A COMPLIMENT.

2237
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,126
WE WENT NUTS.

2238
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,446
IT ESCALATED VERY QUICKLY.

2239
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,763
IT ESCALATED TO A REALLY CRAZY PLACE.
THAT WAS REALLY NUTS, MAN.

2240
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,850
HOW ARE THE GUYS?

2241
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,684
THEY'RE ALL GREAT. THEY GOT
A BIG HOUSE OFF CAMPUS.

2242
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,684
PETE'S A FANCY ARCHITECT,
DESIGNING BUILDINGS AND STUFF.

2243
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,206
HOW'S THE REST OF POST-COLLEGE
LIFE TREATING YOU?

2244
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,930
IT'S GOOD, MAN.
I'M HAVING FUN.

2245
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,844
I REALIZE I PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE STUDIED A LITTLE BIT MORE.

2246
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,251
LITTLE BIT. (LAUGHS)

2247
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,921
BUT I'M GOING TO NIGHT SCHOOL

2248
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,764

WELL, IT'S STILL
REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,841
GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO, BUDDY.

2251
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,001
ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.

2253
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,608
NICE, OKAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, DUDE.

2256
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,086
ALL RIGHT. WOW,

I'M DOING IT.
OH, MAN.

2258
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,731
SO, IS IT OUR POSTURE?
WHY DO WE LOOK SO DIFFERENT?

2259
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,881
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

2260
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,405
JUST KIND OF LET IT OUT.
OKAY.

I FEEL FREE.

2262
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,441

2271
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,607
