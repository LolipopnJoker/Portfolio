Kid?

1035
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:41,674
Lou?

1036
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:45,845
Oh, no.

1037
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:49,849
Scott :
Lou?

1038
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,656
Lou.

1039
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,747
Lou?

1040
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,874
Come on, Lou, wake up.

1041
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,128
You're not a loser, Lou.

1042
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,506
You're my best friend.

1043
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,177
Wake up.

1044
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,099
Lou :
And you're my best friend too.

1045
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:37,855
Lou?

1046
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,900
Lou? Lou!

1047
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,861
Mom, Dad, he's alive!

1048
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:49,033
Mom, Dad, he's alive!
Come quick!

1049
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,368
He came back!

1050
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:54,663
Peek : You have the right to--
SAM: You have the right...

1051
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:58,501
-...to remain silent.
-Anything you say can be used....

1052
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,503
Oh, my God!

1053
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,797
And the right to a dog attorney.

1054
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:04,632
Scott :
He's fine!

1055
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,592
Whoa!

1056
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,803
-Try this again.
-Athletic.

1057
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,596
Get it, Lou! Come on!

1058
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,640
Nice! You're getting good.

1059
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:13,974
Oh, no. Ow.

1060
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,893
Put your head forward.

1061
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,104
-Oh! Hey! Ooh!
-Ooh!

1062
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,648
All right, Dad!

1063
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,734
-Lou, go get it.
-That's a triple.

1064
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:25,402
Butch :
Hey, kid.

1065
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,780
Hey! Everything go okay at HQ?

1066
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,866
They're eating out of my paw.
How's things?

1067
01:20:31,075 --> 01:20:35,700
-Great. Want to play some ball?
-No, I gotta get back to work.

1068
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,790
Bring it here. Find the ball.

1069
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:47,215
Come on! Go get it! Come on!

1070
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,300
Professor Brody :
He's got it! He's got it!

1071
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:53,140
Bring that ball!
Bring that ball back!

1072
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,890
Butch :
He would've made a great agent.

1073
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:07,735
That's right, Mr. Tinkles.
You have been a very bad kitty.

1074
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:11,615
I'm just going to have to
teach you how to behave.

1075
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:18,040
Now you're going to have to live
with me and my sisters!

1076
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,000
Mr. Tinkles!!!

1077
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:29,550
Look what we made for you!

1078
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,510
Yes!

1079
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,060
-I could eat you with a spoon!
SiSTER 3: I can't take it!

1080
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,245
Mr. Tinkles :
This can't be happening.
