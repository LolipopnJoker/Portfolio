00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,261
**

2
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,371
* These are the days *

3
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,674
* Oh-oh *

4
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:53,887
* These are the days *

5
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:57,125
* You'll remember *

6
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,693
Good morning, Tom.
* Never before *

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,930
* And never since *

8
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,600
* I promise *

9
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:11,839
* Will the whole world
be warm as this *

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,208
Twelve is our number.
**

11
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:18,212
It's the number of games my husband Tom
coaches at Lincoln College every season.

12
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,250
It's the number of times we zero out our
bank account each year to make ends meet.

13
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,786
And it's the number of kids
we try to keep track of.

14
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,061
Hey. Good run?

15
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,930
Oh, yeah.

16
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,433
You need a paramedic?

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,803
No, just a pair of knees.
You finish?

18
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,540
Still proofing,
but I'm sending it to Diane today.

19
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,042
Look at this.
New, clean cover,

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,712
no peanut butter stains...
yet.

21
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,915
- Hey, baby?
- Baby?

22
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,985
You know, on the run,
you know what I was thinking?

23
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,621
What?

24
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,759
Well, we've been married,
what, five years?

25
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,529
Twenty-three.
Twenty-three. Sorry.

26
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,932
And I think we could use
a little change around here,

27
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:13,934
like-like this
lumpy old mattress.

28
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,837
Maybe we should just,
you know, get rid of it.

29
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:20,107
Don't be ridiculous, honey. You know you
can just pound the lumps out of a mattress.

30
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:23,611
What-What do you mean? You can just
pound the lumps out of a mattress?

31
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,113
Yeah, just randomly
start swatting away.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,182
And it goes flat?
Yes, yes.

33
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,951
Just start...
You just randomly start swatting...

34
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,754
* These are the days *

35
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:37,258
* You might fill with laughter *

36
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,293
Careful.
* Until you break *

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,130
* These are the days **

38
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,666
I got a dog on me!
Twelve's an insane number of kids,

39
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,069
but having a small family
was never an option for us.

40
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:53,841
See, Tom loved growing up
with seven brothers and sisters.

41
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,176
And after my sister died,
I spent most of my time...

42
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:59,480
wishing I had
seven brothers and sisters.

43
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,750
Tom and I met at
Illinois Polytechnic University.

44
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,454
He was a senior dreaming of becoming
the head football coach there.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,523
I was a freshman dreaming
of becoming a sports reporter.

46
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,826
He wanted eight kids,
I wanted eight kids. Bam.

47
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,330
An hour after I met him,
I knew he was the one.

48
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,366
We just had family
at the wedding.

49
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,968
Oh, and Shake Maguire,
Tom's best man.

50
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,137
What a hot dog.

51
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,640
A year later,
we had our first... Nora.

52
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,977
I loved taking her
to work with me.

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,980
After Charlie and Lorraine were born, we
realized our dream of living in the city...

54
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,717
and having eight kids and
two careers wasn't gonna work.

55
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:40,120
As much as we wanted our big careers,
we wanted our big family more.

56
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,591
So Tom settled for a Division
III coaching job at Lincoln,

57
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:47,295
I quit writing for the Tribune, and we moved
to the country. * Ninety-nine bottles of beer *

58
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,162
Tom and I got busy
when we moved to Midland.

59
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,567
We had Henry, Sarah,
Jake and Mark in consecutive years.

60
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,069
Then we went for magic number eight,
and instead...

61
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:59,807
we got the first set of fraternal twins...
Jessica and Kim.

62
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,610
Nine kids.
Come on, you guys. Come on.

63
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,612
Wave! Hi!

64
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:10,117
With each child, Tom and I got
further from our big career dreams.

65
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,185
But we didn't think about that.

66
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,290
Yeah!

67
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,659
Oh. Sorry, Coach.

68
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:27,768
We had our hands full with nine.
We were happy, and we were done.

69
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,304
Then we went to a party celebrating
Shake Maguire's appointment...

70
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,172
to athletic director
at our alma mater.

71
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,043
And, well, too many beers and
nine months later, we had Mike.

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,912
After that,
Tom got a vasectomy.

73
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,315
But he didn't hear the doctor say
that it would be a few weeks...

74
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,984
before the procedure
became effective.

75
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,722
In '98, Nigel and Kyle got us
to that crazy number 12.

76
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,326
But by then, Tom and I
were experts at managing chaos.

77
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,998
Let's move, gang.
Come on, come on, come on!

78
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:02,102
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! Charlie missed his
curfew again last night. Take care of that.

79
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,672
Hey.

80
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,575
You can only put on
so much lip gloss, princess!

81
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,277
You blew my concentration!
Temper, Sarah.

82
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,880
Now I get to start
all over again.

83
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,416
Wrap it up, Lorraine!
Okay, Daddy!

84
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,418
Have you seen my frog, Dad?

85
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,487
Sorry, Charlie.
Uh, Nigel. Kyle.

86
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,923
- It's Mark.
- I knew that.

87
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,862
Hey, teenager.
You got caught on Mom radar last night.

88
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,698
You're not gonna get that scholarship
if you're out late with Beth...

89
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,766
the night before a big game.

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,903
Well, I'm not so sure
I even want to go to college.

91
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,107
Since when?

92
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,343
Since Beth's mom offered me
a job at the auto shop.

93
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:45,278
Hmm. Sounds exciting.

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,181
Well, we'll talk about that
after you get your full ride.

95
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,151
And, meanwhile, in by 10:00
on school nights. Clear?

96
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,822
- Got it.
- Anything else you wanna talk about?

97
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,725
Did I mention
I don't like you very much?

98
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,194
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Then I'm good.

99
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:05,399
Okay, me too.

100
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,069
Dude, two words:
need new skates.

101
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:12,272
Dude, three words:
paper route.

102
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,477
"Hi. Can't make dinner.
Hank and I are moving into our new apartment.

103
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,579
Love, Nora."

104
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,649
Have you seen Beans, Mom?
Mm-mm.

105
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,886
Here you go, Gunner.
You hungry, boy?

106
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,388
**

107
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,961
* I think it's so wonderful *

108
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,329
* That people are bound
to get together *

109
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,634
* I think it's wonderful that
people are bound to get together *

110
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:45,673
* I think it's so good to know that
people are bound to get together *

111
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:50,878
* I think it's wonderful that
people are bound to get together *

112
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,913
**

113
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,182
Here you go, Gunner.
Are you hungry?

114
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,019
Look, I am totally aware that
this family doesn't value...

115
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,689
self-presentation in the same
obsessive way that I do.

116
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,025
Fine. Whatever.
But one of my life goals,

117
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,094
aside from being, like,
a fashion guru,

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,362
is to indicate to
the local community that...

119
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,699
the Baker family
actually owns a bar of soap.

120
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,102
So, as self-appointed in-house
rep of style and hygiene,

121
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,071
I think I should be allotted at least five
extra minutes in front of the mirror.

122
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,673
- Three.
- Done.

123
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,409
Now help your sister
butter the toast.

124
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:26,113
Sarah, your suspension from lacrosse
for excessive force has been lifted.

125
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,249
So you're going today.
Henry, you have band practice, all right?

126
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:32,520
I cleaned your clarinet. Please don't
play with food in your mouth again.

127
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,155
Kim and Jessica,
your teacher called and has made a request...

128
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,290
that you do not correct her
in front of the class.

129
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,660
Mike, you have show-and-tell today.
And, please, honey,

130
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,795
remember that body parts
do not count.

131
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,097
Kyle and Nigel, you have a dentist's appointment
at 3:00. You're goin' to work with Dad.

132
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,500
Yeah!

133
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,645
And we're shooting
our Christmas card today.

134
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,448
- What time's Nora coming over?
- Uh, she may not make it.

135
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,885
She hardly ever comes home since
she started dating that doorknob.

136
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,589
- He's not a doorknob.
- The man irons his jeans, Mom.

137
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,724
- Yeah, that's weird.
- Never mind.

138
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,560
I'll shoot it without her.
I'll Photoshop her in.

139
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,228
Honey, could you take 10 pounds
off me with that Photoshop thing?

140
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,497
Can I be Photoshopped in? Wait.
If Sarah's bein' Photoshopped in,

141
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,533
then I'm definitely gonna get
Photoshopped in. Why don't we all be...

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,170
Nobody gets Photoshopped in but Nora.
Everybody be here by 4:00.

143
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,172
Why do we always do our
Christmas cards in May anyway?

144
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,441
Because the earlier we get it done,
the bigger discount we get at the printer.

145
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,411
Now, let's eat!

146
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,547
Here you go.
Look alive.

147
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,534
No, Mark!

148
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,107
Get him!

149
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,948
Come on! Get him, Charlie!
He's headed for the waffles!

150
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,550
I got him, Charlie! I got him!
Come to Daddy! Come on!

151
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,959
Mike, stick!

152
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,895
- Mark, net!
- I got the door covered!

153
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,664
I got the net!

154
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,633
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

155
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,364
Uh-oh. Busted.

156
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,504
Put Beans in his cage...

157
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,074
now.

158
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,688
Is everything broken?

159
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,192
Teacup with
the flower on it broken?

160
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,127
Nice move, FedEx.

161
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:40,741
Okay, here we go, everyone.
School. Let's go.

162
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,882
Hey.

163
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,354
Much cooler.

164
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,356
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Henry, here you go. Thanks, Mom.

165
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,926
For the record,
I am so over Nora's hand-me-downs.

166
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,763
All right, well,
you look gorgeous in anything, Lorraine.

167
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's goin' on?
What's wrong with you, mister?

168
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,836
Everybody says
the FedEx guy dropped me off...

169
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,938
'cause I don't fit in
with this family.

170
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,741
You fit.
You fit right here.

171
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,910
Like that.
I called shotgun!

172
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,879
No, I did!
I did!

173
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,814
I did!
All right, that's it!

174
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,416
Hey, you two,
knock it off!

175
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,518
Mom's losing it!
I'm losing it!

176
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,856
All right. All right. Come on.
Break it up. Break it up.

177
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,126
Here we go. Are you okay?
I'll give you candy.

178
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,397
- Nigel, Kyle, chill or be chilled.
- Sure. Listen to him.

179
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,200
Mark? Oh.

180
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:49,042
So Nora's not coming?
Well, not exactly. Here.

181
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,946
That is so Nora.
We tell 'em they can't sleep together...

182
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,182
when they visit,
so she moves in with him.

183
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,217
Honey, she's just trying
to have her own life.

184
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,186
She's too young to have her own life.
She's 22.

185
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,823
The same age I was
when I was pregnant with her.

186
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,758
Five minutes ago, she was
sitting on my shoulders...

187
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,994
pointing at cows
in Munger's Field.

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,096
And then you blinked.
Yeah.

189
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,899
Enough with the blinking.
No more blinking. All right.

190
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,671
You were checking me out,
weren't you?

191
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,208
Yes, I was.
You got a problem with that?

192
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:24,377
Twelve kids later,
and we still got the heat.

193
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,747
Whoo!

194
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:35,022
**

195
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,224
**

196
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,698
Come on! Hit it!

197
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,968
Faster, faster, faster!

198
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,370
Is that as fast as you can go?
Is that all you got?

199
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,672
Pump 'em high!
Pump 'em high! Let's go!

200
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,674
Pump it up! That's good!
That's good!

201
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,845
**

202
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,948
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Way to go, Marcus.

203
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:04,451
Way to go, boys!
Nice passes.

204
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,188
Right here.
Nice job!

205
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,193
Man, you're gettin'
old and ugly.

206
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,729
Shake.

207
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,632
Hey.

208
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,634
Hey, what are you
doin' here?

209
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,839
What, are you still too busy bein' the
pansy house-husband to read the newspapers?

210
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,477
That coach was 5-3.

211
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,712
That's doesn't cut it.
I'm trying to grow a program.

212
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,317
Hey, guys. Remember Shake?
We played college ball together.

213
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,586
Yeah, the hot dog.

214
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,288
Mom said it first.

215
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,690
We're having
adult time here, boys.

216
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,059
No idea what that means.

217
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,528
Well, it's this crazy thing
where grown-ups...

218
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,331
actually get to have a conversation
without being interrupted by kids.

219
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,833
Sounds wicked boring.
It is.

220
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,136
So why don't you run along?

221
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,906
Mom's right.
He is a wiener.

222
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,808
Sorry about that. Kate likes you.
It's just that, you know,

223
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,977
she had to have the biggest
stud on the team.

224
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,479
So she, uh, chose
the third-string receiver...

225
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,648
and got all this.

226
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,884
Yeah.

227
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,186
So, are you gonna
tell me why you're here?

228
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,990
Lincoln's a winning machine.

229
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,392
You think you can make
our old team a champion again?

230
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:24,197
- You mean coach?
- Coach.

231
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,771
Tom, what is it?
Just tell me.

232
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,941
Just...
Okay. Wait.

233
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,212
Dad's covering
with the machines.

234
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,881
To the chute!
Go, go, go!

235
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,185
My, this is big.

236
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,620
Shake Maguire wants me
to coach the Stallions.

237
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,357
Get out!
He offered me...

238
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,760
a fat five-year contract,
housing allowance, moving expenses.

239
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,496
Kate, we can finally get new furniture.
We can get a new car.

240
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:00,233
And get this. University employees can
send their kids to school for free.

241
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,371
Wow.

242
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,942
Oh. I don't know, honey.
A Division I coaching job,

243
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,011
that's a lot of pressure
and a lot more hours.

244
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,614
Yeah, but with all the kids in school next
year, we could handle more job pressure.

245
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:18,351
Yeah, but, honey, Midland is our home.
I mean, the kids' lives are here.

246
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,655
Midland has been great
for raising our kids,

247
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,858
but I never expected 'em
to sacrifice the way that I did.

248
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,228
You loved your childhood.

249
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,197
Yeah.

250
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,066
Except for this part...
the raggedy, hand-me-down part.

251
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,368
The Stallions head coach.

252
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,238
It's your dream job,
isn't it, honey?

253
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,142
I want this one, Kate.

254
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,244
Let's talk to the kids.

255
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,779
How do you think
they'll handle it?

256
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,782
We're gonna move!

257
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,421
Okay, everybody,
you know the drill.

258
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,523
On "three,"
you give me a big "cheese."

259
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,929
Jake, do you have
to wear black?

260
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:06,099
Black works, Mom. Jesus, like,
has his funeral on Christmas.

261
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,935
- He died on Easter, Barbie.
- Whatever.

262
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,104
He was resurrected
on Easter, moron.

263
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,140
Be quiet.
Don't touch me!

264
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:17,444
Hey, hey, hey!
What's all the fighting about?

265
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,380
Exactly when did you plan
on telling us about moving?

266
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,616
I'm not moving!
Yeah, because I'm not moving, all right?

267
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,657
- I'm not moving.
- Charlie, Evanston is only four hours away.

268
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,992
- Beth can come and visit.
- This isn't just about Beth, Mom.

269
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,530
My whole life
is here at Midland.

270
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,599
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

271
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,603
Hi, Nora. You're on speaker.
Hi, everybody.

272
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,075
Hank says hi too. So,
you guys are thinking about moving up here?

273
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,743
Yeah. You got room in that new
apartment for your big old family?

274
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,781
Just big enough for two, Dad.
How's your book going, Mom?

275
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,950
Actually, I just sent it to a friend
who's in publishing, so we'll see.

276
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,987
- Could we stay on subject, please?
- Beans's mother's buried here.

277
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm not splitting them up.
They're family.

278
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,226
We can build a fancy new memorial
to Pork in our new yard.

279
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,596
- Yeah, like we could afford that.
- Actually, we can.

280
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,366
I'll be making enough money to do that,
get you out of hand-me-downs,

281
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,969
get Jake those new skates,
and get that new car we've been saving for.

282
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,607
- But I have friends here!
- Honey, you'll keep in touch. And you can make new friends.

283
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,980
Quiet!

284
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,350
Now, look,
I know you're all scared.

285
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:33,853
Moving is a big deal.
We're very comfortable here. I get that.

286
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,290
And that's why I turned down a lot of
other coaching offers through the years.

287
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,395
But this is a job
I wanted since we left Chicago.

288
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,598
And, in fact,
it's more than a job to me.

289
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,034
Um, this is my team...

290
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:51,104
and it's my colors
and it's, um,

291
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,573
the Stallions.

292
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,809
And they're finally
calling my number.

293
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:00,980
And I want you to take this risk with me,
because if you do...

294
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,183
I promise you,
we will be...

295
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,719
a happier and stronger family.

296
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,990
- You promise?
- I promise.

297
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,761
I would feel happier and stronger
if we vote on it. Yeah, definitely.

298
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,796
We should vote.

299
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,931
That's the only way to make it fair.
It's the only way to do it.

300
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,234
All right, we can vote.

301
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:24,337
But in the end, your mother and I are gonna
do what we think is best for the family.

302
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,207
- What's the point of even voting?
- I'm out.

303
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,843
- Let's get out of here. It's not even worth it.
- Come on, guys.

304
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,351
Hello? Still here.

305
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:42,455
All right, eight noes,

306
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,425
three yes's
and three maybes.

307
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,760
Not exactly a mandate.

308
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,463
Give me a pen.
I'm gonna change some of these.

309
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,966
Here we go.

310
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,369
What?
"What"?

311
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,505
Let's review, shall we?

312
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,208
Here we go.

313
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:05,044
"I'm so glad I found someone
whose dreams are as big as mine.

314
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,347
I love you. Kate."

315
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:12,419
I always loved the way
you go for things, Tom.

316
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,954
Pedal to the metal, full-on,
all of it or none of it.

317
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,889
So we're doing this.

318
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,194
We're gonna do this.

319
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,834
We're doing it.

320
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,272
Yeah. And by the time we move,
the kids'll get used to the idea.

321
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,507
**

322
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,820
Say good-bye
to your mother, Beans.

323
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,400
Gunner, to the car!

324
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,469
Come on!

325
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,671
I'm you.
Gunner, to the car!

326
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,774
I'm Gunner.
Gunner, to the car!

327
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:12,445
Hey, Charlie. Do me a favor
and drive the Cutlass?

328
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,283
Thanks for ruining my life.

329
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,017
I don't wanna move!

330
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,986
You know what?
Everybody's going with us.

331
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,822
We're taking all your toys.
Okay.

332
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,959
Well, whoever said expressing emotion
is a good thing, I'd like to see.

333
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,396
**

334
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,649
* Life is a highway *

335
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:53,853
* I wanna ride it
all night long *

336
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,858
* If you're goin' my way *

337
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:03,496
* I wanna drive it
all night long **

338
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,534
Hey, this is our street.

339
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,269
**

340
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,208
Are you sure we're gonna
fit in here, Dad?

341
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,311
You'll have friends here
in no time, guys.

342
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,458
Here we are. We are here.
Everybody out.

343
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,593
I want everybody out.

344
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,930
Hey, slow down there,
Gunner!

345
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:42,335
Wait up!
Hey, Kyle, check this place out!

346
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:45,271
Cool!

347
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,674
There it is...
a 1920s classic.

348
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,576
What, did the Munsters
give you a good price?

349
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,845
All right, the twins share,
but everybody else gets their own room.

350
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,749
Now, go kill each other for the best one!
That's great.

351
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,789
Hey, Charlie.

352
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:06,593
You're gonna need a car to visit Beth.
The Olds is yours now.

353
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,333
You trying to bribe me?

354
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,503
Is it working?

355
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,739
Little bit.

356
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,111
Come on.

357
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,856
Welcome home, Kate.

358
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,927
It's gonna be great, Tom.
Mmm.

359
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,995
Jessica, come here!
Check this out!

360
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,097
This room is huge!
Can I see this one?

361
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,999
Whoa-ho!
Back it up, FedEx.

362
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,769
If anyone gets the room
across from me, it's Charlie.

363
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,338
And are you Charlie? No.
Dude, I call this room.

364
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,974
Nobody else gets it, okay?
Look at the view from here!

365
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,777
It's spectacular!
Can I share with you?

366
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,446
Oh, God.
They're fast-food people.

367
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,282
Hello?

368
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,117
People are here!

369
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,420
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Tina Shenk.

370
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,355
This is my husband Bill
and our son Dylan.

371
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,725
- How do you do?
- We, uh, live across the street.

372
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,761
Thank you. This is lovely.
I'm Kate. This is Tom. Hi.

373
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,530
- We're the Bakers.
- Oh!

374
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,298
Gunner! Gunner!
I am so sorry.

375
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,034
Sorry. Are you hiding a cheeseburger
anywhere on your person?

376
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:58,771
I-I don't eat meat.

377
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:02,074
Jake?
Dude! Two words: manners.

378
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:05,545
- What's up? Wanna help me unpack?
- Sure.

379
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,014
Put your sweater on, sweetie.
He's inside, dear.

380
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,982
Don't start, okay?

381
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,288
So, uh, is Jake
your only child?

382
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,224
No. We have 12.

383
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,661
I couldn't
keep her off me.

384
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,566
- Heads up!
- Oh!

385
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,136
- Little less wrist, Mike.
- Got it.

386
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,439
Game on!
Uh, they're playing hockey in the house?

387
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,543
Well, if the game gets bigger than
three-on-three, then they have to take it outside.

388
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,549
Uh, Dylan doesn't really
care for rough play.

389
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:46,919
Uh, you're gonna wanna
stop now, dude.

390
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,889
Oh, my God!

391
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,091
Hang on, buddy!
A little help here!

392
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,294
- I got him! I got him!
- Save my baby!

393
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:58,064
Don't worry, Dylan.
I swing from the chandelier all the time.

394
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,733
Cool!
All right.

395
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,170
Aah! I got him! I...
Oh! I don't got him!

396
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,707
Oh, my God!

397
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,044
So, Dylan,
know any good restaurants?

398
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,181
I've got you, Dylan!
Don't worry, honey!

399
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:22,354
- Whoa!
- You can let go, Dylan. I think she's got you.

400
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:25,592
- Spin him this way so I can...
- Oh, my God!

401
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:32,164
Oh, sweetie, are you all right?
I'm fine, Mom.

402
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:36,268
Oh, dear. You know, for the entire
minute and a half we lived here,

403
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,204
I really hated
that chandelier.

404
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,872
Here we go.

405
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,675
Okay. We, uh... We better go.
It's time for your chess lesson.

406
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,744
I don't have
a chess lesson, Mom.

407
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,613
Well, then, you need to practice
for your chess lesson.

408
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,748
Come over anytime, dude.

409
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:51,383
Uh, we'll, uh, we'll call,
schedule a play date.

410
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,552
No need.
Just come by anytime.

411
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,255
Oh, no, we'll call.

412
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:59,926
- You're all invited to my birthday.
- Oh-ho. That'll be fun.

413
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,128
Hey, Charlie, come on down
and help me with this, okay?

414
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,064
Careful, honey.
There's glass everywhere.

415
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,402
I got it, Mom.
Okay, well, I'll help you.

416
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,039
Hey, Shake, what's up?
You okay?

417
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,709
Really?

418
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,178
Okay, well,
I'll see you there.

419
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,716
Hey! Hey, guess what?
Fox Sports wants to interview me on TV!

420
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,053
- Okay, well, we got this.
- Dad's gotta earn a living!

421
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,622
Twelve kids.
That's the throwback.

422
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,658
Irresponsible is what it is.

423
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,826
How come we didn't
have more kids?

424
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,762
Because we wanted
one perfect child,

425
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,930
and that's what we got.

426
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,894
Cool.

427
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,797
Honey, I'm gonna be home late tonight.
I got another press conference.

428
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,065
Come on.
Whatever happened to that stud...

429
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,467
who sat across from me
at dinner every night?

430
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,770
He got his dream job,
remember?

431
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,750
Good-bye, Dad.
See ya, buddy.

432
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,596
Tell the masseuse I'm running
about 15 minutes late.

433
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,701
Day 14 on the alien planet.
Where you goin'?

434
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:53,172
To sign up for football.
And, no, you can't come.

435
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,443
Could this place be
any more boring?

436
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,213
There's, like, nothing to do around here.
I could give you a makeover.

437
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,684
All righty, then.

438
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,597
Hi.
I'm Charlie Baker.

439
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,466
Oh, yeah, Tom Baker's boy.

440
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,436
Read where his old buddy Shake
threw him a bone.

441
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,305
Offense or defense?

442
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,278
I'm a quarterback.

443
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,680
Yeah, well,
maybe in Cowpie, Illinois.

444
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:38,150
This is 4-A, Skippy.
The bigs.

445
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,887
Put him on defense.
Cornerback.

446
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,093
By the way, when you show up for practice,
don't be wearing that hat.

447
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:55,734
Okay, uh, let's see.
Who's next? Yes?

448
00:28:55,802 --> 00:29:00,039
It's been reported that you like to
blast music in your locker room. Why?

449
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,574
Uh, well,
it loosens up the players...

450
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,376
and, uh,
gets 'em psyched.

451
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,379
Unless, of course, I start dancing.
Then they just get nauseous.

452
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,183
At least we get
to see him on TV.

453
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,252
Coach, how do you manage
a family of 12...

454
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,254
and a football team?

455
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,256
Well, I've got
a great team here...

456
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:20,059
and a solid support system
at home.

457
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:23,195
- Go to bed, kids.
- Okay, you heard the coach.

458
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,264
Off to bed. Here we go.

459
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:28,334
In Midland, we were a family.
Now we're a support system?

460
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,370
A family is
a support system, Butch.

461
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:38,510
Hello? Who's this?

462
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:41,113
- Somebody from something something.
- Okay. Shh.

463
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,017
Hello?
Yeah, hi, Diane.

464
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,263
This is business.
Salmons and pinks are so homemaker.

465
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,565
All right, focus on
your navies and your grays.

466
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,369
Navy is muscle, gray is smarts.
Choose either, and you'll rule the boardroom.

467
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,839
What's going on?
Guess what?

468
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:10,209
Diane Phillips called.
My book's getting published.

469
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,311
Did I tell you
we're gonna have it all?

470
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,681
- You've never said that.
- I'm tellin' you now, baby! Whoo!

471
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,984
Oh-oh.
Oh!

472
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,785
Oh! Whoa!
Mmm!

473
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,653
Ooh!

474
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,858
Oh, my God! Can you guys just
please wait till I leave the room?

475
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,860
Can you hurry?

476
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:31,430
All right, there's one thing.
What?

477
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,233
They asked me to go
to New York for a few days.

478
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,638
Oh.
"Oh"?

479
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:42,841
That was a good "oh,"
as in "okay."

480
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,444
Yes, it's not
the best timing in the world.

481
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,180
- But you're going to New York. I can handle this.
- You'll manage.

482
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,681
Yeah.

483
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,885
Well, you haven't been home much,
Tom, since we moved here.

484
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,057
And you're gonna have to, you know,
shop for school supplies,

485
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:00,326
get 'em dressed
and-and bathed so they're clean,

486
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,995
and put 'em to bed at night, walk Gunner...
Been there. Done all that.

487
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,533
- You're considering this?
- I'm not considering it.

488
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,336
You're going.
Nora can help me out around the house.

489
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,207
New York. Wow.

490
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,709
Yeah. Wow.

491
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:22,081
* Every once in a while *

492
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,485
* I carve a pumpkin *

493
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:32,391
* With a knife made
of lollipop sticks *

494
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,660
It totally sucks.
I miss you too,

495
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,595
but, I mean,
I gotta get a job.

496
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,697
Hi, Lorraine.

497
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,799
Okay, I'll try
and be there, honey.

498
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:45,237
Hi, Kimmy. Yeah, I-I know I haven't
been very friendly recently.

499
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,239
They are pulling me
in again!

500
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,276
Just tell 'em you can't do it.
Can you guys hold on a second?

501
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,412
That's easy for you to say.
You're an only child.

502
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,887
It might be fun
to babysit together.

503
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,190
No! Whoa, no!

504
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,492
No. You know what happened
last time we visited.

505
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,529
They were welcoming you into the family.
They set me on fire!

506
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,499
Just your pants.

507
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:17,169
Honey, I am an actor, okay?
And, sure, last time it was just my pants.

508
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,771
But what if next time
it's my face?

509
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:23,175
This is the moneymaker.
I'm not that good of an actor.

510
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,177
This is how I get the jobs.
I know that.

511
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,546
I'm man enough to admit it.

512
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,848
Please?

513
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:32,584
Don't look at me like that. Don't look at me
like that! Please, please, please, please?

514
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,521
You always do that to me.
Fine, fine. You know what? We'll go.

515
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,689
But I'll tell you what.
One thing happens, and I'm gone.

516
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:41,760
And no fires.
And we sleep in the same room.

517
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,662
Kimmy, put Dad on.

518
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,899
She says she'll help us out if
they can stay in the same room.

519
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,702
No. No way.

520
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:53,872
No, she knows the rules. She wants to
have her own room when she's here.

521
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,808
Isn't that sweet?
No.

522
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:01,513
Okay, look, why don't you just come over
on Sunday, and we'll talk logistics.

523
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,051
- All right. Bye.
- Tell me Doorknob Man isn't babysitting too.

524
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,419
Yes, he very well
might be, young lady.

525
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,688
And do not set
his pants on fire again.

526
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:11,190
Yes.
Classic.

527
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,561
It was just his pants.

528
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,397
Is anybody besides me thinking
our happier and stronger life...

529
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,866
was actually code
for "nastier and suckier"?

530
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,569
First, Dad forces us
to move.

531
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,705
Then Mom decides to become a career
person and, like, travel the globe.

532
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,341
Now we have to take orders
from Hank, the model/actor?

533
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:32,911
- And he hates kids too.
- Ow!

534
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:36,615
Nora's blind to his evil.
We have no choice but to intervene.

535
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:40,419
We've got 48 hours.
Let's work a plan.

536
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:49,461
All right, Appleschmear season
is officially open!

537
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,799
The president of the United States,
Sarah Baker,

538
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,801
will throw out
the first apple.

539
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:02,774
Come on. Bring on the chin music, baby.
Let's go. Let's go.

540
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,445
Let's go. Oh, yes!

541
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,316
Ho, it's an apple!
And now it's sauce.

542
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:16,088
And that's a beauty!
Mmm! Mmm!

543
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,660
Whoa!

544
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:26,732
Appleschmear. It's the game my
Great-Grandma Gilbreth invented.

545
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,800
Neat.

546
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,238
Time out.
Nora's here.

547
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:38,477
- Nora! Nora!
- No! No, no, no, no!

548
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,313
Kids, please do not touch the LeBaron.
Just had it detailed.

549
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,049
Hey, whoa, Tom.
Tom, can we please, uh,

550
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,918
ask the kids to respect the
perimeter around the LeBaron?

551
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:49,288
Hey, hey, respect the perimeter, kids.
Come on. Respect...

552
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:52,158
Back up. Back up.
Nora. Nora, welcome.

553
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:55,093
Come on.
It's a luxury automobile, kids.

554
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,596
Not your daddy's Oldsmobile.
This is for you. Congratulations.

555
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,598
Come on.
I wanna hear all about it.

556
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:01,700
It's very fancy.
Now, about the babysitting.

557
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,602
Battle stations.

558
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,735
Heads up, Hank!

559
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,473
Yo, Hank!

560
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:51,250
Phase one complete.

561
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,998
Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We'll have 'em dry in no time.

562
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:11,169
"Sorry about your clothes, Hank.
We'll have 'em dry in no time."

563
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,682
What is with the staring?
Just stop looking at me.

564
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,521
Chopsticks.

565
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,403
Open meat bucket.

566
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,375
Oh!

567
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,678
Begin underwear soaking.

568
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:02,488
So, um,
how's the acting career going, Hank?

569
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,824
If it was goin' any better,
there'd have to be two of me.

570
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,560
Yeah, we saw you in the commercial
with the gargling... the mouthwash ad.

571
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,629
You know,
the remarkable thing about my career is...

572
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:13,198
I only started acting, uh,
a month ago,

573
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:15,133
and, uh,
I'm already on TV.

574
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,705
It's the real deal.
The career is white hot, Tom. It's on fire.

575
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,841
I read that most actors end up
in the food service industry.

576
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,647
That's not gonna happen
to Hank, Kim.

577
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,283
Candidly, I, uh, think
Nora's right.

578
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,019
It's really... It's gettin'
so as I can hardly go out in public anymore.

579
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:38,089
I mean, really, with... between the
autograph hounds and the paparazzis...

580
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,826
Autographs and everything?
I mean, just the one commercial,

581
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,728
and you have paparazzi?

582
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,564
Yeah. I've-I've actually...
I've never actually seen them,

583
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:49,267
but, you know, they hide in the
bush and they get their shot.

584
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:54,773
The crazy thing is that now we're trying
to sit at home like regular joes...

585
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,643
Yeah, well, honey, it's...
And we're watching TV, right?

586
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,512
And, boom, comes on a commercial,
and, bam, there's me.

587
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,548
It's, like,
you expect to see yourself in the mirror,

588
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,116
you know, and you expect to be lookin'
at the handsome devil,

589
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,319
but not on...
not on the TV like it is.

590
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,655
It's, like, bam! Bam!
You turn the channel. You're tryin' to,

591
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,958
you know, get it out, and it's...
it just keeps poppin' up.

592
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,794
It's like I can run from me,
but I can't hide from me.

593
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,997
What a nightmare!

594
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,634
Yeah.

595
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,005
Nora, honey, you wanna
help me in the kitchen?

596
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,477
Nora, stop!
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

597
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,780
Wanna help me in the kitchen? Get a pie,
look at a picture of Grandma, say the rosary?

598
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,783
Come on, kids. Here we go.
Everybody out. I'll be back.

599
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,358
Tommy.
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

600
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:55,333
Gunner!

601
00:38:57,235 --> 00:39:00,472
Save it, boy.

602
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:02,841
Hey!
Hey.

603
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,876
There you go.
You look as good as new.

604
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:08,714
Yeah. Not as good as you, chief.
Yeah, anywhere.

605
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,819
How sweet.
You know what you want?

606
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,888
Kate, is this...
is this orange juice freshly squeezed?

607
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,591
Nora and I are on
a bit of an organic diet,

608
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,493
and we're only goin' with
the organic freshly squeezed,

609
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,129
and it tastes a bit
like Tropicana.

610
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,565
He's a winner.

611
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:29,401
Gunner, no!

612
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,269
Release the hound.

613
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,804
All right, charge!

614
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,841
You guys poppin' out
another one any time soon?

615
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,011
Just... curiosity.

616
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,559
Gunner!

617
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,461
Gunner!
Gunner!

618
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,395
It's Gunner.

619
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:00,532
Honey, he's...
he's really digging in.

620
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,401
Sorry, babe. Gunner, stop!
Sit-Sit down!

621
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,036
He's attacking!
Stop it, Gunner.

622
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,508
Oh, my. Well, he's hungry.
Stop it, Gunner!

623
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,047
Gunner!

624
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:19,250
Get him off!
Get him off!

625
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,647
Nora! Nora, we didn't
want you to go.

626
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,749
Look, let's just get
something clear.

627
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:53,752
Even though you guys live near me now,
I have my own life.

628
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,888
It's mine.
Not ours... mine.

629
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,391
Nora! Would you please
get in the LeBaron?

630
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,429
I beg of you!
My loyalty is to Hank now,

631
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,465
and that's the way
it's gonna be.

632
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,636
In the living room,
now!

633
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,572
Let's go!

634
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,679
Your neighborhood canines have completely
ruined the LeBaron's paint job.

635
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,748
I'm sure my family
will pay to repaint it.

636
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,116
Good, 'cause I'm sure
payin' for your family.

637
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,953
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I think you know what it means.

638
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:33,525
You soaked his underwear
in meat.

639
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:37,095
That is so wrong.

640
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:42,000
Funny, but wrong.

641
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:46,805
Now, who was
the mastermind...

642
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,775
in the meat-soaking plot
against Hank?

643
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,751
You were the masterminds?

644
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,990
Step back, please.

645
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,355
You have a dark gift,
Sarah Baker.

646
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,691
But it's going to cost
everyone a month's allowance.

647
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,961
Do you wanna make it two?

648
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,799
Now, when your mother
leaves tomorrow,

649
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,868
I'm gonna need everyone
to pull their own weight.

650
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,270
Now, go upstairs
and go to your rooms!

651
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,679
Soaking his underwear in meat?

652
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,781
I mean,
how do they come up with that?

653
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:06,952
If I could just harness that ingenuity and
channel it into something constructive.

654
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,520
Yeah, like getting somebody to
help you out while I'm gone.

655
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,891
I can handle it,
even without the better half of the tag team.

656
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,126
I know, honey. I'm just worried.
I've never left the kids...

657
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:18,363
Honey, it's three days!
I know.

658
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,465
I'm just...
I'm gonna miss 'em.

659
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,268
Okay, I froze some dinners.
And make sure they get to school on time.

660
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,704
It's their first day, so you know how
nervous they're gonna be, all right?

661
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:28,373
And, kids, don't worry. Mom can be back from
New York in two hours if something happens.

662
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,809
Really, it's only one hour
with the time difference.

663
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:33,945
All right, I hugged everybody. I love you
all. One more hug, and you guys pass it on.

664
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,047
All right? All right,
thank you, sweetheart.

665
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,183
I love you.
I love you too.

666
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,386
Okay. All right. Do I have everything?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

667
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,488
All right.

668
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,623
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

669
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:47,859
I love you.
Yeah, yeah.

670
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,796
Have a safe flight.

671
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:54,099
Got the whole neighborhood
out to say good-bye, huh?

672
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,936
Bye, Mom!

673
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:04,009
Little vampires,
my plan worked.

674
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:07,278
She's gone. Now I can raise you
children the way I want to!

675
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,085
Come on. It's gonna be fun.
I mean, your dream has come true.

676
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,187
Mom's gone.
Weak old Dad is here.

677
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:18,857
You can get away with murder.
You can do anything you want.

678
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:21,727
Dylan's birthday party
is coming up.

679
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:27,265
You can get all hopped up on ice cream
and sugar and cake and go crazy.

680
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,901
* I'm just a kid *

681
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,773
You kids are gonna
do great today, I promise.

682
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:39,811
* I'm just a kid
and life is a nightmare *

683
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:44,615
* I'm just a kid
I know that's not fair *

684
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,652
* Nobody cares
'cause I'm alone *

685
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:51,422
* And the world
is having more fun *

686
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,925
* Than me *

687
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,862
**
What is that?

688
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,033
Moo!

689
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:07,205
I guess he's the funniest
guy in the herd.

690
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,744
* Here it goes
I'm just a kid *

691
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,814
* Life is a nightmare *

692
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:19,617
* I'm just a kid
I know that it's not fair *

693
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:22,087
**

694
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:25,223
Walk much?

695
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:32,097
* Nobody cares 'cause
I'm alone and the world *

696
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:36,467
* Is having more fun
than me *

697
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:40,806
* I'm just a kid
and life is a nightmare **

698
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,645
Hi!
Hey!

699
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:51,616
Look at you, Diane. Look at you.
You did not have 12 kids.

700
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,019
Yes, I did.
Girl, I can't even manage a boyfriend.

701
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,721
Well, who can? Look at this room!
Oh, it's great.

702
00:45:56,788 --> 00:46:00,691
Isn't it great?
Listen, we've got big plans for the book.

703
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,760
Really? I'm so...
Ta-da!

704
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:04,629
Oh, come on!
Look at it!

705
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,233
Isn't it great? It's fantastic.
I love it. Look at this.

706
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,836
The company wants it
in stores by Christmas.

707
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:12,770
Christmas?
Yes. So, tomorrow,

708
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:15,306
the marketing people will bring
you up to speed on the book tour.

709
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:19,310
A-A book tour? Yes.
We've got talk shows,

710
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,412
book signings,
personal appearances.

711
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,514
And it's only gonna take
a couple of weeks.

712
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:27,853
Couple of weeks? Oh, no.
I can't be away from the kids that long.

713
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,924
Well, if there's no book tour,
then there's no book.

714
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,527
Two weeks?
Kate,

715
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:39,664
you've been the primary caregiver for,
what, 22 years?

716
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,933
Can't Tom handle the kids
for a while?

717
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,836
**

718
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,046
**

719
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:57,248
They're all going to end up
on milk cartons.

720
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,263
Gil... Gil, Decker and Rico are
playing too loose at the corners.

721
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,432
We need to pull them in.

722
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,969
Sarah, dishwasher! I'll-I'll come by tomorrow
after I drop the kids off at school,

723
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:20,138
and we can talk out
some offense variations.

724
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,873
All right. No, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

725
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,945
Dad, Nigel hit Kim with a dart,
and I assume he will be punished.

726
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,980
Uh, Jake, get me a Band-Aid, okay?
Here, here.

727
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,949
Go stir. You like to stir.
Here, let's take a look at it.

728
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,783
Let's take a look,
see if it's okay.

729
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,121
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.
It's actually not... Uh, Dad?

730
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,489
- Yeah?
- This goo's on fire.

731
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:43,061
Oh, no, no. That's the way Daddy likes it!
Likes it hot and nice and spicy!

732
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:47,265
Yeah. Here we go. There we go.
Got it. All right.

733
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:49,935
Hey, Dad. Oh, good.
Can you get a Band-Aid?

734
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:53,404
No need to say hello. Not one other
kid in this neighborhood does chores.

735
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,806
Well, we're not like any other
family in the neighborhood.

736
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,743
Right. So,
why do we live here?

737
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,578
Dishwasher, now!

738
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:04,315
Jessica, can you get these plates and put
'em on the table, please?

739
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:08,353
Oh, God. What the...
Mike's athletic cup?

740
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,221
Ow!

741
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:14,392
Oh!
Pasta de la Crotch.

742
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,733
- Is that blood?
- No, it's just a...

743
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:30,942
Oh! Clean-up on aisle 12!
Anybody?

744
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:34,079
You need help
cleaning up, Dad?

745
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,515
- I'm in puke!
- Are you all right?

746
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,552
- Still need help cleaning up?
- No, you mopped it up enough with your back.

747
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:47,658
Oh, disgusting!
Where's the Band-Aid?

748
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:51,262
- Dad, it still hurts.
- Oh, here, let me look. Let me look.

749
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,664
Nora, where's that Band...

750
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:56,401
Jake put a bucket on Jessica's head,
and it's stuck.

751
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,336
And when they have a free moment,
let my parents know that...

752
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,938
I came by to tell
'em I got a job today at an ad agency.

753
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:04,275
Nora... Nora!

754
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:09,280
Dad, a little help here!
Nora!

755
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,649
Nora!

756
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:17,355
Are you all right?

757
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:19,890
You are in over your head, mister!
I'm so sorry.

758
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,527
I mean, I will... I will call...
It's just my wife is out of town.

759
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,729
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

760
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,766
Dad, can I kill Jake now?
No, you finish washing the car first.

761
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:31,569
Dad, can you get this Band-Aid on me?
Yes, yes. Come on. Come on.

762
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:34,472
Let's go. Okay, come on.
Everything will be all right. Oh, Jake?

763
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,275
Give me the Band-Aid. That's the last
time you put a bucket on my head!

764
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,377
Does that hurt? Okay, good.

765
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:42,313
There it is.
All right, good. Good.

766
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,482
Hey, Nigel, wanna play darts?

767
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:47,385
No! No playing darts!
I told you that!

768
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,921
- Hello?
- Hi. How's it goin'?

769
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,324
Oh, everything's fine. I'm just, uh...
I'm just here. I'm just, uh, making dinner.

770
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:56,161
- Yeah.
- Dad, check me out!

771
00:49:56,227 --> 00:50:00,065
- Isn't this awesome?
- How are you?

772
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,832
Good, I guess.
Sorry, Dad!

773
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,102
I mean, it's kind of weird
having all this free time.

774
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:07,838
You sure everything's all right, honey?
Oh, honey, everything's fine.

775
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,108
I can handle it.

776
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:13,211
All right, you know, I'm just used
to tag-teaming to manage the mob.

777
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:15,813
So I thought... Oh, no.
They're like kittens.

778
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,882
Whoa!
Sorry, Dad!

779
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:21,586
Uh, well, this might be a good time then
to talk about me staying a few extra days.

780
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:26,491
- What? A few extra days?
- Uh, 14, give or take.

781
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:29,327
What did I say
about throwing darts?

782
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,862
That's a lot of days, Kate,
and a couple of key games.

783
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:35,300
All right, but I have a plan.
If we just take it one day at a time...

784
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,368
and if you start to get overwhelmed
or the kids stage a coup,

785
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,370
you call me up, I'm home,
end of trip.

786
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:42,973
Well, uh, s-s-sounds good.
Sounds good.

787
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,842
Got him in the face!

788
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:48,579
Okay, honey, thanks for doin' this.
Give me someone.

789
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,217
Oh. Hey, uh, you know what?
They're doing homework right now,

790
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:56,987
and it's that math, uh, trig... "trigadronomy"
thing that you and I just aren't very good at.

791
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,925
And it's the sweetest thing.
They formed a little study group...

792
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,562
and they're helping each other, and,
uh, it's like a little mini, uh,

793
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:08,433
think tank thing.

794
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,701
And I'd just hate
to break that up.

795
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:14,439
Well, give everyone my love,
and you call me right after dinner, okay?

796
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,507
Okay. Will do.
Bye.

797
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,310
Bye. Come on, Dad.
Don't hide in the closet.

798
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,512
Take it like a man!

799
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,481
Two weeks'll go by in no time, guys.
You'll see.

800
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:26,117
Yeah, right!

801
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,619
Yeah, right.

802
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:33,023
Yeah?

803
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,759
Hey.
What's up?

804
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,827
Okay?
Come in.

805
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,634
Look, your mom's not coming
home for a couple of weeks.

806
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,639
What?

807
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:51,442
Okay. Up till now,
I've been, like, mellow...

808
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:55,613
about this whole having-it-all lifestyle
that you and Mom are currently into...

809
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,783
"A," because Sarah has the drama
queen role totally covered,

810
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:02,320
and "B," because I've benefited
from your salary spike...

811
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:05,656
in various shallow
but nonetheless pleasing ways.

812
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:09,894
But, Dad, check it out. This afternoon,
Mike was repelling from the roof,

813
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,762
Nigel was using Kim
as a human dartboard,

814
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,632
and you employed your son
as a vomit mop.

815
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:19,036
Call me crazy, Pops, but things are
getting pretty twisted around here.

816
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:21,672
I need to hire some help.

817
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:25,042
As in a babysitter? Okay,
that is so not happening.

818
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:27,878
Dad, just call Mom and tell
her we need her back home.

819
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,381
I just can't do that right now,
not with all the work she's done.

820
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:32,450
It just wouldn't
be fair.

821
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:35,753
Well, then why don't you
spend more time at home?

822
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,456
Honey, that's just not
an option right now.

823
00:52:38,523 --> 00:52:41,326
I've got a big job,
a job that I love.

824
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,628
I'm gonna have to
call in some backup.

825
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:46,231
* Help
I need somebody *

826
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,599
* Help
Not just anybody *

827
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,269
* Help
You know, I need someone *

828
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,170
* Help *
Hello.

829
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:57,041
Uh, my name is Tom Baker, and I'm
interested in hiring a domestic helper.

830
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:01,246
**
Um, I have 12 children.

831
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,349
Actually, I'm serious.

832
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,951
- Just 12.
- Twelve.

833
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,320
There's only two.
Oh, plus 10.

834
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:12,790
How many kids? Well, uh,
when you get here we can just count 'em up.

835
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,825
Well, there's 12.
But one doesn't live with me,

836
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,894
and one you never see
'cause he's so mad.

837
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:18,463
Uh, a dozen?

838
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:23,901
* And I do appreciate
your being around *

839
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:28,573
* Help me get my feet
back on the ground *

840
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,009
* Won't you please,
please help me * Just-Just-Just 12.

841
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:35,413
* Help me, help me ** Hello.
I'll just hang up on myself.

842
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,950
**

843
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,240
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Mike. What's up?

844
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:06,344
It's Mark. Right.
Mark. What's up?

845
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:08,446
I don't get this math homework.

846
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,917
Hey, you know what?
I've got a game I'm not nearly prepared for.

847
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,985
Could you go ask one of
your sisters to help you?

848
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,323
Yeah. Okay.

849
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:28,433
Forget it.

850
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,606
Hello. Yeah,
could you do me a favor...

851
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:41,078
and send up 12 pillows
to 504?

852
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,047
Yes.

853
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,282
Thank you.

854
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,652
Mmm.
That'll be good.

855
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:55,526
"Hey, kids,
I had to get to work.

856
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,528
"Lorraine and Kim,
you're in charge of breakfast.

857
00:54:57,595 --> 00:55:02,533
Henry and Jake, lunches.
Charlie, handle drop-offs."

858
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,336
Come on, Charlie.
We're gonna be late.

859
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:08,305
Cute car seats, Baker.

860
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,575
You know, we had to take our
little brothers to nursery school,

861
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,743
if that's okay with you.

862
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,312
What happened?
Did-Did Mommy and Daddy go back to the farm?

863
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,649
You know what? This whole "harass the hick"
thing's getting pretty old.

864
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:20,751
Actually, I'm just
gettin' started.

865
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,520
Yeah? What else you got?
Yeah.

866
00:55:22,587 --> 00:55:24,489
You don't wanna know, man.
Oh, I wanna know.

867
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:27,525
Charlie!
Charlie, Charlie, stop.

868
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:29,794
Stop. Just let it go, okay?
Please.

869
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,563
Yeah, Charlie.
Let it go, and go...

870
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,865
all the way back to Podunk.

871
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:37,968
Charlie, go.
Go.

872
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:43,273
** Hey, Gil,
I got a real shot with this team.

873
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,676
They're 2-0.
They're rising in the national standings,

874
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:47,678
and they're taking
nothing for granted.

875
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:52,316
Hey, Coach.
Hey, teenager, what's up?

876
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:54,919
We need to talk.
Sure.

877
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,625
Look, Dad, um...
Hey, guys, knock it off!

878
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,727
All right, Coach!

879
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,665
I know you're all lit up
about this new job,

880
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:10,067
but my new school...
The press is waiting, Bake!

881
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:13,671
- They're out there now?
- Yeah. Come on. Get dressed. - Hey, can we do this later?

882
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:38,929
Hey, kids.
How was your day at school?

883
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:43,133
I'd say the high point was that you're
only 45 minutes late picking us up.

884
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,103
Hey, you know what?
There was a pep rally at school today.

885
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,507
There were 20,000 people in the stands,
and I just couldn't leave.

886
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:52,877
- Here.
- Hey, you did a drawing.

887
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:56,481
"My favorite place
in the world..."

888
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,751
Is that the Midland house?

889
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:15,766
President Gerhard and I have
been waiting for a half an hour.

890
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,902
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had to...

891
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:19,870
I know you have responsibilities at home,
Bake, but this is it.

892
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:22,272
This is your shot,
your moment, not theirs.

893
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:25,175
What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?

894
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,812
You've wanted this
for as long as I've known you.

895
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,214
I just don't want to
see you blow it.

896
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,317
I'll work something out.

897
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:37,121
It's hard to believe someone as
staggeringly beautiful as you...

898
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:40,891
could deliver 12 children and
still look as yummy as you do.

899
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,694
Oh, that's so sweet.

900
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,130
I guess the camera
can't see my hips.

901
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,133
Tell us, did you
have them conventionally?

902
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:59,043
Well, uh, after the sixth one,
they just kind of walked out.

903
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:02,847
Why don't you read us a little
something from your book?

904
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:06,250
Oh, I don't know. No.
People can just buy it and then read it.

905
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,119
Oh, come on.
The audience wants it.

906
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,989
Oh, all right. Okay.

907
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,391
"Some, uh, call me a mom.

908
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,661
"Others call me
a primary caregiver.

909
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:19,229
But they both mean
the same thing: chauffeur."

910
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,166
You know, it sounds like you and your
husband have things under control at home.

911
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,102
Oh, well, I'm lucky
to have him. We sure do.

912
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,838
Kids, on the carpet! Now!

913
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,813
Dad!

914
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,650
College guys?

915
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:42,787
- What's goin' on here?
- Where's Charlie?

916
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,523
- He went to Midland for the day.
- Midland? It's a school day.

917
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,994
- He hates school.
- 'Course you couldn't know that 'cause you're never home.

918
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:53,931
Well, that is about
to change, Sarah Baker.

919
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:57,001
Because since I can't go to work
without you guys getting in trouble,

920
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,070
and since I can't stay home
without Shake bugging me,

921
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,172
I have brought my work
home with me.

922
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,341
Guys, meet the family.
Family, meet the team.

923
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,543
- 'Sup, boys?
- What's up?

924
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,513
Okay, we will be in the living room.
We got a lot of work to do.

925
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,717
I don't want any interruptions
unless it's an emergency. Clear?

926
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:16,821
Okay. Now go do your homework.
Let's go, guys.

927
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,796
All right, first team, line up!
* The faster we're falling *

928
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:27,965
* We're stopping and stalling *

929
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,200
Good. Good. Good.
* We're running in circles again *

930
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:34,238
But you hit 'em too high.
You wanna hit 'em low. **

931
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:41,111
Twenty-four.

932
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:44,014
* Maybe we're just
trying too hard *

933
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,684
* But really it's closer
than it is too far *

934
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:51,822
Dad, come on! * 'Cause I'm in too
deep and I'm trying to keep *

935
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:54,992
- * Up above in my head *
- Hey, how's New York?

936
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:57,094
* Instead of going under *

937
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:00,097
* 'Cause I'm in too deep
and I'm trying to keep *

938
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:02,867
- * Up above in my head *
- Hi.

939
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,736
* Instead of going under *
Okay, I've gotta go now.

940
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:08,605
* Instead of going under *

941
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,575
I love you.

942
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:14,845
* Seems like each time
I'm with you, I lose my mind *

943
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:18,548
* Because I'm bending over
backwards to relate *

944
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,586
* It's one thing to complain but
when you're driving me insane *

945
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:25,956
* Well, then I think it's time
that we took a break *

946
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:30,460
* Maybe we're
just trying too hard *

947
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:34,031
* When really it's closer
than it is too far *

01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:40,004

* Instead of going under *

954
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,827
Step off, missy!

955
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:05,963
You don't talk that way
unless it's with humor!

956
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:12,502
Something tells me you had an unpleasant
interaction with those boys, Mark.

957
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:15,005
They knocked my glasses off.

958
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,612
I heard you were
dissing my family.

959
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,581
I don't even know
your family, loser.

960
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,451
- You do now.
- My latte!

961

* Instead of going under **

969
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:01,786
All right, enough is enough.

970
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:05,355
You're slacking on your chores. You're
fighting at school. Things are out of control.

971
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,826
As of this moment,
you are all grounded.

972
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:11,962
- What's "grounded"?
- "What's grounded?"

973
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:15,766
I'll tell you what grounded is.
Except for attending games,

974
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,335
you go to school;
you come home from school;

975
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,670
you do your homework;
you do your chores;

976
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,572
you go to bed;
and that's it.

977
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,810
- But that...
- Oh, yes, Sarah, I know. That sucks.

978
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:29,446
- But that's the way it is.
- Does this mean we can't go to Dylan's birthday party?

979
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:33,617
- That's exactly what it means.
- We bought his presents already.

980
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,886
You are going to miss it!

981
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:39,957
Now, go to bed!

982
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:17,727
Hey, Gunner. Wanna get
up on the bed, buddy? Huh?

983
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,130
Come on.

984
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,334
Come on.

985
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:58,502
**

986
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:07,411
Hello. Next year,
let's book the Mormon Tabernacle Choir too.

987
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:11,415
Whatever happened to
pin the tail on the donkey?

988
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:15,052
And on the end around, the guard pulls.
That means you, Buttler.

989
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,255
**

990
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:39,476
I'm going to Dylan's
birthday party. Who's with me?

991
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,912
Yeah!

992
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,400
Hi... Oh.

993
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,044
Brazilian mud viper.
She gets one live rat a week.

994
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:21,851
Hey, Dylan. Wanna play catch
with the football I got you?

995
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,022
Uh, my nanny'd have to
check with my dad...

996
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:29,026
who'd have to check with my mom who would say
it was an inappropriate use of free time.

997
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:32,329
Hmm. Sounds like a "yes" to me.
Go get it, Mike.

998
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:45,775
And, O'Neal, you gotta crack the
first guy that shows outside.

999
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,178
Run, Billy! Run!

1000
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,958
Kids?

1001
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,378
Get my kids.
I'll meet you at the house.

1002
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:24,248
Ready!
Break!

1003
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,596
Sarah Baker, off, now!

1004
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:42,399
- No way!
- Don't make me come up there!

1005
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:10,127
Oh, my God!
It's gonna blow!

1006
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,976
Aaaah!

1007
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,846
It was my best birthday
ever, Coach.

1008
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:32,749
Your children are never
playing with Dylan again!

1009
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:35,519
Sorry about your arm, Dylan.

1010
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:38,054
Hello, Shake.

1011
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:40,857
Any idea what this could do to my program?
Don't speak. Listen.

1012
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:43,960
I don't want the players at your house,
and I don't want your kids in the department.

1013
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:48,232
- There he is!
- Coach! Coach! How will this impact Saturday's game?

1014
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:52,469
Coach, what do you have to say to reports that
you're simply spreading yourself too thin?

1015
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:56,640
- Is this child care or football?
- Sarah from Evanston, you're on with Kate Baker.

1016
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:58,975
Mom, it's Sarah.

1017
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,578
Hi, Sarah.
Is everything okay?

1018
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:04,481
Come home immediately.
I wanna talk to her!

1019
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:07,317
No! Guys!

1020
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:10,520
- I wanna talk to her!
- Guys, stop!

1021
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:14,191
Hello?

1022
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:16,626
Now look what you did.

1023
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:27,704
Dad?
Oh, Nora.

1024
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,740
Thanks for coming.
Thank you, thank you. I appreciate it.

1025
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:34,411
You seemed kind of desperate on the phone.
Yeah. They're... everywhere.

1026
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,815
You guys?

1027
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,271
- Hi.
- I just talked to the kids.

1028
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,973
Yes, I know everything.
Dylan's in the hospital.

1029
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,477
Charlie's about to be expelled. And Nora
taking time off from her first job to babysit?

1030
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:10,180
Can we do this later, Kate?
No, Tom.

1031
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:13,650
You promised me that you would let
me know if you couldn't handle it.

1032
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:17,387
I'm doing the best I can.
Please, let's talk later.

1033
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:19,756
Bye.

1034
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:27,931
What's the matter?
The book tour's over for me. I'm going home.

1035
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,438
Get a move on, guys. We gotta
get dinner on the table.

1036
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:41,311
Hi. It's me.
Okay, I'm coming home.

1037
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,480
Now, I know this
is gonna be a big strain.

1038
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:47,016
The publishing company arranged for the Oprah
Winfrey Show to tape at our house tomorrow,

1039
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:50,119
which is, you know, great, but
I'm really gonna need your help.

1040
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,890
We're talking Bakers full force. Boys,
you clean up the outside; girls, the inside.

1041
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:56,159
I want everybody
in fancy, nice, clean clothes.

1042
01:09:56,226 --> 01:10:00,597
And, Tom, if you could please supervise this
one last thing, I would really appreciate it.

1043
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:03,166
Okay? All right. Bye.

1044
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:05,702
Sounds like somebody
got his jimmy whipped.

1045
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:11,675
Jimmy whipped!

1046
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,283
Mommy!

1047
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:25,515
Beans, you okay?

1048
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,824
Go get dressed, guys.

1049
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:40,129
Hello.

1050
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:42,932
Oh, it's me. Yeah. My flight was delayed.
They lost my luggage.

1051
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,234
I'm gettin' there
as soon as I can. Sorry.

1052
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,672
Okay. Those are
for Oprah's people!

1053
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:52,008
Is the house clean?
We're working on it, Kate.

1054
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:55,612
Okay. I'll see you
when I see you.

1055
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,749
Okay, guys, good job!
Go inside and get cleaned up.

1056
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,786
Come on! Hustle up!
Hustle up! Let's go!

1057
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,631
Camera truck's here!

1058
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:25,308
I need warm water!
Look out, Dad!

1059
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:28,512
Don't make a mess
in the kitchen!

1060
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:31,481
Hello? Uh, Baker house?

1061
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,550
Yeah. You guys from Oprah?
Yes, sir.

1062
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:35,885
- She's really gonna be here?
- Any time now.

1063
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:39,022
Okay, well, just, you know,
set up anywhere.

1064
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,558
Will do.
Let's go, guys.

1065
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:46,830
All right.
Let's set up over here, guys.

1066
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,604
Knock much?
You got kicked off the team.

1067
01:12:54,671 --> 01:12:57,507
Well, look who decided
to be a parent!

1068
01:12:57,574 --> 01:13:00,143
Let's check
that attitude, Charlie.

1069
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:04,180
I don't fit in this town, Dad.
I'm going back to Midland.

1070
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:08,317
You are not dropping out of school,
and you are not walking out on this family.

1071
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,353
What family?

1072
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:14,323
Since we moved here, everybody's been looking
out for number one, especially you and Mom.

1073
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,260
Your mother and I are doing what
we think is best for everyone.

1074
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,764
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You did not take this coaching job for us.

1075
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:25,068
You took this because you were a loser in
college while Shake was being a superstar.

1076
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:29,439
If you want your shot at glory, if you wanna
have it all, you do what you gotta do.

1077
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:32,909
But quit feeding us this line about
being a happier and stronger family.

1078
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:37,313
This move was about you!
And you know what?

1079
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:42,586
I don't have to sit here and pay the
price for your life choices. I'm leaving.

1080
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,356
You're staying.

1081
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,559
Are you gonna make me?

1082
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:55,031
Charlie, I love you.

1083
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:58,768
I want you to have
the best life you can have.

1084
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:01,705
And that means you're
getting a diploma.

1085
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:07,944
When I graduate, I'm gone.

1086
01:14:13,049 --> 01:14:17,153
Hey, Charlie, am I looking
okay for national TV?

1087
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:22,391
You know, you turned into
a jerk when we moved here!

1088
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,496
Everybody turned into a jerk
when we moved here.

1089
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:41,611
Charlie?

1090
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,549
Mom's home!

1091
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:47,684
Mommy!
Mommy!

1092
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:52,822
Mommy!
Never go away again! Hi.

1093
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:55,224
Mom, listen up. Here's the sizzle.
I missed you, honey.

1094
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,161
Okay, Dad is stressed to the
point of a total meltdown.

1095
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,964
Charlie's like a half a step away from juvie,
and Mark's...

1096
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,767
Okay. Oprah's coming.
We'll talk about it later. Here we go.

1097
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,803
Whatever.
I just wanna get everything ready.

1098
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,072
- What's the deal with Charlie?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?

1099
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:12,642
I'm sorry. Hi. Hi.
Charlie got kicked off the football team.

1100
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:15,144
What? Don't worry.
I'm handling it.

1101
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:22,586
Shake. President Gerhard.

1102
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,588
Tom.
Tom, we need a minute.

1103
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:29,258
Please don't die, Beans.

1104
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:33,462
The university is prepared to make
an investment in the program,

1105
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,464
but we want some assurances.

1106
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,068
- What does that mean?
- We wanna know you're committed to the football program.

1107
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,573
You have to decide who's making
the bacon and who's cooking it.

1108
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,042
So what's it gonna be, Tom?

1109
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:48,377
Tom, didn't you pick up
my dry cleaning?

1110
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:50,947
Yes, dear.
It's in the front closet.

1111
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:54,350
Well, I guess the wife
just answered our question.

1112
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:57,621
The wife's name
is Kate, Shake.

1113
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:01,825
What a wiener.

1114
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:07,196
We want an answer by Monday,
Tom. This meeting's over.

1115
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,811
I'm all right.

1116
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:27,316
I love you.

1117
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:29,886
I'm gonna go get ready.

1118
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:33,022
Sorry, Dad.

1119
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,232
What's this?

1120
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:46,035
Hank slept over.
Do you have a problem with that?

1121
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,538
Yes, I have a problem with that!
This house is G-rated.

1122
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,541
Whoa, chief.
Look, Nora's a big girl.

1123
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,645
Now would be
an excellent time...

1124
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:59,482
for you to be
very, very quiet,

1125
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,617
chief.

1126
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,822
Now, get dressed
and get downstairs.

1127
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:08,892
Whoa.

1128
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:14,931
I just... I can't believe you let
things get this bad around here.

1129
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:17,133
I can't believe it.
What can I say?

1130
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,936
You didn't pick the perfect
moment to have a career.

1131
01:17:20,003 --> 01:17:22,371
Oh, okay, yeah. I'm not even
gonna touch that hypocrisy.

1132
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:25,274
You told me to go to New York.
Mr. I Can Handle It.

1133
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:28,277
"Everything'll be okay.
Go, Kate!" Help me, would you?

1134
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:31,748
So you're telling me you didn't
want to go to New York?

1135
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:34,617
No. I want a lot of things.
So do you.

1136
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:38,187
That's the problem.
This isn't working.

1137
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:42,258
Yeah. That's my point.
I meant the zipper.

1138
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,499
Let's just get through
the next hour, okay?

1139
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:53,002
Fine.
Fine.

1140
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,473
Okay, everybody. I know
it's been a difficult day,

1141
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,811
but I need all of you, and I would appreciate
it if you could just put on happy faces.

1142
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:04,313
Everything's great.
We're a big, happy family.

1143
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,350
If you can remember the lines
I told you to say to Oprah.

1144
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:10,987
If you can't remember, don't say anything.
Big smiles. Let me see 'em.

1145
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:14,290
Mom, Beans is dead.

1146
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,659
Nobody cares
about your stupid frog, FedEx.

1147
01:18:16,726 --> 01:18:19,162
Stop calling me that!

1148
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:23,733
Don't you dare call him that!

1149
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:29,705
All right! Hey!
Stop it! Stop it!

1150
01:18:29,773 --> 01:18:32,041
What's the name
of this segment again?

1151
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:34,643
Uh, "One Big Happy Family."

1152
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,180
Okay, I'm calling
Oprah's people right now.

1153
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:40,583
All I'm saying is,
families are inevitable.

1154
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,119
It's like death or taxes.

1155
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:45,688
Does that mean
you don't want children?

1156
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:47,957
Leave him alone!
Hello!

1157
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:50,760
Look at these...
They're monsters!

1158
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:55,799
Honey, you can't want this.
That's why you're with me.

1159
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,837
Nora! Come on!
We need you down here!

1160
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,139
You're stepping on me! Stop!

1161
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:06,109
Nigel, get off
your brother's head!

1162
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:09,145
Get off me!
Nobody cares about me!

1163
01:19:09,212 --> 01:19:11,981
Nobody cares about me!
Mark, what's going on?

1164
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:14,717
- Mark! Mark!
- What are you talking about?

1165
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:18,621
I'm perfect! I've never done anything
like this before! No! None of that!

1166
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:22,959
- Hey! Hey!
- No, you do not want to come down here.

1167
01:19:23,026 --> 01:19:25,728
No, it's the farthest thing
from a happy family.

1168
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:30,166
Why am I the only normal
person in the family?

1169
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,002
Feel free to sleep
on the couch.

1170
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:08,872
You read my mind.

1171
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:13,109
Daddy, are you and Mommy
gonna get a divorce?

1172
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:20,149
Come here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1173
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:22,085
Mark's gone.

1174
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:30,326
- Mark's gone.
- What?

1175
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:33,196
Hey, Dad.

1176
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:36,365
What I said before...
I was out of line.

1177
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,634
Forget it.

1178
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:41,537
You were right.

1179
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:48,211
Mark!

1180
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:00,123
Hello.

1181
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,992
Hey, Mark ran away.
Is he with you?

1182
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,861
No. We'll come
help you look.

1183
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:13,536
There's me! Oh.

1184
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:16,906
- Mark's missing.
- Oh.

1185
01:21:16,973 --> 01:21:19,808
Take it to the max.
Tommy Max.

1186
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,245
Let's go.

1187
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:24,513
I look great.

1188
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,716
Did you not hear me?
My brother is missing!

1189
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:30,153
No. Did you not hear me?
I'm on TV!

1190
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,627
What was that for?

1191
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:44,000
Oh. What do you want?

1192
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:47,270
My son Mark ran away.
He's not here, is he?

1193
01:21:47,336 --> 01:21:50,373
I always knew one of your kids
would land on a milk carton.

1194
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,209
Twelve is just
too big a number.

1195
01:21:53,276 --> 01:21:57,146
We'll help you look for him.
It's-It's past Dylan's bedtime.

1196
01:21:57,213 --> 01:22:00,049
We're gonna
look for him, Tina.

1197
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:02,018
Thank you.
Sure.

1198
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:07,056
Let the police handle it!
You'll never find him!

1199
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:10,759
Oh, we'll find him.
Like you said, 12's a big number.

1200
01:22:10,826 --> 01:22:14,830
Mark! Mark!
Mark!

1201
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:17,700
He's about, about...
about that high.

1202
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:21,370
He's got red hair and glasses.
There's a photo, and you can keep that.

1203
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,440
No luck.
I've been everywhere.

1204
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:27,843
Thanks for looking.

1205
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:31,447
Where's Hank?
He's not gonna make the cut.

1206
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:34,117
I hope the family
isn't to blame.

1207
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:38,554
They're totally to blame.

1208
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:45,228
I'll have officers check
the train and bus stations.

1209
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,064
He wouldn't get on a train or a bus.
He might've.

1210
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:51,767
Those times when I ran away from Midland,
I was gonna go to Chicago.

1211
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:54,003
My favorite place
in the world.

1212
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:58,641
Your favorite place
in the world.

1213
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:55,131
You said we'd be happier.
You didn't keep your promise.

1214
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,401
I know. I'm sorry.

1215
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:53,055
Mom!

1216
01:24:53,122 --> 01:24:57,025
Oh, honey! Oh!

1217
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:00,596
Oh, we missed you, sweetheart.

1218
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:03,832
Do that again, I'm going
to have to pound you.

1219
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:07,436
- But I thought I was FedEx.
- Your eccentricities and vision problems...

1220
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:11,940
are genetic traits that could be attributed
to any number of the Baker ancestors.

1221
01:25:12,007 --> 01:25:15,878
Yeah. Without you, we wouldn't
be the 12 Bakers anymore.

1222
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:19,348
We'd be, like, 11.

1223
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:23,219
I figured everybody hated me like
Sarah and Lorraine hate each other.

1224
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:26,889
There are times when
I want to kill Sarah,

1225
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:31,160
but I'd kill for her
all the time.

1226
01:25:31,227 --> 01:25:34,463
Come here, cutie.

1227
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:48,411
Tom? You wanna say
something? A few words?

1228
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,446
Sure.

1229
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,417
Beans was a good frog.

1230
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:03,058
He was, uh, not like
a lot of the bad frogs...

1231
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,529
you hear about today,
all hopped up.

1232
01:26:06,595 --> 01:26:10,966
He was lovable.
He was almost human.

1233
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:13,802
He was like, uh,
one of the family.

1234
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:17,940
Except that, of course,
he was green and he ate flies.

1235
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:22,278
But he was a hopper.

1236
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:26,749
He hipped and he hopped.

1237
01:26:28,384 --> 01:26:30,619
He loved hip-hop.

1238
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:37,660
Mark, why don't you... I think
you should say something.

1239
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:42,030
For a long time, you were
the only person I could talk to.

1240
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:44,467
That's different now.

1241
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,869
But you're the one
who got me through.

1242
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,405
Thanks.

1243
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:35,284
I'm resigning after
the season, Shake.

1244
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:40,689
Giving up the dream, huh?

1245
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,091
Just going
with a different one.

1246
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:44,727
No regrets?

1247
01:27:44,793 --> 01:27:47,730
If I screw up
raising my kids,

1248
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:49,798
nothing I achieve
will matter much.

1249
01:27:52,368 --> 01:27:54,036
Thank you.

1250
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,974
We'll make an announcement
at the end of the week.

1251
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,483
Come on. Keep the assembly line up here.
We gotta get this done.

1252
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:10,486
Where's Dad?
He went to the game.

1253
01:28:10,553 --> 01:28:13,121
Why didn't he
ask us to go?

1254
01:28:13,188 --> 01:28:17,660
Because... he didn't want you to be
there on the day that he quits his job.

1255
01:28:17,726 --> 01:28:20,363
- He's quitting his job?
- Mm-hmm.

1256
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:24,066
- What would we have to do so he wouldn't quit?
- I'll give up clarinet lessons.

1257
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:28,771
I'll go back to hand-me-downs.

1258
01:28:28,837 --> 01:28:31,139
Okay, ease up.
Everybody listen.

1259
01:28:31,206 --> 01:28:34,510
Dad's a big boy, and
he makes his own decisions,

1260
01:28:34,577 --> 01:28:37,946
and he's doing this
because it's what he wants.

1261
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:41,617
In that case, I totally take back
what I said about the hand-me-downs.

1262
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:44,920
I thought so. Anybody else
wanna take back their offer?

1263
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:48,924
Yeah, there we go.

1264
01:30:18,514 --> 01:30:21,717
I guess you could say that
when Tom and I left Midland,

1265
01:30:21,784 --> 01:30:24,753
we had a mess of theories
about how to raise children.

1266
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:28,056
We still have a mess
of children, but no theories.

1267
01:30:31,527 --> 01:30:33,596
Sure, 12 is still our number.

1268
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:39,635
It's the number of months my book
was on the best-seller list.

1269
01:30:39,702 --> 01:30:44,573
It's the number of job offers Tom turned
down before we found one close to home.

1270
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,543
Hike!

1271
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:56,451
And each day, it's the number of times I'm
thankful there's such a thing as family.

1272
01:30:56,519 --> 01:30:59,354

1296
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:16,932
Yeah, you got room for all your big
old family in that new apartment?

1297
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:19,434
You're on camera, Steve.
Sorry. I am.

1298
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:21,770
**
You idiot.

1299
01:32:21,837 --> 01:32:25,708
Yeah, you got room in your
new apartment for that...

1300
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:27,910
Battleax
of a wife of mine?

1301
01:32:27,976 --> 01:32:29,778
You got...

1302
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:31,847
Act angry, not grumpy.

1303
01:32:31,914 --> 01:32:34,216
I really am grumpy.
Well, that's good.

1304
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,118
Two times?

1305
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:38,253
Two times. Ready?
Then going outside?

1306
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,889
Yeah. Actually, we're
almost done, so let's do it.

1307
01:32:40,956 --> 01:32:43,025
On your mark, get set, go!

1308
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:45,560
I don't wanna move!
I don't wanna move!

1309
01:32:45,628 --> 01:32:47,996
Cut. Good job. Okay?

1310
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:52,100
I listened...
I listened the "goodest."

1311
01:32:53,769 --> 01:32:56,138
I don't wanna do it anymore.

1312
01:32:56,204 --> 01:32:58,974
One more time.
Last one and you're outta here.

1313
01:33:00,609 --> 01:33:03,378
Cut! Cut! Cut!

1314
01:33:03,445 --> 01:33:05,648
Somebody help me!
Help me!

1315
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:08,684
Whoa!
Just for the record, Mom...

1316
01:33:08,751 --> 01:33:11,620
Be careful, pally.
Slow down on that stuff.

1317
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:15,858
You're not gonna remember a damn thing in
school if you suck 'em back like I do.

1318
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,661
Now, on the end around
the guard pulls.

1319
01:33:18,727 --> 01:33:21,864
That means you, Buttler.
Whoa.

1320
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:25,133
Cut!

1321
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:28,136
Action!
Frankly, I'm concerned.

1322
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:30,939
I go around those kids,
they start beatin' on me.

1323
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:33,175
What if I get a black eye?

1324
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:37,545
Frankly, I'm concerned, honey.
The kids set me on fire, they beat me.

1325
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,783
They're abusive.

1326
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:43,585
This is how I get jobs,
right here!

1327
01:33:43,652 --> 01:33:46,221
I'm sorry. I looked
at myself in the camera.

1328
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:48,523
I'm so... good-looking.
They set me on fire!

1329
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:51,760
Sounds good to me.
All the kids wrapped in duct tape.

1330
01:33:51,827 --> 01:33:54,663
Maybe we can just roll,
roll ourselves in duct tape,

1331
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:57,232
and then I can just
roll you across the floor.

1332
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,301
Together, maybe.

1333
01:34:04,406 --> 01:34:06,909
Ow!

1334
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:23,792
**

1335
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:26,594
* What wishes will you make *

1336
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,431
* When the season is near *

1337
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,700
* Will your dreams be the same *

1338
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:34,002
* As they were last year *

1339
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:36,604
* Will you ask for a little *

1340
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,041
* Will you ask for a lot *

1341
01:34:39,107 --> 01:34:41,343
* And when you make your list *

1342
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:43,979
* Will there be something
you forgot *

1343
01:34:44,046 --> 01:34:46,749
* How about peace on Earth *

1344
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:48,917
* It can't be bought or sold *

1345
01:34:48,984 --> 01:34:51,887
* How about peace
this Christmas *

1346
01:34:51,954 --> 01:34:54,156
* And someone's hand to hold *

1347
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:57,025
* How about love in our hearts *

1348
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:59,127
* And hope for you and me *

1349
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:02,765
* How about peace on Earth *

1350
01:35:02,831 --> 01:35:06,101
* That's what Christmas
should be *

1351
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:12,140
* You can get all the things *

1352
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:14,642
* That you've been waiting for *

1353
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,879
* Snowfall and presents *

1354
01:35:16,945 --> 01:35:19,214
* Choirs singing at your door *

1355
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:21,850
* This season will be perfect *

1356
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:24,820
* Like those picture
postcard scenes *

1357
01:35:24,887 --> 01:35:27,122
* But is that the answer *

1358
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:29,624
* Is that what Christmas
really means *

1359
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:32,160
* How about peace on Earth *

1360
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:34,362
* It can't be bought or sold *

1361
01:35:34,429 --> 01:35:37,532
* How about peace
this Christmas *

1362
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:39,701
* And someone's hand to hold *

1363
01:35:39,768 --> 01:35:42,537
* How about love in our hearts *

1364
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:44,539
* And hope for you and me *

1365
01:35:44,606 --> 01:35:48,110
* How about peace on Earth *

1366
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:51,079
* And that's what
Christmas should be *

1367
01:35:51,146 --> 01:35:54,049
* What would you sacrifice *

1368
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:59,021
* What would you give away *

1369
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:03,926
* For the greatest gift of all *

1370
01:36:03,992 --> 01:36:11,834
* On Christmas Day *

1371
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,137
* How about peace on Earth *

1372
01:36:15,203 --> 01:36:17,372
* It can't be bought or sold *

1373
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:20,242
* How about peace
this Christmas *

1374
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:22,277
* And someone's hand to hold *

1375
01:36:22,344 --> 01:36:25,213
* How about love in our hearts *

1376
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,549
* And hope for you and me *

1377
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:35,157
* How about peace on Earth *

1378
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:37,425
* It can't be bought or sold *

1379
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:40,628
* How about peace
this Christmas *

1380
01:36:40,695 --> 01:36:42,831
* And someone's hand to hold *

1381
01:36:42,898 --> 01:36:45,834

1383
01:36:47,903 --> 01:36:51,139
* How about peace on Earth *

1384
01:36:51,206 --> 01:36:53,208
* Peace on Earth *

1385
01:36:53,275 --> 01:36:56,444
* How about peace on Earth *

1386
01:36:56,511 --> 01:37:01,884
* That's what Christmas
should be *

1387
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:05,988
* Christmas Day *

1388
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:09,457
* Christmas Day **
