1
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,694
(water sloshing)

2
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,535
(gasps and coughs)

3
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,765
( eerie whispering)

4
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,770
Oh!

5
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,076
Ow!

6
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,244
(screaming)
Help! Help!

7
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,546
Am I dead?

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,214
(distorted Southern male voice):
You're not dead.

9
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,655
You've been taken
against your will.

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,625
Kobe? Who is that?

11
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,821
( electrical crackling)

12
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,266
Dr. Phil?
What the hell's going on?

13
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:12,031
I don't know. I was doing a show
on teens with abandonment issues...

14
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,834
and suddenly, I woke up here.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,001
Man, those kids
are gonna be pissed.

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,271
(static crackles)

17
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,936
MALE VOICE:
Hello, gentlemen.

18
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,573
You don't know me,
but I know you.

19
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,880
You both play games
with other people for a living...

20
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,853
but, today, you play a game
for your lives.

21
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,790
Right now, you are both
breathing in a deadly nerve gas.

22
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,828
You have 1 20 seconds to reach
the antidote...

23
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,192
or you die.

24
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,288
Oh, my God!
We better get out of here!

25
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,458
Let the game begin.

26
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,523
(static crackles)

27
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,467
There!

28
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,212
Hit the metal arm
with something.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,872
There.

30
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,118
- (gasps, grunts)
- Damn it!

31
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,723
Sorry.

32
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,130
Shaquille, I'm not angry at you...

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,033
but we are one minute
away from death.

34
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,503
Just shut out the ''No'' voice.

35
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,006
Own your success.

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,839
Oh!

37
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,580
Just make the damn basket!

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,981
What the hell was that for?

39
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,750
You hurt my feelings.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,884
Your feelings?
To hell with your feelings!

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,087
Everybody with their feelings!

42
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,189
(whining) ''I'm obese.''
''My kid's a brat.'' ''Help me. Help me.''

43
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,528
Just shut up!

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,591
( crying)
Why can't I fix anyone?

45
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,129
I'm so dumb and worthless!
Mama was right! Mama was right!

46
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,904
Hey, hey! Pull yourself together.
You're a brilliant doctor.

47
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,002
(sniffling)
Not exactly.

48
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,209
- What?
- I-I just tell people to ''get real.''

49
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,718
I'm not even a psychologist.

50
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,515
I'm... an electrician.

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,022
I failed you, Shaq.
I failed you.

52
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,892
- Booyah!
- Yes!

53
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,864
DR. PHI L:
30 seconds left!

54
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,909
(Shaq screams)

55
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,145
This will never work.

56
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,273
Of course- he wants us
to cut through our feet.

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,384
You go first.

58
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,750
Bullshit.

59
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,755
Yeah.

60
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,814
You're probably not man enough.

61
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,587
I guess your mama was right.

62
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,387
Never!

63
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,797
Who's the coward now, Mama?
(grunts)

64
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,801
Candy from a baby.

65
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,632
(whimpering)

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,998
- Oh, my God!
- I did it. We're saved.

67
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,637
- What's wrong?
- Wrong foot.

68
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,444
Motherfu-

69
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,444
(heavy metal rock music plays)

70
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,761
JAMES EARLJONES:
No one believed

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,563
in the early years
of the 21 st century

72
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,661
that our world was being
watched...

73
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,640
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

74
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,471
in a drop of water.

75
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,841
# I like big butts
and I cannot lie #

76
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,675
#You other brothers can't deny #

77
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,682
#That when a girl walks in
with an itty-bitty waist #

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,379
#And round thing in your face,
you get sprung #

79
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,251
#Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed #

80
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,915
# Deep in the jeans she's wearin' #

81
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,925
# I'm hooked,
and I can't stop starin' #

82
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,223
# Oh, baby #

83
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,059
(song fades)

84
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,123
JONES:
Yet across the gulf of space

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,761
a terrible evil prepared
to unleash itself

86
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,739
upon an unsuspecting human race.

87
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,639
( cars passing, horns honking)

88
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,089
You're up early.
Come back to bed.

89
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,757
Come on.

90
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,090
Please.

91
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,603
(sets picture down)

92
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,576
Hello? Hello?

93
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,389
Tom! Oh!

94
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,221
(groans)

95
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,127
I know you missed me.
Oh, I missed you too. God, you look great.

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,688
I wanted to come by to thank you
for setting up that job interview for me.

97
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,293
This isn't a good time.

98
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,930
I just need something to keep me busy
now that Cody's out of the house.

99
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,973
He just turned 1 1 .

100
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,770
I enrolled him in military
school last year.

101
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,107
It's supposed to be
a great program.

102
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,238
Boy, kids, you know,
they just grow up so fast.

103
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,783
So I heard
that you were dating again.

104
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,081
Knowing you,
I bet she's brainy.

105
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,643
''Quixotic.''

106
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,348
90 points!

107
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,414
(whooping, giggling)

108
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,064
Oh, you know, your work with
the elderly really inspired me, Tom.

109
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,769
I mean, they have
so much to teach us...

110
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,970
and we have so much
to teach them.

111
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,980
You know, ultimately, they...
really are just like us...

112
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,608
only... older.

113
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,176
Anyway, I'm hoping that
a new career will help

114
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,782
keep my mind off of...
bad memories.

115
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:10,022
I'm sure you have memories, too.
He's the kind of person you never forget.

116
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,121
Sometimes, I wake up in
the middle of the night

117
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,928
wondering where he is,
and then I remember.

118
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,461
I know you miss him, too,
but it's really been hardest on me.

119
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,507
I'm rattling on, but if you
don't vent your emotions...

120
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,237
they just well up inside of you
and burst out.

121
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,041
The harder you try,
the harder it all gets...

122
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,412
till you just can't
shake it off anymore.

123
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,472
Oh!

124
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,543
Like you're carrying around
this enormous burden.

125
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,645
Sometimes your problems
get so big.

126
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,212
(meows, screeches)

127
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,485
(screams)

128
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,027
- And then what do you say to yourself?
-Jesus!

129
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,495
Yes, you can turn to religion
or family and friends...

130
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,159
but in the end,
you're still in agony.

131
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,725
Maybe that's why
I want to become a nurse.

132
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,705
I'm just- I'm so in tune
with everyone's emotions.

133
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,504
I guess I've always had
a knack for being-

134
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,340
(screaming, then splat)

135
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,175
Oh, my-

136
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,718
(wind whistling)

137
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,665
(seagulls screeching)

138
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,825
( engine rumbling)

139
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,905
MAN: Ryan, go home.
You've been working 1 6 straight hours.

140
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,240
Come on, I need the overtime.

141
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,211
Don't worry. Okay?

142
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,748
I'm wide-

143
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,784
(alarm buzzes)

144
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:43,288
MAN:
Ryan! What are you doing?

145
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,157
That was gold bullion-

146
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,286
No, not the monkeys!

147
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,696
(toots)

148
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,070
- (screeching)
- MAN: They're loose!

149
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:03,268
(ship's horn bellows)

150
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,674
Damn it, Tom!
What the hell happened back there?

151
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,838
Aw, come on, Ed.
That could've happened to anyone.

152
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,508
Oh, yeah?
You know what your problem is?

153
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,643
As soon as the going gets tough,
you give up.

154
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,085
You're right. I quit.

155
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,816
Ah, you don't get it, do you?

156
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,859
You could be the best,
if only you'd see things through.

157
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,418
- I don't know.
- Give me a break.

158
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,624
What can I tell you, Ed?
I guess I'm no good.

159
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,428
- Maybe I just don't have what it takes.
- (hooting)

160
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,403
What are you talking about?
You secured that tricky H-500 unit, didn't you?

161
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,268
Aw, come on. That was easy.

162
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,842
(rockabilly music plays)

163
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,982
Tom Ryan.
I haven't seen you in a while.

164
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:49,249
Well, I spend every waking minute
of my life operating a crane.

165
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,313
God, I hate my job.

166
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,087
Yo, Tom! Where you been?

167
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,654
Mahalik.

168
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,563
Yo, C.J.,
this is my boy Tom Ryan.

169
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,795
We used to work together
down at the docks.

170
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,029
Ya-hi! Ya-hi! Ya-hi!

171
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,766
- Hey, Tom. How's the family, man?
- You remember Marilyn?

172
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,365
- Your lovely wife- how could I forget?
- She dumped me.

173
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,378
Yeah, I know.
I slept with her a few times.

174
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,879
- What?
- Me too.

175
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,973
You guys talking about Marilyn?
Great lay.

176
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,314
My pops introduced me to her.

177
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,411
Ever since the divorce,
it's like my life has no purpose.

178
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,285
Half the time I walk around
feeling like a zombie.

179
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,723
Yo, don't joke about zombies.
That shit there- that's real.

180
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,226
Yo, you know Nashawn,
down on 1 20th Street?

181
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,284
Yeah.

182
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,127
She told me that she heard a zombie
going through her trash the other day.

183
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,030
The next morning,
she turned up missing.

184
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,228
- Uh-
- What? Okay, back up.

185
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,237
How in the hell
do you ''turn up missing''?

186
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,001
'Cause nobody knows where you are
when they realize you ain't there!

187
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,336
Guys, I'm trying to ask-

188
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,503
So you telling me that you can appear
and disappear at the same time.

189
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,104
No, man. You can't appear
and disappear at the same time.

190
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,206
- The bitch ain't David Copperfield!
- Uh, guys-

191
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,682
Mmm. No, no.

192
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,186
But you can't be gone from one place
and show up somewhere else entirely.

193
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,245
So when you turn up,
you're never missing.

194
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,689
And when you're missing,
you never turn up.

195
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,387
Unless... you a zombie.

196
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,894
Damn!

197
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,898
Hey, that's some plausible shit right there.
You should blog about that.

198
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,867
- I'm gonna put that on MySpace.
- You do that!

199
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,596
(grunts)
Hey, Tom.

200
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,697
You know what you need to do, man?
You need to get away from all this.

201
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,675
- You need to take a break.
- Oh, I don't know.

202
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,235
No, no. He's right, man. You should
come fishing with us one weekend.

203
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,282
Me and Mahalik, we found
this great spot last summer.

204
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,682
Yeah. A great spot.

205
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,317
(sheep bleating)

206
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,291
Hey. You cold?

207
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,260
- L-Little bit.
- Hmm.

208
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,438
Hey. Look, man, um-

209
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,374
I'm not on the down-low
or nothing, all right?

210
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,881
Oh, that's cool, man.
Me, neither.

211
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,449
- Hey, what you doing?
- Relax, man.

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,954
I'm just trying to grab some nuts.

213
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,754
C.J., what are you doin'?

214
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,461
- I just wanna eat some peanuts.
- Huh?

215
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,868
See? Peanuts.

216
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,844
# I've been alone with you
inside my mind #

217
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,945
#And in my dreams,
I've kissed your lips #

218
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,915
(whispering)
#A thousand times #

219
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:48,657
# I sometimes see you pass
outside my door #

220
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,965
BOTH:
# Hello #

221
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,529
# Is it me you're looking for? #

222
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,601
# I can see it in your eyes #

223
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,943
# I can see it in your smile #

224
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,280
#You're all I ever wanted #

225
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,685
#And my arms are open wide #

226
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,053
# 'Cause you know just what to say #

227
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,319
(sighs)

228
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,123
#And you know just what to do #

229
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,391
Ooh, baby.

230
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,696
#And I want to tell you so much #

231
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,928
( crackles)

232
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,800
BOTH:
# I love you. #

233
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,968
(rattling)

234
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,238
Yeah...
we caught a lot of fish.

235
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,804
Yeah.

236
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,372
(inhales deeply)

237
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,315
Black cod.

238
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,479
Damn.

239
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,456
Tom, you don't-
I don't want you thinking that-

240
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,355
Hopefully, this doesn't
affect your opin-

241
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,724
Why would you do that,
and that's my first time meeting him?

242
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,286
(tires screeching)

243
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,855
(rock music blares from radio)

244
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,899
(music stops)

245
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,272
(sighs)
Late again, Tom.

246
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,540
- Hey, Marilyn.
- I thought you were moving.

247
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:11,515
It's all I can afford right now. You took
everything in the divorce except my name.

248
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,848
No, actually, the judge
granted me that yesterday.

249
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,217
You're now officially known
as ''Horace P. MacTitties.''

250
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,357
I'm sure your new husband is pleased.

251
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,088
He's a good man.
A provider, unlike you.

252
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,993
You never cared
about our children.

253
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,555
Hey, that's not true.
I'm a great dad.

254
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,101
Kids!

255
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,193
Dad?

256
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,208
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Rachel.

257
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,042
How's it going there,
uh... Princess?

258
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,913
- (door knob rattling)
- It's locked.

259
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,677
Hey! Let me help you
with that, muffin.

260
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,245
- I should do that.
- It's no problem.

261
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,314
- I honestly don't mind.
- Neither do I.

262
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,257
- Fine. You take it.
- (screaming)

263
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,727
I'll see you on Tuesday.

264
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,127
Hey, Marilyn.

265
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,429
That's a good look for you,
being pregnant.

266
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,100
I'm not pregnant!

267
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,163
I didn't meant to-
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,108
If you want to make things right,
maybe you should start with our kids.

269
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,112
You're right. Those kids
are all I have in this world.

270
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,842
Well, the kids... and my car.

271
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,579
(Rachel grunting)
Ow!

272
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,249
Mr. Koji, looks like we need
someone new for the Norris account.

273
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,816
Again?

274
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,954
Every day we don't have someone looking
after this woman, I lose big money.

275
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,489
- What happened to last girl?
- Yoko. Take a look.

276
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,001
MR. KOJI:
Holy shit!

277
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,664
Someone put a towel under her
or something. Christ!

278
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,641
It's the Norris house, Mr. Koji.
They say it's cursed.

279
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,701
There no such thing as a curse.

280
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,440
Don't be ridiculous.

281
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,880
Those just old wives' tales.

282
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,613
I need someone there today
or I'm in big trouble.

283
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,177
(doorbell jingles)

284
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,614
Hello. I'm Cindy Campbell.

285
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,956
I'm looking for a job
in home health care.

286
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,886
I was recommended by a family friend,
but unfortunately, he committed-

287
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,729
Oh, my God!

288
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,860
Don't mind her.
She slip and fall.

289
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,235
You my new best employee.
Ready start today?

290
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,240
Oh, it's so fast. I don't know.

291
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,572
Oh, trust me.
Uh, you're gonna love this job.

292
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,078
Come on, I show you.
We can be there 1 0 minutes.

293
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,609
(wind whooshing)

294
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,259
Come! Come!

295
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,600
Mr. Koji?

296
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,707
Hello?

297
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,445
(squeaking)

298
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,054
Oh, my God! Oh!

299
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,456
Okay, oh.

300
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,892
- Oh, let's get you up and-
- Oh!

301
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,556
Okay, come on.
Here we go.

302
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,259
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- There you are.

303
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,131
I see you've met Mrs. Norris-
she catatonic.

304
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,670
Yes, I was just trying
to get her back up on the bed.

305
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,797
I was afraid
that she would be hurt.

306
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,069
You know, when I came in,
I just saw her lying here on the floor.

307
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,873
Of course, of course. I help.
You grab her legs, I grab her arms.

308
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,243
Mrs. Norris,
I'm here to take care of you.

309
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,474
(whimpering)

310
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,143
Yes, I'm very happy
to meet you, too.

311
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,742
(groaning)

312
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,221
See? This job perfect for you.
Let me show you rest of house.

313
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,383
Right this way.

314
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,427
So, what do you think?

315
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:48,399
I don't know. There's something
strange about this house.

316
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,231
- A presence.
- A presence? Don't be silly.

317
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,066
- Nothing wrong with this house.
- It's funny.

318
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,574
I always dreamt I would live
in a house like this with my husband...

319
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,770
but I guess that's all just in the...

320
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,104
past.

321
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,274
Who wants to see upstairs?

322
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,615
It's a nice neighborhood
close to schools and shopping.

323
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,123
There are hardwood floors throughout.
Passed almost every inspection.

324
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,752
Big backyard goes back 1 00 feet.

325
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,819
(Mr. Koji continues indistinctly)

326
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,301
And in here is the bathroom.

327
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,995
Very big, very...

328
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,833
nice.

329
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,465
It is nice.

330
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,772
It seems like
it'd be a great place to work...

331
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,643
but I just can't shake
this feeling of... evil.

332
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,682
Evil? That crazy talk.

333
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,981
Do you know anything about
the people who used to live here?

334
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,686
People? No, nothing about people.
I don't remember anything.

335
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,196
Mr. Koji, did something strange
happen in this house?

336
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,856
Strange? Don't be silly.

337
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,832
This house perfectly normal.

338
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,667
I'm sure you're right, and yet...
it's as if someone's watching us.

339
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,639
(screeching)

340
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,699
Mr. Koji?

341
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:08,143
That was me...
just excited about hiring you.

342
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,148
Very, very enthusiastic!

343
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:16,916
We offer medical and dental
and two weeks' paid vacation!

344
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,516
I'm hoping...
you can start today!

345
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,651
Maybe get in a whole week!

346
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,423
You put in for this job...

347
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,691
we got wonderful opportunities for you.
(screams)

348
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:30,223
Mr. Koji, is there something
you're not telling me about this?

349
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,633
(gurgling)

350
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,870
I was... dirty.

351
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,013
So... the job?

352
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,709
I'll take it.

353
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,418
(yowls)

354
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,789
TOM: Get your glove!
I'm in the backyard!

355
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,794
Robbie, come on.
Let's go!

356
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,695
That's not how you're going
to get through to him.

357
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,960
Look, Rach, this is guy stuff.

358
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,231
- You got to trust me.
- (sighs)

359
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,239
<i>All right, Robbie, you ready
for the Tom Ryan Express?</i>

360
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,086
Yeah, maybe, one day,
I can grow up to be just like you.

361
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,214
All right,
I know I let you kids down...

362
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,986
but you have no idea
how hard it is to be a father.

363
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,655
Well, when you start,
let me know.

364
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,768
You okay?

365
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,433
My eyes! My eyes!

366
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,001
(panting)

367
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,244
Oh, much... better.

368
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,445
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

369
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,647
I've taken balls
to the face before.

370
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,521
Hi. I'm Cindy Campbell,
your new neighbor.

371
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,560
Tom, Tom Ryan.

372
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,096
You, uh, live here
all by yourself?

373
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,154
Well, I'm-I'm taking care
of Mrs. Norris...

374
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,963
but... yes, for the first time
in my life, I'm on my own.

375
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,469
I know that feeling.

376
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,837
- It wasn't always that way.
- I know.

377
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,035
You thought you'd found
your soul mate.

378
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,045
Yes.

379
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,104
And then one day
you come home...

380
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,480
and find your so-called soul mate
in bed with a complete stranger.

381
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,816
Well, not a complete stranger-
Sammy Sosa.

382
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,150
Sound familiar?

383
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,352
No, not at all.

384
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,596
But I do know what it's like
to be in that much pain...

385
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,498
and the worst part is
you have to suffer through it-

386
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,967
- Alone?
- It looks like we have a lot in-

387
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,505
Common.

388
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,268
- We're already finishing each other's-
- Dinner.

389
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,771
Sentences.

390
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,973
Well... maybe all we really need
is a friend.

391
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,611
I'd like that.

392
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,951
Well, I better get back
to Mrs. Norris.

393
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,490
It's time to put her catheter in,
and then after that...

394
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,549
I've got to scrub
in between her fat folds...

395
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,754
and I've got to lance her boils.

396
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,592
I've got to open her up
and then-

397
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,258
(voice fades out
under light, romantic theme)

398
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,592
...empty the colostomy bag and...

399
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,859
(sighs)
mop up the drool.

400
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,798
That's wonderful.

401
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,530
- I'll see you around?
- Definitely.

402
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,697
Okay.
(giggles)

403
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,765
Okay, Mrs. Norris,
time to dig out that doody bubble.

404
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,038
(gurgling, suctioning)

405
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,943
(water running)

406
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,685
(gasps)

407
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,352
(panting)

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,161
(sighs)

409
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,726
(humming)

410
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,301
(gasps)

411
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,539
(gasping)

412
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,175
(door creaking)

413
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,898
( crackling and thumping)

414
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,772
(gasps)

415
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,936
Whoa... Oh! Ow!

416
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,776
( clattering)

417
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,309
( crickets chirping)

418
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,886
- Mrs. Norris?
- (whines)

419
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,523
Have you noticed anything
strange about this house?

420
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,534
- (muffled) Yes! Yes!
- No?

421
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,569
(muffled)
Yes!

422
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,434
Oh, you're probably right.
Guess I'm just being silly.

423
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,565
- (groans)
- ( chuckling)

424
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,472
Just relax now.

425
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,273
- Here we go. Okay.
- (mutters)

426
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,577
Oh, you poor thing.
You don't have to be scared.

427
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,743
I'm here to take care of you.

428
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,186
You know, I think you and I
are going to be wonderful friends.

429
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:55,056
- (groaning)
- I do. That's right.Just relax.

430
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,526
Let's get in those ears.

431
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,463
Okay. All right.

432
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,161
That's right.
Oh, it feels good.

433
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,261
(retching)

434
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,806
Okay.

435
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,365
You love this, don't you?

436
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,742
It's nice and warm.
Feels good, doesn't it?

437
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,975
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

438
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,415
I'm so sorry!

439
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,419
(shrieks, then body thuds)

440
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,682
(screeches)

441
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,485
(grunting)

442
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,049
( clattering)

443
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:37,200
( creaking)

444
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,971
(yowling)

445
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,780
(screeching)

446
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,339
(low, guttural sounds)

447
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,013
(shrieking)

448
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,421
(panting)

449
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,398
Robbie!

450
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:44,401
Come on!

451
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,733
Let's toss the old pigskin!

452
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,365
(mouthing word)

453
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,911
(gasps, then thud)

454
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,537
Ooh.

455
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,515
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.
Are you all right?

456
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,177
(weakly) It's okay.
My throat cushioned the blow.

457
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,847
Thank God.
I lost my temper. My son's-

458
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,187
What's wrong?
You look scared.

459
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,123
Oh, nothing. It's just-

460
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,628
(sighs) There's something
going on in this house.

461
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,960
Last night, I saw a face.

462
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,694
- Did it have a nose?
- Yes.

463
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,531
That does sound like a face.

464
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:22,061
And then there was
this weird hand in the shower...

465
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,404
and this horrible thing
on the stairs.

466
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,808
I can't go through
this all again.

467
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,870
Oh, I get it.
There's some other guy.

468
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,111
You still love him, don't you?
I wish you both the best.

469
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,210
Wait! You don't understand.

470
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:40,155
It's painful to talk about,
but you deserve to know.

471
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,427
I was married once.

472
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,728
- Get out the way, bitch!
- Don't call me no bitch! You ain't shit!

473
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,665
Shut your ass up, snow ho!

474
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,801
Well... actually, married twice.

475
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,635
(voice-over): My husband and I
were living our dream.

476
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:04,375
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
your challenger, Cindy Campbell.

478
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,649
Stay loose, Cindy.
Remember your training. Keep your focus.

479
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,746
(grunts)

480
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,792
Always think, where's
the next punch coming- (shouts)

481
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,487
CI NDY (voice-over):
After 20 fights, I was undefeated.

482
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,689
Only one fighter stood
between me and the belt.

483
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,755
You got this chick.
She's nothing.

484
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,562
ANNOUNCER:

485
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,125

486
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,673
Cindy, listen to me.

487
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,438
I know you're scared, but I believe in you.
You can win this.

488
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,810
And if I do win, George, then will you
tell me what my nickname means?

489
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,815
Yes. I promise.

490
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,613
Okay. Now just stick with the jab
and lead with your right.

491
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,711
Watch your footwork.

492
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,313
- (bell ringing)
- Let's go!

493
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,053
( crowd exclaiming)

494
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,496
Whoa, whoa! You do that one more time,
I'm taking a point off, you hear me?

495
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,004
- (screams)

496
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,973

500
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,213
(panting)

501
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,978
- I can't take it anymore!
- (groans)

502
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,181
(Cindy grunting)

503
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,052
( crowd exclaiming)

504
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,186

505

CI NDY (voice-over):
And that's when I lost my cool

506
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,729
and made the biggest mistake
of my life.

507
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,734
Cindy, no!

508
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,437
Ooh, a nickel!

509
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,202
(yelling)

510
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,003
No!

00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,785

Get out of the way!

520
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,955
George!

521
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,621
( echoing)
No!

522
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,029
If I hadn't have thrown that punch,
none of it would've happened.

523
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,897
- I blame myself for it all.
- As well you should.

524
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,905
But, Cindy, the past is the past.

525
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,635
Maybe you ought to think
about your future.

526
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,700
If I'm ever going to love again...

527
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,212
it has to be with somebody
who'll be there for me.

528
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,613
Well, I don't have a great track record
in that department.Just ask my son.

529
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,380
I have.
What's an ''cock monger''?

530
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,948
Uh... that's not really important.

531
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,548
What matters is
I've let a lot of people down.

532
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,026
Oh.

533
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,258
- I should go.
- Wait!

534
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,859
Maybe I'm just not meant
to be happy...

535
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,199
but something about you
makes me want to try.

536
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,481
(wind whistling)

537
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,917
(wind howling)

538
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,653
(thunder rumbling)

539
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,922
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

540
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,323
Why is the sky so dark?

541
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,494
Why is the wind moving
towards the storm?

542
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,231
(Mrs. Norris grunting)

543
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,773
Why don't any of us have driers?

544
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,299
I've never seen clouds
like that before!

545
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,812
(zapping)

546
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,541
(shrieks)

547
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,046
(panting)

548
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,054
- You okay?
- Yeah.

549
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,056
- Can you believe that thunder?
- No.

550
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,093
That storm is so fierce.
I've never seen anything like it.

551
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,890
- I haven't either.
- Imagine being out there.

552
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:15,330
(gasps)
That last one sounded really close.

553
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,528
Don't worry- lightning never
strikes in the same place twice.

554
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,303
- Where's Rachel?
- I thought she was with you.

555
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,672
(thunder crashing)

556
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,412
Oh, there you are.

557
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,186
Okay. That's it. We're fine.

558
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,783
That last bolt of lightning
smelled like a-

559
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,021
Giant turd.

560
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:49,089
Yes, the... lightning.

561
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,658
I'll go look for Robbie.

562
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,599
MAN: Turn it again,
see if it'll start.

563
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,803
MAN 2: I don't know what's going on.
The car's not working, it's just not working.

(skateboarder grunts)

567
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,355
My bowels have stopped moving!
Why?

568
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,516
- How's it going, Marvin?
- I just had this car working; now it's dead.

569
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,186
- Try changing the solenoid.
- Good idea.

570
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,525
(yelling)
Death to America!

571

572
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,698

Thanks.
(screams)

591
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,447

(gasps, screams)

596
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,329
Hello?

597
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,469

610
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,814
I can't read that.

611
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,444

612
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,323

What is it?
What's going on?

617
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,866
Death.

618
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,038

620
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,576
- Dad, talk to me. What's happening?
- There's no time to explain.

621
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,382
Alien attack!

622
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:33,321
Well, actually,
that about sums it up.

623
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,825
Fill this up with food.
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

- Run for it!
- Where are you going?

630
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:01,383
Someone's out there, somebody
who knows a way to stop all of this.

631
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,545
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

632
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,113
- Come with me.
- Oh, I'd like to, but my kids.

633
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,092
I... guess this is good-bye.

634
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,653
When this is all over, promise me that
you'll find me, that you'll never forget me...

635
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,632
that you won't give up
until I'm back in your arms.

636
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,033
- Alive?
- Yes.

637
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,866
I promise.

638
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,069
Good-bye, Cindy.

639
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,374
(gasping, stammering)

640
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,810
Hey, wait!

641
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,614
A solenoid... for luck.

642
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,752
(dog barking)

643
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,789
Marvin!
You put a solenoid in?

644
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,199
Yeah, I got one
from that crackhead over there.

645
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,931
- Get in.
- Why should we?

646
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,839
Because you're my responsibility now,
and like it or not, I'm all you've got.

647
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,877
(screams)
Ow!

648
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,143
- Hey. Hey!
- Thank God.

649
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,342
Hey! What are you doing?

650
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,352
- Get in the car, Marvin.
- Come on, Tom, stop joking around.

651
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,945
Get in the car, Marvin,
or you're gonna die.

652
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,423
Okay, fine.

653
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,195
- No, wait for me to-
- Still locked.

654
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,858
- Why are you reaching at the same time?
- What do you mean?

655
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,730
- All right, on three.
- You counting now?

656
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,827
One, two, three, open the door!

657
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,236
- Okay, on three.
- One, two-

658
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,002
(both)
Three.

659
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,373
- Don't do that. You're trying to annoy me.
- It's still locked.

660
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,435
I'm going on three. One, two-

661
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,105
Don't count when I count.
I have a problem with that.

662
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,978
- What's the matter with you?
- Turn your mouth sideways.

663
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,245
- If you look at me I lose count.
- What are you crazy?

664
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,651
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

665
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,053
- Don't do it the same time.
- You said ''three.''

666
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,647
- You go on ''four.'' Can you count?
- Four.

667
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,159
- So on your ''three'' or my ''four''?
- There's only one ''three.''

668
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,525
- I'm tryin' to get in the car.
- Then you do it on ''four.''

669
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,292
You said, ''three.'' So are you doin' it
on ''three'' or am I doin' it on ''two''?

670
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,197
- For Christ's sake!
- I heard ''three.''

671
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,826
If the count is ''three,''
you do it on ''four.''

672
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,495
- Now it's ''four.''
- Why would you go on ''four''?

673
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,436
You gave me ''four'' first
and you stole my ''four.''

674
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,167
- But I have to count to ''three'' first.
- You stole my ''four.''

675
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,641
-Just let me say ''three.''
- I've got wait on you now, huh?

676
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,269
- You want the black man to wait again?
- Do whatever you want.

677
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,281
- That's what I've been doin'.
- Why would you do that?

678
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,874
Why would you reach for it when
I say ''three''? That's what this is about.

679
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,418
Do I still go on ''four''?

680
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,681
When I say ''three,''
don't worry about ''four.''

681
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,188
You got all the time in the world!

682
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:23,352
You can go home, watch television
and come back and then open the door!

683
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,621
- Fine.
- One-

684
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,255
No. No ''one.'' I'm out.
No thank you.

685
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,892
I'll take the next one.
Does that work for you?

686
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,198
-Jesus.
- Attitude.

687
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,238
(tires screech)

688
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,069
Seriously, I'd rather be dead.

689
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,631
(screams, debris clatters)

690
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,270
GI RL (voice-over):
''A girl had a pet duck.

691
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,540
''She fed and took care
of her pet duck.

692
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:48,278
''But one day, the duck got loose
and ran away from the girl.

693
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,912
''The duck ran down the road
and kept running...

694
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,649
until he found a pond.''

695
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,352
Mr. President,
we've just received word...

696
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,725
the planet is under attack by aliens.

697
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,388
Oh. Okay.

698
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,227
''The duck went back''-

699
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,200
Sir? They've already wiped out
some of our cities.

700
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,669
If nothing is done,
they'll kill us all.

701
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,933
I see. Well, I'll handle that
in a minute.

702
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,602
But right now, I need to find out
what's happening with the duck.

703
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:17,408
Sir, with each passing moment,
more people will die.

704
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,915
The people are gonna die
regardless...

705
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,578
but this duck still has
a fighting chance.

706
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:27,317
(sighs)
I've read the story before, Mr. President.

707
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,416
The duck dies.

708
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,858
(groaning)

709
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,419
My God!
That's horrible.

710
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,523
Mr. President, the aliens?
We're under attack.

711
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,433
You mean, right now all of these
children's parents could be dead?

712
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:43,496
- (screaming)
- Kids! Kids, please!

713
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,940
It's not as bad as it seems.

714
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,605
They didn't die alone. I'm sure they
died with all the other people you loved.

715
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,546
Even Santa Claus?

716
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,586
No, of course not.
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.

717
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,525
Just like the Tooth Fairy,
completely made up.

718
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,952
Easter Bunny-
Never existed.

719
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,326
The female orgasm.

720
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,369
Wait and see what happens
when you try to find it.

721
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,372
What's wrong? Your parents
all getting divorces?

722
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,637
I can give them a little advice,
if you'd like.

723
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,543
Oh, I forgot.
They're all dead.

724
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,878
All right now, let's go on to
another story, ''Rumpelforeskin.''

725
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,646
''Stiltzkin,'' sir.
We have to get you to the White House.

726
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,380
I just don't get kids.

727
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,514
- Remind me to sign that abortion bill.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,130
(blades squeaking)

729
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,799
STEWARDESS: You may leave
through the forward exit doors...

730
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,136
or the gaping hole
in the side of the plane.

731
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,198
We realize you have
a choice in airlines...

732
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,439
and we appreciate
you flying with Southern Coast Air.

733
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,810
- Thank you.
- Hello?

734
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,039
(screams)

735
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,052
Hey! That's mine! I found it!

736
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,185
- Cindy?
- Brenda?

737
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,750
Oh, my God.
It's been so long.

738
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,228
Yeah, too long.

739
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,197
I thought you were dead.

740
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,257
Oh, I thought
you were dead, too.

741
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,734
What are you doing here?
Were you on this plane?

742
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,862
No, I'm trying to get a good story.

743
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,669
I'm a reporter now.
I work for the local news.

744
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,334
Wow, you're really doing
well for yourself.

745
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,937
I was on assignment.
Take a look at this.

746
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,709
Here's Detroit.

747
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,409
(sirens blaring, gunfire)

748
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,009
And here's Detroit after the attack.

749
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,680
(sirens blaring, gunfire)

750
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,553
Oh, my God.

751
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,286
The attack was devastating.

752
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,056
It's over, Cindy.
Humanity has lost the war.

753
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,121
No, no. There's still hope.

754
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,996
I have reason to believe that there's
someone here that has the answers...

755
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,333
maybe even a way for us to fight back.

756
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,738
Come on.
It would make a great story.

757
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,140
Maybe. But how are
we supposed to get there?

758
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,144
None of these cars work.

759
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,077
Wait. See if this works.

760
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,012
(horn honks)

761
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,383
Hey! I got the last working car
in New York!

762
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,389
This is our road, bitches! Ha-ha!

763
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,359
(shouts)

764
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,054
(horn honking)

765
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,824
You're right, Cindy.
That worked pretty well.

766
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,229
I-

767
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,168
(people moaning)

768
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,107
CI NDY:
Look at all the injured.

769
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,770
It's so sad.

770
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,538
Big-ass rat, man!

771
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,517
Oh! That sewer took forever to fix!

772
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,281
Man, I'm gonna need
a hot bath after all of that-

773
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,016
What the hell happened here?

774
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,388
(moaning and wailing)

775
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,290
- Zombies!
- Damn!

776
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,763
(groans)

777
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,231
Let's go!

778
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,631
(grunts)

779
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,362
Don't let 'em bite you!

780
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,234
Good news!
They can still feel electricity.

781
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,434
Grandma?
The zombies have got my grandma!

782
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,239
Die, Grandma! Die! Die!

783
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,975
- I loved you! I loved you!
- Mahalik?

784
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,415
Look what they did
to my grandmama!

785
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,886
Whoa! (screaming)

786
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,252
(distant splash)

787
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,257
That woman raised me from birth.

788
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,885
( crickets chirping)

789
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,831
MAN:
Hey, he's got a car. He's got a car.

790
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,893
Give us the car and the keys!

791
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,566
This isn't my car.
I would, but I can't. It's not my car.

792
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:41,475
It's not my car. Don't worry, kids.
The doors are locked.

793
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,240
There's no possible way they can-

794
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,908
Pull the robot out of chocolate.
But that's just common sense. Oh, waiter!

795
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,144
( clamoring)

796
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,448
- Daddy!
- Kids!

797
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,148
(screams)

798
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,619
HANG-GLI DI NG MAN:
Whoa!

799
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,960
Why?

800
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,090
Well.

801
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,136
Get back! Get back!

802
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,501
(screams)

803
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,062
(gun cocks)

804
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,734
Gimme the gun.
I'm taking the car.

805
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,801
What do I do about him?

806
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,210
I don't want the car.
I just need a gun.

807
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,545
No way I'm giving up the gun.
I want the car.

808
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:23,609
So, you need a gun,
and you want a car.

809
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,884
- What do you want?
- Well, I've never owned a knife.

810
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,619
Okay. Let's all switch on three.

811
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,560
One, two, three.

812
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,533
Is this right?

813
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,728
I don't think so.

814
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,499
Dad, they're taking the car.

815
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,238
Yes, well, uh, let's keep going.

816
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,247
What?
That's it? You're giving up?

817
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,647
Yeah, that's right. I'm giving up.

818
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,049
You want a hero?
Go find someone else.

819
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,520
(groans)
Why?

820
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,551
Let's go.

821
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,992
PRESI DENT:
Now, let me get this straight:

822
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:08,964
The girl hugged the duck,
and then it dies?

823
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,592
Mr. President,
the nation is under attack.

824
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,363
Get me Homer Landsquiddy.

825
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,928
You mean, ''Homeland Security.''

826
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,204
Sir, this woman was an eyewitness
to one of the attacks.

827
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,871
- What can you tell us?
- They're indestructible.

828
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,608
The clothing was burned off
everyone's bodies.

829
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,310
There were naked people
everywhere.

830
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,853
- Were you naked?
- No.

831
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,718
Thank God.
Some good news at last.

832
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,621
Get her a souvenir.

833
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,037
(gasps, sighs)

834
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,577
(grunting)

835
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,206
Lil' Kim-
Lil' Kim got my sandwich.

836
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,447
Look out-
Russell Crowe's got a phone!

837
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,079
R. Kelly, don't pee on me!

838
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,249
My lovely lady lumps!

839
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,316
Where are we?

840
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:13,591
I'm not sure,
but I think we're close.

841
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,122
It's supposed to be near mile 62.

842
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,930
Is something wrong?

843
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,300
No, it's just...

844
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:24,807
I met this guy,
and I wonder if he's safe.

845
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,809
Oh, you'd love him, Brenda.

846
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,937
What's his name?
I might've already loved him.

847
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,776
Tom Ryan.

848
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,977
Yeah, did him.
Big, fat Chinese guy?

849
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,146
No... No.

850
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,589
But he is the kind of guy that I'd like
to share the rest of my life with.

851
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,592
- (shrieks)
- (screams)

852
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,659
(gasping)

853
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,755
Cindy! Look!

854
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,468
What is this place?

855
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,272
I don't know, but the boy's father's
somewhere in there.

856
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,279
We'll have to sneak our way in.

857
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,338
But we're not gonna
blend in dressed like this.

858
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,350
- Brenda, look.
- He's a wonderful boy.

859
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,748
(yelping)

860
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,951
(punching, grunting)

861
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,831
(groaning)

862
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,910
- (door creaking)
- WOMAN: Ezekiel?

863
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,916
Ezekiel, where are you?

864
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,247
(goofy laughter)

865
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,756
Ezekiel,
shall we have a foot race?

866
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,761
No cheating.

867
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,128
(laughing, grunts)

868
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,530
(indistinct conversations)

869
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,210
That's him!

870
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,585
- He's cute.
- (horn blows)

871
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:27,427
Friends, friends. Do not fear the noise
of those of whom we do not speak.

872
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,692
There is a gentle truce
between our village

873
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,291
and the creatures
beyond their borders.

874
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,234
Now, who would like to say grace?

875
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,204
Ooh!

876
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,104
Ah, Ezekiel.

877
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,400
Pee-pee.
( chuckling)

878
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,413
Pee-pee vagina.

879
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,743
ALL:
Amen.

880
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,585
(gasping)

881
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,123
- (grunts)
- Father?

882
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,858
Holly.

883
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,264
For what purpose
do you interrupt

884
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,737
the celebration
of the domestic partnership

885
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,103
of Mordecai and Hoss?

886
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,108
The guards caught
two outsiders near the cabin.

887
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,249
Who are you?

888
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,378
I must speak with you.
I was sent by your son.

889
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,513
Don't be ridiculous.

890
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,854
- I have no son.
- That's not true!

891
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,223
I know who you are.
I've seen the pictures.

892
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,422
- I was young. I needed the work.
- No.

893
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,090
At Mrs. Norris's house.

894
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,566
I didn't know whose house it was.

895
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,069
They drugged me.
Never mind that.

896
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:45,268
You're outsiders.
The council will decide your fates.

897
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,403
(gavel banging)

898
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,908
The question of the outsiders
is now at hand.

899
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:58,580
But first, Martha,
have you some tidings?

900
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,021
Nathaniel Winston
and Alice Smith

901
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:03,059
have informed me
of their intentions.

902
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,323
He intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible.

903
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,457
She intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in.

904
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,001
(villagers murmuring)

905
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,999
Amos, something does trouble you?

906
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:25,447
We now have a majority
of those who wish to say ''I'm''...

907
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,847
instead of''I am.''

908
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,250
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

909
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,686
- (gavel rapping)
- Silence!

910
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,622
We have more important matters
to discuss.

911
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,150
I fear that the presence
of the outsiders

912
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:42,687
will attract those of whom
we do not speak.

913
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,963
If you talk about those
of whom we do not speak...

914
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,334
have you not spoken of that

915
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,202
about which we do not talk?

916
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,208
Do not speak of that
of about which

917
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:58,077
we talk of not speaking...
about.

918
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,053
Elder Hale. We should welcome
the outsiders among us.

919
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,586
Jeremiah, ought not
your tongue be held?

920
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,394
I am sorry, Elder Hale...

921
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,665
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it.

922
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,501
(gasping)

923
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:27,373
This is a problem with which
I have had much experience.

924
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,538
Maybe I could help him in a room
in which there are no others.

925
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,145
Or you can all watch.
I don't give a shit.

926
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,050
- (gasping)
- Silence.

927
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,683
(breathing heavily)

928
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:45,217
After this, how about you take
your thing of which we do not speak...

929
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,490
and slide it up in my place
of which I like-

930
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,498
Silence!

931
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,898
The elders will consult.

932
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,104
Ah. Much better.

933
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,786
(loudly passing gas)

934
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,951
(farting, gurgling)

935
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,963
(splashing, farting)

936
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,473
( clears throat)

937
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,204
(farting)

938
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:39,248
I'm not in my house, am I?

939
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,216
No.

940
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,377
(farts)

941
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:49,120
Outsiders, we have decided
to let you stay with us...

942
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,491
so that you'll be safe from
those from of whom we do not-

943
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,689
Or don't.

944
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,254
Speak.

945
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,359
But now that you are
a part of our village...

946
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,495
understand this:

947
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,698
you may never leave.

948
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:07,004
No! No!

949
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,602
How did your son die?

950
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,204
- The fate of the world is at stake.
- You know what to do.

951
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:13,943
Was it you? Did you kill him?

952
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,951
This is some shit
up with which we will not put.

953
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,510
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

954
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,790
(moaning, slurping)

955
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:25,123
This village isn't
what it used to be.

956
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,897
Just hours after
the devastating alien attack...

957
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:34,266
world leaders have gathered
at the United Nations.

958
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,033
In this, mankind's darkest hour...

959
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,439
the human race has turned, as one...

960
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,443
to the wisdom and leadership

961
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:44,036
of the President
of the United States.

962
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:48,050
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

963
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,086
Go get 'em, tiger.

964
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,144
They mean you, sir.

965
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,019
Oh, yes, of course.

966
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,454
( clears throat)

967
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:07,231
So... an Indian, a Frenchman
and the Pope are all on a plane.

968
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,206
The pilot says,
''Hey, are any of you not circumcised?''

969
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,209
So the Pope lifts up
his robe and says...

970
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,973
''Shut up, stupid.
You don't even speak English.''

971
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,514
(laughing)

972
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,913
The Israeli asked theJapanese guy
to open his eyes...

973
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,418
but theJapanese man says,
''I'm not squinting, you crazyJew.

974
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,853
You're the one who sold me
these cheap glasses.''

975
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,585
What's the difference between
a Belgian and a lump of dog shit?

976
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,220
The Belgian drinks wine,
but the dog shit smells good.

977
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,561
(President laughing)

978
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:41,536
But, on a serious note,
I'm here today at the, uh...

979
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,103
''un''... because the Earth
has been attacked.

980
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,042
I'm happy to report that we may
have found a way to fight back.

981
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,602
My military advisers
at the Pentagram

982
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,443
have managed
to do the impossible.

983
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,178
They have captured one
of the alien heat ray guns.

984
00:55:56,252 --> 00:56:00,518
As you know, the heat ray destroys the body,
leaving behind nothing but clothes.

985
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,753
Our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon

986
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:07,126
in the hopes that it can now
be turned against

987
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,256
the alien invaders.

988
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,562
- (gasping)
- Well, where was I?

989
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,802
Ah, yes. We expect that the
alien shields will be vulnerable

990
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,367
to this reconfigured weapon.

991
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,276
( clamoring)

992
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,714
- People, please! Please!
- (shocked gasping)

993
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:33,120
Please, people. Now, I know that this
new technology may seem frightening...

994
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:36,625
but I believe that deep down
inside this heat cannon

995
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,126
is our best chance.

996
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,628
Let me give you a demonstration.

997
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,393
Now let's see if this thing
is plugged in.

998
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,900
(groaning)

999
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,130
Uh... it's not a very pretty sight.

1000
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,468
Everything's loose
and flapping around.

1001
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,508
Look at this little pink thing.

1002
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,544
(retching)

1003
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,477
(grunting)

1004
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,609
Someone get some lubricant,
and we'll slather it around in here.

1005
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,017
There.

1006
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,921
(screaming)

1007
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,117
(shrieking)

1008
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,863
Harper. Good God,
these people are all naked.

1009
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,304
Have you no shame?
Have you no decency?

1010
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,638
- Sir, you're naked, too.
- I am?

1011
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,371
- I thought this was a wrinkly leather coat.
- Sir!

1012
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,038
- These aren't buttons?
- No!

1013
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,446
I've been pulling this thing
up and down like a zipper.

1014
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,177
Mr. President, please.

1015
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,685
- (farts)
- There goes that duck again.

1016
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,694
Yo, man, you see this red weed?

1017
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,753
( coughs)
Nope.

1018
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,765
Dad, how much further till Mom's?

1019
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,664
I don't know.

1020
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:54,328
I'm not sure how much longer
I can carry your sister.

1021
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,703
I've been walking
this entire time.

1022
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,368
- Then who the hell is-
- I'll pay you.

1023
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,037
- (gasps)
- Stay close, Rachel.

1024
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,548
- Dad, look!
- (screaming)

1025
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,414
Hey! Hey! You guys!
I want to help!

1026
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,420
Robbie! Oh, no.

1027
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:16,423
Don't move. For God's sake,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

1028
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,485
Hey! Hey, you guys!
I want to help.

1029
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,826
(screams)

1030
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,661
Awesome!

1031
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,327
- Wait!
- Are you crazy?

1032
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,529
No!
They'll pay for half my college.

1033
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,867
(screaming)

1034
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,804
Kick ass.

1035
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,706
Robbie!

1036
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,710
- Yes!
- What's the matter with you?

1037
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,043
Hey, look at that guy.
This is so cool!

1038
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,848
Robbie! Robbie!

1039
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,851
Rachel! Rachel!

1040
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,227
Little girl, are you alone?

1041
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,357
You need to come with me.

1042
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,424
I'll keep you safe, right, kids?

1043
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:00,935
KI DS:
Uh-uh.

1044
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,063
- Do you have a little brother?
- Get away from her!

1045
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,472
(deep, booming trumpeting)

1046
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,204
Run away, kids!

1047
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,740
Toward the tripod,
if you have to!

1048
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,145
Don't go! I've got a Ferris wheel
and a chimp...

1049
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,650
and a big, soft bed
we can all get in.

1050
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:20,121
(panting)

1051
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,589
No, please!

1052
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,956
Not my real face!

1053
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,892
Not my real face!

1054
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,987
No!

1055
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,563
(rapid gunfire, explosions)

1056
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,228
Over here.

1057
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,399
Follow me to safety.

1058
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,602
- Ow!
- Follow me to safety.

1059
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,613
- I don't know about this.
- I'm an excellent judge of character.

1060
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,172
All right. Yeah.

1061
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,915
(owl hooting)

1062
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,271
(man, woman breathing heavily)

1063
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,277
MAN:
That's it.

1064
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,573
Oh, Brenda.

1065
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:21,015
Yes! You did it!
(laughs)

1066
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,781
You have learned quickly
and produced splendid butter.

1067
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:27,322
Are you sure you have not
churned before?

1068
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,881
Well, we don't call it churning
where I come from.

1069
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,586
(bell tolling)

1070
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,195
(man shouting)

1071
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,397
Pee-pee vagina.

1072
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,959
(grunts)

1073
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,709
( creaking sound)

1074
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,611
( chuckles, grunting)

1075
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,517
Quick! Into the cellar.

1076
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:58,110
No!

1077
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:01,213
This is the cellar.
That's the cesspool.

1078
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,882
Damn it!

1079
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,759
Quick!

1080
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,043
(sneezes)

1081
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,575
(gasps)

1082
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,118
BOTH:
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

1083
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,347
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

1084
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,255
Hey! You're not monsters.

1085
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,085
Old Lady Henderson?

1086
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:41,562
And Pig-FaceJoe!

1087
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,690
(woman screaming)

1088
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,634
What happened?

1089
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,195
It is Henry.

1090
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,833
He has suffered a heart attack

1091
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,900
brought on by this knife.

1092
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,245
Who did this?

1093
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,248
It was... Ezekiel.

1094
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,076
Henry, you need a hospital.

1095
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,644
It's not too late.
We can help you.

1096
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,851
Perhaps you could start by
not leaning on the knife.

1097
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,588
(gasps)

1098
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,623
Do not be concerned for him,
Cindy.

1099
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:18,155
We have sent our most qualified
villager for medicines.

1100
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,238
I am so dead.

1101
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:35,910
Please, leave me alone
with Cindy and Brenda.

1102
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,577
I have much to tell them.

1103
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,016
Listen carefully to me.

1104
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,083
I am not long for this world.

1105
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,129
- Pussy.
- Brenda!

1106
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,996
What? 50 Cent got shot nine times.
He's still walking around.

1107
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:54,127
Tell me, Henry, who killed the boy?
Was it you?

1108
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:58,037
No, I loved him and his mother
very much.

1109
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,098
I should have been with him
when he died.

1110
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,440
It was horrible.

1111
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,537
What happened?
You must tell me.

1112
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,775
They went to a boxing match.

1113
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,283
It was a women's
championship title fight.

1114
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,586
And there was
a terrible accident.

1115
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,817
Oh, my God.

1116
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:26,634
(yelling)

1117
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,636
Only in America!

1118
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:31,070
(bones cracking)

1119
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:36,038
All this time, I've been
searching for his killer

1120
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,080
when it was me, Brenda.

1121
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,081
It was all my fault.

1122
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,879
Henry, your son told me
that if I found his killer...

1123
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,920
I would know how
to defeat the aliens.

1124
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,922
And he was right.
Don't you see?

1125
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,118
All you have to do is-
(screams)

1126
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:52,855
( chuckling)

1127
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,523
Who the hell
let his ass out of jail?

1128
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,362
His brother, the sheriff.

1129
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,665
(goofy laughter)

1130
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,706
Fuckin' ''A.''

1131
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,205
(gunfire, explosions in distance)

1132
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:11,842
(softly)
There you go, sweetie.

1133
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,848
We're gonna die, aren't we?

1134
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:18,046
Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you.
I haven't lost anyone yet.

1135
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,578
- You've lost Robbie.
- Except Robbie.

1136
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:26,060
None of that matters right now.
What's important is that I'm here with you.

1137
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,062
Try and get some sleep, okay?

1138
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,391
Sing me
''Lullaby and Good Night''?

1139
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,535
I don't know that one.

1140
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,130
Sing me ''Hushabye Mountain''?

1141
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,266
I'm sorry, Rachel,
I don't that one, either.

1142
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,579
(sighs)

1143
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,988
(off-key)
#You want this money #

1144
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,489
#Then you gotta be a bad bitch #

1145
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,720
# Shake that ass for a tip
if you a bad bitch #

1146
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:04,254
# Drop down to the floor
if you a bad bitch #

1147
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,995
# Oh, no, she ain't no ho #

1148
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,435
# She a bad... bitch #

1149
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,905
(loud snoring)

1150
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:19,447
Hey. Come on in.

1151
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,109
Have a seat.

1152
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:25,176
- The name's Oliver.
- Tom Ryan.

1153
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,887
I found this place.
Plenty of food-

1154
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,727
Along with two freshly killed
busybodies upstairs...

1155
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:36,993
who ''owned'' the place.
We could stay here forever.

1156
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,830
- Are you afraid?
- Of course I'm afraid.

1157
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,063
I'm not.
I've been around death plenty.

1158
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,629
I used to drive an ambulance
in the city...

1159
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,302
but, apparently, I wasn't
a very strong driver.

1160
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,709
It seems I was killing more people
than I was saving.

1161
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,476
Something about that siren
got me excited.

1162
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:57,110
Wham! Carnage.

1163
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,620
But this is different.
This is a war.

1164
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,987
No, it's an extermination.

1165
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,822
It's no more of a war than there's a war
between men and maggots...

1166
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,226
or dragons and wolves...

1167
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:11,426
or men riding dragons,
throwing wolves at maggots.

1168
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,197
Damn it, Tom. Can't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

1169
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,762
These aliens must have a weakness.

1170
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,240
I heard that theJaps killed
a few of'em over in Kikkoman.

1171
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,142
Kikkoman.
That's-That's soy sauce.

1172
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:24,975
Right, yeah. Low sodium.

1173
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:28,210
What I'm trying to say, Tom, is that you
and I should be fighting these things.

1174
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,684
It's us that should be coming up
from under the ground.

1175
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:32,812
Of course, we'll have to
bury ourselves first...

1176
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,219
but it'll be worth it.

1177
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,417
Cool breeze. No sunblock. Worms.

1178
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,484
When we build our own tripods,
they'll have four legs.

1179
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,530
I gotta show ya something.

1180
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,892
We'll tunnel up from behind
and scare the piss out of'em.

1181
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,399
Wish we had some shovels,
don't you?

1182
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,969
(whirring)

1183
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,248
( electronic tones)

1184
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,817
(whispers)
Dad.

1185
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,780
(laughing)

1186
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,951
( contented sigh)

1187
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,390
(screams)
Daddy!

1188
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,085
Rachel!

1189
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,559
(Rachel screaming)

1190
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:23,462
Rachel! Rachel!

1191
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,296
(screaming)

1192
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,462
(owl hooting)

1193
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,743
What's the secret, Brenda?
What am I missing?

1194
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,870
(bell clanging)

1195
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,916
Oh, please!
More fake monsters?

1196
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,612
(deep trumpeting)

1197
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:52,453
- Cindy!
- (screaming)

1198
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,194
(people screaming)

1199
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,928
(man yelling)

1200
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,430
(screaming)

1201
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,170
(gasping)

1202
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,441
(muffled)
Help! Help!

1203
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,807
- I promised I'd find you, didn't I?
- (gasps)

1204
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,396
Where are we?
What is this?

1205
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,528
Some kind of basket
attached to the tripod.

1206
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,265
Jesus!

1207
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,240
I know, it's horrible.
But why?

1208
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,140
What are the aliens
gonna do to us?

1209
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,145
I don't know,
but they're taking everyone-

1210
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,909
young, old, rich, poor, Chingy.

1211
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,974
# Let's ride,
then I drop the top #

1212
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:53,078
(gasping)

1213
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,186
- Daddy!
- Rachel!

1214
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:03,663
- No!
- Daddy! Help!

1215
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:05,632
Tom!

1216
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,102
(screaming)

1217
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,139
(pants)
Am I dead?

1218
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,307
BRENDA:
You're not dead.

1219
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:26,215
(gasping)

1220
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,951
(gasping)

1221
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,459
- Brenda!
- Cindy!

1222
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:35,326
Hey... could be worse.

1223
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,398
- You want to switch?
- Okay.

1224
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,371
Brenda, look!

1225
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,035
BRENDA: I don't believe it!
The aliens killed a dinosaur!

1226
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,975
(footsteps thundering)

1227
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:56,310
DISTORTED MALE VOICE: Hello, humans.
Welcome to the inside of the command tripod.

1228
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,587
Where's Rachel? What have
you done with my daughter?

1229
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:03,523
All in good time, Tom.
But first, I want to play a game.

1230
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:07,392
The devices you wear
will trigger in 60 seconds.

1231
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:11,923
The switch on the wall
behind Cindy will disable them.

1232
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,866
But where is the key?

1233
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,528
I'll give you a hint, Cindy.

1234
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,701
Let the game begin.

1235
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,505
I... I don't get it.

1236
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:27,208
Okay...
maybe this will help you ''see.''

1237
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:37,751
You want me to... cut something?

1238
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,091
That should be obvious, yes.

1239
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,599
No.

1240
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:49,761
No! (growls)
The key is behind your eye, okay?

1241
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:52,830
(Cindy gasps)

1242
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:59,111
Zoltar, get in here!
This one's gonna do it!

1243
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,076
(squishing, then pop)

1244
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,416
Fake eye.

1245
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,819
Bad bar fight in '96.

1246
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,551
(all gasp)

1247
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:14,061
- Oh.
- (squishing)

1248
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,154
(panting)

1249
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:20,167
Oh... oh, I hope this doesn't
come between us.

1250
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,226
Of course not.

1251
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,333
- (squishy squeak)
- (sighs)

1252
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,639
Is it too late
for me to try this on?

1253
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,579
Silence!
The game is not yet over.

1254
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,015
(whirring, clanking)

1255
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,746
- Rachel!
- Daddy!

1256
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,254
- Robbie!
- RACHEL: Daddy!

1257
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,425
The only thing keeping
your children alive, Tom, is you.

1258
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,988
Well, we had a good run.

1259
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,697
(both screaming)

1260
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,332
Ha! You weren't expecting that,
were you?

1261
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,341
On the contrary,
I was counting on it.

1262
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,811
I call it... ''the nutcracker.''

1263
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,818
Why?

1264
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,616
(grunts)
(strained) Of course.

1265
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:24,459
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

1266
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,327
(sloshing)

1267
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,668
Oh, my- Oh, my gosh.

1268
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:34,334
Of course. Follow the blood.
Henry was his stepdad.

1269
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,901
You're the little boy's real father!

1270
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,879
Where did you even meet her?

1271
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,415
ALI EN:
It was spring break in Cabo. So what?

1272
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,815
I blended in.
Seriously, who gives a crap?

1273
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:45,217
What's this?

1274
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,657
Enjoy your purple nurple, Tom.

1275
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,522
(groaning)

1276
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,021
Please, your son
wouldn't want this.

1277
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,895
His soul walks the Earth because
of the pain you've caused him.

1278
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:00,594
No. I have crossed a galaxy
for revenge.

1279
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,864
But it's my fault.
Let the others go.

1280
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,101
Oh, I don't think so.
Look upon him as he writhes!

1281
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,576
Hey, Cindy!
Look, I'm on TV, y'all! Check it out!

1282
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,738
I'm gonna give a shout out
to all my peeps!

1283
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,112
(gasps)

1284
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,878
BRENDA:
Have you lost your mind?

1285
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,385
No one... bitch slaps... Brenda!

1286
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,615
Zoltar, help!

1287
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,125
Oh, oh!
This is some bullshit!

1288
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,560
I know you hold a grudge against humanity
for your son's death, but-

1289
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,961
Oh, wet willy!

1290
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:33,263
(gasps) Killing us won't bring
your little boy back.

1291
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:36,236
No. You will all pay
for what you have done.

1292
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,398
Besides,
I've already built this thing.

1293
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,902
When the trap closes on you,
it will lock the chain in place.

1294
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,969
Your children will be saved...

1295
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,641
but you will suffer a terrible death.

1296
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,378
Can you hang on
to the ones you love?

1297
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,579
You have 60 seconds.

1298
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,087
(metal creaking)

1299
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,819
- No.
- Don't worry, kids. I won't quit on you.

1300
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,295
It's okay to let go, Dad.

1301
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:03,923
All you ever had to do
was show that you loved me.

1302
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,464
And show me what it means
to be a man.

1303
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:10,061
And show me
that I could love again.

1304
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,969
We forgive you, Dad.

1305
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:16,101
(metal creaking, chains clanking)

1306
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,668
(gasps)

1307
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,116
(metallic creaking)

1308
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,154
The spikes- they stopped!

1309
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,191
- Kids!
- Daddy!

1310
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,501
Are you... sparing our lives?

1311
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,502
Anyone can hold a grudge...

1312
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,868
but it takes real courage to forgive.

1313
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:47,875
- The invasion is over.
- And?

1314
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:51,003
And I guess I'm sorry or something.
I don't know.

1315
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,706
Like you mean it.

1316
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,715
(sighing)
Okay.

1317
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,377
I'm sorry for killing millions of people.
Whatever!

1318
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,114
Wait... where's Brenda?

1319
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,351
BRENDA:
What?

1320
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:06,826
We're at peace now.
I was just sealing the deal.

1321
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:11,429
Come on, Brenda. Let's go.

1322
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,402
Bye, Zoltar!
Don't lose my number!

1323
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:19,497
Tell me you didn't catch something.

1324
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,476
Nah, it's cool.
She said she was a virgin.

1325
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,046
We are so fucked.

1326
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,709
( engines powering down)

1327
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,198
Mommy!

1328
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:50,368
Thank you.

1329
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,503
Hey, look, kids- Grandpa.

1330
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,207
No, that's my new husband.

1331
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,911
(passionate moaning)

1332
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:09,617
Oh, I think it's romantic-
the way love can find anyone.

1333
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:16,986
JAMES EARLJONES (voice-over):
And so, love triumphed in the end...

1334
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,363
and the invaders were destroyed.

1335
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:22,164
For this world, our world...

1336
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,205
- is the world of man.
- ( crying)

1337
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:27,298
We have earned the right
to live here...

1338
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:31,745
and as long as we love,
humanity will prevail.

1339
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,647
Each of our enemies has failed
in their quest to defeat us...

1340
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:40,450
each has been undone
by their own nefarious plans.

1341
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:43,980
Among all worlds,
across all galaxies...

1342
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:47,722
we stand above, we stand alone.

1343
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:52,426
None can threaten our existence,
none can challenge our spirit.

1344
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,435
And why?

1345
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,802
Of all the qualities
that make us unique...

1346
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,535
it is love that is
our greatest strength...

1347
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:03,237
and because of love, mankind-

1348
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,210
( cheering and applause)

1349
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:10,513
Thank you.
Hello, and welcome to the show.

1350
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:14,351
We have got a very special man
with some very special news.

1351
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,654
That's right- he's in the building!
The man who saved the world!

1352
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,990
Put your hands together
for Tom Ryan!

1353
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,586
(wild cheering)

1354
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:25,659
- Yes!
- My best friend.

1355
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,528
( cheering continues)

1356
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:34,540
(laughs)

1357
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:36,873
Whoo!

1358
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,810
( cheering continues)

1359
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,440
(laughing)

1360
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:44,314
- Wow.
- That's it?

1361
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,081
Okay.

1362
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:49,146
(laughing)

1363
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,659
- So, you're in love.
- I am. I'm in love.

1364
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,698
(laughing)

1365
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,733
(audience laughing)

1366
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,200
He's lost it.
The boy's lost it.

1367
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,897
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1368
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,998
(screeches)

1369
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,475
(whoops, laughs)

1370
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,138
- You are adorable when you are in love.
- Thank you.

1371
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:15,513
- Tell us all about her.
- She's great. She's really terrific.

1372
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,245
So it's complicated.

1373
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,583
Yeah, you were saying
that-that she's complex, I guess.

1374
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,485
Shut up!

1375
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,261
( crowd cheering)

1376
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,363
- Ow!
- You're insane. Tom Ryan is insane!

1377
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,460
- I'm insane!
- Are you happy?

1378
