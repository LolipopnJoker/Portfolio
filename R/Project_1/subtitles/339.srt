AMERICAN MINISTRY OF MAGIC

2
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,717
NEW YORK, 1927

3
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:29,599
You'll be glad to be rid of him, I expect.

4
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,414
We'd be more than happy to
keep him here in custody.

5
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:34,376
Six months are enough.

6
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:37,364
It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.

7
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:40,609
President Picquery, Mr. Spielman, sir.

8
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,283
Prisoner is secured and ready
to travel.

9
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,680
You've thrown everything at him, I see.

10
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:54,450
It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.

11
00:01:55,742 --> 00:02:00,816
We've had to change his
guard three times, he's very... persuasive.

12
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:02,764
So we removed his tongue.

13
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:10,125
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

14
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:14,071
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

15
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:18,769
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

16
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:32,769
The wizarding community worldwide owes
you a great debt, Madam President.

17
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,354
Do not underestimate him.

18
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:41,738
Mr. Spielman, we found
his wand hidden away.

19
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:46,149
Abernathy?

20
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,315
And we found this.

21
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,109
No more silver tongue, hmm?

22
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:01,110
You have joined a noble cause, my friend.

23
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:14,880
I know. I know. I know, Antonio

24
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,675
So needy.

FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD

00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:55,234
BRITISH MINISTRY OF MAGIC

27
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,203
THREE MONTHS LATER

28
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:32,959
They're ready for you, Newt.

29
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,191
Leta...

30
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,578
What are you doing here?

31
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:44,523
Theseus thought it would be good if I
became part of the Ministry family.

32
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,220
Did he actually say the
words “Ministry family”?

33
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,768
That sounds like my brother

34
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:10,623
Theseus was disappointed you
couldn't come to dinner.

35
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,055
Any of the nights we've asked you.

36
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,423
Well, I've been busy.

37
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:16,675
He's your brother, Newt.

38
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,523
He likes spending time with you.

39
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:20,773
And so do I.

40
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:28,436
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

41
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:32,659
Why do strange creatures love you so much?

42
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,118
- Well, there are no strange creatures...
- Only blinkered people!

43
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:42,854
How long did you get in detention
for saying that to Prendergast?

44
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,482
You know, I think it was a month that time.

45
00:09:45,857 --> 00:09:50,232
And I set off a Dung bomb under his desk
so I could join you, do you remember?

46
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,524
No, I actually don't remember that.

47
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,631
Hello.

48
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:03,573
Theseus. We were just talking
about Newt coming for dinner

49
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:04,931
Really? Well...

50
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,376
Look, before we go in there I

51
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,267
It's my fifth attempt, Theseus.
I know the form.

52
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,605
This isn't going to be like
the other times. This is...

53
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,697
Just try and
keep an open mind, will you?

54
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:19,027
- And maybe a little less.
- Like me?

55
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,876
Well, it can't hurt.
Come on. Let's go.

56
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:32,343
Hearing commences...

57
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,443
You want an end to the ban on your
traveling internationally. Why?

58
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:41,176
Because I like to
travel internationally.

59
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:46,402
Subject uncooperative and evasive on
reasons for last international trip.

60
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:48,068
It was a field trip.

61
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:51,157
So I was collecting material for
my book on magical beasts

62
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:52,842
You destroyed half of New York.

63
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:55,277
No, that's actually factually
incorrect on two counts

64
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:56,844
Newt!

65
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:59,490
Mr. Scamander...

66
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:04,356
it's clear you're frustrated
and, frankly, so are we.

67
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:09,986
In the spirit of compromise,
we'd like to make a proposition.

68
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:11,283
What kind of proposition?

69
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,554
The committee will agree to lift
your travel ban under one condition.

70
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:17,584
You join the Ministry.

71
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:21,441
Specifically, your brother's department.

72
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:25,743
No.

73
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,291
I-that isn't my kind of...

74
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,072
Theseus is the Auror...

75
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:33,596
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

76
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:35,753
Mr. Scamander. The wizarding
and non-wizarding

77
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,047
worlds have been at peace
for over a century.

78
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,805
Grindelwald wants to see that peace
destroyed.

79
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,063
And for certain members of our
community his message is very seductive.

80
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:52,779
Many pure-bloods believe it
is their birthright to rule

81
00:11:52,804 --> 00:11:56,686
not only our world but the
non-magic world as well.

82
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,235
They see Grindelwald as their hero,

83
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:03,716
and Grindelwald sees this boy

84
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,756
as a means
to make this all come true.

85
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:12,062
I'm sorry. You're talking about
Credence as if he were still here.

86
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,206
He survived, Newt.

87
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,496
He is still alive.

88
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,354
He left New York months ago.

89
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,763
He's somewhere in Europe. Where
exactly, we don't know, but...

90
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:26,272
And you want me to hunt Credence down?

91
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,414
To kill him?

92
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,498
Same old Scamander.

93
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,557
What's he doing here?

94
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,568
Taking on the job you're too soft to do.

95
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:42,946
Is that it?

96
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,708
Travel documentation denied.

97
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:53,896
Newt!

98
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,401
You think I like the idea of
Grimmson any more than you do?

99
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,646
Listen, I don't want to hear how
the ends justify the means, Theseus.

100
00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:01,107
I think you're gonna have to
pull your head out of the sand!

101
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:03,660
Okay, right, here we go. What a selfish...
irresponsible...

102
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:06,518
You know, the time is
coming when everyone's

103
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:10,027
everyone's gonna have to pick a side.
Even you.

104
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,658
I don't do sides.

105
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,962
Newt.

106
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:20,228
Newt.

107
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:26,077
C'mere.

108
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:34,799
They are watching you.

109
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,319
Well, gentlemen.

110
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:52,029
I assume this means
I have the job.

111
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:03,174
PARIS, FRANCE

112
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:42,098
Chérie?

113
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,516
Who's there?

114
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,990
This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.

115
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,759
I want you to
go to the circus now.

116
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:23,269
Give my note to Credence,

117
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:24,950
begin his journey.

118
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,507
When we've won, they'll flee
cities in the millions.

119
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,170
They've had their time.

120
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:33,116
We don't say such things out loud.

121
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:34,884
We want only freedom.

122
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,288
Freedom to be ourselves.

123
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,648
To annihilate non-wizards.

124
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,992
Not all of them. Not all.

125
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:44,375
We're not merciless.

126
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:48,804
The beast of burden
will always be necessary.

127
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,436
[London, UK]

128
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:57,779
Ventus.

129
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:41,407
Dumbledore.

130
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:47,287
Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?

131
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:51,313
I do enjoy a view.

132
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:53,297
Nebulus.

133
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:00,043
How was it?

134
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,637
They're still convinced that
you sent me to New York.

135
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:04,834
You told them I didn't?

136
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:05,835
Yes.

137
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,343
Even though you did.

138
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:13,046
You told me where to find
that trafficked Thunderbird,

139
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,011
Dumbledore. You knew that I
would take him home and you

140
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:16,567
knew I'd have to take him through
a Muggle port.

141
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:19,302
Well, I've always felt an affinity with
the great magical birds..

142
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,702
There's a story in my family

143
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:25,757
that a phoenix will come to any
Dumbledore who is in desperate need.

144
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:30,730
They say my great-great grandfather had
one, but that it took flight when he died,

145
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:32,389
never to return.

146
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,687
With all due respect, I
don't believe for a minute

147
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:38,320
that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.

148
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:46,614
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

149
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,860
He's trying to trace his real family.

150
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,281
I take it.

151
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:52,638
You've heard the rumors

152
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:53,784
about who he really is?

153
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:55,659
No.

154
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:07,302
The pure-bloods think he's
the last of an important French line,

155
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:11,901
a baby whom
everyone thought lost

156
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,286
- Not Leta's brother?
- That's what they're whispering.

157
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,864
Pure-blood or not, I know this...

158
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:21,931
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

159
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,328
as a dark twin, an only friend.

160
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,824
If Credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,

161
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:30,419
he might yet be saved.

162
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:36,212
Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's
either in danger or a danger to others.

163
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:39,279
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

164
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:43,951
And I rather hoped you might
be the one to find him.

165
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:50,554
What's that?

166
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:55,056
An address of a very
old acquaintance of mine.

167
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:59,434
A safe house in Paris,
reinforced with enchantments.

168
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,840
Safe house? Why would I
need a safe house in Paris?

169
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:04,505
One hopes you won't, but
should things at some point

170
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:07,017
go terribly wrong,
it's good to have a place to go.

171
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:09,444
You know, for a cup of tea.

172
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:12,358
No, no, no, absolutely not.

173
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,458
I'm banned from international
travel, Dumbledore.

174
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,554
If I leave the country, they will put
me in Azkaban and throw away the key.

175
00:20:18,555 --> 00:20:20,377
Do you know why I admire you, Newt?

176
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:21,398
What?

177
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,957
More, perhaps, than any
man I know?

178
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:30,050
You don't seek power or popularity.

179
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:35,709
You simply ask, is the thing
right in itself?

180
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,662
If it is, you do
it, no matter the cost.

181
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:42,603
That's all very well, Dumbledore,
but, forgive me for asking,

182
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:44,579
why can't you go?

183
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,418
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

184
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,716
It has to be you.

185
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,083
Well, I can't blame you,

186
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,932
in your shoes I'd probably refuse too.

187
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,215
- What...?
- It's late.

188
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:11,279
- Good evening, Newt.
- Wait. No!

189
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,417
Oh, come on.

190
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,769
Dumbledore.

191
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:36,471
Bunty!

192
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,890
Bunty!

193
00:22:45,187 --> 00:22:47,563
Bunty, the baby Nifflers are loose again!

194
00:22:58,197 --> 00:22:59,217
Well done

195
00:22:59,818 --> 00:23:00,568
I'm so sorry, Newt.

196
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:02,569
They must have picked the lock while I was
cleaning out the Augureys

197
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,608
Not to worry.

198
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:13,413
I've fed nearly everyone,
Pinky's had his nose drops, and

199
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:14,248
And Elsie?

200
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,674
- Elsie's droppings are nearly normal again.
- Wonderful.

201
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:20,807
You can clock off now...

202
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:26,467
- I told you to leave the Kelpie to me.
- That wound needs more ointment.

203
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:28,531
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

204
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:40,814
Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.

205
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,255
You must be exhausted.

206
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,683
You know the Kelpie's easier with two.

207
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:52,218
Perhaps you should take off your shirt?

208
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:57,932
Don't worry, I'll dry off quickly enough.

209
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:41,701
Someone needed to let off some steam.

210
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,314
Ointment, Bunty?

211
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,016
You bite Bunty again and
there'll be trouble, mister.

212
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:58,016
- What was that?
- I don't know.

213
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,793
But I want you to go home now, Bunty.

214
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:06,607
- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No, I want you to go home. Please.

215
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:16,327
If you could just give it to me...

216
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:18,859
Honey, if you could just give it to me.

217
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:21,982
- He doesn't care. Hold it.
- If you could just give it to me.

218
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,027
Hey...

219
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:33,668
NEWT! Get over here, you maniac.

220
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,105
We hope you don't mind, Newt?
We let ourselves in...

221
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:39,702
it's raining
out there-cats and dogs!

222
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:41,191
London's cold!

223
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:43,996
But you were supposed
to have been Obliviated!

224
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,431
I know!
It didn't work, pal.

225
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:49,832
I mean, you said it, the potion
only erases bad memories.

226
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,076
I didn't have any.

227
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:55,470
I mean, don't get me wrong, I had
some weird ones...

228
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,779
but this angel...

229
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:00,835
this angel over here, she filled
me in on all the bad parts.

230
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,468
And here we are, I guess, huh?

231
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,223
This is wonderful!

232
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:11,971
Is ...Tina?

233
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:14,551
Tina?

234
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,603
Oh it's just us, honey.

235
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,826
Me and Jacob.

236
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,588
Why don't I make us some dinner, huh?

237
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:25,614
Yes!

238
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:34,125
Tina and I aren't talking.

239
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,467
Why?

240
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,122
Oh well, you know, she
found out about Jacob and

241
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,614
I seeing each other and
she didn't like it,

242
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:42,152
cause of the “law.”

243
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:46,338
Not allowed oops, not
allowed to date No-Majs,

244
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,651
not allowed to marry them blah, blah, blah.

245
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:53,406
Well, she was all in a tizzy
anyway, 'cause of you.

246
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:54,591
Me?

247
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,393
Yeah, you, Newt.

248
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:58,461
It was in Spellbound.

249
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,406
Here-I brought it for you-

250
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:08,273
Newt Scamander with
fiancée, Leta Lestrange...

251
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:10,432
brother, Theseus
and unknown woman.

252
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,272
No. Theseus is marrying Leta, not me.

253
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:15,451
Oh!

254
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,251
Oh, oh dear.

255
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:21,467
Wah.

256
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:27,354
So Tina read that, and she started dating
someone else.

257
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,914
He's an Auror. His name's
Achilles Tolliver.

258
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,199
Tolliver?

259
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:41,941
Anyway... We're real
excited to be here, Newt.

260
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:45,461
This is a, oh
it's a special trip for us

261
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,314
You see, Jacob and I,

262
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:50,694
we're getting married.

263
00:27:53,785 --> 00:27:55,613
I'm marrying Jacob!

264
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,055
You've enchanted him, haven't you?

265
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:07,201
What?

266
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,922
I have not.

267
00:28:10,511 --> 00:28:12,432
Will you stop reading my mind?

268
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,229
Queenie, you've brought him
here against his will.

269
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:17,337
Oh, that is an
outrageous accusation.

270
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:21,370
Look at him. He's just happy.

271
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:23,243
Then you won't mind if I...

272
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,169
Please don't!

273
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,909
Queenie, you've got nothing to
fear if he wants to get married.

274
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,859
We can just lift the enchantment...
and he can tell us himself.

275
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:43,306
What you got there?

276
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:47,310
Whatchu gonna do? Whatchu gonna do with
that, Mr. Scamander?

277
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:48,572
<i>Surgito.</i>

278
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:02,124
Congratulations on
your engagement, Jacob.

279
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:03,149
Wait, what?

280
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,151
Oh no, you didn't.

281
00:29:11,494 --> 00:29:13,758
Queen. A second.

282
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:16,029
Queenie!

283
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:18,729
It's very nice to see you.

284
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,425
Where the hell am I right now?

285
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,426
Uh, uh, London.

286
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,314
Oh! I always wanted to go here!

287
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:26,735
Queenie!

288
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,667
Oh Queenie, honey.

289
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:36,030
Well, I'm just curious, when were you going
to wake me up? After we'd had five kids?

290
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,756
- Why is it wrong to want to marry you?
- Okay.

291
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:44,409
To wanna have a family?

292
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,244
I just want what everyone
else has, that's all.

293
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,391
Okay, wait..

294
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:53,151
We talked about this,
like, a million times.

295
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:54,868
If we get married and
they find out, they're

296
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:56,278
gonna throw you in
jail, sweetheart.

297
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,309
I can't have that.

298
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:01,718
They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.

299
00:30:01,818 --> 00:30:04,718
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

300
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:09,253
They're really progressive here, and
they'll let us get married properly.

301
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:11,808
Sweetheart, you don't need to enchant me.

302
00:30:12,304 --> 00:30:13,929
I'm already enchanted!

303
00:30:15,069 --> 00:30:17,068
I love you so much.

304
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:18,777
- Yeah??
- Yeah.

305
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,281
But I can't have you risking
everything like this, you know?

306
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:25,157
You're not giving us a choice, sweetheart.

307
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:30,012
You're not givin' me a choice.

308
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:33,769
One of us had to be brave, and you
were being a coward!

309
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,656
I was being a coward?

310
00:30:36,974 --> 00:30:39,915
If I'm a coward, you're...

311
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,503
Crazy!

312
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,494
I didn't say it...

313
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:46,638
You didn't have to.

314
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,453
No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

315
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:50,602
Yeah, you did.

316
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:52,656
No!

317
00:30:52,815 --> 00:30:54,125
I'm gonna go see my sister.

318
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:56,697
Fine. See your sister.

319
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,044
- Fine.
- No! Wait!

320
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,837
Queenie! No! Queenie!

321
00:31:02,316 --> 00:31:04,305
I didn't mean it.

322
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,631
I didn't say nothing.

323
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:30,357
PARIS

324
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,942
My dear Queenie,
what a beautiful city.

325
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,502
I'm thinking of you, Tina.

326
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,216
Hey, Newt?

327
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:50,417
Down here, Jacob.
I'll be with you in a second.

328
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:56,472
I got my own problems.

329
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:06,561
BUNTY! DON'T FORGET TO
GIVE PATRICK PELLETS.

330
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:23,187
Queenie left a postcard.

331
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:25,459
Tina's in Paris looking for Credence.

332
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,748
Genius!

333
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,421
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

334
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:30,494
Okay, we're going to France, pal!

335
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:31,832
Hold on. I'll get my jacket.

336
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,833
I've got it.

337
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:42,385
Oh. Beautiful.

338
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:47,569
BUNTY, GONE TO PARIS. HAVE
TAKEN NIFFLERS WITH ME. NEWT.

339
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:02,766
Nagini.

340
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,655
Credence.

341
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:14,405
I think I know where she is.

342
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:22,564
We escape tonight.

343
00:34:22,565 --> 00:34:23,565
Hey.

344
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,290
I've told you to stay away from her, boy.

345
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,707
Did I say you could
take a break?

346
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:36,782
Clean out the Kappa.

347
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:40,370
And you, get ready!

348
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,673
Next in our little show of
freaks and oddities...

349
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:00,308
I present to you...

350
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,034
a Maledictus!

351
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:08,761
Once trapped in the jungles of Indonesia,

352
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:12,281
she is the carrier of a
blood curse.

353
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,675
Such Under-beings are destined,
through the course of their lives...

354
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:20,722
to turn permanently into beasts.

355
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:29,006
But look at her. So beautiful, yes?

356
00:35:30,553 --> 00:35:32,664
So desirable.

357
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:37,818
But soon she will be trapped
forever in a very different body.

358
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,421
Every night, when she sleeps...

359
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:43,748
mesdames et messieurs...

360
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,870
She is forced to become...

361
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,886
She is forced to become...

362
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:04,850
She is forced to become...

363
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:18,208
Over time, she will not be
able to transform back.

364
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,390
She will be
forever trapped in the body of a snake.

365
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:58,647
Credence!

366
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:09,208
Pack it up!

367
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:11,576
Paris is done for us now.

368
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:44,240
The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?

369
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,514
He's looking for his mother.

370
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:52,600
All my freaks think they can go home.

371
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,348
Okay, let's go.

372
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:16,841
Look, I think we were both at the circus
for the same reason, monsieur ...?

373
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:19,552
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

374
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:21,949
And you think right.

375
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,608
- What do you want with Credence?
- The same as you.

376
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,134
- Which is?
- To prove who the boy really is.

377
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,353
If the rumors of his identity are
correct, he and

378
00:38:34,436 --> 00:38:36,641
I are distantly related.

379
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,319
I am the last male of my
pure-blooded line.

380
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,190
And so, if the rumors are correct, is he.

381
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:48,653
Have you read The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus?

382
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:52,693
Yeah.
But that's poetry, not proof.

383
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,362
If I could show you something better

384
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:03,511
more concrete, something
that proves who he is

385
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:07,349
would the Ministries of Europe and America
let him live?

386
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:09,283
They might.

387
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:13,012
Then come.

388
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:38,967
So...

389
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:44,377
Credence Barebone.

390
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:50,514
Nearly destroyed by the woman who
raised him.

391
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:53,920
Yet now he seeks the mother who bore him.

392
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,653
He's desperate for family.

393
00:39:57,035 --> 00:39:58,815
He's desperate for love.

394
00:39:59,975 --> 00:40:02,954
He's the key to our victory.

395
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,934
Well, we know where the boy is, don't we?

396
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:10,591
- Why don't we grab him and leave!
- He must come to me freely...

397
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:12,201
and he will.

398
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:17,914
The path has been laid,
and he is following it.

399
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,839
The trail that will lead him to me,

400
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:26,537
and the strange and glorious
truth of who he is.

401
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:28,402
Why is he so important?

402
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,195
Who represents the greatest
threat to our cause?

403
00:40:41,277 --> 00:40:42,527
Albus Dumbledore.

404
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:46,670
If I asked you now to go to the school...
where he is

405
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:51,169
hiding and kill him for me,
would you do it for me, Krall?

406
00:40:57,276 --> 00:41:00,686
Credence is the only entity alive...

407
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:03,102
who can kill him.

408
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:08,017
You really think that he
can kill the great...

409
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:11,892
can kill Albus Dumbledore?

410
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:13,744
I know he can.

411
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:19,021
But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?

412
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:23,705
Will you?

413
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:38,220
Jacob, that man Tina's been seeing...

414
00:41:38,221 --> 00:41:39,819
Don't worry, she's gonna see you.

415
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,628
And she'll see the four of
us together, it'll be just

416
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:43,367
like New York all over again.
Don't worry about it.

417
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:46,488
- Yes, but he's an Auror, Queenie said?
- Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?

418
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:47,563
Don't worry about him.

419
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,791
What do you think I should
say to her, if I see her?

420
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,110
Oh, well, it's best not
to plan these things.

421
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,010
You know, you just say
whatever comes to you in the moment.

422
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:09,277
She has eyes just like a salamander.

423
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:10,911
Don't say that.

424
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:18,027
Nah, look, you just tell
her that you missed her.

425
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:22,515
Right, and then you
came all the way to Paris just to find her.

426
00:42:23,363 --> 00:42:24,571
She'll love that.

427
00:42:24,572 --> 00:42:29,409
And then, tell her you're losing
sleep at night for thinking of her.

428
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,897
Just don't say
anything about no salamanders, all right?

429
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,163
Right. Okay.

430
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:39,278
Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be all right.

431
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,880
We're in this together, pal.

432
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:45,164
Okay, I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna
help you find Tina, find Queenie,

433
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:48,361
and we'll all be happy again.
Just like old times.

434
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:49,386
Who is this guy?

435
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,154
He's the only way I can leave the
country without documentation.

436
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,916
Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?

437
00:42:57,152 --> 00:42:59,528
I don't do well on boats, Newt.

438
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:00,664
You'll be fine.

439
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:03,262
Stir your stumps-it leaves in one minute!

440
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:05,677
Fifty Galleons.

441
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:07,437
No, we said thirty.

442
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:09,319
Thirty to go to France,

443
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,459
twenty not to tell anyone, I seen Newt
Scamander leaving the country illegally.

444
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:17,739
Price of fame, pal.

445
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,284
Ten seconds.

446
00:43:24,994 --> 00:43:25,994
Jacob.

447
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:27,161
Seven.

448
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:29,486
Six

449
00:43:32,386 --> 00:43:33,386
Four.

450
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Three.

451
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,542
Two. One.

452
00:43:48,168 --> 00:43:50,144
I didn't like that Portkey, Newt.

453
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:51,705
So you keep saying.

454
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,063
Follow me.

455
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:01,193
<i>Confundus.</i>

456
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:08,032
Come on. That'll wear off in a few minutes.

457
00:44:20,568 --> 00:44:22,068
<i>Appare vestigium.</i>

458
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:28,652
<i>Accio Niffler...</i>

459
00:44:29,237 --> 00:44:32,133
Get looking. Oi! Get looking.

460
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:37,527
That's a Kappa.

461
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,215
That's a Japanese water demon.

462
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:45,695
Tina?

463
00:44:46,573 --> 00:44:47,573
Tina?!

464
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,565
What have you found?

465
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:01,843
And we're licking the dirt now.
Revelio.

466
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:21,628
Newt... what made those?

467
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,642
That is a Zouwu.

468
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:30,535
It's a Chinese creature. They are
incredibly fast and incredibly powerful.

469
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:32,862
They can travel a thousand miles in a
day

470
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:36,894
and this one could take you from one part
of Paris to the next in a single leap.

471
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:42,152
Oh, good boy.

472
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:46,902
Jacob, she was here.
Tina stood here.

473
00:45:47,304 --> 00:45:49,635
She has incredibly narrow
feet, have you noticed?

474
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:52,950
Can't say that I have.

475
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:58,928
Then someone came towards her.

476
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,652
<i>Avenseguim.</i>

477
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,651
- Follow that feather.
- What?

478
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,612
- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.

479
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:24,318
Where is he? Ah, Accio Niffler.

480
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:32,718
Let go of the bucket!

481
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:12,976
<i>Bienvenue Au Ministère
des Affaires Magiques.</i>

482
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:16,109
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you just said at all.

483
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:20,974
Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic.
What is your business, please?

484
00:47:21,987 --> 00:47:25,677
I need to speak to Tina Goldstein.

485
00:47:25,766 --> 00:47:31,302
She's an American Auror working
on a case here.

486
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:37,997
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

487
00:47:38,212 --> 00:47:41,173
No, it's... I'm sorry there
must be some sort of mistake.

488
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:44,073
See, I know she's in Paris,
she sent me a postcard.

489
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:46,554
I brought it, I can show it to you.
Maybe you

490
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,058
can help me find her here?
It's just in here.

491
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:50,331
Oh rabbits!

492
00:47:50,644 --> 00:47:52,817
If you can just wait one moment!

493
00:47:52,818 --> 00:47:55,954
I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it. Where?

494
00:47:56,568 --> 00:47:57,978
One second.

495
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,096
<i>Please.</i>

496
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,415
Could we at least stop
for a coffee, or like a...

497
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,493
Not now, Jacob.

498
00:48:43,946 --> 00:48:45,770
This way. Come on.

499
00:48:45,771 --> 00:48:49,817
Pain Au chocolat? Half a
croissant, or like, a bonbon?

500
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:50,818
This way.

501
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,067
Jacob!

502
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:12,214
Jacob?

503
00:49:58,610 --> 00:49:59,869
Madame?

504
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,157
Tout Va bien, Madame?

505
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,878
She's home.

506
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,260
Qui est là?

507
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:42,844
C'est votre fils, madame.

508
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:44,116
Qui êtes-vous?

509
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:45,727
Are you Irma?

510
00:51:47,073 --> 00:51:49,264
Are you ...? Are you Irma Dugard?

511
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:55,344
I'm sorry. Your name is
on my adoption paper.

512
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:58,474
Does this make sense?

513
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:03,451
You gave me to Mrs. Barebone in New York.

514
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:23,883
I am not your mother.

515
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:26,346
I was only a servant.

516
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:32,171
You were so beautiful baby.

517
00:52:34,947 --> 00:52:37,173
And you are a beautiful man.

518
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:50,144
I have missed you.

519
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:52,263
Why didn't they want me?

520
00:52:56,816 --> 00:52:59,683
But why is your name on my adoption
paper?

521
00:52:59,993 --> 00:53:02,389
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

522
00:53:03,302 --> 00:53:07,122
because she was supposed to look after
you.

523
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:16,057
She's dead.

524
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:21,288
How did the boy take it?

525
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:23,176
He's sensitive.

526
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:29,283
The Ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I've missed.

527
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,743
- They know my reputation..
- Listen to me...

528
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:36,028
The disapproval of cowards
is praise to the brave.

529
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:41,529
Your name will be written in glory
when wizards rule the world.

530
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:45,128
And the clock is ticking faster.

531
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,421
You watch over Credence.

532
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:49,368
Keep him safe.

533
00:55:50,268 --> 00:55:51,829
For the greater good.

534
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,789
For the greater good.

535
00:55:58,282 --> 00:56:00,658
You know what I miss about Queenie?

536
00:56:02,629 --> 00:56:03,685
Everything.

537
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:09,097
I even miss the
stuff that drove me nuts.

538
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:10,819
Like the mind reading.

539
00:56:16,932 --> 00:56:19,510
I was lucky to have someone like her

540
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:21,802
even interested in anything
I thought.

541
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:24,818
You know what I mean?

542
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,579
Sorry?

543
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:36,260
I was saying, you're sure the guy
is here that we're looking for?

544
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,433
Definitely. The feather says so.

545
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:11,340
- Is that the guy we're looking for?
- Yes.

546
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:18,191
Sire.

547
00:57:18,961 --> 00:57:21,114
Err... bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.

548
00:57:22,328 --> 00:57:23,484
Oh wait, no, sorry!

549
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:27,485
We were just wondering if
you'd come across uh, a friend of ours...

550
00:57:27,796 --> 00:57:29,190
Tina Goldstein.

551
00:57:29,804 --> 00:57:32,052
Monsieur, Paris is a large city.

552
00:57:32,652 --> 00:57:33,652
She's an Auror..

553
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:38,523
When Aurors go missing, the
Ministry tend to come looking. So...

554
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:43,414
No, now I suppose it would probably
be better if we just report her absence.

555
00:57:43,438 --> 00:57:44,438
Is she tall? Dark? Rather

556
00:57:46,439 --> 00:57:47,712
Dark rather...

557
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,204
- intense?
- Beautiful.

558
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,842
Yeah, what I meant to say-

559
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:54,157
she's very-very pretty!

560
00:57:55,078 --> 00:57:58,433
I think I saw someone like this last night.

561
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,920
- Perhaps if I showed you where?
- If you wouldn't mind. That would be...

562
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:06,227
- That would be lovely.
- Sure.

563
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:46,052
Tina?

564
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:49,985
- Newt!
<i>- Expelliarmus!</i>

565
00:58:52,284 --> 00:58:55,718
My apologies, Mr. Scamander!

566
00:58:55,759 --> 00:58:59,718
I shall return and release you once
Credence is dead!

567
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:00,747
Kama, wait!

568
00:59:00,748 --> 00:59:04,426
You see, either he dies... or I do.

569
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:06,887
No, no, no.

570
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:13,137
Oh no. No, no, no.

571
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,985
Well, that's not the best
start to a rescue attempt.

572
00:59:21,986 --> 00:59:23,977
This was a rescue attempt?

573
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,578
You've just lost me my only lead.

574
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:29,467
Well, how was the interrogation
going before we turned up?

575
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:34,318
Newt!

576
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:39,872
Well done, Pick.

577
00:59:42,542 --> 00:59:46,027
- So, you need this man, you say?
- Yeah.

578
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:49,610
I think this man knows where
Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

579
00:59:54,056 --> 00:59:56,061
Well, that'll be the Zouwu.

580
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:17,327
Come on, Newt, get out of there!

581
01:01:43,394 --> 01:01:47,536
What were the three biggest
mistakes that you made last time?

582
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:49,920
Caught by surprise, sir.

583
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:51,599
What else?

584
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,045
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

585
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:55,978
Very good. And the last one...

586
01:01:56,601 --> 01:01:58,906
the most important one?

587
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:09,778
Not learning from the first two.

588
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:13,568
This is a school, you've no right

589
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:18,333
I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement and
I have the right to go wherever I please.

590
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:21,217
Out of here.

591
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:28,019
Go with Professor McGonagall, please.

592
01:02:34,773 --> 01:02:36,279
He's the best teacher we've got.

593
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,565
- Thanks, McClaggan.
- Get out!

594
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:40,118
Come, McClaggan.

595
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,424
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

596
01:02:48,947 --> 01:02:49,813
Really?

597
01:02:49,844 --> 01:02:52,379
Cut the pretense. I know
he's there on your orders.

598
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,287
If you'd ever had the
pleasure to teach him, you'd

599
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:57,876
know Newt is not a great
follower of orders.

600
01:03:00,522 --> 01:03:02,938
You've read The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus??

601
01:03:02,963 --> 01:03:03,990
Many years ago.

602
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:09,219
“A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter"

603
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,357
- Return.
- Yes, I know it.

604
01:03:12,746 --> 01:03:15,824
There's a rumor this prediction
refers to the Obscurial.

605
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:18,314
They say that Grindelwald wants.

606
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:20,924
A highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.

607
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:26,486
And yet Scamander appears wherever
the Obscurial goes, to protect him.

608
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,708
Meanwhile you have built up quite a
little network of international contacts.

609
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:35,603
However long you keep me and my
friends under surveillance...

610
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,902
You're not going to discover
plots against you, Travers.

611
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:42,361
Because we want the same thing:
the defeat of Grindelwald.

612
01:03:45,469 --> 01:03:49,629
But I warn you,
your policies of suppression and violence

613
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,085
are pushing supporters
into his arms.

614
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:54,203
I'm not interested in your warnings!

615
01:03:56,514 --> 01:04:01,381
Now, it pains me to say it, because

616
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:02,883
Well, I don't like you.

617
01:04:05,055 --> 01:04:06,152
But...

618
01:04:08,226 --> 01:04:13,348
you are the only
wizard who is his equal.

619
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,379
I need you to fight him.

620
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:24,311
I cannot.

621
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:29,885
Because of this?

622
01:04:38,485 --> 01:04:41,277
You and Grindelwald were
as close as brothers.

623
01:04:42,538 --> 01:04:44,417
We were closer than brothers.

624
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:57,610
Will you fight him?

625
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,193
I can't.

626
01:05:03,068 --> 01:05:04,818
Then you have chosen your side.

627
01:05:08,152 --> 01:05:11,397
From now on, I shall know
every spell you cast..

628
01:05:11,398 --> 01:05:12,580
I'm doubling the watch on you

629
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:15,765
and you will no longer teach
Defense Against the Dark Arts.

630
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:19,777
Where's Leta? We
need to go to Paris!

631
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:27,058
Theseus.

632
01:05:27,202 --> 01:05:31,415
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally...

633
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:33,259
don't try and break it up.

634
01:05:33,335 --> 01:05:35,632
Don't let Travers send you in there.

635
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:38,784
If you ever trusted me...

636
01:05:38,785 --> 01:05:41,839
Theseus!
Theseus!

637
01:06:23,163 --> 01:06:25,165
Even Lestranges makes me feel sick.

638
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,980
You know she stays here every vacation.

639
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:28,563
Her family don't actually
want her home.

640
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:30,391
I don't blame them,
she's so annoying.

641
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:33,028
- Did you see her last week?
- <i>Oscausi!</i>

642
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:40,657
Professor McGonagall!
Lestrange has done it again!

643
01:06:40,658 --> 01:06:42,742
Lestrange, stop running!

644
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:46,635
- Lestrange! Disobedient children! Stop!
- She needs to come back!

645
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,117
Shame on the House of Slytherin.

646
01:06:48,118 --> 01:06:50,145
A hundred points! Two
hundred!

647
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:52,337
Get back here, right now!

648
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:59,395
Stop! Stop it! Stop it! You stop
it! Get back!

649
01:07:04,745 --> 01:07:07,058
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible!

650
01:07:16,493 --> 01:07:18,872
Scamander... why aren't you packing?

651
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:20,632
I'm not going home.

652
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,289
Why not?

653
01:07:23,226 --> 01:07:24,297
He needs me.

654
01:07:30,652 --> 01:07:32,402
It was hurt.

655
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:40,490
What is that?

656
01:07:41,604 --> 01:07:42,703
A raven chick.

657
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:46,615
Isn't Raven your family emblem.

658
01:07:46,616 --> 01:07:47,802
Yes it is.

659
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:02,607
All right, Newt.

660
01:08:02,608 --> 01:08:04,709
Be brave.

661
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:10,481
That's an unusual one.

662
01:08:10,482 --> 01:08:15,453
So Mrs. Scamander fears what more
than anything else in the world?

663
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:18,204
Having to work in an office, sir.

664
01:08:18,989 --> 01:08:20,365
Go ahead, Newt.

665
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,680
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

666
01:08:24,878 --> 01:08:25,878
Well done.

667
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:28,718
Good job. Leta?

668
01:08:31,492 --> 01:08:32,903
It's only a Boggart,

669
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:34,736
it can't hurt you.

670
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,054
Everyone's scared of something

671
01:08:40,654 --> 01:08:42,494
I've been looking forward to this.

672
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:28,970
I don't want to talk about it!

673
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:48,476
They know me, or they'd hide.

674
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:55,457
They only nest in trees with wand quality
wood,

675
01:09:56,394 --> 01:09:57,617
did you know that?

676
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,246
And they have very complex social lives.

677
01:10:03,773 --> 01:10:06,939
If you watch them for
long enough, you realize.

678
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,059
Hello, Leta.

679
01:10:26,519 --> 01:10:27,780
This is a surprise.

680
01:10:31,735 --> 01:10:32,902
Finding me in a classroom?

681
01:10:34,985 --> 01:10:36,536
Was I such a bad student?

682
01:10:36,537 --> 01:10:38,798
On the contrary, you
were one of my cleverest

683
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:40,499
I said bad, not stupid.

684
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,896
Don't bother answering.

685
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:52,198
- I know you never liked me..
- Well, you're wrong.

686
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:53,876
I never thought you bad.

687
01:10:53,877 --> 01:10:56,628
You were alone, then. Everybody else did.

688
01:10:57,096 --> 01:10:58,112
And they were right.

689
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:00,852
I was wicked.

690
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:05,911
Leta, I know how painful the rumors
about your brother Corvus must

691
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:06,951
be for you.

692
01:11:06,976 --> 01:11:11,402
No, you don't. Not unless you
had a brother who died too.

693
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:13,474
In my case, it was my sister.

694
01:11:16,768 --> 01:11:18,263
Did you love her?

695
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:29,299
Not as well as I
should have done.

696
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:34,902
Never too late to free yourself.

697
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:42,291
Confession is a relief, I'm told.
A great weight lifted.

698
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,708
Regret is my constant companion.

699
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:50,624
Do not let it become yours.

700
01:12:00,957 --> 01:12:03,064
Oh No, thank you.

701
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:07,332
Well, you've been real kind, but...

702
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:12,454
my sister Tina's
probably worried sick about me...

703
01:12:12,455 --> 01:12:14,893
you know, banging on all the doors
and things...

704
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:17,716
so I think I'd better be going.

705
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:19,984
But you haven't met your host.

706
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:21,433
Oh, are you married?

707
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:26,862
Let's say... deeply committed.

708
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:32,300
You see, I can't tell
if you're making a joke

709
01:12:33,765 --> 01:12:35,235
or if you're just...
French.

710
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:47,584
Hey, knock it off.

711
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:56,278
You stay right there.

712
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,081
I know what you are.

713
01:12:59,323 --> 01:13:00,407
Quennie.

714
01:13:02,235 --> 01:13:04,000
We are not here to hurt you.

715
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:06,735
We only want to help you.

716
01:13:08,211 --> 01:13:10,985
You're so very, very far from home.

717
01:13:11,795 --> 01:13:16,170
Far away from everything you
love. Everything that was comfortable.

718
01:13:18,383 --> 01:13:22,296
I would never see you harmed, ever.

719
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,076
It is not your fault that your
sister is an Auror.

720
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:34,300
I wish you were working
with me now towards a

721
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:38,637
world where we wizards
are free to live openly,

722
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,898
and to love freely.

723
01:13:53,519 --> 01:13:55,079
You are an innocent.

724
01:13:57,427 --> 01:13:59,027
So go now.

725
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:02,069
Leave this place.

726
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,159
Hey, Newt, buddy.

727
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:32,253
Tina's up here. She's all by her lonesome

728
01:15:32,254 --> 01:15:34,807
and maybe you want to come
up and keep her company?

729
01:15:36,002 --> 01:15:40,377
I've been looking for food, and
I ain't found any. So, I guess I'm

730
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:44,638
gonna go upstairs and try my
luck in the-I dunno-the attic!

731
01:15:45,623 --> 01:15:48,985
You're all right.
<i>Relaxio.</i>

732
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:55,797
Okay.

733
01:16:08,499 --> 01:16:10,465
She's responded well to the Dittany.

734
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:13,756
She was born to run, you see.

735
01:16:14,262 --> 01:16:17,205
I think she's just lacking in confidence

736
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:22,244
Mr. Scamander, have you got anything in
your case that might help revive this man?

737
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,619
I need to question him.

738
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,296
I think he knows who
Credence really is.

739
01:16:25,321 --> 01:16:27,380
The scars on his hand suggest
an unbreakable vow...

740
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:31,069
- an unbreakable vow.
- Unbreakable vow. I noticed that too.

741
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:42,494
<i>Lumos.</i>

742
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:50,880
What was that?

743
01:16:50,885 --> 01:16:53,207
There must be a water dragon in that sewer

744
01:16:54,809 --> 01:16:57,253
they carry these
parasites, you see. They...

745
01:16:57,949 --> 01:16:59,732
- Jacob?
- Yeah?

746
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:04,597
In my case, in the pocket there,
you'll find a pair of tweezers.

747
01:17:04,622 --> 01:17:05,681
Tweezers?

748
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,450
- They're thin and pointy...
- Thin, little pointy things.

749
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:10,171
Yes, I know what tweezers are.

750
01:17:13,186 --> 01:17:15,124
You might not want to watch this...

751
01:17:15,269 --> 01:17:16,633
I can handle it.

752
01:17:21,664 --> 01:17:23,000
Come on.

753
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:25,312
Come on.

754
01:17:25,998 --> 01:17:27,526
Oh come on.

755
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:31,417
Jacob, will you take that for me?

756
01:17:34,652 --> 01:17:36,498
Calamari..

757
01:17:38,201 --> 01:17:40,390
I must kill him.

758
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:41,757
Who?

759
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,129
Credence?

760
01:17:44,713 --> 01:17:48,765
It may take him a few hours to recover.
The parasite's poison is quite strong.

761
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:52,733
I'll have to go back to the
Ministry with what I've got.

762
01:17:54,778 --> 01:17:56,537
It was nice to see you
again, Mr. Scamander.

763
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,818
Hey, hold on one second, will you?
Well, hold on!

764
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:02,075
Wait! Tina!

765
01:18:06,758 --> 01:18:08,463
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

766
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:11,189
No, she just ran.
I don't know...

767
01:18:12,161 --> 01:18:13,597
So you chase after her!

768
01:18:14,568 --> 01:18:17,153
Tina. Please, just listen to me-

769
01:18:18,281 --> 01:18:21,213
Mr. Scamander, I need to
go talk to the Ministry.

770
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:23,616
And I know how
you feel about Aurors.

771
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:26,661
I may have been a little strong in the way
that I expressed myself in that letters.

772
01:18:26,662 --> 01:18:29,821
What was the exact phrase? “A
bunch of careerist hypocrites”?

773
01:18:29,822 --> 01:18:31,647
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

774
01:18:31,648 --> 01:18:34,789
whose answer to everything that
they fear or misunderstand is “kill it”!

775
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:36,183
I'm an Auror and I don't...

776
01:18:36,184 --> 01:18:38,387
Yes, and that's because
you've gone middle head!

777
01:18:39,645 --> 01:18:40,799
Excuse me?

778
01:18:41,237 --> 01:18:44,077
It's an expression derived from
the three heads of the Runespoor.

779
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:45,411
The middle one is a visionary.

780
01:18:45,412 --> 01:18:50,038
Every Auror in Europe wants Credence
dead-except you. You've gone middle head.

781
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:54,251
Who else uses that
expression, Mr. Scamander?

782
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:56,710
I think it might just be me.

783
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:17,869
It's Grindelwald. He's
calling his followers.

784
01:19:46,068 --> 01:19:47,568
It's too late.

785
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:49,767
Grindelwald's come for Credence.

786
01:19:51,326 --> 01:19:52,655
He might already have him.

787
01:19:52,656 --> 01:19:55,936
It's not too late.
We can still get to him first.

788
01:19:58,177 --> 01:19:59,761
Where are you going?

789
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:01,325
The French Ministry of Magic.

790
01:20:01,354 --> 01:20:03,560
That's the last place Credence would go!

791
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:05,758
There's a box hidden
at the Ministry Tina.

792
01:20:05,783 --> 01:20:08,415
It's a box that can tell
us who Credence really is.

793
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:10,741
A box? What are you talking about?

794
01:20:10,742 --> 01:20:12,442
Trust me.

795
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:18,960
You wanna come out?
Just for a little while?

796
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,931
Credence.

797
01:20:33,735 --> 01:20:38,888
- Shh.
- What do you want?

798
01:20:38,889 --> 01:20:40,631
From you?

799
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:42,445
Nothing.

800
01:20:45,088 --> 01:20:47,143
For you?

801
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,630
Everything I never had.

802
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:54,407
But what is it you want, my boy?

803
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,763
I want to know who I am.

804
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:12,235
This is where you will find
proof of your true identity.

805
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,868
Come to Père Lachaise tonight and
you will discover the truth.

806
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:41,550
Father... why did you make me ...?

807
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,509
Wait!

808
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:47,360
Wait!

809
01:22:09,027 --> 01:22:11,794
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

810
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,622
Are you a ghost?

811
01:22:15,623 --> 01:22:19,462
No, no, I am alive,

812
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,622
but I am an alchemist,
and therefore immortal.

813
01:22:25,428 --> 01:22:28,110
You don't look a day
over three-seventy-five.

814
01:22:30,963 --> 01:22:32,800
Hey, sorry we didn't knock.

815
01:22:32,801 --> 01:22:34,436
No, no matter.

816
01:22:34,437 --> 01:22:36,996
Albus told me some
friends might be dropping in.

817
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:39,327
Nicolas Flamel.

818
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:44,361
- Jacob Kowalski.
- Oh.

819
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,902
- I'm Sorry.
- It's alright.

820
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,240
I didn't.

821
01:22:50,241 --> 01:22:52,241
Ah!

822
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:05,571
At last, we see some developments!

823
01:23:05,572 --> 01:23:07,872
I've seen one of these before.

824
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:09,879
It was at the fair.

825
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,133
There was this dame there, and she
had a veil.. I gave her a nickel and

826
01:23:13,134 --> 01:23:15,577
she told me about my future.

827
01:23:15,578 --> 01:23:18,856
And she missed out on quite a bit actually.

828
01:23:24,763 --> 01:23:27,083
Wait a minute! I know him. That's that kid.
That's Credence

829
01:23:30,315 --> 01:23:31,484
Jesus.

830
01:23:35,547 --> 01:23:37,255
Hey! That's Queenie! There she is

831
01:23:37,256 --> 01:23:38,480
Hi, baby!

832
01:23:38,481 --> 01:23:41,032
Where is this? Is this-is this here?

833
01:23:41,033 --> 01:23:43,275
Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.

834
01:23:43,276 --> 01:23:45,776
It lies in the cemetery of Père
Lachaise

835
01:23:47,348 --> 01:23:49,267
I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.

836
01:23:49,268 --> 01:23:51,309
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Flamel!

837
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,769
- Ahh!
- Ooh no. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay?

838
01:23:53,794 --> 01:23:55,814
Oh-look after
Mr. Tentacles for me.

839
01:23:56,696 --> 01:24:00,946
- Oh no. I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- Please, you must not go to the cemetery!

840
01:24:17,936 --> 01:24:19,633
Oh dear

841
01:24:23,854 --> 01:24:27,254
- What's happening?
- Exactly what he said would happen.

842
01:24:27,741 --> 01:24:31,945
Grindelwald rallies at the cemetery
tonight, and there will be death!

843
01:24:31,946 --> 01:24:33,521
- Then you gotta go!
- What?

844
01:24:33,522 --> 01:24:35,876
I haven't seen action
in two hundred years...

845
01:24:35,977 --> 01:24:38,728
Flamel, you can do this. We believe in you.

846
01:24:47,678 --> 01:24:50,243
The box is in the ancestral
records room, Tina.

847
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:51,667
So, three floors down.

848
01:24:51,668 --> 01:24:53,327
Is that Polyjuice?

849
01:24:53,328 --> 01:24:55,669
Just enough to get me inside.

850
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:05,468
- Who...?
- That's my brother, Theseus.

851
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:07,001
He's an Auror.

852
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,002
And a hugger.

853
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,708
What's happening?

854
01:25:11,849 --> 01:25:15,631
Grindelwald's rallying. We don't know
where, but we think it's tonight.

855
01:25:19,902 --> 01:25:21,567
- Be careful.
- Of course.

856
01:25:21,568 --> 01:25:24,319
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course, I'm going to be careful.

857
01:25:24,782 --> 01:25:26,866
Listen, I want you to hear this
from me.

858
01:25:26,867 --> 01:25:29,222
They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.

859
01:25:29,223 --> 01:25:31,800
- My brother is dead. He died..
- I know. I know.

860
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:32,947
How many times, Theseus?

861
01:25:32,972 --> 01:25:35,382
And the records, the
records will prove that,

862
01:25:35,383 --> 01:25:36,588
okay?

863
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,445
- They can't lie.
- Theseus.

864
01:25:44,456 --> 01:25:47,672
I want every person at
that rally arrested...

865
01:25:47,673 --> 01:25:49,473
- If they resist...
- Sir-forgive me but if we go in too heavy,

866
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:51,904
- don't we run the risk of adding to the.
- Just do it.

867
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:11,475
I don't suppose you can Disapparate on
Ministry premises in France, can you?

868
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:12,576
No.

869
01:26:13,964 --> 01:26:14,964
Pity.

870
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,871
- Newt.
- Yes, I know. I know there's-

871
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,512
<i>Emergency! Emergency! A
tracked wizard, Newt</i>

872
01:26:20,537 --> 01:26:23,327
<i>Scamander, has entered
the Department of Magic!</i>

873
01:26:23,328 --> 01:26:24,828
Newt!

874
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:26,729
Newt!

875
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:28,050
That's your brother?

876
01:26:28,051 --> 01:26:29,656
Yes, I think I may have
mentioned in my letters

877
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,226
that we have quite a
complicated relationship.

878
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:32,115
Newt, stop!

879
01:26:32,116 --> 01:26:35,156
- Does he want to kill you?
- Frequently.

880
01:26:42,115 --> 01:26:44,093
He needs to control his temper!

881
01:26:49,443 --> 01:26:51,906
I think that might have been
the best moment of my life.

882
01:27:36,693 --> 01:27:37,719
Quennie?

883
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:44,445
Queenie, honey?

884
01:27:46,789 --> 01:27:47,941
Don't.

885
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:49,959
Don't move.

886
01:27:57,912 --> 01:27:59,573
Puis-je vous aider?

887
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,574
Yes, this is Leta Lestrange.

888
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,965
And-I'm her...

889
01:28:07,966 --> 01:28:09,353
Fiancé.

890
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:13,765
In you go.

891
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:15,729
Thank you.

892
01:28:28,016 --> 01:28:30,099
Tina, about that fiancée business...

893
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,438
Sorry, yeah. I should
have congratulated you.

894
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:34,367
- No, that's...
- Lumos.

895
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:38,081
Lestrange.

896
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:46,824
Tina, about Leta...

897
01:28:46,825 --> 01:28:48,589
Yes, I've just said, I am happy for you.

898
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,977
Yeah, well, I don't.
Please don't be happy.

899
01:28:53,837 --> 01:28:55,661
Uh, no, no. I'm sorry. I don't...

900
01:28:56,214 --> 01:28:59,391
Uh, obviously, I obviously I
want you to be.

901
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:02,545
And I hear that you are now.

902
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,546
Uh, which is
wonderful. Sorry.

903
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:08,791
What I'm trying to say is,

904
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:12,793
I don't want you to be happy
that I am happy because I'm not...

905
01:29:14,797 --> 01:29:16,433
happy.

906
01:29:16,867 --> 01:29:18,293
Or engaged.

907
01:29:20,096 --> 01:29:22,286
- What?
- It was a mistake in a stupid magazine.

908
01:29:22,287 --> 01:29:26,244
My brother's marrying Leta,
June the sixth... I'm supposed

909
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:29,622
to be best man Which is
sort of mildly hilarious.

910
01:29:29,758 --> 01:29:33,349
Does he think you're here to win her back?

911
01:29:34,492 --> 01:29:38,805
- Are you here to win her back?
- No, I'm here to...

912
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:44,070
you know, your eyes really are.

913
01:29:47,168 --> 01:29:48,268
Are what?

914
01:29:49,616 --> 01:29:51,207
I'm not supposed to say.

915
01:29:54,865 --> 01:29:56,857
Newt, I read your
book, and did you...

916
01:29:56,882 --> 01:29:59,640
I still have a picture
of you-wait, did you read?

917
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,543
I got this...

918
01:30:05,544 --> 01:30:08,520
I mean, it's just a picture
of you from the paper.

919
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:12,078
It's interesting because
your eyes in newsprint...

920
01:30:13,954 --> 01:30:16,795
See, in reality they
have this effect in them, Tina,

921
01:30:16,796 --> 01:30:20,933
it's like fire in water, in dark water..

922
01:30:23,994 --> 01:30:26,307
I've only ever seen that.

923
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,972
I've only ever seen that in...

924
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,134
Salamanders?

925
01:30:41,357 --> 01:30:42,694
Come.

926
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:49,510
Lestrange.

927
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:38,017
Records moved to Lestrange
family tomb at Père Lachaise.

928
01:31:52,691 --> 01:31:54,177
Circumrota.

929
01:32:05,117 --> 01:32:06,203
Hello, Newt.

930
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:11,986
Hello, Leta

931
01:32:16,234 --> 01:32:17,234
Hi.

932
01:32:20,558 --> 01:32:21,605
Oh no.

933
01:32:26,884 --> 01:32:28,599
What kind of cats are those?

934
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,612
These aren't cats.

935
01:32:29,613 --> 01:32:32,084
They're Matagots.
They're spirit familiars.

936
01:32:32,085 --> 01:32:33,909
They guard the Ministry.

937
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,700
- But they won't hurt you...

938
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:39,641
- unless you attack them.
- Stupefy!

939
01:32:41,562 --> 01:32:43,818
- Leta!
<i>- Reverte!</i>

940
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:10,860
<i>Accio!</i>

941
01:33:22,652 --> 01:33:24,152
<i>Ascendio!</i>

942
01:34:16,586 --> 01:34:19,122
Okay. Wait.

943
01:34:20,856 --> 01:34:21,872
Come on.

944
01:34:24,734 --> 01:34:26,813
All right. All right.

945
01:34:29,418 --> 01:34:30,577
Wait.

946
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,274
Move back!

947
01:34:46,275 --> 01:34:47,875
Move! Out of the way!

948
01:34:49,801 --> 01:34:53,239
If you are looking for Credence, me too.

949
01:34:53,403 --> 01:34:54,496
Stop!

950
01:34:58,797 --> 01:34:59,923
Yusuf?

951
01:35:01,147 --> 01:35:02,424
Is that really you?

952
01:35:08,971 --> 01:35:10,363
My little sister .?

953
01:35:13,153 --> 01:35:14,871
So, he's your brother?

954
01:35:16,858 --> 01:35:18,181
Who am I?

955
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:20,516
I don't know.

956
01:35:20,517 --> 01:35:23,767
I'm tired of living with
no name and no history.

957
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:28,841
Just tell me my
story-then you can end it.

958
01:35:28,942 --> 01:35:30,739
Your story is our story.

959
01:35:34,383 --> 01:35:35,901
Our story.

960
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:37,568
No, Yusuf.

961
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:56,385
My father was Mustafa Kama.

962
01:35:56,933 --> 01:36:00,763
A pure-blood of Sénégalese descent
and most accomplished.

963
01:36:01,655 --> 01:36:04,558
My mother, Laurena,

964
01:36:04,953 --> 01:36:08,029
was equally high-bred-a noted beauty.

965
01:36:08,936 --> 01:36:10,963
They were deeply in love.

966
01:36:12,537 --> 01:36:17,676
They knew a man of great influence, from a
famous French pure-blood family.

967
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:20,923
He desired her.

968
01:36:24,794 --> 01:36:29,362
Lestrange used the Imperius
Curse to seduce and abduct her.

969
01:36:30,588 --> 01:36:33,439
I tried to prevent it but he attacked me.

970
01:36:34,895 --> 01:36:37,240
That was the last time I ever saw her.

971
01:36:39,568 --> 01:36:43,134
She died, giving birth to a
little girl.

972
01:36:44,204 --> 01:36:45,471
You.

973
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:52,897
The news of her death
drove my father insane.

974
01:36:53,953 --> 01:37:00,143
With his dying breath, my father
charged me to seek revenge.

975
01:37:02,305 --> 01:37:05,903
Kill the person Lestrange
loves best in the world.

976
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,963
I thought at
first it would be easy.

977
01:37:08,737 --> 01:37:10,815
He had only one close relative

978
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,860
You.

979
01:37:13,277 --> 01:37:13,854
But...

980
01:37:13,926 --> 01:37:14,934
Say it.

981
01:37:16,777 --> 01:37:18,877
He never loved you.

982
01:37:22,757 --> 01:37:26,820
He remarried not three
months after her death.

983
01:37:29,277 --> 01:37:31,973
He loved her no
more than he had loved you

984
01:37:35,826 --> 01:37:37,072
But then...

985
01:37:37,073 --> 01:37:40,002
his son, Corvus, was born at last.

986
01:37:40,557 --> 01:37:43,594
And that man who had never
known...

987
01:37:43,647 --> 01:37:45,492
love was filled with it.

988
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:49,578
All he cared about was little Corvus.

989
01:37:53,064 --> 01:37:54,779
So... this is the truth?

990
01:37:56,151 --> 01:37:58,088
I am Corvus Lestrange?

991
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:00,088
- Yes.
- No.

992
01:38:00,529 --> 01:38:03,871
Realizing that Mustafa Kama's
son had sworn revenge,

993
01:38:03,872 --> 01:38:07,014
your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.

994
01:38:07,477 --> 01:38:12,154
So he confided you to his servant,
who boarded a ship for America.

995
01:38:12,155 --> 01:38:15,531
- He did send Corvus to America, but...
- His servant, Irma Dugard,

996
01:38:15,532 --> 01:38:17,125
was a half-elf...

997
01:38:17,126 --> 01:38:18,801
Her magic was weak and

998
01:38:18,802 --> 01:38:21,740
therefore left no trace I could follow,

999
01:38:22,842 --> 01:38:26,309
I had only just discovered
how you had escaped

1000
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:29,260
when I received news I never expected.

1001
01:38:29,261 --> 01:38:32,189
The ship had gone down at sea.

1002
01:38:32,525 --> 01:38:34,150
But you survived, didn't you?

1003
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:38,504
Somehow, someone had
pulled you from the water!

1004
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:42,154
A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter.

1005
01:38:42,155 --> 01:38:45,402
Return, great avenger
with wings from the water.

1006
01:38:45,403 --> 01:38:47,890
There, stands the despairing daughter.

1007
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:51,832
You are the winged raven returned
from the sea, but I

1008
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:55,808
I am the avenger of my family's ruin.

1009
01:38:58,413 --> 01:38:59,568
I pity you, Corvus,

1010
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:02,693
but you must die.

1011
01:39:03,038 --> 01:39:06,093
Corvus Lestrange is already dead.
I killed him.

1012
01:39:13,193 --> 01:39:14,193
Accio.

1013
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:34,811
My father owned a very strange family tree.

1014
01:39:38,297 --> 01:39:40,435
It only recorded the men...

1015
01:39:44,427 --> 01:39:47,267
The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.

1016
01:39:50,116 --> 01:39:51,199
Beautiful.

1017
01:39:53,675 --> 01:39:54,747
Separate.

1018
01:39:57,357 --> 01:39:59,797
My father sent me to
America, along Corvus..

1019
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:09,298
Irma was to pose as a grandmother
with two grandchildren...

1020
01:40:14,233 --> 01:40:17,273
Corvus never stopped crying.

1021
01:40:35,277 --> 01:40:36,903
I never wanted to hurt him.

1022
01:40:42,654 --> 01:40:44,860
I only wanted to be free of him

1023
01:40:45,111 --> 01:40:47,110
Just for a moment.

1024
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,110
Just a single moment.

1025
01:41:04,443 --> 01:41:05,943
They want us to put on life jackets!

1026
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:07,477
You didn't mean to do it, Leta.

1027
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,000
So it wasn't your fault.

1028
01:42:14,152 --> 01:42:15,258
Oh, Newt.

1029
01:42:19,526 --> 01:42:22,555
You never met a monster you couldn't love.

1030
01:42:26,984 --> 01:42:31,006
Leta, do you know who Credence really is?

1031
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:35,327
Did you know, when
you swapped him?

1032
01:42:35,328 --> 01:42:36,707
No.

1033
01:42:59,343 --> 01:43:01,823
Queenie?

1034
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,613
They're pure-bloods.

1035
01:43:29,312 --> 01:43:31,477
They kill the likes of us for sport!

1036
01:43:34,375 --> 01:43:35,995
- Quennie.
- Jacob.

1037
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:38,751
Honey, you're here! Hi!

1038
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,940
Hi, dear, do not.

1039
01:43:40,762 --> 01:43:43,017
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry,

1040
01:43:43,019 --> 01:43:45,272
I never should have done it, I love you so
much.

1041
01:43:45,273 --> 01:43:47,610
- And you know that I love you, right?
- Yeah.

1042
01:43:47,611 --> 01:43:51,110
- Good, now let's get the hell out of here.
- Oh, wait. Wait a second.

1043
01:43:53,610 --> 01:43:56,552
I just thought maybe we could hear him
first.

1044
01:43:56,553 --> 01:43:59,274
You know, just listen, that's all.

1045
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:01,641
What are you talking about?

1046
01:44:06,777 --> 01:44:08,143
It's a trap.

1047
01:44:08,493 --> 01:44:09,545
Yeah.

1048
01:44:10,738 --> 01:44:14,797
Queenie-the family
tree-it's all been bait.

1049
01:44:15,873 --> 01:44:18,186
We have to find a way
out of here, right now

1050
01:44:19,473 --> 01:44:21,094
You go find the others.

1051
01:44:21,235 --> 01:44:22,335
What are you gonna do?

1052
01:44:22,996 --> 01:44:24,079
I'll think of something.

1053
01:45:12,917 --> 01:45:18,547
My brothers, my sisters, my friends:

1054
01:45:20,004 --> 01:45:23,955
the great gift of your applause
is not for me...

1055
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:26,654
No. It is for yourselves.

1056
01:45:29,436 --> 01:45:31,832
You came today
because of a craving

1057
01:45:33,153 --> 01:45:34,902
and a knowledge

1058
01:45:36,652 --> 01:45:40,092
that the old
ways serve us no longer.

1059
01:45:42,865 --> 01:45:46,975
You come today because you crave
something new.

1060
01:45:48,568 --> 01:45:50,318
Something different.

1061
01:45:52,594 --> 01:45:58,586
It is said that I hate Les Non-Magiques,

1062
01:45:58,587 --> 01:46:00,125
The Muggle.

1063
01:46:00,209 --> 01:46:01,560
The No-Maj.

1064
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:04,361
The Can't-Spells.

1065
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,358
I do not hate them. I do not.

1066
01:46:12,568 --> 01:46:14,352
For I do not fight out of hatred.

1067
01:46:17,064 --> 01:46:22,985
I say the Muggles are not lesser, but
other.

1068
01:46:23,735 --> 01:46:27,987
Not worthless,
but of other value.

1069
01:46:29,902 --> 01:46:32,620
Not disposable,

1070
01:46:32,621 --> 01:46:35,004
but of a different disposition.

1071
01:46:35,152 --> 01:46:38,536
Magic blooms

1072
01:46:38,537 --> 01:46:42,099
only in rare souls.

1073
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:53,127
Oh, and what a world we could
make, for all of humanity...

1074
01:46:53,128 --> 01:46:56,957
We who live for freedom,

1075
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:58,393
for truth.

1076
01:47:00,369 --> 01:47:02,322
And for love.

1077
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:14,103
It isn't illegal to listen to him!

1078
01:47:15,049 --> 01:47:17,327
Use minimum of force on the crowd.

1079
01:47:18,657 --> 01:47:20,549
We mustn't be what he says we are!

1080
01:47:26,533 --> 01:47:31,031
The moment has come to share
my vision of the future.

1081
01:47:32,731 --> 01:47:35,969
That awaits if we do not rise up

1082
01:47:37,915 --> 01:47:42,452
and take our rightful place in the world.

1083
01:48:26,743 --> 01:48:28,606
Not another war.

1084
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:37,779
That is what we are fighting!

1085
01:48:38,847 --> 01:48:40,499
That is the enemy.

1086
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,742
Their arrogance.

1087
01:48:44,898 --> 01:48:46,739
Their power lust.

1088
01:48:48,951 --> 01:48:50,614
Their barbarity.

1089
01:48:52,236 --> 01:48:56,427
How long will it take before they
turn their weapons on us?

1090
01:48:58,426 --> 01:49:01,234
Do nothing when I speak of this.

1091
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,638
You must remain calm

1092
01:49:05,959 --> 01:49:07,817
and contain your emotions.

1093
01:49:12,143 --> 01:49:14,372
There are Aurors here among us.

1094
01:49:24,447 --> 01:49:27,336
Come closer, brother wizards! Join us.

1095
01:49:28,598 --> 01:49:29,942
Do nothing.

1096
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:32,609
No force.

1097
01:49:48,382 --> 01:49:51,414
They have killed many of my followers.

1098
01:49:51,824 --> 01:49:53,336
It is true.

1099
01:49:54,902 --> 01:49:59,070
They confined me
tortured me in New York.

1100
01:50:00,499 --> 01:50:05,482
They had struck down their fellow
witches and wizards...

1101
01:50:06,278 --> 01:50:11,650
For the simple crime of seeking the truth.

1102
01:50:12,666 --> 01:50:14,202
For wanting freedom...

1103
01:50:19,104 --> 01:50:22,748
Your anger, your desire
for revenge is natural.

1104
01:50:26,363 --> 01:50:29,603
No!

1105
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:02,318
Take this young warrior back to her family.

1106
01:51:09,902 --> 01:51:13,766
Disapparate. Leave.
Go forth from

1107
01:51:13,791 --> 01:51:17,402
this place and spread the word.

1108
01:51:18,485 --> 01:51:21,830
It is not we who are violent.

1109
01:52:10,226 --> 01:52:14,195
Aurors, join me in this circle.

1110
01:52:15,764 --> 01:52:20,133
Pledge to me your eternal allegiance.

1111
01:52:20,668 --> 01:52:22,031
Or die.

1112
01:52:22,329 --> 01:52:24,814
Only here shall you know freedom.

1113
01:52:24,815 --> 01:52:27,870
Only here shall you know
yourself.

1114
01:52:35,122 --> 01:52:36,730
Play by the rules.

1115
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:38,788
No cheating, children.

1116
01:52:44,336 --> 01:52:46,046
He knows who I am.

1117
01:52:46,274 --> 01:52:50,001
He knows what you were
born, not who you are...

1118
01:52:50,002 --> 01:52:52,002
Credence!

1119
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:08,345
Queenie. You gotta wake up!

1120
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:13,263
Jacob, he's the answer.

1121
01:53:13,689 --> 01:53:15,981
- He wants what we wants.
- No, no, no.

1122
01:53:15,982 --> 01:53:16,982
Why?

1123
01:53:26,275 --> 01:53:28,607
This has all been for you, Credence.

1124
01:53:32,154 --> 01:53:33,340
Walk with me.

1125
01:53:35,443 --> 01:53:36,942
Honey, no!

1126
01:53:36,943 --> 01:53:38,771
Walk with me!

1127
01:53:40,715 --> 01:53:42,124
You're crazy.

1128
01:53:46,104 --> 01:53:47,109
Not!

1129
01:53:47,110 --> 01:53:49,830
No! Queenie, don't do it!

1130
01:54:01,027 --> 01:54:02,485
Queenie!

1131
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:20,921
Mr. Scamander.

1132
01:54:20,981 --> 01:54:24,949
Do you think Dumbledore will mourn for you?

1133
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:37,879
Grindelwald! Stop!

1134
01:54:45,366 --> 01:54:46,466
Leta...

1135
01:54:56,725 --> 01:54:58,805
This one I believe I know.

1136
01:54:59,969 --> 01:55:01,705
Leta Lestrange.

1137
01:55:02,985 --> 01:55:05,657
Despised entirely amongst wizards.

1138
01:55:05,658 --> 01:55:08,945
Unloved, mistreated...

1139
01:55:10,037 --> 01:55:11,530
yet brave.

1140
01:55:12,673 --> 01:55:14,583
So very brave.

1141
01:55:19,275 --> 01:55:20,906
Time to come home.

1142
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:40,316
I love you.

1143
01:55:49,383 --> 01:55:50,401
Go!

1144
01:55:51,727 --> 01:55:52,731
Go!

1145
01:56:16,379 --> 01:56:17,951
I hate Paris.

1146
01:56:57,794 --> 01:57:01,295
Together! In a circle,
your wand into the earth.

1147
01:57:01,565 --> 01:57:03,979
Or all Paris will be lost!

1148
01:57:11,068 --> 01:57:12,168
<i>Finite!</i>

1149
01:57:14,149 --> 01:57:15,292
<i>Finite!</i>

1150
01:57:15,293 --> 01:57:16,660
<i>Finite!</i>

1151
01:57:18,062 --> 01:57:19,092
<i>Finite!</i>

1152
01:59:28,985 --> 01:59:30,545
I've chosen my side.

1153
01:59:51,463 --> 01:59:57,343
Oh come here. I've got you.
I've got you.

1154
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:43,959
I think it's best if he
speaks to him alone.

1155
02:01:18,027 --> 02:01:21,073
Is he frightened of me still?

1156
02:01:21,074 --> 02:01:22,346
You need to be careful ..

1157
02:01:23,704 --> 02:01:26,024
He's not sure he made the right choice.

1158
02:01:27,264 --> 02:01:30,784
Be very gentle with him.

1159
02:01:35,985 --> 02:01:38,485
I have a gift for you, my boy.

1160
02:01:50,392 --> 02:01:54,212
Is it true about Leta?

1161
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,357
Yes.

1162
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,943
I'm so sorry.

1163
02:02:07,693 --> 02:02:09,765
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

1164
02:02:12,476 --> 02:02:14,787
You swore not to fight each other.

1165
02:02:22,467 --> 02:02:24,760
How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get?

1166
02:02:29,218 --> 02:02:33,441
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand the
nature of things he considers simple...

1167
02:02:49,617 --> 02:02:50,846
Can you destroy it?

1168
02:02:51,047 --> 02:02:52,109
Maybe.

1169
02:02:54,383 --> 02:02:55,412
Maybe.

1170
02:03:01,605 --> 02:03:03,373
Would he like a cup of tea?

1171
02:03:04,733 --> 02:03:06,351
He'll have some milk.

1172
02:03:08,641 --> 02:03:10,605
Hide the teaspoons.

1173
02:03:16,345 --> 02:03:21,258
You have suffered the most
heinous of betrayals,

1174
02:03:21,259 --> 02:03:25,474
most purposely bestowed
upon you by your

1175
02:03:25,499 --> 02:03:29,243
own blood. Your own
flesh and blood.

1176
02:03:29,244 --> 02:03:32,092
And just as he has celebrated your torment,

1177
02:03:34,563 --> 02:03:38,259
your brother seeks to
destroy you.

1178
02:03:59,207 --> 02:04:03,244
There is a legend in your family that
a phoenix will come to any member

1179
02:04:03,245 --> 02:04:04,943
who is in dire need.

1180
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:14,472
It is your birthright, my boy.

1181
02:04:19,064 --> 02:04:21,203
As is

1182
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:24,334
the name I now restore to you.

1183
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:28,275
Aurelius.

1184
02:04:29,941 --> 02:04:32,795
Aurelius Dumbledore.

1185
02:04:34,473 --> 02:04:38,715
We will go down in history together
as we remake this world.
