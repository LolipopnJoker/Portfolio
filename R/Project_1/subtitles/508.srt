1
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:23,756
Our man's in position
on the center camera.

2
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:25,930
It's like a terrorist supermarket.

3
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:30,363
Chinese Long March Scud,
Panther AS-565 attack helicopter...

4
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,560
...a pair of Russian mortars, and
the crates look like American rifles.

5
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:38,397
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.

6
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,709
IDs.

7
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,344
White Rook to White Knight.
Show us the pawns.

8
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:47,140
You see, he did get through, admiral.
Start with that chap in the middle.

9
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,407
Load the ID program, please.

10
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,414
Database ID search.

11
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,416
Checking the databases.

12
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:56,454
We've got our first match.
Satoshi Isagura.

13
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:59,147
Chemical expert.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.

14
00:01:59,392 --> 00:02:02,725
Currently working for
the insurgent force in Zaire.

15
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,420
Henry Gupta. American.

16
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:09,260
Practically invented
techno-terrorism.

17
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:12,164
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.

18
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:14,166
Now he sells his politics for cash.

19
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:17,636
- Zoom in on that, can you?
- That looks like an American encoder.

20
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:20,969
They use it to control navigation
satellites: The GPS system.

21
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:24,814
Will the CIA be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it?

22
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,778
Excuse me. Admiral?

23
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:32,614
Thank you, M, we've seen enough.
This is now a military operation.

24
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,516
You saw the Gatling gun?

25
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:37,020
Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?

26
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:40,354
We have election
in Moscow next week.

27
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,464
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

28
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,962
We'll take the naval option.

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,192
In one strike, we take out
half the world's terrorists.

30
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,801
- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
- Get me the <i>Chester,

31
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,405
- Let's not waste time.
- My man isn't finished.

32
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:58,906
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.

33
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:02,541
Get your man out of there.
His job is over.

34
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:05,945
<i>Weapons authorized,</i>
<i>Prepare to fire,

35
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:12,777
On my count.
Five, four, three, two, one.

36
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:14,217
Missile away.

37
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:19,953
Time to target:
Four minutes, eight seconds.

38
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,794
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.

39
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,562
Yes, damn it, I know what it is.
It's on the screen in front of me.

40
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:31,362
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

41
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:33,472
Now, get the hell out of there!

42
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:36,164
- What the hell's going on?
- You will not wait!

43
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,935
- That's an order!
- What is your man waiting for?

44
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:41,977
White Knight? Oh, my God!

45
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,445
Those are Soviet SB-5
nuclear torpedoes.

46
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,583
- lf the cruise hits them...
- Order them to abort the missile.

47
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,687
- <i>H, M, S, Chester,</i> urgent.
- White Knight, come in.

48
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,950
Abort missile. Abort missile.

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,094
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.

50
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,964
Captain, sir, missile out of range.

51
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,758
<i>Unable to destroy,

52
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:13,767
- White Knight...
- Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

53
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,475
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.

54
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:19,668
But even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium...

55
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:22,279
...to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.

56
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,575
Bloody hell. Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

57
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:28,343
Evacuate your troops,
and get him out of there, now.

58
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:31,613
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in.

59
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,225
- Keep trying, damn it.
- White Knight, come in.

60
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:40,525
Repeat, White Knight, come in.

61
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,005
Filthy habit.

62
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,017
I've got the encoder.

63
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,626
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.

64
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,164
He's going for the bombs.

65
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:45,979
Get that jeep!

66
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:57,623
Get out of it, James.

67
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,719
One minute to impact.

68
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,500
Thirty seconds to impact.

69
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:17,997
Back-seat driver.

70
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,835
White Knight to White Rook.

71
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,164
<i>I've evacuated the area,

72
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,036
<i>Ask the admiral where</i>

73
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,772
Sound the general alarm.

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:55,714
<i>The ship has been overflown</i>
<i>by two Chinese MiGs,

75

<i>Hands to action stations,

00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:18,864

00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:22,838
Aye, aye, sir.
Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.

79
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,532
Are they insane?

80
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:31,709
The Chinese pilot insists that
we are only 11 miles off their coast...

81
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,248
...and he will fire if we don't
turn around and go to a Chinese port.

82
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:38,047
Send this:
"We are in international waters...

83
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,052
...and will defend ourselves
if attacked.

84
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,951
Copy all this

85
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,695
Are we absolutely sure
of our position?

86
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,865
Yes, sir. An exact satellite fix.

87
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:26,226
Captain, we are ready to launch.

88
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,364
Shut down the engines.

89
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,191
Maintain full silence.

90
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:34,097
A stealth ship may be invisible
to radar but the sea drill isn't.

91
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:41,535
We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by...

92
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,734
...and the British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.

93
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,936
I should report in.

94
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:55,282
<i>Stamper to Hamburg,</i>

00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:08,163
- The MiGs are making another pass.
- Let's start the show.

97
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,161
Sea drill in position.

98
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:23,774
Start the drill.

99
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,482
- Release it.
- Sea drill away.

100
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:43,022
Green 3-0,
torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.

101
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:45,095
Green 3-0, center bearing 1-1-4.

102
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:47,424
Officer of the Watch,
come hard right, 1-4-1.

103
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:50,123
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

104
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:56,298
Bearing steady. It's gonna hit, sir.

105
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,337
Brace, brace, brace.

106
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:08,806
- Target: 1200.
- Knock, knock.

107
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:27,498
Let's go upstairs.

108
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,234
- Turn left.
- Rotating 90 degrees.

109
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,850
Now they're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.

110
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,218
PWO, captain.
Full damage report.

111
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:05,863
Backup power, immediately!

112
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,830
Switch to alternate supply.

113
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:13,436
Three generators are down, sir.
Flooding on four deck aft.

114
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,540
Sir, we're now down
14 degrees by the stern.

115
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,107
Yeoman, send to Admiralty:

00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:21,006
"Have been torpedoed by
Chinese MiGs. Sinking."

117
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:25,347
Give them our position.
Right. Abandon ship.

118
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,940
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

119
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:35,684
Everyone on deck! Come on!

120
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,564
One missile at the MiGs.

121
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,279
Maintaining radio silence.

122
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,455
Their last broadcast, sir.

123
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,987
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.

124
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:20,286
They gave their final position
70 miles from here.

125
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,726
The British Navy
will never find them.

126
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,132
Survivors in the water.

127
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,615
Mr. Stamper,
I'm having fun with my headlines.

128
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:49,514
I need to know
the exact number of survivors.

129
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:53,417
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.

130
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,091
<i>Yes, sir,

00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,813
Start the recovery operation.

133
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,115

143
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:38,044
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

144
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:41,443
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill
lowering the cable rates...

145
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,550
...we'll release a video of him

It seems a small crisis is brewing

I want full newspaper coverage.
I want magazine stories.

I want books. I want films.
I want TV. I want radio.

165

How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?

172
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:53,495
Just ignore it.

173
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,722
Those are words they just
don't have in their vocabulary.

174
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:03,528
- Bond here.
- <i>Go to a secure line, 007,

175
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:07,138
Going to scrambler, channel four.

176
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:10,575
That's ridiculous.
That ship was in international waters.

177
00:23:10,743 --> 00:23:15,008
- We can't be certain.
- James? Where are you?

178
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:17,045
Oh, Moneypenny.

179
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:23,017
I'm just up here at Oxford
brushing up on a little Danish.

180
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:24,415
Little?

181
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:26,682
<i>I'm afraid you're gonna have to</i>
<i>kiss off your lesson,

182
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:29,347
We've got a situation here
at the Ministry of Defense.

183
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:31,460
We're sending the fleet to China.

184
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:36,520
I'll be there in an hour.

185
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:38,222
Make that 30 minutes.

186
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:45,732
You always were
a cunning linguist, James.

187
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:50,972
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

188
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:06,913
That's preposterous. We know exactly
where that ship was positioned.

189
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:10,356
The GPS system... Global
Positioning Satellites do not lie.

190
00:24:10,527 --> 00:24:14,258
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal...

191
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:16,796
...on the GPS frequency
at the time of the attack.

192
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,558
It could've sent that ship
off course.

193
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:21,601
- I have a missing British frigate...
- I'm aware of that!

194
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,068
And instead of decisive action,
all you wanna do is investigate.

195
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,469
My goal is to prevent World War III,
admiral, and I don't think...

196
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:29,611
...sending an armada into the recovery
area is the best way to do it.

197
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:32,940
Where, exactly, did this mysterious
GPS signal come from?

198
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,945
- We're still investigating.
- "Investigating."

199
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,710
M, sometimes I don't think
you have the balls for this job.

200
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:42,111
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

201
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,381
...I don't have to think
with them all the time.

202
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:48,153
That's enough.
Now, where do we stand?

203
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:53,388
It was an unprovoked attack
on a ship in international waters.

204
00:24:53,564 --> 00:24:57,055
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.

205
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,497
Moderation. We investigate...

206
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,797
...and stop short of sending
the entire British Navy...

207
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:04,098
...within 10 minutes
of the world's largest air force.

208
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:07,242
- When will our ships be in position?
- Forty-eight hours.

209
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,411
Christ!

210
00:25:09,578 --> 00:25:11,442
The press are already
screaming for blood.

211
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,480
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.

212
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:17,674
I'm afraid it may be too late
to worry about that.

213
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,445
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

214
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:26,085
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies...

215
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,857
...the victims were riddled
with the same ammunition...

216
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:31,427
...used by the Chinese Air Force.
- Did you leak this?

217
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,859
No.

218
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,667
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.

219
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:41,104
We send in the fleet.

220
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:44,570
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

221
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:54,782
There is one strange thing.

222
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:57,451
When I called our contact
in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

223
00:25:57,619 --> 00:25:59,609
...only found our sailors
three hours ago.

224
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:01,482
How'd they get the paper out
so fast?

225
00:26:01,956 --> 00:26:05,187
Somebody at <i>Tomorrow</i> knew before
the Vietnamese government did.

226
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:09,022
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?

227
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:10,527
Worldwide media baron.

228
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:13,324
Able to topple governments
with a single broadcast.

229
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,133
Carver owns
that newspaper <i>Tomorrow,

230
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,398
I didn't want to discuss it
in front of the minister...

231
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:21,470
...but that mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

232
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:26,532
The PM would have my head
if he knew you were investigating him.

233
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,577
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007.
We've arranged for your invitation...

234
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:31,738
...to a party
at Carver's Media center.

235
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:34,308
They're celebrating the launch
of a new satellite...

236
00:26:34,484 --> 00:26:37,976
...because now he has the ability
to reach every human on the Earth.

237
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:41,212
Except the Chinese,
who have refused broadcast rights.

238
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:47,254
James, your ticket, cover story
and rental car reservation.

239
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:49,020
Sign here, please.

240
00:26:49,563 --> 00:26:52,862
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

241
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:56,063
That was a long time ago, M...

242
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:58,169
...before she was married.

243
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,538
I didn't realize
it was public knowledge.

244
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,073
Queen and country, James.

245
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:07,610
Your job is to find out whether Carver
or someone in his organization...

246
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,770
...sent that ship off course
and why.

247
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:12,879
Use your relationship
with Mrs. Carver if necessary.

248
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:15,210
I doubt if she'll remember me.

249
00:27:15,452 --> 00:27:17,181
Remind her.

250
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:20,754
Then pump her for information.

251
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:25,226
You'll just have to decide
how much pumping is needed, James.

252
00:27:26,362 --> 00:27:28,659
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.

253
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:09,256
If you'll just sign here, Mr. Bond.

254
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:15,931
It's the insurance damage waiver...

255
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:18,970
...for your beautiful new car.

256
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:22,664
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.

257
00:28:22,843 --> 00:28:24,208
Fire?

258
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,478
Probably.

259
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:29,272
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.

260
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:31,006
Personal injury?

261
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,445
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

262
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:35,642
They frequently do with you.

263
00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:41,286
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.

264
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:42,948
Do I need any other protection?

265
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:48,231
Only from me, 007, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order.

266
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:50,622
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

267
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:56,633
Your new BMW 750.

268
00:28:56,838 --> 00:29:00,274
All the usual refinements.
Machine guns, rockets...

269
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:02,807
...the GPS tracking system.

270
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:08,278
<i>Welcome, Please fasten seat belt and</i>
<i>obey all instructions for a safe trip,

271
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:11,178
I thought you'd pay more attention
to a female voice.

272
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:14,449
- I think we've met.
- I am not interested...

273
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,518
...in your sordid escapades.

274
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,553
Let's get on with it, shall we?

275
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,486
Your new telephone.

276
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,322
Talk here, listen here.

277
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,888
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.

278
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,997
It also includes
a fingerprint scanner...

279
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,999
...and a 20,000-volt
security system.

280
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:37,036
And this I'm particularly proud of:

281
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:40,034
The remote control for your car.

282
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,801
Tap twice.

283
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:43,535
One, two.

284
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:47,309
Now, draw your finger...

285
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:49,983
...very slowly across the pad...

286
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,046
...to drive the car.

287
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,426
It's surprisingly difficult to drive,
but with practice...

288
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:05,027
Well, let's see how she responds
to my touch, eh, Q?

289
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,549
I think we understand each other.

290
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:34,186
Grow up, 007.

291
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:54,102
<i>Attention, Engine running,</i>
<i>Please shut door now,

292
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:10,916
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumor...

293
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,553
...that I started running
Mad Cow Disease stories...

294
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:17,452
...simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron...

295
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:21,219
...lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.

296
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,988
Moreover, there's even
less truth in the rumor...

297
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:27,064
...that I took 100 million francs
from the French...

298
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,394
...to keep the stories running
for another year.

299
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:32,164
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver.
- Yes.

300
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:35,134
This is the new banker, Mr?

301
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:38,140
Bond. James Bond.

302
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,273
Another new banker.
I seem to collect them.

303
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:44,474
Tell me, Mr. Bond...

304
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:47,081
...how's the market reacting
to the crisis?

305
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:50,252
Well, currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

306
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:53,588
I don't believe we have met.

307
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,651
- Elliot Carver.
- Wai Lin.

308
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:58,952
I'm from the
New China News Agency.

309
00:31:59,161 --> 00:32:01,151
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.

310
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:02,819
I have a confession.

311
00:32:03,498 --> 00:32:06,296
It's not. I snuck in.

312
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:08,894
Why would you do that, my dear?

313
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:10,933
I wanted to meet you.

314
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:12,795
Outstanding.

315
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,873
I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.

316
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,907
You should work in
my Beijing bureau.

317
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:19,442
Mr. Carver.

318
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:23,314
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing.
- Call me Elliot.

319
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:37,781
I always wondered how I'd feel
if I ever saw you again.

320
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,126
Now I know.

321
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:51,837
Was it something I said?

322
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:55,133
How about the words
"I'll be right back"?

323
00:32:57,577 --> 00:33:00,944
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.

324
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:05,014
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.

325
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,844
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

326
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,977
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini,
shaken not stirred.

327
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,352
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila,
straight shot.

328
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,489
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.

329
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:22,888
I see you've moved up
in the world, Paris.

330
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:26,501
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

331
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:30,561
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

332
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:45,607
- To you.
- No, to the gun.

333
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:54,387
So I take it this isn't a social visit?

334
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,492
Your husband may be in trouble.

335
00:33:56,694 --> 00:33:58,924
The emperor of the air.

336
00:33:59,096 --> 00:34:01,564
If you think you're going after him,
you're the one who's in trouble.

337
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:05,428
Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.

338
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:08,799
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

339
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,734
No. That wasn't my plan.

340
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:14,205
Good. Because if it
comes to a choice...

341
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:16,640
...between you and Elliot,
I've made my bed.

342
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:19,143
You don't sleep in it anymore.

343
00:34:19,313 --> 00:34:20,712
There you are.

344
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:24,706
Darling.

345
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,282
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

346
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:32,748
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

347
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,590
- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.

348
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:38,122
And this is James Bond.

349
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:40,795
I didn't realize you knew each other.

350
00:34:41,032 --> 00:34:43,262
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.

351
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,663
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

352
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:50,567
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin
behind a news desk.

353
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:53,071
That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist...

354
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,735
...too much.

355
00:34:57,613 --> 00:35:00,080
Tell me, Elliot, I was just
wondering about your satellites...

356
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,580
...the way you've positioned
yourself globally.

357
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:05,685
They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.

358
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,353
Or disinformation.

359
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:11,815
Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments or people.

360
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:13,850
Or even a ship.

361
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:18,796
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

362
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:22,558
You have a vivid imagination
for a banker.

363
00:35:22,768 --> 00:35:25,099
Perhaps I should commission you
to write a novel.

364
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:29,103
Oh, heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

365
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:32,937
Mr. Carver?

366
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:39,808
It's time to begin the festivities.

367
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:41,347
Excuse me. Darling?

368
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:48,482
So how do you really know him?

369
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:51,489
I told you, he's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

370
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,956
You're a terrible liar, dear.

371
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,860
I have a problem with a banker.

372
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,023
Could I see you a moment?

373
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:05,635
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,699
Mr. Carver's broadcast will begin
in 10 minutes in the main studio.

375
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:18,246
Exactly what kind of banking
do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

376
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:23,318
Hostile takeovers. Shall we?

377
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:36,194
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

378
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:38,696
It's nice to talk to the world.

379
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,067
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

380
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:49,238
Mr. Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.

381
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,015
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five...

382
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,650
...four, three, two...

383
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,650
Good evening.

384
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,415
Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to be a celebration...

385
00:37:08,658 --> 00:37:12,253
...marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.

386
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:14,894
But, as you're well aware...

387
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:18,055
...a terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea...

388
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:19,791
...which, unchecked...

389
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:25,597
...has the potential to destroy
every human being on Earth.

390
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:29,263
- <i>I want to assure my viewers that I,,,</i>
- This way, please.

391
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:32,740
<i>,,, Elliot Carver, have spoken</i>
<i>with the prime minister in London,,,

392
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:34,742
<i>,,, and the chairman in Beijing,,,

393
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:37,438
<i>,,, and have offered my services</i>
<i>as an impartial...

394
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:43,945
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.

395
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:52,217
<i>Herr</i> Stamper,
we have made contact.

396
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,829
Make him uncomfortable.

397
00:37:54,998 --> 00:37:57,192
I'll be there in a few moments.

398
00:37:57,399 --> 00:38:00,630
- with its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day...

399
00:38:01,337 --> 00:38:03,930
...and its satellite facilities
linking every last...

400
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:11,067
You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.

401
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:15,576
He wants to know why.

402
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:18,249
<i>Why did I do it, you ask,

403
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:21,318
<i>The answer is simple: power,

404
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:25,245
<i>The power to illuminate</i>
<i>the far corners of the globe,

405
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:27,220
<i>Not for higher profits,,,

406
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:31,758
...but for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

407
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:34,590
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play
a little number on his head.

408
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:44,365
<i>And what do I expect in return?

409
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:47,131
Worldwide domination.

410
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:51,368
<i>Complete, utter, total</i>
<i>worldwide domination,

411
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,672
<i>But not over governments or ideology,

412
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:59,318
<i>Over tyranny and isolation</i>
<i>and ignorance,

413
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,488
<i>The Carver Media Group Network</i>
<i>has the ability,,,

414
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:07,648
<i>,,, to reach every person</i>
<i>in every village in every nation,

415
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,760
<i>But do not fear me,,,

416
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:12,361
<i>,,, for tonight I offer you</i>
<i>my declaration of principles:

417
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,697
<i>A promise to the men and women</i>
<i>of this planet,,,

418
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,202
<i>,,, my brothers and sisters</i>
<i>whom I so humbly serve,

419
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:24,465
<i>I promise to report the news</i>
<i>without fear or favor,

420
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:28,040
<i>I promise to be a force</i>
<i>for good in this world,

421
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:31,712
<i>Fighting injustice,</i>
<i>crushing intolerance,,,

422
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:33,039
<i>,,, battling inhumanity,

423
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:37,149
- <i>Striking a blow for freedom,</i>
- It's time for...

424
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:40,086
...a station break.

425
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,489
- What's happening?
- We've lost power.

426
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:47,716
- We're off the air.
- What?!

427
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:58,666
Ladies and gentlemen, stay calm.
There's no need to go for the exit.

428
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:01,066
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

429
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:04,706
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're fired! Get out of my sight!

430
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,605
<i>And, in a rather embarrassing note,,,

431
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,377
<i>,,, scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver</i>
<i>was cut off the air tonight,,,

432
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,952
<i>,,, in mid-speech during</i>
<i>the inaugural broadcast,,,

433
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:02,852
<i>,,, of his Worldwide Satellite Network,

434
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:05,549
<i>Sorry, Elliot,</i>
<i>but we didn't do it,

435
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:10,229
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

436
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:12,558
Come on, Elliot.
Ignore those people.

437
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:15,290
- Sometimes these things happen.
- Not to me.

438
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:17,726
Not to me!

439
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:31,310
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

440
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:36,815
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.

441
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:40,445
The key to a great story
is not who...

442
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,091
...or what or when...

443
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,927
...but why.

444
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:51,428
Your friend, Mr. Bond,
made a mess tonight.

445
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:56,592
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.

446
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,106
Barely?

447
00:42:27,497 --> 00:42:30,693
I was curious
who Carver would send.

448
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:33,325
He's on to you.

449
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:37,863
Well, we know where you stand.

450
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:40,704
You made your bed.

451
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:44,977
I'm standing in your doorway.

452
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:50,345
Then turn around and go home.

453
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:54,578
You can tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

454
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:00,389
That's it? Go home?

455
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:04,755
I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.

456
00:43:04,995 --> 00:43:07,225
It's too late for that.

457
00:43:15,705 --> 00:43:17,535
Why did you marry him?

458
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,535
He told me he loved me.

459
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:23,069
That always sounds good.

460
00:43:24,545 --> 00:43:28,413
Do you know I used to look in
the papers for your obituary?

461
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,416
Well, I'm sorry
I keep disappointing you.

462
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:40,752
What was it, James?

463
00:43:44,395 --> 00:43:46,761
Did I get too close?

464
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:53,903
Did I get too close for comfort?

465
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:07,646
Yes.

466
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,323
I missed you.

467
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,424
What did you find?

468
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:08,463
I hacked into the mainframe
at the bank.

469
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:11,067
They're using
an SSL2 encryption, 128...

470
00:45:11,236 --> 00:45:14,261
Spare me the technobabble, please.

471
00:45:14,438 --> 00:45:16,929
Bond's got a perfect
employment record. Ten years.

472
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:19,473
He's crossed every T,
he's dotted every I.

473
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:21,667
- Which means?
- Government agent.

474
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,745
I call it
Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.

475
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:28,109
If it sounds too good to be true,
it always is.

476
00:45:29,384 --> 00:45:31,443
Do you think my wife knows?

477
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:38,117
There's a lot of garbage, but
if you dial down the ambient noise...

478
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:43,528
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep</i>
<i>with a gun under your pillow?

479
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,959
Play it again.

480
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:51,466
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep</i>
<i>with a gun under your pillow?

481
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:56,998
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.

482
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:08,144
<i>Tell me, James, do you still sleep</i>
<i>with a gun under your pillow?

483
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:18,152
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

484
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,850
I can get you out of the country
in four hours.

485
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,427
I have no choice.

486
00:46:22,629 --> 00:46:25,928
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

487
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:29,829
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.

488
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:31,936
I can't do that.

489
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,339
He has a secret lab on the top floor
even I'm not supposed to know about.

490
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,341
There's an emergency hatch
on the roof.

491
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:42,638
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.

492
00:46:42,846 --> 00:46:44,643
Don't argue with me, James.

493
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:48,583
You know...

494
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:51,987
...this job of yours...

495
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,689
...it's murder on relationships.

496
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,462
Until I get back next week,
I want two guards...

497
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:23,292
...outside this office
24 hours a day.

498
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,466
Nobody gets in. Got it?

499
00:48:25,634 --> 00:48:27,431
We'll take care of it.

500
00:48:30,606 --> 00:48:32,664
What do we do with the satellite?

501
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:37,573
Send this thing to the launch site.
And be careful.

502
00:48:37,778 --> 00:48:41,839
It's worth $300 million. You break it,
you bought it. Understand?

503
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:44,549
I hate traveling.
I never know what to pack.

504
00:50:24,403 --> 00:50:26,371
Looking for a news story?

505
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:38,374
They'll print anything these days.

506
00:53:41,404 --> 00:53:42,735
Yes?

507
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:46,738
<i>Good morning, Mr, Bond,</i>
<i>Elliot Carver,

508
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:50,105
<i>I believe you've got</i>
<i>two items that belong to me,

509
00:53:50,345 --> 00:53:52,209
What are you talking about?

510
00:53:52,413 --> 00:53:55,246
<i>The red box, Mr, Bond,,,

511
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:58,384
<i>,,, and my wife in your hotel room,

512
00:54:10,762 --> 00:54:12,524
He's coming.

513
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:19,868
<i>Fingerprint ID accepted,

514
00:54:27,443 --> 00:54:29,411
<i>Please select security system level,

515
00:54:53,298 --> 00:54:54,925
Tell me if you find the encoder.

516
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:57,567
- <i>Call me immediately,</i>
- <i>Yeah,

517
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:12,504
<i>And in breaking news,,,

518
00:55:12,748 --> 00:55:17,480
<i>,,, it is with great sadness that we</i>
<i>announce the death of Paris Carver,,,

519
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:20,620
<i>,,, who has become an international</i>
<i>figure since she became the wife,,,

520
00:55:20,788 --> 00:55:23,951
<i>,,, of Elliot Carver,</i>
<i>chairman of this network,

521
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:26,957
<i>According to police officials</i>
<i>in Hamburg, Germany,,,

522
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:29,594
<i>,,, Mrs, Carver was found dead</i>
<i>this morning,,,

523
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:33,493
<i>,,, in a hotel suite in that city</i>
<i>in unusual circumstances,,,

524
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,163
<i>,,, on which police</i>
<i>have refused to elaborate,

525
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:39,195
<i>A coroner has been called for</i>
<i>and is expected to deliver,,,

526
00:55:39,404 --> 00:55:42,668
<i>,,, his full report within</i>
<i>the next three days,

527
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:46,468
<i>Her body was discovered along with</i>
<i>the body of an unidentified man,,,

528
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,702
<i>,,, who appeared to be the victim</i>
<i>of a self-inflicted gun wound,

529
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,074
<i>Reached aboard his private jet</i>
<i>en route...

530
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,182
I have a clear shot at your head,
Mr. Bond.

531
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:58,953
Stand up, slowly.

532
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,748
Drop your gun and
kick it toward me, <i>ja?

533
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,885
<i>At present, police</i>
<i>have refused to speculate,,,

534
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:06,617
<i>,,, on a motive in this</i>
<i>murder-suicide,

535
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:08,555
Good. Now...

536
00:56:08,762 --> 00:56:11,287
...lie down on the bed
next to Mrs. Carver.

537
00:56:11,631 --> 00:56:15,191
<i>We extend our deepest sympathies</i>
<i>to Mr, Carver,

538
00:56:17,536 --> 00:56:19,868
This story will be
on the news in an hour.

539
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:24,064
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.

540
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:33,209
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

541
00:56:33,717 --> 00:56:36,651
I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.

542
00:56:36,886 --> 00:56:38,911
Take my word for it, <i>ja?

543
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:45,992
Get the sledgehammers.

544
00:56:58,738 --> 00:57:01,104
She struggled terribly, Mr. Bond.

545
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:04,599
It's a pity you got her
involved in all this.

546
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:10,005
It won't look like a suicide
if you shoot me from over there.

547
00:57:10,214 --> 00:57:12,774
I am a professor
of forensic medicine.

548
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:15,451
Believe me, Mr. Bond,
I could shoot you from Stuttgart...

549
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,087
...and still create the proper effect.

550
00:57:26,262 --> 00:57:29,163
My art is in great demand,
Mr. Bond.

551
00:57:29,331 --> 00:57:31,161
I go all over the world.

552
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,729
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.

553
00:57:36,271 --> 00:57:40,570
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond,
that our little...

554
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:45,467
Stamper! Stop yelling in my ear, <i>ja?

555
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:48,044
Sir, they can't get into the car.

556
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:50,604
You can't be serious.

557
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:54,351
- Did you call the Auto Club?
- <i>Do you wanna call them?

558
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:56,417
<i>Make him tell you how to open it,

559
00:57:56,588 --> 00:57:58,452
Okay, I ask.

560
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:02,291
This is very embarrassing.

561
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:04,585
It seems there is
a red box in your car.

562
00:58:04,794 --> 00:58:06,523
They can't get to it.

563
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:10,564
They want me
to make you unlock the car.

564
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:13,428
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.

565
00:58:15,669 --> 00:58:18,296
I am to torture you
if you don't do it.

566
00:58:18,505 --> 00:58:21,633
- You have a doctorate in that too?
- No, no, no.

567
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:25,537
This is more like a hobby.
But I'm very gifted.

568
00:58:26,245 --> 00:58:28,042
Oh, I believe you.

569
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:30,846
- My cell phone opens the car.
- No, Mr. Bond.

570
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,939
I do it, <i>ja?

571
00:58:37,655 --> 00:58:40,282
Recall, three, send.

572
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:52,624
Wait.

573
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,564
I'm just a professional doing a job.

574
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:57,961
Me too.

575
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:28,221
Dr. Kaufman.

576
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:01,856
<i>Welcome, Please fasten seat belt,

577
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:11,433
<i>Reduce speed,</i>
<i>Pedestrians in roadway,

578
01:01:17,324 --> 01:01:18,416
<i>Driver alert,

579
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,822
<i>Obstruction ahead,</i>
<i>Reduce speed now,

580
01:02:42,397 --> 01:02:45,854
<i>Reminder:</i>
<i>Unsafe driving will void warranty,

581
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:33,433
<i>Congratulations on a safe journey,

582
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:00,787
Yo! Jimbo!

583
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:02,898
Wade, what are you doing here?

584
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:05,931
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.

585
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:07,966
Did Q bring you up to speed?

586
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,968
Yeah. I brought along
the GPS calibration unit.

587
01:04:11,173 --> 01:04:15,836
By the way, officially Uncle Sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot.

588
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:17,339
And unofficially?

589
01:04:17,578 --> 01:04:20,569
We have no interest in seeing
World War III, unless we start it.

590
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:24,239
Dr. Greenwalt.
He's the Air Force GPS expert.

591
01:04:24,418 --> 01:04:25,975
Sorry about all this security...

592
01:04:26,185 --> 01:04:29,313
...but the GPS encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets...

593
01:04:29,488 --> 01:04:30,819
...in the U.S. military.

594
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,753
Show him what you got.

595
01:04:36,995 --> 01:04:39,986
Jesus, it's the missing encoder.
How the hell did you get that?

596
01:04:40,197 --> 01:04:42,665
Picked it up in Hamburg
yesterday morning.

597
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:46,098
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off course?

598
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:47,769
- Like the <i>Devonshire?</i>
- Whoa!

599
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:50,269
I didn't hear anybody mention
the <i>Devonshire,</i> Did you?

600
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,931
- No.
- Good. So just answer his question.

601
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:56,600
Well, in theory, if you could alter
the timing chip...

602
01:04:56,812 --> 01:04:59,144
...you could slowly
send a ship off course.

603
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:01,281
Like putting a magnet
near a compass.

604
01:05:01,449 --> 01:05:02,677
Yeah, exactly.

605
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:05,478
- Then check this out.
- Oh, yeah.

606
01:05:17,529 --> 01:05:20,362
Those two circles should be
lining up on top of each other.

607
01:05:20,532 --> 01:05:23,125
Somebody's tampered
with your encoder.

608
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:28,165
If we knew the last time and position
the <i>Devonshire</i> thought she was...

609
01:05:28,372 --> 01:05:31,000
...could you figure out
exactly where she sank?

610
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,539
Sure.

611
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:35,139
- Wade?
- Yeah?

612
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:38,302
I have a small favor to ask.

613
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:47,819
The high-altitude,
low-opening jump, the HALO jump...

614
01:05:48,022 --> 01:05:51,048
...is where we get the most fatalities,
so listen up.

615
01:05:51,258 --> 01:05:55,421
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your
oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

616
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,151
Sounds like my first marriage.

617
01:05:57,864 --> 01:05:59,229
Next, after the free-fall...

618
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:01,992
...pop the chute at 200 feet,
below the Chinese radar.

619
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,998
You'll be traveling
at over 200 miles an hour.

620
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,000
This snaps your head back
like a cantaloupe.

621
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:08,638
Don't crack your skull open
on the tanks.

622
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,272
I'll keep that in mind.

623
01:06:10,441 --> 01:06:13,899
One last thing: When you hit the water,
don't forget to cut away your chute.

624
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:16,375
Ninety percent of people
killed in HALO jumps...

625
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:20,038
...got tangled up in their chutes
and drowned. Got it?

626
01:06:20,216 --> 01:06:22,342
Seems like a lot
just to save the world.

627
01:06:22,518 --> 01:06:23,917
I've got no choice.

628
01:06:24,153 --> 01:06:27,088
I have to prove that ship
was deliberately sent off course.

629
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:29,387
- One minute!
- Is the pickup set?

630
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:31,957
You bet. After your mission,
turn on your beacon.

631
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,560
The extraction team
will pick you up after dark.

632
01:06:36,863 --> 01:06:38,296
Buddha bless!

633
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:41,226
- I just noticed something.
- Yeah?

634
01:06:41,968 --> 01:06:43,958
This is where the ship
thought it was.

635
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,037
This is where it really is.
But see that island?

636
01:06:47,206 --> 01:06:49,867
- Yeah.
- That means where he's jumping...

637
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:52,100
...between the British
and Chinese fleets...

638
01:06:52,277 --> 01:06:55,041
Technically they're not
in Chinese territorial waters.

639
01:06:55,213 --> 01:06:57,680
- They belong to Vietnam.
- Vietnam?

640
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,907
Does he have any
U.S. government markings on him?

641
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:03,176
The parachute,
the wet suit, the fins.

642
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:06,412
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.

643
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:13,884
He didn't even say goodbye.

644
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,518
Still interested in hostile takeovers?

645
01:11:36,452 --> 01:11:39,717
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.

646
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:01,307
Get them out of the water.

647
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,156
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
were following me around, Mr. Bond.

648
01:12:20,357 --> 01:12:22,154
You'll have to admit, though...

649
01:12:22,325 --> 01:12:25,350
...we seem to have developed
a certain attachment to each other.

650
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:28,519
Hopefully not for long.

651
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,895
Another Carver building.

652
01:12:35,103 --> 01:12:38,663
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.

653
01:12:58,789 --> 01:13:00,188
General Chang?

654
01:13:00,357 --> 01:13:02,086
Friend of yours?

655
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:07,193
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

656
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:10,597
Welcome to Saigon.

657
01:13:10,767 --> 01:13:12,563
It's always nice to see you, Elliot.

658
01:13:13,568 --> 01:13:16,196
I hadn't intended opening
this center until tomorrow...

659
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:20,101
...but as you're here you can help me
write the inaugural story:

660
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:21,798
Your obituaries.

661
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:24,704
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.

662
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:30,912
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary...

663
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:32,812
...when you asked her to betray me.

664
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:35,952
Still, let's see.

665
01:13:36,522 --> 01:13:39,217
"British secret service agent
James Bond...

666
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,290
...and his collaborator Wai Lin...

667
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:44,390
...of the Chinese People's
External Security Force...

668
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:46,718
...were found...

669
01:13:46,897 --> 01:13:49,058
...dead this morning...

670
01:13:49,266 --> 01:13:51,461
...in Vietnam.

671
01:13:53,803 --> 01:13:55,828
Lacks punch, don't you think?

672
01:13:56,172 --> 01:13:57,969
It's old news, Elliot.

673
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,936
We've been working together
for months.

674
01:14:00,108 --> 01:14:02,941
Both our governments know what you
and General Chang are up to.

675
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:06,810
I don't think so.

676
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,141
You may have seen the general
in the hallway just now...

677
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:11,409
...but perhaps,
with all your jetting around...

678
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:14,576
...you've not had chance to peruse
today's headlines.

679
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:23,559
I rather like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

680
01:14:23,762 --> 01:14:25,696
I never believe what I read
in the press anyway.

681
01:14:26,664 --> 01:14:28,928
Therein lies your problem, Mr. Bond.

682
01:14:29,133 --> 01:14:33,433
You see, we're both men of action,
but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.

683
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:37,128
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.

684
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:41,208
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?

685
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:42,774
Exactly!

686
01:14:42,945 --> 01:14:45,641
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies...

687
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,782
...I have my divisions.
TV, news, magazines.

688
01:14:50,852 --> 01:14:53,945
And by midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people...

689
01:14:54,154 --> 01:14:57,681
...than anyone in the history
of this planet, save God Himself.

690
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,457
And the best he ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.

691
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,026
You really are quite insane.

692
01:15:04,697 --> 01:15:07,359
The distance
between insanity and genius...

693
01:15:07,599 --> 01:15:09,328
...is measured only by success.

694
01:15:10,101 --> 01:15:11,466
Excuse me.

695
01:15:11,636 --> 01:15:15,127
- General Chang is waiting.
- lf you'll forgive me...

696
01:15:15,405 --> 01:15:18,863
Your appearance here has forced me
to move up my timetable slightly.

697
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:22,875
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

698
01:15:23,045 --> 01:15:24,376
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

699
01:15:25,648 --> 01:15:28,411
- Sir. The helicopter.
- Thanks, Gupta.

700
01:15:28,617 --> 01:15:31,518
Mr. Stamper is a protg
of the late Dr. Kaufman...

701
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:35,211
...who was schooling him in
the ancient art of chakra torture.

702
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:37,748
He was like a father to me.

703
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,984
Really? Interesting role model.

704
01:15:41,195 --> 01:15:44,163
According to Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points.

705
01:15:44,564 --> 01:15:47,431
Energy centers,
like the heart or genitals.

706
01:15:47,667 --> 01:15:50,863
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs...

707
01:15:51,069 --> 01:15:53,162
...inflicting the maximum amount
of pain...

708
01:15:53,539 --> 01:15:56,371
...whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.

709
01:15:56,574 --> 01:15:58,940
Dr. Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.

710
01:16:00,144 --> 01:16:01,839
I'm hoping to break it.

711
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:05,575
I would've thought watching
your TV shows was torture enough.

712
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:08,414
Save this one till last.

713
01:16:09,585 --> 01:16:11,553
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

714
01:16:11,754 --> 01:16:15,781
...there should just be enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.

715
01:16:16,024 --> 01:16:17,286
Excuse me.

716
01:16:46,383 --> 01:16:47,816
Go! Go! Go! Go!

717
01:16:55,325 --> 01:16:57,383
We can use the banner.

718
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:01,887
Hope it holds.

719
01:17:03,631 --> 01:17:06,498
- Get after them!
- Ready? Go!

720
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:33,218
Next time I'll take the elevator.

721
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,991
Push! Push!

722
01:18:00,246 --> 01:18:01,543
- Get a car!
- No, no!

723
01:18:01,748 --> 01:18:04,740
- Yes, a car!
- A bike is quicker.

724
01:18:05,384 --> 01:18:07,284
The keys.
Someone always forgets them.

725
01:18:07,452 --> 01:18:09,977
What are you doing?
I'm driving. Get off.

726
01:18:11,657 --> 01:18:13,055
Get on the back.

727
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,552
I'm slipping.

728
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,521
Stop fidgeting back there.

729
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:26,296
What are you...?

730
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:27,867
Give me that.

731
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,970
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

732
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,662
- Turn right.
- No, left.

733
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,670
Who's driving? Come on!

734
01:19:06,069 --> 01:19:07,092
Clutch!

735
01:19:13,342 --> 01:19:14,706
Left! Left!

736
01:19:17,946 --> 01:19:19,436
How many back there?

737
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:21,511
I can't see. Hold on.

738
01:19:24,418 --> 01:19:25,942
What are you...? What?

739
01:19:28,387 --> 01:19:31,515
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.

740
01:19:33,593 --> 01:19:35,116
One. No, two.

741
01:19:41,398 --> 01:19:42,831
- Go for the barrels.
- What?

742
01:19:46,237 --> 01:19:47,636
Very good.

743
01:20:08,289 --> 01:20:09,619
Hold on!

744
01:20:17,363 --> 01:20:19,456
Let's take the highway.

745
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:42,243
- Helicopter!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

746
01:21:29,224 --> 01:21:32,215
- Get on the back of the bike.
- Are you trying to protect me?

747
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,792
No. I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.

748
01:21:43,837 --> 01:21:45,235
- You ready?
- Yeah.

749
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:46,802
Go!

750
01:22:00,050 --> 01:22:01,574
Pop the clutch.

751
01:22:31,745 --> 01:22:34,269
- It's behind us.
- Move!

752
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:38,277
Get out of the way!

753
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,308
You see the chopper?

754
01:23:12,579 --> 01:23:15,012
I can't see. Hold on.

755
01:23:19,785 --> 01:23:20,945
What are you...?

756
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:36,056
Trapped.

757
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:39,394
Never.

758
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,443
Would you pass the soap?

759
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:34,780
Over there.

760
01:24:38,018 --> 01:24:40,509
You were pretty good
with that hook.

761
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:43,814
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.

762
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,155
You were pretty good
on the bike.

763
01:24:46,326 --> 01:24:50,159
Well, that comes from
not growing up at all.

764
01:24:50,362 --> 01:24:52,193
Here. Allow me.

765
01:24:54,233 --> 01:24:56,132
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

766
01:24:56,334 --> 01:24:59,235
Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.

767
01:25:01,105 --> 01:25:02,401
Work hand in hand?

768
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,870
Stick closer to each other.

769
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:08,634
Maybe we go after
General Chang together.

770
01:25:10,145 --> 01:25:11,669
Your turn.

771
01:25:11,881 --> 01:25:13,678
Thanks for washing my hair.

772
01:25:15,117 --> 01:25:17,016
I work alone.

773
01:27:48,047 --> 01:27:49,639
Lucky for you I stopped by.

774
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,683
I could've taken care of him.

775
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,482
But you didn't.
Give me the earring.

776
01:28:00,391 --> 01:28:05,260
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue, Chinese army.

777
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:07,552
Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.

778
01:28:07,797 --> 01:28:09,822
You still think
you can do this alone?

779
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,368
It depends whether your mission
is peace or revenge.

780
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,866
This is about stopping a war.

781
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:23,976
Last year we found
stealth material was missing...

782
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:26,305
...from one of
General Chang's bases.

783
01:28:26,514 --> 01:28:28,845
I followed a lead
to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.

784
01:28:29,049 --> 01:28:30,516
Stealth material?

785
01:28:30,717 --> 01:28:32,514
We thought he was building
a stealth plane.

786
01:28:34,086 --> 01:28:36,714
No. Stealth boat.

787
01:28:36,922 --> 01:28:38,856
That's the only way they could
get close to the <i>Devonshire,,,

788
01:28:39,024 --> 01:28:41,218
...so they could drill inside
the missile room.

789
01:28:41,993 --> 01:28:45,087
Remember? They stole
a cruise missile from that ship.

790
01:28:45,329 --> 01:28:48,058
He said he was moving the timetable
forward to midnight.

791
01:28:48,298 --> 01:28:50,198
Yes, of course he did.

792
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,561
Under cover of darkness
he'll position the stealth boat...

793
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,362
...near the British fleet...

794
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:57,061
...fire the missile into China.

795
01:28:57,306 --> 01:29:01,002
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.

796
01:29:01,943 --> 01:29:03,706
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.

797
01:29:03,912 --> 01:29:06,278
Let's warn both our governments,
get them talking.

798
01:29:06,448 --> 01:29:08,182
It'll give us time to find the boat.

799
01:29:08,582 --> 01:29:10,311
Stand up.

800
01:29:31,936 --> 01:29:33,062
It's just like home.

801
01:29:33,237 --> 01:29:35,397
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

802
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:44,368
On second thought, you type.

803
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:46,639
First we have to find the boat.

804
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,977
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang...

805
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,986
...22 are in
highly populated areas.

806
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:57,646
That leaves 14
where he could hide a stealth boat.

807
01:29:57,891 --> 01:29:59,654
You can see it during the day.

808
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:02,260
It's invisible to radar,
but not the human eye.

809
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:06,490
Very novel.

810
01:30:07,566 --> 01:30:09,624
He'd have to hide it
someplace where...

811
01:30:09,801 --> 01:30:11,996
...he could sail to the <i>Devonshire</i>
and back in one night.

812
01:30:13,805 --> 01:30:14,931
This looks familiar.

813
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,802
- We've made some improvements.
- Have you, indeed?

814
01:30:19,009 --> 01:30:23,104
Okay. Four hours out
and four hours back.

815
01:30:23,646 --> 01:30:27,241
Assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.

816
01:30:29,918 --> 01:30:32,648
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.

817
01:30:33,889 --> 01:30:35,447
According to this...

818
01:30:35,624 --> 01:30:38,285
...there are four places
where he could harbor the boat.

819
01:30:38,459 --> 01:30:40,188
Up on your left.

820
01:30:42,329 --> 01:30:45,388
Run a cross-check on those areas
for anything suspicious.

821
01:30:52,404 --> 01:30:54,429
Ah, the new Walther.

822
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:56,631
I asked Q to get me one of these.

823
01:31:09,686 --> 01:31:11,915
I've got it. Look.

824
01:31:13,222 --> 01:31:15,884
Four missing boats.
Three unexplained drownings.

825
01:31:16,058 --> 01:31:17,218
That has to be it.

826
01:31:19,327 --> 01:31:21,227
Ha Long Bay.

827
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,543
He knows the island.

828
01:31:39,711 --> 01:31:43,442
He says that it's dangerous for
boats to be around there at sunset...

829
01:31:43,648 --> 01:31:46,582
...but for 5000 American dollars...

830
01:31:46,817 --> 01:31:49,342
...he'll take us.
- Good.

831
01:31:49,553 --> 01:31:51,453
Maybe he'll take a check.

832
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:08,765
It's mostly dull routine,
of course...

833
01:32:09,003 --> 01:32:12,768
...but every now and then you get to
sail on a beautiful evening like this...

834
01:32:13,006 --> 01:32:17,238
...and sometimes work with a decadent
agent of a corrupt Western power.

835
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:19,876
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.

836
01:32:21,413 --> 01:32:22,744
I hate to disappoint you...

837
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:25,274
...but I don't even have
a little red book.

838
01:32:28,887 --> 01:32:30,718
If anything happens to me...

839
01:32:30,922 --> 01:32:33,287
...the fuses for the mines
are in here.

840
01:32:36,593 --> 01:32:38,527
We're gonna finish this together.

841
01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:41,561
And if I may say so,
you found the right...

842
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:45,222
...decadent, corrupt Western agent...

843
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:47,095
...as a partner.

844
01:33:07,219 --> 01:33:09,244
- See the stealth?
- No.

845
01:33:10,055 --> 01:33:13,024
It's getting late
and this is the last cove in the bay.

846
01:33:21,431 --> 01:33:23,331
Yeah, that's it.

847
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:54,123
Set the timers for 10 minutes.

848
01:33:54,293 --> 01:33:57,193
That'll give us time to get out of
here before the ship explodes.

849
01:33:57,362 --> 01:33:59,922
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.

850
01:34:00,131 --> 01:34:02,963
- Our fleets will finish the job.
- lf they got our message.

851
01:34:03,167 --> 01:34:06,466
- Okay, you, up and over.
- Okay.

852
01:34:21,882 --> 01:34:23,782
<i>We're in position</i>
<i>between the fleets,

853
01:34:24,285 --> 01:34:28,016
Fire one missile
at the flagship of each fleet.

854
01:34:28,222 --> 01:34:31,987
The Chinese will think the British
are rattling the saber...

855
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:35,718
...the British will think the Chinese
are being belligerent...

856
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:39,829
...and the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

857
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,026
Let the mayhem begin.

858
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:55,539
Missile lock-on.

859
01:34:55,712 --> 01:34:59,909
Send a signal to the Admiralty:
"Task group under missile attack."

860
01:35:01,751 --> 01:35:04,981
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MiG 21 s inbound.

861
01:35:05,153 --> 01:35:07,713
The first group should be
on our screens in two minutes.

862
01:35:07,889 --> 01:35:11,984
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?

863
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:13,183
Twelve minutes.

864
01:35:14,128 --> 01:35:16,925
What the hell do I pay you for?

865
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,133
If she's there, Bond is there.

866
01:35:23,335 --> 01:35:24,734
Stamper, find them.

867
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:33,438
Wai Lin! Wai Lin! Camera!

868
01:35:42,852 --> 01:35:44,512
If she blinks, kill her.

869
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:46,443
You come with me.

870
01:36:32,761 --> 01:36:35,696
<i>Stamper to Bridge, Bond is dead,

871
01:36:35,897 --> 01:36:37,159
Delicious.

872
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:40,596
Make sure you clear all the mines,
and bring the girl up to me.

873
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:48,131
Are you sure you want her up here?

874
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:50,974
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

875
01:36:51,211 --> 01:36:52,837
I like an audience.

876
01:36:59,016 --> 01:37:00,950
Ah, Miss Lin.

877
01:37:01,452 --> 01:37:04,114
Your countrymen are being
so cooperative...

878
01:37:04,288 --> 01:37:06,619
...so predictably eager
to save face.

879
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:09,953
My government knows you're
out here. They're looking for you.

880
01:37:10,961 --> 01:37:12,860
Not according to our radar...

881
01:37:13,028 --> 01:37:17,328
...where it seems your MiGs are
about to attack the British fleet...

882
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,024
...in how many minutes?

883
01:37:19,267 --> 01:37:21,167
Nine minutes to firing range.

884
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,861
And even if they were
looking for me...

885
01:37:24,105 --> 01:37:25,504
...we're on a stealth boat.

886
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:29,475
They can't see me, or you...

887
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:31,668
...or even your friend...

888
01:37:31,845 --> 01:37:33,334
...the late Commander Bond...

889
01:37:33,513 --> 01:37:38,541
...who is at this moment on his way
to the bottom of the South China Sea.

890
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:40,950
He's my new anchorman.

891
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:55,164
Pathetic.

892
01:37:59,569 --> 01:38:01,661
What on earth's going on?

893
01:38:01,870 --> 01:38:04,100
A message from 007...

894
01:38:04,339 --> 01:38:07,102
...just confirmed by
my opposite number in China.

895
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:11,539
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship
that's almost invisible to radar."

896
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,037
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

897
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:17,550
Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.

898
01:38:19,786 --> 01:38:22,583
Admiral, sir,
urgent message from the Admiralty.

899
01:38:25,023 --> 01:38:26,217
Look at this.

900
01:38:27,792 --> 01:38:32,092
Anything on radar that looks small?
Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

901
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:35,699
- No, sir.
- Stealth boat, sir? They've gone mad.

902
01:38:42,972 --> 01:38:47,602
What you're about to witness, Miss
Lin, is not so much a missile attack...

903
01:38:47,777 --> 01:38:49,676
...but the launch
of a new world order.

904
01:38:49,878 --> 01:38:54,679
In five minutes, after your countrymen
have attacked the British fleet...

905
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:57,749
I shall retaliate
for dear old England...

906
01:38:57,985 --> 01:39:00,681
...by sending this missile
into Beijing...

907
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:04,180
...where General Chang has just
called an emergency meeting...

908
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:06,415
...of the Chinese high command.

909
01:39:06,592 --> 01:39:08,116
Unfortunately...

910
01:39:09,594 --> 01:39:12,722
...General Chang
will be delayed in traffic...

911
01:39:13,265 --> 01:39:17,598
...arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders...

912
01:39:17,768 --> 01:39:22,534
...and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.

913
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:27,933
But he'll be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce...

914
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:30,738
...and emerge as a world leader...

915
01:39:30,946 --> 01:39:33,380
...with the Nobel Peace Prize.

916
01:39:33,582 --> 01:39:35,641
- And what do you get?
- Me?

917
01:39:36,584 --> 01:39:38,950
Oh, nothing.

918
01:39:40,121 --> 01:39:44,147
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next hundred years.

919
01:39:46,827 --> 01:39:48,886
Ready to rock and ruin.

920
01:39:49,728 --> 01:39:53,095
If you'll excuse me, my dear,
I have a deadline to meet.

921
01:39:53,299 --> 01:39:54,732
Prepare for the missile launch.

922
01:39:58,570 --> 01:39:59,662
Mr. Gupta.

923
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:02,103
Hello, Elliot.

924
01:40:02,307 --> 01:40:04,171
Interesting plan.

925
01:40:04,675 --> 01:40:07,007
<i>But I think I have</i>
<i>something that belongs to you,

926
01:40:07,177 --> 01:40:10,304
So much for German efficiency.
Mr. Stamper.

927
01:40:19,688 --> 01:40:21,849
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.

928
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:26,256
Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr. Bond.

929
01:40:26,994 --> 01:40:28,518
Even trade, Elliot.

930
01:40:28,696 --> 01:40:30,424
Gupta for Wai Lin.

931
01:40:30,597 --> 01:40:32,656
You can't fire the missile
without him.

932
01:40:33,433 --> 01:40:36,368
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

933
01:40:37,202 --> 01:40:39,966
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

934
01:40:40,172 --> 01:40:43,198
I told you we're going to
finish this together.

935
01:40:43,809 --> 01:40:45,275
How romantic.

936
01:40:46,177 --> 01:40:49,442
Do you realize
how absurd your position is?

937
01:40:49,647 --> 01:40:52,206
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.

938
01:40:52,449 --> 01:40:57,284
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.

939
01:40:57,487 --> 01:41:00,512
Look at William Randolph Hearst,
who told his photographers:

940
01:41:00,689 --> 01:41:04,147
"You provide the pictures,
I'll provide the war."

941
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,452
I've just taken it one step further.

942
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:12,559
Sorry about that.

943
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,031
I tuned out there
for a moment, Elliot.

944
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:16,863
Touch.

945
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:19,163
Mr. Gupta...

946
01:41:19,338 --> 01:41:20,999
...is the missile ready to fire?

947
01:41:21,173 --> 01:41:23,505
Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.

948
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:27,678
Then it seems
you've outlived your contract.

949
01:41:30,248 --> 01:41:33,114
You see, Mr. Bond,
I have a backup plan.

950
01:41:34,418 --> 01:41:36,010
So do I.

951
01:41:59,839 --> 01:42:02,000
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

952
01:42:02,676 --> 01:42:05,702
Sir, we have a small,
intermittent contact on the surface.

953
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:08,641
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

954
01:42:08,847 --> 01:42:12,839
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear
it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

955
01:42:13,051 --> 01:42:17,078
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on the
Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

956
01:42:17,255 --> 01:42:19,848
Send the message
to the Chinese fleet commander:

957
01:42:20,023 --> 01:42:21,422
"Have sighted unknown ship..."

958
01:42:21,591 --> 01:42:24,355
Get those fires out!

959
01:42:24,561 --> 01:42:26,528
Get down there
and protect the missile.

960
01:42:26,729 --> 01:42:31,166
Oh, and Mr. Stamper,
would you please kill those bastards?

961
01:42:48,181 --> 01:42:49,808
Nice work.

962
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:55,209
They're speeding up.

963
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,548
- We have to stop the boat.
- Can you take care of the engine room?

964
01:42:58,724 --> 01:43:01,055
- Of course.
- Good. Do it and get off the ship.

965
01:43:03,194 --> 01:43:04,821
I'm going to stop the missile.

966
01:43:15,004 --> 01:43:17,768
Signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.

967
01:43:18,741 --> 01:43:20,504
"To Royal Navy Task Group:

968
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:23,472
We also have the unknown ship
on our screens.

969
01:43:23,644 --> 01:43:26,010
We will not fire
unless it turns towards China.

970
01:43:26,214 --> 01:43:28,511
Until then, she's yours.
Good hunting."

971
01:43:28,749 --> 01:43:31,912
Now, captain, whatever
the hell that thing is, sink it.

972
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:35,451
Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?

973
01:43:35,654 --> 01:43:36,848
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

974
01:43:37,023 --> 01:43:39,014
We'll do it the old-fashioned way.

975
01:43:46,831 --> 01:43:48,661
Bond turned us into the target.

976
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:50,725
Along with himself.

977
01:43:50,934 --> 01:43:52,993
Take evasive action.

978
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:55,798
Prepare the missile countdown
immediately.

979
01:43:56,005 --> 01:44:00,442
Initializing launch sequence.
T minus five minutes and counting.

980
01:44:00,643 --> 01:44:04,009
<i>T minus five minutes and counting,

981
01:44:04,179 --> 01:44:06,204
Sir, they're making 48 knots.

982
01:44:06,381 --> 01:44:08,848
They'll be out of range
in two minutes.

983
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:10,984
Keep firing. Slow them down.

984
01:45:13,505 --> 01:45:16,906
The engines are out. We're sitting
ducks here. Engine room.

985
01:45:57,976 --> 01:45:59,136
Follow me!

Well done.

Keep firing!

989
01:47:41,464 --> 01:47:42,954
All hands, abandon ship.

990
01:47:43,366 --> 01:47:44,697
Abandon ship.

<i>Abandon ship, Abandon ship,

992
01:48:08,988 --> 01:48:12,355
Mr. Stamper,
what are you doing about the girl?

993
01:48:12,858 --> 01:48:15,883
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

994

<i>T minus three minutes and counting,

995
01:49:15,612 --> 01:49:18,409
You're too late again, Mr. Bond.

996
01:49:19,548 --> 01:49:21,880
It's a bad habit of yours.

997
01:49:22,084 --> 01:49:23,812
There's nothing you can do.

998
01:49:32,459 --> 01:49:35,724
<i>T minus two minutes and counting,

999
01:49:35,929 --> 01:49:37,953
The missile's fully programmed.

1000
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:40,155
It can't be stopped.

1001
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:42,390
In minutes my plan will succeed.

1002
01:49:44,336 --> 01:49:46,395
And thanks largely to your efforts...

1003
01:49:46,604 --> 01:49:48,902
...the British Navy
will destroy the evidence...

1004
01:49:49,074 --> 01:49:52,270
...and I'll be out of here
in a Carver news helicopter...

1005
01:49:52,476 --> 01:49:53,966
...covering the event.

1006
01:49:54,178 --> 01:49:57,305
It's going to be a fantastic show.

1007
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:00,347
I may have some breaking news
for you, Elliot.

1008
01:50:05,554 --> 01:50:09,650
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot:

1009
01:50:12,493 --> 01:50:14,358
Give the people what they want.

1010

It's over, Stamper.

1014

Let her go.

1015
01:50:54,829 --> 01:50:56,296
Not between you and me.

1016
01:50:58,465 --> 01:51:01,901
James, try the detonators.
The missile will set them off.

1017
01:51:02,469 --> 01:51:05,130
