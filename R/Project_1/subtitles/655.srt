1
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,948
Attila? Where are you, boy?
Did you get that rabbit? Did you?

2
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:24,209
I'll bet you did. My mighty hunter.
You vicious killer. That's my dog.

3
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,917
That's my beast!
Come on, give me a kiss.

4
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,399
Wait a minute. Wait a damn minute.

5
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,978
Attila? And you call yourself security?

6
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,651
Don't change the subject.

7
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,669
Hey, George.

8
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,420
You gonna just stand there or are you
gonna help me with these boxes?

9
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,173
Now what have you got me carrying?

10
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,422
Got a deal on solar panels
and batteries.

11
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,183
Well, I told you I wasn't doing
any more improvements on the house

12
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,512
- I'm selling this place someday.
- Yeah, right.

13
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,347
But I see you improved
the garden anyway.

14
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,240
Yeah, and that goddamn rabbit
still got in there.

15
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,695
I told you
he went under your fence, George.

16
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,193
- He did not.
- He did, too!

17
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,116
I put that fence a foot and a half
underneath the ground.

18
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,529
Well, it's a mystery, George.

19
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:44,202
Anyway, this solar outfit, it's going to
save you money and it's free.

20
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,544
- So happy birthday.
- Thanks, Nate. Thank you.

21
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,548
- Who's gonna put it together?
- Not me.

22
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,808
It comes with a manual
in three different languages.

23
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,130
Forget it. Look, if it's a car I can fix it.

24
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,722
If it's in the garden
I probably can grow it.

25
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,982
But this is way out
of my neighborhood.

26
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,488
Hey, are you bringing a date tonight?

27
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,985
No. You?

28
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,447
Well, I'm thinking of asking somebody.

29
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,664
When? Today? You don't give them
much notice, do you?

30
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,288
Well, you even ask anybody?

31
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,333
I always ask Diana Ross,
but she never says yes to me.

32
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,000
- See you.
- See you later.

33
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,689
Hey, Bill!

34
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,278
Hey, George.
George, I forgot to tell you, man.

35
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,285
Hold on, hold on.

36
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,459
Doctor called.

37
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,170
Banes, will you let me figure it out?

38
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,293
At 10300. At 10:00. At 10100.

39
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,976
- He wants you to look at his window.
- Man!

40
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,365
How're you doing, Lace?
You look great.

41
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:50,331
- Yeah. How are the chairs selling?
- I got one left. I need four more.

42
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:55,416
Wow. It's going a lot better
than I expected.

43
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,842
Yeah, well, you know,
people sit down a lot around here.

44
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,170
Yeah.

45
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,220
- Here, I can get these.
- No, I got it, thanks.

46
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,596
Well, I'll help you.

47
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,687
Hey, Lace, there's a party tonight
at the Elkhorn Bar...

48
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,610
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.

49
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,188
I don't know.
They just always called it the Elkhorn.

50
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,941
Why? They got some poor elk's horn
hanging over the bar?

51
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,613
I don't think so.

52
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,778
Anyway, it's my birthday today, and
there's a party tonight at the Elkhorn.

53
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,407
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yeah.

54
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,208
- George!
- I gotta look up here at 10:00.

55
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,456
- Why'?
- Well, that's Doc Brunder's office.

56
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,300
- Have you met him yet?
- No. What does he want?

57
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,422
I don't know.

58
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,425
So, hey, you think
you could come to the party tonight?

59
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,753
No, I don't like to leave my kids
home alone at night.

60
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,553
- I know a good babysitter.
- I just live really far...

61
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,597
Tito's wife. You know Tito. Tito? Tito!

62
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,348
- Hey, George.
- Hey, that's nice.

63
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,724
Oh, God.

64
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,982
- So that's the doctor?
- Yep, that's the doctor.

65
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,820
- Would you please come tonight?
- No, not tonight.

66
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,576
- Is it me'?
- No, it's not you.

67
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,661
Well, then I'll keep asking.

68
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,500
Man, I would love to get my hands
on your carburetor.

69
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,940
I bet you would.

70
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,144
- You say, "She sock it to you."
- Yeah, get back to work, guys.

71
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,787
Hey, Nate. Nate.

72
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,211
It's a scandal, you and Diana Ross.
I told the press.

73
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,583
- Oh, man.
- Yup.

74
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,291
She'd be so happy on my farm.
No stress.

75
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,968
- It's true.
- No media, no press.

76
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,387
- Nothing.
- Just heaven.

77
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,136
Hey, you're not supposed to be
buying drinks tonight.

78
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,974
- Yo!

79
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,893
George doesn't buy drinks tonight.
It's his birthday.

80
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,312
- Hey, Doc! Hey, you made it!
- For you.

81
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,105
Hey, hi!

82
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,645
- How's everybody?
- Hey.

83
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,564
Still breathing in and out?

84
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,644
Hey, Doc, you gotta try this.
You got to try that cake.

85
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,402
- What?
- Tito's wife made it. It is macho bueno.

86
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,154
- Macho.
- As usual.

87
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,988
Doc. Thank you.

88
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,156
- Hey, Jimmy!
- You're welcome.

89
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,742
You're learning the moves, George,

90
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,823
but you've never played
amidst turmoil and confusion.

91
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,746
So, here we go.

92
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,668
I wish we could go back to checkers.
Maybe I could win.

93
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,255
No, no, no. You have potential, George.

94
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,254
I always said George Malley has
something extra to offer this world.

95
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,303
I said that the day I circumcised you.

96
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,757
- He says that every birthday.
- It was a bad joke, I know.

97
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,425
You know you ruined my chance
of romance today

98
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,853
- with that obscene stunt in the window.
- It was an outrage.

99
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,266
- It was a disgrace!
- It was a criminal act.

100
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,440
Okay, there was a beautiful girl
who walked right away from me.

101
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,517
- It was so embarrassing.
- George, you talking about the one

102
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,360
- with the chairs?
- Yeah.

103
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,855
- They are not all that comfortable.
- Well, I think they're perfect.

104
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,691
- But you gotta learn how to sit in them.
- Here you go.

105
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,534
On the house, everybody.
Happy birthday!

106
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,870
Jimmy. Jimmy, there's no
smoking section in heaven, you know.

107
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,390
Come on. Don't start, Doc, don't start.

108
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:18,368
- Pass those out. Here <i>pass</i> them out.
- Georgie, happy cumpleafios, amigo.

109
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,543
<i>Happy cumpleafios.</i>

110
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,121
Hey, buddy, cheers.

111
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,470
- Happy birthday.
- We love you, man.

112
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,461
- You all set?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,430
This is great.

114
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,881
This is great.

115
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,389
Tito, wait, wait, wait. Tito!

116
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,580
Thanks for coming to my party, man.

117
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,180
- Happy birthday, kid.
- Yeah, happy birthday.

118
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,730
Yup, happy birthday.

119
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.

120
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,258
Anybody see that'? That light?

121
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,850
- What kind of light?
- You know, there was a noise.

122
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,910
- Did you hear it?
- No.

123
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,968
Could we finish the game, George?

124
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:00,889
Man, it was like an explosion,
and there was a flash.

125
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,143
- Like a plane?
- No, it was bigger than that.

126
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,896
I mean it was farther away.

127
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,272
You mean like a star, George?

128
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,689
- Man, it knocked me off my feet.
- You fell?

129
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,195
Yeah, I fell! I was hit right

130
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,492
- The man's inebriated.
- I warned you.

131
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,289
- I am not drunk, Nate.
- I'm taking your queen, George.

132
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,495
- Now pay attention.
- Isn't that checkmate?

133
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:30,542
- That's checkmate, isn't it?
- You mean he beat you?

134
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,295
You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?

135
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,960
I didn't let him win anything.

136
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,133
You're a little pissed off about that,
aren't you'?

137
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,435
- Play another one?
- You can get your revenge on me

138
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,978
- tomorrow, all right?
- Yeah.

139
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,430
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah.

140
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,436
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

141
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,565
- Hey, thanks, everybody.
- Happy birthday, buddy.

142
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,571
- Happy birthday, George.
- That was a good party.

143
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,217
I can't sleep.

144
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,178
That's it!

145
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,446
- What?
- I figured it out.

146
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,491
Jesus, George,
what are you doing calling me? It's late.

147
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,536
I thought that farmers got up
when it was still dark.

148
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,332
That's if you have cows.
I don't have any cows, George.

149
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,820
Now, look, there's only one explanation
for that rabbit.

150
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,959
- What?
- You see, when I built that fence

151
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,382
higher and deeper,
he was already in there.

152
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,677
See, he was hiding. I fenced him in.

153
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,213
<i>There's only one thing I can do now,</i>

154
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,846
<i>- just let</i> him out.
- Good night, George. Good night.

155
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,823
Here's Roger.

156
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,996
George, can I have my Bronco back?

157
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,915
I don't have any cash right now,
but I need my car.

158
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,994
Well, I need some solar panels
installed on my roof.

159
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,750
I don't know anything about solar.

160
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,299
Well, Charlie Shipper does, and
he needs a well dug on his property.

161
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:20,254
You help him dig the well, he'll help me
with the panels, and I'll fix your car.

162
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,840
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal!

163
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,685
I'll call Charlie.

164
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,141
- Hi. I just called about fixing my brakes.
- Yeah, yeah. Be right with you.

165
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,483
Tito.

166
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,323
- Come on.
- Tito,

167
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,454
he speaks Spanish
better than I do now.

168
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,831
Yeah, better than me, too.

169
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,288
Right. Where's the owner and operator
of this vehicle?

170
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,744
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.

171
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,503
Mmm-hmm.

172
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,820
- You got the brake on, sport?
- His name's Al.

173
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,543
- And what's your name?
- Glory.

174
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,428
Well, I'm George.

175
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:48,429
- Pop the hood, AI.
- Why?

176
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,269
- You know how to start this thing?
- Duh.

177
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,394
Emergency road service, ma'am.

178
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,397
Your truck can't breathe,
and your idle's too fast.

179
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,729
Sorry. Gotta go.

180
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,656
Where? You're not leaving town,
are you?

181
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,825
No, just San Francisco for the day.

182
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,870
I used to live there. Ask me directions
on where you're going.

183
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,390
As a matter of fact,
ask me anything at all.

184
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,992
You could even ask me to come along.
I'd show you the sights, the hazards.

185
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,669
- What do you think?
- I think your idle's too fast.

186
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,454
San Francisco?

187
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,170
- But you were born here, right?
- How'd you know I was born here?

188
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,550
Just now in the store someone said,
"I've known George Malley all my life,

189
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,847
"and if he said he saw a UFO,
he saw one."

190
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,559
- I didn't say that.
- You saw one?

191
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:36,640
- But I didn't say what I saw.
- What'd it look like?

192
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,474
Well, it could've been.

193
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,240
- That's mate, Doc.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. George!

194
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,407
Now, what in the hell is going on here?
What?

195
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,115
Look, you know, I don't know, Doc.
I really don't know.

196
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:56,497
Just lately, I've been seeing things
so clearly, you know.

197
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:01,540
And, you know,
I understand right away. I concentrate.

198
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,427
And books, I can't stop feeding myself.
I read two, three books a day.

199
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:11,724
Imagine that. And then, you know,
I can't stop, and I can't sleep.

200
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,935
You know, ever since the...

201
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,107
I gotta go. Get back to work.

202
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,981
- Ever since...
- The sighting.

203
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,941
- Roger, it was a damn light.
- And a boom.

204
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,447
- Now, did you hear it?
- Well, no.

205
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,789
Anybody? About nine days ago
right outside here?

206
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,585
Was that 12:00, George?

207
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,912
George, come in for a physical, okay?

208
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,301
George?

209
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,302
- Two or three books a day?
- At least.

210
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,888
- About what?
- About everything.

211
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,141
You know, all the things
I've wanted to know about and learn.

212
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,349
- Like what?
- Well, you tell me, Rog.

213
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,811
I mean, what have you always wanted
to know about and learn, hmm?

214
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,906
Think about it.

215
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:46,754
CQ, this is WB-6. QLF, standing
by. Searcher out of Harmon, California.

216
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,581
Is anybody in the void tonight?

217
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,794
I'm looking for Diana Ross, but I'll
accept any voice in the English tongue.

218
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,425
Is that you, Diana? Hey, George.

219
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,602
Look, Nate,
you haven't sat till you've put your ass

220
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,600
on one of these homemade
willow chairs, okay?

221
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,556
Now, I brought you a pair
so you can put your feet up,

222
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,900
or if you want a friend to sit in there,

223
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,521
if you decide one day and invite
someone over. What do you think?

224
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,405
- I don't think they go, George.
- What would you know?

225
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:21,760
Looks like a swap meet blew in here.
Talk about needing a woman's touch.

226
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,325
This is an emergency.

227
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,331
Hey, Nate, I've been working
on that solar kit you gave me.

228
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,756
I am telling you, the whole field of
photovoltaics is just in baby land.

229
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,628
I mean, you know,
the idea that plants have been storing

230
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,884
and using the sun's energy
since the birth of the world,

231
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,386
I mean,
photosynthesis is a model for us.

232
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,468
And we're just scratching the surface
of what we could do

233
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,771
with these silicon cells, I'm telling you.

234
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,394
What?

235
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,315
What?

236
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,739
You just talk so fast, George,
and you know so much stuff.

237
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,996
- I'm sorry. But I can't help it, Nate.
- That's okay.

238
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,334
What is that?

239
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,876
It's just computers
talking to computers...

240
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,420
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

241
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,169
Come on, the Morse code is
going too fast for you to pick that out.

242
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,252
- No, no, no, no, I can hear it.
- Bull.

243
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,384
No, I'll tell you what it is, a repeated
pattern. They're looping a message.

244
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,184
"Watering the golds Friday."

245
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,385
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,563
Now who'd be sending a coded
message like that in simple Morse?

247
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,892
Oh, man, look, I pick up like
two different Air Force bases.

248
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,943
I think we better leave
this one alone, George.

249
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,396
No, no, this is a different one!
Listen, listen.

250
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,859
This one's much denser, but it's still
a loop. It still repeats. Listen.

251
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,828
- Seriously, I think we...
- I got to record this.

252
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,492
- Where's your...
- I think we need to leave this alone.

253
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,581
- No, no, no, no, Nate.
- What are you doing?

254
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,455
Well, I want to take it home
so I can break it down.

255
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,662
- Then we can answer it.
- Why?

256
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,166
Because it gives me something
to do, Nate. All right?

257
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,588
I don't know if it's getting worse
or it's getting better,

258
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:04,517
but, you know,
I have 12 hours of the night to kill.

259
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,805
And when I get tired of reading

260
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,513
I do crossword puzzles,
but they're all too simple.

261
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,648
Too simple?

262
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:15,812
And then everybody I know is asleep,
and I'm awake at night.

263
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,356
Is there something I could do?

264
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,859
Hey!
Why don't we just go outside and box?

265
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,204
I could split your lip again.
You'll feel a lot better.

266
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,538
No.

267
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,960
Hey, if you send a message,
would they get it'?

268
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,500
- Yeah, sure.
- Send this.

269
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,671
Send them,
"Don't over water the golds." Say that.

270
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,465
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.

271
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,636
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, no.

272
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,215
Say, "Don't over water
the marigolds Friday."

273
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:49,391
"Don't over water
the marigolds on Friday

274
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,512
Right.

275
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,315
- "We'll be watching."
- Yeah, yeah. "We'll be watching."

276
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,314
- How about that?
- Oh, my God. This is cool.

277
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:40,230
It's okay, Attila, it's nothing. Static
electricity, that's ail. That's all it is.

278
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,912
See, here, here you go. Okay.
All right, okay.

279
00:24:55,786 --> 00:25:00,917
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, man.

280
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,762
Is somebody trying
to tell me something?

281
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,259
Huh?

282
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,967
What?

283
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,680
- Did you pee in the cup?
- Yup.

284
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,196
- You still having trouble sleeping?
- Yup.

285
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,743
Any ideas?

286
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,580
How long have you been feeling
this way?

287
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,750
Well, you know how long I've been
feeling this way. Everybody does.

288
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,453
I mean, it's been over a month
since my birthday.

289
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:43,460
- Notice anything else or...
- Yeah.

290
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:50,349
- What?
- Well, watch your fountain pen there.

291
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,768
What do you mean?

292
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,101
Ooh...

293
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,982
- That's telekinesis.
- Yeah.

294
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:12,871
- Is that okay?
- Do it again. Do it again.

295
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,297
Well...

296
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:33,130
You know, I consider myself
a rational man, a man of science.

297
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:40,170
You know, open to whatever. But I feel
like a child, George. I feel scared.

298
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,188
Me, too.

299
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:49,151
Well, whatever the reason is,
I promise you we'll find it. Okay?

300
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,201
Now, let me see you do that
one more time.

301
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,253
- It's a monster, George.
- Yup, yup.

302
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,720
This old Frankenstein here gets
90 miles to the gallon on methane.

303
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:15,940
And that's made from my garbage
and Nate's pig manure. Special blend.

304
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,594
Sure smells like it.

305
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,396
See ya, Georgie.

306
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,234
- Hello, Lace.
- Hey.

307
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,735
These are a little bit different. I used

308
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,987
- a little bit of a wider branch on these.
- Yeah, they look great.

309
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,690
- George, are these yours?
- Yeah, yeah.

310
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,953
I've been working on
some special organic fertilizers.

311
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,998
Go ahead, taste it. No, no, no.
Bite into it like an apple.

312
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,500
Oh.

313
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,254
You got some on your chin. Sorry.

314
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,549
Maybe the kids would like some.

315
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,757
It's great. Thanks.

316
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,594
No, no, no. Lace, wait.
Let me pick some out for you, okay?

317
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:02,307
If the kids like them, you know,
you could make anything.

318
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,651
You could make some sauce or a soup.

319
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,651
- George, I thought you were smart.
- Hey, what's she got anyway?

320
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,197
Yeah. Yeah,
besides uncomfortable chairs?

321
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,334
My heart, amigos, my heart.

322
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,737
Hey! George, wait.
Where do you think you're going?

323
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,158
You guys going home?
You want a ride?

324
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,831
- OKay_
- Glory!

325
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,780
What?

326
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:06,162
- Glory, come on.
- Would you come on?

327
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,626
- All right.
- Al!

328
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,833
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Hurry up!

329
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,700
- Are you scared?
- Move over.

330
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,735
- Are those for our mom?
- Yup.

331
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,242
- I thought flowers were for dates.
- Don't get spooky, Al.

332
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,243
Did she invite you?

333
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,954
Hey, wait a minute. Blue.
I don't have blue.

334
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,387
Oh, great.

335
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,229
You guys know the name
of this flower?

336
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,522
- No.
- No.

337
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,572
<i>A Delphinium belladonna.
That's the Ranunculaceae family.</i>

338
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,290
I didn't always know
about names of flowers.

339
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,863
But it seems recently that I can
pretty much name any flower I see.

340
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,322
- Really?
- Yeah.

341
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:27,911
Like this one is Limonium sinuatum.
And this is the...

342
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,890
Doesn't make them any prettier though.

343
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,219
- Is that a garbage-bag tie?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,472
I was improvising.

345
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,595
- Hey, now that's a good idea.
- Yup.

346
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,486
- That's much better.
- Yu p.

347
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,572
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

348
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,298
My mom's around back!

349
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:24,475
Lace? Hi.

350
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,595
Hi.

351
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,100
Now, you didn't nearly take
enough tomatoes.

352
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,274
And I'm very proud of them.

353
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,613
Well, there you go. And I got you these.

354
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,492
Well, that's every wildflower
from my house to your house.

355
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,403
Your kids helped.

356
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,954
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

357
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:50,542
- Hey, what are you working on?
- Nothing. Nothing.

358
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,754
Look at this. Wow.
That's really great work.

359
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:58,335
- Look at this. Beautiful.
- You want to walk?

360
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,418
Sure.

361
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,890
I gotta tell, you know,
you got great kids.

362
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,804
Yeah, they are great kids.

363
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,556
But you don't really know that yet,
George,

364
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,772
because you don't know them
and you don't know me.

365
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,475
- But I'm trying to get to know you.
- I know.

366
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,813
I really want to keep my life
very simple, even predictable.

367
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,363
That's why I moved here.

368
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:25,991
I don't like surprises,
and I don't like complications.

369
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,706
Well, what happened to you, Lace?

370
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,840
I'm sorry. That's none of my business.

371
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,794
- No, no, it's okay.
- I'm stupid.

372
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,622
I'm so sorry.

373
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,128
So let me ask you something, George.

374
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,301
When a man comes over
with a basketful of tomatoes,

375
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,549
what is he expecting? Dinner?

376
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,174
No, no, no. Just hoping.

377
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,644
<i>Trifolium. Look</i> at...

378
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,558
You don't have any purple
in the flowers I got you, do you?

379
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,590
Whoa...

380
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,812
- Did you did you feel that?
- Feel what?

381
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,821
- Come here. Come here, let's see.
- Okay.

382
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,749
- Feel that right there.
- Feel what?

383
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,756
- Oh, God. I think I know what this is.
- What?

384
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,252
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

385
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,175
Yeah, thanks.

386
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,594
Okay, yeah.

387
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,344
Just east of Harmon. Do you know
which one I'm talking about?

388
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,764
No, well, I was told to call you,
and I'm telling you right now

389
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,266
that I picked up on some activity.

390
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,939
No, we didn't use any instrumentation.

391
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,944
No, I don't have a degree,
and I haven't studied anywhere.

392
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,210
But I'm just trying to...
Are you shutting me down here?

393
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,199
Is that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?

394
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,619
Look, I'm just trying to tell you that I felt
the compression waves, okay?

395
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,706
ULF, ultra-low frequency waves.
Now, they have the ability to make

396
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,954
you nauseous and dizzy. Am I right?

397
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,869
Okay, well, that's what I felt,
and I'm trying to tell you

398
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,954
that I think that there...

399
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,129
There's an earthquake coming.

400
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,968
Um...

401
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,797
Listen, Al, why don't you put some
masking tape on the cupboards?

402
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,633
And, Glory,
take the vases down and the china.

403
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,226
Okay.

404
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:44,800
This is good, Lace.
I think you're a good cook.

405
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:52,593
No, I'm not. I only make two things
pretty well, pork chops and turkey.

406
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,473
Which is this?

407
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,188
I'm just...

408
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,206
Look!

409
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:29,845
- Al. I'm gonna kill you.
- I was just joking.

410
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,674
You scared me.

411
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,641
Not funny.

412
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,487
Thanks.

413
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,623
- All right, can I say it now?
- What's that?

414
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,872
- You've got great kids.
- Thanks.

415
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,703
- And I thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

416
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,415
- And good night.
- Good night.

417
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,584
- Good night.
- Okay.

418
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,900
Shh! She's coming.

419
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,676
- Tell her.
- No, you tell her.

420
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,350
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?

421
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,250
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO,

422
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,978
and he thinks
he can predict earthquakes.

423
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,938
There may be a warning here.

424
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,240
But he never said for sure
it was a UFO.

425
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,658
Yeah.

426
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,400
Let's get in the truck. Get in the truck!

427
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,627
- It's over, Mom.
- I know it's over! Let's go now!

428
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,813
Did you feel it, huh?
Did you get scared?

429
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:11,484
Do you realize the possibilities of this?
Do you know what this means?

430
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,497
You felt it, didn't you?

431
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,743
- You did.
- What is going on, George?

432
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,750
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.

433
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:30,173
I don't know. I don't.
I don't know what's happening.

434
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,800
I need the simple truth, George.

435
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,346
This is the truth.
What's happening to me is the truth.

436
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,815
Oh, no.

437
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,988
Lace.

438
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:10,627
I love those chairs, Lace. I love them.

439
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,882
You made them, okay? All right?

440
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,548
I wanted to see you, okay? I mean...

441
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,134
Bring them back
to your shop tomorrow.

442
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,470
- I'll give you your money back.
- I don't want my money back, Lace.

443
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:29,580
I just asked you for one thing, George.
The truth. And you couldn't handle it.

444
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,175
- George, haven't you called her yet?
- Never mind about that, will you, Nate?

445
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,923
Now this is the second one, gladiolus.
Remember that.

446
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,761
How do you know
she's still mad at you?

447
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,256
- I know. Now, all right...
- Write her a note.

448
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,885
No, no, no. I found this.
Classic five-bed garden pattern. Here

449
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,110
Flowers. You should send her flowers
or candies.

450
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,518
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolas,
roses, et cetera.

451
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,272
And I went to the library
and I looked up the missile silo pattern

452
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,857
at the Masterson Air Force Base,
and I made my own overlay.

453
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,692
And here we go. There.

454
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,118
- Yeah.
- See that?

455
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:27,495
That's their garden. You see? Well,
that's old stuff, and it's declassified.

456
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,121
But now this stuff is trickier.

457
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,545
This is trigraphs
and tetragraphs and ABBA class.

458
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,963
- George.
- Yep'?

459
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,665
Why don't you just tell me
what you want me to send?

460
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,922
All right. Okay, send this.
Why don't you send this?

461
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,846
"Mind your garden. Frost coming.
Luck on the Mozop."

462
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,673
You want to know what "Mozop" is?

463
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,975
That's okay. It's your game, George.

464
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,223
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you sit in this chair yet?

465
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,600
- It's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

466
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,181
You should give her a call right now.

467
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:56,270
No, let her cool off.
I figure I'll give her about a year.

468
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,694
Pick up the phone
and call her, George.

469
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,822
Look who's talking.
Diana Ross fan club.

470
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,621
Have you said 10 words
to a woman this year?

471
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,872
- I'm sorry, Nate.
- Your transmission's finished, sir.

472
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,843
I've just been going through
some things lately.

473
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,886
Everybody's going through something.

474
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,341
I know, but this thing's been
hard for me to handle.

475
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,640
Let me show you something.

476
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:07,554
- You suppose they magnetized you?
- I don't know, buddy. I wish I did.

477
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,727
- What've we got here?
- Hurry up. Get in there, Doc.

478
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,154
- Get right in.
- Doc, you better hurry.

479
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,201
One of you go to the garbage and
bring me any food containers you find.

480
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,787
Somebody else go in the cabinets
and look for damaged or swollen cans.

481
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,330
- Food poisoning.
- I think.

482
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,458
Now what the hell is he saying?
Who speaks Spanish?

483
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:40,131
That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.

484
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,753
Portuguese?

485
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,342
He's trying to tell us
something about Berto.

486
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,840
That's the little one. It's a little boy.

487
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,800
All right, some of you
search around here for the kid.

488
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,386
I'm going to tell you that right now
he could be pretty darn sick.

489
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:57,940
Now, Bonnie, wait. Get on the phone
and get George Malley over here.

490
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,984
Tell him what's going on
and tell him to stop at the library

491
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,270
for a English-Portuguese book.

492
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:06,984
Tell him to find out how to ask
where a lost boy is. Got that?

493
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,787
- George Malley?
- You bet. George.

494
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,790
Go on, do it. Just go on, go on!

495
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,214
- Don't you answer that?
- Not when I'm working.

496
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:27,759
I've been farming all my life,
but this growth is amazing, George.

497
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,346
This is embarrassing.

498
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,304
You know I want to try this fertilizer
in your south 40.

499
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,888
You just sprayed my boots.

500
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:41,670
It's the worst soil in the county. I can't
even get weeds to grow in that field.

501
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,650
But I bet we could get corn
to grow in that field.

502
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,239
You bet?
You don't have any money to bet.

503
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,783
You spent all your money on chairs,
remember?

504
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,171
- George Malley?
- Yeah, I'm George Malley.

505
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:10,305
I'm John Ringold.
We talked on the phone the other day.

506
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,676
- John Ringold?
- Yes.

507
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,928
- From Berkeley?
- Yes.

508
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,517
- All right. Hi.
- Hi.

509
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,104
- Hey, I'm glad you came by.
- Will your dog let me step out?

510
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,774
Yeah, yeah. Well,
he just has a thing for seismologists.

511
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,943
- So come on out.
- Thank you.

512
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,770
Yeah, this is my friend, Nate Pope.

513
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,446
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

514
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,990
- Okay.
- Well, let me get you a cold drink.

515
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,362
- Come on in.
- From the university?

516
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,533
Yes.

517
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,362
And we are very interested
in how you were able to

518
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,573
predict that earthquake, Mr. Malley.

519
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,780
Oh, that.

520
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,860
You see, I just picked up
the subsonic frequency waves, right?

521
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,710
And course, I was standing on the fault
so that made it easier.

522
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,209
And what instrumentation did you use?

523
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,132
- Just me.
- If you think that's something,

524
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,588
you should see him move stuff
with his brain.

525
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:56,177
Nate, never mind that. You see,
I felt the ultra-low frequency waves.

526
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,557
And they kind of made me dizzy
and nauseous, right?

527
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,979
And that's how I perceived all this.

528
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,184
We've been studying quake prediction
for 10 years.

529
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,529
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the pre-quake activity.

530
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,197
Now there is.

531
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,536
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

532
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,872
Could you come in for an experiment?

533
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,369
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

534
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:20,996
Yes.

535
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,372
Well, my department would like to
interview you and clear this up.

536
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,378
I would be so glad to come to Berkeley.

537
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,927
Do you think that I could meet
with some other departments, as well?

538
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,678
I have some experiments that
I'd like to show you. Come with me

539
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,258
They're nice.

540
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,684
All right, well, let's see.

541
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,935
Um...

542
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,902
Yes, here. Okay.
Now look, I've taken solar panels,

543
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:51,777
and I've actually germinated the seeds
that made these plants grow.

544
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,109
And trying to change
the electromagnetic field, right?

545
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,786
- Mr. Malley?
- I took incandescent light...

546
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,534
- Mr. Malley.
- ...and I turned it into sunlight,

547
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,286
which actually made these plants grow.

548
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,665
- Mr. Malley.
- Now, look, I took pig manure,

549
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:08,374
and I turned it into a fuel which I
believe will actually run an automobile.

550
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,130
All I'm interested in is the earthquake.

551
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:15,510
We need to know if that was a fluke,
a coincidence.

552
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,490
A fluke?

553
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:22,520
George, why don't you
move something with your mind?

554
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,815
Maybe move his...
Or something like that.

555
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,861
- Look, Mr. Ringold...
- Doctor.

556
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:35,284
Dr. Ringold, look,
I've got my garden out there

557
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:36,780
and that acts like a lab, right?

558
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,452
And I've got everything
that you see here,

559
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,780
but I really need to talk
to people like you, okay?

560
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,958
Hey, George!
Hey, George, you home?

561
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,331
Please don't go, okay?
Please, just please don't go.

562
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,414
Hey, George!

563
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,667
George,
Doc says you better come right now!

564
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,970
- What's the matter?
- Come on, man, it's an emergency!

565
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,298
You gotta learn how to talk
Portuguese on the way over there.

566
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:04,184
- I gotta go.
- Portuguese? Learn Portuguese?

567
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,724
Why don't you go along, Professor?

568
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,162
George, Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.

569
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,588
Hey, George.

570
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,900
- Doc, George is here.
- He's gonna be fine, George.

571
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,553
But his grandson is missing.
Now, if they ate the same thing,

572
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,500
the boy could be a lot worse off.

573
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,890
- You brought the book?
- Yeah, I have it.

574
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,343
All right, okay.
Ask him where the boy is.

575
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,684
"The orchard."
He said he's in the orchard.

576
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,439
Right, yeah, okay.

577
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,118
He said that they ate something bad
and he thinks the boy is sick.

578
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,393
Tito drove the truck
while I read the book.

579
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:29,848
George Malley, you learned the
Portuguese language in 20 minutes?

580
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,811
Not all of it.

581
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,903
- What are you looking for here, a kid?
- What's the kid's name?

582
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,108
- It's Alberto. Berto, Alberto, yeah.
- Alberto? Alberto.

583
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,576
Let's spread out and comb these trees.
Everybody, let's go. Okay.

584
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,327
- Look real careful.
- Alberto!

585
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,340
- Call out his name.
- Alberto!

586
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:55,958
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

587
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,417
Berto!

588
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,797
- Where are you, kid?
- Alberto!

589
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,765
Where are you, fella'? We're coming.

590
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,680
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

591
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,981
George, what you got?

592
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,646
What?

593
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,145
- He's not in the orchard.
- No?

594
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,696
He's sick, Doc.

595
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,118
- He's there. There.
- Where is he, George?

596
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,321
- Where?
- Over here.

597
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,310
Okay, that's good.

598
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,702
We're with you. We're with you.

599
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,205
What's going on?

600
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:34,764
- You okay, George?
- It's not me. It's him.

601
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,488
- Tell me where he is.
- I don't know. I don't know.

602
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,221
Look! There's a ladder under there!
Come on.

603
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,267
He was right!

604
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,896
He's up here!

605
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,615
Doc, you better get up here fast.

606
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,281
Good work, George.

607
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,630
So is Wednesday good for you?
Say, 2:00'?

608
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,710
- Sure, Wednesday is good.
- Should I send a car?

609
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,592
No, John, I'll get there on my own.

610
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,220
And I'll have somebody
from Solar Energy there.

611
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:55,769
- And anything else?
- Yeah, Automotive.

612
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,143
Hey, do you have
an agricultural school at Berkeley?

613
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,269
Yeah.

614
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:03,319
- Well, how about for my fertilizer?
- I'll take care of it.

615
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,201
Hey, George.

616
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,666
That's the little boy's mom.

617
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,410
She's the only one
who talks English, I think.

618
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,289
It's too bad she wasn't
here earlier, huh?

619
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:27,343
Yeah. But I guess she had to
look for work, man.

620
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,389
I want you to meet a very special guy.

621
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:35,218
This is the man who found your son,
okay? Very special.

622
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,305
This is George Malley. This is Ella.

623
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,186
Hello.

624
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,314
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

625
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,606
Thank you.

626
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,800
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?
Thanks, George.

627
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,126
Way to go, patrén.

628
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,829
Do you know what kind of work
she was looking for?

629
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,335
Cook, I think they say. Housekeeper.

630
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,836
You know somebody who's looking?

631
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:15,700
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

632
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,809
I found a housekeeper for you,
a Portuguese woman.

633
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,559
She cooks, too.
I think she's perfect for you.

634
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,390
I don't know if I could eat
Portuguese food, George.

635
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,646
Well, she'll cook you anything
you want, Nate.

636
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:28,229
And she'll try to make sense of that
so-called house that you live in.

637
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:31,236
- She speak English?
- Well, a bit but...

638
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,443
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.

639
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,720
- Me?
- Yeah.

640
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,246
- You got a problem with that?
- No, no.

641
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,449
I don't know
if that's gonna work, George.

642
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,626
All right, well, let's try it.
What do you want to say?

643
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,507
How about something like,
"Can you come twice a week?"

644
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,339
- Okay. "Can you come twice a week?"
- Okay.

645
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,841
"Can you come twice a week?"

646
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,689
- That sounds complicated, George.
- No, no, you got your tape recorder

647
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:08,816
and you learn it phonetically.
No problem. What else?

648
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,660
Uh...

649
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:13,278
- "How much per day?"
- "How much per..." Okay, good.

650
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,483
"How much per day?"

651
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,326
- I like that one.
- Yeah, yeah.

652
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,448
- That one's nice. Okay.
- What else?

653
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:26,333
Okay. "Can you start next week?"

654
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,455
Perfect. Logical, right'? Okay.

655
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,962
- Yeah, yeah.
- "Can you start next week?"

656
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,638
- Beautiful language, huh?
- That's it?

657
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,308
Yep. Work on those.

658
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,554
You know, George,
I might be pretty good at Portuguese.

659
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:01,698
No, oh... Never mind.
We'll get used to them.

660
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,992
If you leave them alone
they'll leave you alone.

661
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,170
It's a good arrangement.
What are we reading?

662
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:12,250
- This.
- What is this? Where did you get this?

663
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,584
From me.

664
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,591
This is not a good choice for bedtime.

665
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,924
- Are you still mad at him?
- What's the difference?

666
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,854
He's neat, and they say he saved
that boy's life at the orchard.

667
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,638
He's funny.

668
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,771
We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.

669
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:36,115
Look, we're reading Black Beauty,
and we are not talking about men.

670
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,693
I've got enough to worry about.
Too much.

671
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,872
- What?
- Well, you guys for one.

672
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,619
We're not little any more.

673
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,575
I know you're not little
any more, sweetie.

674
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,705
But you think that George Malley is
safe and you're afraid of coyotes.

675
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,962
You've got it all backwards. Here.
Find our place.

676
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,340
Go brush your teeth. I'll be right back.

677
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,638
- Don't you have a report to do?
- Did it.

678
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,350
"They're everywhere."
Al, do you really believe this?

679
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,898
Yeah. There's been
a lot of UFO people coming into town

680
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,568
since George saw what he saw.

681
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:15,529
The word's spreading, Ma.

682
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,277
You just believe
what you want to believe.

683
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,900
Most people do. You get over it.

684
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,743
Hey, I thought
we were getting ready for bed

685
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:26,915
No.

686
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,130
Can we stop talking about him,
all right?

687
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,751
- Why do you hate him?
- Because I like him.

688
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,923
Told you.

689
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,592
But if he was sitting here with us right
now, wouldn't you be watching him'?

690
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,434
Wondering what's he thinking?
When's he gonna leave?

691
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,685
Is he gonna leave?

692
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,771
Hmm?

693
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,938
We don't need that.

694
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,359
It's okay. Shh!

695
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,616
- He found the kid and left the...
- I heard he took 20 minutes.

696
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,666
Twenty minutes, he read the whole
damn book, knew Portuguese.

697
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,205
- You were there. He was, too!
- And then he went running around...

698
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,539
Hey, here he comes, here he comes.

699
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,545
- Hey, George.
- Hello.

700
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,297
- Hi.
- Hi.

701
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,846
So, George, how'd you feel
that earthquake coming?

702
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,679
- Voices tell you?
- Voices? Hell, no.

703
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,855
What else do you know, George?

704
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,400
Well, I know you're on the outs
with Lisa again.

705
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:36,898
How did you know that?

706
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:40,260
'Cause when she's living with you
she makes sure your clothes match.

707
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,152
Poor Banes.

708
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,950
Do you get messages, George?

709
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,620
Yeah, well, yeah,
when Paulette delivers the mail, I do.

710
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,914
But today she was two hours late.

711
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:52,334
I think we ought to do something
about that. Complain or something.

712
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,450
Earthquake, earthquake. Can we...

713
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,747
Well, Jimmy, it was...

714
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,253
I was out by Ash Creek,
and I felt some vibrations, that's all.

715
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,176
How'd you know where to find the boy
in that orchard?

716
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,490
Well, I don't know, Bonnie.
I mean, come on.

717
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:06,428
- Do you know what's going to happen?
- Roger, come on!

718
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,553
I'm sorry, I'm...

719
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,227
They say at the library
you read four books a day now.

720
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,896
Yeah, well, that was last week, and...

721
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,228
I better go.

722
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,404
How many languages
do you speak now?

723
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,362
Huh?

724
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,285
If anything bad was gonna happen,
you'd tell us.

725
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,415
Won't you? Hey!

726
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,707
- Okay, I'll be there, all right.
- All right.

727
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,883
Okay. Thanks.

728
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,434
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.

729
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,569
I'm sorry I lied to you about the chairs.

730
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:06,863
I just wanted you to come to my shop,
so you would talk to me,

731
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,453
instead of...

732
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,618
Instead of always
walking away from me.

733
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,867
What do you want, George?

734
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,962
I want you to come to Berkeley with me.

735
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,129
I've been invited to talk to some
scientists about the earthquake thing

736
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,252
and about some of my experiments.

737
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,593
You know, the fertilizer
and the solar panels and...

738
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,718
- That's really nice.
- I'm excited, but I...

739
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,895
I guess I'm scared, too.

740
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:39,350
- I sure would like you there with me.
- What for?

741
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:44,530
Support. Confidence. A friend.

742
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:48,325
You've got friends. You know everyone
in the whole area code.

743
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:51,286
I don't know, you know,
since that orchard thing, it...

744
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:54,532
People are different now.
They're... I don't like it.

745
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,991
You know, the funny thing is,

746
00:58:56,116 --> 00:59:00,246
is that you're probably the only one
that's mad at me for a good reason.

747
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,670
You're just trying to make up

748
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:12,300
Yes. I'm trying to make up with you.
I am trying to get a date with you.

749
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:14,472
And I would love it if you stood by me

750
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,722
while all those scientists
and teachers ask me questions.

751
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,933
You know,
I spent half of school in detention.

752
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,986
When?

753
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,155
- Wednesday.
- What time?

754
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,988
Leave about noon.

755
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,954
I'll be outside your shop at noon,
if I'm coming.

756
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:36,532
And if I'm not there...

757
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,828
Okay.

758
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,497
Thanks, Lace.

759
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,644
Uh...

760
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,354
One second.

761
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:09,652
One second. Here I come.

762
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,748
You are Mr. Pope?

763
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,918
You are Mr. Pope?

764
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,667
I am Michaela. Ella.

765
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,215
- You're Ella?
- Yes.

766
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,570
Wow. I'm sorry. Please.

767
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,570
Um... Maybe you need to...

768
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:44,150
Yes, this is the place. I cook, too.
You need cooking?

769
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,147
Cooking. Yeah.

770
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,820
Good. Fine. Good.

771
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,317
How much you pay?

772
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:51,569
Uh...

773
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,151
Wait.

774
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,573
Um...

775
01:00:56,695 --> 01:00:58,663
I speak a little Portuguese.

776
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,925
I don't know what you just said,
but it sounded great.

777
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,671
Sorry.

778
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:18,850
Okay, tomorrow I come back.
9:00, okay?

779
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,428
I work, and we talk about money.

780
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,180
No, wait.

781
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,356
That's all I really know.

782
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,941
That, and, um...

783
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,430
Is that right?

784
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,580
You're cute.

785
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,260
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

786
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,589
Tomorrow, then.

787
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,313
CQ, CQ?

788
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,313
This is WB-6, QLF.

789
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:19,783
Diana, if you can hear me,
I know you'll understand this.

790
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:27,920
I just met an angel from Portugal,

791
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:33,251
here in my house.

792
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,458
You George Malley?

793
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,211
Jack Hatch, FBI.

794
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,802
Nate Pope sent a coded message
to Masterson Air Force Base.

795
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:21,632
No, no, no, Nate Pope did not send a
coded message to the Air Force base.

796
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:22,807
I did.

797
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,550
Well, who taught you the cipher,
Mr. Malley?

798
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,975
Nobody. I just broke the code.

799
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,727
Who trained you?

800
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:34,690
As I said, nobody. I... Man.

801
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,571
Mmm-hmm.

802
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,810
Well?

803
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,839
- Can't do it.
- You can do it, Mr. Malley.

804
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,341
Too complex.

805
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,894
We're releasing Nathan Pope.

806
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,353
It's about time. Can I talk to him?

807
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,562
No.

808
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,608
Try this one.

809
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,533
You know, it was just a game, okay?
I mean, a game.

810
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,536
You caused the cancellation
of a top-secret training exercise,

811
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,119
Mr. Malley, the scrapping
of an entire cipher system.

812
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,420
You cost the government
a lot of money.

813
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,291
So, bill me.

814
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,232
I think he's what he says he is, a fluke.

815
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:57,402
He's an independent,
playing some kind of genius games.

816
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,275
I want him tested.

817
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:04,151
- Can't keep holding him.
- Yes, we can. He resisted arrest.

818
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,653
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

819
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,285
Test him.

820
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:16,456
All right, I'll start the questions
and I'll be timing your responses.

821
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,920
And we'll be recording. Any questions?

822
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:25,130
- What's your first name?
- My first name is Bob.

823
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,927
- Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.

824
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,181
Right.

825
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,432
Name as many mammals
<i>as</i> you can in 60 seconds.

826
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,517
Ready? Go.

827
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,250
Hmm. Sixty seconds.
Well, how would you like that?

828
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,943
How about alphabetical?

829
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,696
Aardvark, baboon, caribou,
dolphin, eohippus, fox, gorilla,

830
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:49,867
hyena, ibex, jackal, kangaroo, lion,
marmoset, Newfoundland, ocelot,

831
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:54,368
panda, rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn,
varmint, whale, yak, zebra.

832
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,870
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland.

833
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,963
That's a dog breed.

834
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,132
Unicorn is mythical.
Eohippus is prehistoric.

835
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,882
But you weren't being very specific
now, were you, Bob?

836
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,226
Well, I'll...

837
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,560
I'll try to be more specific.

838
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,979
- You ready for the next one?
- Shoot.

839
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:24,640
Answer <i>as</i> quickly as you can.
How old is a person born in 1928?

840
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,660
Man or woman?

841
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,245
- Why?
- Specifics, Bob.

842
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,198
Okay, one more time.

843
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,414
How old is a man born in 1928?

844
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,996
Still alive?

845
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:49,848
If a man is born in 1928,
and he's still alive, how old is he?

846
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:51,391
What month?

847
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:58,183
If a man was born October 3rd, 1928,

848
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,437
and he's still alive, how old is he?

849
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:04,938
- What time?
- 10:00 p.m.

850
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,230
- Where?
- Anywhere.

851
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,859
Well, let's get specific, Bob.
I mean, if the guy's still alive,

852
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:13,197
born in California,
October 3rd, 1928, 10:00 p.m.,

853
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,957
<i>he's 67 years, 9 months,
22 days, 14 hours and 12 minutes.</i>

854
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:23,131
If he's born in New York,
he's three hours older, now, isn't he?

855
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,940
How do you do that?

856
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,108
How do you make that pencil move?

857
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,907
Is that a trick pencil?

858
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:52,323
No. I ask it to move.

859
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:57,659
I mean, I could say that I will it, but
that would be more like a command.

860
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,662
This is more like a collaboration,
a partnership.

861
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,830
- Partnership?
- Mmm-hmm.

862
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,416
With a pencil?

863
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:10,504
Well, why not? We're all made up
of the same stuff, aren't we?

864
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,258
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.

865
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:19,767
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right, yeah.

866
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,271
I want to go home.
How the hell can I get home, Bob?

867
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,485
I don't know. Sorry.

868
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,500
Hey.

869
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,514
They say you haven't slept.

870
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,974
Who's that? My keepers? I'm all right.

871
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,140
You know, you're a pretty gifted man,
Mr. Malley.

872
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,984
No, no, really.

873
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,155
We were hoping...
Well, I was kind of hoping

874
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,654
that you might find
something that you enjoy doing,

875
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,327
something useful in our world.

876
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,300
- Your world?
- Intelligence.

877
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,162
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

878
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:26,337
It's home for me, Jack.
I'm jumping out of my skin here.

879
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,916
I mean, I want my life. I want my life.

880
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,338
What do you want?

881
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,950
- It's not what I want.
- What do they want?

882
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,435
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.

883
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,107
Well, why would they?

884
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:50,358
They're having me break codes all
night, secret codes. I mean, they're...

885
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:53,440
I shouldn't be listening to a code
from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

886
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,111
I mean, these are our allies.

887
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,863
If you guys are gonna accuse me
of a crime or keep me here,

888
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,697
I'll tell the press.

889
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,203
Or I'll call London or Riyadh.

890
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,626
I know all the capitals now, by the way.
You can test me.

891
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,465
My interest in Mr. Malley has to do
with seismology and geology.

892
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,805
It has nothing to do
with security issues.

893
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,473
I know, but that's not the point.

894
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,551
Mr. Malley has been
released without charges,

895
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,807
but he is considered a security risk.

896
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:27,899
Look, I'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

897
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,568
We'd feel better, for the time being,

898
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,896
if he wasn't granted any access
to the institutions

899
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,573
where sensitive government projects
are in the works.

900
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,150
Access?

901
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,323
Access even to personnel.

902
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,459
Lace, it's me.

903
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:57,845
- Hi.
- Hi.

904
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,181
I'm sorry I didn't come
through the front door,

905
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,599
but I was so afraid I'd wake the kids.

906
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,927
That's okay, that's okay.

907
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,184
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I wanted to see you.

908
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:10,691
Nate told me about the FBI.

909
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,189
I'm so glad they let you go.

910
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,611
Yeah, well, they had no choice.

911
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,690
But they are watching me so closely.

912
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,279
I think I scare them.

913
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,280
You scare me, too.

914
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,400
I do?

915
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,831
Hmm...

916
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:38,633
Listen, George,
it's getting really complicated. I just...

917
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,715
I just don't know
what's gonna happen next.

918
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,226
I should probably leave you alone,
shouldn't I?

919
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,528
I guess so.

920
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:08,408
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

921
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:25,887
Hey.

922
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,895
- You want a beer, George?
- Yep.

923
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:35,857
Look, Nate, I am really sorry
for what happened, okay?

924
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:39,606
I told them everything, George.

925
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,244
I told them everything about you,
everything.

926
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,369
Well, you know, that's supposed to
happen, okay? I mean, you know, it's...

927
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:52,623
You just think you're not gonna be
so scared, and you're sitting there,

928
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,211
you don't know what's gonna happen,

929
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:57,962
and then all of a sudden
something happens inside you, right?

930
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,500
And you don't know what it is but...

931
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,500
It's all right.
It was my game, you know?

932
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,630
What'd they do to you, George?

933
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,724
They tested me.

934
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,148
What did they find Out?

935
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:21,906
I'm pregnant.

936
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,151
- That's how it feels.
- How what feels?

937
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,576
Yeah, you know, to be full of ideas
and you can't deliver, okay?

938
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,407
I mean, you know, you're ready
to break out, and you can't deliver.

939
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,242
You know, this professor,
he won't even talk to me.

940
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,454
He won't even talk to me.

941
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,870
You're not going to Berkeley, George?

942
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:40,417
Come on, me at Berkeley.
That's a thought, huh?

943
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,930
I'm sorry, buddy.

944
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,762
You mean inventions?
You got inventions?

945
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,260
No, no, ideas, okay?
I got 1,000 ideas a day,

946
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,263
every damn minute. Okay?

947
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:53,597
I got big "holy cow" kind of ideas
and little "what if' ideas, all right?

948
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,353
Hey, I got ideas for you, Jimmy.
Look at this. Look at this.

949
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,184
Your parking lot,
it's laid out all wrong, okay?

950
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:01,279
Now, if you just follow this, right,
you can put six more cars in,

951
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,106
and nobody gets fender benders,
all right?

952
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,191
Where's Paulette? Where is she?

953
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,865
Bonnie. Here, take this.
This is a new route for her mail, okay?

954
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,946
Now, if she does this,
she can save an hour a day

955
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,623
and everybody gets their mail by 3:00.
Imagine, 3:00.

956
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,420
And I got a "holy shit" idea, too.
Look at this.

957
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:19,420
Now this may be the most efficient way
to store solar energy, okay? Take it.

958
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,210
Well, what am I going to do with it?

959
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,508
What the hell am I supposed
to do with it, huh?

960
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,715
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?

961
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:26,303
- Tell us.
- I'm gonna tell you what it was.

962
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,222
- Well, tell us.
- It was a damn alien.

963
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,549
Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.

964
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:31,305
- I know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was.

965
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:32,556
- Don't say that!
- Well, tell us!

966
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,645
It's a goddamn mistake, is what it is!

967
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,893
Okay? It was supposed to happen
to someone smart,

968
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,813
someone that's scientific,
someone who's a leader.

969
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,395
But it didn't. It happened to me
George freaking Malley!

970
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,821
Look at him! Now, look at him! Look!

971
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:52,746
Jimmy?

972
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,701
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

973
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,914
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's all right.

974
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:03,587
- I'll pay for it.
- All right.

975
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,759
Bonnie, Bonnie, please, it's okay.

976
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,580
Oh, man.

977
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,197
Mmm-hmm.

978
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,866
Okay.

979
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,690
Who was that? A customer?

980
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:36,366
It's Banes.
Says he can't work here no more.

981
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:37,621
Sorry.

982
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:41,121
Well, why didn't he talk to me?

983
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,295
Little bit scared, I guess.

984
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,126
- Jesus Christ.
- Look, George, it'll wear off.

985
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:49,520
They'll forget.
Their cars are gonna break down...

986
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,300
Hi.

987
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,972
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi.

988
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,557
- Energy vibrations? What is it?
- I don't know.

989
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,309
Telekinesis? What? What?

990
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,857
- Yeah, maybe, maybe, yeah.
- You think it's getting out of hand?

991
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,692
Well, look, you know,
I was mad, all right'?

992
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:05,903
I was pissed off.
And I'm not mad now, okay?

993
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:10,324
Good. I'll sound the all clear,
call off the paratroopers.

994
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:14,158
Jesus, George.
Now, listen, you owe me a CAT scan.

995
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,246
- I want more blood.
- Mmm-hmm.

996
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,950
Also, you look like hell.

997
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:21,832
That's good.
Doc, what's the matter with everybody?

998
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,205
They won't give me a chance
to explain anything. I look at...

999
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,800
I look at them, and they look at me
like I'm a green bug or something.

1000
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,128
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look, I have an idea.

1001
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:33,556
Now, you look at this. Now, look at this.
Look at that.

1002
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,766
I'm a big deal at the Harmon Library.

1003
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,684
I can take up to 30 books
a night, okay'?

1004
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:40,646
And I told them I'd be part of this.
I said that I'd put out a table...

1005
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:41,893
- Pressure's way up now.
- ...and I'd sit there,

1006
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,563
and people could ask me questions.
You know, meet George Malley.

1007
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,811
- What do you think?
- Like a circus attraction.

1008
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:49,443
- Oh, God, Doc, please?
- Yeah.

1009
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:52,901
You know, see,
I could explain to them once and for all.

1010
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,618
I could share my ideas with them.

1011
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,912
You know, and then I could get
my life back together.

1012
01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:00,374
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt. Okay?

1013
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:04,792
And do like I told you all your life.
Breathe in and out. Okay, George?

1014
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,420
Yeah.

1015
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,129
- Come on, give it.
- No.

1016
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,131
- Give it. Come on!
- No!

1017
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,910
- You're not careful. You'll break it.
- AI!

1018
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,845
- Please, I just wanna look at it.
- What've you got there?

1019
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:47,724
- Hey, that's dangerous, sweetie.
- He bought it.

1020
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:48,978
What?

1021
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:51,401
It's a piece of the mirror George broke.

1022
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,899
Richard Smick is
selling them at school.

1023
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,276
- Oh, you're kidding.
- It's hot. Feel it.

1024
01:18:55,356 --> 01:18:57,199
It's not hot.

1025
01:18:57,316 --> 01:19:00,490
Richard said the aliens probably
took George Malley away

1026
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:03,865
- and put this man in his place.
- This man?

1027
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,832
Like he's not human.

1028
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,462
That's really dumb,
and it's really mean.

1029
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:15,589
Can't they just look in his eyes
and see who he is'? Can't you?

1030
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,468
Do you remember when Daddy left,
how people treated us differently,

1031
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:21,799
even our so-called friends?

1032
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:27,729
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.

1033
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,310
How much you pay for that?

1034
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,612
- A quarter.
- $1.

1035
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,109
What's the truth, Al?

1036
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,818
I paid $1.
I was gonna check it with my magnets.

1037
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:42,700
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1038
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,697
Do you see something
really strange in there?

1039
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,540
- What?
- What?

1040
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,576
A sucker.

1041
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:51,795
No.

1042
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,430
- You paid $1 for nothing.
- You're a goner.

1043
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:55,711
Nice job, AI.

1044
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:24,866
Lace.

1045
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:27,956
Hi.

1046
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:34,126
Hi. I just called you.

1047
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,890
- You did?
- Mmm.

1048
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,425
Come in. Come in.

1049
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:47,306
I'm so, so glad you came.

1050
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,269
Well, I was just...

1051
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,481
Why were you calling?

1052
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,477
I found some things out, Lace.

1053
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,980
Things are coming clearer to me.

1054
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:01,698
I mean, at least, they're starting to.

1055
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,572
- Things?
- Mmm.

1056
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,950
I wanna talk to the people, Lace.

1057
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:10,496
I don't want them
to be scared of me or frightened.

1058
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,415
I mean, I wanna tell them what I know.

1059
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:17,965
So I've decided to speak
at the library fair.

1060
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:22,257
Do you think that they'll listen to me?

1061
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,757
What would they do,
throw stones?

1062
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,889
Oh, my God. Please sit down.
I can't believe this.

1063
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:35,565
Would you like something to drink?
A beer?

1064
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,985
- No.
- What? What can I get you?

1065
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,531
Scissors.

1066
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,972
- Have you done this before?
- Nope.

1067
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:35,264
Hmm.

1068
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,233
- Up or down?
- Down.

1069
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,196
Is it close enough?

1070
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,525
You tell me.

1071
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,996
It's pretty close.

1072
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,853
You're running away?

1073
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,647
Are you coming back?

1074
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,240
Hmm.

1075
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:18,330
Hope so.

1076
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,493
Oh, hi, Doc. Welcome.

1077
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:03,121
Did you improve your mind
with all this reading?

1078
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:05,206
Yes, Doc.

1079
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,871
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

1080
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,216
Yeah, well...

1081
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:13,900
All right, well, you know,
that's kind of a...

1082
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,508
That's kind of a code book for anyone

1083
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,181
who wants to understand
a woman's heart and mind.

1084
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:19,974
I read it twice.

1085
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:22,345
Can you...

1086
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:25,897
Can you name the presidents forwards
and backwards for these people?

1087
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:29,476
No, but I can name some forward
presidents and some backward ones

1088
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,280
You know, I can really only tell you
what I've read in these books...

1089
01:26:34,398 --> 01:26:35,445
He looks better.

1090
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:39,115
- ...And things I'm thinking about.
- Yeah. Yeah, he does.

1091
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,800
I seem to have an increased capacity
for learning right now.

1092
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:45,125
How do we know
you've read all these books?

1093
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,748
Well, ask me something.

1094
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:50,627
I'll be glad to answer
any question that you have, or a...

1095
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:55,344
How did you break that mirror, George,
without even touching it?

1096
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,804
Now, I wanna talk to you
about that, Banes,

1097
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:01,642
because I know you've been
worried about it, and...

1098
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:05,558
Okay, come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely. I'm gonna...

1099
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,639
May I use your glasses?

1100
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:12,732
What you're about to see is not a trick.
Okay? It's just...

1101
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,439
Well, let's call it
an experiment in energy.

1102
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:17,240
Cool.

1103
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,571
- Well, everything there is...
- Are you getting this?

1104
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,199
...Is made up of
some living energy, okay?

1105
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:24,118
See, now, all this is, is kind of a dance

1106
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:27,792
or a partnership between
the energy coming from me

1107
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,462
and the energy of the plastic.

1108
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:33,666
- Now, that's it. See?
- Well, why can't we do it?

1109
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:38,136
Well, focus, clarity of thought.
I don't know.

1110
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,633
Maybe you can, Banes.

1111
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:41,681
What about the UFOs? What are they?

1112
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,175
I don't know that, either.

1113
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,769
Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1114
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:49,690
Um, this power began the night
that you saw the object in the sky?

1115
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:53,151
That was a light. Now, now,
let me just finish this one thing.

1116
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,979
Now, now,
we're talking about a partnership.

1117
01:27:56,620 --> 01:28:00,659
Now, do you know what the largest
living organism in the world is'?

1118
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:05,114
Okay, it's a grove of aspen trees
in Colorado, acres of aspens.

1119
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:07,700
Okay, now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate,

1120
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,497
but indeed they found out
that they weren't,

1121
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:13,171
that there was one giant organism
with the same root system.

1122
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:15,374
What sort of light was it?

1123
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,464
- Now, that's not unlike us.
- Answer the question!

1124
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:20,762
Why won't you tell us
what you know about the UFOs?

1125
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:22,472
- Are you sure it wasn't aliens?
- Can you move the table?

1126
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:23,890
How did you feel
when you saw that light?

1127
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,680
I think you know more
than you're telling us!

1128
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,477
- Now, imagine if you will...
- What'd the aliens look like?

1129
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,930
Have you seen the light
since the 28th?

1130
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:32,478
- We decided to be a partnership...
- Are you hiding something?

1131
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:35,481
- Say, come on!
- Just put your hands on my boy.

1132
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,358
- It was aliens!
- Move the glasses some more.

1133
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:38,529
Can you bend spoons?

1134
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,778
- Now, we know what you can do.
- Hey, leave George alone!

1135
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,151
Why won't you touch the boy?

1136
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,453
Please? He's dying. Just do it.

1137
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:47,720
George! No!

1138
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,588
George. George,
can you see me, buddy?

1139
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:59,755
George. George, you okay?

1140
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:17,269
Mr. Malley? Are you all right?

1141
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:48,805
Good to see you.

1142
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,976
- You look sorrowful.
- No.

1143
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:59,857
What's the matter? Can't think of
any more tests to give me?

1144
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:03,482
How did you manage to get
your pressure to come down?

1145
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,447
Oh, I found my pace.

1146
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:10,907
Simple thing really. Hard to explain.

1147
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,741
Why, you figure I'm too thick?

1148
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:16,499
What I figure about you is
that you're stalling.

1149
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,542
I'm not stalling though. I'm waiting.

1150
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:25,345
- For what?
- Reinforcements.

1151
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:36,306
Well, you pick good people.

1152
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,250
You bet.

1153
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:44,485
See...

1154
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:48,340
George, George.

1155
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:55,243
There's a tumor in your brain
that's spread out like a hand.

1156
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,957
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.

1157
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,290
But instead of dysfunction...
Now here's the mystery, George.

1158
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:04,172
Instead of destroying brain function,

1159
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,712
so far, it's been stimulating it.

1160
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,965
And we can't understand that.

1161
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:15,145
You have more area of active brain use
than anybody ever tested. Ever.

1162
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,222
Because of those tentacles.

1163
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,190
I mean, we've seen
tumors like this before.

1164
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:21,484
It's called astrocytomas,

1165
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:28,534
and it explains the dizziness
and the illusion of light.

1166
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:33,576
But the way it's in there,
waking up areas of the brain,

1167
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:38,749
it's a big mystery.

1168
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:40,961
So...

1169
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,794
And it's killing me.

1170
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,633
- Well...
- For sure?

1171
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:51,677
We got a call from
the best brain man in the country.

1172
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:54,384
I mean, actually,
he's one of the best in the world.

1173
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,970
He's gonna study your tests
and then talk to you.

1174
01:31:57,950 --> 01:31:58,221
Hmm.

1175
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:59,556
But...

1176
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,934
The blood flow is in danger now,

1177
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:08,782
and you're gonna start to weaken,
maybe black out.

1178
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,823
We really don't know. It's...

1179
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:16,289
But it's a damn lousy scenario,
you see'?

1180
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,455
Let me sit down here a minute.

1181
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,136
God damn it!

1182
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:34,637
Something happened
about 25 years ago

1183
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,386
when you broke your leg
and I set it, George.

1184
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:40,222
I don't know what to call it,

1185
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:43,479
but somehow you got into my heart
more than most.

1186
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:46,645
And for...

1187
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,992
And for a man
who's never been a father,

1188
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:55,658
I sure feel like I'm losing a son.

1189
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:57,993
Yeah.

1190
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,996
Georgie. Yeah.

1191
01:33:10,293 --> 01:33:13,888
Can I do something for you, George?
Anything?

1192
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,131
Yes.

1193
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,511
Next spring,
when you plant the south 40,

1194
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,972
I want you to use the new fertilizer.

1195
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:24,604
I want you to put corn in that field,
and I know what you're thinking.

1196
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:28,232
You're thinking that it's
just too tough a crop. But it's not.

1197
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:32,654
I'm telling you, you'll get
four to five years without rotation.

1198
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:35,736
- Now, trust me on this.
- Hey.

1199
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:42,709
- I'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.

1200
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:48,253
- Doc, you wanna come with?
- Yeah. Okay.

1201
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,551
Bye, Doc.

1202
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:05,610
Now, he didn't say how long.

1203
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,696
Days or weeks.

1204
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:15,320
They don't... They don't know.

1205
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,951
I'm so sorry, Lace.

1206
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,624
I know how you hate surprises.

1207
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,290
I tried so hard not to love you.

1208
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:28,755
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.

1209
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:36,763
Hey, would you love me
the rest of my life'?

1210
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:41,260
No. I'm gonna love you
for the rest of mine.

1211
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:09,667
George Malley? I'm Dr. Wellin.

1212
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,380
George, I'm recording this
because I'm going to be asking you

1213
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:18,430
some very important questions.
You ready?

1214
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,466
- Not another test.
- No.

1215
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:25,895
No, no. No more tests. A dialog.

1216
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:29,145
I'm going to ask for your permission

1217
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:32,649
for my team to perform
open-brain surgery.

1218
01:35:32,769 --> 01:35:36,740
But I don't want you to answer
till we've had our dialog, all right?

1219
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:39,158
But you said that this tumor
was inoperable.

1220
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:43,663
I think the odds are very small,
say, 1 in 500,

1221
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,657
that we'd be able to remove
enough of the tumor

1222
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:48,251
- to even prolong your life.
- Well, why...

1223
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,420
But what I want to explain is

1224
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,999
that this would not be
a life-saving operation.

1225
01:35:54,958 --> 01:36:00,260
This would be... Call it an expedition.

1226
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,927
This would be a voyage of discovery.

1227
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,684
You're in a position
to contribute as much to our knowledge

1228
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:11,979
as any man or woman
who's come before you.

1229
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:17,439
And if you were to wait
and do this operation

1230
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:20,250
after I'm done with my brain,
what would...

1231
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:22,777
If that's what you want, yes,
an autopsy,

1232
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,704
- that's all we'll do.
- But it wouldn't be as useful.

1233
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:30,430
The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

1234
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,380
All right, so if you were to do this
operation, wouldn't it most likely kill me

1235
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:35,130
or at least shorten my life?

1236
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:39,461
George, I'm asking you to try
and see the larger picture...

1237
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:40,841
Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,302
...To realize what you have to offer to us,

1239
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:46,225
the ones you're leaving behind.

1240
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:50,630
You could be
our greatest teacher, George, hmm?

1241
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:54,560
I can be your biographer, in a sense.

1242
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,988
- I can present you to the world.
- But that's not me.

1243
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:02,488
That's just my brain.
Do you understand?

1244
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:05,320
Look, Doctor, you know,
I might just have something to say

1245
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:08,828
in my last few hours.
I just might have something to say.

1246
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,750
What you're saying is that
I have something to teach.

1247
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:15,247
And yet you're willing to end me
to study my brain under a microscope.

1248
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:16,918
Now, is that all I'm here for?

1249
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,591
What else? You're not a scholar or a...

1250
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,340
I'll tell you what I am, okay?
I'll tell you what I think I am.

1251
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:23,120
I think I'm what everybody can be.

1252
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:24,930
Everyone with a malignant, tentacled...

1253
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,352
No, no, no. No, no, it's...
That just helped me get here, okay?

1254
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:34,228
I mean, anybody can get here.
It's... I'm the possibility, all right?

1255
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:38,862
I mean, I think you've got this
desperate grasp on technology

1256
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:40,108
and this grasp on science,

1257
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:43,112
and you don't have a hand left
to grasp what's important.

1258
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,864
- George. Now, George...
- If had to chose between a tumor

1259
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:47,786
that got me here and some flash
of light from an alien craft,

1260
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:50,953
I'd choose the tumor, I would,
because it's here within us.

1261
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:53,626
What I'm talking about
is the human spirit.

1262
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,874
That's the challenge.
That's the voyage.

1263
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:57,921
That's the expedition.

1264
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:07,971
You need to go now. I need my rest,
and I wanna go home.

1265
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:31,827
Hey, hey, hey. I tried to release
my patient. Now, what's going on?

1266
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:32,998
- It's done.
- What's done?

1267
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:35,995
We didn't feel George Malley
was competent to make the decision.

1268
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:37,917
He's a surgical patient now.

1269
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:40,589
What did you tell the judge?
That you could save him'?

1270
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:44,260
- I might prolong his life, yes.
- Bullshit.

1271
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:47,339
If he were rational, he'd say yes.
You know he would.

1272
01:38:47,964 --> 01:38:50,968
Now I know why you guys wear masks.

1273
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:57,181
<i>Yeah, if it was light enough,</i>

1274
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,523
<i>he could've been blowing on it
with his breath.</i>

1275
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:03,154
He could've had a string,
so thin, you know, like catgut.

1276
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:05,861
And he could've had it on his finger
and on the glasses,

1277
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,359
and he could've made it move that way.

1278
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,115
Don't you think he could've

1279
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:11,696
thrown something
at that mirror somehow?

1280
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:13,789
- We just didn't see it.
- No way.

1281
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:15,993
That quake could've been
a coincidence.

1282
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:17,952
He just thought he knew stuff.

1283
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:20,629
I mean, he just studied harder
on the Spanish, that's all.

1284
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,548
It's not like he really knew stuff.

1285
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,467
Just studied hard at chess
and made us think he was changing,

1286
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:28,547
but, you know,
he never really changed at all.

1287
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,302
Isn't that right, Doc?

1288
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:34,181
I mean, he never really got
any smarter. Doc?

1289
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:37,620
Banes.

1290
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,610
How's your lady love?

1291
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:44,900
We broke up.

1292
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:48,742
Really'? That's too bad, yeah.

1293
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:52,237
Now, George, he's got a love at
his side, and she's sticking with him.

1294
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:56,241
You know why?
Because he bought her chairs.

1295
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:58,372
That's pretty smart to me.

1296
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,750
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?

1297
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:05,400
God, Doc's really drunk tonight.

1298
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:06,584
Every woman has her chairs,

1299
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,713
something she needs to
put herself into, Banes.

1300
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,388
You ever figure out
what Lisa's chairs were, and buy them?

1301
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,580
Nope.

1302
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,608
But you're right about one thing.
George never changed.

1303
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,693
Never. No, never.

1304
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:31,451
Doc's making no sense tonight.

1305
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:34,750
Yeah. Maybe he caught it from George.

1306
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,624
- Now, God damn it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?

1307
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,293
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?

1308
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:44,873
He wasn't selling anything.
He didn't want anything from anybody!

1309
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:49,803
He wanted nothing from nobody!
Nothing! Nothing!

1310
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:56,389
And you people have to tear him down,
so you can sleep better tonight?

1311
01:40:56,467 --> 01:41:00,722
So you can prove that the world is flat,
and sleep better tonight? Am I right?

1312
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,819
I'm right.

1313
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:18,657
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.

1314
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:33,297
Hey, George. How you doing?
Here you go. Drink up.

1315
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,552
All right.

1316
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:39,310
Good job.

1317
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:43,630
Don't take the pudding.
That's the good part.

1318
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,893
- Hey, is Cal around?
- Sure. Do you wanna see him?

1319
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,320
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

1320
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,348
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, man.

1321
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:18,845
- How's it going?
- All right.

1322
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:21,302
- Can you stay for a few minutes?
- Sure.

1323
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:23,183
Saved you some pudding again.

1324
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:26,687
What a buddy. I love this stuff.

1325
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:33,564
Night, dude.

1326
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:51,541
- Hey, Doc, you seen him?
- Seen who? What?

1327
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:52,876
George Malley. He's out.
He sneaked out.

1328
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:54,710
We're looking all over for him.

1329
01:42:55,544 --> 01:42:57,120
- He's out?
- Yeah, he flew the coop.

1330
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,216
Nobody knows where he is.
I heard it on the radio.

1331
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:00,925
Flew the coop. Those FBI guys

1332
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,931
are going to have me
driving around all night.

1333
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,934
I'm gonna be home late again.
My wife is gonna kill me.

1334
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:15,903
I want you to take these
and give them to Doc.

1335
01:43:15,981 --> 01:43:18,951
These I'm taking with me,
because I haven't finished them yet.

1336
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,154
They're for Dr. Ringold.

1337
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:27,202
This I wrote for you, Nate. It's about
soils, and some of my own thoughts.

1338
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:28,999
- Your thoughts?
- Yeah.

1339
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:35,510
- I could drive you.
- No. No, Nate, it's too chancy.

1340
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:39,597
- You can make it. Yeah.
- Nate.

1341
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:33,397
- I'll get it.
- Then you put the top on.

1342
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:43,194
- Leave me alone.
- I didn't do it, Al

1343
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:51,919
Is that tight enough?
Why don't you do it once more?

1344
01:44:54,747 --> 01:44:56,715
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1345
01:45:02,922 --> 01:45:04,219
There you go.

1346
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:06,221
Good. Now you've fixed it.

1347
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:13,561
What?

1348
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,660
You came here to die, didn't you?

1349
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:28,782
But I like this place,
and I love the people here.

1350
01:45:56,392 --> 01:46:00,943
You know,
if we were to put this apple down

1351
01:46:02,147 --> 01:46:07,280
and leave it, it would be spoiled
and gone within a few days.

1352
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:11,658
But if we were to take a bite of it,
like this,

1353
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:18,470
it would become part of us,
and we could take it with us forever.

1354
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:44,866
Al, everything is on its way
to somewhere.

1355
01:46:46,442 --> 01:46:47,659
Everything.

1356
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:10,132
That's a good bite.

1357
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:34,369
Keep an eye out.

1358
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,756
Have you seen George Malley,
Ms Pennamin?

1359
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,460
What's the point?

1360
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:53,471
Look, it's not my call.

1361
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:56,974
I haven't seen him.

1362
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:20,544
- You mind if I get in your truck?
- Why?

1363
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:37,311
What's your first name?

1364
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:43,650
- Jack.
- How would you want to die, Jack?

1365
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:56,826
Come on, let's go.

1366
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:14,924
There you are.

1367
01:49:18,135 --> 01:49:20,354
I knew I'd find you here.

1368
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:23,812
What are you working on?

1369
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:28,191
Dr. Ringold's coming tomorrow,
and I just wanted to finish this up.

1370
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:32,362
- Finish what?
- Just some possibilities.

1371
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:37,300
Hey, come sit by me.

1372
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:40,360
Hmm?

1373
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:44,336
- You scared?
- No.

1374
01:49:46,497 --> 01:49:49,876
- I wish I knew what you feel.
- Oh, you do.

1375
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:54,764
You've always known it, Lace.
I'll show you.

1376
01:49:55,839 --> 01:49:59,139
When your children were babies,
how did you hold them?

1377
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:07,902
And if they had a hard time sleeping
and you had to rock them to sleep,

1378
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:09,603
well, how did you do it?

1379
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:33,440
See?

1380
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,592
Hey, look what I made back there.

1381
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,433
That looks like a bed.

1382
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:47,399
Are you expecting to get lucky?

1383
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:50,478
No. Just hoping.

1384
01:52:23,695 --> 01:52:26,118
Hey, I've never kissed you there.

1385
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:28,792
- No. Keeping track?
- Mmm-hmm.

1386
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:37,920
You going to sleep?

1387
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:39,940
Mmm-mmm.

1388
01:52:39,836 --> 01:52:41,634
- Are you?
- No.

1389
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:45,513
I don't want to sleep
unless you're sleeping.

1390
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:47,560
I don't want to...

1391
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,690
- Lace.
- What?

1392
01:52:56,645 --> 01:52:58,693
- Sweetheart.
- What?

1393
01:53:03,402 --> 01:53:06,997
- Now, you have to listen to me, now.
- What?

1394
01:53:12,327 --> 01:53:14,830
- It's happening.
- No.

1395
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:16,500
Mmm-hmm.

1396
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:18,834
No. Wait, George, wait.

1397
01:53:20,794 --> 01:53:23,422
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.

1398
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:30,388
- George.
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

1399
01:53:32,556 --> 01:53:33,773
Okay.

1400
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:38,482
Goodbye, honey.

1401
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:41,189
No.

1402
01:54:26,777 --> 01:54:30,452
Hello, I'm John Ringold.
I'm here to see George Malley.

1403
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:37,121
Oh. I'm sorry, John.
George Malley passed away last night.

1404
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:44,520
Well, I'm sorry.

1405
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:52,310
He left these for you.

1406
01:54:56,890 --> 01:55:01,316
He said they're not finished.
You'll have to do it.

1407
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:07,784
I'll do my best.

1408
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:12,456
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1409
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:17,919
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1410
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,424
Thank you, sweetie.

1411
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:40,346
- Nate, they'll be waiting for you.
- We're coming. We're coming.

1412
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:10,917
Beautiful.

1413
01:58:15,213 --> 01:58:16,339
Oh.

1414
01:58:18,592 --> 01:58:21,391
It's okay. It's okay.

1415
01:58:23,805 --> 01:58:25,227
Hey, Nate.

1416
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:30,604
What am I gonna do
with the drinks, though?

1417
01:58:30,687 --> 01:58:32,234
What am I gonna do?

1418
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:47,167
It's not here. I'll tell you where it is.
It's right there!

1419
01:58:47,245 --> 01:58:50,169
- How'd you do that?
- How'd I do that? It's magic.

1420
01:58:51,374 --> 01:58:54,200
Can you hear her? She just kicked...

1421
01:58:55,712 --> 01:58:57,931
- Have a cold one.
- Thank you.

1422
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,680
- You getting any rest?
- Not much.

1423
01:59:00,759 --> 01:59:05,356
Well, get it now, because there's
no sleeping once the baby gets there.

1424
01:59:06,306 --> 01:59:07,558
Check.

1425
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:16,693
Go on now. Think it through.
Think it through.
