1
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,129
Is heaven a hope?

2
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,169
Or as real as the earth and sky?

3
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,323
I once asked my grandfather
that question.

4
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,279
And he said by the time
he knew the answer

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,847
it would be too late
for him to tell me.

6
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,364
The day would come when I
asked that question again,

7
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,647
staring into the eyes of my son.

8
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,159
Mighty quick.

9
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,719
I don't get paid by the hour.

10
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,159
I'm afraid you don't
get paid by cash, either.

11
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,519
Are you sure you're
okay with the carpet?

12
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,719
Times are tough.

13
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,730
Your business improves,
mine will, too.

14
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,439
Why don't you grab a hose?

15
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,039
Did you rob a carpet store, Todd?

16
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,719
Unlike you guys,
I actually have a job.

17
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,119
Look at these bums.

18
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,085
And he's got five of them.
Do you want some help?

19
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,719
You know, if you keep accepting
things instead of money,

20
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,319
eventually, you're going to
run out of things and money.

21
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,126
Yeah, I have to downsize, man.
Downsize.

22
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,559
You ladies just keep your seats.
Todd and I got this.

23
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,959
Yeah, don't help. Not necessary.

24
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,321

Well, this morning
I want to talk to you

146
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,808
about what sort of
commitment makes a marriage,

147
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,006
makes a relationship,
makes up a life.

148
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,451
Last night,

149
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,159
I stood in the bedroom
where our children sleep

150
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,719
and I listened to their mother
read them a bedtime story.

151
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,159
And in the final saga
of this wonderful land

152
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,119
where animals talk with humans

153
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,479
and a great lion
leads them all to love

154
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,889
and faith and courage.

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,319
In the last chapter
of this great story,

156
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,729
written for children just like
me and Mrs. Davis over here,

157
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,599
all of the lion's enemies have swept
away his followers except for two,

158
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,280
a bear and a unicorn,

159
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,999
who are trapped in
a cave with the lion.

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,999
And because the entrance
to this cave is narrow,

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,959
the wave after wave of soldiers
that the evil king sends in

162
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,839
to try and kill them can't do it.

163
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,599
The lion, the bear, the
unicorn, they fight them off.

164
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,199
So finally, the king
sends in a messenger.

165
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,119
He says, "Look,
the one that we really want,

166
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,879
"the one we're interested
in, is that lion.

167
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,368
"Give him up and
the rest of you will live.

168
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,959
"Ah, the unicorn, we're
going to cut his horn off.

169
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,399
"We'll make him pull a cart
for the rest of his life.

170
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,719
"The bear, we're going to
put in chains and shackles,

171
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,679
"make him dance in the circus.

172
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,009
"But both of you will live.

173
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,923
"All you have to do
is give up that lion."

174
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,159
Finally, the lion looks at his
friends with that look in his eyes,

175
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,079
"What are you going to do?"

176
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,639
And the bear and the
unicorn, they just smile

177
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,447
and they say, "Of all the
deaths that we could have died,

178
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,602
"this right here is the one
we would have chosen."

179
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,839
But the bear and the
lion and the unicorn,

180
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,239
they weren't looking
for an easy road.

181
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,047
I don't think Jesus was either
when he accepted the cross.

182
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,599
There's a lot of people, they don't
believe that story any more than

183
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,644
the one about the lion,
the bear, and the unicorn.

184
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,119
I'm here with you all this morning

185
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,288
because I believe in them both.

186
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,481
And I'll never give up that lion.

187
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,279
- Rosa.
- Sonja.

188
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,005
- How are you?
- I'm good.

189
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,279
I have something
I wanted to give you.

190
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,759
It's just something small.

191
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,610
Thank you.

192
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,119
Oh, Sonja, this is too beautiful.

193
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,641
No. Not for her.

194
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,799
I'll see you guys next Sunday.

195
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,207
Yeah. Take care.

196
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,399
- Look, baby. Sonja gave it to us for Lucia.
- Wow.

197
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,759
It's gorgeous.

198
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,959
You're great when
I'm there to inspire you.

199
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,079
If you want to inspire me,

200
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,919
you get a hit at that
softball game this afternoon.

201
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,690
Outstanding. I will.

202
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,159
Watch that ball like that.

203
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,359
Embarrassing.

204
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,608
- He's a good batter.
- Embarrassing.

205
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,691
All right, Jay!

206
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,731
Hold up.

207
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,359
Let's go, baby.

208
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,050
Come on, Sonja!

209
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,851
Come on, Mama!

210
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,402
All right! Let's go, Sonja!

211
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,845
Two more!

212
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,368
- Come on, Mama.
- Go!

213
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,926
Go! Go, go, go!

214
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,684
- Out!
- No!

215
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,159
No, he knocked it loose.
He's safe! Safe.

216
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,279
There you go.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,959
You can't do that, man.
That's dirty.

218
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,399
Or what? Is there a problem?

219
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,250
Is there a problem?

220
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,399
I'm all right.

221
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,319
You just got me warmed up, baby.

222
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,559
You got me warmed up now.

223
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,999
Come on, baby.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,044
Yeah, let's go. Easy out.

225
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,408
Yeah, Todd!

226
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,529
- Go Sonja!
- Yes!

227
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,919
Come on, Todd!

228
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,610
Safe. Safe.

229
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,087
Michael, Michael!
It's bad, it's bad!

230
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,279
Hold on, let me look.

231
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,599
Don't move. Get my bag.

232
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,559
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you okay?

233
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,359
Todd, just stay still, buddy.

234
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,719
We have to cut your pants, Todd.

235
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,649
Don't touch it!

236
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,199
- It's a spiral fracture.
- Is it going to heal?

237
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,239
It'll heal, but he won't be
climbing any ladders soon.

238
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,959
Todd, just stay still, buddy.

239
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,323
I'm going to put some
pressure on it, Todd, okay?

240
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,639
Todd, we gotta lift it up, buddy.

241
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,119
We gotta lift it up.

242
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,239
As many of you already know,

243
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,841
I was hurt sliding into third.

244
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,239
I was safe.

245
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,479
No, he was out.

246
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,130
Okay, I was out.

247
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,239
I, uh, had a great teacher
early in the ministry

248
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,599
who told me that we'd have
good days and bad days

249
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,770
and we'd seldom know at
the time which is which.

250
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
But a few Sundays ago,

251
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,681
as I was sliding into third and
I heard the crack of my leg,

252
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,239
I had a pretty good idea
which was which.

253
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,127
So, the Bible talks about adversity.
The Bible talks about, uh,

254
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,726
all things working
together for the good.

255
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,290
Todd! What...

256
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,644
Okay, I'm all right.

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,159
- It's my back.
- Are you all right?

258
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,041
Don't move.

259
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,804
- Lie down.
- I'm on it.

260
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,039
It's Pastor Todd. He's fallen.

261
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,322
Nancy, sing Amazing Grace.

262
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,359
Don't move, don't move.

263
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,289
It's just a spasm.

264
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,879

All we can do is
give you painkillers

271
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,399
and lots of water
and let you pass them.

272
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,762
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

273
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,079
You're going to be all right.

274
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,039
- Jay!
- Hey.

275
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Todd's passing another stone, so
Colton and I, we're going to the park.

276
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,239
All right.

277
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,399
Giddyup, horsey!

278
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,199
Oh, horseys bite.
Did I tell you that?

279
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,129
How's he doing?

280
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,999
Todd?

281
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,399
Todd?

282
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,359
I'm passing another one!

283
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,563
Todd, it's Jay!

284
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,959
How are you doing, buddy?

285
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,130
Can I do anything for you?

286
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,119
What, do you want to
try and catch it?

287
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,687
No. That's not what I had in mind.

288
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,759
Uh, how many have you passed?

289
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,719
I've passed seven, Jay! Seven!

290
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,639
Oh, that's a bunch.

291
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,319
I think they usually say
you gotta pass about 14,

292
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,799
15 to make sure they're gone.

293
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,919
What do you want?

294
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,279
Well, uh, you know,
we're sort of wondering

295
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,799
when you think you might
be able to preach again.

296
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,399
Okay, thank you.

297
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,639
From the prison ministry.

298
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,639
Giving is a good...

Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit.

301
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,839
She's from the seminary.

302
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,886
If Todd isn't back soon,
I'm going to kill somebody.

303
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,519
And I'm going to start with you.

308
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,891
I know a great place. Denver.

309
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,199
- Denver?
- Mmm-hmm.

310
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,767
We can bring the kids,
go for a weekend.

312
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,004
I don't know. Soon.

313
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,999
No, honey. I have to focus on work.

314
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,319
We need it.

315
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,559
We've got to get some bills paid.

There's no way, I'm telling you.

319
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,245
Okay. I'm just saying, if you did,

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,406
Yeah.

358
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,639
I did it, I did it!

359
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,410
You sure did.

360
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,199
I want a sticker.

361
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,039
If you want a sticker, you have
to get in there and hold Rosie.

362
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,159
Colton, why don't you try?

363
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,771
No.

364
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,039
Hello, Doctor, it's Sonja Burpo.

365
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,479
Colton started throwing up
on the way home in the car.

366
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,719
Cassie!

367
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,159
No, I don't.

368
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,170
Cassie. Oh, Cassie. Honey. Oh.

369
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,559
Yeah.

370
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,799
Todd!

371
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,319
I'm coming, I'm coming.

372
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,879
- Oh, oh!
- His temperature is 103.

373
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,239
Oh, keep it in there.

374
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,399
And Cassie is throwing up now also.

375
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,519
Oh, don't get any in your hair.

376
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,879
Don't get any in your hair.

377
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,839
- Honey. Thank you. Thank you.
- Those are chunks.

378
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,519
You've got to chew your food.

379
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,725
The doctor says that, uh, the flu's
been going around and... Todd!

380
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,159
Hey, this is Todd Burpo,

381
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,879
Overhead Garage Door,
Imperial, Nebraska.

382
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,759
That's right. Right.

383
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,884
I got that big order for
the 591 series doors.

384
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,599
B-U-R-P-O. Okay,
I'm sending in that deposit.

385
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,759
I'm going to pay that in full with
the job completion, all right?

386
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,725
Okay, thank you very much.

387
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,805
His fever's up.

388
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,999
I thought it was holding steady.

389
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,239
It was.

390
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,119
It's now 104. It's been
four days. Cassie is fine.

391
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,079
I mean, could it be appendicitis?

392
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,679
You had it in college. I've had it.

393
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,199
Maybe this is the beginning of it.

394
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,079
- I'm going to try to call...
- No, I already tried.

395
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,568
We've got to take him to
the medical center. Now.

396
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,721
All right.

397
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,968
Cassie!

398
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,322
Todd, we need to hurry.

399
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
Faster, Todd.

400
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,999
He has a ruptured appendix.

401
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,079
We need to get him
to surgery right away.

402
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,479
Call the OR.

403
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,799
Daddy, don't let them take me.

404
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,319
I'm right here, buddy.

405
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,599
Ruptured when?

406
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,479
It looks like days ago.
He's very sick.

407
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,639
Dawn, run ahead,
get everybody ready.

408
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,959
But how can that happen?

409
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,519
The blotches on the
X-ray are infected.

410
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,679
It exploded all through
his abdominal cavity.

411
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,919
But he's going to be okay, right?

412
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,011
We're going to get in there and clean
him out. You'll have to wait here.

413
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,006
Stay right there, please.

414
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,410
Are they ready for us in OR?
I need his status ASAP.

415
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,199
I'll come with you.

416
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,243
No, no, I just need a minute.

417
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,291
You've made me suffer.
And I took that.

418
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,291
You made my family suffer
and I took that.

419
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,244
You're going to take my boy?

420
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,490
Don't you take my son.
Don't you take my son!

421
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,119
His blood pressure is falling.

422
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,731
We're losing him.

423
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,240
Sonja.

424
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,970
How's Colton?

425
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,322
We're in trouble here.

426
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,130
He's, um...

427
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,879
He's not... He's not doing well.

428
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,399
He's worse. He's much
worse. And I...

429
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,841
No. No.

430
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,611
Will you call some friends

431
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,807
and ask them to pray for him?

432
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,039
Of course, I will, honey.

433
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,605
Right now.

434
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,008
I'll pray for you, too.

435
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,771
Thank you.

436
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,439
Jay, we've got a problem.

437
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,120
Please help us watch
over this little boy.

438
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,919
He's very precious.

439
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,279
I've heard him say so many times

440
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,369
what a fine young man you are.

441
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,286
I have a favor I'd like to ask.

442
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,491
For our brother,
for his family, for his boy.

443
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,559
Rosa, it's Nancy from the church.

444
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,923
Colton Burpo is in the
hospital and he may not live.

445
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,569
Our Father who art in heaven...

446
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,162
Mr. and Mrs. Burpo.

447
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,569
Colton.

448
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,367
Hi.

449
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,130
Hi, buddy.

450
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,726
Hi.

451
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,446
Dad, I want to hold

452
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,048
that spider.

453
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,281
Wow.

454
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,762
I think it's amazing.

455
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,919
How is it?

456
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,326
Fun.

457
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,159
Now you have to do it.

458
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,319
I'm not going to do it.

459
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,639
- Do it, do it!
- I'm not doing it.

460
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,959
- Do you want a sticker?
- Get the kid a sticker.

461
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,079
Okay.

462
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,009
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

463
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,170
That's fun.

464
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,730
I've been here.

465
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,609
Here? I don't think we've
been here before, pal.

466
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,969
- Guess what.
- What?

467
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,199
I like spiders.

468
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,845
I saw that!

469
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,244
You got a sticker.
You're not afraid anymore.

470
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,242
We don't ever have to be scared.

471
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,959
Is that why you wanted
to come back,

472
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,279
to show me you weren't afraid?

473
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,925
It's important.

474
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,524
What about the hospital?

475
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,999
How do you feel about that?
Does that scare you?

476
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,090
No, that's where
the angels sang to me.

477
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,568
The angels sang to you?

478
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,087
Yes.

479
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,639
When?

480
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,839
During the operation, when Mom was
in one room talking on the phone,

481
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,602
and you were in another
room yelling at God.

482
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,804
How did you know that?

483
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,883
Because I saw you.

484
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,165
When did you see me?

485
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,039
I lifted up and I looked down

486
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,242
and saw the doctor working on me.

487
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,804
And I saw you and Mommy.

488
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,010
You saw...

489
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,479
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,330
A storm's coming.

491
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,679
Are you setting records?

492
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,879
- You got a sticker, huh?
- It's a record.

493
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,127
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

494
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,131
How was the trip?

495
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,319
It was good. Fine.

496
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,639
Just fine?

497
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,759
It was amazing, actually.

498
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,359
Colton held that spider like
he was holding his Spider-Man.

499
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,925
Come on.

500
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,999
Did he ever mention this
idea to you of hearing, uh,

501
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,565
angels singing?

502
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,079
Not unless you're talking about
you and me in the shower.

503
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,559
Todd, these bills,
they are coming through.

504
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,959
How bad?

505
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,605
$23,000.

506
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,799
I mean, do we have any receivables,

507
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,039
anything we can collect at all?

508
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,130
These utilities,
we can put those off.

509
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,839
Now this one,
I have to pay Jack Martin

510
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,879
for those truck tires.
His wife is sick.

511
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,039
We've got a medical bill
coming in as well. $34,000.

512
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,799
- I thought this was part of the $23,000.
- No.

513
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,679
That's just what we owe with medical
supplies, living expenses, taxes.

514
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,039
I'm going to have to get a job.

515
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,239
I don't want to do that.

516
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,439
But you can't work
any harder than you are.

517
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,211
- We need you here.
- You have to pay the doctor.

518
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,479
Of course, honey. We're going to
find some way to take care of that.

519
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,287
We've got to pay him.
He helped me. I saw him.

520
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,119
Is something wrong with Colton?

521
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,599
Why do you say that?

522
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,319
Because sometimes he sounds weird.

523
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,479
He says Jesus has a horse.

524
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,844
Well, all sisters think
their brothers are weird.

525
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,799
That's just the way it goes. Okay?

526
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,411
All right.

527
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,919
Okay, so, your dad's a preacher.
He knows a lot of things,

528
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,283
but he didn't know
that Jesus has a horse.

529
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,165
Didn't know that.

530
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,319
It's beautiful.

531
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,799
Yeah? What color is it?

532
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,599
It's all the colors.

533
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,719
All the colors of the
rainbow are in heaven,

534
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,527
except they're all more.

535
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,959
More what?

536
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,162
Just more and brighter.

537
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,599
How do you know about this horse?

538
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,609
Because I saw him in heaven.

539
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,559
You were in heaven?

540
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,799
Dad, can we talk
about this tomorrow

541
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,359
because I'm getting really sleepy.

542
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,766
Okay.

543
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,285
Dad, can I sleep in
your room tonight?

544
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,319
No. No, we're going to
go ahead and sleep here.

545
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,522
It's late, guys. Come on.

546
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,279
Open the door!

547
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,606
Sorry.

548
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,246
Hmm.

549
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,131
Are you asleep?

550
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,441
Colton just told me
he went to heaven.

551
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,649
What? When?

552
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,611
Just now.

553
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,329
No, when did he go to heaven?

554
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,688
He said that during his
operation, he left his body,

555
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,446
and he looked back on the
operating table and saw himself.

556
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,283
He has a very
beautiful imagination.

557
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,599
I'll do it, too.
I'll have the same thing.

558
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,719
Hi, how are you, Rosa? Can we
get, uh... What do you think?

559
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,839
Milkshake.

560
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,644
Two milkshakes, please.

561
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,923
- How is everything?
- Okay, great.

562
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,650
So, Colton,

563
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,399
I want to ask you about when
the angels sang to you.

564
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,761
Sure.

565
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,001
I was alone, but I wasn't scared.

566
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,324
I was at the church.

567
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,519
The door was closed.

568
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,529
I opened it.

569
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,239
And I saw something wonderful.

570
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,202
♪ Hallelujah

571
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,762
♪ Hallelujah ♪

572
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,362
I saw angels and they
were singing to me.

573
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,251
Can we sing "We Will Rock You"?

574
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,203
Colton, do you know who I am?

575
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,325
You're not afraid?

576
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,687
Nobody here wants to hurt me.

577
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,759
That's right, Colton.

578
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,928
And nobody here ever will.

579
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,205
There are some people here
who want to meet you.

580
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,007
So, what did they sing?

581
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,331
I asked them to sing "We Will
Rock You", but they wouldn't.

582
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,887
And they laughed just like that.

583
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,851
Mmm, milkshake.

584
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,559
Moreland University,
Department of Psychology,

585
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,759
Chairman's office.

586
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,399
May I speak with
Dr. Slater, please?

587
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,879
Are you calling for an appointment?

588
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,448
Yeah. Is there any chance
she could see me today?

589
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,239
- Dr. Slater?
- Yes.

590
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,159
Hi. I'm Todd Burpo.

591
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,681
Oh, yes, please come in.

592
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,246
Thanks for, uh,
seeing me on short notice.

593
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,959
Um, "Burpo." Are you a
minister over in Imperial?

594
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,319
Yeah. Yes. How'd you know that?

595
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,729
Uh, my late husband was religious.
Please, sit.

596
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,559
Uh, he had heard about a speaker
named Burpo who was very interesting

597
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,206
and he kept badgering me
to come hear you.

598
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,766
You're not?

599
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,119
Not what?

600
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,446
Religious.

601
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,486
No. Is that a problem?

602
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,767
No.

603
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,959
No, you might offer me
a harder opinion,

604
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,448
help me find a more rational
understanding for something.

605
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,759
I have a son who's, uh,
extremely smart.

606
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,610
And he's sensitive.

607
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,127
And?

608
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,245
He went to heaven.

609
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,524
And then he came back.

610
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,159
Your son had
a near-death experience?

611
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,759
No, he didn't die.

612
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,611
We checked his surgical reports.

613
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,166
His heart never stopped, his
brain activity never flatlined.

614
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,159
So, why do you say
he went to heaven?

615
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,169
Because he says he did.

616
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,919
At the point near death,

617
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,239
the body releases hormones

618
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,330
that can induce a state
of peace, even bliss.

619
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,399
Our brains fill in the blanks.

620
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,479
Christians see Jesus, Jews see
Moses, Muslims see Muhammad.

621
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,319
Yeah, I read your article,

622
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,799
but my son saw things
that I can't really explain.

623
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,482
He saw me praying. He saw me

624
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,039
shouting at God.

625
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,879
He saw his mother in another
wing calling friends,

626
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,402
asking them to pray for us. All
the while, he was in surgery.

627
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,527
- Reverend Burpo...
- Todd.

628
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,286
Todd.

629
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,959
Is it unusual for your wife to
call friends in a time of crisis?

630
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,959
No. No, it's not.

631
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,119
And is it unusual for you to pray?

632
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,679
Or become passionate when you do?

633
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,248
No. No. Of course not.
But I know my son.

634
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,679
And when he talks about heaven,

635
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,039
it doesn't sound like
something he's making up.

636
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,759
He's very specific. He's four.

637
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,079
And he's extremely smart.

638
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,250
Yes. Both of my kids are.

639
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,846
Reverend...

640
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,119
Todd, I don't mean to
discount whatever magic it is

641
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,839
you derive from all of this,

642
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,279
but there are many explanations,

643
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,482
even for extrasensory knowledge.

644
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,519
Is it really easier
to believe in that

645
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,559
or clairvoyance

646
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,039
or telepathy than it is
life after the physical?

647
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,730
Believe in miracles?

648
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,085
I've found such concepts
to be a bit circular.

649
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,361
Even before I watched
my husband die.

650
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,919
Let me ask you, did you
come here today because

651
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,199
you were wondering about my faith?

652
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,607
Or were you wondering
about your own?

653
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,970
Thanks for your time.

654
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,971
You're welcome.

655
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,599
What if you have
an encounter so far

656
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,169
beyond your own
experience that it's

657
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,000
irrational?

658
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,680
What then?

659
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,439
This looks like trouble here.

660
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,879
- Todd, we're so happy about Colton.
- Thank you.

661
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,527
Thanks. Thank you very much.
See you later. Good.

662
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,599
There he is.

663
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,719
- How are you doing, buddy?
- Good. How are you?

664
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,239
How's that Colton doing today?

665
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,568
Is he back to torturing his sister?

666
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,768
Yes.

667
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,359
I need some advice, smart advice.

668
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,079
Well, I am not smart, so you
came to the right guy.

669
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,199
I know that.

670
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,839
Nothing but clumsy, inaccurate
advice available here.

671
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,088
I've been expecting to
see you a little sooner.

672
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,679
What do you mean?

673
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,530
Well, I'm your banker.

674
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,119
I didn't come here for a loan.

675
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,479
Not the bank's money, just
from a friend to a friend.

676
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,319
Let me help you out, okay?
Nobody would have to know.

677
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,681
I'd know.

678
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,599
I never wanted to be the guy who
stands up there in the pulpit

679
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,399
asking people to give to charity
when all he does is take it.

680
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,959
It's not charity. It's a loan
from a friend to a friend.

681
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,999
I know you need the help.
It's what real people do.

682
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,440
I don't.

683
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,479
Well, then you didn't come
here for smart advice.

684
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,039
I don't think the church has
kept your salary in line with

685
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,559
the new members
that you've brought in.

686
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,439
I think you deserve a raise.

687
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,119
Let me talk to the board,
see what I can do.

688
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,639
I didn't come here
for a raise, either.

689
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,719
All right. Good.

690
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,684
I didn't want to ask them.

691
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,288
What can I do for you?

692
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,286
It's Colton.

693
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,286
He's been talking about this, uh...

694
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,399
We ask these kids
to believe this stuff

695
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,279
and I don't even know
if I believe it myself, Jay.

696
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,839
What?

697
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,479
Colton is what I'm trying
to tell you about.

698
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,079
He's been saying things
I don't understand.

699
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,799
He's talking about these
conversations in heaven.

700
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,439
I used to go out
with a flight attendant

701
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,008
whose son had extensive conversations
with Barney the dinosaur.

702
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,279
- Do you know how irritating Barney is?
- Yeah.

703
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,799
- He's purple.
- Exactly, exactly.

704
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,844
The Bible tells us to
believe his children.

705
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,359
What my child's telling me will
get me laughed out of this town.

706
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,999
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know what to preach.

707
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,519
I don't have anything to say.

708
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,610
Just speak from the heart,
Todd, like you always do.

709
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,239
What about fear do we
struggle with? Is it confusion?

710
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,841
Is it doubt? Is it questions?

711
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,645
I got questions.

712
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,280
We all do. Maybe we
ought to just...

713
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,039
Maybe we ought to try that today.
Just see if, uh...

714
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,083
Do you want to try questions?

715
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,489
- Hey, Todd.
- Yeah?

716
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,759
My family and I
prayed for you a lot.

717
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,849
Thank you. Thank you, Michael.

718
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,527
Uh, we're just wondering,
how bad was it?

719
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,999
"How bad?" It was awful.

720
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,559
I mean, a lot of us heard that
Colton died during the operation

721
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,411
and prayers
brought him back to life.

722
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,922
Uh, no, he didn't die
on the operating table.

723
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,119
He, you know, came mighty close,

724
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,210
but I think it was the doctors,

725
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,519
through God and all of your
prayers, that kept him alive

726
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,166
and so thank you all for that.

727
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,199
So, how did you handle it?

728
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,639
Not well.

729
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,679
But the important thing is that the
Burpos faced a significant challenge

730
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,159
and they came through it. Amen.

731
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,805
Amen.

732
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,439
That's the thing, though.

733
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,201
Thank you for that, Jay, but I don't
know that I did come through.

734
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,399
Colton's experience
makes me wonder.

735
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,639
About what, exactly, Todd?

736
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,765
He's just been telling us about
his experiences, talking

737
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,279
about them.

738
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,119
When he was in, uh, the
operation, Colton visited heaven.

739
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,439
But you said he didn't die.

740
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,565
He didn't, but he saw heaven.

741
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,399
He saw Jesus and angels and...

742
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,886
But how?

743
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,239
I don't know.

744
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,839
- Reverend Burpo.
- Todd.

745
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,439
Todd. Some of the hospital staff
have said, off the record,

746
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,079
that your son was not expected to
survive and used the word "miracle."

747
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,319
How would you explain that?

748
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,161
I haven't even
tried to, uh, do that.

749
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,719
Can you try?

750
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,239
If he didn't die, uh,
how could he see heaven?

751
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,199
I don't know, but he did.

752
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,368
Do you believe he was in heaven?

753
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,569
Uh...

754
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,930
I know he saw something.

755
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,089
It sure sounded like heaven.

756
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,239
Good Lord, what's
happened to our preacher?

757
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,282
Well, I thought
that went well, huh?

758
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,879
Nice view.

759
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,127
Mmm.

760
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,319
- I love being up so high.
- Mmm.

761
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,079
Colton! Hey!

762
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,011
I thought I asked you
to stop playing with that!

763
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,279
I'm sorry, Dad!

764
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,599
I told him not to, Dad!

765
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,799
Half the church
wants to stop feeling

766
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,319
and start thinking.

767
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,161
And the other half, they
want the exact opposite.

768
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,525
This is Todd.

769
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,767
Yeah.

770
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,490
Let me call you back.

771
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,164
That was the newspaper.

772
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,009
They want to do
an article about heaven.

773
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,007
And?

774
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,562
And they want to interview Colton.

775
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,041
And you think that's a good idea?

776
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,479
So, Colton, a lot of people
were praying for you.

777
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,999
I guess.

778
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,719
Well, that must feelgood.

779
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,685
Come over here, buddy.
You're being interviewed.

780
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,005
Thank you.

781
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,159
You were very sick.

782
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,408
What did it feel like to die?

783
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,399
I didn't die.

784
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,250
But you went to heaven?

785
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,962
That's a little off-topic.

786
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,850
It's beautiful.

787
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,799
You saw heaven?

788
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,079
Mmm-hmm.

789
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,999
What does it look like?

790
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,726
Like here, but even more beautiful.

791
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,925
And you saw Jesus?

792
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,047
Yeah.

793
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,283
He's very nice. I sat on his lap.
He has markers.

794
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,166
Markers?

795
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,839
Yeah. Right here and right here

796
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,088
and right here and right here.

797
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,126
Can I go swing on
the swing some more?

798
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,607
Yeah.

799
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,850
So, Jesus has a horse?

800
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,201
There are lots of
animals in heaven.

801
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,731
They don't believe me, do they?

802
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,286
Some people might
be afraid to believe.

803
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,719
What are they afraid of?

804
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,445
I don't know.

805
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,451
Maybe they're afraid
that there's no heaven.

806
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,401
Or maybe they're
afraid that there is.

807
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,209
You believe me, Daddy, don't you?

808
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,890
I believe God loves you.

809
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,286
And so do I.

810
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,722
Can I get your picture?

811
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,447
- What's that?
- Can I take your picture?

812
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,727
Yeah.

813
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,239
And...

814
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,444
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

815
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,519
Hello?

816
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,119
Oh, hi, Jay. Have you seen this?

817
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,639
Yeah, I read it a couple of times.

818
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,239
It's quite an article.

819
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,039
I love Todd, but I
love our church, too.

820
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,040
And I really can't stand to see
it turn into some kind of circus.

821
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,719
Why don't we get together?

822
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,119
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

823
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,879
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

824
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,003
- Bye-bye.
- All right, bye-bye.

825
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,008
Oh, no, that's okay. Actually,
I'm going to get out of here.

826
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,559
No, no. It's on me, buddy.

827
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,199
- What do you mean?
- It's on me.

828
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,599
- No. No. No. No. I got this.
- No. It's on me.

829
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,319
Sonja gives Rosa
clothes for Miguelito

830
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,279
whenever Colton outgrows anything.

831
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,041
And she gave Lucia a baby dress
that an angel would wear.

832
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,919
- A pink dress?
- Yeah, beautiful.

833
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,600
So, please, give me
the gift of giving back.

834
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,839
Okay. Thanks a lot.

835
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,519
- All right.
- Bye. Bye, sweetie.

836
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,006
Say bye, bye.

837
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,479
Hey. Hey, Burpo.

838
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,679
Hey, next time there's a fire,

839
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,119
maybe you should tell Jesus that

840
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,399
instead of walking on the water,

841
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,683
he could just dump
it all on your fire.

842
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,727
Right?

843
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,927
Oh, come on. You gotta
see the humor in it.

844
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,079
Taylor, pass it to me.

845
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,524
Come on. Yeah.

846
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,279
Ooh!

847
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,639
Hey, Cassie, did your brother
really sit on Jesus' lap?

848
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,763
Did he ask for a new bicycle

849
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,963
or a magic pony?

850
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,603
Hello. This is Todd.

851
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,440
Uh-huh. Yeah.

852
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,082
Well, I'm surprised to hear that.

853
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,519
Can you hold on?

854
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,239
Honey, did you punch
a kid in the nose today?

855
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,639
Uh-huh.

856
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,842
With your fist?

857
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,605
In the nose?

858
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,007
Yep.

859
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,804
But not one kid. Two.

860
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,279
What was the reason, honey?

861
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,599
She hits good when she wants to.

862
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,759
I'm sorry. Can I
call you fightback?

863
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,009
No, honey. I think we should
talk about this right now.

864
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,599
If you punched somebody, there must
have been a good reason for it.

865
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,319
They were making fun of Colton.

866
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,808
They made fun about him
sitting on Jesus' lap.

867
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,399
Honey, you know

868
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,559
you should have turned the
other cheek, though, right?

869
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,809
I did turn his other cheek.
When I hit him.

870
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,802
Is Cassie going to get a spanking?

871
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,559
Heck, no.

872
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,401
I'm just going to teach her to hit
without hurting her knuckles.

873
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,841
Hey.

874
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,639
Are you having trouble sleeping?

875
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,842
No. Are you?

876
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,766
Yeah.

877
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,163
It's pretty cool what
Cassie did today, huh?

878
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,210
Yeah. It's pretty cool.

879
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,045
Do you want to talk?

880
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,447
Sure.

881
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,087
Great. I like our talks.

882
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,439
Can we talk about heaven?

883
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,449
What would you like to know?

884
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,199
What did Jesus look like?

885
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,801
He's kind of hard to describe.

886
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,166
I'll bet.

887
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,845
Did he look

888
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,240
maybe like a picture you've seen?

889
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,485
How about...

890
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,759
Did he look like that?

891
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,440
The clothes. Not the face.

892
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,411
This one?

893
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,559
This?

894
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,047
No. Jesus has light eyes.

895
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,599
What color?

896
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,199
Bluish or green.

897
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,050
Bluish-greenish.

898
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,927
Uh-huh.

899
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,279
- Here.
- Hey.

900
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,919
Did you get enough sleep?

901
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,360
Not much.

902
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,806
So, he says that
Jesus has light eyes.

903
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,364
Greenish blue. Yours are
green, mine are blue.

904
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,609
He's seeing us.

905
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,922
It's quite a compliment, really.

906
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,279
In college, I read
something about, um,

907
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,119
our own personal concept of God

908
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,721
comes from our feelings
about our father.

909
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,050
I sure hope not. Mine had issues.

910
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,319
If our kids,

911
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,366
they grow up believing that they
are loved the way you love them,

912
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,848
the luckiest kids alive.

913
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,679
We've got a fire.

914
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,166
We sure have.

915
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,719
I'm going to take care
of that one, come home,

916
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,684
and add to this, all right?

917
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,279
I'll be here.

918
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,199
Get two hoses on that car!

919
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,399
No, no, no.

920
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,159
- They're in there!
- Who?

921
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,919
My family, they're in there!

922
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,999
- You've got a search?
- Yeah, he's saying they're in there.

923
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,319
Todd, you're in. Let's go,
let's run another one.

924
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,159
Here, you'll need this.

925
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,600
Keep him back.

926
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,085
Let's go, let's go!

927
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,279
That's hot! That's hot!

928
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,079
You can't go in there!

929
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,851
Hello? Is anyone here?

930
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,126
Hello?

931
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,202
It's clear! It's clear!

932
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,599
Charge. Clear.

933
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,759
Shock.

934
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,839
Charge. Clear. Shock.

935
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,199
Colton, this is just a visit,

936
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,609
but before you go back,
I want you to meet someone.

937
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,242
I heard you gave Michael
and Rosa a baby present.

938
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,531
Yeah, I, uh, thought
they could use it.

939
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,359
- Let's go out.
- What?

940
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,799
Yeah. Call Sheila.
She'll watch them.

941
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,079
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

942
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,479
Honey, no, we can't afford it.

943
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,199
That charity auction
last year, dinner for two.

944
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,959
Maple Grove restaurant,
your favorite place.

945
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,759
- We used that already.
- No, we did not.

946
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,079
We did. What are you doing?

947
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,009
No, we did not. We did not.

948
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,489
The darker the night,
the brighter they are.

949
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,611
Like you.

950
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,644
Yeah, you're good.

951
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,319
It's my best stuff.

952
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,049
It's getting darker, though.

953
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,124
We're out of money.

954
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,729
We're out of credit, too.

955
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,885
And the church board
called me today.

956
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,449
They want to sit down with you and
talk about where we're at as a church.

957
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,409
Why didn't they call me?

958
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,439
I don't think they wanted

959
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,484
you to think that they were
putting you on the spot.

960
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,159
Because they are
putting you on the spot.

961
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,799
Todd, we're prepared for you
to have all kinds of struggles,

962
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,731
and we're here to support
you during those times.

963
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,239
We've extended a leave of absence.

964
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,408
- Twice.
- Twice, right.

965
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,041
So, I think you're aware the church
is not doing very well without you

966
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,400
and so we need to know what to
plan for in the close future.

967
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,239
The question for me isn't
whether you're preaching,

968
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,239
it's what you're preaching.

969
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,399
Colton's trip to heaven
disturbs a lot of people.

970
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,965
It disturbs me.

971
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,079
Do you take it as a literal event?

972
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,079
Well, for him, it's not imaginary.

973
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,999
It's not a metaphor or
a feeling. It happened.

974
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,519
And I take that seriously.

975
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,839
I just don't know what to
make of it. You know?

976
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,799
What about it bothers you so much?

977
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,359
What is it? I mean, I want to talk
about it. I need to talk about it.

978
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,530
All right. I don't
like that it feels like, um,

979
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,679
some fairy tale,

980
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,119
just a simple, easy explanation
of life. I don't like that.

981
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,879
Okay. So, because it
appeals to simple people?

982
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,439
No. No. Yeah.

983
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,959
Okay. I don't like how
it makes our church

984
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,999
a magnet for everyone who wants to
take the brain out of their head

985
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,439
and beat it to death with the Bible

986
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,008
and then seem to want to show
off how much they believe.

987
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,519
Heaven and hell have
always been concepts

988
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,690
that have been used to
control and frighten people.

989
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,959
That's one way to look at it, but

990
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,039
all Colton's ever
talked about is heaven

991
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,050
and how it's a beautiful place.

992
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,525
Todd, what do you
plan on preaching?

993
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,159
All of us have times
when we lose our way.

994
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,479
That's when we look to leaders.

995
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,999
If you're going
to lead this church,

996
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,521
you've got to make a decision.

997
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,886
All right. I say that we give
Todd a little bit more time.

998
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,204
One more week.

999
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,159
But in the meantime,
we need to start planning

1000
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,519
for the future of our church

1001
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,961
and looking for someone else.

1002
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,201
Here you go. B-U-R-P-O.

1003
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,679
Yeah, we've got everything ready
to settle your account today.

1004
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,679
I can't do that today.

1005
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,679
I had an unforeseen situation.

1006
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,679
- You're not going to settle today?
- Uh, not today.

1007
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:48,079
Well, you are aware that we have
extended your accounts twice already.

1008
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,239
I think it's been one extension.

1009
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,399
No, it's been twice.

1010
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,679
And they are going to
collections as we speak.

1011
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,168
Okay, but the collections
is not something that, uh...

1012
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,919
Hey, Colton.

1013
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,719
Hospital policy demands
that I tell you

1014
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,559
your account is going
to collections.

1015
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,125
Colton.

1016
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,286
Colton!

1017
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,084
Hey, come here.

1018
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,119
Colton!

1019
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,279
I need to tell them. Please.

1020
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,766
Come here.

1021
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,090
Yes, sweetie.

1022
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:30,925
They don't look like that.

1023
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,408
It's all right. No one
will ever hurt you.

1024
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,159
Come on, guys, hurry up.

1025
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,522
Mom's got a music conference today.

1026
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,479
Hurry, hurry.

1027
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,685
Hey, you didn't tell me how the,
uh, church board meeting went.

1028
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,080
They've started looking
for somebody else.

1029
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,725
Guys, let's go, come on.
Go brush your teeth.

1030
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,407
Well, we'll figure it out.

1031
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,845
You didn't come to bed
until it was almost dawn.

1032
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,641
I was researching
near-death experiences.

1033
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,087
- Are you all right?
- It's fine!

1034
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,879
It's fine. I mean,
don't you think that...

1035
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,359
Hey! What?

1036
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,239
We need to be talking about
this life? Not the next one.

1037
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,439
I'm right here. What do
you want to talk about?

1038
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,719
We need to make sure our children
are safe and they are happy.

1039
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,119
And that they are normal!

1040
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,322
Happy, Yes! And normal! I agree!

1041
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,079
I have to go out to that
service for that loner

1042
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,879
who died after the fire
in his motor home.

1043
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,599
He didn't have any
friends or next of kin.

1044
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,079
You've got Colton today.

1045
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,439
I'm going to take him with me.

1046
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,766
Great.

1047
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,479
He's never been freaked out in those
situations. He's a lot of comfort.

1048
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,682
Oh, for the dead man or for you?

1049
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,126
Touché.

1050
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,125
Touché.Touché.

1051
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,999
Our Father who art in heaven,

1052
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,799
hallowed be Thy name.

1053
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,759
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

1054
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,964
on earth as it is in heaven.

1055
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,442
Give us this day, our daily bread.

1056
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,122
Aim. Begin.

1057
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,159
You had a grandpa
named "Pop," right?

1058
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,646
That's right.

1059
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,004
Was he your daddy's daddy
or your mommy's daddy?

1060
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,483
He was my mom's dad. He died
when I was about your age.

1061
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,570
He's very nice.

1062
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,924
You saw Pop?
You saw my grandfather?

1063
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,045
You saw him?

1064
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,399
Where did you see him?

1065
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,840
In heaven.

1066
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,879
I loved my grandfather very much.

1067
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,924
He was there with me
when my father couldn't be.

1068
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,290
He taught me to weld.
He gave me that slingshot.

1069
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,919
I know. We play with it.

1070
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,521
That's right.
And he was a good man.

1071
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,447
He was a really good man, but I
don't know what he believed in.

1072
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,444
None of us did.

1073
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,726
I think

1074
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,290
he's one of the reasons
your dad became a minister.

1075
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,519
I was hoping he would get a
break getting into heaven then.

1076
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,159
You don't have to worry, Dad.
He's there.

1077
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,079
He came up to me and told
me he was your grandfather

1078
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,599
and you called him "Pop."

1079
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,879
And he held me in his lap
just like Jesus did.

1080
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,050
And he told me
everything was all right.

1081
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,447
Okay, look at this.

1082
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,879
Is this him?
Is this the man you saw?

1083
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,162
No. That's not who I saw.

1084
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,079
Okay, but just look.
Are you sure? Colton?

1085
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,559
Nobody wears glasses in heaven.

1086
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,759
Can I go play? Because
when Mom gets home...

1087
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,769
Are you sure that's not him?

1088
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,879
- It's not him.
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1089
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,399
When Mom gets home...

1090
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,719
Mom will be home in a second.

1091
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,922
Just wait one second. Wait.

1092
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,326
Colton?

1093
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,364
That's him. That's Pop.

1094
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,166
In heaven, everybody's young.

1095
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,803
Are you okay, Dad?

1096
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,479
An awful lot happened
to you in heaven.

1097
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,001
Yeah, it was amazing.

1098
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,763
Todd, dinner is going
to be ready in five...

1099
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,799
Are you okay?

1100
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,604
Colton saw Pop.

1101
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,128
In heaven. My grandfather.

1102
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,159
I don't know what to make of this.

1103
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,839
Well, I don't have the luxury
of not knowing, Sonja.

1104
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,520
I don't. Everything he tells me,

1105
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,761
it hits me, you know?
And I want to believe him.

1106
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,919
Okay, I want to believe
him. He's four.

1107
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,719
He's four. He's so innocent,
he can't be making this up,

1108
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,366
but everything he talks
about is impossible.

1109
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,519
It is a massive adventure
that he's created.

1110
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,999
He's talking about Jesus,
seeing Jesus' horse.

1111
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,044
He talks about choirs of
angels and my grandfather.

1112
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,839
It would take weeks or days, but,
"For God a day is a thousand years."

1113
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,679
"And a thousand years but a day."

1114
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,119
I'm just saying that's scripture.

1115
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,279
It's scripture. There's no clock.

1116
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,719
There's no clock. Einstein
talks about the same thing.

1117
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,439
"Some reality is beyond time."

1118
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,722
Why can't it just be a mystery?

1119
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,079
Because I think God might be trying
to reach out to us through Colton.

1120
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,199
That's what I think.

1121
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,199
What Colton is telling us, Todd,
is an echo of every story,

1122
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,759
every song, every image he's
seen since he was a child.

1123
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,850
Why does this have
to be a myth? Why?

1124
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,439
I don't know. I don't
know how to move on

1125
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,005
with my life.

1126
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,524
Tell me what to do.

1127
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,125
I don't know.

1128
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,799
All I care about is if my husband

1129
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,844
and my family know
that I love them.

1130
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,123
I'm sorry I can't help you
with any of this.

1131
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,683
Well, I'm here.

1132
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,525
Where are you?

1133
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,279
Please accept this flag as a
symbol of our appreciation

1134
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,119
for your loved one's honorable
and faithful service.

1135
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,767
Your son was a hero.
He died a brave marine.

1136
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,521
You.

1137
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,999
I always figured it was Jay leaving

1138
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,283
flags and flowers
here on my son's grave.

1139
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,363
I failed you, Nancy.

1140
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,519
The worst moment of your life,

1141
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,725
loss beyond comprehension,
and I had...

1142
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,370
I had nothing for you.

1143
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,490
No comfort.

1144
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,406
No hope.

1145
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,405
No peace.

1146
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,479
I should have maybe...

1147
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,279
No, you didn't let me down.

1148
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,643
You couldn't take my pain away
and I didn't want it gone.

1149
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,361
For a while, pain was all
I had of him.

1150
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,526
You don't have to
save the world, Todd.

1151
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,846
I believe that's already been done.

1152
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,322
Since that meeting at the church

1153
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,924
where I was the bitter woman
I swore I'd never be,

1154
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,410
I've been thinking.

1155
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,210
It's not the people of
the church I'm mad at.

1156
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,522
And it's not you. Not your son.

1157
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,885
It's God.

1158
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,363
Why God would give you your
son back and take mine away.

1159
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,882
When Colton was in that hospital,

1160
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,364
I saw he was dying

1161
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,802
and some part of me broke.

1162
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,646
Some part that still hasn't mended.

1163
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,239
Nancy, you don't ever
have to apologize to me

1164
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,761
for any broken part you carry.

1165
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,004
Do you think...

1166
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,130
I have to ask.

1167
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,971
Do you think my son went to heaven?

1168
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,241
Do you love your son still?

1169
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,085
Of course.

1170
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,079
Do you think I love mine?

1171
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,805
I know you do.

1172
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,967
Do you think I love my son
more than you love yours?

1173
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,840
No.

1174
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,687
Do you think God loves my son
more than he loves yours?

1175
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,119
Mommy?

1176
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,799
Yes, Colton.

1177
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,843
Did you know I have a sister?

1178
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,490
Yes, Colton, of course,
I know you have a sister.

1179
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,525
I didn't know.

1180
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,166
You didn't know that
Cassie is your sister?

1181
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,881
No, I have two sisters.

1182
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,323
You had a baby die in
your tummy, didn't you?

1183
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,571
Honey, who told you I had
a baby die in my tummy?

1184
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,770
She told me she died in your tummy.

1185
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,809
What does she look like?

1186
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,565
Like Cassie, but a little smaller.

1187
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,839
And hair like yours.

1188
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,839
In heaven, this little
girl came up to me

1189
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,088
and she wouldn't stop hugging me.

1190
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,079
Honey, what did...
What was her name?

1191
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,727
She didn't have a name.
You guys didn't name her.

1192
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,327
You're right. We didn't. We, uh...

1193
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,846
We didn't know
that she was a "she."

1194
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,767
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- Yeah.

1195
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,402
We lost a baby, sweetheart,

1196
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,242
just a few months before she was...

1197
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,081
Todd.

1198
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,286
That's our baby.
That's our little girl.

1199
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,919
She's okay.

1200
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,279
I don't want to be late for school
today and the phone's ringing!

1201
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,891
I'll get it.

1202
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,079
Hi.

1203
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,159
Pastor Todd Burpo?

1204
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,319
This is Todd.

1205
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,319
Great. We're live on
the air with Todd Burpo.

1206
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,599
Can you tell us about your
son's adventure in heaven?

1207
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,239
- On the air?
- Dad!

1208
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,679
Everybody here in Imperial followed
the story of your son's sickness

1209
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,079
and people all over town were
praying for his recovery.

1210
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,919
Now we're starting to hear of an
amazing trip he took to heaven.

1211
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,199
Can you tell us about that?

1212
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,131
Come by Crossroads
Wesleyan Church on Sunday.

1213
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,322
I'll tell you all about it.

1214
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,088
♪ Here's my heart now

1215
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,639
♪ Take and seal it

1216
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:09,244

01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,570
I love you.

1222
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,921
I'm standing here today with
wounds that are still healing,

1223
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,159
fears that are still echoing

1224
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,519
and in that way, maybe some of you

1225
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,999
are sitting here this
morning exactly like me.

1226
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,839
I can say truthfully that
the pain that I suffered,

1227
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:07,809
it was nothing compared to watching
my son that close to death.

1228
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,041
So, now we've got a question.

1229
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,129
Was Colton in heaven?

1230
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,406
Yes.

1231
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,481
He was in the heaven
that God showed him.

1232
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,404
Is heaven real?

1233
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,967
'Cause, if heaven is for real,

1234
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,689
we'd all lead different
lives, wouldn't we?

1235
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,331
Would we?

1236
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,079
Really? Haven't we
already seen heaven?

1237
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:49,127
In the first cry of a baby,
the courage of a friend,

1238
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,439
the hands of a nurse

1239
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,759
or a doctor, the love
of a mother or father.

1240
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,279
Haven't we already
had a glimpse of heaven

1241
01:25:56,280 --> 01:26:00,371
and so often chosen the hell

1242
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,444
of hate and fear?

1243
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:06,919
Is heaven for real?

1244
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,239
Every single one of you
has asked that question.

1245
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,364
All of us have. And
for me, the answer...

1246
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,445
It's "yes."

1247
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,169
I see it, so I believe it.

1248
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,679
And what we believe
changes what we perceive.

1249
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:28,488
And I believe that God, he's love.

1250
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,759
Ten thousand times I've been
here and I've talked about

1251
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,849
"On earth as it is in heaven."

1252
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,330
And I don't know that
I ever listened to that.

1253
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:47,119
And my son, he saw something.
He saw heaven.

1254
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,368
He'll tell you all about Jesus.

1255
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,242
How about that name? "Jesus."

1256
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,890
Ooh.

1257
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,491
"Jesus."

1258
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,411
It creates so much hope
in so many of you,

1259
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,841
so much distrust in so many others.

1260
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,730
That's okay.

1261
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,159
I believe God asked me
to be a pastor.

1262
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,039
Did he insist on my vision
being the same as yours?

1263
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,685
Or yours?

1264
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:22,199
Of course not. Did he make
me one of those heroes like

1265
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,839
that lion and the bear and
unicorn I preached about?

1266
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,045
No. That's what I wanted.
God had a different plan.

1267
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,767
God crushed my pride.

1268
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,284
He opened my heart

1269
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,770
to love.

1270
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,448
And all I have to do,

1271
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,762
the one thing this love requires

1272
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,645
is that I let others know
they're not alone.

1273
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,168
So amazing.

1274
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,321
Welcome back. Good work, buddy.

1275
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,159
It's good to see you.

1276
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,600
Hey, Randy.

1277
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:57,286
Are things okay over there?

1278
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,759
What? What? What was that?

1279
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,486
- Hey, thanks very much, John.
- You're welcome.

1280
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,087
Thanks. You, too. I am.

1281
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,490
Hey, Ray.

1282
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:56,001
She picked up the brush when
she was just six years old.

1283
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,319
But the visions...

1284
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,359
- Mom, can I have some lemonade, please?
- Of course.

1285
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,679
- Started when she was just four.
- Uh-huh.

1286
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,319
Look at this on CNN.

1287
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,559
She's a self-taught painter.

1288
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,639
It's about a girl on the
other side of the world

1289
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,286
who had an experience
a lot like Colton's.

1290
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,082
She saw visions of heaven.
Look at this. Angels.

1291
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,359
She began to describe to her
mother in great detail...

1292
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,839
Look at this, honey.
This is incredible.

1293
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,769
Her visits to heaven.

1294
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,199
It's nice, honey, but I
have got to talk to you.

1295
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,519
Okay.

1296
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:24,999
Okay, but she's...

1297
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,205
At the age of four, she began to
describe her visits to heaven.

1298
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:30,721
See?

1299
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,043
Colton? Are you okay?

1300
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,890
That's him.

1301
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,128
That's... Huh?

1302
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,605
But... Colton.

1303
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,289
That's him?

1304
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,759
That's who you saw?
Colton, come here.

1305
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,959
I've got to talk to you.

1306
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,959
Come on. This is...

1307
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,399
Hey, I want to talk to you.

1308
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,879
He told me that painting back there
that girl saw is what Colton saw.

1309
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,039
Todd, you know that little baby-blue
outfit we keep in the drawer?

1310
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,925
Todd, we're going to need this.

1311
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,126
Really?

1312
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,650
- Really?
- Yeah.

1313
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,364
- Wow.
- I know.

1314
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,079
Wow, when did you find out?

1315
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,691
Yesterday.
