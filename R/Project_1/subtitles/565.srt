1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
Unit 40 requesting assistance.

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
We have a possible 211 in progress
at the Valley Trust Bank...

3
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,300
... Boyle and Kittridge.
We have shots fired.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,300
All units, officer needs assistance.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,800
Boyle, north of Kittridge, at the Valley
Trust Bank. Shots have been fired.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
We'll need a heavy-duty vehicle.
We're pinned by automatic gunfire.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,500
"15-L"- "10 advise, do you need"
some heavy-duty machinery...

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,900
... to get the officer up?

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,300
They've got automatic weapons.
Nothing we have can stop them.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,100
Be advised, there's possibly two
or three suspects inside.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,400
Shots being fired!
Shots being fired!

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Suspects heavily armed
and wearing body armor.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,200
Get more officers.

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,400
Officer down! Officer down!

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Requesting SWAT. Code Three.

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,700
I'm killing whoever moves!
You move, I'm killing you!

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,500
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

18
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,700
SWAT's just arrived.

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,200
- We're 30 seconds out, boys.
- All right.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,700
Suspects have AK-47 s,
dressed in heavy body armor.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Let's rock 'n' roll.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
This is a table.

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,700
We have four cameras
over the tellers.

24
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,900
- Do we have a visual?
- Almost.

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,600
- We cut their phones?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
Soon as you get tapped in,
let me have it.

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
10-David standing by,
position three.

28
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Suspect's trying to get
in the driver-side door.

29
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,100
Do not let them get mobile.

30
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,800
- He's down.
- Goddamn it! They got Bob!

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
Grab somebody! Grab somebody
and bring them up here!

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
- Get up.
- No.

33
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,900
- I said, get up!
- No!

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,200
Throw a body out there,
tell them we mean business!

35
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,600
Street, 10-David. Storeroom is clear.

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,200
Almost to the lobby.

37
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Shut up!

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,500
10-David to Street.
Hold your position.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
- 10-David wants us to hold.
- Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

40
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,100
We hold, they die.

41
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,200
I guess we're not holding.

42
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,600
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill somebody!

43
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,300
Take a headshot.

44
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,000
They just capped E ddie! How the hell
we gonna get out of here?

45
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,900
Shut up, I'm thinking!

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,300
10-David to all units, we are
sending in a secure phone.

47
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,100
Please.

48
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Stop whining! I'll put a bullet
in your head!

49
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
Shut up!

50
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,500
What are they doing?

51
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,500
This is Rick from the L.A.P.D.
Can you hear me okay?

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,200
10-David to Street. Hold your
position. CN T has him on the phone.

53
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,500
10-David to the 1-4 corner.
Confirm that you have containment.

54
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Roger, we're holding
on the 1-4 corner.

55
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,700
10-David to all units.
Confirm that you're holding.

56
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,900
- We're holding top of stairwell.
- Shut up.

57
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Gamble, Street, where are you?
Why aren't you responding?

58
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,300
Let's be cool. Calm down.

59
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
I'm controlling this situation!
You understand me?

60
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,300
- Please.
- We need to go!

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
No, please. Somebody...

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,900
Help me. Help me.

63
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,800
Gamble, Street, why aren't you
responding? Now!

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Oh, God!

65
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
Kill that bitch and throw her out front!

66
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Get that guy off our fence!

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I said to kill that bitch
and throw her out front!

68
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm on TV!

69
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,400
Street, 10-David. Lobby is clear.

70
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,100
Two suspects are neutralized.

71
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,900
I need an RA unit
for a gunshot wound to a hostage.

72
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
You're gonna be fine, ma'am.
Ambulance is on the way.

73
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,800
Got them, right?

74
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,400
Jimbo?

75
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,700
- She'll be okay?
- I'm not a doctor.

76
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,700
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

77
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,700
Boss is gonna tear you guys
a new one, huh?

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,900
Same place he did the last time,
time before that.

79
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Good luck.

80
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,400
I don't care what they say.

81
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,900
You guys were heroes out there.

82
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,700
That was some cocky shit out there.

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,200
You know how to play this, right?

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
That woman is alive
because of what we did.

85
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah, alive and suing the city
for millions.

86
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,600
Chief says if he pays,
somebody else does too...

87
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,300
...and it sure isn't gonna be me.

88
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
- Fuller, we get two seconds to make...
- Capt. Fuller!

89
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,600
Capt. Fuller, we get two seconds
to make a decision.

90
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,000
You get two months to sit there
and tear it apart.

91
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,500
SWAT means "Special Weapons
And Tactics."

92
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,500
Where were your tactics out there?

93
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,400
Saving a woman from getting shot.
That's where they were.

94
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,300
Every cop knows
we did the right thing.

95
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,300
Sometimes doing the right thing
isn't doing the right thing.

96
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,100
- What the hell does that mean?
- Sergeant.

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
You disobeyed a direct order.
End of story. You're both off SWAT.

98
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,500
They're two of our best officers.

99
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm not sticking them in the field
after a stunt like that.

100
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,600
Sorry, I didn't know that saving lives
was a stunt.

101
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,600
You got a big mouth,
and you're quick on the trigger...

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,900
...and that is why your ass
is in a sling.

103
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,700
If you're gonna put them off SWAT,
at least keep them in the division.

104
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,700
Give them a shot at getting back.

105
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,800
Stick them in the gun cage.
Get them out of my sight.

106
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,000
- Gun cage?
- This is total bullshit.

107
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
- What?
- I said, this is bullshit.

108
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

109
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,200
You should consider yourself lucky
Lt. Velasquez is standing up for you.

110
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm lucky I don't work
for an asshole like you.

111
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
That's it! You're out of here, Gamble!
You're gone!

112
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,000
- Control yourself!
- Get out of here!

113
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,500
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Street!

114
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
- You stay.
- Hey!

115
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,300
Give us a minute.

116
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,900
Please, sit down.

117
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,700
I'll stand.

118
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,500
Look, Jim...

119
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,500
...we both know that Gamble is a bad
influence on the rest of the team.

120
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
Gamble's a good cop.

121
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,500
Unlike him, you still have a chance
at a future here.

122
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
You go on record that Gamble
acted recklessly...

123
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,300
...and you had to follow your partner in
after he disobeyed orders...

124
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
...and I will make sure that you are
back on SWAT tomorrow morning.

125
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,700
Let's get the hell out of here.

126
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,000
I need a cocktail.

127
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm staying.

128
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,500
You're what? What...?

129
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,500
- After that?
- Couple months...

130
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,400
...Fuller will find new asses to
chew out. We'll be back on the team.

131
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,800
Fuller is the cockroach
of this department, brother.

132
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
He's not gonna give us
a second chance.

133
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,800
What are you gonna do? Piss away
all the hard work you did to get here?

134
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Piss what away, Jimmy?

135
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,100
The cage?

136
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Come on, man.

137
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,900
We're better than that,
and you know it.

138
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
You gonna come with me?

139
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,500
A real partner wouldn't have
to ask that, would he?

140
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,800
A real partner would step up
to what he did in the bank.

141
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
- Yeah. I saved the hostage.
- You disobeyed the hold.

142
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,900
- No, I saved that hostage!
- You disobeyed the hold!

143
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,800
You made the decision yourself.

144
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
And you shot a hostage.
Jesus, Brian!

145
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
You sound a lot like Fuller.

146
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,100
Is that what you two were talking
about in there?

147
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
Did you rat me out?

148
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
You cut a deal to get back
on the team, Jimmy?

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,700
- Did I cut a deal?
- Yeah, did you?

150
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,900
How many times have I covered up
for one of your goddamn stunts?

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,500
That's what a partner's
supposed to do.

152
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,400
You just picked a paycheck
over me, bro.

153
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,300
You just picked yourself
over everything else.

154
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You want to stay here
and be Fuller's bitch...

155
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,200
...you go right ahead.
I can't do it.

156
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,200
I can't do it.

157
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,800
Damn it. Goddamn it.
Goddamn it, Jim!

158
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,900
Partners for five years.
This is how you want to end it.

159
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I didn't end it.

160
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,700
You sold me out to the brass.

161
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,000
You know, I never realized till now
how full of shit you are.

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Fuck you and SWAT.

163
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
- You're too attached to that soda, Gus.
- Love that stuff.

164
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,700
The wife would have my behind
if she busted me sucking that down.

165
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,900
Why, is she a Mr. Pibb fan?

166
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
You know the deal, Jim.

167
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,900
When we got married,
I converted to Mormonism.

168
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,200
We can't consume anything
that alters our state of mind.

169
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,800
We treat our bodies with respect.

170
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,600
And I treat mine
like an amusement park.

171
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,200
It's the differences
that make this country great.

172
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,400
Need them cleaned
by the morning, boys.

173
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
You were supposed to have
it in a half-hour ago.

174
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,100
What, your boy gonna report me
to the captain?

175
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,100
Just for thinking you look good
in that mustache.

176
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,100
Your mom seems to like it, though.

177
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
So does your sister.

178
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey, sarge, welcome back.

179
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,800
- Look who's back.
- Welcome back, sarge.

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
What's up, Hondo?

181
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Hey, sarge.

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,600
- Howdy.
- What do you need?

183
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,700
Sgt. Hondo? You're back.

184
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,600
You know what they say, Gus.
You're either SWAT or you're not.

185
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,300
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

186
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,900
Oh, just a tune-up.

187
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,000
But please, don't touch my sights.

188
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,100
- And I made some modifications...
- To the trigger too.

189
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,200
- And you are?
- Jim Street.

190
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
Street.

191
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah, we'll leave them intact.

192
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,200
- I need that back by tomorrow.
- Can do, sergeant.

193
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,500
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.

194
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Gosh, Gus, is that a woody?

195
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Heck, yeah. That's Hondo.

196
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
He's old-school SWAT.

197
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,100
The gold standard of ass-kicking.

198
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,800
Sorry, butt-kicking. I guess he's back.

199
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,700
I guess he is.

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,700
A weeklong series,
attacking us top to bottom.

201
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,400
And it's all SWAT's fault, right?

202
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
No, the chief's been pretty fair
about blaming everyone.

203
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,000
He does want these
bad headlines to end.

204
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,800
He wants the old warhorses to help
restore the luster.

205
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,400
Old? I know you ain't
talking about me.

206
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,900
You gotta shake off
that three-year rust from Rampart.

207
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
- I'm throwing you in right away.
- Sooner the better.

208
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,800
I want you to put together a young,
kick-ass element for me, Dan.

209
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,300
You select them, you train them,
you mold them.

210
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,900
I know you're not talking about giving
me five pups fresh out of the gate.

211
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,800
- I didn't come back to wipe noses.
- Hell, no.

212
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Now, you worked with T.J. And Boxer
at Southwest.

213
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
- You up for supervising them here?
- That's a start.

214
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,400
Now all you have to do
is find three fresh ones.

215
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Only catch is, Fuller has
to approve the three.

216
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,300
What did Capt. Fuller say when he
heard the chief was bringing me back?

217
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,200
Hasn't stopped swearing since.

218
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
What's your brother's truck
doing outside?

219
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,400
We having a garage sale
I don't know about?

220
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
You weren't supposed to be home
for an hour.

221
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,500
Sorry to screw up your getaway.

222
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Look, let's not make this
a thing, okay?

223
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,700
We both knew it was coming.

224
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,200
It's not like we were in this
to get married, right?

225
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
And you've changed since...

226
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,300
Well, people change.

227
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,000
Look, when it was good
it was great, right?

228
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
That means something.

229
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,500
Yeah, thanks.

230
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
- Damn it!
- Hey! Hey!

231
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm gonna throw this thing out.

232
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,900
Do and you die.

233
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,700
Every SWAT team in the world's
gonna have one someday.

234
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,800
It's 50 pounds of scrap metal.

235
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,400
All right.

236
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,300
Say you got some crazy suspect
barricaded in a house.

237
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,500
- All right.
- Just chain this to the back of a truck...

238
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,900
...shove this end
right through the wall...

239
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,200
...these rods spring out
like fishhooks.

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Your partner guns the truck,
takes the whole wall with him.

241
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
And we waltz right in
and surprise the bad guy, right?

242
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,700
Correct.

243
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,500
I call it "The Key to the City."

244
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,900
- Patent pending.
- Is that right?

245
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
Right.

246
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,800
Let me get your M-4.

247
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,900
And...

248
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Took the rattle out of the receiver.

249
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, new buffer, new gas rings.
Cleaned the gas tube.

250
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Surprised you didn't starch the sling.

251
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,100
If you want me to show you how to
shoot it, I'm here all week, 9 to 5.

252
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,200
Shooters, on the line!

253
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,100
Stand by! Ready!

254
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,200
Put them on safe and holster.

255
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
No roll, Hondo?

256
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,400
How do you know I didn't?

257
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
You didn't, did you?

258
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
They only roll in John Woo movies,
not real life.

259
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
All right.

260
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,900
Here's the winner.

261
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,900
There's a few people
that I would like to thank.

262
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
My fellow SWAT officers, all of you,
thank you for believing in me...

263
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,200
...when the bosses didn't give me
a chance.

264
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,700
That's why you're the marksman and
I'm the guy who tells you who to shoot.

265
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Here you go. I got you covered
since I let you down.

266
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,600
Tell you what...

267
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,500
...I got 100 here says that guy
can kick your ass.

268
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,700
Are you kidding me, Hondo?
Come on. He's our gun bunny.

269
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,100
Oh, well, let's make it 200 then.

270
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,100
Sure. A couple more lap dances
for me tonight.

271
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,200
- Want a piece of this?
- Yeah.

272
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,400
Don't look so worried.

273
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Yo.

274
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Wanna make some extra money?

275
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,900
Hey, don't forget to take
your safety off.

276
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,800
- Street.
- You better get your game face on.

277
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Don't beat him so badly I can't get
a rematch, all right?

278
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,200
I won't make any promises.

279
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
It's my money, man.

280
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Shooters, on the line!

281
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Shooters, on the line!

282
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,500
Stand by! Ready!

283
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,900
Put them on safe! Holster!

284
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,100
Here's your winner.

285
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,600
I won, baby.

286
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,600
Thoroughbred!

287
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,100
Yeah, yeah. Passport, please.

288
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
Next.

289
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,800
- Next.
- You have anything to declare?

290
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,200
I don't know how you got this
through De Gaulle.

291
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,500
You can't bring this
through the airport.

292
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,600
For luck. Luck.

293
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,700
Gift from my father. Not dangerous.

294
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,500
- Mail it home.
- Okay.

295
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,400
Mail it home.

296
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,600
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay. "Merci."

297
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,800
- Hey, Gus!
- Yeah.

298
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,500
Isn't that eternal damnation
you're chowing down there?

299
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,400
You can't tell Michelle.

300
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Isn't she gonna smell the fries
on your breath?

301
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,000
That's why God invented mouthwash.
She'll never know.

302
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,400
Gus, you're cheating on your wife
with fast food.

303
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,500
You're right. You're absolutely right.

304
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Street, you have a driver's license?

305
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,900
- Got a library card.
- That's good enough.

306
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,600
So get your uniform on.
You're driving me today.

307
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,100
Come on.

308
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Did you get my return ticket
and papers?

309
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,100
Flight leaves tonight at midnight.

310
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,400
- No one knows I'm here?
- Just me.

311
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,400
Where do you wanna go?

312
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
It's my uncle's birthday.

313
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
I want to surprise him.

314
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,900
If you want me to come by
and mow your lawn later...

315
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,400
...I'm available, sergeant.
- I'll keep that in mind.

316
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,500
Call me Hondo.

317
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,700
I was a Marine. Did two years
in Nam, recon unit.

318
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,300
Spent the next four teaching
combat survival. You serve?

319
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,800
- Yeah.
- Navy SEALs, right?

320
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,500
- That's what my file says.
- So, what did you do for them?

321
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Besides rescue Marines
when they got lost?

322
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,700
You sniper detail,
amphibious assault, what?

323
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,800
My boat-crew leader always said
if anyone knew what we did...

324
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,200
...we'd failed.

325
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,200
That's fair enough.

326
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
So where are we going, Hondo?

327
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,300
What say we go see what
the weather's like in South Central?

328
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,500
Tell us where your boyfriend is.

329
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,400
Look, I don't speak Spanish!
Tell me where your boyfriend is!

330
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,700
You're not helping him any!
You're not...

331
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,100
Somebody here gonna get locked up!

332
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
R-61-15 in foot pursuit.

333
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,700
Suspect headed south,
west of Defiance.

334
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,800
One black male in Lakers purple.

335
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,900
Repeat: One black male
in Lakers purple.

336
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,600
That's our guy talking.
Where's he at?

337
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
What the hell you doing, Navy SEAL?

338
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,500
- Oh, hell yeah! Get on, baby, get on!
- Come on!

339
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,000
Damn! That looked like some Oakland
Raider Jack Tatum action there.

340
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,700
What you know about Jack Tatum?

341
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,900
Turn your ass over!
Put your hands behind your back!

342
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,300
- Name's Hondo.
- I don't give a damn.

343
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,800
I could've caught him myself.

344
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,300
If you like hard work, long hours
and getting dirty for low pay...

345
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
...I got an opening
on my SWAT team.

346
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
Shut up!

347
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
I don't mind that at all.

348
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,200
Pack your bags.
You're coming to SWAT school.

349
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,300
- SWAT school?
- Shut up!

350
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,300
Don't talk too much! Shut up!

351
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,800
Don't y'all got nothing better to do
than be hauling a black man to jail?

352
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,900
Just perpetuating the cycle,
ain't you?

353
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,200
We'll see how liberal you are
when he's breaking into your place.

354
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,300
"Uh-huh," my ass.

355
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,700
Sure you don't want to sit
in the back?

356
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I could wear a little cap.

357
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,000
I like the view from up here.

358
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
The cap thing's a nice touch, though.

359
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Officer Burress, Southwest Division.

360
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,200
Well, your test scores are off the chart,
and you got all the right references.

361
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Thank you, sergeant.

362
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,500
Can I get a hot dog with everything
and a ginger ale, please?

363
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,500
Hot dog with everything,
ginger ale.

364
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,000
- Street?
- Same.

365
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,800
Well, I will have a soy dog,
please...

366
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,700
...on a whole-wheat bun, plain...

367
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,100
...and a tomato juice, if you got it.

368
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,700
Thank you.

369
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm a vegetarian.

370
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,100
I'm a bit curious.

371
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,500
You've been a cop six years and
you've never had a civilian complaint?

372
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,900
I try to be courteous and professional
with everyone I encounter.

373
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,900
Well, the thing is, Dave...

374
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,500
- David.
- Right. David.

375
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,100
Here's the thing.

376
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,400
There may come a time in SWAT
when you gotta get a little dirty...

377
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,800
...behind a street bust.
You know what I'm saying?

378
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,200
No.

379
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,600
How the hell can I trust a man...

380
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,900
...won't eat a good old-fashioned
American hot dog?

381
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,700
He's a vegetarian.

382
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,500
I'm looking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

383
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,100
I'm looking for an injured officer,
name of Sanchez.

384
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,100
Chris Sanchez.

385
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
- Room five. In the corner.
- Thank you.

386
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,400
- What do you need, sarge?
- You Sanchez's partner?

387
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,000
Sanchez do that?

388
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,600
- You help?
- No, sarge.

389
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,500
Reminds me of my third divorce.

390
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,300
- Bad day, huh?
- Kiss my ass, "ése".

391
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,800
I'm starting to like
this Sanchez already.

392
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,300
Spent four years in Metro,
passed the SWAT quals three times.

393
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,500
Been rejected by Fuller three times.

394
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,000
Might be a reason.
He's got a couple of beefs here.

395
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,400
I'm going to get the nurse
to clean and dress your wound.

396
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,400
Sorry. Wrong room.

397
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
- Who you looking for?
- Chris Sanchez.

398
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,200
I'm Chris Sanchez.

399
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,200
You're Chris Sanchez?

400
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,800
Look, if you're Internal Affairs...

401
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,300
...that guy had razorblades
in his mouth.

402
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,300
I had to put him down hard.

403
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,500
I'm sick and tired of these bullshit
complaints because some "vato..."

404
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,400
...doesn't like getting thrown
to the pavement by a woman.

405
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
I look like IAD to you?

406
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Who are you?

407
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,000
Wait, now, that guy had about
100 pounds on you.

408
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,100
All brawn, no brains.
You didn't answer my question.

409
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,900
So you still want to work SWAT?

410
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,500
No, I just enjoy applying all the time.

411
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,800
Gas it up. Return it.

412
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,200
Am I looking at another day
of chauffeur duty?

413
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,000
- Team's almost filled.
- Not that it hasn't been fun.

414
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,900
Well, I do have one more spot.

415
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,100
Can you think of anybody
I might've overlooked?

416
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,700
This a game or a test, sergeant?

417
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,900
- Could be a bit of both.
- Yeah, I'm a little old for games.

418
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,900
All right.

419
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,200
So how'd you like to be
back on SWAT?

420
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
It's not gonna happen.

421
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,000
So why you hanging
around the cage then?

422
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,400
It's a job.

423
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,000
And SWAT's a calling.

424
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,200
Anybody around you for five minutes
can tell you still got the bug.

425
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,700
All you gotta do is say yes.

426
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,900
It's not up to me or you.

427
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,900
I got a history here.

428
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah, let's talk about that.

429
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,300
I heard some rumors
about you and your old partner.

430
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Did you give him up
in Fuller's office?

431
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,500
Because, you know, team members
gotta trust each other.

432
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,100
I'm not on your team.

433
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,900
And no, I didn't give him up.

434
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,400
You've been in that cage six months,
shining boots and fixing weapons...

435
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,300
...waiting for a second chance.

436
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,000
I got one, and I'm offering it to you.

437
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,400
Fuller will never sign off on it.

438
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,600
You let me deal
with that paper-pushing punk.

439
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
I want you on my team.

440
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Let me tell you, it's the sauce.

441
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,000
If you don't have the right sauce,
what do you got? You know?

442
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,000
My mother, she used to make sauce.

443
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,800
Now you go into the store,
and you buy it in a jar or in a can...

444
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Alex?

445
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Alex! Nobody told me
you were coming.

446
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,700
- When did you get here?
- Surprise.

447
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,700
Happy birthday, Uncle.

448
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Come on, sit down. Sit.
Bring some champagne, huh?

449
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,500
Sit, eat.

450
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,600
The chief's making me take you back.

451
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,100
He's concerned about losing
all his best officers.

452
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,700
- He thinks I'm one of his best officers?
- But...

453
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,600
...he's given me complete oversight.

454
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,200
And trust me,
you got no room for error.

455
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,400
So I will give you Boxer, T.J. McCabe
and this new guy...

456
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,900
...Deacon Kaye.

457
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,500
I have to pass on the other two.
Sanchez is a woman, and Street...

458
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Well, Street's on my shitlist.

459
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,200
Hey, I'm on your shitlist too,
and I'm the team leader.

460
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,100
You work for me now,
and it's my team to choose.

461
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,500
With all due respect, captain,
other leaders get to pick their teams.

462
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,000
And you can too.
Just pick two new people.

463
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,900
Look...

464
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,100
...just give me the team I ask for.

465
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,400
You can even call it
your shitlist team.

466
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
That way, if anything goes wrong,
you can put all the blame on me.

467
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,000
It'd be just like old times.

468
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,900
Okay.

469
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,700
Okay, you got your team.

470
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,200
But when you fail,
and you probably will fail...

471
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,500
...Sanchez goes back to Traffic,
and you and Street are plain gone.

472
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,700
No, not just off SWAT, off the force.

473
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,500
- You feel me?
- Oh, yeah.

474
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,600
I feel you.

475
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,800
- Okay, I'm leaving now.
- No, don't go.

476
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
I have wine and cognac from home.
Come on.

477
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,500
- I must go. I have a flight to catch.
- Oh, catch another flight.

478
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,200
Let me introduce you to Monica.

479
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,800
You like this knife?

480
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,300
This is my father's knife.
He gave it to me.

481
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,700
It's a beautiful knife,
and she's a beautiful woman.

482
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
Now, why don't you stay, have a
good time and go back tomorrow.

483
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,700
Listen, I'm running the business now.

484
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,900
I'm the new boss.

485
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,000
Don't joke with me, Alex.

486
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,400
And don't ever forget,
your father's running the business.

487
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,900
No, I retired him.

488
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,000
He never spoke of that to me.

489
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,500
That's because
he can't speak anymore.

490
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,800
You put your hand
in my father's pocket.

491
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,000
Not in mine.

492
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,200
If you take my money,
I'll take your life. Understood?

493
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,100
Mail it to me.

494
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,500
- Yeah!
- Smile!

495
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,200
Good evening.

496
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,400
May I see your license,
registration and proof of insurance?

497
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm a tourist, you know.
I'm visiting the U.S.

498
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,700
I have my passport if you want.

499
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Let me see it.

500
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,700
Whose car is this?

501
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,600
It belongs to my uncle. Why?

502
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,600
You got a left taillight out.

503
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,900
Hi, this is Bridget the Midget.

504
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,200
We're out here in front of the Key Club
on Sunset in beautiful Hollywood.

505
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I just wonder how you can
get inside of there.

506
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,700
Anyways, we're on Sunset Boulevard,
where anything could happen.

507
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Especially police harassment.

508
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,800
Hey, you guys, you're all pigs!

509
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,300
Is your uncle's name
Martin Gascoigne?

510
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,500
- Yeah. So we're okay?
- There's a warrant in that name...

511
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,800
...and I have to detain you
until we can verify who you are.

512
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,400
Sir, please step out of the vehicle.

513
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,200
- You're here awful early.
- Traffic was lighter than usual.

514
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,400
Streets must've been
damn near empty.

515
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,900
Ali's his sister.

516
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,000
And I called bottoms on the last one.

517
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,400
You called bottoms,
but that's not what you got.

518
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,300
- Yo, dog, what's up?
- What's happening?

519
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,400
- Jim.
- Boxer.

520
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,900
So, what did you do to my sister?

521
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Nothing.

522
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,100
That's not what I heard.

523
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,500
I mean, that's not the word
on the street.

524
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,000
She's all broken up over you.

525
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,500
- Don't know why. She left me.
- Dumped.

526
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,500
A case of crabs
will do that to a woman.

527
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,900
Is there something about this team
I need to know?

528
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,100
I want to know
what an asshole like you...

529
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
...did to my little sister
to make her leave.

530
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,400
She's 28, all right?

531
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,100
And trust me, she's not so little.

532
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,700
- Trust you?
- No, you didn't.

533
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,400
How's your last partner doing?
Gamble. He trust you too?

534
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,800
- You wanna talk about this?
- You gonna tell me?

535
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,700
Been on your chest
for a while, yeah?

536
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,200
Street!

537
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,400
You wanna talk about it?

538
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Come here.

539
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,000
- Don't talk about what you don't...
- Yo!

540
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,100
Street! It's not worth it.

541
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
Who else you gonna narc on?

542
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,900
Who are you?

543
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,900
Who the hell are you?

544
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,900
Guess you're not the prettiest
one here anymore, huh, T.J.?

545
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Well, sounds like you've all
gotten acquainted.

546
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,700
Let's get started.

547
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,700
I'll make this simple.

548
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,700
L.A.P.D. SWAT is the most honored,
most respected...

549
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
...and most professional
police division in the world.

550
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,300
Go, go, go!

551
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,600
- Police!
- Police! Police!

552
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,800
That ain't gonna get it.

553
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,300
Bang.

554
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,100
Sanchez.

555
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Money.

556
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,500
Oh, man.

557
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
That sucked.

558
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,900
- What's up, Sanchez?
- You all right there?

559
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,800
When you're done with that one,
I got one for you.

560
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,300
T.J.'s sitting on two pair.
Looking for the boat.

561
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,100
Got it.

562
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,300
Street, you got three aces.

563
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
Need one to take T.J. Out.

564
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,000
Got a winner, winner!

565
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,100
All right, Deke.
Let's see what you got.

566
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,000
Ten of spades. Spade flush.
Not good enough.

567
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,100
Hondo, isn't that a straight flush?

568
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,300
Hold the phone.

569
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,500
Six, seven...

570
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,400
...eight, nine, ten of spades!
Straight flush.

571
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,000
Deke!

572
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,100
Beats four aces in Compton any day.

573
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,100
I think it works in Orange County too.

574
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,700
Sure you're right.
Good work, guys.

575
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,000
Police! Police!

576
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Clear.

577
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,700
- Clear.
- Clear. Go.

578
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,000
That's right.

579
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,900
SWAT is a life-saving organization,
not a life-taking one.

580
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,000
That's why the FBI and Secret Service
come here to train with us.

581
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,400
Smooth, Deke.

582
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,900
I guess if I was deaf,
I wouldn't know you were here.

583
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,700
But while you're laughing, there's
lots of people that want us to fail.

584
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,800
Get it right.

585
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,400
- Clear.
- Clear.

586
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,000
Clear.

587
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,600
Suspect, put your hands
on your head and come out.

588
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,300
- Come out!
- Come out now!

589
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,100
- Turn around.
- Go!

590
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,400
- Down.
- Get down.

591
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,200
Yeah.

592
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,000
Outstanding, guys.

593
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,200
You feel that?

594
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,400
The team's going out for beers later.
I'm buying.

595
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,800
I'll take mine after we pass.

596
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,300
Well, Fuller's definitely
gonna try and hose us.

597
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,300
Good. I'd hate to break a sweat
just for a first-round knockout.

598
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,300
Hey, we got a big day tomorrow.
Save some.

599
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,900
I got plenty.

600
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,800
I'm depending on you
to get these guys through this.

601
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
I'll cover my end.

602
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,700
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, go for it.

603
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,200
Why'd you pick me?

604
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,300
To piss off the captain.

605
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,600
All right, here's the scenario.

606
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,600
There are six hijackers
armed with handguns and knives...

607
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,600
...in control of that plane.

608
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,800
They've killed one hostage
and are threatening to kill the others...

609
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,300
...unless they get a pilot and fuel
within the hour.

610
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,800
There'll be SWAT officers
disguised as hostages.

611
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,600
Other SWAT officers
will be playing the roles of terrorists.

612
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,300
And they will be trying to kill you.

613
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,500
Staff sergeants will be grading us.

614
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,700
Couldn't give us the bus, huh, Hondo?
They always give us the bus.

615
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,300
- Fuller's really got it in for us.
- You think?

616
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,600
Another thing.
There are two dynamic entry points.

617
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,300
One here beneath
the front landing gear...

618
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,000
...one back here
by the baggage compartment.

619
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,400
I'm sure Fuller's got surprises
at both those entrances.

620
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,500
We get bogged down anywhere,
we fail.

621
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,700
Any ideas?

622
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
There's another way in, Hondo.

623
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,900
There's an elevator shaft
where they bring in the service carts.

624
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,200
And there's a mechanic's access
right here.

625
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,400
- Man, that's gonna be tight as hell.
- Yeah.

626
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,400
How many men can we fit in there?

627
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,300
Men? None.

628
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,000
All right.

629
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,100
Work this out.
Get in there and break Fuller's heart.

630
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,300
- Okay.
- What do we got?

631
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,800
- Toy guns.
- Toy guns, sir. Toy guns.

632
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,300
- Let's do this.
- All right.

633
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,400
Shame you're not playing a terrorist.

634
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,200
I'm supposed to be in first class.

635
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
We got camera three going up.

636
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,600
Three is set.
Checked it out on the monitor.

637
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,700
- "Are you ready?"
- Oh, yeah.

638
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Okay, let's see what they got.

639
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,000
- How'd you know about this place?
- I've known a few stewardesses.

640
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,100
Just a few?

641
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,900
- Stand by. We got a device.
- Same here.

642
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,700
Disarmed.

643
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Set.

644
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,100
Here we go.

645
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,000
Three.

646
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Two.

647
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,600
One.

648
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Boxer, one down.

649
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,900
Down!

650
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,200
Damn.

651
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,300
- "Deke?"
- I got one down.

652
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,700
- "McCabe?"
- "I got one."

653
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,700
Sanchez, one down.

654
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,500
That's five. There's one more, guys.

655
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,200
There's a sleeper. Come on.

656
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,100
Come on.

657
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That'll be six.

658
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,900
- "Clear."
- Clear.

659
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,400
- Clear.
- Clear.

660
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,800
10-David, this is 70-David.
We are Code Four. All clear.

661
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,100
Oh, yeah.

662
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,400
Wow. Is that a new course record?

663
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,800
- Yeah.
- All right.

664
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,700
Good job, guys.

665
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,400
Damn.

666
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,400
Please, Pop, please.

667
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,900
- Yo, Sanchez.
- I'm in SWAT now.

668
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,600
Yo, Deke. Deke, is that you, man?

669
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Oh, my God, Deke.

670
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,200
- Tell me that ain't you.
- You were a butterball.

671
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,700
That's all in the past.

672
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,100
I ate here every day,
worked here every summer.

673
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,200
I ended up looking like Fat Albert.

674
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,300
I'm cool. Eating right
has me looking like this.

675
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,400
Man, put that away.

676
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,000
Hey, put that away.

677
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,900
Put another in for me.

678
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,600
Hey, yeah, break out your money.

679
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,900
- Work it, baby.
- I'll give you back change. Watch it.

680
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,500
Hey! So you're celebrating
without me, huh?

681
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,100
- Mr. Kaye, you're the master.
- Like son, like father.

682
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,900
- That was one kick-ass display today.
- That's what I'm talking about.

683
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,400
All right, but let's remember one thing.

684
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,900
If that was a real operation
and not a test...

685
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,200
...one of us would be calling
T.J.'s family...

686
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,700
...trying to explain
what went wrong today.

687
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,800
One casualty may be acceptable
by department standards...

688
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,800
...never acceptable by mine.
We clear on that?

689
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,200
Got you.

690
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,100
- Crystal.
- Yes, sir.

691
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,900
All right. Well, let's continue
celebrating tonight...

692
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,100
...but tomorrow, we're SWAT.

693
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,500
Nice.

694
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,300
I love you too.

695
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,900
Homeland Security, my ass.
They can't keep me like this.

696
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,000
I've been patient, day after day.

697
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,300
So tell me, what's going on?

698
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,900
This is the problem.
Your prints do not match your ID.

699
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,000
So they're running another check
through the FBI and Interpol.

700
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,000
Interpol, shit. Get me out of here.

701
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,400
- I'm doing everything I can.
- Do more.

702
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,600
This is easy.
Who do we have to pay?

703
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,200
You can't solve this problem
by throwing money at it.

704
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,700
Then who do we have to kill?

705
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,300
Come on, guys, it's only 11:00.

706
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,600
I got a babysitter for the first time
in three months.

707
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,500
- We've been up since 4:00.
- That's weak.

708
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,300
If I get home by midnight,
I might get me some.

709
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
T.J.?

710
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,000
I get home before midnight,
I'm finding some. Sorry, babe.

711
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,500
- Boxer?
- I know I'm not getting some.

712
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,300
If I don't get home soon,
my wife's gonna freak.

713
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,700
You guys suck.

714
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,500
You know how hard it is
to find a babysitter?

715
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,500
Yo, Street.

716
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,500
Did you pass?

717
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,800
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

718
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,000
- First round's on the house.
- Thanks, darling.

719
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,400
Anything but tequila, please.

720
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,600
- No?
- No.

721
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,100
- We did good today, huh?
- Yeah.

722
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,200
What's it like...

723
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,100
...the real thing?

724
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,300
It's faster. It's a lot faster.

725
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,600
You know that guy?

726
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,200
Used to.

727
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,000
Bye.

728
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,000
See you.

729
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,100
It's all yours, man.

730
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,400
- How you doing?
- Oh, man, I am good.

731
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,000
- Heard they took you back.
- Yeah.

732
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,800
This your girlfriend?

733
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,500
No. No, she's SWAT.

734
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,400
- She wha...?
- She's...

735
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,500
This is what it's come down to,
busting down doors with J. Lo?

736
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,500
You know, I didn't know
that they made bulletproof bras.

737
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,100
Is it just me?
You know, I didn't know that.

738
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
What they need to make
are bulletproof condoms...

739
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,600
...big enough to fit your big head.

740
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,100
Nice. Good, I like it.

741
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,000
This your girlfriend? Cute.

742
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,000
No, but you can be my bitch.

743
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Really?

744
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,000
No, man, leave it alone.

745
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,600
- Here we go.
- Leave it alone.

746
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,500
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm good.

747
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,000
Put it on my tab?

748
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,600
Hey, glad to see all that butt-kissing's
really paid off.

749
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,500
Say hi to Fuller for me.

750
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,500
What?

751
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,100
You should've let me kick his ass.

752
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,100
I just saved yours.

753
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,500
So you and this guy Gamble
were partners, huh?

754
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,600
So how long you got
the babysitter for?

755
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,200
Just because I bought you a drink
doesn't mean...

756
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,600
...you get laid tonight.

757
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,600
So, what does two drinks mean?

758
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,000
Do you want to come over
to my house?

759
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,600
That was easy.

760
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,500
It's my kid's birthday party tomorrow.

761
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,300
Tomorrow?

762
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,300
Kids, birthday parties...

763
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,600
I'm hosting a Tupperware party
tomorrow.

764
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,800
- You, Tupperware?
- Yeah, seals in the freshness.

765
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,600
Party's completely booked,
otherwise I'd invite you.

766
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Tomorrow, noon.

767
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,200
Central, open South Sally port.

768
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,900
All right, gentlemen, take a seat.

769
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,000
You may have won the battle,
but you lost the war!

770
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,800
- Dad, can I have some of this?
- Yeah, go ahead, get it.

771
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,700
- Can I have this too?
- Whatever you want. Get it, get it.

772
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,000
Look at that. A cop
who drinks French champagne.

773
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,500
That is just impressive.

774
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,000
I may work in the mud, but I certainly
like to play up in the clouds.

775
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,500
I thought you said you'd fix the sink.

776
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,500
This is Lt. Harrelson,
O lympic SWAT commander.

777
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,900
This is top priority. Patch me through
to all black and whites in the area.

778
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,400
- I gotta go.
- Kids, come on, come on.

779
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,300
- It's time to ruin Mommy's day.
- Okay.

780
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,000
But you killed in the soccer game!

781
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,800
Come on, don't just stand there!

782
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,000
Baby, I have to go play
cops and robbers.

783
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,400
Okay.

784
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,200
- Okay.
- I love you.

785
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,900
Me too.

786
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,800
Hey, guys, the reason
we are gathered on our God-given...

787
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,200
...much-needed day of rest
is we have a Polish hostage.

788
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,200
- So what if he's Polish?
- No, no. Means he's one of those:

789
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,400
"Anybody comes in,
I'll blow my head off" type of guys.

790
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,300
Negotiations aren't going well.

791
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,900
- They think he's off his meds.
- We've been lobbing gas.

792
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,100
This guy's still smoking cigarettes,
popping off shotgun rounds...

793
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,800
...out the front door.

794
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:14,000
I want a limo, a 12-pack
and clove cigarettes!

795
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,400
I say we go in the back,
hard with shields.

796
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,600
Negative. Guy says he has all
the doors and windows wired...

797
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,900
...with high explosives.
- Come on, Greg!

798
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,200
Look, Dan, you wrote the book.
I just read it. Any suggestions?

799
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,300
I got an idea.

800
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,200
Ready?

801
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,200
It's the damn robot aliens.

802
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,600
Down! Down! Down! Down!

803
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,200
- Down!
- Put your hands behind your back.

804
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,600
- Stay down.
- You know what?

805
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,900
I think he might be Polish.

806
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,300
Unbelievable.

807
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,900
- Like opening a can of sardines.
- It works.

808
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,000
Drop Fruit of the Loomski
in the A-car.

809
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,700
Damn, man, you need to be
selling that shit on eBay.

810
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
- No, I only got one.
- Split the profits 50-50.

811
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,400
Corner the market.
Break them down like a shotgun.

812
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,100
"The Polish Penetrator."

813
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,500
Hold on, sports fans. I just got a call
from Sheriff's. It seems we've been...

814
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,100
...holding a high-priority international
and didn't even know it.

815
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,500
- They want us as escorts?
- You're my new favorite crew.

816
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,400
Just get the prisoner
to headquarters.

817
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,800
This is 9-Tom King
transporting inmates to Superior.

818
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,800
We've got a black and white
signaling a pullover.

819
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,200
Roger that. What's your 10-20?

820
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,300
Hollywood and Wilcox.

821
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,400
9-Tom King, stand by
while we identify the black and white.

822
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,800
Roger.

823
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,500
"9"- "Tom King, there is a problem"
with one of your transports.

824
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
The unit signaling is probably
providing interception.

825
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,400
Can you read his patrol number?

826
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,700
Negative.
It's an L.A.P.D. Black and white.

827
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,500
Stand by while we confirm.

828
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,400
9-Tom King, this is 70-David.
What's your location?

829
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,800
"9"- "Tom King, do you copy?"

830
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,300
What about me, boss?

831
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,100
Let's go. Get these off.

832
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,300
"9"- "Tom King, there is a problem."

833
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,100
9-Tom King, do you copy?

834
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,000
There it is, on the right.

835
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,300
- "9"- "Tom King, do you copy?"
- This is 70-David.

836
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,500
We're Code Six with the bus
at Hollywood and Wilcox.

837
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,000
114, this is 70-David.
We're Code Four.

838
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,800
114, this is 70-David. We're
Code Six at Hollywood and Wilco x.

839
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,000
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

840
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,700
- Out of the car!
- Get out of the car.

841
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,400
- On the ground now!
- Get out of the car!

842
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,600
- Down! Down!
- Let's see your hands!

843
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,100
Freeze!
Put your hands on your head!

844
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,700
Hands up!

845
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,400
Hollywood, huh?

846
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,000
On the ground! On the ground!

847
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,200
Do not move!

848
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,800
Do not move!

849
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,100
Move again! Move again!

850
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,900
Drama in Hollywood today.

851
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,400
An explosive and deadly day in
Hollywood as a gun battle erupted...

852
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,300
... between armed suspects and
members of L.A.P.D. 's SWAT unit.

853
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,000
Details are still sketchy, but sources
tell us there were fatalities...

854
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,200
... including two Los Angeles County
Sheriff's deputies.

855
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,300
At 1:45 p.m. Today, a Sheriff's
Department bus was assaulted...

856
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,400
At 1:45 p.m. Today, a Sheriff's
Department bus was assaulted...

857
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,300
...by two suspects
armed with AK-47 s...

858
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,100
...in an attempt to break
out a jailed detainee.

859
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,800
We are awaiting the arrival
of Alex Montel...

860
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,500
...the international fugitive
wanted in over a dozen countries.

861
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,400
Montel is wanted on Interpol
warrants by more than...

862
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,000
...ten national governments,
including our own...

863
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,100
... in relationship to charges
of arms dealing, drug trafficking...

864
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,800
... extortion, smuggling, kidnapping
and over two dozen murders.

865
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,600
Domestic and foreign law
enforcement agencies...

866
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,200
... are already jockeying
to interrogate the man...

867
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,900
... one high-level White House aide
has dubbed simply "The Catch."

868
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,800
I will give $ 100 million
to whoever gets me out of here!

869
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,800
Let's go!

870
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,100
One hundred million dollars!

871
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,200
The family's legitimate business
in Europe and the Middle East...

872
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,800
... are rumored to be fronts for their
criminal activity throughout the world.

873
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,200
The family fortune is estimated to be
in the high hundreds of millions...

874
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,400
... if not billions of dollars.

875
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,400
I will give $ 100 million
to whoever gets me out of here!

876
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,800
- 100 million sound good to me.
- Hell, yeah.

877
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,600
Are we hot? We rolling?

878
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,300
We have limited footage
of the dramatic events this afternoon.

879
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,600
- "An offer of"...
- "One hundred million dollars..."

880
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,500
... to whoever gets me out of here.

881
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,300
The family's fortune is estimated
in the billions of dollars.

882
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,300
- "An offer of $ 100 million."
- Who does this guy think he is?

883
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,200
Hey, "ése", are you for real
or what, homes?

884
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,300
Hey, I'm talking to you, "ése"!

885
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,400
We've been looking
for this punk a long time.

886
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,700
Busted taillight brings him down?
That's amazing.

887
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,300
The plan is to have you escort him
to a federal prison out in the desert.

888
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,400
You may want to have press
photographers meet us at the facility...

889
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,500
...soon as my boys hand him over.
It's a hell of a story.

890
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,300
Yeah, we'll pass that request
up the ladder to D.C.

891
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,700
- Good.
- Gentlemen, at 1300 hours...

892
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,900
...an L.A.P.D. Helicopter will arrive
to transport the defendant.

893
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,700
Until we get him inside
a federal facility, he's our baby.

894
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Sgt. Howard, your team's
got the high ground.

895
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,100
- Yes, sir.
- Sgt. Hondo.

896
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,500
Your boys are gonna provide close
proximity protection for the prisoner.

897
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,300
- Copy that.
- Sgt. Yamoto.

898
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,900
You're gonna set up a perimeter
around Parker Center.

899
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,300
- I'm on it.
- Piece of cake.

900
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,400
Roger, 10-David,
we're coming out.

901
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,900
Okay, guys, let's get this frog
in the bird.

902
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,300
What's $ 100 million
six ways, Box?

903
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,400
Sixteen-something.

904
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,000
Man, I'd have floor seats at the Lakers,
put my kids through college...

905
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,900
...hire Halle Berry
as my yoga instructor.

906
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,300
- Match engine power.
- RPMs match.

907
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,400
Gear down now.

908
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,800
Cover!

909
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,200
We've been hit! We've been hit!

910
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,900
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Did anybody see where it came from?

911
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:43,600
- Hit second engine. Going down.
- Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!

912
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,100
Down!

913
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,300
Everybody okay?

914
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,000
- T.J., Sanchez, take the suspect, go!
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

915
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,800
70-David to 114!
We're coming in!

916
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,200
- Come here.
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

917
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,500
Jim! Jim! Street! Keep it together,
buddy. Keep it together.

918
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,700
- Keep it together.
- Shut up!

919
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,600
Knock it off. We don't have time
for your personal shit.

920
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
- Move him out. Let's move!
- Let's go.

921
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,700
Move!

922
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,600
You tell them we're under attack!

923
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,900
An L.A.P.D. Airship is down. How do
you want us to proceed at this point?

924
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,800
- What the hell happened?
- Somebody shot our bird down.

925
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,100
No shit. How?

926
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,000
My guess is big-bore rifle, .50 caliber.
Somebody who knows how to use it.

927
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,600
- We're at a whole new level here.
- So where the hell is the shooter?

928
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,000
I want this asshole out of here now.

929
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,200
Best bet's to keep him on lockdown till
we see who we're dealing with.

930
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,900
- Capt. Fuller?
- Yes.

931
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,500
I've got the chief of police
on the phone for you.

932
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,200
So now we're talking about my ass.

933
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,000
You draw up a plan, you execute it,
and do not screw this up.

934
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,100
Have it transferred to my office.

935
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,100
Can't believe how much grief that
frog's $ 100 million offer's bringing us.

936
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,500
You guys ready?
You know what you gotta do?

937
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,800
- Yes, sir.
- Where's T.J.?

938
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:42,800
I'm right here, Hondo. Sorry, man.
Had some bad Thai food last night.

939
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,700
- It's not sitting well with me.
- So are you good to go or what?

940
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,600
No, I'm good now.

941
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:50,800
Let's go make the captain
look like a hero.

942
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,000
- Be safe out there.
- Headed to the bird.

943
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,800
All right, we're moving out.

944
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,500
Let's load them up!

945
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,900
Time to go.

946
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,500
Put that on.

947
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,500
Marry me! Marry me, Alex!

948
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,600
Marry me!

949
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,300
Marry me!

950
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,300
Hey!

951
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
Come on!

952
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,600
Oh, shit. Hold it. Hey, come on now,
get out of the damn street!

953
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,800
Wait there. Come on now!

954
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,000
Alex, let's go!

955
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,900
Get down! Get down now!

956
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,000
- Get on the ground! Move!
- Keep your hands on your head!

957
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,500
- Hands up!
- Don't move!

958
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,600
I got him!

959
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,400
I don't know, talk to them.
Try to make it work.

960
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,500
Look, I've had enough problems
for one day, you know?

961
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,300
- Hey, where's Mike?
- Family emergency.

962
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,900
- Let me know if you need anything.
- All right.

963
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,000
Just try to get us there alive,
for starters.

964
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,700
- My sister's dating some new guy.
- Yeah?

965
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,300
Yeah, I met him for the first time
the other night.

966
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,100
Good for her.

967
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,000
Not really.
He's kind of a knucklehead.

968
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,500
You should give her a call,
you know, if you want.

969
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,100
All right, yeah. Maybe I will.

970
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,500
10-David to 70-David.

971
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,100
- Word our motorcade has been hit.
- Any damage?

972
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,400
- "Terry Fargas is dead."
- Damn!

973
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,300
And we've got two patrol officers
on the table at County.

974
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,200
- What's your location, 10-David?
- Right on top of you.

975
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,000
- That's good to know.
- Yeah.

976
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,200
T.J., stay alert back there.
They're coming out of the woodwork.

977
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,400
- American greed.
- Shut up.

978
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,900
- So reliable.
- Shut up!

979
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:47,300
Another officer's dead
because you shot your mouth off.

980
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,000
- That's how I like cops, dead.
- Want to join him?

981
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,600
He knew the dangers, no?

982
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,600
That's why he signed up
to be a police officer.

983
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,300
Carry a gun in the Wild West.
Like you, cowboy.

984
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,300
Would you be sitting here
if this job wasn't dangerous?

985
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,200
Anyway...

986
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,100
...killing him probably
got you 20 new recruits.

987
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,800
You should thank me.

988
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,100
Yeah, you're right. I should.

989
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,800
- Boxer, thank him for me, will you?
- Love to.

990
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,300
We are coming up
on checkpoint one.

991
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
Roger, Hondo, I see it.

992
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,300
Making the turn...

993
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,300
...at checkpoint one.

994
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,100
- Hardcore, Sanchez.
- I'm watching everyone's hands.

995
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,100
Empty hand, no weapon,
I'm going home to my little girl, Deke.

996
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,400
I'm going home to my brats too.

997
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,200
We're now approaching
checkpoint two.

998
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,300
T.J., relax, man.

999
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,800
Hondo transported the president like
this back in '96. No one had a clue.

1000
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,800
Hey, my friends.
I can double my offer.

1001
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,600
Sixty-six million for each of you.

1002
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,800
All you have to do
is let me go right here.

1003
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,800
And don't worry.
I'll find my way home.

1004
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,700
You got the cash?
Because we don't take a check.

1005
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,400
Come on. Be smart about this.
What do you make?

1006
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,500
Sixty-six thousand a year?

1007
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,800
Not even with overtime.

1008
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,300
Loser.

1009
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,700
Making the turn at checkpoint two.

1010
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,400
My view of Car Two
has been blocked.

1011
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,300
T.J., what's happening?

1012
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,300
I got a pedestrian in the crosswalk. I'll
be on your tail in about 10 seconds.

1013
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,800
Roger that.

1014
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,800
Hands where I can see them, guys.
Come on.

1015
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,300
- T.J., what the hell are you doing?
- What the hell does it look like?

1016
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,400
I'm taking Frenchie here
up on his offer.

1017
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,400
Now, you guys just be smart.
Hands up, Box! Come on. Come on.

1018
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,900
Hands up! Hands up, Box. Let's go,
let me see it. Hands up! Let's go!

1019
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,800
What the hell was that?

1020
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,400
- What was that, Bri?
- He was going for his piece.

1021
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,400
No, he wasn't! I had it under control!

1022
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,100
- You didn't have to shoot him!
- What do you say, Jimbo?

1023
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,300
- Want to be a cowboy?
- T.J., Street, Boxer!

1024
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,000
- "Car Two, respond!"
- We're catching up to you, sarge.

1025
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,300
- We'll be there in about...
- Officer down! 7 th and Hope!

1026
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,000
- Flip a bitch!
- Flipping a bitch.

1027
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,400
- 10-David!
- Move!

1028
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,300
10-David! Do you have a location
on car number two?

1029
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,000
- Move! Move! Move!
- Roger.

1030
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,300
Car Two is stopped at 7 th and Hope.

1031
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,200
Do me a favor. Tell Fuller
it was me who pulled this off, yeah?

1032
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,800
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this, Gamble.

1033
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,300
Well, you ain't got a say
in the matter, do you?

1034
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,600
Suspects wearing tactical clothing
and have automatic weapons.

1035
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,600
T.J., don't do this!

1036
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,800
I got an officer down! Officer down!
7 th and Hope!

1037
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,900
Suspects are entering
the Pershing Square MTA station.

1038
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:24,000
- Boxer, hang in there! Hang in there.
- You okay?

1039
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,200
I'm all right. Boxer got hit.

1040
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,400
We're gonna need an ambulance!

1041
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,600
- Who did this?
- It was Gamble.

1042
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,400
- Box!
- Get him up. Get him over!

1043
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,900
It was T.J. And Gamble.
They've gone down the subway.

1044
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,000
Let's go hunting.

1045
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,800
- I'm gonna get the kit!
- Take care of him.

1046
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,200
- Yeah.
- Street, let's go!

1047
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,200
This is 73-David. This is 73-David.
I need an RA unit...

1048
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,200
...as soon as possible
to the corner of Hope and 7 th.

1049
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,800
Officer down! I repeat, officer down!

1050
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,400
All right, T., we're in.

1051
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,100
Let's go.

1052
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,100
Hit the juice, grandpa.

1053
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,200
Come on, Box.

1054
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,500
Come on, come on, come on!

1055
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,700
- What do we got?
- Gunshot wound to the neck.

1056
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,400
- Vitals?
- None.

1057
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,600
Come on! Let's go!

1058
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,700
Always one step behind.

1059
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,000
This is 70-David at 7 th and Hope.

1060
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,600
Suspects are on eastbound train
number 5-0-7...

1061
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,100
...headed to Metro Center
at 7 th and Figueroa.

1062
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,000
Have the rail unit contact M TA...

1063
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,100
...and shut it down at the next station.
- Roger that, 70-David.

1064
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,700
What are they gonna do, take
the subway all the way to Mexico?

1065
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,400
Come on,
check for secondary wounds.

1066
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,300
Sanchez! Deke, Sanchez!
Meet that train at the next station.

1067
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,300
73-David, we copy.

1068
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
You better be good for it.

1069
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,900
I assure you, if anyone is, it's me.

1070
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,800
I want you to set up a perimeter.

1071
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,600
Nobody comes in the station
and nobody gets off a train.

1072
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,600
Yes, sir. You got it.

1073
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,600
Rail unit, this is 10-David. I've got my
men headed to the Figueroa station.

1074
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,800
- Are you ready to stop that train?
- "Yes, sir."

1075
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,400
- Where's this train?
- Never made it.

1076
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,900
Should've been here by now.

1077
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,600
Sanchez to Hondo.
The train never made it to Figueroa.

1078
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,900
Secure the station. SWAT's got it.

1079
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:27,500
Got people. Hands up!
Let me see your hands! Now!

1080
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,400
Hands. Hands!

1081
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,800
Hands. Show him your hands.
Hands.

1082
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,000
Where are they?

1083
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,600
- They said they were gonna kill me.
- They're not coming back.

1084
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,300
Down the shaft.

1085
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,100
Where'd they go?

1086
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,700
10-David, this is 70-David.

1087
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,500
Suspects have entered
what appears to be a storm drain...

1088
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,200
...approximately a quarter-mile
north of Metro Center.

1089
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,700
Roger that, 70-David.

1090
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,400
We'll deploy above ground
accordingly.

1091
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
We're going in after them.

1092
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,000
This shaft intersects
with the storm-drain system.

1093
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,600
They could pop out of any manhole
in a five-mile radius.

1094
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,600
- How many manholes are we talking?
- 6000.

1095
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,600
Six thousand?! I can't cover 6000...

1096
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,400
R-Commander, 10-David.

1097
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,400
Put that airship down
and give me...

1098
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:57,100
...a command post
at Sixth and Hope Street.

1099
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,800
And give me a landline, Code Two.

1100
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,500
70-David to 10-David.

1101
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,100
70-David to 10-David.

1102
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,800
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

1103
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
70-David to 114.
Do you read me?

1104
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,900
We got no reception
down here.

1105
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,800
Gamble wants us on an island...

1106
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,800
...he's got it.

1107
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,500
Stay alert, guys.

1108
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,900
They went this way.

1109
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,700
- "We have ID'd those suspects."
- Great! Who are they?

1110
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,300
Former Officer Gamble
and Officer T.J. McCabe.

1111
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,000
Gamble, as in Street's
ex-partner Gamble?

1112
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,700
Roger.

1113
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,600
There is some kind
of plan here, right?

1114
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,100
There's your plan, pumpkin.

1115
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,900
We have got two SWAT-trained
guys leading this attack.

1116
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,800
How do we know the rest
aren't in on it?

1117
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,000
Because I can vouch for Hondo.

1118
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,900
Willing to bet $ 100 million on that?

1119
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,800
Bingo.

1120
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,300
You gotta be shitting me.

1121
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,400
If they're good, this is only gonna
slow them down, T.J.

1122
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,900
This was supposed to be simple
snatch and extract.

1123
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,800
- Boxer was a threat.
- He was my friend!

1124
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,300
- He was mine too!
- Stop crying, you can buy new friends.

1125
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,800
Don't give me any more reasons
to kill you.

1126
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,800
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1127
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:18,500
You should relax a little bit, my friend.
I'm the money here. Don't forget it.

1128
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,900
We don't have time for this shit.

1129
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:25,300
Look, you can go ahead.
I know this sucks.

1130
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,900
Let's worry about it in paradise,
all right?

1131
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,200
Come on.

1132
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,700
Have we re-established
contact with Hondo?

1133
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,700
Not yet, sir. 70-David,
advise your location, please.

1134
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,500
70-David, come in.

1135
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,300
Hondo, where the hell are you?

1136
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,200
What's that?

1137
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,700
- It's phosphorescent paint.
- Oh, yeah?

1138
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,300
Keep your eyes on the wall
for more.

1139
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,900
- Gas masks?
- It's just smoke.

1140
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,500
We're gonna have to go in blind.

1141
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,100
What's going on?

1142
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,000
Tripwire. Live mine.

1143
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:10,100
- Whoa, claymore. Nasty stuff.
- No shit.

1144
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,000
There's an old Indian saying:

1145
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,800
Where there's one white man...

1146
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
There's more white men.

1147
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,300
What? Do you hear something?

1148
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,700
No. That's the problem.

1149
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,300
Come on, we gotta move.

1150
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,000
- You all smell like shit.
- That would be a sewer.

1151
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,600
- Where's our air?
- On track and on schedule.

1152
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,400
Wonderful.

1153
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,700
T.J., ride with me.

1154
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,600
Come on, guys, gotta go!

1155
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,200
All units in the vicinity
of the Hawthorne Airport:

1156
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:01,200
Residents report beacon lights
turned on after closing hours.

1157
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,300
Dispatch, R-Commander.
Deploy all available units...

1158
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,700
...to Hawthorne Airport.
Call the FAA for details.

1159
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:09,700
They're gonna fly him
out of the country.

1160
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,700
10-David, this is R-Commander. Get
your men there as soon as possible.

1161
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,300
Roger that.

1162
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,300
Unit One, what's your status?

1163
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:21,000
We are approximately 45 miles
due east of Point Bravo.

1164
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,700
We have begun our descent.
That's a six-minute ETA.

1165
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,200
Roger that.

1166
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:43,900
- Ain't this a bitch?
- A cold, hard one.

1167
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,900
10-David to R-Commander, we are
approaching Hawthorne Airport.

1168
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:58,700
- Street! How about the claymore?
- Shit! I'll be back. Deke!

1169
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,400
10-David to R-Commander.

1170
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,700
We have established a perimeter
around the airport.

1171
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,800
Additional SWAT units
are en route.

1172
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:49,400
Van One, Van Two, you have
less than five minutes.

1173
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,400
Roger that, 10-David.
Any word from Hondo's team?

1174
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:59,700
- 70-David is still out of radio contact.
- Hondo, you son of a bitch!

1175
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,300
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1176
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,300
Remember when you asked me
what I used to do in the SEALs?

1177
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,300
Oh, yeah.

1178
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,800
All right, clear.

1179
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,600
Fire in the hole.

1180
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,700
10-David, this is 70-David.

1181
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,700
70-David, where the hell are you?

1182
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,500
We are somewhere around
Sixth and Trenton.

1183
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,500
We lost communication in the tunnels.
Where's our backup?

1184
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,800
Hawthorne Airport.
That's where your friends...

1185
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,600
...Gamble and T.J. McCabe
are headed.

1186
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,100
That's the other side of town!
Send a couple units to pick us up.

1187
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,700
Pick you up? For all I know,
you're in on this!

1188
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,800
- "I got a good mind to bring you in."
- Like hell. Come on, let's go.

1189
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,900
- Police! Stop the car!
- Stop the vehicle!

1190
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,500
- Stop the car!
- Stop the car!

1191
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,900
Stop the car!
Exit the car, sir!

1192
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,000
- You guys have to get out of here.
- Police emergency.

1193
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:20,200
- Wait, I just have kids in the car.
- Well, get them out of there!

1194
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,200
- It's us in the gun cage tomorrow.
- You know how it is, Street.

1195
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,800
Sometimes doing the right thing
ain't doing the right thing.

1196
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,800
- Last car through. Bridge is locked.
- Copy that.

1197
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,100
- I thought you couldn't drive.
- I said I didn't like to.

1198
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,200
Keep getting into accidents.

1199
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:56,100
Sounds like they're trying
to fly him out of here.

1200
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,700
Why would they turn on the lights
and warn everybody?

1201
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Shit! Gamble's smarter than that.

1202
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,900
There's a full moon. A rookie
could land on a night like this.

1203
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,400
- So why'd they pop up back there?
- I don't know.

1204
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,600
But Fuller's sending all we got
to Hawthorne.

1205
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,300
Did they build a new airport in
downtown in the past couple of days?

1206
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,400
I don't think so, Sanchez.
Why?

1207
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,500
That jet to your right, it's flying
pretty low, and it's only getting lower.

1208
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,900
- That's our boy! That's our boy!
- He's setting down.

1209
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,700
- Yeah, but where?
- I don't know, but follow that jet.

1210
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,700
- How wide is the Sixth Street Bridge?
- It's gotta be four lanes across...

1211
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,700
...sidewalks.
Plane small enough...

1212
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,500
...he might be able to set it down,
if he's got the balls.

1213
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,900
Reducing speed.

1214
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,500
This is 70-David. That plane's
not coming to Hawthorne.

1215
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,200
I gave you a direct order
to stand down, sergeant.

1216
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,900
And I would have, Tom...

1217
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:32,000
...except I saw a Learjet about to land
on the Sixth Street Bridge.

1218
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,000
- Give me 40 percent flaps.
- Forty percent flaps, check.

1219
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:40,200
Sir, we have reports of a low-flying
aircraft in the downtown area.

1220
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,100
- Where's the nearest backup?
- Five, six minutes.

1221
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:48,000
I don't think you're feeling me
on this, Tom. We're going in.

1222
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,000
Oh, God!

1223
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,100
- Reverse thrust.
- Roger that. Full brake.

1224
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,400
This guy's worth every penny.

1225
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:49,900
All right, let's turn this plane around.

1226
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:57,200
10-David, we just got a report a plane
has landed on the Sixth Street Bridge.

1227
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,100
They what?

1228
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,600
Let's mount up!

1229
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,500
All right, give me a car
downstairs now.

1230
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:18,500
- What? What's going on?
- Just got room for one of you.

1231
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,400
- I'm not going without my wife!
- Well then, don't.

1232
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,700
No! No, no, no. Richard!

1233
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,300
- Jesus Christ!
- Richard! Richard...

1234
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:28,800
Richard is gone,
so sit down and shut up!

1235
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:31,400
Twenty seconds!
See you in Margaritaville.

1236
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,800
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Please, just let me go.

1237
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,500
- Please, let me go!
- Shut her up!

1238
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:38,700
- Come on!
- Shut the hell up!

1239
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,900
Get us in the air.

1240
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,700
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's go home.

1241
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,600
Oh, look. They've got
their own airport security.

1242
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,700
You've got company!
Limo broke containment!

1243
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,000
All right, we got you covered, man.

1244
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:14,700
Just keep coming.

1245
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,500
Boom.

1246
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,300
Son of a bitch!

1247
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,100
Here.

1248
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,100
- What's this?
- Well, that'd be a cell phone.

1249
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,800
That's the account where
I want the money transferred.

1250
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,900
The bank verifies the transfer,
goddamn if you ain't a free man.

1251
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:47,300
70-David, be advised
there are hostages onboard.

1252
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,100
All right, you heard the man.

1253
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,800
- Deke!
- Yo!

1254
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,500
They get that plane off the ground,
those hostages are dead.

1255
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:56,600
I need your A-game,
boys and girl.

1256
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:08,000
- What's going on?
- Get them off our asses!

1257
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,800
Just fly the plane. Open the hatch.

1258
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,000
- Come on!
- Open the hatch!

1259
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,500
Hang on!
Here's where watching...

1260
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:28,100
... The World's Most Exciting
"Police Chases" pays off.

1261
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,500
I got no shot!

1262
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,000
Get this thing in the air!

1263
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:40,500
Come on!

1264
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,300
Shut that goddamn door!

1265
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,700
- Damn it!
- I hope you got a plan B, brother.

1266
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
You stay there. You're fine.

1267
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:57,600
- Gamble! Let her go!
- Take a shot, Jimbo!

1268
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,000
- Sanchez is down!
- Sanchez.

1269
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,200
Go get him.

1270
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:16,900
Give me more ammo!

1271
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,100
Deke! Frog's running!

1272
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,600
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right, man.

1273
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,500
- Sorry, ma'am. I gotta go too.
- No.

1274
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,000
Tell Daddy how you want it.

1275
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
You're like a goddamn rash!

1276
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:31,300
You might want to
get that looked at, brother.

1277
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,900
- How's Boxer?
- What do you care?

1278
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,200
Come on, Hondo. Just give me that.

1279
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,600
He's gonna make it.

1280
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,000
Good.

1281
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,700
Just couldn't resist, could you?

1282
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,800
So, what do you want to do?

1283
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,500
Goddamn it, sarge.

1284
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,800
There's one in the chamber, partner.

1285
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,700
Come on.

1286
01:49:00,900 --> 01:49:03,200
- So how's Boxer?
- Got word he's gonna pull through.

1287
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,200
That's great.

1288
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,800
Remind me to buy
some shares in KEVLAR.

1289
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:11,000
Good work, Sanchez.

1290
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,900
You look like you need a Band-Aid.

1291
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,500
Somebody else
needs a body bag downstairs.

1292
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,900
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1293
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:23,000
- Good stuff.
- Nice job.

1294
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,500
Don't sound so happy.

1295
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:30,100
Still got a problem.
He's still here.

1296
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,000
Road trip?

1297
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,700
- Road trip.
- Yeah.

1298
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,300
Road trip. Guess you'll
have to fire us later.

1299
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,400
Transferring custody
of L.A. Police Department prisoner...

1300
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:01,000
...number 109672
into federal custody.

1301
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:04,300
Thank you, sir.
I will accept the transfer.

1302
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,500
Enjoy your new home.

1303
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,400
Try your best
to get to know the guys.

1304
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,500
Yeah, 100 mil ought to buy you
a nice husband in there.

1305
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,400
Where to, boys?

1306
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,500
Home sounds like a winner.

1307
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:55,000
Girls like you get guys
like me in trouble.

1308
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:58,200
You think I should've taken
the 100 million?

1309
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:02,200
All units, we have a 211 in progress
at the Diamond Mart...

1310
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,800
... 43 S. Hope Street.
Shots fired.

1311
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,800
Technically, our watch
has been over for 12 hours.

1312
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,700
So?

1313
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,500
Yeah.

1314
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,800
What the hell.
