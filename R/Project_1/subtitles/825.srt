1
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,032
<i> Seattle Today!</i>

2
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,043
<i> I am the captain
of the Pinafore!</i>

3
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,253
<i>And a right good captain too!</i>

4
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:32,963
<i>You're very, very good but...</i>

5
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,133
It's almost ready, you guys.

6
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,929
We'll be right down.

7
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,226
<i>...occasionally say...</i>

8
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,102
<i>I'm never, never sick at sea</i>

9
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,646
<i>- What never?
- No, never</i>

10
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,483
<i>- What, never?
- Well, hardly ever!</i>

11
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,880
Michael!

12
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,507
Emma, stay right there.

13
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,970
What's the matter?

14
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,848
Claire, stay here.

15
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,643
Mommy?

16
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,364
Hey!

17
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,701
- Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

18
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,286
What are you doing here?

19
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,871
- Mommy?
- It's okay, sweetheart.

20
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,137
This gentleman says
the Better Way Society sent him.

21
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,763
Better Day.

22
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,182
- Sorry. Better Day Society.
- Yeah.

23
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,102
Yeah. The Better Day Society
helps place

24
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,896
the mentally disabled with employment.

25
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,028
I live there.

26
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,781
Of course!
You're here to build the fence.

27
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,450
Yeah.

28
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,368
I tried knocking.

29
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,370
Solomon, right?

30
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,081
Rene Peterson told us
about the work you did.

31
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:35,085
I'm Claire
and this is my husband, Michael.

32
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,631
- Yeah, we met outside.
- And this is Emma.

33
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,633
Hello.

34
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,304
It's nice to make your acquaintance,
Emma.

35
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,974
I'm gonna throw some shoes on,
show Solomon around outside.

36
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,353
See if our guest would like
anything to drink. Okay?

37
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,189
My mom says to ask
if you want anything.

38
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,609
I'd like a brand-new bicycle

39
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,572
with a big basket on the handlebars
and some gears.

40
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,866
That sounds neat.

41
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,706
Okay, okay. I see.

42
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,337
You wanted to take away this?

43
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,714
Yeah.

44
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,383
Yeah.

45
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,385
The new fence should contain
the whole area here,

46
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,054
and the gate should be right there.

47
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,061
Do you want the fence

48
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,354
to keep people in,

49
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,566
or keep people out?

50
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,404
Well, both.

51
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,657
But mostly, it should keep people out.

52
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,743
Okay.

53
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,453
Okay.

54
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,415
One,

55
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,333
two,

56
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,627
three,

57
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,670
five,

58
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,547
nine.

59
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,969
Just kidding.

60
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,893
I got a tape measure. See?

61
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:19,022
All right. Is everything all right out here?

62
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,528
Right as rain.

63
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,034
- Mrs. Bartel?
- That's me.

64
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,828
The doctor will see you now.

65
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,039
This is your first exam with Dr. Mott?

66
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,791
Yes, it is.

67
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,043
The doctor who delivered
my little girl retired.

68
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,172
Dr. Mott was kind enough
to take me on midterm.

69
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,550
He's one of the best.
Expecting his own, you know?

70
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,885
Really?

71
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,804
Take everything off,
put the gown on, open at the front.

72
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,889
Okay.

73
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,560
Doctor.

74
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,021
Mrs. Bartel!

75
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,064
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Mott.

76
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,734
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

77
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,321
So, how are we today?

78
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,406
Just great.

79
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,576
The baby's kicking up a storm all day.

80
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,413
This is your second child.
You're a pro at this, aren't you?

81
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,459
I see you have a history of asthma.

82
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,294
- Any problems?
- No, none at all.

83
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,421
Why don't we take a look? Feet up.

84
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:25,881
Okay.

85
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:29,510
I didn't think it was usual to give
pelvic exams after the third month.

86
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:33,138
We won't again until the 36th week.

87
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,266
But I want to make sure my new patients

88
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,144
have a full exam on their first visit.

89
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,941
It's Mrs. Miller.
She's calling again for the test results.

90
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,278
Go ahead and give them to her.
She's all clear.

91
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,156
If she has any questions,
I'll call her back.

92
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,408
Would you hold, please?

93
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,620
Maria, when you're in the lab,

94
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,164
call in the results
of yesterday's ViraPaps.

95
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,083
Yes, Doctor.

96
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,088
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

97
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,840
Why don't we start
with the breast exam?

98
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,307
Weather's been beautiful these days,
hasn't it?

99
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,477
It has. Yeah.

100
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,398
I love taking walks after the rainstorm.

101
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,674
It's very important to be able
to give yourself your own breast exams.

102
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,055
Relax.

103
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,045
Mrs. Bartel, we need to schedule
your next appointment.

104
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,020
- Claire?
- Michael!

105
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,564
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Michael.

106
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,111
Honey, what's wrong? Claire?

107
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,116
It was the way he was touching me.

108
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,619
He wasn't examining me. It was like...

109
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,457
He was getting off on it.

110
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,460
I mean...

111
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,172
What if I accused him and I was wrong?

112
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,299
Do you think you're wrong now?

113
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,344
No.

114
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,097
Then we have to file a complaint.

115
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,309
- Michael, I don't think I can do that.
- Claire, listen to me.

116
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,313
If we don't report this,

117
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,358
he's gonna do the same thing
to somebody else.

118
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,237
You have to trust yourself.

119
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,991
I don't think I can, Michael.

120
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,909
I think you can.

121
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,458
We'll go through it together.

122
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,212
<i> Even with food
and supplies flown into the area daily,</i>

123
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,632
<i>the aid is not reaching
many of the refugees.</i>

124
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,803
<i>Dr. Victor Mott, Seattle gynecologist
and obstetrician,</i>

125
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,682
<i>was brought up today on charges
by the District Attorney's office.</i>

126
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:49,519
<i>The scandal began last week
when one of Mott's pregnant patients</i>

127
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,104
<i>went to the state medical board,</i>

128
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:56,067
<i>claiming she was sexually molested
by the doctor during an examination.</i>

129
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,530
<i>Since the patient's initial accusation,
four more women have come forward</i>

130
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:05,285
<i>alleging that they, too,
had been sexually molested.</i>

131
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:09,039
<i>Citing the possibility of criminal
misdeeds, the state medical board</i>

132
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,208
<i>turned the case over to the
District Attorney's office.</i>

133
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,920
<i>Dr. Mott was unavailable for comment.</i>

134
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,651
<i>The suicide provision is quite clear.</i>

135
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,945
However, we may be able to get
the insurance company

136
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,197
to return a small settlement.

137
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,408
Mrs. Mott, although your husband
had sizable assets,

138
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,203
they've been frozen by the state.

139
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,746
Frozen.

140
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,957
This is normal procedure
when the estate

141
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:56,086
is probably going to be sued
by a number of sources.

142
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:59,631
You are free to stay in the house
until you have your baby,

143
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,425
but you should begin
to make alternative plans.

144
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,971
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Mott.

145
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,269
Can I help?

146
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,456
Get an ambulance here right away!

147
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,375
My baby-

148
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,175
We'll need blood.

149
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,804
Four units cross-matched now!

150
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,473
- I want vital signs!
- Pediatrics is standing by.

151
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,684
- My baby.
- Now lift.

152
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,771
She's hemorrhaging.
Get this baby out or we'll lose them both.

153
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,108
- I feel it kicking.
- You can?

154
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,237
Keep her still.

155
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,158
Can't stop this blood. Call Anesthesia.
I'm gonna operate.

156
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,243
Chest compressions are reducing.

157
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,495
We're losing him!

158
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,832
No!

159
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,506
Hold her down.

160
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,009
- He's gone.
- No.

161
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,386
Anesthesiologist is on the way.

162
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,682
Increase the drip to 90.

163
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,726
Her pressure is 80 over 40.

164
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,272
- She didn't touch it.
- Emergency hysterectomy.

165
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,817
She's been so depressed,
she won't talk. Let me try.

166
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,071
<i>...against the late
Victor Mott's estate.</i>

167
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,783
<i>The suits were filed by four women
who claim they had been molested.</i>

168
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,368
You have got to eat.

169
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:55,455
<i>The investigation was dropped
when Dr. Mott was found dead</i>

170
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,375
<i>from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</i>

171
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,627
<i>Claire Bartel has not filed a suit,</i>

172
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,379
<i>although she was the first
to accuse Mott</i>

173
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,422
<i>of molesting her during an exam.</i>

174
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,300
I'll leave your food.

175
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,220
<i>Her accusation prompted
the other women to come forward</i>

176
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,408
I'm coming up to the back door.

177
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,077
I'm getting close to the back door.

178
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,248
I am now entering the back door.

179
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,166
Good morning, Solomon.

180
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,584
Good morning.

181
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,671
Thank you.

182
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,550
Hi, little baby.

183
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,677
Get back here. I got you!

184
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,015
Sorry, Mom.

185
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,601
Don't cry, baby.

186
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,979
Yes, that's a big boy.

187
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:05,108
Thank you, Solomon.
Don't cry, sweetheart.

188
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,694
Remember the rule
at the Better Day Society?

189
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,779
They said it's best
if you didn't handle the baby.

190
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,449
I'm sorry. I forgot.

191
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,911
- I only wanted to help.
- I know you did. Thanks.

192
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,795
They're replacing the greenhouses
at the botanical gardens.

193
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,299
- I might get one of the frames.
- Let me guess.

194
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,718
You want to build your own greenhouse.

195
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,222
Yeah!
The frame's there, the hardware's there.

196
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,060
All I'd have to do is erect it
and replace the glass.

197
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,482
Honey, don't you think
you're taking on too much?

198
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,193
Have you given any more thought
to hiring a nanny?

199
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:52,155
I'm not comfortable
having any of the girls I interviewed

200
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,239
take care of Joey.

201
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,077
Claire, it's not like when we had Emma.

202
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,496
You don't need to do
everything yourself.

203
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,791
What about Solomon?
He could be our nanny.

204
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,462
Honey, I don't think Solomon
would make a very good nanny.

205
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,172
Why not?

206
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,507
Remember we had the talk

207
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,509
about what a special person
Solomon is?

208
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:13,843
Yeah.

209
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,597
Well, there are some things
that he can't do.

210
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:23,311
What's gonna happen to Solomon
when he finishes painting the trim?

211
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,021
Well,

212
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,273
when he finishes painting the trim,

213
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,527
I guess we'll have to find
something else for him to do.

214
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,612
Okay?

215
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,072
Okay.

216
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,407
Hurry up, sweetheart.

217
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,369
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

218
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,417
Mrs. Thompson?

219
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,044
Mrs. Thompson!

220
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,517
Thanks.

221
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,603
- Thanks for stopping.
- No problem.

222
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,023
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

223
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,986
Thanks. I think it's gonna rain later.
That was nice of you.

224
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,239
- You're welcome.
- Well, thanks. Thank you.

225
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,450
Excuse me, do you know
where the Bartels live?

226
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,244
Well, I'm Claire Bartel.

227
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,873
- Hi. I'm Peyton Flanders.
- Hi.

228
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,000
I was coming about the nanny position.

229
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,086
All right.
You wanna come up to the house?

230
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,504
Yeah.

231
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,758
I can't believe I forgot
I had an appointment.

232
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,303
I'm usually so good about these things.

233
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,014
Actually, I didn't have an appointment.

234
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,142
Did the agency just tell you to stop by?

235
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,853
Well, no. I'm not with an agency.

236
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,647
The truth is,
I've only worked with one family.

237
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,818
They're moving and I didn't know
what I was gonna do next.

238
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,448
I was with their little girl in the park.

239
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,576
Nannies talk and I heard
that your family needed someone.

240
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,124
I shouldn't have showed up.
I've made you uncomfortable.

241
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,711
No, it's fine. You're here, so come on in.

242
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,214
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

243
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:29,229
Usually I have a set of questions
I ask, like,

244
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,857
- "Are you old enough to drive?"
- Thank you.

245
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,992
Here. Don't lose this.

246
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,162
My husband's been after me
to fix this thing.

247
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,873
Well...

248
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,001
How did you come to be a nanny?

249
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,462
Well...

250
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,465
A few years ago, I was pregnant.

251
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:01,427
I lost the baby and my husband
within days of each other.

252
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,306
The miscarriage prevented me
from having more children.

253
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,599
It was a very difficult time.

254
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,728
A mutual friend set me up with a family
looking for a nanny.

255
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:15,775
It turned out to be a wonderful
experience for both of us.

256
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,568
I adore children.

257
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,364
I love being with them,
taking care of them.

258
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,116
For me,

259
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:28,204
it's the next best thing
to actually being a mother.

260
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,999
Well, I'm building my own greenhouse.

261
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,585
And although
I'll just be right in the backyard,

262
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,213
I'm anticipating being very busy.

263
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,387
That's Joe.

264
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,972
I'd love to meet him.

265
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,435
The nursery is across
from the master bedroom.

266
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,355
Claire? I need to ask you something.

267
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,525
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

268
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,104
<i> Try to open the window
from the inside.</i>

269
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,982
If you can't,
wait till Michael comes home.

270
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,693
Solomon, this is Peyton.
Peyton, Solomon.

271
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,446
- Nice to meet you, Solomon.
- Hello.

272
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,118
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

273
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,541
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,086
That's all right. It was an accident.

275
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,296
Anyone can have an accident.

276
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,135
Okay.

277
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,155
He's beautiful.

278
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,324
He's very hungry-

279
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,495
I've taken up half your morning.

280
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,497
No problem, I really enjoyed it.

281
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,084
I should be going.
I'm gonna leave a letter of reference.

282
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,503
I can show myself out.
You don't have to get up.

283
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,381
Peyton,

284
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,967
would you like
to have dinner with us tonight?

285
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,635
I'd love you to meet the family.

286
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,387
I'd love to.

287
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,681
Good. Say around 6:30?

288
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,182
I'll be here.

289
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,107
I'm in charge of the salad dressing.

290
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,110
And now you're in charge
of setting the table.

291
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,321
Daddy's gonna be home any minute.

292
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,907
What does your husband do?

293
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,076
Michael's a genetic engineer.

294
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,871
He works for a research outfit
called Biotechnics.

295
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,747
Daddy is a mad scientist.

296
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,752
It's Daddy!

297
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,676
- Here, let me help with that.
- Thanks.

298
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:31,304
Give me a kiss. Thank you very much.

299
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:35,266
Thank you very much.
You helping Mom out?

300
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,435
What are you shushing me for?

301
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,604
 Joey's asleep.
Thank you.

302
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:47,111
- Hi, beautiful.
- How are you?

303
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,911
Peyton, this is my husband, Michael.

304
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,078
Hi.

305
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,795
I gotta tell you guys, that was
one of the all-time great meals.

306
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,214
It was delicious.

307
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,925
I was in charge of the salad dressing.

308
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,054
That's right. She did.
She made it all by herself.

309
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,645
When Mom finishes the greenhouse,

310
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,439
- I'm in charge of the strawberries.
- Really?

311
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,943
- That sounds like a very important job
- It is.

312
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,285
She seems terrific. What's the catch?

313
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,580
There is no catch. I think she's great.

314
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,875
I think we can get her
to commit for a year.

315
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,795
- Let's grab her.
- Yeah? Okay.

316
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,008
Oh, my God!

317
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,346
- What happened?
- He had this in his mouth.

318
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:59,016
- Mommy's earring.
- It must have fallen out.

319
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,476
He's okay.

320
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,645
I'm sorry I frightened everybody.

321
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,607
- I'm glad you caught it.
- I'm glad you got there in time.

322
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,672
- Hi.
- Hi.

323
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,215
This is for you.

324
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,135
Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

325
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,432
That's very pretty.

326
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,518
They say a wind chime
helps a baby sleep.

327
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,104
Why don't we
get you settled downstairs,

328
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,440
then we'll hang it up
outside the nursery.

329
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,040
This is a little bit dark,
but your room gets more light.

330
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,586
This is the laundry room.

331
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,218
And this is your room.

332
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,598
It's perfect.

333
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,058
Like it?

334
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,316
 There we go.

335
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,783
Yes.

336
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,515
Mom, look! We did it.

337
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,393
Boy! Let's see.

338
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,608
- Emma, you can certainly shovel!
- Thank you.

339
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,360
How pretty!

340
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,240
It looks just like your house.

341
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:29,078
I know. We put it out every year
when the martins come back.

342
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,541
Who are the Martins?

343
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,418
They're large swallows.

344
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,171
The same family comes back
every year to visit us.

345
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,298
Yeah.

346
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,426
I would come back, too.

347
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,769
That is a beautiful bracelet, Claire.

348
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,730
I got that at an antique show.

349
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,234
- You can borrow it anytime.
- Well, thank you.

350
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,781
This must be a special occasion.

351
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,785
I always feel sexy and glamorous
when I wear this dress.

352
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,121
It's a present from Michael.

353
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,126
Okay, which shoes should I wear,
red or black?

354
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:21,630
- Are you wearing a jacket?
- Yeah. Well,

355
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,465
no. Maybe not.

356
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,594
- Then I'd go with the black.
- You think so?

357
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:30,848
Yeah, I guess you're right.

358
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,314
That's them. Now I'm really late.

359
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,692
- Where are you guys?
- Oh, we're running late.

360
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:44,945
- Does Marlene want to come in?
- Nah, she's on the phone.

361
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,450
Damn.

362
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,995
- What is it?
- It's a stain.

363
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:58,500
It's perfume oil.
I must have perfume oil on my hands.

364
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,462
- I'll go get some club soda.
- Thanks.

365
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,932
Marty, this is Peyton.

366
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,810
- Hello, Peyton.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

367
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,480
- I need to get something for Claire.
- Okay.

368
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,110
Maybe we should go ahead
and have kids.

369
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:33,619
I want to inform you
this place will not hold our table.

370
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,579
- Hello, Marlene.
- Hello.

371
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:39,208
What's with you?

372
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,877
What do you mean? Nothing's with me.

373
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,217
Nothing my ass.

374
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,553
Hi, I don't believe we've met.

375
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,932
I'm Marlene Craven.
You must be Peyton.

376
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,642
Nice to meet you.

377
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,394
- Poison.
- Excuse me?

378
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,397
The perfume.
You're wearing Claire's perfume.

379
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,733
Well, Claire needs me upstairs.

380
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,242
You look great.

381
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,085
- You don't think that's funny?
- No.

382
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,050
There she is.

383
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,845
- Hi.
- Sorry.

384
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,347
Hi. You look great!

385
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,851
I thought you were going to wear
that dress I got you.

386
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,729
Is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing?

387
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,524
That's not what I meant.
Boy, you look good!

388
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,694
- You look beautiful.
- Let's go. I'm starving.

389
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,822
You have the number where we'll be.

390
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,074
I do. Have fun.

391
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,285
Bye.

392
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,463
<i> Zombies.
The living dead.</i>

393
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:11,467
This is great!
Mom never lets me watch these movies.

394
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,762
That's why we have to keep it a secret.

395
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,639
Do you know what a secret is, Emma?

396
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,143
Yeah, something you can't tell anybody.

397
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,896
- No matter what.
- That's right.

398
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,524
Now we have our own little secret club.
That's our sign.

399
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,448
It was fun meeting
your Aunt Marlene and Uncle Marty.

400
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,159
They've known your mom and dad
a long time?

401
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,994
Aunt Marlene grew up with Daddy.

402
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:43,957
They were boyfriend and girlfriend
when they were little.

403
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,836
Is that right?
Do you have any boyfriends?

404
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,341
- No, I hate boys.
- You do?

405
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:57,554
If I tell you something,
you promise not to tell anybody?

406
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,265
I promise. Secret club.

407
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,687
Well, this mean kid at school,
his name is Roth,

408
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:08,023
he's been really mean to me.

409
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,818
But he said if I told, I'd be dead meat.

410
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,237
He said that to you?

411
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,906
Did your mother do anything about it?

412
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:19,076
She tried, but she couldn't help.

413
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:31,088
You never, ever let an attractive woman
take a power position in your home.

414
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,340
- It's bad business.
- A power position.

415
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:38,887
You heard what I said.
What's that saying?

416
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,099
- "The hand with the baby" that...
- Hey, Marl?

417
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,810
How much did you get
for the Fletcher house?

418
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,937
Three and change.

419
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,566
All I'm saying is watch your back.

420
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,903
I'm serious! There's too much pressure.

421
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:58,615
A woman can feel like a failure
if she doesn't bring in 50 grand a year

422
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,535
and still make time for blowjobs
and homemade lasagna.

423
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,248
Marlene's not much of a cook.

424
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,378
I think I'm gonna bum one of these.

425
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,426
You're such a bad influence.
He only smokes around you now.

426
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,221
- One isn't gonna kill me.
- Oh, I got it.

427
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:26,226
"The hand that rocks the cradle
is the hand that rules the world."

428
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,207
You want to look at the baby? Look.

429
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,626
Hi.

430
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,631
Look, honey. A boy or a girl?

431
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,884
A boy. His name's Joe.

432
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,802
How old?

433
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,971
Three months.

434
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:06,642
- He is beautiful.
- Thank you.

435
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,352
He has your eyes, you know.

436
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,815
Do you really think so?

437
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,901
Absolutely.

438
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,155
Do you have any other children?

439
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,951
Yes. He has a sister. Her name's Emma.

440
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,120
She looks more like her father though.

441
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,583
We have one more, too,
don't we, sweetheart?

442
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,928
- Peyton.
- Hi, Emma.

443
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,347
Tell me, which one is he? Where?

444
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,436
The one with the blue and gray shirt?

445
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,190
Okay.

446
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,374
- Watch it, trippy!
- Sorry, Roth.

447
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,543
My arm! My arm!

448
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:20,382
I got a message for you, Roth.
Leave Emma alone. Look at me.

449
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,676
If you don't, I'm gonna rip your head off!

450
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:28,890
- I get it, ma'am. Let me go!
- Don't forget it.

451
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,892
Awesome!

452
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,395
Wow, that was cool.

453
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,237
Secret club.

454
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,332
Good morning.

455
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:03,425
What's the matter?
You're not hungry, sweetheart?

456
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:11,475
Claire, I thought
you could use a cup of coffee.

457
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,726
Thanks.

458
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,771
- Peyton?
- Yeah?

459
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,607
Have you noticed
anything different about Joe?

460
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:21,526
No, I haven't.
Why, is something wrong?

461
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,823
No. I was just wondering. I'm real tired.

462
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:31,286
Michael was up all night finishing
his proposal. I got up at 4:30 to type it.

463
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,414
- I hope it works out.
- Good morning.

464
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:37,292
- See you tonight.
- You're not gonna have pancakes?

465
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,628
No, I've got to go to Federal Express.

466
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,048
Let me. That's the last thing
you need to worry about.

467
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,009
You have the time?
My proposal has to go out today.

468
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,887
Okay. Thanks. I love you.

469
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,972
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Michael.

470
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,654
How long
have you been volunteering here?

471
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,656
Gee, about seven years.

472
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,743
These days, I just take care
of the morning maintenance.

473
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,581
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi, Stan.

474
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,836
Like a big botanist family down here.

475
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,170
Yup.

476
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,049
We sit around talking about root rot

477
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:31,513
and drainage properties of shredded
bark and other fascinating topics.

478
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,687
Is your greenhouse
going to be something like this one?

479
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,858
Well, hopefully.
On a much smaller scale though.

480
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,902
I've always loved growing anything.

481
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,905
When I was little,
my parents thought I was crazy.

482
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,950
They thought I should've been born
on a farm.

483
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,707
Hey!

484
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,378
Hello.

485
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,505
Hello!

486
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,053
Do you have relatives in Seattle?

487
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,805
Oh, no, I don't.

488
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,184
My husband was my only family.

489
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,730
He's the only one
who ever really understood me.

490
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,566
He took care of me.

491
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,405
He was murdered.

492
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:33,867
Murdered?

493
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,580
They never caught who did it.

494
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,462
But I firmly believe
what goes around, comes around.

495
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,760
Is there a bathroom here?

496
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,971
Yeah, down through there
on the right side.

497
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,848
I'll be right back.

498
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:38,742
Come here, little one.

499
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,286
Do you need to be changed?

500
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,105
Come here.

501
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,609
 Michael's proposal.

502
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:14,402
I can't find it.

503
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,280
It was in your purse.
I saw you put it in there!

504
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,283
Claire, are you all right?

505
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,996
Asthma. I'll be okay.

506
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,464
Asthma.

507
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,935
Michael, it's just disappeared.

508
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:51,314
I've retraced my steps.
I spoke to the manager in the restaurant.

509
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,317
He said he'd call in the morning.

510
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:56,820
What did they say
when you called again?

511
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,239
They said they'd consider it
next quarter.

512
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,575
- But they said they'd consider it?
- Claire, come on.

513
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,452
We've been over this.

514
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:08,164
Look, everything is gonna be okay.

515
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,460
- Michael, I'm so sorry.
- I know you are, honey.

516
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,337
I know you are.

517
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:20,218
- Maybe I left it at the botanicals...
- I'm going to get back to work.

518
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,012
I'm sorry.

519
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,454
Michael, I'm worried about Joe.

520
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,164
Why? What's wrong?

521
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,959
It's his eating habits.

522
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,628
He's stopped nursing
the way he used to.

523
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,214
How long has this been going on?

524
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,259
It's not all the time. A couple of weeks.

525
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,011
- Did you call the doctor?
- Yeah.

526
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,679
What did she say?

527
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,849
She said it's fine as long
as he keeps gaining weight.

528
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,644
Well, I'm sure he's fine, honey.

529
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,192
Someone named Peyton
is here to see you.

530
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,903
- Peyton's here?
- She's in your office.

531
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,367
She's our nanny, Gilbert.

532
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,662
Okay.
Let me in on where you do your hiring.

533
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,498
Hi.

534
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,876
He's out cold.

535
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:41,966
Sorry to bother you at the office,
but I wanted to talk to you in private.

536
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,219
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yeah.

537
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,097
I just had an idea.
It's Claire's birthday coming up.

538
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:52,101
I thought it would be nice
to throw her a surprise party.

539
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,354
She's been feeling low lately.

540
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,731
Especially with this thing
with your proposal.

541
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,359
That's a good idea.

542
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,652
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

543
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,824
Do you think Marlene
would want to help out?

544
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:10,161
Help out? You kidding me?
She'll take over.

545
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,250
Maybe it's best not to tell her
it was my idea.

546
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,085
Why not?

547
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,046
I wouldn't want her to think
I was competitive.

548
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,799
About Claire's friendship.

549
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,135
You understand Marlene
pretty well already.

550
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,022
Good. So I'll be going.

551
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,276
Okay, good. I'm real glad you came by.

552
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,782
- Bye.
- Bye.

553
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,259
Solomon!

554
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,765
I want to show you my sculpture.

555
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,355
Okay.

556
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:05,818
Is that the head? Or is that the foot?

557
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,029
No, that's part of the fur.

558
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:14,160
Okay, I see.

559
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,205
That's a piece of art.

560
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,332
- I knew you'd see it.
- Yeah.

561
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,043
Yeah.

562
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,047
- Hi, Emma.
- Hi, Peyton.

563
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,548
Hi, Solomon.

564
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,551
Emma, go inside.
I've got to talk to Solomon.

565
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,178
- Okay.
- Okay.

566
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,729
Are you a retard?

567
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,189
No.

568
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,571
Did you like looking at me?

569
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,913
Did you like looking at me?

570
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,256
Don't fuck with me, retard.

571
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:17,765
My version of the story
will be better than yours.

572
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:28,067
I won't let you hurt them.

573
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,069
They're my friends.

574
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,409
I won't let you hurt them!

575
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,331
Boy.

576
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:57,972
Solomon!

577
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,310
Would you step inside for a minute?

578
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,233
Okay.

579
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:23,956
Surprise!

580
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:27,835
It's for you, big guy

581
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,425
I was in charge of picking it out.

582
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,223
You're my friends.

583
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,475
Oh, my.

584
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,649
You should've seen his face
when we gave him the bicycle.

585
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,192
Emma adores him.

586
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,490
Claire, there's something
that's been bothering me.

587
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,701
I feel a little awkward bringing it up.

588
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:07,375
I've been noticing some behavior
that I feel might be inappropriate.

589
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,419
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, "inappropriate"?

590
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,384
Something about the way
he touches her.

591
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,180
I'm sure you must've misunderstood.

592
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:26,978
You're right. Solomon would
never do anything like that.

593
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,398
It would be obvious
if Emma were keeping a secret.

594
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,654
- I'm sorry.
- No, please. It's okay.

595
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,245
<i> She's coming around.</i>

596
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,919
I love you very much, sweetheart.

597
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,923
You know that if anything happened,

598
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,718
good or bad,

599
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:01,095
you can tell me
and I would love you just as much.

600
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,265
- Do you know that?
- Yes.

601
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,311
We shouldn't have any secrets.

602
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,274
Secrets between people
who love each other aren't good.

603
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:17,111
What's the matter, baby?

604
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,238
Nothing.

605
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,370
You don't have to say.

606
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:44,722
Why can't I see through this glass?

607
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,308
It's fiberglass, a different kind of glass.

608
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,687
We put real glass in the ceiling
to let the sunlight through.

609
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,445
And this lets the air in so it doesn't
get too hot in the greenhouse.

610
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,450
Joe's intercom conked out,

611
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,911
and I couldn't find any batteries
in the kitchen.

612
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,121
Think Solomon's got some in his cart?

613
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,998
Well...

614
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,919
He's got everything else there.
Let me take a look.

615
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:03,110
 Sweetheart?

616
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,572
<i>Come away from the window, honey.</i>

617
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,369
<i>Emma?</i>

618
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,706
Come sit down.

619
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,220
Peyton.

620
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,691
But I don't understand.

621
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,486
Why did they take Solomon away?

622
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:48,406
I guess your mommy
didn't like Solomon very much.

623
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,990
I wanted to help Solomon,

624
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,119
but I was afraid
she'd send me away, too.

625
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,538
I hate her.

626
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,834
I bet your mommy
wasn't mean like mine.

627
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,087
I didn't have a mommy.

628
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,133
She died when I was very little.

629
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,510
Your mommy died?

630
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,847
Then who took care of you?

631
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:18,018
I had to take care of myself.

632
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:23,649
Peyton, if something happens
to my mommy,

633
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,568
would you take care of me?

634
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:28,821
Of course I would.

635
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,031
And your daddy, too.

636
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,367
I'd take care of all of you.

637
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,804
Last of the boxes.

638
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,567
Emma's going to be okay, Claire.

639
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,953
She's so different around me lately.

640
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,667
She's not my little girl. She's so angry.

641
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,879
And guarded.

642
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:29,256
I think

643
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:34,553
maybe she blames me
because I didn't protect her.

644
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,307
I don't think so, Claire.

645
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,743
Marlene wants to get together tonight
to make out a guest list.

646
00:58:57,785 --> 00:59:00,788
I'm not sure this party's
a good idea now.

647
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:05,084
We should go ahead with it.
Everyone could use some cheering up.

648
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:09,296
Especially Claire. You know
how she's been blaming herself.

649
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,299
Yeah, I think you're right.

650
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,427
Guess I just needed to hear it.

651
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:24,520
Thanks for lunch. I liked the part
where we picked up the fertilizer.

652
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,313
- Oh, you liked that?
- Oh, yeah.

653
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:28,899
Hi, you two.

654
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:31,235
- Can I take him?
- Oh, sure.

655
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,572
Hi, sweetheart. Hello.

656
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,492
- Let me help.
- He's getting so big.

657
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,203
He's a different kid every time I see him.

658
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:46,041
He's got a great set of lungs,
doesn't he?

659
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:49,503
- Oh, what's the matter?
- You want mommy?

660
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,131
- You want to go?
- What happened?

661
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,434
I don't know what got into him today.
Want me to try?

662
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,854
- Wanna go to Peyton?
- It's okay.

663
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,105
Yeah.

664
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,984
Yeah, it's okay, little one.

665
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,993
What is that annoying noise?

666
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,041
Wind chimes. A gift from Peyton.

667
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:30,836
Charming.

668
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,882
Well, I gotta go.

669
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,594
- Bye-bye. Thanks for lunch.
- Okay.

670
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:47,853
Marlene,

671
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,230
Peyton's making
one of her famous souffles.

672
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:52,107
Why don't you and Marty
stop by for dessert?

673
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,569
I'm showing the Fletcher house tonight.

674
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,529
Didn't you sell the Fletcher house?

675
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,825
Actually I did,
but the financing fell through.

676
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:04,662
I have to start all over. Bye. I'll call you.

677
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,121
Okay.

678
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,547
That smells great.

679
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:19,593
You know what they say.
Chocolate's a substitute for sex.

680
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:22,763
Chocolate's great,
but I don't know about that.

681
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:28,894
Guess you and Michael keep
those fires burning all the time, huh?

682
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,357
Well, we certainly
have enjoyed each other.

683
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,403
When we first moved into this house,

684
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,780
we christened every room.

685
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:41,532
- Really?
- Yeah.

686
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,832
Well, you know.

687
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:57,005
When you have a baby, you start to feel
tired and unattractive and fat.

688
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,803
I'm sure Michael is as attracted to you
now as he ever was.

689
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,597
A man never loses it for his first love.

690
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:09,143
But I wasn't Michael's first love.

691
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,436
No?

692
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,938
You'll never guess who was.

693
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,608
Marlene?

694
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:19,194
Am I right?

695
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,989
Yeah, how'd you know that?

696
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,159
Wild guess.

697
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:29,663
You know, it's a shame
Michael's not here. He's gonna miss it.

698
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,750
What's he doing so late
at the lab anyway?

699
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:36,837
That's a good question.
I'm gonna give him a call.

700
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,262
- Randy and Cecie.
- Dave and Loreeta.

701
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,766
- And Mitch.
- Mitch and the Harrisons.

702
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,518
- Oh, come on.
- They always invite us.

703
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,399
You got a light?

704
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,198
Can't find my lighter.
Marty's gonna throw a fit.

705
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:16,543
You know, I'm still not sold
on this whole surprise party thing.

706
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,339
- Because of Emma?
- And Claire.

707
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,717
She just hasn't been herself lately.

708
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,387
How's Peyton doing?

709
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,808
Boy, Peyton's been great.

710
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:32,893
Has she?

711
01:03:32,935 --> 01:03:35,187
I don't know what we would have done
without her.

712
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:46,949
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

713
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:52,746
- How was your night?
- Fine.

714
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,125
Yeah?

715
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,215
Michael, I called the lab.
There was no answer.

716
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,342
I was in a room without a phone.

717
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,014
Honey, come on.

718
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,309
I didn't mean to frighten you.

719
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:18,230
- You been smoking?
- No, I haven't been smoking.

720
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:19,982
One of the techs was.
Must be in my hair.

721
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,776
Michael, you never let
anybody smoke at the lab.

722
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,695
What is this, an interrogation?

723
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,197
- Well?
- Well, what?

724
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,159
It's been a long day.
I just wanna go to bed.

725
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:19,124
I heard something.

726
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,793
I dropped something.

727
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:28,634
Well, good night.

728
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,346
Can I fix you something?

729
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:37,476
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

730
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,105
I'm sure.

731
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,151
Good night.

732
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,879
Your mom and I want to talk to you.

733
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:09,424
The Better Way Society
is putting Solomon back to work.

734
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:13,720
- Better Day!
- Better Day, sorry.

735
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:18,225
Your mom and I want you to let us know
if you see him

736
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,769
around school or at the house.

737
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,855
You don't have to be afraid.

738
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:26,316
I'm not afraid of Solomon.

739
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,530
Peyton! Wait for me!

740
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,073
Peyton !

741
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,804
- Mrs. Bartel.
- Hi, Joe.

742
01:06:57,139 --> 01:06:58,932
Let's see. Three pants,

743
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:01,476
a dress, one shirt. Like starch?

744
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,688
Yeah, and this jacket here
kind of smells of cigarette.

745
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,190
I didn't know
your husband was a smoker.

746
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:08,942
He's not.

747
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,445
What's this?

748
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:16,158
Mrs. Bartel, your husband's
got a habit he's keeping from you.

749
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,439
Mommy, what's wrong?

750
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:13,131
Mom, let's go inside.

751
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,927
Go upstairs to your room and play.

752
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,470
But, Mom...

753
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,973
Emma, please! Go upstairs.

754
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,328
Claire?

755
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,289
Honey, what's the matter?

756
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,458
Michael.

757
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,545
How could you do this?

758
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:55,382
- What are you talking about?
- You've been lying to me.

759
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,594
- Honey, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down,

760
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:01,429
you son of a bitch.

761
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:06,309
You don't understand.

762
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,812
I understand
you've been fucking Marlene.

763
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,730
All right, Claire, that's enough!

764
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,067
There are people in there.

765
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,283
What are you talking about?

766
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,744
- Talking about a surprise party.
- Oh, my God.

767
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,748
Everybody's in there.

768
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,235
Surprise.

769
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:58,278
 Surprise.

770
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:38,568
Did you speak to Marlene yet?

771
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:39,861
No.

772
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,949
I can't seem to face her.

773
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:50,413
Michael, I can't go on like this anymore.

774
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:54,542
I can't say I'm sorry
any more than I already have.

775
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,096
I can't go on like this anymore either.

776
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,684
<i> I was thinking,</i>

777
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,853
<i>maybe we could go away
for a few days.</i>

778
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:18,483
<i> You mean,
Peyton and the kids, or just us?</i>

779
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,697
<i>No, I was thinking
just the family without Peyton.</i>

780
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,740
<i>You like having Peyton around.</i>

781
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:29,744
<i>I do, and then sometimes I don't.</i>

782
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:31,371
<i>You sound like you're turning on her.</i>

783
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,666
It's just... You know.

784
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:38,753
So many things have gone wrong
since she's been here.

785
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,298
You saying those things
are Peyton's fault?

786
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,674
No.

787
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,176
I don't know.

788
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,262
I just don't feel like myself.

789
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:50,724
<i>Claire, honey, come on.</i>

790
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,268
<i>Peyton's come through
in some very tough times.</i>

791
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:57,063
<i>I know.
We'll talk about it when we go away.</i>

792
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,733
<i>We'll go away, just the family.</i>

793
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:54,305
If there are any further services
that I might provide,

794
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,851
do not hesitate to call, blah, blah, blah.

795
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,521
These are all in the Magnolia District
in that price range.

796
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:05,442
Eastwind, Hobart. These are old.

797
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,862
They still haven't unloaded
the good doctor's house.

798
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,573
Waiting for a tip?

799
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,925
- Cancel my morning.
- What should I tell Lambert?

800
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:33,553
Make something up.
You've got a Harvard education.

801
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:46,107
Hi, sweetheart. I'll be back in a while.

802
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,401
You're not working here?

803
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:52,197
No, I have to go to the botanicals
to pick up seedlings. I won't be long.

804
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,067
Fucking A.

805
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:41,788
Hello?

806
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:43,498
Let me speak to Claire.

807
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,124
May I ask who's calling?

808
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,502
Marlene Craven. Want me to spell it?

809
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,172
Claire's not here.

810
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,383
<i>- I'll tell her you called.
- Sure you will.</i>

811
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,598
What is this, a parade? Let's go!

812
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,451
Claire, I didn't know you were here.

813
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,204
Marlene called, said it's important.

814
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:24,998
Oh, okay, thanks.

815
01:16:54,402 --> 01:16:55,945
Hello, Marlene.

816
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:01,993
Claire! It's Marlene! Claire!

817
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,455
- Marlene, is everything all right?
- No.

818
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:09,417
I need a doctor. Know of any, Mrs. Mott?

819
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:13,296
Where's Claire?

820
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:21,095
Marlene, please?

821
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,555
Where is she?

822
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,392
She's in the greenhouse.

823
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,064
But, please, Marlene,
please don't go out there.

824
01:17:32,774 --> 01:17:36,277
Claire! This is important!

825
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:38,613
It has nothing to do with the party!

826
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:40,239
Claire!

827
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:42,909
Claire!

828
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:58,461
This little piggy stayed home.

829
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,838
This little piggy had roast beef.

830
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,882
This little piggy had none.

831
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:54,934
<i>911 emergency.</i>

832
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,395
Here's the O2.

833
01:23:04,105 --> 01:23:06,148
This isn't going to work.

834
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:09,276
Get me my laryngoscope
and a number five line right away.

835
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,406
- What happened?
- Paramedics are with her now.

836
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,199
What happened?

837
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:20,079
Everything's gonna be fine.
She's a friend? It's gonna be okay.

838
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,749
She has trouble breathing.
She has asthma.

839
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:27,003
The paramedics
have everything under control.

840
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,631
Hey, Al.

841
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,592
Take a look over here.

842
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:54,613
It's okay, Joe. It's okay.

843
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:05,166
Claire, honey? Can you hear me?

844
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,628
You're safe now. You're in a hospital.

845
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:14,258
Just try and rest, okay?

846
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,438
Michael.

847
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,193
I keep seeing Marlene's face.

848
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:18,197
I can't believe she's gone.

849
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,787
Come inside.

850
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,043
That's better.

851
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:34,713
You're soaked.

852
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,049
Soaked through.

853
01:25:49,728 --> 01:25:50,938
Peyton.

854
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,487
There's only one woman for me.

855
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,870
 That's all you need.

856
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:23,345
Thanks.

857
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:27,641
Thank you very much.

858
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,775
- You okay?
- Fine.

859
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:38,569
Emma?

860
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,615
Fasten your seat belt, sweetheart.

861
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,387
I got it.

862
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:14,521
- Hi, Peyton.
- Hi, Emma.

863
01:27:17,358 --> 01:27:20,569
Hello, Claire,
it's good to have you home.

864
01:27:20,653 --> 01:27:22,363
It's good to be home.

865
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,115
Michael, the school secretary called.

866
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:28,118
The meeting is Thursday.
I wrote it in your book.

867
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:32,206
Okay, great, thanks. It's a fund-raiser.

868
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,458
Peyton heard about it
when she picked up Emma.

869
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,589
You said I could borrow it. Is it all right?

870
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,510
Yeah.

871
01:27:45,803 --> 01:27:48,681
I'll be right back.
I don't want to burn dinner.

872
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:51,850
It's great to have you back.

873
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:05,030
You like it? Peyton did it.

874
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:09,159
Someone could have asked me first.

875
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,203
We thought it would be a surprise.

876
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:12,871
We thought you might like it.

877
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:15,916
If you don't, I'll have her take it down.

878
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:18,460
It's okay.

879
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,006
All right, well, I'll put your things away.

880
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,773
All right, do you have any sevens?

881
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:40,858
Go fish.

882
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,987
Look what I took, huh?

883
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,157
Do you have a ten?

884
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,992
Go fish!

885
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:57,249
Keep your cards up here
so Peyton can't see them.

886
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,209
So you can't see them.

887
01:29:21,482 --> 01:29:24,276
Yeah, that's it.

888
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,653
There we go.

889
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:34,244
Did she tell you
where she was going in such a hurry?

890
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:37,790
No, she just took off.
Told me to cancel her morning.

891
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:51,095
What was she doing before she left?

892
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:54,598
I had just given her these listings
she had asked for.

893
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,519
She looked at them.
A minute later, she hurried out of here.

894
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:01,939
- Listings? These?
- Those are the ones.

895
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:52,865
Mrs. Harris?

896
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:56,285
I'm glad you made it.

897
01:30:57,119 --> 01:30:59,746
Bruce Silverman, Windemere Realty.

898
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:04,251
- Would you care to take a look inside?
- Yeah.

899
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:12,885
I'm glad you made it.
I was just on my way out.

900
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:26,231
The house was custom-built
three years ago.

901
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:29,902
It's listed well below market value.

902
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:33,614
They're very motivated.

903
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,578
- May I?
- Of course.

904
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:45,834
The original owners
lived here a very short time.

905
01:31:45,918 --> 01:31:47,794
New carpet throughout.

906
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,089
There is a nursery?

907
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:55,385
Perfect room for kids.

908
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:08,106
That's a strange-looking toy. What is it?

909
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:13,111
It's a breast pump.

910
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,655
Breast pump?

911
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,785
She used it to keep her milk up.

912
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:38,679
I don't understand where she could be.

913
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:39,930
I don't either.

914
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,437
Here she is.

915
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:55,320
- Where have you been?
- Michael, I've got...

916
01:33:01,952 --> 01:33:03,662
Claire, we were worried about you.

917
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:16,758
- Claire, my God!
- She's Dr. Mott's widow, Michael.

918
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,011
She's what?

919
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,139
Get out of our house.

920
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,892
She's turning on me,
just like you said she would.

921
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:29,605
She doesn't realize
how I've come through for this family.

922
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:33,859
You have to tell her, tell her about us.

923
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,570
There's nothing to tell.

924
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:38,405
You should leave.

925
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:41,700
Michael, what are you saying?

926
01:33:42,326 --> 01:33:44,953
You told me
there was only one woman for you.

927
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:48,624
I meant Claire, my wife.

928
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:55,047
Okay, fine.

929
01:33:57,841 --> 01:34:00,093
I'll just get my baby
and we'll be on our way.

930
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:07,726
I meant, I'll just go get my things.

931
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,395
Michael.

932
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:14,232
You don't understand.

933
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:15,442
I mean, leave now.

934
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:18,070
We'll send your things.

935
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,530
You're right, Michael. That's best.

936
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,002
The keys.

937
01:34:36,922 --> 01:34:37,923
Of course.

938
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:43,929
I'm sorry. You've been so kind.

939
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,391
- Mommy, Daddy, what's happening?
- Emma, stay there!

940
01:34:48,433 --> 01:34:49,893
It's okay, Emma.

941
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:52,771
Mommy and Daddy want me to leave.

942
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:54,856
Goodbye, Peyton.

943
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,027
Peyton !

944
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:11,957
- Call the police!
- Claire, calm down.

945
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:14,668
You don't know what she's capable of!

946
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:16,169
We have her keys!

947
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,256
I think she rigged the greenhouse
for me!

948
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:22,968
Get the kids' things.

949
01:35:23,135 --> 01:35:24,302
We'll go to a hotel.

950
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,304
Go upstairs, sweetheart.

951
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:30,892
Can you get someone
over here right away?

952
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:33,812
<i>It's not an emergency situation.</i>

953
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:35,355
Well, no.

954
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,692
<i>I'll have a car there as soon as I can.</i>

955
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:40,777
All right, we live at 808 Yakima.

956
01:35:41,695 --> 01:35:45,407
Emma, sweetheart, we're gonna go
away for a few days, okay?

957
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:47,826
Bring dolly with you.

958
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:27,365
Peyton?

959
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:37,292
Peyton?

960
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:27,926
Michael?

961
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,095
Daddy?

962
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:46,194
Emma, I want you to lock
this door behind me.

963
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:49,114
- Don't open it until I come back.
- Yeah.

964
01:37:50,574 --> 01:37:51,992
Stay here.

965
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:08,675
Michael?

966
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,801
Claire.

967
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,558
- Michael.
- I'm okay.

968
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,352
She's in the house.

969
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:09,527
I can't move. My legs are broken.

970
01:39:10,195 --> 01:39:12,906
- I'll get the kids.
- Call the police.

971
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:33,510
Mommy?

972
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,903
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

973
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:53,905
Hello, yeah.

974
01:39:54,364 --> 01:39:56,992
We need help at 808 North Yakima.

975
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:58,910
Mommy!

976
01:40:08,128 --> 01:40:09,337
 My family!

977
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:18,179
It's my family.

978
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,445
It's okay, Emma.

979
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:35,655
Mommy's here.

980
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:42,287
I'm gonna take you and Joe.
We're gonna have a real family.

981
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,205
You never have to see
those people again.

982
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:49,169
So tell your mommy, where's Joe?

983
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:52,964
Where is he?

984
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:56,342
He's in there.

985
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:07,979
You're not my mommy!

986
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:15,153
Emma!

987
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:46,851
Quiet.

988
01:41:57,529 --> 01:41:58,696
<i> Emma!</i>

989
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:01,157
Emma!

990
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,375
Emma.

991
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,419
You're being very bad, Emma.

992
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:05,388
You.

993
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,520
- You give him over.
- No!

994
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,397
- No?
- No!

995
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:17,317
You give me my baby
or I'll bash your skull in!

996
01:43:17,442 --> 01:43:18,526
Peyton !

997
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:25,617
It's my family, Peyton.

998
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:40,298
Don't hurt my mommy!

999
01:43:56,314 --> 01:43:57,649
Something the matter, Claire?

1000
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,743
When your husband makes love to you,
it's my face he sees.

1001
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:15,291
When your baby's hungry,
it's my breast that feeds him.

1002
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,211
Look at you.

1003
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:20,838
When push comes to shove,

1004
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:25,218
you can't even breathe.

1005
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,398
- Now, give him to me.
- No!

1006
01:44:58,876 --> 01:44:59,877
No!

1007
01:45:04,424 --> 01:45:05,466
No!

1008
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:37,248
Solomon.

1009
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:41,836
He's okay. I didn't hurt him.

1010
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:43,963
- I know, I know.
- Okay?

1011
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:50,136
Emma! Emma, it's okay.

1012
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:53,431
Come on, come on, up we go.

1013
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:56,601
Mommy!

1014
01:46:04,317 --> 01:46:06,569
Let's go down to Daddy, okay?

1015
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,784
Solomon, I need you
to do something for me.

1016
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:14,786
I need you to take Joey downstairs.

1017
01:46:16,454 --> 01:46:20,249
No, I'm not supposed
to handle the baby.

1018
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:23,544
That's okay.

1019
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:26,130
I trust you, Solomon.

1020
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:33,805
It's okay?

1021
01:46:35,348 --> 01:46:37,892
Okay? Yeah.

1022
01:46:39,644 --> 01:46:42,647
Boy. There you are.

1023
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:45,274
Come on, sweetheart.

1024
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:49,695
- Let's go and get Daddy.
- Oh, my, little baby.

1025
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:52,698
Solomon?

1026
01:46:54,367 --> 01:46:55,743
Come on.
