1
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,039
No.

2
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,321
No means no.

3
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,632
Bonjour.

4
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:55,235
Carl, I know it's you.

5
00:00:55,404 --> 00:00:57,099
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,774
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:02,240
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

8
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:03,605
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:07,112
Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don 't.

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,840
So, what are you doing?

11
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,283
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:12,454 --> 00:01:14,922
- You did get my text, right?
- What? T ext? What?

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,523
We're all going out tonight.

14
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:19,286
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,485
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,528
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:23,960
No, I don 't at all.

18
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:27,296
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,199
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:31,600
Thing? What thing?

21
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:33,264
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:36,377
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,775
- ...but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.

24
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:42,041
I don 't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.

25
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:43,809
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:47,080
Specific things.
Like "get in line at the video store "?

27
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:49,383
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,049
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:55,663
I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.

30
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,630
- That's not me.
- It's not?

31
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:03,499
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,731
who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,500
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:08,700
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:11,812
because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,506
Carl, I know you're not saying anything.

37
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:18,950
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,783
- What? AII right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,686
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,321
Hi.

41
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,694
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:36,304
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,270
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:41,375
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:45,138
some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,872
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,517
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,119
because we have an announcement
to make.

49
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:54,187
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,919
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,389
We're engaged.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,960
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,691
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,732
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:08,267
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:10,268
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,907
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

58
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:17,678
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

59
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,905
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,107
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:25,520
- Yeah, we'II figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:27,281
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:30,050
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:33,285
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:36,522
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,627
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,603
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,471
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,739
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,213
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:55,384 --> 00:03:57,579
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:00,381
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,581
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,123
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:05,555
Hey.

76
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,820
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:07,996 --> 00:04:10,988
- I don't believe we....
- No, I don't believe we have.

78
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,763
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:16,461
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:18,230
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:21,968
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,170
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

83
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:28,248
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:32,080
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,023
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

86
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,750
Whoa!

87
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,432
See you, guys.

88
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:12,154
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,659
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,957
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

91
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:20,033
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,794
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,235
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:27,671
Good show tonight. Come check us out.

95
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,268
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,005
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:36,514
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,649
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:43,784
Persianwifefinder.com. No, thank you.

100
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:48,023
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:50,989
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,063
Here we go.

103
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:59,173
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:02,442
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:05,336
Norman. Line one.

106
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:08,883
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,111
- I'II just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,244
You're with Norman.

109
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:20,084
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:20,262 --> 00:06:21,593
Okay.

111
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:25,958
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,533
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,796
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

114
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,497
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:35,575
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:39,145
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:42,408
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,382
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:49,152
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:51,224
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:56,126
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:59,358
This'II cheer you up. I'm having a
little get-together at my place.

123
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:03,470
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,063
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,632
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,970
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,513
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,309
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

129
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:18,544
- ...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

130
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,755
I admit, business has been slow.

131
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:24,858
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

132
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,086
what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

133
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:30,696
but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

134
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,768
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

135
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:36,096
- None.
- And your credit...

136
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,796
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

137
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:42,000
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

138
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:55,684
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

139
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:58,690
Nick Lane? Hey.

140
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,829
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:06,127
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

142
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,326
You must be running this place by now.

143
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:11,995
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

144
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:13,573
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

145
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,403
God.

146
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:18,536
She's good. What have you been doing?

147
00:08:18,713 --> 00:08:21,876
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

148
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,577
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

149
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:27,312
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

150
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,481
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

151
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:33,890
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

152
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,022
I'm a yes man.

153
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:39,164
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

154
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,063
No, thanks. I'm fine.

155
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,999
"Fine? " I wipe my ass with "fine."

156
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:44,832
Wow. Okay.

157
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:49,500
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,506
No, you don't.

159
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,371
Why don't you take this rock...

160
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,677
throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

161
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,845
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

162
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:03,616
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,757
Oh, my God.

164
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,123
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

165
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,622
Stay right there.

166
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,630
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

167
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:21,135
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

168
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,176
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

169
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,487
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

170
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:38,116
Sorry.

171
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:41,790
- Hello?
- Stephanie?

172
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,295
- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.

173
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:48,596
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

174
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,527
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

175
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:53,902
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

176
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,100
Good for you. Good for you.

177
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:11,014
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

178
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:21,128
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

179
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:32,813
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

180
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:37,350
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

181
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,884
You're so full of shit.

182
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:43,689
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

183
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,656
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

184
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:50,395
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

185
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:53,796
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

186
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,529
Listen, I'II make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

187
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:59,572
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'II go out, swashbuckle.

188
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,107
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:06,304
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

190
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,473
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

191
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,051
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

192
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,384
And I know that you have issues because of
it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

193
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:20,085
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

194
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,696
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

195
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:25,059
I mean, do you even know
my fiancee's last name?

196
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,202
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

197
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,602
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

198
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:36,005
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

199
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:37,667
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

200
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:40,208
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

201
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:43,078
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

202
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:46,746
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

203
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:48,786
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, I...

204
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:52,051
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

205
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,560
I'm telling you, you don't change your
life, you're gonna end up lonely.

206
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,100
A lonely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

207
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,635
Hey, Carl.

208
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:13,414
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

209
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:20,754
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

210
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,485
Nope. No more than usual.

211
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,459
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

212
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:34,168
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

213
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,098
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,432
He never did much.

215
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:39,937
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

216
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,575
Wasn't a good anything.

217
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:46,737
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

218
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:48,746
Now, that's upsetting.

219
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,556
What was that?

220
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,535
Welcome to yes. We are about to begin.

221
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,399
Please, find a seat.

222
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,901
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

223
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:51,602
Carl, man, hey.

224
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,873
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

225
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,247
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

226
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,579
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

227
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:02,587
I saw it in your eyes, man. You're gonna love this.
Terrence is a genius.

228
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:06,784
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

229
00:14:06,961 --> 00:14:09,429
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

230
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:10,791
That's why you're here.

231
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:14,833
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

232
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:16,831
It's starting.

233
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,363
Life.

234
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:23,268
We are all living it. Or are we?

235
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,810
Ooh, heavy.

236
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:31,384
Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?

237
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:33,680
From the external.

238
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:37,916
And how do we control the external?
With one word.

239
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,024
And what is that word?

240
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,588
- Yes!
- Jeez.

241
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,759
Yes.

242
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,426
Yes.

243
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:53,138
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

244
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,741
- Yes!
- Whoo!

245
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,247
The word is "yes."

246
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:07,285
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:09,717
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

248
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,585
Say it a million more times.

249
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,058
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

250
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,357
Yes!

251
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,397
Yes.

252
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:30,576
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

253
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:35,580
because it will RSVP "yes."

254
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:41,646
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

255
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:48,251
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

256
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:55,202
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

257
00:15:57,605 --> 00:16:02,542
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

258
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,837
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

259
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:11,282
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

260
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:18,851
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

261
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,659
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

262
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,500
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

263
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,067
Thank you.

264
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:36,301
Back up just a little bit more.

265
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:39,241
- No.
- No man. No man.

266
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,473
No man. No man. No man.

267
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,843
No man. No man.

268
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,416
Okay.

269
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,089
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

270
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:53,482
Terrence will come to the molehill.

271
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:02,694
What's your name?

272
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:05,938
Carl.

273
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:07,739
Let me guess, Carl.

274
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,571
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

275
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,170
- Yes.
- Yes!

276
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:18,080
And you're not sure about this, are you?

277
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:19,710
No.

278
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:23,948
No man. No man. No man. No man.

279
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,752
You're dead, Carl.

280
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,860
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

281
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:33,028
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

282
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,566
and to yourself.

283
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:38,630
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

284
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:43,038
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

285
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:45,076
And you lost the love of your life...

286
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:48,238
because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

287
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:56,052
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

288
00:17:56,224 --> 00:18:00,388
you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

289
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,522
Am I right, Carl?

290
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:11,396
I have had some trouble.

291
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:21,437
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

292
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:25,074
- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh....

293
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,045
The word is "yes," Carl.

294
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:29,450
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:30,648
- Yes!
- Yes.

296
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,315
Yes!

297
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,354
Once you leave this building...

298
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,522
every time an opportunity
presents itself...

299
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,498
no matter what it is...

300
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,729
you will say yes.

301
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:45,998
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:47,471
- Yes.
- Yes!

303
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,735
- Yes.
- Yes.

304
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,942
What if I...

305
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,843
say...

306
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,808
the other word?

307
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:01,554
You'II be making a promise to yourself.

308
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,750
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

309
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:09,226
things can get a little dicey.

310
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:11,957
What do you say, Carl?

311
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:15,597
Are you ready to make a covenant?

312
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,531
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

313
00:19:17,705 --> 00:19:19,002
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:21,300
- Yes.
- Again.

315
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:22,909
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,908
- Say it again.
- Yes!

317
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:30,682
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:35,547
Yes!

319
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:05,276
Hey, there he is.

320
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,216
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

321
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:08,753
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

322
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:11,221
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

323
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:14,850
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:19,227
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

325
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:24,599
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

326
00:20:25,406 --> 00:20:28,136
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

327
00:20:29,076 --> 00:20:30,873
Oh. Ugh....

328
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:32,410
Yes!

329
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:36,842
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

330
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:41,420
Yeah, why not?

331
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:45,952
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

332
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:55,995
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

333
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,495
Keep going or this'II do,
because it doesn't really matter?

334
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,864
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

335
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,633
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

336
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:36,538
Go ahead.

337
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,369
And what did you say?

338
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:45,946
Oh, I'm just right over here. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:47,782
What? Hello? Hello?

340
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,658
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

341
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:53,487
Oh, great.

342
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:58,688
- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.

343
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:02,324
I mean, it's real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

344
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,169
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

345
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,007
No problem. Have a good night.

346
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:11,811
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

347
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,205
Okay.

348
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:18,409
I've come this far.

349
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,015
Yes, you can.

350
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:24,919
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

351
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:34,066
Sure. It's all yours.

352
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,438
God bless you, man.

353
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:02,295
Oh, come on.

354
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:05,262
Come on, come on.

355
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:10,932
Perfect.

356
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:15,473
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give
all your money away to a homeless guy?

357
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,133
Yes, yes, I do.

358
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:18,835
Letting him
burn out your phone...

359
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:21,277
so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

360
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,940
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

361
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,949
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

362
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,488
and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

363
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,639
Come on, man.

364
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:55,604
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

365
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,592
Would you like to carry a 20-pound container
of gas up a giant hill to your car?

366
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,864
Oh, could I? Could I really?

367
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:21,764
That's a good look.

368
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:27,204
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

369
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,510
Did you just run out of gas?

370
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:32,282
Maybe.

371
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:37,947
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

372
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,956
When you were driving
out of your way...

373
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:43,893
to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

374
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,863
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

375
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:49,434
No. Why would you assume that?

376
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:52,635
He used up your phone?

377
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:56,743
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

378
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:59,505
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

379
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,672
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

380
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,478
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

381
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:08,144
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

382
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:10,518
Well, do you need a ride?

383
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,150
On that thing?

384
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,032
Am I going too fast for you?

385
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:29,074
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

386
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:32,007
That way if we crash, at least I'II die.

387
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:34,909
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

388
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:49,092
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

389
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:55,027
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

390
00:26:07,448 --> 00:26:11,509
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

391
00:26:13,654 --> 00:26:15,986
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

392
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,388
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

393
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,552
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

394
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,222
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

395
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,969
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

396
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:33,299
Yeah.

397
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:36,639
Thanks.

398
00:26:37,778 --> 00:26:38,938
So you okay?

399
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:42,310
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

400
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:45,008
- What?
- What did you say?

401
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:50,247
Hey, I...

402
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,588
Have a good night.

403
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,790
Yes.

404
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,668
"Yes always leads to something good.

405
00:27:39,707 --> 00:27:41,902
Never avoid opportunities.

406
00:27:42,076 --> 00:27:44,169
They may come in any form."

407
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:51,913
- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.

408
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:55,021
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

409
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:56,918
I guess.

410
00:27:58,192 --> 00:28:01,059
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

411
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:02,889
Is there any way you could come in?

412
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,125
Sure.

413
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:08,757
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

414
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:13,168
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

415
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:21,270
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

416
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,508
Right.

417
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:25,745
Like I need that.

418
00:28:30,124 --> 00:28:34,993
- Persian wifefinder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.

419
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,653
Would you be the man for me?

420
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,861
I guess so.

421
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:44,233
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

422
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:45,702
And what's your business?

423
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:49,104
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

424
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,469
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

425
00:28:54,014 --> 00:28:56,539
Oh. Yeah, right.

426
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:59,083
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

427
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:01,785
So, what do you think?

428
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,683
I think yes.

429
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,490
Inta-maresting.

430
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,434
Cakes, huh?

431
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:19,698
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

432
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,538
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,237
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

434
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:31,248
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

435
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:33,317
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

436
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:35,682
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

437
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:37,721
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

438
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:38,915
What?

439
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:43,655
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

440
00:29:43,831 --> 00:29:47,426
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

441
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:50,035
whichever, or I walk."

442
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:52,468
Really? What did they say?

443
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:56,370
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

444
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:58,875
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

445
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:02,504
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

446
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,307
And?

447
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:05,849
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

448
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:07,782
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

449
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,684
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

450
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:11,722
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

451
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:14,190
to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

452
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:16,556
- No.
- How did you know that?

453
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,754
He's not here.

454
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:20,297
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

455
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:23,459
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

456
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,136
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:31,334
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

458
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:34,345
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

459
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:37,382
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

460
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:40,310
See what I did there?

461
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:45,789
I joined "bro" with "Joseph." Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

462
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:47,783
Very cool, Norm.

463
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:54,857
I have been such a dick and a douche.

464
00:30:55,302 --> 00:30:57,668
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

465
00:30:57,838 --> 00:31:00,636
but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

466
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:05,470
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

467
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,171
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

468
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:12,114
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

469
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:16,313
and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

470
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,459
AII right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

471
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:21,890
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

472
00:31:22,062 --> 00:31:23,927
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

473
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:27,066
and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

474
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:33,365
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

475
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,905
Okay.

476
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:43,246
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

477
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:46,614
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

478
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:52,115
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

479
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:58,062
Argh!

480
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,234
Okay, okay.

481
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:23,649
He did it.

482
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,965
Drinks on me.

483
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:37,030
Crazy, man.

484
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,803
Carl, that was so awesome.

485
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,441
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could I...

486
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,440
Absolutely.

487
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:48,809
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

488
00:32:51,785 --> 00:32:53,753
Was I chewing gum before?

489
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:56,446
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

490
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:59,285
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

491
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:04,658
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

492
00:33:04,831 --> 00:33:07,994
I made a sacred "conevant."

493
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:10,129
That sounded naughty.

494
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:13,569
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

495
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,073
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

496
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,071
Okay. But if I win...

497
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:24,115
I get to take that pretty girl of yours
to a ball...

498
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:26,616
because she deserves that.

499
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,245
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

500
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:32,982
That is so nice.

501
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,888
Oh, shit.

502
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:44,631
AII right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

503
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:47,433
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

504
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,303
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

505
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:52,206
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

506
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:54,313
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

507
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:58,042
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

508
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:00,482
You want some, huh, more?

509
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:04,021
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

510
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:06,250
Oh, where'd I go?

511
00:34:06,426 --> 00:34:08,519
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

512
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:13,129
Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?

513
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,933
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

514
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:19,869
and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

515
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,634
and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

516
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:26,944
Just don't
break my teeth off on the curb, okay?

517
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:30,982
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

518
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:32,175
What?

519
00:34:32,352 --> 00:34:37,153
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

520
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:40,691
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

521
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:47,965
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

522
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:50,896
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

523
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:52,595
That's why you got punched out...

524
00:34:52,773 --> 00:34:56,334
because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

525
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,909
I'm over here, dickhole.

526
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

527
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:04,340
You're a complete...

528
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:06,643
You all right?

529
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,913
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

530
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:10,818
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

531
00:35:10,991 --> 00:35:12,982
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

532
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,025
I'm glad we had this experience.

533
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:20,595
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

534
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:27,437
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

535
00:35:30,644 --> 00:35:33,078
She's never gonna go to a ball.

536
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:36,044
No. No, she's not.

537
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:11,775
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

538
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,351
What can I do for you?

539
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,853
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

540
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:19,450
Oh, really?

541
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:31,797
Okay. That should just about do it.

542
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:35,373
- I'II see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

543
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:39,107
Oh, not so fast.

544
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:41,112
What are you doing?

545
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:45,918
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

546
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:48,646
I'm getting so forgetful.

547
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:51,882
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:54,856
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

549
00:36:55,028 --> 00:36:59,124
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

550
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,858
You are so handsome.

551
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,567
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

552
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:13,407
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a
serious thing, but I am dating.

553
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,242
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

554
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,249
You know, a sexual release?

555
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:20,783
Uh....

556
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:26,021
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

557
00:37:26,193 --> 00:37:29,856
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

558
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,397
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

559
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:36,627
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

560
00:37:36,803 --> 00:37:40,068
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

561
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,200
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'II be seeing you.

562
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:49,506
In my nightmares.

563
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:53,148
Oh, come on, give me a break.

564
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:57,351
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

565
00:37:57,524 --> 00:38:02,257
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'II say no!

566
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:17,367
Nice dog.

567
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:33,424
Just relax. I'II handle this.

568
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:40,690
Oh, God!

569
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,464
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my....

570
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:47,365
Wow.

571
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:49,904
That... Oh....

572
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:52,911
That is a....

573
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,876
How are you doing that? Ay!

574
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:05,115
"Costume party. Come as your favorite
Harry Potter character."

575
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,316
You got it, Norm.

576
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:55,365
Hi.

577
00:39:57,544 --> 00:40:01,036
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

578
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:04,081
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

579
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,386
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

580
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:10,421
- ...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

581
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,788
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

582
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:18,294
Yeah. AII right.

583
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:24,931
Hey. It's really working. Ah!

584
00:40:29,476 --> 00:40:32,912
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

585
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,640
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

586
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:38,477
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

587
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:45,648
I would understand

588
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,317
AII right, now I got it.

589
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:54,561
Whoa.

590
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:10,309
What did he call me?

591
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:16,946
Homeless.

592
00:41:18,158 --> 00:41:19,955
Come and get it.

593
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,128
There you are. You want some?

594
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:23,659
He never listens.

595
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:26,022
Yeah.

596
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,133
I wanna start an
organic-fertilizer distribution business.

597
00:41:34,274 --> 00:41:35,332
Next.

598
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,977
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

599
00:41:40,146 --> 00:41:41,841
Way to stick in there.

600
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,498
There you go.

601
00:42:02,735 --> 00:42:05,101
Hey. I came.

602
00:42:05,672 --> 00:42:07,367
Great.

603
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:10,003
Yeah.

604
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:13,506
Rolling Rock, please.

605
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:19,249
From the dawn of time...
In the netherworld.

606
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:22,715
There was a band.

607
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,914
Oh, yes, there was.

608
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:26,957
And we were that band.

609
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,924
Yes, we were.

610
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,858
And that band made rock 'n' roll.

611
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,588
Oh, yes, they did.

612
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:37,859
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

613
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:39,470
Yeah.

614
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,699
And that band was rad.

615
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:50,739
Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

616
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,817
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.
- You're kidding me.

617
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:56,114
I should have been the one
To break up with you

618
00:42:56,289 --> 00:42:58,223
You said, "Who are you?"

619
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:00,222
Who are you?

620
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:05,797
I wanna snap your neck and spit on you
You said, "Who are you?"

621
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:07,830
Who are you?

622
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:13,264
If I got a call that said you were dead
You said, "Who are you?"

623
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:15,464
Who are you?

624
00:43:15,642 --> 00:43:20,409
I'd shrug my shoulders, and I'd say whatevs
You said, "Who are you?"

625
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,071
Who are you?

626
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:27,686
Hey, did you ever meet my friend Ian?
He' s a computer hacker.

627
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:31,312
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

628
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:35,860
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

629
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:37,929
Happy networking, asshole.

630
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:58,776
Don't call me past 1 1 p.m.
It won't happen again

631
00:43:58,952 --> 00:44:00,817
Happened once, it happened twice

632
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:04,650
It happened three times,
Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe

633
00:44:04,824 --> 00:44:07,759
Maybe it happened six times
But it won 't happen a seventh time

634
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:09,827
No, no, no, no

635
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:17,460
I'm not your late night booty call

636
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:21,830
Whore no more

637
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:26,911
Don 't call me past 1 1 p.m.
It won 't happen again

638
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:29,242
You can call me at 1 0:59

639
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:33,943
But don 't call me at 1 1
'Cause that's my rule now

640
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,821
Can I get a water?

641
00:44:51,504 --> 00:44:54,667
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

642
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:58,242
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

643
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:01,175
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

644
00:45:01,347 --> 00:45:03,315
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

645
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:06,043
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

646
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:09,188
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

647
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:15,220
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

648
00:45:15,395 --> 00:45:18,762
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

649
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:21,764
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

650
00:45:21,934 --> 00:45:23,231
You want a drink?

651
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:26,599
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

652
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:29,936
- So I have to go, but....
- Oh, really?

653
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:34,771
But you can walk me to my scooter.

654
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:38,582
I teach a jogging photo group...

655
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:43,154
for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

656
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,723
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

657
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:49,885
It's in Griffith Park
and we do a loop. It's about five miles.

658
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:52,361
It's at 6 a.m.

659
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:56,798
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a.m.
in, like, never.

660
00:45:56,969 --> 00:46:01,099
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

661
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:03,908
Okay, so you're in a band...

662
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:07,171
you do the jogging photography,
what else?

663
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,473
Whatever I want.

664
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:13,016
I volunteer at a shelter.
I paint a little bit.

665
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:15,620
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

666
00:46:15,788 --> 00:46:18,052
And some nude modeling, FYI.

667
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,419
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to....

668
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:28,198
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

669
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,461
I didn't ask you out.

670
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:32,831
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

671
00:46:33,005 --> 00:46:34,404
You said that.

672
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,202
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

673
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:42,104
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

674
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:46,342
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

675
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:47,713
Yeah, I'd love to.

676
00:46:49,288 --> 00:46:53,190
Okay. I'II see you tomorrow....

677
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,624
- Carl.
- Allison.

678
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:14,470
Yeah, Rooney?

679
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:16,376
Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.

680
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:20,110
Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?

681
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:21,844
Yeah.

682
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,863
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

683
00:47:32,031 --> 00:47:33,293
- Allison?
- Yeah?

684
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:35,331
Do we need to use a flash?

685
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,332
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

686
00:47:45,778 --> 00:47:49,009
Beautiful night, guys. You take it
to the limit, and I respect that.

687
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:51,980
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

688
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:56,212
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

689
00:47:56,389 --> 00:47:59,449
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

690
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:03,561
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

691
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:06,355
Allison, I'm here.

692
00:48:08,034 --> 00:48:09,194
Allison.

693
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,562
Hey. Who were those guys?

694
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:17,038
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

695
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,111
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

696
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:22,577
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

697
00:48:22,748 --> 00:48:26,479
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

698
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:28,517
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

699
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:31,054
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

700
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:34,660
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

701
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:37,557
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

702
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,722
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

703
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,300
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

704
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:45,061
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

705
00:48:45,238 --> 00:48:46,364
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

706
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:47,766
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

707
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,238
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

708
00:48:50,409 --> 00:48:52,502
Red Bull.

709
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:57,743
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

710
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,317
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

711
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,681
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

712
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,256
Oh, it's a good one.

713
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:16,357
Hold that.

714
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:18,829
Got it.

715
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:31,007
Hey, Carl, you okay?

716
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:35,744
Hold it right there.

717
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,560
That's good.

718
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:58,800
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

719
00:49:59,178 --> 00:50:01,112
Kind of mysterious.

720
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,406
You know, listen.

721
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:06,018
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

722
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:08,517
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

723
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:10,553
I love that.

724
00:50:10,723 --> 00:50:13,920
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

725
00:50:14,093 --> 00:50:16,152
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

726
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:19,765
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

727
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:22,594
just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

728
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:26,431
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

729
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:30,337
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life."

730
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:32,238
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

731
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:36,172
So, what happened
to closed-off-Iittle-box boy?

732
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:39,614
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

733
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:43,186
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

734
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:45,615
Might be.

735
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:49,494
Closed-off-Iittle-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

736
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:52,927
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

737
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:56,091
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

738
00:50:56,268 --> 00:50:59,897
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

739
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,437
Gone, never saw him again.

740
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:06,005
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

741
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,539
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

742
00:51:09,715 --> 00:51:10,807
Kind of dragged on.

743
00:51:10,983 --> 00:51:13,315
- I'II work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

744
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:18,019
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

745
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:31,736
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

746
00:51:31,904 --> 00:51:34,372
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

747
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,030
She's the complete opposite of me.

748
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,506
Carl, could you please pass the Cholula?

749
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,646
Sure, Faranoush.

750
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,013
How did you two meet again?

751
00:51:43,182 --> 00:51:46,845
Persianwifefinder.com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

752
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:49,419
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

753
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:51,988
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

754
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:55,025
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

755
00:51:55,194 --> 00:51:59,028
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

756
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:00,597
Sorry, Faranoush.

757
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,000
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

758
00:52:05,171 --> 00:52:07,332
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

759
00:52:07,506 --> 00:52:09,906
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

760
00:52:10,076 --> 00:52:13,170
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

761
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:16,872
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

762
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:22,250
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

763
00:52:24,123 --> 00:52:28,355
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

764
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,260
So my friends are being really lame...

765
00:52:32,431 --> 00:52:35,594
and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

766
00:52:35,768 --> 00:52:38,134
Hey, I have an idea.

767
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:41,372
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

768
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,642
Yeah. Sure.

769
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,040
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

770
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,771
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

771
00:52:54,587 --> 00:52:56,680
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:56,856 --> 00:52:59,882
Well, thanks, Carl.

773
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:04,320
Thanks, that's really sweet.

774
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,629
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

775
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:08,790
Thanks, Faranoush.

776
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:11,832
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

777
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:13,266
Costumes for what?

778
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,368
Expelliarmus! Just kidding.

779
00:53:17,543 --> 00:53:19,636
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

780
00:53:19,812 --> 00:53:23,612
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

781
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,343
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

782
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:29,784
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

783
00:53:30,823 --> 00:53:32,051
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

784
00:53:32,224 --> 00:53:36,388
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

785
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,391
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

786
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:42,193
chips, dips...

787
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:45,701
and good people, just like you two.

788
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:47,836
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

789
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:49,736
It's gonna be a crazy night.

790
00:53:55,447 --> 00:53:58,143
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

791
00:53:58,317 --> 00:54:00,842
- Good dip, huh, H.P.?
- Mm.

792
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,184
Got tons of it at Costco. You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

793
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:08,326
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

794
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:12,089
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

795
00:54:12,464 --> 00:54:14,625
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

796
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,763
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

797
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:22,132
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

798
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,778
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn 't it?

799
00:54:27,112 --> 00:54:30,639
" I'm not going home, not really."

800
00:54:33,485 --> 00:54:35,282
Oh, bye.

801
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:43,250
Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets?

802
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,931
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

803
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:57,632
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

804
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,041
That's right. Come in. I'II go in.

805
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:05,013
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

806
00:55:05,184 --> 00:55:08,517
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

807
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:10,484
- That's all right.
- Bye.

808
00:55:10,656 --> 00:55:13,750
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

809
00:55:13,926 --> 00:55:15,985
Next stop, Azkaban.

810
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:25,698
Hey.

811
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:28,266
Do you wanna drive?

812
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:37,947
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

813
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:41,583
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

814
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,657
I got an idea.

815
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:59,634
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

816
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:07,077
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

817
00:56:09,982 --> 00:56:14,885
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

818
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:43,439
This is unreal.

819
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:45,809
I couldn't agree more.

820
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:57,359
Ooh

821
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:01,155
Ooh

822
00:57:06,905 --> 00:57:08,202
Ooh

823
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:27,489
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

824
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:31,824
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

825
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:58,314
Good evening, Los Angeles.

826
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:01,687
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

827
00:58:03,328 --> 00:58:04,989
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

828
00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:06,358
I killed her.

829
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:09,128
I'm a somebody.

830
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:12,530
I don't know about that.

831
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:15,298
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

832
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:18,671
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:58:18,844 --> 00:58:21,574
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

834
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:26,741
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

835
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:31,083
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 1 7,000.

836
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:36,125
So each one of us invites 1 800
of our closest friends.

837
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:39,230
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

838
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:41,229
- What?
- I love doing it.

839
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:43,200
It's like my photography.

840
00:58:43,368 --> 00:58:45,836
I know there isn't that much demand
for photographs...

841
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:47,596
taken while running, but....

842
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:49,900
I wasn't gonna say anything.

843
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,602
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

844
00:58:53,779 --> 00:58:55,371
You know that when you're a kid...

845
00:58:55,547 --> 00:58:58,175
but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

846
00:58:58,984 --> 00:59:00,918
I love your music.

847
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:04,019
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

848
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,585
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

849
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,421
- Stop.
- Stopping.

850
00:59:10,596 --> 00:59:12,894
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

851
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:14,464
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

852
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,396
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

853
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:21,005
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- AII right. I can't please everyone.

854
00:59:24,176 --> 00:59:25,404
Run!

855
00:59:25,677 --> 00:59:27,372
Hello, everybody.

856
00:59:27,546 --> 00:59:32,984
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

857
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,313
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

858
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:42,421
- Lee?
- Hey.

859
00:59:42,594 --> 00:59:45,062
What up, my brizzo?

860
00:59:46,398 --> 00:59:49,492
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

861
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:52,968
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

862
00:59:54,406 --> 00:59:56,465
What's going on, Norm?

863
00:59:56,642 --> 00:59:58,473
Something's going down on a big scale.

864
00:59:58,644 --> 01:00:02,603
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

865
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:05,944
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

866
01:00:06,585 --> 01:00:09,349
Well, we had a nice run.

867
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:11,785
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

868
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:15,116
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'II lead to something good.

869
01:00:15,294 --> 01:00:17,421
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

870
01:00:17,596 --> 01:00:20,030
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

871
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,827
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

872
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:24,263
- I was.
- I was watching you.

873
01:00:24,436 --> 01:00:25,664
Yeah, you were.

874
01:00:25,837 --> 01:00:29,364
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

875
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:32,704
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

876
01:00:32,878 --> 01:00:35,847
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

877
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:37,845
You may be my last loan.

878
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:41,580
It's a Ducati.

879
01:00:41,753 --> 01:00:45,245
I'm thinking it'II get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

880
01:00:46,592 --> 01:00:50,084
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

881
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,726
See you on the other side, Lee.

882
01:00:57,502 --> 01:00:59,197
Carl.

883
01:01:01,573 --> 01:01:04,770
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

884
01:01:04,943 --> 01:01:06,843
Pleasure to meet you.

885
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:18,683
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 Ioans.

886
01:01:18,857 --> 01:01:20,882
You have given out...

887
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,628
561.

888
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:25,853
A little more than average, then.

889
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:28,397
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

890
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:35,806
A $250 Ioan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

891
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:37,908
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

892
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:41,068
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

893
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:43,373
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

894
01:01:43,548 --> 01:01:46,016
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

895
01:01:46,218 --> 01:01:49,210
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

896
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,018
But...

897
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:00,595
But then I looked closer.

898
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:04,062
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

899
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:07,364
more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

900
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:09,632
And because you've given out
so many of them...

901
01:02:09,808 --> 01:02:14,074
we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-Ioans, not bad.

902
01:02:14,446 --> 01:02:16,505
See, Car, you worrywart.

903
01:02:16,682 --> 01:02:20,243
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

904
01:02:20,452 --> 01:02:22,682
- Corporate?
- Wow.

905
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:25,014
That's great. I would have to say...

906
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:28,023
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

907
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:30,354
Iet's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

908
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:34,431
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

909
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:36,298
Got it. Yep.

910
01:02:36,468 --> 01:02:39,437
We'II have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

911
01:02:39,604 --> 01:02:42,129
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

912
01:02:42,307 --> 01:02:46,801
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

913
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:55,383
This one is nice.

914
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:57,954
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

915
01:02:58,123 --> 01:02:59,147
- I love it.
- Yeah?

916
01:02:59,324 --> 01:03:00,689
Yeah.

917
01:03:00,859 --> 01:03:04,420
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

918
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:06,325
It's the same as regular bingo...

919
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:10,127
but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

920
01:03:11,203 --> 01:03:12,227
Yeah.

921
01:03:12,404 --> 01:03:14,304
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

922
01:03:14,473 --> 01:03:16,065
I don't want anything complicated.

923
01:03:16,241 --> 01:03:19,039
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

924
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:21,645
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

925
01:03:21,813 --> 01:03:25,408
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

926
01:03:28,787 --> 01:03:32,780
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'II talk to her.

927
01:04:21,673 --> 01:04:22,697
Okay.

928
01:04:26,445 --> 01:04:28,913
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

929
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,516
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

930
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:40,386
What's going on?

931
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:44,186
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

932
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,056
Jump.

933
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,157
What the hell are you looking at?

934
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:54,730
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

935
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:56,806
Hey, lady, move that dog.

936
01:04:57,409 --> 01:04:59,969
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

937
01:05:00,145 --> 01:05:01,612
Has somebody called the police?

938
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,238
Yeah. He'II be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

939
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:08,750
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

940
01:05:27,472 --> 01:05:28,996
Don't do it.

941
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:33,009
It can't be that bad.

942
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:36,812
Hey, buddy.

943
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:38,939
Who are you, man?

944
01:05:39,117 --> 01:05:42,814
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

945
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:45,923
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

946
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:49,618
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

947
01:05:50,195 --> 01:05:52,322
I should say something to you here.

948
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:55,557
I don't really know what it is.

949
01:05:55,734 --> 01:05:57,827
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

950
01:05:58,003 --> 01:05:59,971
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

951
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:05,809
Wait. I've got it.

952
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:10,374
Where you going, man?

953
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:13,313
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

954
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:15,043
Oh, man.

955
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:24,292
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

956
01:06:24,462 --> 01:06:27,022
Patience is a virtue.

957
01:06:29,968 --> 01:06:32,903
What the hell you doing in there?

958
01:06:35,607 --> 01:06:39,737
I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend

959
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:46,415
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in

960
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:50,180
And if you never want to see me again

961
01:06:50,355 --> 01:06:55,520
I would understand

962
01:06:55,694 --> 01:07:02,691
I would understand

963
01:07:03,034 --> 01:07:04,865
Um... Oh...

964
01:07:05,303 --> 01:07:06,429
What is it?

965
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:09,933
The angry boy a bit too insane

966
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:12,939
Icing over a secret pain

967
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:18,344
You know you don 't belong

968
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:22,680
Everyone I know has got a reason

969
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:24,611
To say

970
01:07:24,789 --> 01:07:26,279
You can put the past away

971
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:30,485
I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend

972
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:35,395
You could cut ties with all the lies
You've been living in

973
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:39,264
And if you never want to see me again

974
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:44,136
I would understand

975
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:47,142
I would understand

976
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,881
I would understand

977
01:07:54,052 --> 01:07:58,045
I would understand

978
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:01,223
I would understand

979
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:12,494
I got blisters on my fingers.

980
01:08:20,812 --> 01:08:22,404
Carl.

981
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:25,407
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

982
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:27,676
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

983
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:31,618
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

984
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:36,090
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

985
01:08:37,128 --> 01:08:41,087
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

986
01:08:41,266 --> 01:08:44,360
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

987
01:08:44,536 --> 01:08:47,004
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

988
01:08:47,172 --> 01:08:49,106
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

989
01:08:49,274 --> 01:08:52,835
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

990
01:08:53,011 --> 01:08:56,310
Keeps it fresh. I'II see you guys.

991
01:08:57,982 --> 01:09:00,576
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

992
01:09:00,752 --> 01:09:02,447
No.

993
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:15,794
So I have some carry-on here.

994
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:20,370
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

995
01:09:20,538 --> 01:09:22,130
We've never done this before.

996
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:29,336
The next flight available for boarding...

997
01:09:29,914 --> 01:09:31,347
is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

998
01:09:33,318 --> 01:09:34,342
Okay.

999
01:09:34,519 --> 01:09:35,543
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,880
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1001
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:38,215
Here we come.

1002
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,355
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1003
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:47,555
Well, clearly we should go there.

1004
01:09:53,371 --> 01:09:55,566
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1005
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,004
weighed over 1 0 and a half pounds."

1006
01:09:58,176 --> 01:10:00,974
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1007
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,948
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1008
01:10:05,116 --> 01:10:06,811
Check out the phone.

1009
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:10,512
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1010
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:12,588
Hello?

1011
01:10:16,928 --> 01:10:18,395
Nice shot.

1012
01:10:20,498 --> 01:10:24,093
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1013
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:26,903
So, what do I do? I just...

1014
01:10:28,606 --> 01:10:31,006
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1015
01:10:32,844 --> 01:10:34,869
- Okay.
- You got it.

1016
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:36,070
Pull?

1017
01:10:37,949 --> 01:10:40,008
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1018
01:10:40,185 --> 01:10:43,086
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1019
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:51,027
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it...

1020
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:55,462
for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.

1021
01:11:03,508 --> 01:11:05,476
Twenty bucks says Oklahoma kills them.

1022
01:11:05,643 --> 01:11:08,203
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1023
01:11:08,379 --> 01:11:09,971
What, do you live here now?

1024
01:11:10,148 --> 01:11:13,777
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1025
01:11:13,952 --> 01:11:16,614
Hey. Is that Carl?

1026
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:18,915
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1027
01:11:20,291 --> 01:11:25,558
The energy is palpable here,
Chris. I can 't even hear myself think.

1028
01:11:26,531 --> 01:11:29,227
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1029
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:34,430
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1030
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:37,097
then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1031
01:11:37,275 --> 01:11:40,267
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1032
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:43,209
and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1033
01:11:44,515 --> 01:11:46,710
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1034
01:11:51,723 --> 01:11:54,385
I can't believe I tripped like that.

1035
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:59,288
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1036
01:11:59,464 --> 01:12:03,059
Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1037
01:12:03,234 --> 01:12:05,099
Don't, please.

1038
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:09,203
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1039
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:12,907
Here. I have to protect you.

1040
01:12:13,177 --> 01:12:14,667
Come on.

1041
01:12:14,846 --> 01:12:18,714
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1042
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:20,578
Come on.

1043
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,615
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1044
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:28,520
Allison, are you okay?

1045
01:12:29,193 --> 01:12:32,492
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

1046
01:12:39,003 --> 01:12:40,334
What?

1047
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,964
I don't know. I think I love you.

1048
01:12:45,376 --> 01:12:46,843
Really?

1049
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:51,607
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1050
01:12:51,783 --> 01:12:55,082
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1051
01:12:55,253 --> 01:12:56,982
I love you like...

1052
01:12:57,488 --> 01:13:00,787
I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1053
01:13:01,592 --> 01:13:03,059
I've been thinking...

1054
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:05,718
and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1055
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:10,766
but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1056
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:15,436
Wow. Really? You've been thinking that?

1057
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,567
What do you think?

1058
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:22,179
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1059
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:23,814
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1060
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,950
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1061
01:13:26,117 --> 01:13:28,745
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1062
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,822
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1063
01:13:33,691 --> 01:13:35,022
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1064
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:39,687
Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you....

1065
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,108
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1066
01:14:00,952 --> 01:14:03,750
I'II just be one minute.

1067
01:14:03,921 --> 01:14:07,413
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1068
01:14:07,592 --> 01:14:09,423
I'm in.

1069
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,424
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1070
01:14:15,366 --> 01:14:16,765
Sir?

1071
01:14:18,136 --> 01:14:21,105
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1072
01:14:21,272 --> 01:14:24,105
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1073
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:29,474
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1074
01:14:29,647 --> 01:14:32,445
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

1075
01:14:32,617 --> 01:14:34,778
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1076
01:14:34,952 --> 01:14:37,785
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1077
01:14:39,223 --> 01:14:41,555
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1078
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:43,318
Come on, lady.

1079
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:48,328
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1080
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:52,663
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1081
01:14:52,837 --> 01:14:54,805
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1082
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:56,963
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1083
01:14:57,141 --> 01:14:58,972
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1084
01:14:59,143 --> 01:15:01,304
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1085
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:05,040
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1086
01:15:05,216 --> 01:15:08,049
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

1087
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:10,312
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1088
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:12,422
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1089
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,855
how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1090
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:20,157
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder.com?

1091
01:15:20,364 --> 01:15:23,390
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1092
01:15:23,568 --> 01:15:26,696
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1093
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:30,637
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan
Officer at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1094
01:15:30,808 --> 01:15:33,333
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1095
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:35,001
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1096
01:15:35,179 --> 01:15:37,374
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1097
01:15:37,548 --> 01:15:40,073
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1098
01:15:40,251 --> 01:15:42,651
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1099
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,380
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1100
01:15:45,556 --> 01:15:47,683
- You were married?
- Yes.

1101
01:15:48,693 --> 01:15:50,854
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1102
01:15:51,028 --> 01:15:53,656
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1103
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:56,766
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1104
01:15:57,902 --> 01:16:01,929
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1105
01:16:03,241 --> 01:16:05,106
His name was Marx.

1106
01:16:08,813 --> 01:16:11,043
I need to speak to my attorney.

1107
01:16:15,753 --> 01:16:18,881
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1108
01:16:19,056 --> 01:16:23,891
that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1109
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:26,154
AII of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1110
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:29,424
the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1111
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,330
it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1112
01:16:33,571 --> 01:16:35,835
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1113
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:37,907
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1114
01:16:38,075 --> 01:16:39,667
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1115
01:16:39,844 --> 01:16:42,904
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

1116
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,049
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1117
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:52,016
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1118
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,158
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1119
01:16:54,325 --> 01:16:57,192
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1120
01:16:57,728 --> 01:16:59,753
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1121
01:16:59,931 --> 01:17:03,662
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's excellent.

1122
01:17:03,834 --> 01:17:05,563
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1123
01:17:05,736 --> 01:17:09,103
you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1124
01:17:09,273 --> 01:17:11,104
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1125
01:17:11,275 --> 01:17:13,266
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1126
01:17:13,444 --> 01:17:15,878
that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1127
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:18,675
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1128
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:21,181
Iike an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1129
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:22,546
You paused.

1130
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,382
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1131
01:17:25,556 --> 01:17:29,686
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1132
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:34,024
was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1133
01:17:41,672 --> 01:17:42,934
Allison.

1134
01:17:44,642 --> 01:17:46,109
Bye, Carl.

1135
01:18:00,358 --> 01:18:03,919
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1136
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:06,287
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1137
01:18:06,464 --> 01:18:09,661
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1138
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:11,825
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1139
01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:14,972
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1140
01:18:15,139 --> 01:18:16,766
Ever think things got screwed up...

1141
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:20,809
because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1142
01:18:20,978 --> 01:18:22,946
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1143
01:18:23,114 --> 01:18:25,582
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1144
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,311
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1145
01:18:29,487 --> 01:18:30,954
a. k.a. what normal people do.

1146
01:18:31,122 --> 01:18:33,886
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1147
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:35,184
Or not.

1148
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:37,259
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

1149
01:18:37,428 --> 01:18:38,918
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1150
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,061
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1151
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:44,433
Carl.

1152
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:49,773
Bye, Carl.

1153
01:18:50,574 --> 01:18:53,475
- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.

1154
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:55,475
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.

1155
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:57,580
You know you and I are a lot alike?

1156
01:18:58,816 --> 01:19:01,148
My mother likes good food.

1157
01:19:02,019 --> 01:19:04,647
She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...

1158
01:19:04,822 --> 01:19:06,756
than bad food any old day
of the week."

1159
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:08,482
Hey.

1160
01:19:08,793 --> 01:19:10,658
It' s me again.

1161
01:19:10,828 --> 01:19:13,296
Specifically I'm talking about 1 5
to 20 percent.

1162
01:19:13,464 --> 01:19:16,433
The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the....

1163
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:35,148
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1164
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,682
You're officially flying by yourself.

1165
01:19:40,257 --> 01:19:41,747
Cool.

1166
01:19:42,193 --> 01:19:45,219
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

1167
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:53,927
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1168
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:55,936
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1169
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:59,235
for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1170
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:03,073
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

1171
01:20:15,126 --> 01:20:16,821
Ah!

1172
01:20:34,512 --> 01:20:35,672
Allison?

1173
01:20:35,846 --> 01:20:39,976
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1174
01:20:40,151 --> 01:20:45,214
- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.

1175
01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:47,220
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1176
01:20:47,391 --> 01:20:49,791
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1177
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,691
- I never really thought of them as...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.

1178
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,194
Wes? Can you hear me?

1179
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,632
Go get the ball!

1180
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:04,241
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

1181
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:08,310
- ...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1182
01:21:08,746 --> 01:21:10,213
Which ones?

1183
01:21:11,882 --> 01:21:14,510
We are Sparta!

1184
01:21:18,255 --> 01:21:19,688
Hi, Norm.

1185
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:45,211
You have three messages.

1186
01:21:45,382 --> 01:21:48,112
Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.

1187
01:21:48,285 --> 01:21:51,152
No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.

1188
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:54,382
I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.

1189
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:57,590
Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.

1190
01:21:57,761 --> 01:22:00,321
You might notice the front bumper missing.
Not to worry.

1191
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:03,262
I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.

1192
01:22:03,434 --> 01:22:07,803
And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don 't forget, no starch. Love you.

1193
01:22:08,405 --> 01:22:11,431
It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...

1194
01:22:11,609 --> 01:22:15,375
but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.

1195
01:22:15,546 --> 01:22:18,674
Haven 't received confirmation
of any sort from you. A t all.

1196
01:22:18,849 --> 01:22:21,511
- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.

1197
01:22:21,685 --> 01:22:23,653
Right? Call me.

1198
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,190
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1199
01:22:37,368 --> 01:22:39,928
- What' s wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1200
01:22:40,104 --> 01:22:41,366
What?

1201
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:44,201
Come on inside. I'II explain everything.

1202
01:22:49,446 --> 01:22:51,710
Surprise!

1203
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:54,476
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1204
01:22:54,652 --> 01:22:56,119
How did you pull this off?

1205
01:22:56,287 --> 01:22:58,949
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1206
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:01,988
I like it, I like it.

1207
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,592
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1208
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:05,854
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1209
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:08,191
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1210
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:11,499
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1211
01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:14,160
On him, on him.

1212
01:23:17,174 --> 01:23:18,198
Cake?

1213
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,399
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1214
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:23,980
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1215
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:28,541
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1216
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:38,985
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1217
01:23:39,163 --> 01:23:41,996
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1218
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:45,033
You know, taking her day by day.

1219
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:48,035
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1220
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:49,565
Oh.

1221
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:58,415
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1222
01:24:00,284 --> 01:24:04,653
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1223
01:24:04,822 --> 01:24:05,846
Do you dance?

1224
01:24:06,423 --> 01:24:08,914
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1225
01:24:09,093 --> 01:24:12,654
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1226
01:24:38,922 --> 01:24:44,554
- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so....

1227
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:50,731
Oh, jeez.

1228
01:24:51,335 --> 01:24:54,634
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1229
01:24:54,805 --> 01:24:56,773
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,034
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1231
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,735
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1232
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:06,974
I guess I'II just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1233
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:08,743
I know it sounds silly...

1234
01:25:08,919 --> 01:25:11,479
but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1235
01:25:11,655 --> 01:25:15,955
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1236
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,255
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1237
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:21,421
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1238
01:25:21,598 --> 01:25:24,226
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1239
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:27,899
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:25:28,072 --> 01:25:30,540
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1241
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,676
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1242
01:25:38,148 --> 01:25:40,048
Hi there.

1243
01:25:40,984 --> 01:25:42,611
Hello there.

1244
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:46,356
You must be Tillie.

1245
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:52,385
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1246
01:25:55,899 --> 01:26:01,997
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1247
01:26:03,407 --> 01:26:05,136
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:26:14,985 --> 01:26:17,545
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1249
01:26:18,188 --> 01:26:24,058
- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?

1250
01:26:24,228 --> 01:26:27,095
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1251
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:31,132
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1252
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:33,030
I don't know.

1253
01:26:33,937 --> 01:26:37,930
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1254
01:26:39,276 --> 01:26:41,744
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1255
01:26:41,912 --> 01:26:46,178
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1256
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:50,684
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1257
01:26:50,854 --> 01:26:57,123
Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well....

1258
01:26:57,294 --> 01:27:00,263
- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph....

1259
01:27:05,102 --> 01:27:06,831
Steph...

1260
01:27:07,504 --> 01:27:09,335
I can't.

1261
01:27:09,973 --> 01:27:11,668
I'm sorry.

1262
01:27:14,178 --> 01:27:16,112
What are you saying?

1263
01:27:17,748 --> 01:27:19,943
I'm saying no.

1264
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:37,900
Are you serious?

1265
01:27:52,282 --> 01:27:53,442
Oh, Jesus.

1266
01:28:00,924 --> 01:28:03,449
Oh, please.

1267
01:28:03,961 --> 01:28:07,590
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1268
01:28:07,764 --> 01:28:11,825
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1269
01:28:12,002 --> 01:28:15,836
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1270
01:28:16,006 --> 01:28:20,204
- No man, no man, no man....
- Not possible!

1271
01:28:22,446 --> 01:28:24,573
Jackoff.

1272
01:28:25,649 --> 01:28:31,178
Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes."

1273
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:33,983
Guess, mess.

1274
01:28:34,157 --> 01:28:40,187
Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.

1275
01:28:40,364 --> 01:28:42,332
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1276
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:09,754
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1277
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:14,858
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman."

1278
01:29:15,032 --> 01:29:18,593
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

1279
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:20,803
Peter.

1280
01:29:21,538 --> 01:29:23,199
A covenant.

1281
01:29:23,373 --> 01:29:25,671
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1282
01:29:26,276 --> 01:29:29,245
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1283
01:29:30,113 --> 01:29:32,946
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1284
01:29:33,116 --> 01:29:34,583
It is nonsense.

1285
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,912
It's him.

1286
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:43,722
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1287
01:29:43,894 --> 01:29:46,692
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

1288
01:29:46,863 --> 01:29:49,297
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1289
01:29:49,466 --> 01:29:53,300
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1290
01:29:54,338 --> 01:29:56,568
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1291
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:00,403
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1292
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:03,546
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1293
01:30:03,714 --> 01:30:05,807
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

1294
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:08,884
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1295
01:30:09,052 --> 01:30:11,020
No, that's not the point.

1296
01:30:11,188 --> 01:30:14,988
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

1297
01:30:15,158 --> 01:30:16,785
to get you started.

1298
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,588
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1299
01:30:19,763 --> 01:30:22,197
not because a covenant tells you to...

1300
01:30:22,366 --> 01:30:25,301
but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1301
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:28,231
Yeah.

1302
01:30:28,805 --> 01:30:30,534
You're right.

1303
01:30:31,274 --> 01:30:34,175
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1304
01:30:34,344 --> 01:30:35,743
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1305
01:30:35,912 --> 01:30:38,472
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1306
01:30:39,082 --> 01:30:43,143
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1307
01:30:43,954 --> 01:30:47,822
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1308
01:30:47,991 --> 01:30:49,253
Perfect.

1309
01:30:52,062 --> 01:30:53,825
I said that.

1310
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:55,658
Whatever.

1311
01:30:57,501 --> 01:31:01,062
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1312
01:31:05,342 --> 01:31:07,810
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1313
01:31:07,978 --> 01:31:10,310
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1314
01:31:12,883 --> 01:31:16,842
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1315
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:21,389
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1316
01:31:21,558 --> 01:31:25,995
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1317
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:28,757
Ducati.

1318
01:31:33,703 --> 01:31:37,139
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1319
01:31:37,307 --> 01:31:40,504
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1320
01:31:40,677 --> 01:31:43,009
No, Carl, this is not the same.

1321
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:46,172
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1322
01:31:47,184 --> 01:31:49,152
Holy Jesus.

1323
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:50,581
Torque.

1324
01:32:02,999 --> 01:32:05,058
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1325
01:32:06,937 --> 01:32:08,165
Ah!

1326
01:32:08,672 --> 01:32:10,503
You might wanna get out of the way.

1327
01:32:21,785 --> 01:32:24,185
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1328
01:32:27,257 --> 01:32:28,315
Ah!

1329
01:32:32,195 --> 01:32:33,594
Whoa!

1330
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:19,804
What an asshole.

1331
01:33:36,026 --> 01:33:37,584
Carl, what are you doing here?

1332
01:33:37,761 --> 01:33:41,663
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1333
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:44,925
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1334
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:47,592
Okay, people, let's go.

1335
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:52,233
But I wanna be with you.

1336
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:54,604
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1337
01:33:54,778 --> 01:33:57,338
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1338
01:33:57,514 --> 01:33:59,846
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1339
01:34:00,016 --> 01:34:02,610
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking.

1340
01:34:02,786 --> 01:34:06,745
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1341
01:34:06,923 --> 01:34:09,892
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1342
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,585
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1343
01:34:12,762 --> 01:34:14,753
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1344
01:34:14,931 --> 01:34:18,697
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

1345
01:34:18,868 --> 01:34:21,837
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1346
01:34:22,005 --> 01:34:25,099
Because the old Carl
didn't think he was enough for anybody.

1347
01:34:25,275 --> 01:34:28,301
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1348
01:34:28,478 --> 01:34:30,810
sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1349
01:34:31,348 --> 01:34:33,816
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1350
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:37,424
But now I know that what I have to share is
pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1351
01:34:38,588 --> 01:34:40,715
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1352
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:42,915
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1353
01:34:43,526 --> 01:34:45,994
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1354
01:34:46,162 --> 01:34:49,495
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1355
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:52,726
and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1356
01:34:52,902 --> 01:34:54,836
You weren't scared of anything.

1357
01:34:55,005 --> 01:34:57,667
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1358
01:34:57,841 --> 01:35:01,004
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1359
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:03,602
And I'm scared too.

1360
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,839
So let's be scared together.

1361
01:35:07,784 --> 01:35:09,775
I don't know what you want me to say.

1362
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,887
So just say yes...

1363
01:35:12,422 --> 01:35:14,856
but only if you really want to.

1364
01:35:15,091 --> 01:35:18,219
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1365
01:35:19,529 --> 01:35:21,360
Yeah, I noticed that.

1366
01:35:21,898 --> 01:35:23,263
Well?

1367
01:35:30,073 --> 01:35:32,303
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1368
01:35:33,176 --> 01:35:36,771
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1369
01:35:43,753 --> 01:35:45,414
I like maybe.

1370
01:35:45,588 --> 01:35:46,782
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1371
01:36:13,717 --> 01:36:17,175
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1372
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,515
You got anything with a flat front?

1373
01:36:19,689 --> 01:36:21,623
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1374
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:25,693
Thanks, guys.

1375
01:36:25,862 --> 01:36:28,456
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

1376
01:36:28,631 --> 01:36:31,191
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1377
01:36:31,368 --> 01:36:32,733
You're a good man, Carl.

1378
01:36:32,902 --> 01:36:37,430
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1379
01:36:38,908 --> 01:36:44,244
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1380
01:36:44,414 --> 01:36:48,851
And the word
you will have said 2 million times is:

1381
01:36:49,018 --> 01:36:51,350
Yes!

1382
01:36:56,826 --> 01:36:58,987
Good God.

1383
01:38:33,089 --> 01:38:35,216
So anything else we need to know?

1384
01:38:35,391 --> 01:38:39,657
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1385
01:38:39,829 --> 01:38:41,387
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1386
01:38:41,564 --> 01:38:42,929
Right.

1387
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,531
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1388
01:38:45,702 --> 01:38:48,398
I never could have finished the suits
without it.

1389
01:38:50,106 --> 01:38:53,633
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1390
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:54,834
What?

1391
01:38:55,011 --> 01:38:57,946
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1392
01:38:58,114 --> 01:38:59,775
What if I'm one of those chickens...

1393
01:38:59,949 --> 01:39:03,248
whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1394
01:39:03,419 --> 01:39:06,354
I'II see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1395
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:10,082
I told you, my foot caught a nail.

1396
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,488
Hiyah!

1397
01:39:58,341 --> 01:39:59,865
I love this.
