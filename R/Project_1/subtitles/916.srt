1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,959
l have a friend, Deborah,
a psychologist...

2
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,294
...who was asked
by the city of Philadelphia...

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,549
...if she could offer psychological
counseling to Cambodian refugees...

4
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:53,261
...boat people,
who had recently arrived in the city.

5
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,556
Deborah was daunted by the task.
These Cambodians...

6
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:01,728
...had suffered genocide, starvation,
relatives murdered before their eyes...

7
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,648
...years in refugee camps,
harrowing boat trips to the West.

8
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,984
How could she relate
to their suffering?

9
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,819
How could she help these people?

10
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,703
So guess what all these people
wanted to talk about...

11
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,622
...with my friend Deborah,
the psychologist.

12
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,544
lt was all,
"l met this guy in the refugee camp.

13
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,547
I thought he really loved me,
but when we got separated...

14
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,300
...he took up with my cousin.
Now he says he loves me...

15
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,928
...and keeps calling me. They're
married now. What should l do?"

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,180
This is how we are.

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,556
May I help you?

18
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,392
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing
a magazine article on Bali.

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,019
I wanted to meet a medicine man.

20
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,272
Everyone said I should meet
Ketut Liyer. Am l in the right place?

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,523
Wait.

22
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:52,028
l mean, here I am with
a ninth-generation medicine man...

23
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,697
...and what do I wanna
ask him about?

24
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,200
Getting closer to God?

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,912
Saving the world's
starving children?

26
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,207
Happy to see you. l am Ketut Liyer.

27
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:09,295
Nope. l wanna discuss
my relationship.

28
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,134
You are a world traveler.

29
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,386
You will live a long time...

30
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,890
...have many friends,
many experiences.

31
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,145
You will have two marriages.
One long, one short.

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,272
Am l in the long one
or the short one?

33
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,358
Can't tell.

34
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:34,487
Also you will lose all your money.

35
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,825
I think in next six to 1 0 months.

36
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,204
Don't worry.
You will get it all back again.

37
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,290
And you will come back to Bali...

38
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:52,755
...and live here for three or four
months and teach me English.

39
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,384
I never had anybody
to practice my English with.

40
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,719
And then...

41
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:04,267
...l will teach you everything l know.

42
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,938
Wait.

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,069
I have this for you.

44
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,698
Keep grounded so it's like
you have four legs.

45
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,367
That way, you can stay in this world.

46
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,913
Also, no looking at world
through your head.

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,499
Look through your heart instead.

48
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,793
That way, you will know God.

49
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,463
Which is why you came here, no?

50
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,051
See you later, alligator.

51
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,819
I proofread all of her manuscripts.

52
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,489
My wife is very, very beautiful,
but she can't spell for anything.

53
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,326
Look at Uncle Stephen.

54
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,995
And Auntie Liz.

55
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,874
I'm counting the minutes for this to be
over so l can get in my big girl pants.

56
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,001
You look fantastic.
You just had a baby.

57
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,170
Oh, you're lying.
I'm fat, I'm exhausted...

58
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,881
...l can't keep two thoughts.
I feel like Liza Minnelli.

59
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,716
Stephen, can you hold Jack?

60
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,218
-l'm gonna introduce you to Walter.
-Yeah.

61
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,431
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer
or something?

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,309
My new book comes out in April.
Thank you for asking.

63
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,518
-Great.
-May.

64
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,020
May. May.

65
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,482
This is Andre. You two are
Times' Most Notable nominees.

66
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,360
-So glad to finally meet you.
-Nice to finally meet you.

67
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,072
I fed him nachos. ls that bad?

68
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,741
You look comfortable.
What'd you feed him, chloroform?

69
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,868
-Give him to his dad.
-l told you, nachos.

70
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,579
Know what? I'd be asleep too
if l had a dump like that.

71
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,749
-We'll give him to his mom.
-Come here then.

72
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,503
-Wanna help me change his diaper?
-Yes, I do.

73
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,546
Hey, how's the vintage car
thing going?

74
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,508
Oh, no, no, no. l changed jobs.
I'm a pastry chef now.

75
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,802
-You mean you're a baker.
-Yeah.

76
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,720
You wanna get baked?

77
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,849
I know, I know.

78
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,060
It's hard, isn't it?

79
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,356
Oh, no. This is so much fun.

80
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,526
Did you know the exact moment
you wanted to have a baby?

81
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:23,197
I can't remember, but l've had the box
since before l got married.

82
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,907
What box?

83
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,202
It's girly and embarrassing,
and you'll laugh at me if I tell you.

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,664
I will laugh at you,
but you still have to tell me.

85
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,000
Come on.

86
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,168
Under the bed.

87
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,261
I've been filling it with baby things...

88
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,264
...waiting until Andy
was ready to be a father.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,227
So sweet.

90
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,062
Does this come in my size?

91
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,613
I have a box just like this, except
it's filled with National Geographics...

92
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,949
...and The Times travel section.

93
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,244
All the places l wanna see
before l die.

94
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,874
Liz, having a baby is like
getting a tattoo on your face.

95
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,461
You kind of wanna be
fully committed.

96
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,801
So my trip to Aruba next week,
which is just a basic, you know...

97
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,596
..."where to sleep, swim
and stuff your face" piece....

98
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,222
I got a new bikini.

99
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,893
And it turns out,
I have unlimited minibar access.

100
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,895
-You know what that means?
-Jet lag?

101
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,773
You, me...

102
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,316
...macadamia nuts.

103
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,943
That was cute.

104
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,322
You know who l was talking to
at the party who was really inspiring...

105
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,865
-...was Tara's friend.
-Brian.

106
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,202
Brian. Unbelievable.
He's a teacher, you know that?

107
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,120
He's a substitute teacher, isn't he?

108
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,332
Yeah. He was talking about the
budget cuts that are happening now.

109
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,250
There's no money for anything.

110
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,087
There's no music classes,
there's no arts classes.

111
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,215
They're volunteering their time
to do all of this after school.

112
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,425
They're educating our kids,
you know?

113
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,470
I think you'd make
a great teacher, honey.

114
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,848
Thank you,
but I was thinking more of like...

115
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,769
...education. Getting my masters,
going back to school. l don't know.

116
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,604
You know?

117
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,488
I-- You know....

118
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,699
-Going back to school.
-l'm just thinking out loud.

119
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:38,290
I was getting the sinking feeling that
Ketut's prophecy was coming true.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,127
Was l in the shorter marriage?

121
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,881
We'd only bought this house
a year ago.

122
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,967
Hadn't I wanted this?

123
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,723
I had actively participated
in every moment of the creation...

124
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,725
...of this life.

125
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,229
So why didn't I see myself
in any of it?

126
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,572
The only thing more impossible
than staying...

127
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,615
...was leaving.

128
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:17,413
I didn't wanna hurt anybody. l wanted
to slip quietly out the back door...

129
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:21,083
...and not stop running
until l reached Greenland.

130
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,090
lnstead, l made a decision.

131
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,426
To pray.

132
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,096
You know, like, to God.

133
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:39,351
And it was such a foreign concept to
me, that l swear l almost began with:

134
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,520
"l'm a big fan of your work."

135
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,821
Hello, God?

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,785
Nice to finally meet you. l....

137
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:03,959
I am sorry l've never spoken
directly to you before...

138
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,794
...but...

139
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,465
...l hope l've expressed my...

140
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,178
...ample gratitude for all
the blessings you've given...

141
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,639
...to me in my life.

142
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,984
I'm in serious trouble.

143
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,322
I don't know what to do.

144
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:37,159
I need an answer.

145
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,872
Please, tell me what to do.

146
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,335
Oh, God, help me, please.

147
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,469
Tell me what to do and l'll do it.

148
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,016
Go back to bed, Liz.

149
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,373
I don't wanna go to Aruba.

150
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,629
I don't wanna be married.

151
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,733
You know, there's a whole
divorce section downstairs.

152
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,086
-"Pepper grinder."
-She's having...

153
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,464
-...a nervous breakdown.
-This is what girls do.

154
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,133
-She's processing.
-Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?

155
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,302
That's what l would do if you left me.

156
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,845
No, you wouldn't.

157
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,723
-No, I wouldn't.
-She moved out, she filed for divorce.

158
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,185
They were together eight years.
She's got no home.

159
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,194
"Legacy."

160
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:42,618
Every word in Italian is like a truffle.
A magic trick.

161
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,163
Honey, l get it.
It's your life raft right now.

162
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,583
When Andy and l broke up
for two weeks, l bought a loom.

163
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,586
A frigging loom.
And he tried to start a microbrewery.

164
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,714
I don't know how you guys
aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.

165
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,133
Are you kidding me?
We love having you.

166
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,427
It's kind of like having
a writer in residence.

167
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,097
But you are a writer.
You should be writing something.

168
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:07,434
Maybe I could write about a woman
who goes to Italy to learn ltalian.

169
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:11,063
Call it
Carbohydrates and Conjugations.

170
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,774
I'll start looking for a place.

171
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,237
-l'm falling in love with you.
-l'm not who you think I am.

172
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,905
I'm just your fantasy.

173
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,284
No, that's bullshit. You're real.

174
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,454
Your scars, your talent.

175
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,706
The fact that
I own a piece-of-crap bar...

176
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,126
...and you accept that
that's all l'm gonna do.

177
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,669
Okay, this sucks.

178
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,338
-l second that.
-Don't be rude.

179
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,556
I love your pain.

180
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,269
And l love that when we're together,
I can make it go away.

181
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,855
-Oh, he's good.
-You're love...

182
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,692
-He's hot, there's a difference.
-...is like a hot panini.

183
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,989
And when I look into your eyes,
I hear dolphins clapping.

184
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,658
I did not write that line.

185
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,326
Here's what he doesn't know yet.

186
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,290
I disappear into the person l love.

187
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,378
I am the permeable membrane.
If l love you, you can have it all.

188
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,381
My money, my time, my body...

189
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,051
...my dog, my dog's money.

190
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,388
I will assume your debts
and project upon you...

191
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:31,727
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've
never actually cultivated in yourself.

192
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,480
I will give you all this and more...

193
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,483
...until l am so exhausted
and depleted...

194
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,486
...the only way l can recover...

195
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,197
...is by becoming infatuated
with someone else.

196
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,623
-Elizabeth, hi.
-Hi.

197
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
Oh, really?

198
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,421
How you doing?

199
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,454
Cheers.

200
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,583
-Thank you.
-l owe you an apology.

201
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,629
-For the walkouts.
-Well, l'm not everyone's cup of tea.

202
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,340
I doubt that.

203
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,093
I, on the other hand, was shit.

204
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,640
-Although l was trying very hard.
-"Shit" is a strong word.

205
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,517
Thank you.

206
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,645
You seem shorter in person
than on the stage.

207
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,730
-Really? l hear that a lot.
-Sorry.

208
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,440
It's okay.

209
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,360
It's unnerving when...

210
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,489
...a total stranger sees you
more clearly than you see yourself.

211
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,908
That's what l mean
by saying you're short.

212
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,583
Are you hearing dolphins clapping
right now?

213
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,337
I took a few liberties
with your material.

214
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,799
I give you full permission to make
fun of me. I know you're dying to.

215
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,387
You're far too charming
to make fun of.

216
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,019
I'm still hearing them.

217
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,322
Is that your guru?

218
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,284
You're joking, but, yes, it is.

219
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,495
She's beautiful.

220
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,332
Yeah. A friend told me about her.

221
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,127
I was out of work and feeling
pretty desperate for something.

222
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,130
Not the last time I was out of work,
the time before that.

223
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:10,552
And l just had this feeling like
I was looking in all the wrong places.

224
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,970
Looking for what?

225
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,347
God.

226
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,268
She has an ashram in India.
I'm dying to go, but...

227
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,772
...you know, you have to get, like,
three stages of hepatitis shots...

228
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,816
...and my insurance always runs out.

229
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,943
I'll go when the time's right.

230
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,280
There's a gathering of her students
every morning.

231
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,409
If you want,
I could take you sometime.

232
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:39,915
If you're not unnerved by 1 00
crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.

233
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,001
I need to be unnerved.

234
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,577
David. A yogi from Yonkers.

235
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,499
I didn't exactly fall in love
with the guy.

236
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,586
What happened was
I dove out of my marriage...

237
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,380
...and into David's arms...

238
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,800
...exactly the same way
a cartoon circus performer...

239
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:36,596
...dives off a high platform
and into a small cup of water...

240
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,473
...vanishing completely.

241
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,068
Your underwear, my queen.

242
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,241
He just folded my delicates.

243
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,120
Oh, my God, baby,
you are in so much trouble.

244
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,548
Thirty-six?

245
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,731
My client is simply not interested
in a divorce.

246
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,777
Is he serious?

247
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,821
Is he really representing himself?

248
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,073
One semester of law school
right here, baby.

249
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,992
Great. Well, what would it take
to interest your client?

250
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,746
Okay, so here's the deal.
You have screwed up my life...

251
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,791
...but what l wanna know
is why couldn't you find yourself...

252
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,836
...in our marriage? Why didn't you
say what you were thinking?

253
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,505
-l did. You never listened to me.
-No. You never said:

254
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,424
"Hey, you know what?
You suck. l'm deeply unhappy."

255
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,928
You just took off. You never gave me
a chance to address those problems.

256
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,931
That's not fair. That's just quitting.
I took vows.

257
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,017
Till death.
And l take them seriously.

258
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,396
I believe this is just a phase
and l'm willing to wait it out.

259
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,022
You are always waiting, Stephen.

260
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,441
Waiting for me to come home,
to wanna have kids...

261
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,278
...to make you dinner.
I don't know why we can't accept...

262
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,613
...we don't wanna live
in unhappiness anymore.

263
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,283
I accept the fact that
I am occasionally unreliable...

264
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,703
...and l often get sidetracked,
but I thought you liked that about me.

265
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,205
I thought it was okay
that I had hopes and dreams.

266
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,959
Have a dream. Stephen, great,
fine. Do that. Just pick one.

267
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,128
Okay, l pick one. I pick you.

268
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,348
I know this is awful.

269
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,396
But l believe with every molecule of
my body that you will find the person...

270
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,149
...that wants just what you want.

271
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,652
That will give you what you want
and what you deserve. l'm not her.

272
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,157
Well, you obviously know nothing
about what l want.

273
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,495
My client would like to submit
a song he wrote...

274
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:52,000
...that he believes is relevant to these
proceedings. Goes something like this:

275
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,628
Are you kidding?

276
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,134
Quitter, quitter, quitter!

277
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,262
How about l take the blame?
I am the one who couldn't deal...

278
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,432
...with another weekend roaming
some box-shaped superstore...

279
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,142
...buying appliances on credit...

280
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,480
...and pretending to be a couple that
neither one of us ever knew how to be.

281
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,023
You wanted that toaster.

282
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:20,528
"You like faking it, fine. You're stellar.
I'm the failure. l suck at faking it."

283
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,698
-lt was not my finest hour.
-So where do things stand now?

284
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,284
We're prepared
to offer half of everything...

285
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,496
...and my client's retirement accounts.

286
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,874
Take it all then. Everything.

287
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,377
He still said no.

288
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,672
-He hates me now.
-He doesn't hate you.

289
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,216
His heart is broken.

290
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,887
I think he hates you.

291
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,014
I'm never letting you
out of the basement.

292
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,434
Why don't we talk next week
and we'll see where things stand?

293
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,186
-Okay.
-These things have a way...

294
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,980
...of working themselves out.

295
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,830
So why'd you become a vegetarian?

296
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,249
I saw some cows slaughtered
one time.

297
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,251
Barely touched your dinner.

298
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,753
He's 28.

299
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,676
This is hard for him, isn't it?
And you?

300
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,178
The meditations help.

301
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,764
Liz.

302
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:33,226
You remember a couple of years ago,
when you threw yourself into...

303
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,062
...the renovation of your kitchen?
You were consumed...

304
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,148
...with being the perfect wife and cook.

305
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,733
I was trying to make it work.

306
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,777
Well, l think chanting and meditation
is the same thing...

307
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,612
...in a different costume.

308
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,951
Definitely give me that documentary.

309
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,078
I've been thinking
about vegetarianism.

310
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,205
My triglycerides
are through the roof.

311
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,707
Yeah. Thanks for everything.

312
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,917
Great to meet you.

313
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:06,176
-What?
-Nothing. lt's just...

314
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,303
...you know,
you used to look like Stephen.

315
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,805
Now you kind of look like David.

316
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,599
You know?

317
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:18,146
What l meant was, you know how
people start resembling their dogs?

318
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,109
Why would he say that,
we look like the same dog?

319
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,819
-He was joking.
-Not funny.

320
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,530
Well, he had five Heinekens.
He was bombed.

321
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,908
Well, not funny.

322
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,535
We don't look like the same dog.

323
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:38,792
If anything, you're a collie
and l'm a Tibetan mastiff.

324
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:51,971
Don't you wanna give me a chance
to miss you?

325
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,829
It begins when
the object of your affection...

326
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,541
...bestows upon you
a heady hallucinogenic dose...

327
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,710
...of something you've never
even dared to admit you wanted...

328
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,798
...an emotional speedball
of thunderous love and excitement.

329
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:30,260
Soon you start craving that attention
with the hungry obsession...

330
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,053
...of any junkie.

331
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:35,723
When it's withheld, you turn sick,
crazy, not to mention resentful...

332
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,060
...of the dealer who encouraged
this addiction in the first place...

333
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,604
...but now refuses to pony up
the good stuff.

334
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,732
Just frustrated, l'm concerned.
I don't understand.

335
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,401
What don't you get?

336
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,653
What's going on?
You don't look me in the eye.

337
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,197
-You don't finish your--
-Nobody's asking you to make the bed!

338
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,117
-You don't have sex with me!
-Sometimes I'm not in the mood!

339
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,911
Goddamn him, and he used to
give it to you for free.

340
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,081
Next stage finds you skinny,
shaking in a corner...

341
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,250
...certain only that
you'd sell your soul...

342
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,502
...just to have that one thing
one more time.

343
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,297
Well, then why don't we discuss it?
Why don't we sort it?

344
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,800
-Why don't we act like adults?
-Okay. Can I have a little space?

345
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,594
-How about that?
-Meanwhile...

346
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,180
...the object of your adoration
is now repulsed by you.

347
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,225
-You don't always make me miserable.
-There's a comfort.

348
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,854
I just-- Sometimes l need to
come home...

349
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,273
...and have a little David time.

350
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,776
He looks at you like someone
he's never met before.

351
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,695
-ls that okay?
-Yeah. No, it's fine.

352
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,948
And not have to, like, you know,
justify it.

353
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,243
The irony is
you can hardly blame him.

354
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,788
I mean, check yourself out.
You're a mess.

355
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,458
Unrecognizable
even to your own eyes.

356
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,627
You asked me to come here?
Here l am.

357
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,629
And it turned into something else.

358
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,256
-Didn't it?
-You are such a child.

359
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,805
-Right. I can't take this anymore.
-Great. Perfect.

360
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,309
That's a great response
to a conversation.

361
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,518
Goddamn it.

362
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:07,607
You have now reached
infatuation's final destination.

363
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:14,447
The complete
and merciless devaluation of self.

364
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,024
You wanna go away for a year?

365
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,318
Do you know what I felt
when l woke up, Delia?

366
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:57,073
Nothing. No passion, no spark,
no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.

367
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,451
I've gotten past the point where
I can be calling this a bad moment.

368
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,955
And it just terrifies me. Jesus,
this is like worse than death to me...

369
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,958
...the idea that this is the person
I'm gonna be from now on.

370
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,418
This happens to people.

371
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,670
They fall in love in their 20s,
get married...

372
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,798
...do the granite countertop,
white-picket fence in their 30s...

373
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,342
...and somewhere they realize,
"This is not for me."

374
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,013
So they fail and they fall down,
they hurt like hell, they straighten up...

375
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,432
...and march their asses
to the shrink's office.

376
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,102
-They can't just check out.
-l am not checking out.

377
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,770
I need to change.

378
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,189
You have a support system
here, Liz.

379
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,191
You have friends and family
who love you.

380
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,029
And do you feel my love for you?
My support for you? No.

381
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,698
There's, like, nothing. l have no pulse.

382
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,661
-l am going to Italy.
-ltaly. Why ltaly?

383
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,289
-What did you have for lunch?
-l don't know. A salad.

384
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:51,669
Exactly. l used to have this appetite
for food, for my life...

385
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,962
...and it is just gone.

386
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,843
I wanna go someplace
where l can marvel at something.

387
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,430
Language, gelato,
spaghetti, something.

388
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,516
-You're talking like a college kid.
-l've been acting like one.

389
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,228
Since I was 1 5, I've either been
with a guy or breaking up with a guy.

390
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,356
I have not given myself
two weeks of a breather...

391
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,818
...to just deal with, you know, myself.

392
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,031
What's going on
with you and David?

393
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,749
What, did you fall out?

394
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,126
I don't know how to be here.

395
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,922
You wanna know how to be here?
Stop constantly waiting for something.

396
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:45,306
I'm going to Italy and then l'm going
to David's guru's ashram in lndia...

397
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,893
...and l'm going to end the year
in Bali.

398
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,439
That's what l'm gonna do.

399
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,275
That's harder to argue with.
The beaches are nice. But why?

400
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,444
-Ketut told me I would.
-Guy with no teeth.

401
00:28:58,612 --> 00:28:59,695
When you're desperate...

402
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,365
...and some guy who,
yes, looks a little like Yoda...

403
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,785
...hands you a prophecy,
you have to respond.

404
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,121
-Do you need a Xanax?
-Always.

405
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,458
Okay, l'm just gonna say it.
I'm gonna say it and be done with it.

406
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,709
What if it doesn't work?

407
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,050
My whole life
fits in a 1 2-foot-square box.

408
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,471
You know how many times
I hear that in a day?

409
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,932
Most of them never come back
for their whole life.

410
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,980
-Hello?
-Liz.

411
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,108
Good news. Stephen just signed
the divorce papers.

412
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:50,037
I'll probably be back in a week,
penniless with dysentery.

413
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,081
You're my hero.

414
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,180
Hey.

415
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,309
If you stay,
we'll go out for lndian every night.

416
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,271
You never asked me to stay.

417
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,446
Go, go, go.

418
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,176
You know what's funny?

419
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,971
This is the first time in my life
there's no one waiting at home for me.

420
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,015
I don't even have a home
to come back to.

421
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,516
Oh, God. You'll make friends.

422
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,810
You'll make friends with a backpack,
of course.

423
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,437
It'd be great to get away.

424
00:30:56,605 --> 00:31:00,775
Andy and l were talking about getting
a little villa in Florence for a month.

425
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,611
You know, and in 1 0 years,
when Jack is older....

426
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,947
What?

427
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,952
You know why l was giving you
such a hard time?

428
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,706
I love my job, my guy and my kid,
but....

429
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,627
I wish I could go.

430
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,304
I love you and l'm proud of you.

431
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,848
Now go.

432
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,332
There is a wonderful
old Italian joke...

433
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,835
...about a poor man
who goes to church every day...

434
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:05,339
...and prays before the statue
of a great saint, begging:

435
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:12,138
"Dear saint, please, please, please
let me win the lottery."

436
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,766
Finally, the exasperated statue
comes to life...

437
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,144
...and looks down at the begging man
and says:

438
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:23,733
"My son, please, please, please
buy a ticket."

439
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,360
So now l get the joke.

440
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,155
And l've got three tickets.

441
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,678
You heat the water on the stove.

442
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,891
So if I want to bathe...?

443
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,063
You put the water in the tub.

444
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,400
Okay.

445
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:13,157
Yeah. lt doesn't really seem like
enough water to bathe in.

446
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,745
Not enough.

447
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,663
Yes, it's enough.

448
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,209
Fill it up three, four, five times.

449
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,921
Everything that's important
gets cleaned.

450
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,606
Is this safe? This...

451
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,110
...scaffolding? Scaffol--

452
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,278
It holds up the ceiling.

453
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,657
Otherwise it will fall apart.

454
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,951
Everything falls apart, my dear.

455
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,789
The only thing permanent in life
is family.

456
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,086
You're not married.

457
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,214
No, divorziata.

458
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,258
Why divorced?

459
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,596
We broke it.

460
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,144
You're more happy now?

461
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,108
I have one rule.

462
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:34,822
No strange men spending the night.

463
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,700
You American girls
when you come to ltaly...

464
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,202
...all you want is pasta...

465
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,413
...and sausage.

466
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,335
I'll take it.

467
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,962
Good. You chose well.

468
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,206
Cappuccino.

469
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,542
-lt's a zoo in here.
-And my ltalian sucks.

470
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,212
-How long have you been here?
-Two weeks. You?

471
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,297
Six weeks. You'll get better.

472
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,216
Two cappuccinos, please.

473
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,092
And warm the milk this time.

474
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,303
Yesterday it was too hot
and burned my tongue.

475
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,764
-You like Napoleons?
-Of course.

476
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,308
And two Napoleons, please.

477
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,144
Your Italian is fantastic.

478
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,689
I have a wonderful tutor.
I'll give you his number if you like.

479
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,442
-He's really good and he needs work.
-Oh, great.

480
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,527
Are you Dutch? German?

481
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,323
Swedish. Even colder people,
if you can imagine.

482
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,868
-l'm Liz, by the way.
-Sofi.

483
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,663
You can say:

484
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,919
It's past.

485
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,016
Too fast, but okay.

486
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,309
You can say:

487
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,521
Yeah.

488
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,198
What a beautiful word.

489
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,701
Come on, it's "let's cross over."
It's so ordinary.

490
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,873
No, it's the perfect combination
of ltalian sounds.

491
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:17,211
It's the wistful "ah," the rolling trill,
the soothing "ess."

492
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,380
-That's true.
-l love it.

493
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,091
All right, let me teach you a word.

494
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:32,017
Therapist.

495
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,977
-Come on.
-Good. You gotta learn humor.

496
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,646
-lt's not.
-Come on. Cheers.

497
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,240
-Shall we continue Tuesday at 5?
-Yes.

498
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,576
-With another bottle of the therapy?
-Of course.

499
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,121
-You're doing very well, Liz.
-Thank you.

500
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,456
And you must be very polite
with yourself...

501
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,125
...when you learn something new.

502
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,085
Yes. Grazie, I agree.

503
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,797
But your English-- How are you
even talking to me like this right now?

504
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,508
I think you're gonna teach me
more than I teach you.

505
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,593
You have good Italian. Very good.

506
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,220
All right.

507
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,808
I am alone.

508
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,263
I feel so guilty.
I've been in Rome for three weeks...

509
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,932
...all l've done is learn
a few ltalian words and eat.

510
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,934
You feel guilty
because you're American.

511
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,978
You don't know
how to enjoy yourself.

512
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,355
-l beg your pardon?
-lt's true.

513
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,775
Americans know entertainment,
but don't know pleasure.

514
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,195
This is Luca Spaghetti, by the way,
you know.

515
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,906
Your name is Luca Spaghetti?

516
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,950
Yes, that's what our family is called.

517
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,953
We invented it.
I'm serious. Listen to me.

518
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,497
You want to know your problem?
Americans.

519
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,083
You work too hard.
You get burned out.

520
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,919
Then you come home
and spend the whole weekend...

521
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,714
...in your pajamas in front of the TV.

522
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,633
That's not far off, actually.

523
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,970
But you don't know pleasure.
You have to be told you've earned it.

524
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,057
You see a commercial that says,
"It's Miller time"...

525
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,311
...and you say, "That's right.
Now I will go to buy a six-pack."

526
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:49,316
And drink the whole thing and wake up
the next morning and you feel terrible.

527
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,319
But an ltalian doesn't need
to be told.

528
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:56,698
He walks by a sign that says,
"you deserve a break today"...

529
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,325
...and he says, "Yeah, l know.

530
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,329
That's why I'm planning on
taking a break at noon...

531
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,749
...to go over to your house
and sleep with your wife."

532
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,836
We call it "dolce far niente."

533
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,421
It means...

534
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:15,509
...the sweetness of doing nothing.
We are masters of it.

535
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,232
He's right. He says...

536
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,150
...you can't learn ltalian like this.

537
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,738
You don't speak the language just with
your mouth, speak it with your hands.

538
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,948
Like this?

539
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,204
Okay. ls yelling.

540
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,459
'THAT MEAL WAS EXCELLENT'

541
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,054
'SUCK IT'

542
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,016
All this gives me a stomachache.

543
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,436
'SCREW YOU'

544
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,231
-l think that's my neighbor Lorenzo.
-Charming.

545
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,195
ANOTHER WAY
TO SAY 'SCREW YOU'

546
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,542
So anyway, to start off l'd say....

547
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,377
Excuse me.

548
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,962
Come here.

549
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,674
For the table...

550
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,927
...a big platter
of artichoke alla giudia...

551
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,596
...prosciutto with melon...

552
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,140
...and eggplant
with ricotta affumicata.

553
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,018
Then spaghetti alla carbonara...

554
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,771
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...

555
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,898
...and linguini with clams.

556
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,275
Then tripe alla romana...

557
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,443
...and saltimbocca.

558
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,613
And two more liters
of the vino sfuso from Genzano.

559
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,072
Thank you.

560
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:06,286
You did it. Yes.

561
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,455
Liz Gilbert,
you are a Roman woman now.

562
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,916
No, only honorary.

563
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,043
That is a real Roman woman.

564
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,424
Yeah, with a lot
of international friends.

565
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,134
That one, I'd bite.

566
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,846
Maybe you and Rome
just have different words.

567
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,640
-Different words?
-Yeah.

568
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:30,477
Yeah. lt's like each city has a word,
if you really think about it.

569
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,480
Like, what is the word for London?

570
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,107
-l would say "stuffy."
-l would agree with that.

571
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,653
-What's the word for Stockholm?
-Are you kidding? "Conform."

572
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,112
And New York?

573
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,658
"Ambition" or "soot."

574
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,160
What's the word for Rome?

575
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,412
It's kind of difficult to think about.

576
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,789
It's classic.

577
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,457
"Sex."

578
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,670
Of course.

579
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,700
So, what's your word, Liz?
I'm curious. l can't figure it out.

580
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,535
Well....

581
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,373
It might be....

582
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:39,045
It started as "daughter."
I was good at that. And then...

583
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,382
..."wife." Not so good.

584
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,384
"Girlfriend."

585
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,053
Not so good.

586
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,680
My word's "writer."

587
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:52,350
Yeah, but that's what you do.
That isn't who you are, no?

588
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:55,020
Maybe you're a woman
in search of her word.

589
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:12,579
Hey, Sofi, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples.
Maybe my word is "pizza."

590
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,680
Listen, lady, I am only 7, but l
can tell you're a complete moron...

591
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,183
...because I am from Naples.

592
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,061
I love this place,
but Giovanni said to watch out.

593
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,772
His cousin got mugged here
in a museum.

594
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,441
-Are you serious?
-Watch out for the scooter. Yeah.

595
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,959
I'm in love. l'm having
a relationship with my pizza.

596
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:02,420
You look like you're breaking up
with the pizza. What's the matter?

597
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,797
I can't.

598
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,424
What do you mean, you can't?
This is pizza in Napoli.

599
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,760
It is your moral imperative
to eat that pizza.

600
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,264
I want to,
but I've gained, like, 1 0 pounds.

601
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,433
I mean, l've got this....

602
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,811
Right here. What's it called?
What's the word?

603
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,313
A muffin top.

604
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,816
I have one too.

605
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,735
I unbuttoned my jeans
five minutes ago just looking at this.

606
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,195
Let me ask you a question.

607
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,448
In all the years you've ever
undressed in front of a gentleman....

608
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,285
-Hasn't been that many.
-All right, well...

609
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,329
...has he ever asked you to leave?

610
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,290
-Has he ever walked out? Left?
-No.

611
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,126
Because he doesn't care.

612
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,004
He's in a room with a naked girl.
He's won the lottery.

613
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:48,008
I'm so tired of saying no
and then waking up in the morning...

614
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,136
...and recalling every single thing
I ate the day before.

615
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,346
Counting every calorie
so l know exactly...

616
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,474
...how much self-loathing
to take into the shower.

617
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,518
I'm going for it.

618
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,022
I have no interest in being obese.
I'm just through with the guilt.

619
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,983
This is what l'm gonna do.
I'm gonna finish this pizza...

620
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,986
...and then we're gonna go
watch the soccer game.

621
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,572
And tomorrow we're gonna go
on a little date...

622
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,159
...and buy ourselves
some bigger jeans.

623
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,829
Giovanni likes a muffin.

624
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,208
Attagirl.

625
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,892
He's saying,
"For whom are you playing?"

626
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,310
Per chi, for whom.

627
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:50,111
Pull, pull. l'm sucking it in.

628
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,531
Put some Swedish muscle into this.

629
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,913
You think this happened
to Sophia Loren?

630
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,539
There it goes. Almost got it.

631
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,418
Go, go, go. You're not trying.

632
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,048
I've almost got it. l've almost got it.
I did it.

633
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,074
Oh, that's beautiful.
You should get it.

634
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,369
For whom?

635
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:42,622
For you, Liz. Just for you.

636
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,962
No, I'm happy just
with my big lady pants.

637
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,398
Thanks for the day.
And the leg room.

638
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,317
It was fun.

639
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,113
We're gonna go for food.
Wanna come?

640
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,824
No. No, l'm good.

641
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,679
The sweetness of doing nothing.

642
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,736
Please. Please get off the floor.

643
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,039
Will you please just...?
Will you come up here?

644
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:02,512
What if we just acknowledge that
we have a screwed-up relationship...

645
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,556
...and we stick it out anyway?

646
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,103
We accept that we fight a lot...

647
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,106
...and we hardly have sex anymore...

648
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:17,026
...but that we don't wanna
live without each other.

649
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,655
And that way we can spend
our lives together...

650
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,865
...miserable...

651
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,953
...but happy not to be apart.

652
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,713
Dear David:

653
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,965
We haven't had any communication
in a while...

654
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,135
...and it's given me time
I needed to think.

655
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,888
Remember when you said we should
live with each other and be unhappy...

656
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,390
...so we could be happy?

657
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,809
Consider it a testimony
to how much I love you...

658
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,645
...that I spent so long
pouring myself into that offer...

659
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,981
...trying to make it work.

660
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,318
But a friend took me to the most
amazing place the other day.

661
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,986
It's called the Augusteum.

662
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,906
Octavian Augustus built it
to house his remains.

663
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:07,493
When the barbarians came, they
trashed it along with everything else.

664
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:11,164
The great Augustus,
Rome's first true great emperor...

665
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,291
...how could he have imagined
that Rome...

666
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:17,003
...the whole world, as far as he was
concerned, would be in ruins?

667
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:20,923
During the Dark Ages, someone came
in here and stole the emperor's ashes.

668
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,593
In the 12th century,
it became a fortress...

669
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,136
...then a bullring.

670
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,305
They stored fireworks in here
after that.

671
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,683
Nowadays, it's a bathroom
for the homeless...

672
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:33,686
...so you better watch your step
going down.

673
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,693
It's one of the quietest
and loneliest places in Rome.

674
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,322
The city has grown up
around it over centuries.

675
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,491
It feels like a precious wound...

676
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,370
...like a heartbreak you won't let go of
because it hurts too good.

677
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,705
I like it messy.

678
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,042
We all want things
to stay the same, David.

679
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,878
I guess the guy before me
must've been some angel, huh?

680
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,421
Settle for living in misery...

681
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,674
...because we're afraid of change,
of things crumbling to ruins.

682
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:08,388
Then I looked around in this place,
at the chaos it's endured...

683
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,391
...the way it's been adapted,
burned, pillaged...

684
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:15,812
...then found a way to build itself
back up again, and I was reassured.

685
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,232
Maybe my life hasn't been so chaotic.
It's just the world that is...

686
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,027
...and the only real trap
is getting attached to any of it.

687
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,239
Ruin is a gift.

688
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,575
Ruin is the road to transformation.

689
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,411
Hey.

690
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,579
You ready?

691
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,332
Yeah.

692
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:46,217
Even in this eternal city,
the Augusteum showed me...

693
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:50,763
...that we must always be prepared
for endless waves of transformation.

694
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,520
Both of us deserve better
than staying together...

695
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,898
...because we're afraid
we'll be destroyed if we don't.

696
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,709
My mother's stuffing.
Stale bread, walnuts, got those.

697
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,128
Will you get me
some more potatoes?

698
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,339
Oh, l'm always getting you
more potatoes.

699
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,800
It's my dream,
a real American Thanksgiving.

700
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:13,179
The perfect way to say goodbye
to our Liz.

701
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,349
So...

702
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,560
-...you leave this week, huh?
-Yes.

703
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,813
And where are you going? lran?

704
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,690
India.

705
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:29,445
Liz is making us
an American meal tonight.

706
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,573
-You are not married, yeah?
-No.

707
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,494
What's wrong with your friend,
is she a lesbian?

708
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,542
No, Mama, she's not a lesbian.
And she understands ltalian.

709
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,877
How's she going to find
another husband and start a family...

710
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,713
...when she's on the other side
of the world?

711
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:53,553
If a man said, "l'm going to travel for
a year and meet wonderful people...."

712
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,221
But she's not a man.

713
00:57:55,764 --> 00:58:01,018
It's more difficult for a woman to feel
that she has the right to make choices.

714
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,896
-lt takes a lot of courage.
-Exactly.

715
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,233
You call it courage, I call it stupidity.

716
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,193
Mama, enough.

717
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,613
I know a number of people
who would agree with you.

718
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,241
Luca?

719
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,410
What time will the turkey be ready?

720
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,704
The turkey....

721
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,247
I haven't defrosted it yet.

722
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,627
Oh, shit.

723
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,422
You only had one thing to do
and you screwed it up.

724
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,883
I was distracted! It can happen!

725
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,885
Too much good food!

726
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,887
Too many women!

727
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,973
And l forgot!

728
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,267
Now, before we eat, everyone...

729
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:44,395
...it is Thanksgiving,
so let us give thanks.

730
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,273
-Yeah. Come on, join hands.
-Okay.

731
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,567
So we just say what we....

732
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,654
What we thank God for tonight.
Sofi, why don't you start?

733
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,452
I am grateful for you, Liz...

734
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:03,956
...for helping me appreciate life...

735
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,460
...with all that comes with it...

736
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:11,213
...muffin tops and bad times.

737
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,923
And for Giovanni...

738
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,052
...for making me feel...

739
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,803
...loved and secure.

740
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,641
And Giulio.

741
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,686
Me, l'm grateful for
my beautiful family.

742
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,230
My two little daughters and my wife.

743
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,735
I thank God and the Holy Virgin...

744
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,904
...for this very, very special day.

745
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,991
And for this beautiful family...

746
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,910
...that today is so much bigger.

747
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,496
Very much bigger.

748
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,505
I thank you all for this new custom
of celebration.

749
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,257
And Liz's stuffing...

750
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,385
...and God...

751
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,845
...for my sexiness.

752
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:04,433
And you, Ruffina?

753
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:11,524
I thank God for...

754
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:13,526


755
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,824
Go ahead. Giovanni.

756
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,493
I thank God for...

757
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,329
...fear...

758
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:29,375
...because for the first time...

759
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,087
...l'm afraid the person next to me...

760
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,173
...will be the one who wants to leave.

761
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,431
Liz?

762
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:50,187
Well, this all makes me so grateful.

763
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,566
Seeing all you happy people...

764
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,278
...who know how to love each other
and take care of each other.

765
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:03,200
I look at the amazing women l've met
who l admire so much...

766
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:08,456
...and the great men,
taking care of their women...

767
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,459
...and putting their children to bed.

768
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,296
I just feel happy...

769
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:19,467
...to see it and to be part of it.

770
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:27,308
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

771
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,565
It's a good breakfast, huh?

772
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,944
I will take this to your room.

773
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,951
It has already started.

774
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,958
-l fell asleep.
-Yeah. Pity.

775
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:25,337
Probably the only person in the world
who ever fell asleep during meditation.

776
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:36,557
-This leads to the meditation garden.
-ls the guru here?

777
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:40,102
-She's always here.
-l know, but is she "here" here?

778
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,354
She's at her ashram in New York.

779
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,898
But l came from New York
to see her here.

780
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,735
Sounds like one of her little tricks.

781
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,741
The meditation cave.

782
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:58,954
It's open 24/7
and it's air-conditioned.

783
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,464
Corella?

784
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:12,468
-This is Liz Gilbert.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

785
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,433
-Where did you get that button?
-They sell them in the bookstore.

786
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:23,187
That is exactly what I need. I need
something like that. l don't listen.

787
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,273
I never have. My mom used to
call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...

788
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,358
...because I just ramble.
I am a rambler.

789
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,403
I am rambling now. l'm sorry.

790
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,114
Silence is a wonderful
spiritual practice...

791
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,077
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell
you it's more challenging than it looks.

792
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,121
-Wait till you've been here for a while.
-Okay.

793
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:56,136
Thank you, Corella.
I'll be sure to tell her.

794
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,639
-What did she say?
-No idea.

795
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,475
Change into your work clothes.
I'll take you to your seva.

796
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,311
It's a Hindu word
for "selfless devotional work."

797
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:08,524
-lt's required of everyone who stays.
-Okay. Thank you.

798
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,679
Is there anything in this world skinnier
than an lndian teenage boy?

799
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,142
-l'm Tulsi.
-Liz.

800
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:44,852
Where are you from?

801
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:48,981
The next town. My parents have been
devotees of the guru for many years.

802
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,524
We spend a lot of time here.

803
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,359
But...

804
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,946
...they are trying to marry me off.
That's the custom.

805
01:07:56,114 --> 01:08:00,492
-That's not what you want?
-No way. lt sucks.

806
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:10,210
I want to study psychology, just as our
guru did when she attended college.

807
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,547
I prefer to be with God
than boys my age.

808
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:17,342
No one in my family understands
my coming all the way to India.

809
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:21,847
Do you ever look at them and wonder,
"What am I doing in this family?"

810
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:24,224
You have no idea.

811
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:55,589
The Guru Gita is an ancient text
1 82 verses long.

812
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,884
In it, the goddess Parvati
is asking Shiva, or God...

813
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,261
...for the secrets of fulfillment.

814
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,474
It's said to have
transforming qualities.

815
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:09,311
I would just like to take a risk here
and say....

816
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,690
Me and Guru Gita,
we just do not get along.

817
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,693
-What is it you have trouble with?
-Everything.

818
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,988
It's long, it's tedious,
I can't keep up...

819
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,993
...and l get these insane anxieties
about everything in my life...

820
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,912
...and l've lost my place.

821
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,997
Sounds like it has a positive effect...

822
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,584
...if you're having such strong
emotions and physical reactions.

823
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,879
You keep trying.

824
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,181
It is most commendable
that you ended your marriage.

825
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,267
You seem like such a
happy, free person now.

826
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,479
I think my ex-husband
would describe me as selfish.

827
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,150
You mustn't be angry with yourself
or disappointed.

828
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:01,321
You don't have to make children
or be married to have a family.

829
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,159
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes
here big enough...

830
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,662
...to stand flat-footed
and screw a chicken.

831
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,165
-l love you.
-Liz, have you met...

832
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,668
-...Richard from Texas?
-Hello, Richard from Texas.

833
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:17,170
-Nice to meet you, Groceries.
-Groceries?

834
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:20,507
Yeah. Yeah, l heard you eating
before l saw you.

835
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,510
I never seen anybody
eat so much at one time.

836
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,013
You sure do enjoy your groceries.

837
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:30,809
You know, it's been a rough day,
and if no one takes it personally...

838
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,813
...l'm going to take my large meal
someplace else to eat it in silence.

839
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,149
Oh, no, stay. I'm done.

840
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,655
Looked like you were
working through some...

841
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,491
...pretty rough stuff this morning.

842
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,535
Stuff with your ex-husband?

843
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:51,496
I got an ex-wife.

844
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,167
She thinks l changed my name
to "Motherfucker."

845
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,380
I--

846
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:05,886
I just spent some time in Rome
and l came here feeling so great.

847
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:09,514
And now here l am, at the source...

848
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,559
...and l feel more disconnected
than ever.

849
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,020
Why'd you come here?

850
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:17,898
I just want some peace.

851
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:20,233
Peace?

852
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,529
You wanna get
to the castle, Groceries...

853
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:26,281
...you got to swim the moat.

854
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,579
Here, you can finish that.
I know you can.

855
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,087
Okay.

856
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,299
Simply empty your mind.

857
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:45,926
Breathe.

858
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:51,389
What am l going to do
when this year is over?

859
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,266
Where am I going to live?

860
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:54,726
Well, maybe Chicago.

861
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,397
Oh, my God.
I could build a meditation room--

862
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,568
No. Stop thinking.
Why is this so hard?

863
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,743
Screw you, Corella.
How the hell does she do this?

864
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,538
She looks like
frigging Mother Teresa.

865
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,459
Oh, my God, kill me.

866
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,131
-Who's in the moat today?
-Shut up.

867
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,466
Sounds like you wrestled
some big-ass crocs.

868
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,886
You know what? lf you're so goddamn
smart, what are you doing here?

869
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,972
If you're here,
it makes you smart already.

870
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,433
-Do you wanna talk about what--?
-No, not to you. Thank you.

871
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,645
I'm the only one here. You're gonna
talk about it sooner or later.

872
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:39,938
I cannot focus in there.

873
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,359
All I think about is my meditation room
and how to decorate.

874
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,487
Are you shitting me?

875
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,322
Are you kidding me?

876
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,826
The meditation room is within,
Groceries. Decorate that.

877
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,786
Do you always talk
in bumper sticker?

878
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,329
I do, and here's another one.

879
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:59,499
You have to learn to select
your thoughts the way you select...

880
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:02,502
...your clothes every day.
That's a power you can cultivate.

881
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,922
You wanna come here and control
your life so bad, work on the mind.

882
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,966
That's the only thing
you should control.

883
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,802
If you can't master your thoughts,
you're in trouble.

884
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,012
I am trying.

885
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,182
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem.
Stop trying. Surrender.

886
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,852
Go out into the garden
and just sit there and still your mind...

887
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,520
...and you watch what happens.

888
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,522
Why don't you just let it be?

889
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:27,027
Has anyone ever told you
you look like James Taylor?

890
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,908
Every day.

891
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,083
God, he really does.

892
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,882
My prayers were always the same.

893
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:53,220
"Please, God, please.
Open my heart, send me a sign...

894
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,140
...because we both know
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed."

895
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,228
Look at you,
floating through Calcutta.

896
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:04,022
Looks like you had
a great meditation.

897
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,899
I probably have malaria now.

898
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,525
The bites will go away.

899
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,903
Eventually everything goes away.

900
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,739
You ever done that, Groceries?
Begged for a sign?

901
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,076
That sounds vaguely familiar.

902
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,703
Be careful what you wish for.
You just might get it.

903
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,080
What is your problem?

904
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:24,084
Did you fall in love
with the wrong woman or something?

905
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,253
Excuse me, Miss Gilbert.

906
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,588
You have a phone call.

907
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,259
How's the Guru Gita treating you?

908
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:36,096
Fine. You'd like her.

909
01:14:37,265 --> 01:14:39,683
Did you get my e-mail?

910
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:44,354
Yeah. l'm sorry l didn't call sooner.

911
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,939
Why didn't you?

912
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,440
Because if l didn't respond...

913
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:51,611
...we were still having a conversation.
I was still in it.

914
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:57,993
I'm sorry. We were just bad timing.

915
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:04,624
I just wanted things to be easy.
We were good when things were easy.

916
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:09,129
It's not that I need "easy" right now.
I just can't have "so hard."

917
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:12,507
Well, you sound good.

918
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:14,801
Stronger.

919
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,303
So do you.

920
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,639
Yeah, well, l'm an actor, Liz.

921
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,020
I got a part.

922
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,150
It's off-Broadway,
but it's pretty cool.

923
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,485
I'm happy for you.

924
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,156
All right.

925
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:38,825
Well, l'll see you around, kid.

926
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:06,853
Check you out.

927
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,065
I have never seen you so focused.

928
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,203
You need a Thums Up.

929
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,876
No, no. No lips on the bottle.

930
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,837
First rule in lndia is never
touch anything but yourself.

931
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:41,513
Oh, good God. That's, like,
five times sweeter than Coke.

932
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,395
I think it might have
methamphetamines in it.

933
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,147
We can only hope.

934
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,069
I know you feel awful.

935
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,864
But your life's changing.

936
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,242
That's not a bad thing.

937
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:06,037
And you're in the perfect place for it.
Surrounded by grace.

938
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:11,209
I thought I was over him, but...

939
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:12,919
...l love him.

940
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,421
Big deal.

941
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,090
-So you fell in love with someone.
-l really miss him.

942
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,758
So miss him.

943
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:22,637
Send him some light and love every
time you think of him, then drop it.

944
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:27,183
You know, if you could clear out
all that space in your mind...

945
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:29,436
...that you're using
to obsess over this guy...

946
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,939
...and your failed marriage,
you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.

947
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,276
And you know what the universe
would do with that doorway?

948
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:40,947
Rush in. God would rush in.

949
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:46,286
Fill you with more love
than you ever dreamed of. Man.

950
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,292
Groceries.

951
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:56,796
I think you have the capacity someday
to love the whole world.

952
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,304
What do they sell over there?

953
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:13,313
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles.

954
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,859
I'm gonna need a lot of these.

955
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:22,655
Speaking of elephants, there's a rogue
elephant on the loose in the area.

956
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,324
He was with carnival.

957
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:28,119
They say he is very,
very unpredictable and volatile.

958
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:30,371
That just makes him more attractive
to her.

959
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,500
How'd you get to be so smart?
I'll bet it was the hard way.

960
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:34,876
Don't change the subject.

961
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:39,756
Well, when is this grieving phase
going to pass?

962
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:42,258
You want a day on a calendar
you can circle?

963
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:45,345
-Can you give me one?
-No. You got to do the work.

964
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:48,181
Meditate and go to seva...

965
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,559
...and most important, get your butt
down to the Geet every morning...

966
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,019
...and something'll change.

967
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:57,190
I just cannot get through the Guru Gita.
I can't find that feeling of devotion.

968
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:01,444
Okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody
or something you wanna devote it to.

969
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,864
It doesn't have to be the guru.
It's all the same to her.

970
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,242
This is about you.

971
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:13,540
Can l tell you something, Groceries?
You got some serious control issues.

972
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,542
Is it obvious?

973
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:19,671
All right, Richard,
get out from inside my head now.

974
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:20,880
Shut the door.

975
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:26,052
-That's him?
-That's him.

976
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:31,224
-He's hideous.
-No, he's not. He's cute.

977
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:32,767
He's a Sagittarius.

978
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,353
He studies computer programming
in Delhi.

979
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,355
He has very good grades.

980
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:40,900
And his family is very, very wealthy.

981
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:46,906
He will be very conceited
and dictatorial.

982
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,909
My life is over at 1 7.

983
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,793
Tulsi.

984
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,243
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the dance floor...

985
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:40,580
...for their very first couples dance,
Liz and Stephen.

986
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:54,969
My people.

987
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:56,971
-Are you ready?
-l'm ready.

988
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,434
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

989
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,936
I married a hottie.

990
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,358
-What is that? That's not our song.
-No, it is not.

991
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,110
Baby, that's not our song.

992
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:13,780
-Definitely not.
-Everybody's looking at us.

993
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,241
It's okay. I'm gonna go talk to the guy.
It's gonna be fine.

994
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:31,088
-l told you l'd get it.
-This is taking care of it?

995
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:33,150
I owe you a wedding gift.
I didn't know what was appropriate.

996
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,573
I wanted to tell you l've been...

997
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:41,075
...dedicating my Guru Gita to you.

998
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,873
Imagining you happy
is what got me through it.

999
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:52,044
What did it look like...

1000
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:54,380
...when I was happy?

1001
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:01,304
I imagine you and Rijul...

1002
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:04,473
...smiling and looking
at each other...

1003
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,852
...with love and kindness.

1004
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,397
It seemed very real.

1005
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,235
Thank you so much, Liz.

1006
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:20,197
That helps me to believe it as well.

1007
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,925
Thinking about your own wedding?

1008
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:41,427
Yeah, me too.

1009
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:45,431
The funny thing about weddings,
you end up thinking about yourself.

1010
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:51,228
Did you throw yourself a big shindig?
Big, white, floppy dress?

1011
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:57,610
Yep. l arranged it all.
Nobody forced me into anything.

1012
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,237
Yeah. And now
you can't forgive yourself.

1013
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:04,784
Honestly, I'm waiting for him
to forgive me.

1014
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:06,452
To release me.

1015
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,747
Waiting for him to forgive you
is a damn waste of time, Groceries.

1016
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:11,791
Forgive yourself.

1017
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,294
It's not that easy.

1018
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,130
Yeah.

1019
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:35,106
Good night, Richard.

1020
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,775
-Follow me.
-l'm tired.

1021
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,443
Get your butt up here.

1022
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,848
It's not a pretty story...

1023
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,976
...but it's pretty classic.

1024
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:18,149
Too much alcohol, too many drugs,
too much mindless cheating.

1025
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:21,819
Just regret.

1026
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,699
Ocean of regret.

1027
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:31,370
I lost everything.

1028
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:34,540
My pride, my job.

1029
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,209
My family.

1030
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,006
I lost my family.

1031
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:58,397
One day after work, l stopped off
at a bar and I got shitfaced.

1032
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:01,484
I was a lot like you, you know.

1033
01:28:01,651 --> 01:28:05,237
I was just-- I don't know.
I thought too much, I felt too....

1034
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,283
I wanted to feel nothing.

1035
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,205
I should've called a cab, but I didn't.

1036
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:17,625
I just got in my car
and l drove home.

1037
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:23,506
My little boy....

1038
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:31,555
He was 8 years old at the time.
He was pl--

1039
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:41,190
He was sitting in the driveway with his
little Hot Wheels, waiting for his lost...

1040
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,776
...drunk, miserable dad...

1041
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,738
...to come home and play with him.

1042
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,325
I didn't see him.

1043
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:57,623
I didn't. I just roared into that driveway
and l didn't see my little boy.

1044
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,710
But he-- No, he....

1045
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,256
He got out of the way.

1046
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,888
He was used to getting out of the way
when l was around.

1047
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:15,933
And l-- You know, I don't--

1048
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,893
I don't know.
I don't remember a thing.

1049
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:20,771
Next day, l woke up
and they were gone.

1050
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:27,319
My wife had been watching
what happened out the window.

1051
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:29,989
She just wasn't gonna....

1052
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:34,368
She just wasn't gonna
do it anymore.

1053
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,163
So....

1054
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,586
He's 1 8 now.

1055
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:47,381
He's in school and,
oh, God, he's so smart.

1056
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,639
God, he's so funny and he's....

1057
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:00,186
He's so sweet.

1058
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:08,444
I missed it all.

1059
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,487
I missed...

1060
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:15,784
...my son's growing up. Just missed it.

1061
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,549
Okay?

1062
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,720
Come here.

1063
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:43,729
Here's the deal.

1064
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,399
You're gonna stay here
till you forgive yourself.

1065
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,443
You hear me?

1066
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,447
Everything else
will take care of itself.

1067
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:57,576
Is this where you forgave yourself?

1068
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:03,582
I'm trying, Elizabeth.

1069
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,960
I am trying.

1070
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,218
Hey.

1071
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:02,808
I believe this is the song they were
supposed to play at our wedding.

1072
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:41,805
I did love you, Stephen.

1073
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,356
I know.

1074
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,319
But l still love you.

1075
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:06,789
So love me.

1076
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:14,546
But l miss you.

1077
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,302
So miss me.

1078
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:25,641
Send me love and light
every time you think of me...

1079
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:27,059
...then drop it.

1080
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,205
It won't last forever.

1081
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,000
Nothing does.

1082
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,397
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Richard.

1083
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,441
I'll see you.

1084
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:19,778
Now that you're going,
who is gonna kick my ass every day?

1085
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:23,782
Oh, l'd stay till a monsoon
swept me away if I could. Bye-bye.

1086
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,201
But you've got bills to pay
and houses to build.

1087
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:29,455
You just keep doing the work
and move on with your life, will you?

1088
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:32,291
The man is getting on a plane
and you're still bossing me.

1089
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:37,921
I've got your whole list: move on,
use mosquito repellent and....

1090
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:41,258
I don't know. There were some
other things. I wrote them down.

1091
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,599
Go back to Texas, Richard.

1092
01:34:57,567 --> 01:35:00,486
Well, l ain't getting
any prettier standing here.

1093
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:04,114
So l'm off.

1094
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,126
Hey, Groceries.

1095
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:17,836
Believe in love again.

1096
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,196
Liz. Liz, l've just taken
my badge off today.

1097
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:47,366
I've done so well.
Four weeks of silence. lt was so dull.

1098
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,910
But it's like a facelift
because your face...

1099
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:54,790
...you know, just relaxes and your
throat just drops down. It's a bargain.

1100
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,542
We've got so much to catch up on.

1101
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:05,342
Oh, golly. Good for you.
You will get so much out of that.

1102
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:09,346
And your throat will look amazing
as well.

1103
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,518
Excuse me, Elizabeth.

1104
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,563
They're asking you to report
to the seva office after dinner...

1105
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,064
...if you don't mind.

1106
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:22,067
We're taking you off
the floor-scrubbing team.

1107
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:25,737
There are about 50 devotees arriving
tomorrow from all over the world...

1108
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:29,408
...for a 1 0-day retreat and we'd
like you to be the key hostess.

1109
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:33,078
We ask that you don't take part
during the meditations.

1110
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:38,083
We need you to watch over the flock,
make sure everyone is all right.

1111
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:42,379
We call the person who does
this job Little Suzy Cream Cheese.

1112
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:47,092
You need to be social and bubbly
and smiling all the time.

1113
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:52,431
Madam...

1114
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,933
...l'm your girl.

1115
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:12,951
So just find your suitcase,
it should be here somewhere...

1116
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,329
...and then head down the path
to your room.

1117
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:21,835
So the holy truth of the whole
adventure here in India is in one line:

1118
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:25,714
God dwells within you as you.

1119
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:28,133
God's not interested
in watching a performance...

1120
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,636
...of how a spiritual person
looks and behaves.

1121
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:33,722
The quiet girl who glides silently
through the place...

1122
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,726
...with a gentle, ethereal smile,
who is that person?

1123
01:37:37,894 --> 01:37:42,147
That's lngrid Bergman
in The Bells of St. Mary's, not me.

1124
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:46,652
God dwells within me as me.

1125
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,223
Child tormented by demon.

1126
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:06,982
It looks like teething.

1127
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,067
Same thing.

1128
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,072
Your turn.

1129
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:21,246
Hello, Ketut.

1130
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:23,540
I'm very happy to meet you.

1131
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,585
You are a world traveler.

1132
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,921
No, I came to see you
about a year ago.

1133
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:33,925
-You girl from California?
-No, I girl from New York.

1134
01:39:35,094 --> 01:39:36,428
Don't remember.

1135
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,434
Well, you told me
I should come back here to Bali.

1136
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:44,728
You said I could help you
with your English...

1137
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:47,272
...and you would teach me
the things that you know.

1138
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,611
You gave me this.

1139
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,280
Okay.

1140
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,789
You. You. l remember you.

1141
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:06,124
-Oh, good.
-You sad girl from New York.

1142
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,919
-Yes.
-You Liss. You came back.

1143
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:11,129
-l came back.
-You, you, you.

1144
01:40:11,297 --> 01:40:12,422
Me, me, me.

1145
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,633
So long ago we meet.

1146
01:40:14,801 --> 01:40:19,971
Last time, you have too much worry,
too much sorrow.

1147
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:23,099
Last time,
you look like sad old woman.

1148
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:26,895
Now you pretty.

1149
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,564
-Why so different?
-Well...

1150
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,983
...a lot of things, really.

1151
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,986
But l was in Rome for four months,
just feeding myself...

1152
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:37,614
...and then I went to live
at an ashram in lndia.

1153
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,158
Now, we put together.

1154
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:41,827
Exactly. That's why l'm here.

1155
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:44,329
-Ketut good for that.
-What'd you give him?

1156
01:40:47,834 --> 01:40:50,335
Do you still want me to help you
with your English?

1157
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:52,629
English later, Liss.

1158
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:56,007
First, better idea.

1159
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:02,514
How old are these?

1160
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:05,350
From grandfather.
Very important spells.

1161
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:08,019
Also mantras, cures.

1162
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,438
Thousand years' worth.

1163
01:41:10,606 --> 01:41:14,150
All I have, all l know, right here.

1164
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:15,485
You copy for me?

1165
01:41:15,653 --> 01:41:17,696
Absolutely. l can go to town
and take these--

1166
01:41:17,864 --> 01:41:19,698
No. You don't take.

1167
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,370
You copy here, better, Liss.

1168
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:28,081
I take a nap now. l very old.

1169
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:31,543
How old are you, Ketut?

1170
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,336
One hundred and one...

1171
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:36,715
...or maybe 64.

1172
01:41:36,883 --> 01:41:39,217
Don't remember.

1173
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,394
This is gonna take me
the rest of my life.

1174
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:53,231
He make you pretty, find you husband,
you work hard for him.

1175
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,525
That's exactly opposite
of why l'm here.

1176
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:58,111
Everybody need husband.

1177
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,744
Would you mind getting me water?

1178
01:42:05,912 --> 01:42:07,412
No.

1179
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:12,250
Fine. Keep making copies.
I get water.

1180
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:29,434
So, Liz, the Balinese believe
that Bali's the center of the universe.

1181
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:31,269
And here we are
in the center of Bali.

1182
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:33,772
You got the one bedroom,
got your fish pond.

1183
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,649
You got your own meditation temple.

1184
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:38,568
I tell you, since the bombing,
tourism's been way down...

1185
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:42,197
...so l can give you this place
at a very, very good price right now.

1186
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:44,282
Paradise.

1187
01:42:47,036 --> 01:42:49,245
-l'll take it.
-People in Bali understand...

1188
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:52,457
...in order to stay happy,
must always know where you are...

1189
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,125
...every moment.

1190
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:58,922
Right here is perfect balance.
Right at meeting of heaven and earth.

1191
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:02,884
Not too much God,
not too much selfish.

1192
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:06,137
Otherwise, life too crazy.

1193
01:43:06,305 --> 01:43:09,766
You lose balance, you lose power.

1194
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:13,311
In morning,
you do meditation from India.

1195
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,814
Serious. Very serious.

1196
01:43:15,982 --> 01:43:18,108
In day, you enjoy Bali.

1197
01:43:27,994 --> 01:43:30,996
Then in afternoon, come see me.

1198
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:40,964
End of day, you do new meditation.

1199
01:43:41,132 --> 01:43:42,173
Very simple.

1200
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:46,011
Sit in silence and smile.

1201
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:48,638
I feel balanced already.

1202
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:50,181
Not so easy, Liss.

1203
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:55,020
Smile with face. Smile with mind.

1204
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:58,231
Even smile in liver.

1205
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:02,527
See you later, alligator.

1206
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:17,060
Oh, God.

1207
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,437
-Are you all right?
-Are you blind?

1208
01:45:19,605 --> 01:45:24,442
-Please, let me take you to a doctor.
-l'm fine. l just--

1209
01:45:28,114 --> 01:45:29,781
It looks bad.

1210
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:31,616
Very bad, Liss.

1211
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:34,953
-What happen?
-This idiot ran me off the road.

1212
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,955
A man? He rich?

1213
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:39,749
This very hot.

1214
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:43,294
-You need healer.
-l have you. You're a medicine man.

1215
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:47,090
-No. You need Wayan.
-Yeah.

1216
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,645
Jamu. Drink this.
Better than antibiotic.

1217
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,945
She make you drink this?

1218
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:11,156
-My name's Liz. What's yours?
-Tutti.

1219
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,491
Nice to meet you, Tutti.

1220
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:16,494
-Are you married?
-No.

1221
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:24,377
You sure? Not even once?

1222
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:26,754
Okay, well,
there was this one time...

1223
01:46:26,922 --> 01:46:30,800
...but l find when l tell people in Bali
that I'm divorced, it upsets them.

1224
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:33,178
Me too, divorce.

1225
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:37,515
Divorce make you sad
and make you an outcast.

1226
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:42,520
You have no sex
for a long time, baby.

1227
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:44,189
I can tell by your knee.

1228
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:48,359
The cartilage very dry.
Hormones from sex lubricate joint.

1229
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:50,320
-Okay.
-l pray for you.

1230
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:53,114
We sisters.

1231
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:55,992
Armenia!

1232
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:00,038
Armenia from Brazil.

1233
01:47:00,206 --> 01:47:01,998
Armenia, this is Liz from New York.

1234
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:04,375
-Hi.
-Lovely to meet you, Liz.

1235
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:06,294
Time for a banana root
hair treatment?

1236
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:09,547
-Yes, of course.
-lt makes the hair long and lustrous.

1237
01:47:09,715 --> 01:47:13,885
Like Cher circa 1 975.

1238
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,679
Do you have a nice dress?

1239
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,056
One.

1240
01:47:18,224 --> 01:47:20,225
Put it on tonight,
come to the Beach Shack.

1241
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:23,311
I'll introduce you to everyone.
The expats, the locals.

1242
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:25,396
You'll dance. You will love it.

1243
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:28,191
Oh, no, l don't think I can dance
with my leg like this.

1244
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:31,027
Of course you can. Leg no problem.

1245
01:47:31,403 --> 01:47:33,196
You see.

1246
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,949
Now you have to come.

1247
01:48:28,627 --> 01:48:32,255
Hi. Could I get a tequila on the rocks
with a lot of lime, please?

1248
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:34,132
Coming right up.

1249
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:41,264
Can l buy you a drink?

1250
01:48:41,432 --> 01:48:42,974
No, thank you, I'm fine.

1251
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:45,143
I-- l almost killed you.

1252
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:48,313
I am sorry for that, really.

1253
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:51,649
-Hello.
-Hi.

1254
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:54,068
I'm sorry, really.

1255
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:57,655
Yeah.

1256
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,835
I'm sorry I'm laughing,
but it's amazing.

1257
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:14,672
I was actually listening to this song
in the car when the tape jumped.

1258
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,176
And l leaned over to fix it
and l ran you off the road.

1259
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:23,139
-Did you tell them to play it?
-No, no, no. I make them mixtapes.

1260
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:24,432
Mostly Brazilian music.

1261
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,853
But l'm also very much into
Phil Collins and Air Supply.

1262
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:33,191
You really shouldn't
say things like that out loud.

1263
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:36,778
Liz!

1264
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:41,157
-Hi.
-Oh, I see you've already met Felipe.

1265
01:49:42,868 --> 01:49:47,205
Oh, of course. Two sad divorces.
You have so much in common.

1266
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:53,378
I have the perfect man for you.

1267
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:57,382
Just a little love affair.
Everyone has a little love affair in Bali.

1268
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,594
Isn't he charming? lan.

1269
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:03,721
Doesn't he look like Sting?

1270
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:06,391
Oh, yeah.
I made a very good mixtape of Sting.

1271
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:14,857
You should dance with him.

1272
01:51:00,863 --> 01:51:02,405
Got you. Come on, l got you.

1273
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:04,949
That's gonna hurt tomorrow.

1274
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:07,618
All right. You know what?

1275
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:12,415
-That is it. We are going swimming.
-No, I don't even have my-- l--

1276
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:15,585
You don't have your-- You don't--

1277
01:51:16,753 --> 01:51:17,962
You're so naked.

1278
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:20,965
Yeah, l'm naked.

1279
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,759
Armenia says everyone
should have a love affair.

1280
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:27,388
This is Bali. Everyone should have
a love affair in Bali.

1281
01:51:27,556 --> 01:51:28,973
Yeah, but--

1282
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:31,142
Oh, God. No, no, no.

1283
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:33,686
-Love affairs are awesome, dude.
-They are. l just--

1284
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,480
I dated you 1 5 years ago.

1285
01:51:35,689 --> 01:51:39,775
And l dated you six months ago.

1286
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:41,819
So l'm gonna go.

1287
01:51:41,987 --> 01:51:43,988
You're not-- You're really--
You're going.

1288
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:45,990
But you're cute.

1289
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,328
I think I look good.

1290
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:54,373
Wait a minute.

1291
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,125
Oh, sorry. Here.

1292
01:51:58,003 --> 01:51:59,670
-Thank you.
-Do you need a ride?

1293
01:52:01,089 --> 01:52:03,007
That way I won't run you over again.

1294
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,936
Hello.

1295
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:17,939
-What time is it?
-Five a.m.

1296
01:52:18,482 --> 01:52:21,025
Oh, you party hard.

1297
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:22,860
You really do.

1298
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:26,197
Thank you for....

1299
01:52:26,365 --> 01:52:27,365
-The ride?
-Yeah.

1300
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:29,867
You're very welcome.
Need help with the bicycle?

1301
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:31,202
You keep it.

1302
01:52:31,370 --> 01:52:33,371
Keep it? But it has a basket.

1303
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:36,249
It also has a bell.

1304
01:52:56,144 --> 01:52:58,354
Good afternoon. How are you?

1305
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,564
What are you doing here?

1306
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:03,734
Well, l've brought you
Wayan's famous hangover cure...

1307
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:07,029
...because you drank
a little bit too much last night.

1308
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:11,242
And here it is.
Very delicious, as you can see...

1309
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,743
...and very tasty.

1310
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:15,413
Do you make it a habit of
walking into people's houses?

1311
01:53:15,581 --> 01:53:18,541
Do you make it a habit of
sleeping with your front door open?

1312
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:25,047
It's a call. Moment.

1313
01:53:26,592 --> 01:53:29,760
-Hello, darling. How are you?
-Can't get the coffee machine to work.

1314
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:32,263
Okay. l've told you 50 times.
It's very easy.

1315
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:34,432
You change the filter,
you add the coffee...

1316
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,727
...you add water and that's it.
How did you get into college?

1317
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:40,771
-How do l make it like you?
-Listen, l've been making coffee...

1318
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:44,942
...darling, for 40 years, so you have
to be patient with yourself. All right?

1319
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:48,613
Okay. So, what's up with you?

1320
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:52,074
-Nothing. l just can't talk right now.
-Holy shit. You're with a girl.

1321
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:54,118
-l have to go.
-Who is she? ls she hot?

1322
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:56,120
-Jesus, she's hot.
-Dad, if you hang up...

1323
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,581
...l'll call back and embarrass you.

1324
01:53:58,749 --> 01:53:59,915
Dad, don't--

1325
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,462
That's a lot of "darlings," darling.

1326
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:06,130
Yeah. That darling was my son.

1327
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:09,634
I've called all my children "darling"
since they were little.

1328
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:12,803
Then there was a moment that
between the pets and the children...

1329
01:54:12,971 --> 01:54:15,640
...l was confused,
so l called everybody "darling."

1330
01:54:15,891 --> 01:54:17,391
Okay, you need to rest.

1331
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:20,061
Here is my number and my address.

1332
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:24,482
I'm gonna leave it here on the table,
in case you need a tour guide.

1333
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,651
A tour guide.

1334
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:31,072
And please, drink that up, because
it's gonna help you a big deal.

1335
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:33,366
Because you really look....

1336
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:37,495
-Ravishing?
-Astonishing.

1337
01:54:37,663 --> 01:54:40,331
-Go away. Please.
-Okay. Drink it up.

1338
01:54:40,499 --> 01:54:41,666
It's gonna be helpful.

1339
01:54:49,257 --> 01:54:50,633
Hey, Mr. Tour Guide.

1340
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:53,344
Can we start with a coffee?

1341
01:54:56,765 --> 01:54:58,182
Okay.

1342
01:54:58,392 --> 01:54:59,850
What are these?

1343
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:01,852
These are rambutan.
They're delicious.

1344
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:05,606
It's like an orange made love
to a plum. Would you like some?

1345
01:55:05,774 --> 01:55:08,526
When you put it that way,
yes, thank you.

1346
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:11,028
Excuse me.

1347
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,531
What is that?

1348
01:55:14,616 --> 01:55:16,492
No, no, no.

1349
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,369
They taste like dirty feet.

1350
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:19,829
-Really?
-Dirty feet.

1351
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,539
They taste like feet.

1352
01:55:21,707 --> 01:55:24,875
Look out. Nice.
How many places have you visited?

1353
01:55:25,043 --> 01:55:29,213
I have 46 stamps on my passport.

1354
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:33,509
I happen to have 49 stamps
on my passport.

1355
01:55:33,677 --> 01:55:35,720
-Forty-nine? I knew it.
-Yes.

1356
01:55:35,929 --> 01:55:37,430
-Knew what?
-l knew it.

1357
01:55:38,807 --> 01:55:41,183
We are both antevasins, my dear.

1358
01:55:41,351 --> 01:55:42,393
What is that?

1359
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,729
Antevasin is....

1360
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:47,815
It's an in-between.

1361
01:55:47,983 --> 01:55:50,067
It is the one who lives
by the border...

1362
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:53,654
...because they renounce
to the comfort of family life...

1363
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:56,824
...in order to seek "enlightment."

1364
01:55:56,992 --> 01:55:58,909
I like your word.

1365
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,203
And l like the way
you say "enlightment."

1366
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:02,747
"Enlightment." I try.

1367
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:06,208
You're missing a syllable,
but I like it.

1368
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,586
It's beautiful, no?

1369
01:56:08,754 --> 01:56:12,256
It's Pura Melanting,
which means "Temple of Prosperity."

1370
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:14,759
-Beautiful.
-Yup.

1371
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,928
-So next attraction of the tour?
-Yes.

1372
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:20,014
-Food from Bali.
-Oh, good. l'm starving.

1373
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:22,600
-Where should we go?
-To the best restaurant in town.

1374
01:56:22,768 --> 01:56:25,102
-Of course.
-My place.

1375
01:56:27,522 --> 01:56:28,898
Subtle.

1376
01:56:29,775 --> 01:56:32,276
Did you always live in Brazil
before you came to Bali?

1377
01:56:32,486 --> 01:56:33,778
No, no. Only for 20 years.

1378
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:38,199
Then l met my wife
and l moved with her to Australia.

1379
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:41,410
She traveled a lot
because of the job.

1380
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:45,122
-And I stayed home with the children.
-A good feminist husband.

1381
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:48,793
Yeah. Yeah. Didn't turn out to be
what she wanted, l'm afraid.

1382
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,461
-What happened?
-What happened?

1383
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:51,962
Well, the children were grown.

1384
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:57,802
And l run an import-export jewelry
business, so I could live anywhere.

1385
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:02,807
And Bali seemed like the perfect place
to recover from a divorce.

1386
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,937
And here l am. Here l am.

1387
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:09,772
-And you?
-Well, far less tragic.

1388
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:15,486
We were immature and really too
young to get married. We grew apart.

1389
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,154
Hearts were broken.

1390
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:19,657
Yes.

1391
01:57:19,825 --> 01:57:21,909
Then it's the same.

1392
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,958
This is just perfect.

1393
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:31,418
So are you.

1394
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:34,463
You know what you are?
You're a falsa magra.

1395
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,507
-You know what that is?
-What?

1396
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:40,177
You are slender and elegant
in a distance...

1397
01:57:40,345 --> 01:57:43,848
...but up close,
you are round and fleshy.

1398
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:47,560
Thank God for Brazilians.

1399
01:57:51,481 --> 01:57:53,357
Stop that!

1400
01:57:59,614 --> 01:58:01,699
You are a world traveler.

1401
01:58:01,867 --> 01:58:03,200
He says that to everyone.

1402
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,494
Already make your money.

1403
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:09,331
You don't have young-man ambition.

1404
01:58:10,166 --> 01:58:14,503
-He's good.
-You have three children.

1405
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:16,881
Two. That's a callous.

1406
01:58:19,509 --> 01:58:20,843
And you have divorce.

1407
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:23,345
Very difficult.

1408
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:26,515
You loved her very much.

1409
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:29,101
You haven't healed that wound.

1410
01:58:29,895 --> 01:58:34,106
Now you are scared
to open your heart.

1411
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:38,402
You are afraid
hurt will happen to you again.

1412
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,030
Only way to heal...

1413
01:58:41,197 --> 01:58:43,741
...is to trust.

1414
01:58:45,619 --> 01:58:49,872
This okay. To have broken heart
mean you have tried for something.

1415
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:57,087
Is it going to be broken again?

1416
01:58:57,255 --> 01:58:59,423
He a good man, Liz.
You need a good man.

1417
01:59:01,927 --> 01:59:03,594
Thank you.

1418
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:06,347
True. Ketut knows.

1419
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,562
I am so sick of people telling me
I need a man.

1420
01:59:13,730 --> 01:59:17,775
You don't need a man, Liz.
You need a champion.

1421
01:59:23,782 --> 01:59:27,117
-Some spring break, huh?
-Come on. You're moving like turtles.

1422
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:28,953
His enthusiasm is exhausting.

1423
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,455
Try being dropped off at school
when you're 1 0...

1424
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,791
...and having your father
kiss you on the mouth.

1425
01:59:33,959 --> 01:59:35,542
He still does it.

1426
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:39,421
I'm sure it's all normal in Brazil,
but I didn't grow up in Brazil.

1427
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:41,382
Friends would tease
the crap out of me.

1428
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,050
Why didn't you ask him to stop?

1429
01:59:43,218 --> 01:59:45,678
No, I did at first,
but then l realized...

1430
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:48,639
...how happy it made the old guy
and l just gave in.

1431
01:59:48,807 --> 01:59:53,602
You know what? My grandmother
hikes faster than you both...

1432
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:56,230
...but she's already dead.

1433
01:59:56,398 --> 01:59:59,149
Get him. Go get him.

1434
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:02,486
How about you carry the packs
for a while, eh?

1435
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:05,280
Come here. Look at this.

1436
02:00:05,657 --> 02:00:07,574
Is it nice?

1437
02:00:08,118 --> 02:00:09,159
Baby.

1438
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:12,246
Bringing up the rear.

1439
02:00:22,007 --> 02:00:24,758
-So have you slept with her yet?
-What was that?

1440
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:26,301
Have you slept with her yet?

1441
02:00:26,469 --> 02:00:28,178
Crossing the line.

1442
02:00:28,346 --> 02:00:32,141
Dad, it's been 1 0 years. lt's time.

1443
02:00:44,612 --> 02:00:46,989
Stay away from
all the beautiful girls.

1444
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:49,533
They are dangerous.

1445
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:56,123
-A week is too short.
-Yeah.

1446
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:59,209
-A week is too short.
-Yup.

1447
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:03,172
Listen, l've made you a mixtape.

1448
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:06,383
And l give you a present. For you.

1449
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:09,762
Thank you.

1450
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:12,723
I'm missing you already.

1451
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,316
Bye, Liz.

1452
02:01:24,569 --> 02:01:27,029
-Be safe.
-Same to you.

1453
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:31,075
So don't I get a kiss?

1454
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:33,077
I don't know.

1455
02:01:35,538 --> 02:01:38,165
-l love you, Dad.
-l love you too.

1456
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:55,099
So stupid, I know.

1457
02:01:55,683 --> 02:02:00,604
He's 1 9 years old
and he's such a man.

1458
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:04,233
It's sweet.

1459
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:06,443
You're sweet.

1460
02:03:40,705 --> 02:03:42,497
Darling...

1461
02:03:42,665 --> 02:03:44,541
...it's time.

1462
02:04:37,512 --> 02:04:38,553
-Liz.
-What?

1463
02:04:38,721 --> 02:04:42,099
Liz. Come here.
I have to tell you something.

1464
02:04:48,273 --> 02:04:50,941
No. I should really,
really be meditating.

1465
02:04:52,277 --> 02:04:54,403
Go, go. Do it.

1466
02:05:00,994 --> 02:05:03,412
You know, I have not been
to see Ketut in two weeks.

1467
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:04,621
-Really?
-Yes.

1468
02:05:04,789 --> 02:05:06,999
-Okay. Go, go.
-Okay.

1469
02:05:10,378 --> 02:05:14,298
Oh, gosh. But you are just
so much cuter than Ketut.

1470
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:21,305
No, I have to go. I have to go.

1471
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:30,272
Why?

1472
02:05:42,535 --> 02:05:44,953
You have bladder infection.

1473
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:49,666
Common after no sex,
then too much sexy time.

1474
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:53,420
We haven't even been apart
for a minute in two weeks.

1475
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:01,178
You're afraid now, right?

1476
02:06:01,346 --> 02:06:02,679
I understand.

1477
02:06:02,847 --> 02:06:04,973
You don't want to lose yourself.

1478
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:08,518
Love is scary, dangerous.

1479
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:10,187
Happen to me.

1480
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:15,192
I pray every day,
but husband bad for me.

1481
02:06:15,693 --> 02:06:17,569
I have to get away from him.

1482
02:06:18,863 --> 02:06:22,157
This from where he hit me...

1483
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:23,867
...with motorcycle helmet.

1484
02:06:24,869 --> 02:06:27,162
And then my daughter...

1485
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:30,165
...she begged me to leave him.

1486
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:31,875
Is that right, honey?

1487
02:06:32,085 --> 02:06:34,878
I said, "I think you should
get a divorce, Mommy."

1488
02:06:35,088 --> 02:06:38,673
She was 4 years old
when she said it.

1489
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:46,807
Don't feel bad about Felipe.

1490
02:06:46,974 --> 02:06:49,559
Everybody needs affection, honey.

1491
02:06:49,727 --> 02:06:51,728
Make people do funny things.

1492
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:55,232
Everyone gets like that
at beginning of relationship.

1493
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:59,027
Want too much happiness,
too much pleasure...

1494
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:02,197
...until make yourself sick.

1495
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:06,910
Even to Wayan, this happen
at beginning of my love affair.

1496
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,913
I lose myself, Liz.

1497
02:07:11,624 --> 02:07:13,208
Dear friends and loved ones:

1498
02:07:13,376 --> 02:07:15,085
My birthday's coming up soon.

1499
02:07:15,253 --> 02:07:17,754
If I were home, l'd be planning
a stupid, expensive...

1500
02:07:17,922 --> 02:07:21,883
...birthday party and you'd all be
buying me gifts and bottles of wine.

1501
02:07:22,051 --> 02:07:25,053
A cheaper, more lovely way
to celebrate would be to...

1502
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:27,973
...make a donation to help a healer
named Wayan Nuriyasih...

1503
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:30,267
...buy a house in Indonesia.

1504
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:33,603
She's a single mother.
ln Bali, after a divorce...

1505
02:07:33,771 --> 02:07:36,523
...a woman gets nothing,
not even her children.

1506
02:07:36,691 --> 02:07:40,735
To gain custody of her daughter, Tutti,
Wayan had to sell everything...

1507
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:43,447
...even her bath mat,
to pay for a lawyer.

1508
02:07:44,449 --> 02:07:46,450
For years,
they've moved from place to place.

1509
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:50,287
Each time, Wayan loses clientele
and Tutti has to change schools.

1510
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:55,125
This little group of people in Bali
have become my family.

1511
02:07:55,293 --> 02:07:58,795
And we must take care of our
families, wherever we find them.

1512
02:07:58,963 --> 02:08:02,299
Today l saw Tutti playing with
a blue tile she'd found in the road...

1513
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:05,135
...near a hotel construction site.
She told me:

1514
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:07,971
Maybe if we have
a house someday...

1515
02:08:08,181 --> 02:08:10,974
...it can have a pretty blue floor
like this.

1516
02:08:11,809 --> 02:08:13,602
When I was in Italy,
I learned a word--

1517
02:08:13,769 --> 02:08:15,020
It's "tutti" with double T.

1518
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:20,442
--which in ltalian means "everybody."
So that's the lesson, isn't it?

1519
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:23,153
When you set out in the world
to help yourself...

1520
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,614
...sometimes you end up
helping Tutti.

1521
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:32,162
-Tell me again.
-Eighteen thousand American dollars.

1522
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:34,998
I brought you the e-mails to look at.

1523
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:38,668
Oh, my God.

1524
02:08:38,836 --> 02:08:40,128
We get a house.

1525
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:43,507
It can be the house for everybody!

1526
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:48,845
I can have a pharmacy!
I can have a library!

1527
02:08:50,014 --> 02:08:52,682
-All right. Oh, God.
-Close them again. Close your eyes.

1528
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:55,185
Careful. You don't wanna
break a tooth or anything.

1529
02:08:55,353 --> 02:08:58,188
-Don't worry, but close your eyes.
-Where are you taking me?

1530
02:08:58,356 --> 02:08:59,356
You will see.

1531
02:08:59,524 --> 02:09:02,025
-You helped Wayan to get a house...
-l know.

1532
02:09:02,193 --> 02:09:03,693
...and we're going to celebrate.

1533
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:05,487
-Here, here, here.
-All right.

1534
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:08,156
-Turn, turn, turn.
-l know we're at the beach.

1535
02:09:08,324 --> 02:09:10,200
Here you go.

1536
02:09:11,369 --> 02:09:13,328
We're going to take a little boat trip.

1537
02:09:14,539 --> 02:09:15,539
Where?

1538
02:09:15,748 --> 02:09:18,708
Where? To a little island nearby.

1539
02:09:18,876 --> 02:09:22,379
It's my favorite place in the world.
I've packed for two.

1540
02:09:22,547 --> 02:09:27,384
We can stay there until next Tuesday.
And l have the perfect camping spot.

1541
02:09:27,885 --> 02:09:31,555
Just you and l and 400 parrots.

1542
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:36,518
Do you like it?

1543
02:09:38,563 --> 02:09:43,233
I was going to save it for tonight,
but I think this is the right moment.

1544
02:09:43,401 --> 02:09:46,194
I have to be in Bali
because my business is here...

1545
02:09:46,362 --> 02:09:48,071
...and you have to be in New York...

1546
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:50,907
...because that's
where your life is, right?

1547
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:55,370
What if we tried to create a life that
is divided between the two places?

1548
02:10:00,543 --> 02:10:02,294
Why would you wanna do that?

1549
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:04,921
Because I'm in love with you.

1550
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:12,804
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Oh, no. I....

1551
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:16,057
-What?
-l can't. l'm sorry.

1552
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:17,767
-l just....
-You can't?

1553
02:10:17,935 --> 02:10:19,436
-l'm sorry. I can't.
-Can't what?

1554
02:10:19,604 --> 02:10:24,441
I can't go on a trip right now,
okay? I....

1555
02:10:24,609 --> 02:10:28,445
I haven't been home in five days.
I haven't seen Ketut in weeks.

1556
02:10:28,613 --> 02:10:31,114
-lt's just too much.
-lt's not much.

1557
02:10:33,784 --> 02:10:35,452
To go...

1558
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:37,120
...by ourselves...

1559
02:10:37,288 --> 02:10:41,625
...apart from everything else for
a couple of days, is that much for you?

1560
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:44,878
Liz, não entendo.
What's the problem, Liz?

1561
02:10:45,046 --> 02:10:48,715
I mean, l have the same fears,
I have the same scars that you have...

1562
02:10:48,883 --> 02:10:50,925
...and l show them to you.

1563
02:10:51,093 --> 02:10:54,721
But l guess the only difference
between you and l is that...

1564
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:56,806
...you are afraid to love again.

1565
02:10:56,974 --> 02:10:58,350
My darling, this is it.

1566
02:10:58,726 --> 02:11:01,645
You have to look me in the eye
and let me know the truth.

1567
02:11:02,271 --> 02:11:06,107
Please. Do you love me
or do you love me not?

1568
02:11:10,154 --> 02:11:11,738
Look me in the eyes and tell me...

1569
02:11:11,906 --> 02:11:15,367
...do you love me or don't
you love me not? lt's very easy.

1570
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:18,495
I know you feel the same way.
Why can't you say it back?

1571
02:11:18,663 --> 02:11:20,747
I don't know why.

1572
02:11:22,792 --> 02:11:24,000
Why can't l?

1573
02:11:24,168 --> 02:11:27,504
Because you're terrified, my love.
But listen, it's fine. Me too.

1574
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:30,840
But l still want to get
into that boat with you.

1575
02:11:31,008 --> 02:11:33,510
-No. Okay, look. Look.
-What?

1576
02:11:33,678 --> 02:11:36,680
I don't know why
you can't understand this.

1577
02:11:36,889 --> 02:11:40,433
I found something
and l can't give it up.

1578
02:11:40,601 --> 02:11:44,854
And trust me, if I did,
you wouldn't be so all in love with me.

1579
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:48,525
Okay, the balance thing. You traveled
around the world to find your balance.

1580
02:11:48,693 --> 02:11:51,194
And the balance that you think
you've found is what?

1581
02:11:51,404 --> 02:11:55,323
Meditating for 20 minutes and
going to see an old medicine man?

1582
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:59,202
Listen, balance, my darling, balance
is not letting anybody love you...

1583
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:02,372
-...less than you love yourself.
-You know what? You know what?

1584
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:06,459
Do not tell me what lessons l have
and haven't learned in the last year...

1585
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:09,045
...and don't tell me how balanced
and wise you are...

1586
02:12:09,213 --> 02:12:11,548
...and how I can't express myself.

1587
02:12:11,716 --> 02:12:15,385
And do not say "darling" to me again
because l am just gonna lose it.

1588
02:12:15,553 --> 02:12:19,848
Listen to me! l do not need to love you
to prove that l love myself.

1589
02:12:26,814 --> 02:12:28,732
Run away from me?

1590
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:34,863
You are running away from all
the great possibilities of your own life.

1591
02:12:38,701 --> 02:12:41,077
I'm getting into that boat.

1592
02:14:08,332 --> 02:14:09,499
For you.

1593
02:14:09,667 --> 02:14:12,001
A goodbye gift.

1594
02:14:20,344 --> 02:14:21,845
Ketut.

1595
02:14:32,857 --> 02:14:34,691
Liss...

1596
02:14:35,067 --> 02:14:37,318
...you healed me.

1597
02:14:39,488 --> 02:14:41,990
You healed me too, Ketut.

1598
02:14:44,618 --> 02:14:47,620
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have come back to Bali...

1599
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:50,540
...and l wouldn't have come back
to myself.

1600
02:14:50,708 --> 02:14:53,001
You want coffee? Roast pig?

1601
02:14:54,461 --> 02:14:56,045
Coffee.

1602
02:14:56,213 --> 02:14:57,505
I get you coffee.

1603
02:14:57,673 --> 02:14:59,549
You fly back to America soon?

1604
02:14:59,717 --> 02:15:01,885
In two hours.

1605
02:15:02,052 --> 02:15:03,887
Have you ever been
on an airplane, Ketut?

1606
02:15:04,597 --> 02:15:07,390
Ketut cannot fly on aeroplane.

1607
02:15:08,726 --> 02:15:11,227
Ketut have no teeths.

1608
02:15:14,899 --> 02:15:18,067
You are good friend to me.

1609
02:15:18,235 --> 02:15:19,903
You are like daughter.

1610
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,156
When I die...

1611
02:15:23,324 --> 02:15:26,701
...you will come back to Bali?
Come to my cremation?

1612
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:30,121
Balinese cremation ceremony
is very fun.

1613
02:15:30,915 --> 02:15:32,916
-You will like it.
-Okay.

1614
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:39,380
You still smile with your liver,
like l tell you?

1615
02:15:39,548 --> 02:15:40,590
Yes.

1616
02:15:40,758 --> 02:15:44,761
You still meditate like your guru
in India teach you?

1617
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:47,138
-Yes.
-You happy now with God?

1618
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:52,060
-Yes.
-You love your new boyfriend?

1619
02:15:57,942 --> 02:15:59,859
I ended it.

1620
02:16:01,654 --> 02:16:03,905
Don't understand.
Why you do that?

1621
02:16:07,785 --> 02:16:10,787
I couldn't keep my balance.

1622
02:16:12,289 --> 02:16:16,376
Liss, listen to Ketut.

1623
02:16:16,543 --> 02:16:20,713
Sometimes to lose balance
for love...

1624
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:25,176
...is part of living balanced life.

1625
02:16:39,316 --> 02:16:41,150
In the end...

1626
02:16:41,318 --> 02:16:46,114
...I've come to believe in something
I call "The Physics of the Quest."

1627
02:16:48,158 --> 02:16:52,996
A force in nature governed by laws
as real as the laws of gravity.

1628
02:16:53,497 --> 02:16:57,000
The rule of Quest Physics
goes something like this:

1629
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:01,295
If you're brave enough to leave behind
everything familiar and comforting...

1630
02:17:01,463 --> 02:17:04,966
...which can be anything from your
house to bitter, old resentments...

1631
02:17:05,134 --> 02:17:07,677
...and set out
on a truth-seeking journey...

1632
02:17:07,845 --> 02:17:10,805
...either externally or internally...

1633
02:17:10,973 --> 02:17:13,516
...and if you are truly willing
to regard everything...

1634
02:17:13,684 --> 02:17:16,686
...that happens to you on that journey
as a clue...

1635
02:17:16,854 --> 02:17:21,357
...and if you accept everyone you
meet along the way as a teacher...

1636
02:17:25,863 --> 02:17:28,364
...and if you are prepared,
most of all...

1637
02:17:28,532 --> 02:17:32,869
...to face and forgive some
very difficult realities about yourself...

1638
02:17:33,037 --> 02:17:35,371
...then the truth
will not be withheld from you.

1639
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,790
Felipe?

1640
02:17:50,137 --> 02:17:52,388
I can't help but believe it,
given my experience.

1641
02:18:25,756 --> 02:18:28,299
I decided on my word.

1642
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:38,434
It means:

1643
02:18:40,270 --> 02:18:42,605
"Let's cross over."
