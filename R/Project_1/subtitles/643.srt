1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,346
Losing Diana was like
losing a part of me.

2
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,185
I thought nothing could change
the way we felt about each other.

3
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,230
I thought we were invincible.

4
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,610
Someone once said,
if you want something very badly,

5
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,570
set it free.

6
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,699
If it comes back to you,
it's yours forever.

7
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,120
If it doesn't,
it was never yours to begin with.

8
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,501
I knew one thing,
I was David's to begin with.

9
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,211
And he was mine.

10
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:15,926
You light up my life, you give...

11
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,553
We met in high school.

12
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,347
David was a senior
and I was a freshman.

13
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,974
On Wednesdays, after glee club,

14
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,144
he'd drive me and my best friend home
from school.

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,521
I used to watch him
in the rear view mirror.

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,357
I fell in love with his eyes.

17
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,868
When I was 19, David proposed to me
on the pier at Paradise Cove.

18
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,328
Our parents were against it.

19
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,416
They said we were too young
and we really didn't know each other.

20
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,587
But David said that
a life without risk is like no life at all.

21
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,006
So we eloped.

22
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:16,445
I graduated from architecture school
and got a job at a small firm.

23
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,157
Diana helped support us
by selling real estate.

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,120
I spent all of my free time
working on a design of my own.

25
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,872
It summed up everything
about architecture

26
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,124
that really mattered to me.

27
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,085
It was my dream house.

28
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,411
D.

29
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,958
Have I ever told you I love you?

30
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,044
No.

31
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,629
I do.

32
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,172
Still?

33
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,425
Always.

34
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,471
We had our differences.

35
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,057
He used to take his clothes off
and leave them on the floor.

36
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,809
It made me crazy.

37
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:54,126
What do you think this is, huh?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

38
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,545
-What is the problem here?
-I don't need to do your fucking laundry!

39
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,629
Honey, I'll pick it up.

40
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,590
-You don't have to get violent on me.
-What about this, huh?

41
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,633
-No, no. You put that down, honey.
-Peanut butter sandwich...

42
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,344
That is serious.
You're gonna hurt somebody with that.

43
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,762
I'm gonna hurt somebody, huh?

44
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,805
You're out of your mind.

45
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,891
Okay, now. Fine.

46
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,812
God damn it!

47
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,232
Come on, let's just relax.

48
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,276
Did I hurt you?

49
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,320
-No. I'm all right.
-I'm sorry.

50
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,988
-Really?
-Yeah.

51
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,531
You were kidding?

52
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,826
D, your pants are on fire.

53
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,121
You have no idea.

54
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,931
We never had much money,
so for entertainment

55
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,892
David would show me architecture
that moved him.

56
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,894
But sometimes I'd have to ask,

57
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,814
"Why are we looking
at a stupid car wash?"

58
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,234
And he would just say, "No, not stupid.

59
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,945
"Don't just use your eyes."

60
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,698
He made me look at things differently.

61
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,869
David, this is a steal.
It just came in to the office

62
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,662
and nobody even knows about it yet.

63
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,830
It's beautiful.

64
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,958
You could build a house here.
You'll have made a name for yourself,

65
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,710
because of course,
the house would be brilliant.

66
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,712
Because it would be
a David Murphy house.

67
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,175
I found an incredible piece of property
in Santa Monica by the ocean.

68
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,010
It was the perfect site for David's house.

69
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,094
How are we supposed to do it?

70
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,929
We'll borrow the money
like everybody else.

71
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,807
I'm telling you, these leverage
stock broker buyout guys,

72
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,267
you should see the junk they buy.
Are you kidding?

73
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,103
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

74
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,606
It was brilliant,

75
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,525
even though I didn't
understand a word of it.

76
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,819
We had to tighten our belts
for the loan payments,

77
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,198
but it was our future.
And I got to build my house.

78
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,913
And then the recession hit.

79
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:40,834
The real estate market dried up
and I hadn't closed a sale in six months.

80
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,338
Construction fell
to its lowest point in years.

81
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,633
People were being laid off everywhere.
And I was one of them.

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,468
I feel really bad about this.

83
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,970
I don't understand. What happened?

84
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,973
The bank has called in
the demand note.

85
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,642
Can they do that?

86
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:01,063
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

87
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,566
What assets?

88
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,737
Your house.

89
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,366
You got to keep up those payments.

90
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,035
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,092
David, I'm scared.

92
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,140
We don't have any money.

93
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,643
What are we gonna do?

94
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,775
I'll wait tables
or drive a cab or something.

95
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,288
Hey, I'll take care of you.

96
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,959
Make it go away.

97
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,054
I was desperate.
We stood to lose everything.

98
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,223
The house I'd been building,
even our own home.

99
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,436
I swallowed my pride
and borrowed $5,000 from my father.

100
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,646
It wasn't enough.

101
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,691
We needed $50,000.

102
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,331
-D. D, D.
-What?

103
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,999
-Get up, get dressed.
-What's the matter?

104
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,335
-I got an idea. Come on.
-What?

105
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,087
-What time is it?
-Chop chop.

106
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,823
Hi, how you doing? Okay.

107
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,450
Cigars. Cigarettes. Lighted yo-yos.

108
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,831
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, my God!

109
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,501
Oh, honey. That's the spirit!
Keep them coming.

110
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,713
$50,000, that's what we want.
We're winners!

111
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,849
Boom, skinny, skinny!
Put some money in the kitty.

112
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,060
Eleven. Winner.

113
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,563
We got a shooter now, folks.
We got a shooter.

114
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,273
A lucky, lucky lady shooter.

115
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,608
Keep it coming. Stack it, don't rack it!

116
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,365
If I haven't gotten nine,
Denzel Washington ain't fine.

117
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,035
Hard six! Hard six!

118
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,579
-All bets set, folks.
-Who's the one?

119
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,684
And I have a necklace...

120
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,689
Why don't you put it on?

121
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,191
It suits you.

122
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,404
Well, I can't afford it.

123
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,574
That's too bad.

124
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,534
Yep.

125
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,000
I really think
you ought to have the dress.

126
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,544
Let me buy it for you.

127
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,340
-You want to buy me this dress?
-Yeah.

128
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,927
-Why?
-I've enjoyed watching you.

129
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,097
You've earned it.

130
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,101
No, I haven't.

131
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,648
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

132
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,322
Boom, skinny, skinny!

133
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,159
Pull in that. Pull in that stack.

134
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,994
We got a new shooter, now.
Coming out.

135
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,746
Coming out to seven or eleven.

136
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,873
Roll them now, girlfriends.

137
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,333
Seven!

138
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,551
Come on now! Come on.

139
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,138
-I can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.
-Oh, my God!

140
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,932
I can't believe it!

141
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,981
-$9,000.
-My God, it's so great!

142
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,192
This is my wife D. These are my girls.

143
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,444
They're gonna be moving in. All right.

144
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,613
Come on. Kiss them.

145
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,201
Bets, please.

146
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,912
'Cause we're winners!

147
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,790
Boom, skinny, skinny!

148
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,341
Did I ever tell you I love you?

149
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,551
-No.
-I do.

150
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,177
-Still?
-Always.

151
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:11,910
Five thousand.
This little pile here, you guessed it.

152
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,746
Five more, D.

153
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,582
What do you think this is? Five more.

154
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,877
Play with it,
roll around with it, enjoy yourself.

155
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,587
Oh, my!

156
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,009
And the grand total is...

157
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,098
$25,040.

158
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,894
So, we're half-way there, like in an hour.

159
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:41,357
I figure about two hours tomorrow,

160
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,193
-we'll be home free.
-Come here.

161
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,044
What?

162
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,217
I love you.

163
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,681
I know that.

164
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,851
No, I mean, even without the money.

165
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,100
Let's split the three and the six for me.

166
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,357
-That's right. Why don't you split them?
-Fifteen.

167
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,487
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

168
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,119
Come on, black. Come on, black.
Here we go.

169
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,914
Yes!

170
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,383
Double zero.

171
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,219
No more bets, please.

172
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,058
Come on, black. Here we go.

173
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,103
Yes, we won!

174
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,465
$4,1 00, we said
we wouldn't go below $5,000.

175
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,718
Do you want any more coffee?

176
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,553
No, thank you.

177
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,156
Tails, we quit. Heads, we go for it.

178
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,469
Two out of three.

179
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,972
Last call for wagers.

180
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,184
No more bets.

181
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,437
Okay. I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

182
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,148
All of it. Red.

183
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,943
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

184
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,114
We can do this, huh? D?

185
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,701
I'm gonna put it all.

186
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,538
I'm putting it on red.

187
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,458
Okay.

188
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,148
-No, it's black! It's black.
-What are you doing?

189
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,609
-It's black.
-What are you doing?

190
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,116
No, no, it's red. It's red.

191
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,410
Go with your instincts. Right?

192
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,538
-No more bets.
-Oh, come on, man. Come on, red.

193
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,710
Got to get it. Got to get it.

194
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,171
Come on, red. Come on, red.

195
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,641
Too late, young lady.

196
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,515
Place your bets. Bank side, player side.

197
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,143
All set? Cards, please.

198
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,607
Turning for the players.

199
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,276
Passes to the right, please.

200
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,200
Player draws nothing.

201
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,752
And set.

202
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,756
Player side, banker side.

203
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,842
-Any other bets?
-Who's that guy?

204
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,594
That's John Gage.

205
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:30,182
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son-of-a-bitch, right there.

206
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,935
He's down over
a million dollars already.

207
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,688
You see those little gold things
he's playing with?

208
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,398
$1 0,000 a piece.

209
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,485
Every time he lays one down,
ten thousand big ones.

210
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,278
Look at him, how cool he is.

211
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,571
That son-of-a-bitch
must get more pussy

212
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,073
than you can shake a stick at.

213
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,866
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you or anything.

214
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,201
-Player wins.
-What are y'all doing here?

215
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,661
-You gambling?
-No.

216
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,579
It's about time.

217
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,664
Y'all married?

218
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,207
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

219
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,417
Stick around and gamble a little.

220
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,336
Excuse me. Excuse me.

221
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,882
Would you mind lending me your wife?

222
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,551
Is that your wife?

223
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,969
Excuse me?

224
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,222
For luck.

225
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,308
You'd have to ask her.

226
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,811
May I?

227
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,356
-Go for it.
-I don't think it's a good idea.

228
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,649
I think we should just go.

229
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,234
Just for a moment?

230
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,737
-I'll go.
-Go ahead. It might be fun.

231
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,822
What do we got to lose?

232
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,157
Well?

233
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,825
Why don't you go in
and see what happens?

234
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,326
Yeah. Go ahead.

235
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,829
We'll be right here backing you up.

236
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,581
Thank you.

237
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:39,126
See if you can get a little
of that money from him.

238
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,754
Do you think she'll ever come back?

239
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,007
I'm just bullshitting you.

240
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,552
Have a seat.

241
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,262
I've been losing all day long.

242
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,972
Then you appeared
and I won my first hand.

243
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,849
You brought me luck.

244
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,312
I'd say that's a sign. Wouldn't you?

245
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,860
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thank you.

246
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,362
Candy?

247
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,784
Place your bets.

248
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,869
-Bank side, player side.
-$1 00,000.

249
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,537
Any other bets?

250
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,124
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

251
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,584
All bets set.

252
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,003
$20 tie-in.

253
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,341
Not like that.

254
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,468
Sorry.

255
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,224
All bets set. Cards, please.

256
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,147
-Turning for the players.
-Now, what we want...

257
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,151
What we need is a nine.

258
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,536
We don't like that.

259
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,747
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

260
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:02,084
Bank's a winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

261
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,340
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

262
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,092
Do you like cards?

263
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,594
Not especially.

264
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,847
Wish I'd asked you sooner.

265
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,056
Dice?

266
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,809
Yeah, I guess.

267
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,564
Sam.

268
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,649
Mr. G?

269
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,153
One.

270
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,488
Excuse me, Mr. G.

271
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,042
Well, maybe I should go.

272
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,251
This shouldn't take too long.
Here we go.

273
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:46,253
-What?
-This.

274
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,137
Now,

275
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,183
I hope you find this interesting.

276
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,477
Pit. Tadross.

277
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:05,314
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it's here now.

278
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,358
Yes, sir.

279
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,489
I understand.

280
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,909
Yes, sir. Thank you.

281
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,744
Goes for $1 million.

282
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,245
It's a bet.

283
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,627
Here you are, Mr. G, $1 million.

284
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,823
Bet it all.

285
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,889
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven.
This time it is a come out roll.

286
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,017
Hone those skills now. Get them down.

287
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,393
Pick two.

288
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,028
Now, just throw a seven.

289
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:38,032
If you want to throw an eleven,
that's all right, too.

290
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,789
Aren't you forgetting something?

291
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:07,186
Seven!

292
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,615
The winner is seven. Everyone.

293
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,078
Think I ought to quit now?

294
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,205
I think I should.

295
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,084
Credit my account.

296
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,711
Excuse me. Excuse me.

297
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,881
Sweetie, it was amazing.
Incredible. Oh, my God.

298
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,383
Unbelievable.

299
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,843
Hi. John Gage.

300
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,471
-Oh, hi. David Murphy.
-Hi, David.

301
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,308
Congratulations. This is my wife, Diana.
I guess you met.

302
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,560
-Hi, Diana? Hi.
-Diana.

303
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,480
Thank you, both.

304
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,941
Very generous of you, David.
Are you staying at the hotel?

305
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,776
Oh, no. Actually, we were just leaving.

306
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,236
-You're leaving?
-Yes, we're on our way out.

307
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,655
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.
We got to celebrate.

308
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,949
Let me arrange a room for you here.

309
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,743
-That's very nice, but...
-No, I... I insist.

310
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,746
Please. It's the least I can do. Okay?

311
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,791
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

312
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,878
There's some lovely shops off the lobby.
Have you seen them?

313
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,258
Let's go.

314
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,604
How about that?

315
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:37,693
Wow.

316
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:42,614
Hey, D, what do you think? Godfather?

317
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,206
You won a million dollars today.

318
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,500
He won it.

319
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,669
Honey, you won it for him.

320
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,137
This feels nice.

321
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,475
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

322
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:10,934
-Okay.
-Okay.

323
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,613
Hello. William Shackleford.

324
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,323
Hi. David Murphy.

325
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,203
For Mrs. Murphy, from John Gage.

326
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,499
-Well, thank him for us.
-I'll do that.

327
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:37,044
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight
in his suite at 9:00.

328
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,671
If you could find the time
in your schedule,

329
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,589
he'd be most pleased.

330
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:45,469
-Look what you got.
-What?

331
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,138
A gift from Gage.

332
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,100
Really?

333
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,103
Well, open it up.

334
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,241
That's $5,000.

335
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,494
How do you know that?

336
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:14,123
I... I saw it in the store downstairs.

337
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:19,962
-Lucky for him you like black.
-Yeah.

338
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:57,559
No past, no future, you just check into
a hotel and start all over again.

339
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:03,107
I'd stick them under the sheets...

340
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:06,276
That's strange, am I right?

341
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:30,551
Who is that guy, Shackleford?

342
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:35,639
Someone who works for me.
Someone I trust.

343
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,104
He killed someone once.

344
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:50,612
Tell me, where do you see yourself
in, say, ten years?

345
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,827
Well, I wouldn't mind
being a billionaire like yourself.

346
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,872
No... Nice shot. I mean, beyond money.

347
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:03,667
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well at night?

348
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,712
What, are you saying
you're not satisfied?

349
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,047
Who is?

350
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,424
I am.

351
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,179
She mean it?

352
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:17,931
I hope so.

353
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,893
Well, then,
you may not have won in Vegas,

354
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:21,977
but you're a lucky man.

355
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:25,522
'Cause I got money. I got security.
I have businesses,

356
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,025
but you have something
that I just don't have.

357
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,403
Well, I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

358
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,447
Not many.

359
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:37,284
Well, some things aren't for sale.

360
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:39,703
Such as?

361
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,040
Well, you can't buy people.

362
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,461
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

363
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,754
Well, in business, maybe,

364
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,548
but not when real emotions
are involved.

365
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:53,384
So, what are you saying?
You can't buy love?

366
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:56,345
That's a bit of a cliché, don't you think?

367
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,514
It's absolutely true.

368
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,891
Is it? What do you think?

369
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,186
-I agree with Diana.
-You do?

370
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,816
Well, let's test the cliché.

371
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:18,117
Suppose I were to offer you $1 million

372
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,414
for one night with your wife.

373
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,130
I'd assume you're kidding.

374
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:35,300
Let's pretend I'm not.
What would you say?

375
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,140
He'd tell you to go to hell.

376
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,601
I didn't hear him.

377
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:48,188
I'd tell you to go to hell.

378
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,204
That's a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical.

379
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,666
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

380
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,504
I'm not kidding. A million dollars.

381
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:17,676
Now, the night would come and go,
but the money could last a lifetime.

382
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,680
Think of it. A million dollars.

383
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:27,936
A lifetime of security, for one night.

384
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:33,317
And don't answer right away.
But consider it.

385
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:36,278
Seriously.

386
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,782
We're positive, okay?

387
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:46,080
Well, then,
you've answered my question.

388
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:50,417
And you've proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

389
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,505
It's late, and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

390
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:56,965
May I have one dance?

391
00:36:57,717 --> 00:37:00,094
Of course, with your permission.

392
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,680
You know something,
I think you better get on to that meeting.

393
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:05,891
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

394
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,436
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her, either.

395
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,357
Good night.

396
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,957
Can't sleep?

397
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,003
No.

398
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,715
Me, neither.

399
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:28,640
I just keep thinking about it.

400
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,771
It's so weird, isn't it?

401
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:37,608
Yeah.

402
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,700
David, I think you want me to do it.

403
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:56,001
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous.

404
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,006
Well, maybe we should
just talk about it.

405
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,467
Well, I don't want you to do it.

406
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,101
-But you'd let me do it.
-No.

407
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,275
Why, do you want to do it?

408
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:23,821
No.

409
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,283
But I would.

410
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,453
I'd do it for you.

411
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,082
For me?

412
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:48,303
I can't believe
we're even talking about this.

413
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,641
Think about what this money
could do for us.

414
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:55,102
What it could do for our future.

415
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:02,693
You could finish your house.
You could pay your dad back.

416
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:05,529
Get rid of our debt.

417
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:09,992
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

418
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,289
It's just my body.
It's not my mind. It's not my heart.

419
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:21,754
You think we could
do something like that?

420
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:32,306
Look, we both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

421
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,515
Yeah.

422
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:37,770
So we'd just have to look at it like that.

423
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,234
I slept with Bubba Aruzio,
for God's sake.

424
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,778
If I can sleep with Bubba,
I can sleep with anybody.

425
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,654
You slept with Bubba?

426
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,282
-Come on, you knew.
-No, I didn't know that.

427
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,659
When did you sleep with Bubba?

428
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:57,122
When you were off
sleeping with that slut Olivia Daigle.

429
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:01,168
-Olivia Deagle. She wasn't a slut.
-Oh, excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

430
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,421
I'm telling you. She wasn't a slut.

431
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:08,092
-Yes, she was.
-No, she wasn't.

432
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,135
Unfortunately.

433
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:16,517
Thank God we can laugh about it.

434
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,478
Yeah.

435
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:22,106
That's easy to say now. But after...

436
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:30,447
We'd just have to
forget it ever happened.

437
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:36,286
And never discuss it. Not even once.

438
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:42,960
I mean, because nothing
would have happened.

439
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:47,381
Nothing that matters, anyway.

440
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,393
We have a brilliant script,
really, very special.

441
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,437
-Major.
-It's a vehicle,

442
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,398
-a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.
-Billy Ray Cyrus.

443
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:07,192
-It's kind ofA Star is Born.
-So...

444
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,361
Your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

445
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,904
-Should have been two.
-Yeah, except our lawyer,

446
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,364
son-of-a-bitch, caved in on us.

447
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:13,574
-That won't happen again.
-No.

448
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:16,076
See, we're gonna get a lawyer
that's tough, a lawyer that's savvy...

449
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:19,371
Someone who would
step on his grandmother for us.

450
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:22,583
Mr. Green, a David Murphy
would like to speak to you.

451
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,251
He says it's urgent.

452
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:25,919
Put him on the speaker.

453
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,881
This is an old college buddy of mine.
It'll only take a second.

454
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:30,382
-Jeremy?
-Davey.

455
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,176
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
What's up?

456
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,678
Well, listen,
we need you to close a deal.

457
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:37,639
-What kind of deal?
-A big deal, a very big deal.

458
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,308
Big deal. Go on.

459
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:42,019
We're in Vegas, at the Hilton.

460
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:44,688
We met John Gage.
You know who he is?

461
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:46,732
Sure, I know who he is.
He's a billionaire,

462
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:48,859
and a major poon hound.

463
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:51,528
He is?

464
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:52,946
Go on.

465
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,324
He offered us a million dollars.

466
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:58,911
A million dollars?
For what? Your kidneys?

467
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,748
For one night with Diana.

468
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:09,755
What do you mean? One night, like...

469
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,923
Yes.

470
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,679
Could you excuse me for a second?

471
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,436
Let me get this straight.

472
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:27,564
He offered you a million dollars
for a night with your wife?

473
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:29,566
As in your wife, Diana?

474
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,777
And you agreed to it?

475
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:35,280
I don't know what to say, man.
How could you do something like that?

476
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,282
How could you negotiate without me?

477
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,119
Never negotiate
without your lawyer! Never!

478
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:44,331
For a woman like Diana,
I could have got you at least two million!

479
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:47,960
Obviously! You don't want
to get screwed, and then screwed.

480
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:50,796
Hey, stay. Please.
This is damage control.

481
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,006
Two seconds. Eat cookies.

482
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,549
-There's cookies coming.
-No. You don't understand.

483
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:54,967
-We've heard enough.
-You're hired.

484
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,760
You are. You're our man.
We love your style.

485
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:57,845
-Great.
-Thank you.

486
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,471
Gladys, check
the gentlemen's schedules.

487
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,306
And call me next week.
Wednesday? Wednesday good?

488
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,933
-Great. Okay.
-See you then.

489
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,184
-Thanks for coming.
-No, thank you.

490
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,353
-No, thank you.
-Thank you.

491
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,441
Okay, David,
before we go any further, let's...

492
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:13,944
Let's get the moral issue out of the way.

493
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,155
-Leave that to us.
-No, I was referring to my fee.

494
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,990
I get five percent.

495
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,828
Do you want to elaborate
on the verification clause?

496
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:24,538
Verification...

497
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:28,500
That means you pay even if
the relationship isn't consummated.

498
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,253
You mean if I'm impotent.

499
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,924
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

500
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:39,678
I can live with that.
The John Garfield clause?

501
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:42,139
That's if you die in the act.

502
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,730
I have no problem with that, either.
Can I have your pen?

503
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:59,823
-You're pretty good, you know?
-Thank you.

504
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:02,368
You should come work for me.

505
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,297
We have a deal.

506
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:24,306
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

507
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:36,610
So...

508
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,115
You can go.

509
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,410
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

510
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:47,705
to take leave of one another.

511
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:17,693
It's all right. I don't bite.

512
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,239
So...

513
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,410
What, should I go undress?

514
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,709
You know, cheer up.
You got to find a more creative way

515
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:34,793
to think about this, okay?

516
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:36,628
Just look at it like an episode
of The Dating Game

517
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:39,631
that went a little bit, you know,
awry or something like that.

518
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:42,301
Ladies and gentlemen,

519
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:46,722
we wish to welcome you
to ourjamboree.

520
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:50,809
...I couldn't believe it.
I know we could've gotten two million.

521
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:52,895
Here's your Buddha.

522
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:55,898
Davey, no point
getting out the crying towel.

523
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:59,360
You got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks.

524
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,824
She's an amazing woman. She really is.

525
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,868
Couldn't have gotten $500
for my girlfriend.

526
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:09,912
Not that I'd do that.

527
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,623
But it's okay that you did.

528
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:15,376
This is a different situation
and she agreed to it.

529
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,044
You got to remember that.

530
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:19,546
And it's not like it's hard duty
or anything like that.

531
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:21,590
Hell, he's a great looking guy.

532
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:24,677
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

533
00:47:25,929 --> 00:47:27,262
Maybe not.

534
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,307
Hey, buddy!

535
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:43,862
Come on!

536
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:56,125
Come on. Come on.

537
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,421
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

538
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:16,145
D? It's me.

539
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:21,483
D! D!

540
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,321
Where is she? Where's my wife?

541
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:30,034
Where is she?

542
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:34,788
Diana!

543
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,207
Please!

544
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,917
Where did she go?
What happened to her?

545
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:40,753
-Where'd they go?
-Up. Up.

546
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:42,838
-Up! Up where?
-Up.

547
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:44,631
Helicopter.

548
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:09,531
D!

549
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:14,411
D! D!

550
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,626
D!

551
00:53:38,134 --> 00:53:41,637
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

552
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,027
Come here.

553
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,635
You missed a button.

554
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:30,894
Thank you.

555
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:35,315
I want to show you something.

556
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,083
What happened?

557
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,502
The lights went out.

558
00:54:58,256 --> 00:55:00,215
I see that. Why?

559
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:05,554
Look.

560
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:13,729
Can you turn those off, too?

561
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:19,234
I'm working on it.

562
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:26,867
Who made the decision?

563
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,040
-We both did.
-No.

564
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,586
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

565
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:40,631
You don't know him.

566
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:42,758
I know he didn't stop you.

567
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:45,594
If you were mine,

568
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:51,266
I wouldn't share you with anyone.

569
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,650
You have no right to judge David.

570
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,322
You're the one who has to buy women.

571
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,991
You think I have to buy women?

572
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,373
Why me, then?

573
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:17,835
I bought you because you said
you couldn't be bought.

574
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:21,213
I can't be bought.

575
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:24,633
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

576
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:28,012
You might enjoy it.

577
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:31,098
Don't bet on it.

578
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,687
I think I will.

579
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:43,444
Heads, we do.

580
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,446
Tails, we call the whole thing off,

581
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:48,657
turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

582
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:50,951
What do you say?

583
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,663
It's your party.

584
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,542
It's my lucky dollar.

585
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,503
So I can't lose.

586
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:24,985
Trust me.

587
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,490
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

588
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,668
-I love you.
-I love you.

589
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:04,019
I told myself it was over.

590
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:06,939
Like a dream
that vanishes in the morning light.

591
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:10,651
And in time, enough time,
I would forget.

592
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:27,042
Yeah.

593
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,421
All right.

594
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:34,466
Yeah.

595
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,927
Yeah, a little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire.

596
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,679
It's nothing. Yeah.

597
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,558
Look, I've got people here.

598
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,601
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

599
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:47,479
Sorry, I'm here for you now.

600
01:00:48,189 --> 01:00:51,734
-All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...
-Alta Vista.

601
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:54,778
Vista. It's right here. Murphy property.

602
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:57,156
Yeah. We've been a little late
on the payments.

603
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,033
We want to settle up.

604
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:02,953
-I don't think that's possible.
-What do you mean?

605
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:05,330
Well, the mortgage
is two months in default.

606
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:09,585
And it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

607
01:01:11,212 --> 01:01:14,423
-To another party? Who?
-That's privileged information.

608
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:17,343
How can that be?
We called specifically for an extension.

609
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:20,137
The extension expired two days ago.

610
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:23,432
You don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

611
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:26,226
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

612
01:01:26,853 --> 01:01:29,313
Under the terms of this agreement,
they don't have to give us a warning.

613
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:32,483
But in fact, an attempt was made
to call you on the third,

614
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:34,860
and a registered letter
return receipt requested,

615
01:01:34,944 --> 01:01:36,362
was attempted on the fourth.

616
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:38,447
Apparently, there was no one home.

617
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:40,240
-We were out of town.
-We were out of town.

618
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:44,536
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

619
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,457
You snooze, you lose.

620
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:52,461
-"You snooze, you lose"?
-It's an expression.

621
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:54,672
You snooze, you lose.
Oh, that's beautiful.

622
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:57,383
You snooze, you lose. That's bullshit!

623
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:01,679
-This is bullshit, man.
-David...

624
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:03,347
Hey, don't deal with these people.

625
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:06,308
They sold us out,
they'll sell you out, too.

626
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,024
Hey, want to help me in the garden?

627
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:57,860
Okay.

628
01:03:07,328 --> 01:03:10,372
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

629
01:03:12,959 --> 01:03:14,168
David?

630
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:19,048
What's Gryphon?

631
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,051
Gryphon.

632
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:26,263
Where did you hear that name?

633
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,558
You have a box of matches.

634
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:34,480
We said we wouldn't talk about it.

635
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,358
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

636
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:41,945
-Don't you?
-No.

637
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:49,203
D, I thought I could forget about this,
but I can't.

638
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:56,168
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

639
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:05,052
Gryphon is a boat.

640
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:09,848
He took you to a boat? In Nevada?

641
01:04:10,308 --> 01:04:13,310
-We flew to Santa Barbara.
-What kind of boat?

642
01:04:13,436 --> 01:04:15,604
-A big boat.
-And then what?

643
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,898
And then nothing.

644
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:24,029
Where did you get the matches?
Have you been going through my bag?

645
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:25,155
No.

646
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:30,744
Why? What's in your bag?

647
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:34,623
I'm not gonna talk about this.
I'm not gonna do it.

648
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:12,888
What?

649
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,517
Who you talking to?

650
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,894
My mother.

651
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:22,189
And what did Mom have to say?

652
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:26,402
Nothing. She wasn't there.

653
01:06:26,903 --> 01:06:28,404
I thought you said
you were just talking to her.

654
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:30,906
How could you be talking to her
if she wasn't there?

655
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:34,618
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

656
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:37,663
-She wasn't in after 1 0:00?
-No. She's not.

657
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:40,833
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

658
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,839
What is the matter with you?

659
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:55,597
-What is that?
-You know what it is.

660
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:02,604
-Where did you get this?
-In your wallet.

661
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,356
Well, I've never seen it before.

662
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,692
Well, it was right there
in the old secret compartment.

663
01:07:06,776 --> 01:07:07,776
David, I don't even use that.

664
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,445
-Have you been seeing him?
-No, I haven't.

665
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:11,113
You can't stop thinking about him,
can you?

666
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:14,033
-You won't let me.
-Can you, D?

667
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,784
What are you doing
going through my wallet, anyway?

668
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:16,994
-I don't trust you.
-Well, you know what?

669
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:18,203
I don't trust you, either.

670
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:20,205
Well, then we're even.

671
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,592
I had to do something.

672
01:07:31,676 --> 01:07:34,720
I wanted to make something good
out of all we'd done wrong.

673
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:37,431
I decided to try and buy our land back.

674
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:40,684
Okay, Alta Vista...

675
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:45,356
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I want to make him an offer.

676
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,900
I'll get killed for this, Diana.

677
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:50,069
I don't want you to get in trouble.
I really appreciate it.

678
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:53,364
-543, Alta Vista...
-Wait, there it is. There it is right there.

679
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:54,907
-Okay. Okay.
-Back up.

680
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:58,160
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

681
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:02,748
Oh, my God, look at this.
This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

682
01:08:02,832 --> 01:08:05,751
He's one of the...
I just saw this guy on TV.

683
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:24,687
I'm not going back in there.

684
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:49,211
You bastard! You stole our property!

685
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:53,132
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce
a friend of mine...

686
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,967
I'm not your friend.

687
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,052
Diana advised me on a piece of property
in Santa Monica.

688
01:08:57,137 --> 01:08:59,930
That's bullshit. You're a liar.
You took it, and I want it back.

689
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:02,057
I tell you what, can we have a...
Excuse me. That's okay.

690
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:03,642
No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

691
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,269
Very well, sir.

692
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,355
Excuse me.

693
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:17,740
I'm taking it off.

694
01:09:21,202 --> 01:09:22,494
Wait a minute.

695
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:23,954
Why? What, did you
just want to hurt me?

696
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:25,581
Nonsense. I think you're wonderful.

697
01:09:25,665 --> 01:09:27,291
That was our house.
How could you do that?

698
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:30,377
-I got there first.
-I want you to sell it back to me.

699
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:33,255
-You can't afford it.
-Well, how's a million dollars?

700
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,174
The price is two.

701
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:37,301
Oh, and if I had two,
the price would be four, right?

702
01:09:37,385 --> 01:09:39,595
Listen, I saw an opportunity and I took it.

703
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,055
You had the money,
you had the right instincts,

704
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:43,557
but you were too late. That's all.

705
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:46,352
-I want you to work for me.
-You go to hell.

706
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:49,021
-Listen, I mean it.
-Never.

707
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:50,314
Why not?

708
01:09:50,982 --> 01:09:53,525
-Because I hate you.
-No, you don't.

709
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,737
You wish you hated me.

710
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:18,842
Hi, D.

711
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:24,890
You look awful.

712
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:29,645
-Where you been?
-I'll tell you about it.

713
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:32,606
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

714
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:37,111
Do you want some?

715
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:02,344
So, where you been?

716
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:12,187
Last night I stayed up for hours
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

717
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,191
And today?

718
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,864
And today I saw Gage.

719
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:33,625
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

720
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:36,420
-Did you fuck him?
-No.

721
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:37,796
But you wanted to, right?

722
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:40,549
David, I met him in broad daylight,
surrounded by a bunch of rich assholes.

723
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:42,092
I don't believe you.

724
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:44,720
David, he bought our property, okay?

725
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:46,930
That's why I went to see him.

726
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:50,017
I just wanted to find some way
to get it back.

727
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:54,355
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

728
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:56,648
D, you gotta tell me
what happened on that boat.

729
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:59,485
-David, don't do this. Don't do this!
-Tell me what happened on that boat.

730
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,779
-Why?
-Because I want to know.

731
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:05,699
All right, I'll tell you. You know what?
The man was a fucking stallion, David.

732
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,701
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night long.

733
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:09,828
-Does that do it for you?
-Is that the truth?

734
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:11,747
The truth?
You don't want the fucking truth.

735
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:13,707
You want me to lie.
You want me to say he's awful.

736
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,209
So, you know what?
I'm gonna tell you he's awful

737
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:16,627
and you won't believe me.
How can I win?

738
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,754
Just tell me the truth, D.

739
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,632
It was sex, David. Just sex.

740
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:23,425
Not love. Just sex.

741
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,178
-And was it good sex?
-Don't do this, David.

742
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:28,263
Can you just tell me that, D?
Was it good?

743
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:29,848
What are you hesitating for?
Just tell me.

744
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,768
Was it good? Was it good?
Was it good?

745
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:34,770
Yes.

746
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,116
David.

747
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:54,331
D, don't you tell me it was just sex

748
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,208
because you were attracted to him
all along.

749
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:58,293
You know that's bullshit.

750
01:12:58,461 --> 01:12:59,795
David, I did it for you.

751
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:01,588
Don't you tell me you did it for me.

752
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:03,632
-You did it for yourself.
-That's not... That's a lie.

753
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:05,426
-You were dying to do it.
-That's a lie.

754
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:08,345
I would never do this for myself.
It was all for you.

755
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:11,724
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

756
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,662
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

757
01:14:15,747 --> 01:14:21,001
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price, right?

758
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:23,045
Thanks, Jeremy.

759
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:25,214
Coming from the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

760
01:14:25,298 --> 01:14:26,674
that's very comforting.

761
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:33,389
Green. Oh, hi, Di.

762
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:35,808
I'm not here.

763
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:39,353
Yeah, he's right here.
You want to speak to him?

764
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:42,690
-No, I don't want to talk to him.
-Look, sweetie,

765
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:48,570
he loves you, you love him.
I mean, you got to try and work this out.

766
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,239
It's all pretty simple, right?

767
01:14:50,323 --> 01:14:52,199
This is a deal even I can't screw up.

768
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:57,579
Tell him he can keep the money.
I don't want any of it.

769
01:15:07,048 --> 01:15:10,384
Davey, she said
she doesn't want the money.

770
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:14,221
Well, I don't want the money, either.

771
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:26,775
I'll take it. I mean, nobody else wants it.

772
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,633
-Hey.
-Hi, Diana.

773
01:16:06,691 --> 01:16:09,902
The next few weeks without David
felt like months.

774
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,530
I got very good at staring at walls.

775
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:19,495
Diana. Diana. The recession has ended.

776
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:23,749
There's a fellow out there,
he wants to see $1 0 million homes.

777
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:25,501
There is a God.

778
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:31,715
Find someone else.

779
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:35,636
Find someone else? Are you nuts?

780
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,680
Do you know what the commission is
on $1 0 million?

781
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:40,057
-I can't do it.
-You have to do it.

782
01:16:40,141 --> 01:16:42,226
You're the best one I have.

783
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:46,021
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

784
01:16:52,153 --> 01:16:53,445
I'm sorry, Mr. Langford, I can't.

785
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:59,034
Diana, I would never dream of forcing
you to do anything against your will.

786
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:02,663
Except this one time.

787
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,334
Now, move your ass or you're fired.

788
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:16,969
If you think this is going to work,
you underestimate me.

789
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:44,371
You are truly beautiful.

790
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,751
What do you think you're doing?

791
01:17:50,754 --> 01:17:52,504
Looking for a house.

792
01:17:57,135 --> 01:18:00,346
Well, there's Bel Air, Holmby Hills,
Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.

793
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:03,182
-Where would you like to go first?
-Paris.

794
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,603
1120 Bel-Air Road, please.

795
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,281
The ceilings are French Gothic.

796
01:18:19,366 --> 01:18:21,700
Renaissance paintings as you can see.

797
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:23,869
Parquet floors throughout.

798
01:18:23,953 --> 01:18:26,205
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

799
01:18:26,289 --> 01:18:28,248
This is the master bath.

800
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:35,631
Why didn't you return any of my calls?

801
01:18:36,299 --> 01:18:39,968
-Do you like it?
-No.

802
01:18:53,024 --> 01:18:54,733
-$30 million minimum.
-You think?

803
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:57,069
-I know.
-Well, let's look at it.

804
01:18:57,237 --> 01:19:00,114
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.

805
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:33,188
This is your house, isn't it?

806
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:37,609
Do you like it?

807
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:45,367
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

808
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:51,165
What do you think it needs?
Tell me. Honestly.

809
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:56,587
I think it needs a life.

810
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:03,302
I think it needs furniture, and maybe
a couple of dogs and flowers.

811
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:04,970
It needs you.

812
01:20:08,808 --> 01:20:12,019
Just forget it. It just won't work.

813
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:13,562
Why not?

814
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:18,859
Because from where we started,
we've got nowhere to go.

815
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:20,736
You don't know that.

816
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:24,782
I never started this way either.

817
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:29,244
I need you.

818
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,708
No.

819
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:37,378
You collect things.

820
01:20:40,715 --> 01:20:42,091
Don't you?

821
01:20:44,094 --> 01:20:45,427
Sometimes.

822
01:20:51,768 --> 01:20:52,893
Yeah.

823
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:02,671
Even if you were extremely rich,
and extremely smart,

824
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:05,132
-can you be President?
-No.

825
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,217
-You couldn't be President?
-No.

826
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:08,510
Why not?

827
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:13,098
I took a second job teaching citizenship
just to keep myself busy.

828
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:20,230
-Ju, where were you born?
-I was born in Seoul, Korea.

829
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:22,066
Okay, where was she born?

830
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:25,944
-She was born in Seoul, Korea.
-She was born in Seoul, Korea.

831
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:28,822
Now, Ju, do you have
any children born here?

832
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,538
Where were you born, Miguel?

833
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:39,792
Sorry.

834
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,878
Welcome back. Where were you born?

835
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:45,214
-Cuba.
-Cuba.

836
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:48,258
So, how do we say Cuba in America?

837
01:22:49,052 --> 01:22:52,346
Cue-ba. Hi.

838
01:22:54,265 --> 01:22:57,434
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't this a citizenship class?

839
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:59,269
-Yes.
-Can I sit in?

840
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:02,272
It's full.

841
01:23:04,275 --> 01:23:05,401
Okay.

842
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:12,533
Cuba.

843
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:14,243
Cuba. Thank you.

844
01:23:29,884 --> 01:23:33,012
Okay. I have a question for you.

845
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:37,766
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

846
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:41,311
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

847
01:23:45,316 --> 01:23:48,861
And... And beautiful.

848
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,530
And talented.

849
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:55,659
And I am crazy about her.

850
01:24:05,253 --> 01:24:07,588
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

851
01:24:07,672 --> 01:24:09,506
I'm trying like hell.

852
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:12,843
-I think maybe you should go.
-You want me to go?

853
01:24:12,927 --> 01:24:14,136
-No.
-No.

854
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:19,850
Nice people.

855
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:24,605
-They want the dream.
-Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

856
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:31,028
You have chalk on your face.

857
01:24:34,574 --> 01:24:37,159
I have something I want to show you.

858
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,134
I didn't know whether you liked big ones
or little ones.

859
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,682
You're so beautiful. Come here.

860
01:25:02,936 --> 01:25:05,854
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

861
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:11,026
But it's a start.

862
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,874
Dance?

863
01:25:29,004 --> 01:25:30,379
I should go.

864
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:37,803
I remember once when I was young

865
01:25:37,887 --> 01:25:40,848
and I was coming back from someplace,
a movie or something,

866
01:25:40,932 --> 01:25:42,725
I was on the subway.

867
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:49,356
There was a girl sitting across from me,
and she was wearing this dress

868
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:53,777
that was buttoned clear up right to here.

869
01:25:57,907 --> 01:26:01,076
She was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

870
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,998
And I was shy then.

871
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:10,336
So when she would look at me,
I would look away.

872
01:26:13,089 --> 01:26:16,091
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

873
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:17,926
she would look away.

874
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:24,933
Then I got to where I was gonna get off
and I got off, the doors closed,

875
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:30,356
and as the train was pulling away,

876
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:35,444
she looked right at me
and gave me the most incredible smile.

877
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:40,908
It was awful.

878
01:26:41,951 --> 01:26:43,535
I wanted to tear the doors open.

879
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:48,207
I went back every night, same time,
for two weeks.

880
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:53,671
But she never showed up.

881
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:58,258
That was 30 years ago

882
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:04,556
and I don't think that there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

883
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:08,811
I don't want that to happen again.

884
01:27:15,902 --> 01:27:17,444
Just one dance?

885
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:54,411
I want a word with you, Gage.

886
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:58,457
See, what you don't know is,
we got a secret, me and Diana.

887
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:00,209
We're invincible.

888
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,087
Diana, I need to talk to you.

889
01:31:03,171 --> 01:31:05,297
Maybe tomorrow
would be a better time to talk.

890
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:07,675
Well, maybe tomorrow
would be a better time, you think...

891
01:31:07,759 --> 01:31:09,843
Hey, Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

892
01:31:09,928 --> 01:31:11,178
You know that emblem you got,

893
01:31:11,262 --> 01:31:14,890
the Gryphon, the eagle,

894
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,225
yeah, I don't think it's a good idea.

895
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:17,643
I got a better idea.

896
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:19,311
Shall I...

897
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:21,021
How about the cuckoo?

898
01:31:21,106 --> 01:31:24,400
You know, because, it's...
I'm talking to you for a second...

899
01:31:24,734 --> 01:31:27,820
The cuckoo is an interesting bird
because it doesn't have its own nest,

900
01:31:27,904 --> 01:31:31,782
so it moves into the nest
of other birds and it destroys their eggs.

901
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:33,617
David, stop. Just...

902
01:31:36,579 --> 01:31:38,622
You don't love me anymore?

903
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:47,172
Have I ever...
Have I ever told you I love you?

904
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:53,137
Have a nice dinner.

905
01:31:55,432 --> 01:31:56,682
Help him.

906
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:00,477
Go inside.

907
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:36,717
You've done a lot since USC.

908
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:43,223
First in your class, the AIA award,
Prix de Rome.

909
01:34:44,642 --> 01:34:45,768
Yeah.

910
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:49,313
Why would you want this job?

911
01:34:50,106 --> 01:34:51,899
Well, I want to work.

912
01:34:56,863 --> 01:34:58,447
Over-qualified.

913
01:34:59,157 --> 01:35:00,783
Fine. Exploit me.

914
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:40,406
Great architecture is only gonna
come from your passion.

915
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:42,991
And even that won't assure you a job.

916
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:47,746
Louis Kahn, died in a men's room
in Penn Station.

917
01:35:47,831 --> 01:35:49,873
For days, no one claimed the body.

918
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,792
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

919
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:54,003
The money men did not weep.

920
01:35:54,504 --> 01:35:57,214
Because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

921
01:35:57,298 --> 01:35:58,632
They're a pain in the ass,

922
01:35:58,717 --> 01:36:02,094
because they know
that if they do theirjobs properly,

923
01:36:02,178 --> 01:36:04,763
if they just this once get it right,

924
01:36:04,848 --> 01:36:09,184
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

925
01:36:14,816 --> 01:36:17,026
-What is this?
-A brick.

926
01:36:18,903 --> 01:36:22,114
-Good. What else?
-Aweapon.

927
01:36:26,536 --> 01:36:30,205
Louis Kahn said even a brick
wants to be something.

928
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:41,133
A brick wants to be something.

929
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:45,387
It aspires.

930
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:57,191
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

931
01:37:02,906 --> 01:37:05,783
It wants to be something better
than it is.

932
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:16,710
And that is what we must be.

933
01:37:20,548 --> 01:37:22,257
See you on Friday.

934
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:37,523
A brick wants to be something, huh?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

935
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:40,275
-What are you doing here?
-I missed you.

936
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:43,070
-I missed you, too.
-Thanks.

937
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:52,287
-How you doing?
-I'm good. Getting it together.

938
01:37:58,962 --> 01:38:00,713
She wants a divorce.

939
01:38:03,883 --> 01:38:04,883
She wants her freedom,

940
01:38:04,968 --> 01:38:10,931
and if you don't contest it,
you get everything.

941
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:14,601
The land, the money, everything.

942
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:17,521
Where is she?

943
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,443
Hi, everybody.

944
01:38:26,322 --> 01:38:29,783
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.

945
01:38:30,035 --> 01:38:31,952
You may wonder
what you're doing here,

946
01:38:32,037 --> 01:38:36,081
sitting in the blazing sun
as the smell of the zoo

947
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:37,750
wafts past your nostrils.

948
01:38:37,834 --> 01:38:41,003
The reason you're here
is because you are loaded.

949
01:38:41,504 --> 01:38:44,256
May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people

950
01:38:44,341 --> 01:38:47,593
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.

951
01:38:47,677 --> 01:38:51,263
Every year we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.

952
01:38:51,348 --> 01:38:52,514
We auction animals.

953
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:54,767
We bid as high as we possibly can,

954
01:38:54,851 --> 01:38:57,269
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.

955
01:38:57,354 --> 01:38:59,229
Let's start the show with a bang.

956
01:38:59,314 --> 01:39:02,107
We've got a superstar
as our first animal.

957
01:39:02,192 --> 01:39:05,361
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

958
01:39:05,528 --> 01:39:09,198
The animal itself is far too big
and angry to bring along.

959
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:10,824
Look at this guy.

960
01:39:10,909 --> 01:39:16,163
Thousands and thousands of pounds
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

961
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:19,291
Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.

962
01:39:19,376 --> 01:39:22,169
And look at that magnificent beastie.

963
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:26,590
To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money...

964
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:29,134
Thank you very much.

965
01:39:29,678 --> 01:39:32,054
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

966
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:34,765
Isn't that nice?

967
01:39:38,061 --> 01:39:39,478
Ladies and gentlemen,
I couldn't even dream

968
01:39:39,562 --> 01:39:43,023
of starting the bid below $10,000.

969
01:39:43,108 --> 01:39:45,484
-Now, I know that's a lot of money...
-Thirty.

970
01:39:45,568 --> 01:39:49,905
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen.

971
01:39:50,615 --> 01:39:54,952
Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?

972
01:39:55,578 --> 01:39:58,414
-Thirty five.
-$35,000.

973
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:01,000
-Forty.
-$40,000. Ladies and gentlemen.

974
01:40:01,084 --> 01:40:03,502
-45,000.
-45,000.

975
01:40:03,586 --> 01:40:07,047
-Fifty.
-$50,000.

976
01:40:07,757 --> 01:40:10,009
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.

977
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:15,014
$50,000 once, $50,000 twice,
ladies and gentlemen...

978
01:40:15,473 --> 01:40:16,890
$1 million.

979
01:40:24,232 --> 01:40:27,317
-I'm sorry?
-$1 million.

980
01:40:30,655 --> 01:40:33,198
Did you say $1 million, sir?

981
01:40:34,075 --> 01:40:35,075
Yeah.

982
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:38,287
Ladies and gentlemen, $1 million.

983
01:40:39,914 --> 01:40:43,792
Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?

984
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,336
I didn't think so.

985
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:48,714
In that case, sir, I believe
you're the proud owner of a hippo.

986
01:40:48,798 --> 01:40:50,466
Congratulations.

987
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:05,898
Hello, Diana.

988
01:41:06,024 --> 01:41:09,068
Ladies and gentlemen, the next animal
to take the stand is an ostrich.

989
01:41:09,152 --> 01:41:11,737
I really wanted you to have that money.

990
01:41:11,821 --> 01:41:14,656
And I really wanted you
to have that hippo.

991
01:41:15,116 --> 01:41:17,409
But we love them in Scotland...

992
01:41:17,827 --> 01:41:20,579
Maybe you two
would like a moment alone.

993
01:41:25,752 --> 01:41:28,754
So, can we hear a bid
of, maybe, a million?

994
01:41:32,634 --> 01:41:34,843
-45,000.
-$45,000.

995
01:41:34,928 --> 01:41:36,053
So...

996
01:41:39,557 --> 01:41:40,766
-How are you?
-I hear you...

997
01:41:40,850 --> 01:41:42,101
-Sorry, go ahead.
-...are teaching. Go ahead.

998
01:41:42,185 --> 01:41:43,894
-I'm sorry.
-Go ahead.

999
01:41:44,396 --> 01:41:46,063
Yeah. I'm teaching.

1000
01:41:49,192 --> 01:41:50,609
You know, it doesn't pay much,

1001
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:53,696
but at least I get to talk
about architecture.

1002
01:41:54,155 --> 01:41:56,615
You know how I love to talk
about architecture.

1003
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,367
Oh, my goodness.

1004
01:41:59,244 --> 01:42:01,662
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a little shower.

1005
01:42:01,746 --> 01:42:06,000
Please, ladies...
A check book makes an ideal umbrella.

1006
01:42:06,209 --> 01:42:09,294
Do we have a dolphin?
We have dolphins.

1007
01:42:09,379 --> 01:42:11,588
How about tropical fish?

1008
01:42:11,673 --> 01:42:14,800
I know, you're running home
for more cash. I get it.

1009
01:42:14,884 --> 01:42:18,137
Come on, ladies and gentlemen,
you can find the money.

1010
01:42:18,221 --> 01:42:20,347
Oh, to hell. I'm gone.

1011
01:42:30,275 --> 01:42:32,651
Listen, I have to talk to you
about what happened, D.

1012
01:42:32,736 --> 01:42:35,404
-Don't. Don't.
-No, no, no. I have to.

1013
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:37,156
Just hear me out.

1014
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:43,162
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

1015
01:42:43,913 --> 01:42:46,874
was thinking that I could forget
what we did.

1016
01:42:49,502 --> 01:42:51,754
I thought we were invincible.

1017
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:57,134
But now I know that the things
that people in love do to each other,

1018
01:42:57,218 --> 01:42:58,719
they remember.

1019
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:03,057
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

1020
01:43:03,141 --> 01:43:05,184
it's because they forgive.

1021
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:13,525
I was just...

1022
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:19,865
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.

1023
01:43:21,493 --> 01:43:25,162
No, actually I was afraid
that you were right to want him.

1024
01:43:29,918 --> 01:43:32,294
I thought he was the better man.

1025
01:43:38,343 --> 01:43:40,135
I know now he's not.

1026
01:43:41,971 --> 01:43:44,014
He's just got more money.

1027
01:45:16,358 --> 01:45:18,275
I think we should talk.

1028
01:45:19,069 --> 01:45:20,652
I am very happy.

1029
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:26,033
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

1030
01:45:27,577 --> 01:45:29,578
I can't say that I have.

1031
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:33,749
-Diana is the reason.
-Enough for any man.

1032
01:45:34,292 --> 01:45:37,211
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

1033
01:45:39,339 --> 01:45:43,592
-You are the best of them.
-The best of them?

1034
01:45:45,011 --> 01:45:48,222
-You said I'm the best of them?
-You are.

1035
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:53,936
I don't understand.

1036
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:58,482
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?

1037
01:45:59,025 --> 01:46:02,653
What? I could do that, sir.

1038
01:46:04,572 --> 01:46:08,200
But somehow I feel Miss Murphy
would rather hear it directly from you.

1039
01:46:08,284 --> 01:46:09,910
Okay. All right.

1040
01:46:11,121 --> 01:46:14,790
She's the best
of the million dollar club. Obviously.

1041
01:46:18,378 --> 01:46:20,879
-Million dollar club?
-Now you got it.

1042
01:46:23,758 --> 01:46:25,592
You told me you had
never done that before.

1043
01:46:25,677 --> 01:46:28,429
How many members
would you say there are?

1044
01:46:28,972 --> 01:46:30,472
-Members?
-Yeah.

1045
01:46:32,434 --> 01:46:34,560
-Worldwide?
-Yeah.

1046
01:46:37,022 --> 01:46:38,981
I think a couple of dozen.

1047
01:46:39,983 --> 01:46:42,985
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccupping?

1048
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:44,069
What?

1049
01:46:44,154 --> 01:46:45,738
The waitress from Oklahoma.

1050
01:46:45,822 --> 01:46:49,074
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse with the hiccups.

1051
01:46:51,494 --> 01:46:53,370
Yeah, I had forgotten.

1052
01:46:54,122 --> 01:46:55,664
Quite a night.

1053
01:46:57,334 --> 01:47:01,795
See, the best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

1054
01:47:03,131 --> 01:47:04,923
right from the start.

1055
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:18,520
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

1056
01:47:48,176 --> 01:47:49,760
Thank you, John.

1057
01:47:54,015 --> 01:47:57,142
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1058
01:48:05,151 --> 01:48:06,318
Here.

1059
01:48:10,865 --> 01:48:12,157
For luck.

1060
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:16,912
Yeah.

1061
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:22,918
-Take care of him.
-Sure.

1062
01:48:31,928 --> 01:48:33,887
What was all that about?

1063
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:37,933
I wanted to end it.

1064
01:48:42,564 --> 01:48:46,108
She never would have looked at me
the way she did at him.

1065
01:49:37,369 --> 01:49:41,497
Seven years ago, David proposed
to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.

1066
01:49:42,665 --> 01:49:46,335
I wanted to go there to remember,
and start over.

1067
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:55,946
Have I ever told you I love you?

1068
01:51:06,291 --> 01:51:07,333
No.

1069
01:51:12,088 --> 01:51:13,213
I do.

1070
01:51:19,512 --> 01:51:20,679
Still?

1071
01:51:25,143 --> 01:51:26,352
Always.
