1
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,106
<i>Once upon a time,
in the hidden heart of France...</i>

2
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,104
<i>a handsome young prince...</i>

3
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,104
<i>lived in a beautiful castle.</i>

4
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,906
<i>Poof! Poof!</i>

5
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,470
<i>Although he had everything
his heart desired...</i>

6
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,623
<i>the prince was selfish and unkind.</i>

7
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,463
<i>Master, it's time.</i>

8
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,785
<i>He taxed the village...</i>

9
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,948
<i>to fill his castle with
the most beautiful objects.</i>

10
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,830
<i>And his parties with
the most beautiful people.</i>

11
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,501
<i>Oh, how divine</i>

12
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,628
<i>Glamour, music and magic combine</i>

13
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,021
<i>See the maidens so anxious to shine</i>

14
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,663
<i>Look for a sign that enhances chances</i>

15
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,624
<i>She'll be his special one</i>

16
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,789
<i>What a display</i>

17
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,460
<i>What a breathtaking, thrilling array</i>

18
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,464
<i>Every prince
Every dog has his day</i>

19
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,789
<i>Let us sing with passion,
gusto, fit to bust, oh</i>

20
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,266
<i>Not a care in the world</i>

21
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,990
<i>Then one night...</i>

22
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,302
<i>an unexpected intruder arrived
at the castle...</i>

23
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,821
<i>seeking shelter from the bitter storm.</i>

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,546
<i>As a gift, she offered
the prince, a single rose.</i>

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,742
<i>Repulsed by her
haggard appearance...</i>

26
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>the prince turned the woman away.</i>

27
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,950
<i>Hmm.</i>

28
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,859
<i>But she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances.</i>

29
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,262
<i>For beauty is found within.</i>

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,102
<i>When he dismissed her again...</i>

31
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,745
<i>the old woman's outward
appearance melted away.</i>

32
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,780
<i>To reveal...</i>

33
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,783
<i>a beautiful enchantress.</i>

34
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,101
<i>The prince begged for forgiveness,</i>

35
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,749
<i>but it was too late.</i>

36
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,782
<i>For she had seen that
there was no love in his heart.</i>

37
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,749
<i>Chip! Chip! Oh, my!</i>

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,226
<i>As punishment...</i>

39
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,510
<i>she transformed him
into a hideous beast.</i>

40
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,589
<i>And placed a powerful spell
on the castle...</i>

41
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,229
<i>and all who lived there.</i>

42
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,427
<i>As days bled into years...</i>

43
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,947
<i>the prince and his servants
were forgotten by the world.</i>

44
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,790
<i>For the enchantress had erased
all memory of them...</i>

45
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,188
<i>from the minds of the
people they loved.</i>

46
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,981
<i>But the rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose.</i>

47
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,267
<i>If he could learn to love another...</i>

48
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,140
<i>and earn their love in return
by the time the last petal fell...</i>

49
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,950
<i>the spell would be broken.</i>

50
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,822
<i>If not, he would be doomed to
remain a beast for all time.</i>

51
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,499
<i>As the years passed...</i>

52
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,629
<i>he fell into despair and lost all hope.</i>

53
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,784
<i>For who could ever
learn to love a beast?</i>

54
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:37,414
<font color=#ff0000>Psagmeno.com</font>

55
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,543
Little town
It's a quiet village

56
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,380
Every day like the one before

57
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,224
Little town
Full of little people

58
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,626
Waking up to say

59
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,222
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

60
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,350
Bonjour!

61
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,265
There goes the baker
with his tray like always

62
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,349
The same old bread and rolls to sell

63
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,383
Every morning just the same

64
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,263
Since the morning that we came

65
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,864
To this poor provincial town

66
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,544
Good morning, Belle!

67
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,380
Good morning, Monsieur Jean!
Have you lost something again?

68
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,705
Well, I believe I have.

69
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,543
The problem is,
I can't remember what!

70
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,190
Oh, well.
I'm sure it will come to me.

71
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,506
Where are you off to?

72
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,022
To return this book to Pere Robert.

73
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,147
It's about two lovers in fair Verona.

74
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,420
Sounds boring.

75
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,230
Look there she goes
That girl is strange, no question

76
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,427
Dazed and distracted
Can't you tell?

77
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,549
Never part of any crowd

78
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,223
'Cause her head's up on some cloud

79
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,020
No denying she's a
funny girl that Belle

80
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,380
Bonjour, good day, how is your family?

81
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,662
Bonjour, good day, how is your wife?

82
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,789
I need six eggs
That's too expensive

83
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,422
There must be more
than this provincial life

84
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,950
Ah, if it isn't the
only bookworm in town.

85
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,909
So, where did you run off to this week?

86
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,584
Two cities in Northern Italy.

87
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,269
I didn't want to come back!

88
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,268
Have you got any new places to go?

89
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,390
I'm afraid not.

90
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,630
But you may reread any of
the old ones that you'd like.

91
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,710
Thank you.

92
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,990
Your library makes
our small corner of the world feel big.

93
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,339
Bye.

94
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,580
Look, there she goes
The girl is so peculiar

95
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,105
I wonder if she's feeling well

96
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,620
With a dreamy far off look
And her nose stuck in a book

97
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,386
What a puzzle to the
rest of us is Belle

98
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,981
Oh! Isn't this amazing

99
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:26,221
It's my favorite part
because you'll see

100
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,828
Here's where she meets Prince Charming

101
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,909
But she won't discover that it's him

102
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,663
'Til chapter three

103
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,587
Now it's no wonder
That her name means "beauty"

104
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,222
Her looks have got no parallel

105
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,980
But behind that fair faÃ§ade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

106
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,948
Very different from the rest of us

107
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,022
She's nothing like the rest of us

108
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,421
Yes, different from the rest of us

109
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,183
Is Belle

110
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,345
Look at her, LeFou.

111
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,261
My future wife.

112
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,865
Belle is the most
beautiful girl in the village.

113
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,583
That makes her the best.

114
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,702
But she's so well-read.

115
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,628
And you're so...

116
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,350
- athletically inclined.
- I know.

117
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,260
Belle can be as argumentative
as she is beautiful.

118
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,024
Exactly! Who needs her
when you've got us!

119
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,590
Yes...

120
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,070
But ever since the war,

121
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,187
I've felt like
I've been missing something.

122
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,985
And she's the only girl
that gives me that sense of...

123
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,069
I don't know what that means.

124
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,710
Right from the moment

125
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,225
When I met her, saw her

126
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,105
I said she's gorgeous and I fell

127
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,349
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me

128
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,140
So I'm making plans to
woo and marry Belle

129
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,823
Look there he goes

130
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,143
Isn't he dreamy

131
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,667
Monsieur Gaston, oh, he's so cute

132
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,383
Be still, my heart
I'm hardly breathing

133
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,187
He's such a tall, dark
Strong and handsome brute

134
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,745
It's never gonna happen, ladies.

135
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,390
- Bonjour.
- Pardon.

136
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,550
- Good day.
- Mais, oui.

137
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,350
- You call this bacon.
- What lovely flowers.

138
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,430
- Some cheese.
- Ten yards.

139
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,590
- One pound.
- 'Scuse me

140
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,429
- I'll get the knife.
- Please let me through.

141
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,341
- This bread.
- Those fish.

142
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,430
- It's stale.
- They smell.

143
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,949
- Madame's mistaken.
- Well, maybe so.

144
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,828
There must be more
than this provincial life

145
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,503
Good morning

146
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,661
Just watch I'm going
to make Belle my wife

147
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,628
Oh! Good morning

148
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,380
Look there she goes
A girl who's strange but special

149
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,782
A most peculiar mademoiselle

150
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,665
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

151
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,380
But she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl

152
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,466
She really is a funny girl

153
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,466
That Belle

154
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,144
Good morning, Belle!

155
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,223
Wonderful book you have there.

156
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,144
Have you read it?

157
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,465
Well, not that one.
But, you know, books...

158
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,422
For your dinner table.

159
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,944
Shall I join you this evening?

160
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,666
Sorry, not this evening.

161
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,230
Busy?

162
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,830
No...

163
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,662
So, moving on?

164
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,150
No, LeFou.

165
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,263
It's the ones who play hard to get

166
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,103
that are always the sweetest prey.

167
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,949
That's what makes Belle so appealing.

168
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,469
She hasn't made a fool of herself

169
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,348
just to gain my favor.

170
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,024
What would you call that?

171
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,550
Dignity?

172
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,548
It's outrageously attractive, isn't it?

173
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,670
Gaston!

174
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,939
Mmm.

175
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,230
Mmm.

176
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,990
How does a moment last forever

177
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,024
How can a story never die

178
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,908
It is love we must hold on to

179
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,106
Never easy but we try

180
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,381
Sometimes our happiness is captured

181
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,750
Somehow a time and place stand still

182
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,065
Love lives on inside our hearts

183
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,869
And always will

184
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,070
Oh.

185
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,384
Belle.

186
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,710
Hmm.

187
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,584
Could you...

188
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,670
Hand me a...

189
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,149
Thank you.

190
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,266
And I also need...

191
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,581
No. No. No.

192
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,790
Actually...

193
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,425
yes, that's exactly
what I need. Thank you.

194
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,907
- Papa, do you think I'm odd?
- Odd?

195
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,268
My daughter? Odd?

196
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,103
Where did you get an idea like that?

197
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,263
I don't know. People talk.

198
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,546
This is a small village, you know.

199
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,781
Small minded as well.

200
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,747
But small also means safe.

201
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,984
Even back in Paris,

202
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,301
I knew a girl like you, who was so...

203
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,782
ahead of her time.

204
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,828
So different.

205
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,579
People mocked her.

206
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,027
Until the day they all found
themselves imitating her.

207
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,790
Please, just tell me
one more thing about her.

208
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,187
Your mother was...

209
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,266
fearless.

210
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,350
Fearless.

211
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,070
So...

212
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,741
what can I bring you from the market?

213
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,545
A rose. Like the one in the painting.

214
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,548
You ask for that every year!

215
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,383
And every year you bring it.

216
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,710
Then I shall bring you another.

217
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,348
You have my word.

218
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,990
- Goodbye, Papa.
- Goodbye, Belle.

219
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,382
Come on, Philippe.

220
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,750
You know the way.

221
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,060
I'll see you tomorrow!

222
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,547
Right. Tomorrow, with the rose.

223
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,503
Stay safe.

224
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,383
What are you doing?

225
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,430
The laundry.

226
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,510
Come! Come!

227
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,468
"The blue bird..."

228
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,826
"That flies...

229
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,259
"over the dark...

230
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,670
"wood."

231
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,940
That was amazing!

232
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,301
What on earth are you doing?

233
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,826
Teaching another girl to read?

234
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,987
Isn't one enough?

235
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,789
We have to do something.

236
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,867
You are the wildest...

237
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,789
most gorgeous thing I have ever seen.

238
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,670
Nobody deserves you.

239
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,504
But at least I know
our children will be beautiful.

240
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,946
Am I catching you at a bad time?

241
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,784
- What is it, LeFou?
- A certain damsel is in distress.

242
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,068
Ah. It's hero time.

243
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,748
I'm not done with you yet.

244
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,466
Me, neither.

245
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,867
Belle! I heard you had trouble
with the Headmaster.

246
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,510
He never liked me either.

247
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,627
Can I give you a little advice
about the villagers though?

248
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,862
They're never going to trust the kind
of change you're trying to bring.

249
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,510
All I wanted was to
teach a child to read.

250
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,100
The only children you should
concern yourself with...

251
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,986
are your own.

252
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,545
I'm...

253
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,627
not ready to have children.

254
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,383
Maybe you haven't met the right man.

255
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,622
It's a small village, Gaston.
I've met them all.

256
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,065
Well, maybe you should
take another look.

257
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,943
Some of us have changed.

258
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,021
Gaston...

259
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,267
we could never make each other happy.

260
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,509
No one can change that much.

261
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,706
Oh, Belle.

262
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,150
Do you know what happens
to spinsters in this village

263
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,380
after their fathers die?

264
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,382
Coins? Got any spare coins?

265
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,543
They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe.

266
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,225
This is our world, Belle.

267
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,465
For simple folk like us,
it doesn't get any better.

268
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,309
I might be a farm girl.

269
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,905
But, I'm not simple...

270
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,984
and I'm never going
to marry you, Gaston.

271
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,106
I'm sorry!

272
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,103
Can you imagine?

273
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,149
Me? The wife of that boorish...

274
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,270
brainless...

275
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,626
Madame Gaston, can't you just see it

276
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,390
Madame Gaston, his little wife

277
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,506
Ugh!

278
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,828
No, sir, not me, I guarantee it

279
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,984
I want much more than
this provincial life

280
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,305
I want adventure
in the great wide somewhere

281
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,144
I want it more than I can tell

282
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,224
And for once it might be grand

283
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,230
To have someone understand

284
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,347
I want so much more
Than they've got planned

285
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,501
The woods are lovely.

286
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,503
I only wish I recognized them.

287
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,862
Do you know where we are,
Philippe? Because I don't.

288
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,864
It's all right. It's
all right, Philippe.

289
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,670
Hmm.

290
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,461
Yes, we can go this way.

291
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,303
Go on. To the right.

292
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,101
That's it. Steady!

293
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,704
Walk on!

294
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,305
One path closes...

295
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,710
another one opens.

296
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,899
It's all right, boy.
It's just a bit of snow.

297
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,589
In June.

298
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,870
Mind your step.

299
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,030
It's slippery.

300
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,259
Go! Go, Philippe! Come on! Come on!

301
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,467
Whoa.

302
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,784
Come on!

303
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,269
Go! Philippe, go! Go, go!

304
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,544
Whoa!

305
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,384
Philippe!

306
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,224
Good boy.

307
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,422
Go, boy. Go!

308
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,707
Oh, Philippe, you saved my life.

309
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,429
Well done. Yes.

310
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,510
They'll have to get
their dinner somewhere else,

311
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,825
won't they?

312
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,419
Look!

313
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,740
There's hay.

314
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,466
And water.

315
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,145
You're all set, my old friend.

316
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:35,429
I'll go pay my respects
to our unwitting host.

317
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,301
Whoever that may be.

318
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,310
Hmm.

319
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,145
Thank you.

320
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,145
Thank...

321
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,020
Hello?

322
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,030
Hello?

323
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,783
Sorry to intrude.

324
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,987
I'm just a traveler...

325
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,059
seeking shelter from the storm.

326
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,542
Sorry to disturb you.

327
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,624
Anyone home?

328
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,110
Anyone awake?

329
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,703
He must have lost his way in the woods.

330
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,782
Shut up, you idiot!

331
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,069
Excuse me?

332
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,943
Hmm.

333
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,868
Beautiful.

334
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,069
Extraordinary.

335
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,860
A man of taste.

336
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,589
He was talking about me.

337
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,306
Oops!

338
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,423
Well, wherever you are...

339
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,066
I'm just going to warm
myself by the fire.

340
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,870
That's better.

341
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,663
Oh, much better.

342
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,950
Ooh.

343
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,510
Thank you.

344
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,222
Mum said I wasn't supposed to move
because it might be scary.

345
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,140
Sorry.

346
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,223
It's all right.

347
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,510
I, uh...

348
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,350
I cannot...

349
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,506
thank you enough for your hospitality.

350
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,544
I'll...

351
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,189
bid you adieu...

352
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,907
and good night.

353
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,665
Come on, Philippe! Go! Go!

354
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,388
No, wait, wait, wait!

355
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,342
Roses. I nearly forgot.

356
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,869
We're safe here.

357
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,662
I promised Belle a rose.

358
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,910
There!

359
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,190
Philippe!

360
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,420
What happened?

361
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,184
Where's Papa?

362
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,630
Take me to him!

363
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,142
Look, Cogsworth.

364
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,670
A beautiful girl!

365
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,186
Yes! I can see it's a girl.

366
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,349
I lost my hands, not my eyes.

367
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,989
But what if she is the one?

368
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,783
The one who'll break the spell?

369
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,740
Who said that?

370
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,110
Who's there?

371
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,220
Uh-oh.

372
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,145
Papa?

373
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,784
Papa, is that you?

374
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,026
Belle!

375
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,749
How did you find me?

376
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,749
Your hands are ice.

377
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,065
We need to get you home.

378
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,227
Belle, you must leave here at once!

379
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,945
This castle is alive!

380
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,663
Now go, before he finds you!

381
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,820
Who?

382
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,589
Who's there?

383
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,750
Who are you?

384
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,708
Who are you?

385
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,981
I've come for my father.

386
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,583
Your father is a thief.

387
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,184
Liar!

388
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,499
He stole a rose.

389
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,303
I asked for the rose.

390
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,910
Punish me, not him.

391
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,022
No! He means forever.

392
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,269
Apparently, that's what
happens around here

393
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,466
when you pick a flower.

394
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,306
A life sentence for a rose?

395
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,510
I received eternal damnation for one.

396
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,906
I'm merely locking him away.

397
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,668
Now, do you still wish
to take your father's place?

398
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,144
Come into the light.

399
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,100
Choose.

400
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,540
Belle, I won't let you do this.

401
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,223
I lost your mother.

402
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,620
I won't lose you, too.

403
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,224
Now, go.

404
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,029
Go!

405
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,421
All right, Papa. I'll leave.

406
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,229
I need a minute alone with him.

407
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,070
Are you so cold-hearted...

408
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,984
you won't allow a daughter
to kiss her father goodbye?

409
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,501
Forever can spare a minute.

410
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,741
When this door closes,
it will not open again.

411
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,909
I should have been with you.

412
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,101
Oh, no, no. Belle, listen to me.

413
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,109
It's all right.

414
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,704
Now go.

415
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,550
Live your life.

416
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,030
And forget me.

417
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,590
Forget you?

418
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,588
Everything I am is because of you.

419
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,303
I love you, Belle.

420
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,699
Don't be afraid.

421
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,342
I love you too, Papa.

422
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,709
I'm not afraid.

423
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,109
And I will escape. I promise.

424
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,540
What?

425
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,025
You took his place.

426
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,703
He's my father.

427
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,270
He's a fool.

428
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,548
And so are you.

429
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,870
Belle...

430
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,186
Papa!

431
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,068
Don't hurt him!

432
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,379
- Papa!
- No!

433
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,740
I'll come back!

434
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,739
I promise!

435
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,141
Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle...

436
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,303
but I have come to escort you
to your room.

437
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,143
My room?

438
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,384
- But I thought...
- Oh, what?

439
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,225
That "Once this door closes
it will not open again"?

440
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,267
I know.

441
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,460
He gets so dramatic.

442
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,269
Hello.

443
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,870
Ooh!

444
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,030
Oh, you are very strong.

445
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,829
This is a great quality.

446
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,546
What are you?

447
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,305
I am Lumiere!

448
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,820
And you can talk?

449
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,141
Well, of course he can talk.

450
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,309
It's all he ever does.

451
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,505
Now, Lumiere, as head
of the household...

452
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,469
I demand that you put her
back in her cell at once.

453
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,749
What do you want to be
for the rest of your life, Cogsworth?

454
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,469
A man, or a mantle clock?

455
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,426
Ready, miss?

456
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,742
- Trust me.
- Oh...

457
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,985
You must forgive first impressions.

458
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,430
I hope you are not too startled.

459
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,302
Why would I be startled?

460
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,430
I'm talking to a candle.

461
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,143
Candelabra, please.

462
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,585
Enormous difference.

463
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,150
But consider me at your service.
The castle is your home now...

464
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,108
so feel free to go anywhere you like.

465
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,150
Except the west wing.

466
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,503
Which we do not have.

467
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,099
Why? What's in the west wing?

468
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,270
- Oh, nothing.
- Nothing.

469
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,710
- Storage space.
- Storage space.

470
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,906
- That's it.
- That's it.

471
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,030
Yes, that's it.

472
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,550
This way, please. To the east wing.

473
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,545
Or as I like to call it, the only wing.

474
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,781
Watch your step, s'il vous plaÃ®t!

475
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,741
Welcome to your new home.

476
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,668
It's modest, but comfortable.

477
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,788
It's beautiful.

478
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,270
But of course!

479
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,859
Master wanted you to have
the finest room in the castle.

480
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,705
Oh, dear. We were not expecting guests.

481
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,621
EnchantÃ©e, mademoiselle.

482
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,425
Don't worry.

483
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,304
I'll have this place
spotless in no time.

484
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,741
This plan of yours is dangerous.

485
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,948
I would risk anything
to kiss you again, Plumette.

486
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,665
No, my love. I've been
burned by you before.

487
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,750
We must be strong.

488
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,186
How can I be strong
when you make me so weak?

489
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,824
Is everything here alive?

490
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,387
Hello. What's your name?

491
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,342
That is a hairbrush.

492
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,263
Do not be alarmed.

493
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,506
This is just your wardrobe.

494
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,220
Meet Madame De Garderobe.
A great singer.

495
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,903
When she can stay awake.

496
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,701
Cogsworth! A diva needs
her beauty rest.

497
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,861
Stay with us, Madame.

498
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,464
We have someone for you to dress!

499
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,786
Finally...

500
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,942
a woman.

501
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,101
Pretty eyes.

502
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,190
Proud face.

503
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,108
Perfect canvas. Yes!

504
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,627
I will find you something
worthy of a princess.

505
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,826
Oh, I'm not a princess.

506
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,140
Nonsense!

507
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,944
Now, let's see
what I've got in my drawers.

508
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,665
Oh!

509
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,150
How embarrassing.

510
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,188
Froufrou, come help Mama.

511
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,621
Subtle. Understated. I love it!

512
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,148
Froufrou, send my love to the maestro.

513
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,183
Picture it, LeFou.

514
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,744
A rustic cabin...

515
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,510
my latest kill roasting on the fire...

516
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,549
adorable children running
around us as my love...

517
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,829
rubs my tired feet.

518
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,742
But what does Belle say?

519
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,379
"I will never marry you, Gaston!"

520
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,940
You know, there are other girls.

521
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,826
A great hunter doesn't
waste his time on rabbits.

522
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,068
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston

523
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,222
Looking so down in the dumps

524
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,543
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston

525
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,669
Even when taking your lumps

526
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,703
There's no man in town
as admired as you

527
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,783
You're everyone's favorite guy

528
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,140
Everyone's awed and inspired by you

529
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,908
And it's not very hard to see why

530
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,950
No one's slick as Gaston

531
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,743
No one's quick as Gaston

532
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,341
No one's neck's as
incredibly thick as Gaston

533
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,821
For there's no man in
town half as manly

534
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,267
Perfect, a pure paragon

535
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,269
You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley

536
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,425
And they'll tell you
whose team they prefer to be on

537
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:35,506
Who plays

538
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,710
Darts like Gaston?

539
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,623
- Who breaks
- Hearts like Gaston?

540
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,589
Who's much more than the sum
of his parts like Gaston?

541
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,909
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating

542
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,108
My, what a guy, that Gaston

543
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,624
I needed encouragement

544
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,104
Thank you, LeFou

545
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,509
Well, there's no one
As easy to bolster as you

546
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,540
Too much?

547
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,905
Yep!

548
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:05,309
No one fights like Gaston

549
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,063
Douses lights like Gaston

550
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,985
In a wrestling match
Nobody bites like Gaston

551
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,670
When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver

552
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,741
And beasts of the field say a prayer

553
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,630
Aah...

554
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,666
First I carefully aim for the liver

555
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,750
Then I shoot from behind

556
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,940
Is that fair?

557
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,430
I don't care

558
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,183
No one hits like Gaston

559
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,630
Matches wits like Gaston

560
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,590
In a spitting match
nobody spits like Gaston

561
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,220
I'm especially good at expectorating

562
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,148
Ooh!

563
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,828
Ten points for Gaston!

564
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,669
Thank you. Thank you.

565
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,468
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs

566
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,270
Every morning to help me get large

567
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,182
And now that I'm grown
I eat five dozen eggs

568
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,344
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

569
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:08,829
Hey! Hey!

570
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,181
Hey!

571
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,420
Hey!

572
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,021
Hey!

573
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,022
Hey! Hey!

574
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,267
Hey! Hey! Hey!

575
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,264
Who has brains

576
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,350
Like Gaston

577
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,944
- Entertains
- Like Gaston

578
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,139
Who can make up
these endless refrains like Gaston

579
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:19,870
I use antlers in all of my decorating

580
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,782
Say it again

581
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,582
Who's a man among men?

582
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,583
Who's a super success?

583
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,104
Don't you know? Can't you guess?

584
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,263
Ask his fans and his five hangers-on

585
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:38,501
There's just one guy in town
Who's got all of it down

586
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:45,468
And his name's, G-A-S-T

587
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,065
I believe there's another 'T'

588
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,189
It just occurred to me
that I'm illiterate

589
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,663
And I've never actually had
to spell it out loud before

590
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,068
Gaston

591
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,305
Oh, LeFou, you're the best.

592
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,666
How is it no girl has
snatched you up yet?

593
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,181
I've been told I'm clingy,
but I really don't get it.

594
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,270
Please, please. Someone, someone.

595
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,630
- You, help...
- Whoa, whoa.

596
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,860
You must help me.

597
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,623
It's Belle! He's got, he's got Belle.

598
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,939
She's locked in a dungeon.

599
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,350
Who's got her?

600
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,301
A beast!

601
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,219
A huge, horrid, monstrous beast!

602
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,703
My daughter's life is in danger.

603
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,066
Why do you laugh? It's not a joke.

604
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,025
His castle is hidden in the woods.

605
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,107
It's already winter there.

606
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,022
Winter in June?

607
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,829
Crazy old Maurice!

608
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,867
Listen to me!

609
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,589
The beast is real.

610
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,942
Do you understand?

611
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,386
Will no one help me?

612
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,666
I'll help, Maurice.

613
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,830
What?

614
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,344
You will?

615
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,739
Everybody...

616
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,066
stop making fun of this man at once.

617
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,863
Captain, thank you.

618
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,942
Don't thank me, Maurice.

619
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,863
Lead us to the beast.

620
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,624
Come.

621
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,910
Hmm.

622
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,910
Oh.

623
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,343
Mama! There's a girl in the castle!

624
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,063
Yes, Chip, we know!

625
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,269
What kind of tea does she like?

626
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,068
Herbal, oolong...

627
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,425
chamomile...

628
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,590
I'm too excited!

629
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,430
Slow down before you break your handle.

630
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,910
- Heads up, Mrs. Potts.
- Oh.

631
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,790
Lumiere!

632
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,228
- Oh!
- Be calm. Let me do the talking.

633
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,624
You're making her dinner!

634
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,750
Well, we thought you might
appreciate the company.

635
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,986
Master, I just want to assure you...

636
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,942
that I had no part in
this hopeless plan.

637
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,104
Preparing a dinner, designing
a gown for her, giving her...

638
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,630
a suite in the east wing!

639
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,509
You gave her a bedroom?

640
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,110
No, no, no. He gave her a bedroom.

641
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,426
This is true.

642
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,469
But if this girl is the one
who can break the spell...

643
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,190
then maybe you could start
by using dinner to charm her.

644
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,501
- Good thinking, Cogsworth.
- What?

645
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,869
That's the most ridiculous idea...

646
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,987
I've ever heard. Charm the prisoner!

647
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,824
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

648
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,942
we become less human.

649
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,346
She's the daughter of a common thief.

650
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,149
What kind of person do you
think that makes her?

651
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,982
Oh, you can't judge people...

652
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,301
by who their father is, now can you?

653
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,349
You'll join me for dinner.

654
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,830
That's not a request.

655
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,310
Gently, Master.

656
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,944
The girl lost her father...

657
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,828
and her freedom in one day.

658
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,664
Yes, the poor thing is probably
in there, scared to death.

659
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,980
Exactly.

660
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,343
Just a minute.

661
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,907
You see? There she is.
Now, remember, be gentle.

662
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,982
- Kind!
- Charming!

663
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:24,867
Sweet!

664
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:29,229
And when she opens the door,
give her a dashing, debonair smile.

665
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,670
Come, come. Show me the smile.

666
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,340
- Oh, mon dieu!
- Oh, no.

667
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,180
Will you join me for dinner?

668
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,503
You've taken me as your prisoner

669
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,866
and now you want to
have dinner with me?

670
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,705
Are you insane?

671
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,547
Uh-oh. He's losing it.

672
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,070
Oh, dear!

673
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,941
I told you to join me for dinner.

674
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,550
And I told you no.

675
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:03,265
Ooh! What time is it?

676
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,506
What's happening?

677
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,663
I'd starve before I ever ate with you.

678
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,019
Well, be my guest.

679
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,863
Go ahead and starve.

680
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:14,350
If she doesn't eat with me...

681
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,864
then she doesn't eat at all.

682
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,860
Idiots!

683
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,825
You can't talk to us
like that. I forbid it.

684
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,904
Uh... Oh. Am I too late?

685
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,585
Shame, I was really going to
tell him off this time.

686
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,821
Oh, Master, you've returned.

687
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,822
- Oh, very funny.
- I got you there.

688
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,063
Show me the girl.

689
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,825
Another petal fell.

690
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,990
Lumiere...

691
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,981
I grew three more feathers.
And I just plucked yesterday.

692
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,147
I know, darling.

693
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,664
I'm getting more metallic every day.

694
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,903
Oh, no. It's happening again.
Pardon me.

695
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,062
Oh, everyone, calm yourselves.

696
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,223
- We still have time.
- Mama...

697
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,740
am I ever going to be a boy again?

698
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,390
Oh, yes, Chip. You'll have your days...

699
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:01,309
in the sun again. You
just leave it to me.

700
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,023
I told you to go away.

701
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,949
Don't worry, dear. It's only Mrs.
Potts.

702
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,870
Oh!

703
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,624
Oh, aren't you a vision!

704
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:28,790
How lovely...

705
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,146
to make your acquaintance.

706
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,387
It's a very long journey.
Let me fix you up...

707
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,824
before you go.

708
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,106
I have found...

709
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,665
that most troubles
seem less troubling...

710
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,822
after a bracing cup of tea.

711
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,430
Slowly now, Chip.

712
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,390
Pleased to meet you.

713
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:57,830
Wanna see me do a trick?

714
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,670
Chip!

715
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:05,304
That was a very brave thing
you did for your father, dearie.

716
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,069
Yes.

717
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,709
We all think so.

718
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,065
I'm worried about him.

719
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,185
He's never been on his own.

720
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,063
Cheer up, my poppet.

721
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,580
Things will turn out in the end.

722
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,990
You'll feel a lot better...

723
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,504
after dinner.

724
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,389
But he said, "If she
doesn't eat with me,

725
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,870
then she doesn't eat at all."

726
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,779
Mmm, people say a lot
of things in anger.

727
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,867
It is our choice whether
or not to listen.

728
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,500
You coming, poppet?

729
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,110
Go!

730
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,509
They are coming. Final checks,
everyone! Tout de suite!

731
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:36,670
No, you don't!

732
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,630
If the master finds out
you violated his orders

733
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,230
and fed her he will blame me!

734
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,710
Yes, I will make sure of it.

735
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,509
But did you see her stand up to him?

736
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,383
I am telling you, this girl is the one.

737
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,670
They must fall in love
if we are to be human again...

738
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,910
and how can they fall in love
if she stays in her room?

739
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,623
Hey, Chapeau, you missed a spot.

740
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,270
You know she'll never love him.

741
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,383
A broken clock is right
two times a day, mon ami...

742
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,309
but this is not one of those times.
Stand up straight!

743
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,903
It's time to sparkle!

744
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,789
Mmm! I have no taste buds,

745
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,384
but I can tell this is exquisite.

746
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,303
Off! Off me while I work!

747
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,541
Pepper, get cracking!
Salt, shake a leg!

748
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,623
Not so loud! Keep it down.

749
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,941
Of course, of course!
But what is dinner...

750
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,623
without a little music?

751
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:15,830
Music?

752
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,630
Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?

753
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,066
It has been so long
since I have performed.

754
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,665
I can barely even remember how.

755
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,989
- Ah!
- Ooh!

756
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,659
Another cavity.

757
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,588
Maestro, your wife is upstairs...

758
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,140
finding it harder and harder
to stay awake.

759
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,229
She's counting on you
to help us break this curse.

760
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:43,343
Then I shall play through
the dental pain.

761
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,985
Maestro, play quietly, please.

762
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,026
Oh, quietly. Sotto voce! Of course!

763
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,466
Are there any other
tasteless demands...

764
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,910
you wish to make upon my artistry?

765
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,626
No, that's it.

766
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,702
There you are, dear.

767
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,622
Ma chere mademoiselle.

768
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,381
It is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure...

769
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,348
that we welcome you tonight.

770
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,746
Here! And now...

771
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,987
we invite you to relax.

772
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,744
Let us pull up a chair...

773
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:25,386
as the dining room proudly presents...

774
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,427
Your dinner!

775
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,899
Be our guest, be our guest

776
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,824
Put our service to the test

777
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,744
Tie your napkin 'round
your neck, chÃ©rie

778
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,862
And we'll provide the rest

779
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,829
Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres

780
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,822
Why we only live to serve

781
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,345
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious

782
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,990
Don't believe me? Ask the dishes

783
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,744
They can sing, they can dance

784
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,106
After all, miss, this is France

785
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,105
And a dinner here is never second best

786
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,985
Go on unfold your menu

787
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,624
Take a glance and then you'll

788
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,862
Be our guest, oui, our guest

789
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,623
Be our guest

790
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,790
Ooh!

791
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,220
Beef ragout

792
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,664
Cheese soufflÃ©

793
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,304
Pie and pudding en flambÃ©

794
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,259
We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret

795
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,625
You're alone and you're scared

796
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,781
But the banquet's all prepared

797
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,663
No one's gloomy or complaining

798
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,742
While the flatware's entertaining

799
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,503
We tell jokes, I do tricks

800
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:52,270
With my fellow candlesticks

801
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:55,941
And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet

802
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,141
Come on and lift your glass

803
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,381
You've won your own free pass

804
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,143
To be our guest

805
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,109
If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

806
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,190
Be our guest

807
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:11,146
Be our guest, be our guest

808
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,624
Life is so unnerving

809
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,100
For a servant who's not serving

810
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,264
He's not whole
Without a soul to wait upon

811
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,223
Ah, those good old days
when we were useful

812
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,261
Eh, Cogsworth?

813
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,583
Suddenly those good old days are gone

814
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,548
Too long we've been rusting

815
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,509
Needing so much more than dusting

816
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:43,027
Needing exercise,
a chance to use our skills

817
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,308
Most days we just lay around the castle

818
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,950
Flabby, fat and lazy

819
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,226
You walked in and whoops-a-daisy

820
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,103
It's a guest, it's a guest

821
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,147
Sakes alive, well, I'll be blessed

822
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:01,108
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord

823
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,261
I've had the napkins freshly pressed

824
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,507
With dessert, she'll want tea

825
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,468
And my dear, that's fine with me

826
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,508
While the cups do their soft-shoeing

827
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,145
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing

828
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,622
I'll get warm, piping hot

829
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,383
Heaven's sakes, is that a spot?

830
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,305
Clean it up, we want
the company impressed

831
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:32,302
We've got a lot to do

832
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,501
Is it one lump or two?

833
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,024
For you, our guest

834
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:39,467
She's our guest

835
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,343
Be our guest, be our guest

836
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,268
Our command is your request

837
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,144
It's been years since we've had anybody

838
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,550
Here and we're obsessed

839
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,667
With your meal

840
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,907
With your ease

841
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:56,110
Yes indeed, we aim to please

842
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,944
While the candlelight's still glowing

843
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,426
Let us help you, we'll keep going

844
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:11,028
Course by

845
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:14,740
Course! One by one

846
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,584
'Til you shout, "Enough, I'm done!"

847
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,707
Then we'll sing you off to sleep

848
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,383
As you digest

849
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:25,948
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now let's eat up

850
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,904
Be our guest

851
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,383
Be our guest

852
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:37,626
Please be our guest

853
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:41,950
Pudding?

854
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,020
I don't understand why
you're all being so kind to me.

855
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,866
Surely, you're as trapped here as I am.

856
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,549
Don't you ever want to escape?

857
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:57,620
The master's not
as terrible as he appears.

858
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,386
Somewhere deep in his soul,
there's a prince...

859
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:05,629
of a fellow who just waiting
to be set free.

860
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,345
Lumiere mentioned something
about the west wing.

861
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,979
Never you mind about that.

862
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,230
Off to bed with you, poppet.

863
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,626
- Good night.
- Nighty-night.

864
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,183
Straight to bed.

865
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,342
What are you doing here?
What did you do to it?

866
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,341
Nothing.

867
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,749
Do you realize what
you could have done?

868
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,104
You could have damned us all!

869
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,385
Get out of here!

870
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,590
Go!

871
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,622
Checkmate. Again.

872
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,622
Wait! No! You cheated again.

873
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,470
Mademoiselle, what are you doing?

874
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,303
Getting out of here.

875
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,665
Stop!

876
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:25,905
Go! Go! Froufrou!

877
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,070
Yes, Froufrou. Stop her.

878
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:30,630
Don't let her leave!

879
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,389
Stop her!

880
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,470
No! No! Froufrou!

881
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:34,819
No! No, it's not play time!

882
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,902
Not now, silly boy.

883
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,424
Bad dog. Bad dog!

884
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:40,143
No! No! No!

885
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,539
Please don't go!

886
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,786
It's dangerous!

887
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,623
Oh, my!

888
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,466
You have to help me.

889
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,708
You have to stand.

890
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:46,300
No! I'm sure this is the way.

891
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:47,699
Do you hear those wolves?

892
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,829
That means we're getting
very close to the castle.

893
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,670
Look, enough is enough.
We have to turn back.

894
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:54,707
Stop!

895
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,026
That's it! There it is!

896
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,349
That's the tree!

897
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,620
I'm sure of it.

898
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,340
It was downed by lightning at the time.

899
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:06,263
But now...

900
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,262
it's resumed an upright position...

901
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,579
through some sort of...

902
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:12,501
magic or other.

903
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,781
You really wanna marry
into this family?

904
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:15,950
So, that means...

905
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:17,860
that the castle is that...

906
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:18,950
No.

907
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,780
No, it's...

908
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,390
That way.

909
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,189
Definitely, that way.

910
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:29,588
I am done playing this game of yours.

911
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,343
Where is Belle?

912
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,427
The beast took her and she...

913
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,707
There are no such things as beasts.

914
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:37,622
Or talking teacups.

915
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,019
Or magic!

916
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,581
But there are wolves,
frostbite, and starvation.

917
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:45,468
Deep breaths, Gaston.

918
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,707
Deep breaths.

919
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,508
So, why don't we just turn around?
Go back to Villeneuve.

920
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,145
I'm sure Belle is at home,
cooking up a lovely dinner.

921
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,790
If you think I've made all this up...

922
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,783
then why did you offer to help?

923
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,583
Because I want to marry your daughter!

924
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,586
Now, let's go home.

925
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,508
Belle is not at home.

926
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:10,990
She is with the...

927
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:13,949
You say beast one more time...

928
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,902
I will feed you to the wolves!

929
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:18,425
Gaston! Stop it! Breathe!

930
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,667
Think happy thoughts.
Go back to the war.

931
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,224
Blood.

932
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:24,825
Explosions. Countless widows.

933
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,270
- Widows.
- Yes. Yes.

934
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,710
That's it.

935
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,583
That's it.

936
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,384
Maurice!

937
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,900
Please, forgive me, old bean.

938
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,306
That's no way to talk
to my future father-in-law...

939
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,430
now is it?

940
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,546
Future father-in-law?

941
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:43,670
Yeah!

942
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,864
You will never marry my daughter.

943
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,230
I saw that coming.

944
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:58,220
If Maurice won't give
me his blessing...

945
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,182
then he is in my way.

946
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,909
Once the wolves are
finished with him...

947
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,584
Belle will have no one
to take care of her but me.

948
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,630
For the sake of exhausting
all of our options...

949
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,179
do we maybe wanna consider
a slightly less...

950
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,949
gruesome alternative?

951
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,030
Are you coming?

952
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,030
Yah!

953
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,990
That hurts!

954
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,949
If you held still,
it wouldn't hurt as much.

955
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:32,389
Well, if you hadn't run away,
none of this would have happened.

956
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,709
Well, if you hadn't frightened me,
I wouldn't have run away.

957
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,550
Well, you shouldn't have been
in the west wing.

958
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,350
Well, you should learn
to control your temper!

959
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,179
Try to get some rest.

960
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:52,499
Thank you, miss.

961
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:55,190
We are eternally grateful.

962
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,785
Why do you care about him so much?

963
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,350
We've looked after him all his life.

964
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,944
But he's cursed you somehow. Why?

965
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,180
You did nothing!

966
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,585
You're quite right there, dear.

967
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:10,788
You see, when the master
lost his mother...

968
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:13,982
and his cruel father
took that sweet, innocent lad...

969
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:18,220
and twisted him up to
be just like him...

970
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,787
we did nothing.

971
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,304
Let him sleep.

972
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,746
Days in the sun

973
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:40,904
When my life has barely begun

974
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:45,110
Not until my whole life is done

975
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:49,264
Will I ever leave you

976
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:14,187
Will I tremble again

977
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:18,390
To my dear one's gorgeous refrain

978
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:22,464
Will you now forever remain

979
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:27,586
Out of reach of my arms

980
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,788
Oh, those days in the sun

981
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:34,990
What I'd give to relive just one

982
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,504
'Night, Mama.

983
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,026
Undo what's done

984
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,826
And bring back the light

985
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:47,506
Oh, I could sing

986
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:52,699
Of the pain these dark days bring

987
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:57,780
The spell we're under

988
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:03,105
Still it's the wonder of us
I sing of tonight

989
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:07,059
How in the midst of all this sorrow

990
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,746
Can so much hope and love endure

991
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:14,790
I was innocent and certain

992
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:18,660
Now I'm wiser but unsure

993
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:20,423
Days in the past

994
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,706
I can't go back into my childhood

995
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,260
Oh, those precious days couldn't last

996
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,865
One that my father made secure

997
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,141
I can feel a change in me

998
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:35,144
Oh, hold me closer

999
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,870
I'm stronger now but still not free

1000
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,670
Days in the sun

1001
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:45,990
Will return we must believe

1002
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:50,702
As lovers do

1003
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,669
That days in the sun

1004
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:59,861
Will come shining through

1005
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,546
What happens when the last petal falls?

1006
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,508
The master remains a beast forever.

1007
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,343
And we become...

1008
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,103
- Antiques.
- Knick-knacks.

1009
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:13,784
Lightly-used houseware.

1010
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,990
Rubbish.

1011
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,067
We become rubbish.

1012
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,662
I want to help you.

1013
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,941
There must be some way
to break the curse.

1014
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:24,940
Well, there is one.

1015
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,062
It's not for you to worry about, lamb.

1016
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:30,746
We've made our bed and
we must lie in it.

1017
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,179
Drink.

1018
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:33,589
Thank you, Agathe.

1019
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,979
"Love can transpose
to form and dignity.

1020
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,301
"Love looks not with the eyes

1021
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,427
"but with the mind and therefore..."

1022
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:45,743
"And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind."

1023
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:49,742
You know Shakespeare?

1024
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:53,786
I had an expensive education.

1025
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:57,750
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's
my favorite play.

1026
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:01,500
Why is that not a surprise?

1027
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,790
I'm sorry?

1028
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:07,784
Well, all that heartache
and pining and...

1029
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:10,830
So many better things to read.

1030
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,899
Like what?

1031
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:15,428
Well, there are a couple of...

1032
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:18,184
things in here you could start with.

1033
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:23,662
Are you all right?

1034
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:33,181
It's wonderful!

1035
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,986
Yes. I suppose it is.

1036
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:46,300
Well, if you like it so much,
then it's yours.

1037
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:54,270
Have you really read every one
of these books?

1038
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:55,310
What?

1039
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:00,147
Well, not all of them.

1040
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,586
Some of them are in Greek.

1041
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,383
Was that a joke?

1042
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,470
Are you making jokes now?

1043
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,945
Maybe.

1044
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:48,425
"The air is blue and keen and cold...

1045
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,622
"and in a frozen sheath, enrolled.

1046
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,588
"Each branch, each twig...

1047
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:57,625
"each blade of grass seems
clad miraculously with...

1048
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:00,784
"glass."

1049
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:10,310
I feel as if I'm
seeing it for the first time.

1050
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:16,665
Is there any more?

1051
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:20,224
Um...

1052
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:27,343
"But in that solemn silence
is heard the whisper...

1053
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,462
"of every sleeping thing.

1054
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,540
"Look. Look at me.

1055
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,026
"Come wake me up.

1056
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,742
"For still here I be."

1057
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:12,866
There's something sweet and almost kind

1058
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:17,430
But he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined

1059
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:20,867
And now he's dear and so unsure

1060
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:24,262
I wonder why I didn't
see it there before

1061
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:39,465
She glanced this way I thought I saw

1062
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:43,066
And when we touched
She didn't shudder at my paw

1063
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:47,065
No, it can't be I'll just ignore

1064
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,108
But then she's never looked at me

1065
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,670
That way before

1066
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:27,109
New, and a bit alarming

1067
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:34,544
Who'd have ever thought
that this could be

1068
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:43,146
True that he's no Prince Charming

1069
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:49,341
But there's something in him
That I simply didn't see

1070
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,700
- Well, who'd have thought?
- Well, bless my soul!

1071
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,628
- Well, who'd have known?
- Well, who indeed?

1072
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,979
And who'd have guessed

1073
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,789
They'd come together on their own

1074
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,503
It's so peculiar
Wait and see

1075
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:03,390
We'll wait and see
A few days more

1076
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:06,827
There may be something there
That wasn't there before

1077
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:09,228
And here's a thought...

1078
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,188
Perhaps there's something there

1079
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,784
That wasn't there before

1080
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,982
What, Mama?

1081
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:21,987
There may be something there
That wasn't there before

1082
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:25,700
What is it? What's there?

1083
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:28,345
I'll tell you when you're older.

1084
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:31,302
Okay, I'm older!

1085
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:33,428
Chip...

1086
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,582
You are a one.

1087
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,629
What are you reading?

1088
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,790
Nothing.

1089
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,749
Guinevere and Lancelot.

1090
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,589
Well, actually...

1091
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,060
King Arthur and the Round Table.

1092
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,189
Knights and men and swords and things.

1093
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,430
Mmm.

1094
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,025
Still...

1095
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,740
it's a romance.

1096
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:10,065
All right.

1097
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,230
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1098
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:18,628
Well, I never thanked you...

1099
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:21,544
for not leaving me to
be eaten by wolves.

1100
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:27,143
They know how to have a good time.

1101
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:31,384
Yes. But when I enter the room,
laughter dies.

1102
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:33,550
Me too.

1103
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:38,025
The villagers say that
I'm a funny girl...

1104
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,181
but I'm not sure they mean it
as a compliment.

1105
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:41,350
I'm sorry.

1106
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,741
Your village sounds terrible.

1107
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:47,260
Almost as lonely as your castle.

1108
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,950
What do you say we run away?

1109
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:07,261
Another little gift
from the enchantress.

1110
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,749
A book that truly allows you to escape.

1111
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,026
How amazing!

1112
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,630
It was her cruelest trick of all.

1113
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:27,381
It was just another curse.

1114
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:31,623
The outside world has no place
for a creature like me...

1115
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,142
but it can for you.

1116
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:43,347
Think of the one place
you've always wanted to see.

1117
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:49,620
Now find it in your mind's eye.

1118
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,983
Then feel it in your heart.

1119
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,427
Where did you take us?

1120
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:26,145
Paris.

1121
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,981
Oh, I love Paris.

1122
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:32,502
What would you like to see first?

1123
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:33,820
Notre Dame...

1124
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,828
The Champs-ÃlysÃ©es...

1125
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:37,030
No?

1126
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:39,142
Too touristy?

1127
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:43,063
It's so much smaller than I imagined.

1128
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:56,220
This is the Paris of my childhood

1129
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:01,464
These were the borders of my life

1130
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:06,022
In this crumbling, dusty attic

1131
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:10,230
Where an artist loved his wife

1132
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:15,543
Easy to remember

1133
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:19,459
Harder to move on

1134
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,787
Knowing the Paris of my childhood

1135
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,746
Is gone

1136
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,664
What happened to your mother?

1137
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:42,107
It was the one story
Papa could never bring himself to tell.

1138
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:43,949
I knew better than to ask.

1139
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:48,459
Oh. A doctor's mask.

1140
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,184
Plague.

1141
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,742
You must leave now.

1142
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:10,706
Quickly...

1143
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,503
before it takes her too.

1144
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:33,623
I'm sorry I ever
called your father a thief.

1145
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,824
Let's go home.

1146
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:46,142
This is some storm, huh?

1147
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:48,541
At least we're not tied to a tree

1148
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,144
in the middle of nowhere...

1149
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:52,222
surrounded by bloodthirsty wolves.

1150
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:54,188
You know it's not too late.

1151
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:55,539
We could always turn back...

1152
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:58,870
It's just...

1153
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,465
every time I close my eyes...

1154
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,303
I picture Maurice stranded alone.

1155
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:04,665
And then when I open them...

1156
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,510
he's...

1157
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:09,742
Maurice!

1158
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,344
Gaston...

1159
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,820
did you try to kill Maurice?

1160
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,829
Maurice!

1161
01:20:20,990 --> 01:20:22,265
Thank heavens!

1162
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,106
I've spent the last five days...

1163
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:27,182
- trying to find you.
- You tried to kill me.

1164
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:29,023
You left me to the wolves.

1165
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:30,340
Wolves?

1166
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,264
It's one thing to rave
about your delusions.

1167
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,660
It's another to accuse me
of attempted murder.

1168
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,985
Maurice...

1169
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:40,225
do you have any proof
of what you're saying?

1170
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,866
Ask Agathe. She rescued me.

1171
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,390
Agathe!

1172
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,386
You'd hang your accusations
on the testimony...

1173
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:51,864
of a filthy hag?

1174
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:54,067
No offense, Agathe.

1175
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:58,064
Monsieur LeFou.

1176
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:01,230
He was there. He saw it all.

1177
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:02,950
Me?

1178
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,584
You're right.

1179
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:06,548
Don't take my word for it.

1180
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:07,860
LeFou...

1181
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:11,347
my dearest companion...

1182
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,466
did I...

1183
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:16,021
your oldest friend
and most loyal compatriot...

1184
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:19,740
try to kill the father
of the only woman I've ever loved?

1185
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:23,301
Well, it's a complicated question
on a number of accounts...

1186
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,709
But no.

1187
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,146
No, he did not.

1188
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,430
You...

1189
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:39,984
Maurice...

1190
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:42,430
it pains me to say this,

1191
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:45,230
but you've become a danger
to yourself and others.

1192
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,382
No wonder Belle ran away.

1193
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:49,950
You need help, sir.

1194
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,670
A place to heal your troubled mind.

1195
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,741
Everything's going to be fine.

1196
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,150
Just fine.

1197
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:04,389
Well, I saw her in the ballroom...

1198
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,349
and said, "You're making
everything look so beautiful.

1199
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:07,784
"We should have a dance tonight."

1200
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:10,101
I never imagined she'd
actually say yes.

1201
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:11,420
What was I thinking?

1202
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,940
No, Master. It's perfect.

1203
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:16,784
The rose has only four petals left
which means tonight...

1204
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,947
you can tell her how you feel.

1205
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,950
I feel like a fool.

1206
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,782
She will never love me.

1207
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:24,946
Do not be discouraged.

1208
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:27,784
She is the one.

1209
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:30,260
I wish you'd stop saying that!

1210
01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:33,144
There is no "one."

1211
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:34,903
You care for her, don't you?

1212
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:37,824
Well, then, woo her
with beautiful music

1213
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,230
and romantic candlelight.

1214
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:42,508
Yes, and when the
moment's just right...

1215
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,349
Well, how will I know?

1216
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:46,024
You will feel slightly nauseous.

1217
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,580
Don't worry, Master. You'll do fine.

1218
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,901
Just stop being so nervous

1219
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:53,266
and tell Belle how you feel.

1220
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:54,350
Because if you don't...

1221
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,702
I promise you'll be drinking cold tea
for the rest of your days!

1222
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,469
- In the dark.
- Covered in dust.

1223
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:02,349
Dark and very, very dusty.

1224
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,264
Start with the hair.

1225
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,148
Women love nice hair!

1226
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,584
I'll take the fingers and toes.

1227
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:10,708
Chapeau, brush those teeth.
They need it.

1228
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:12,105
Dip, dip.

1229
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,227
Snip, snip.

1230
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:16,669
Polish the nails.

1231
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,662
Shine the horns.

1232
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,184
Eyes closed. Poof, poof.

1233
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,943
And to top it all off...

1234
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:24,824
VoilÃ !

1235
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,864
Okay, I can fix this.

1236
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,905
Oh! Beautiful!

1237
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:41,504
But something is missing.

1238
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,541
Oh, yes.

1239
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:48,548
The finishing touch.

1240
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:57,390
Tale as old as time

1241
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:02,625
True as it can be

1242
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,110
Barely even friends

1243
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:12,101
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

1244
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:18,149
Just a little change

1245
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:22,860
Small to say the least

1246
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:26,264
Both a little scared

1247
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,307
Neither one prepared

1248
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:33,702
Beauty and the Beast

1249
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:47,423
Ever just the same

1250
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:55,303
Ever a surprise

1251
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:00,625
Ever as before

1252
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:03,908
Ever just as sure

1253
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:09,145
As the sun will rise

1254
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:14,746
Tale as old as time

1255
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:21,589
Tune as old as song

1256
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,180
Bittersweet and strange

1257
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:29,508
Finding you can change

1258
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:33,061
Learning you were wrong

1259
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:49,466
Certain as the sun

1260
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,229
Rising in the east

1261
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,224
Tale as old as time

1262
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:01,747
Song as old as rhyme

1263
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:06,302
Beauty and the Beast

1264
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:11,701
Tale as old as time

1265
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:15,068
Song as old as rhyme

1266
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:22,461
Beauty and the Beast

1267
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,704
I haven't danced in years.

1268
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,941
I'd almost forgotten the feeling.

1269
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:57,021
It's foolish, I suppose...

1270
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:00,670
for a creature like me to hope...

1271
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:03,743
that one day he might
earn your affection.

1272
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:06,702
I don't know.

1273
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,144
Really?

1274
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:11,427
You think you could be happy here?

1275
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:19,429
Can anybody be happy
if they aren't free?

1276
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,029
My father taught me to dance.

1277
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:34,503
I used to step on his toes a lot.

1278
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,107
You must miss him.

1279
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:43,705
Very much.

1280
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:52,622
Would you like to see him?

1281
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,308
I'd like to see my father.

1282
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,064
Papa!

1283
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,502
What are they doing to him?

1284
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:13,303
He's in trouble!

1285
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:15,984
Then you must go to him.

1286
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:19,746
What did you say?

1287
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:23,021
You must go to him.

1288
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:26,304
No time to waste.

1289
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:32,626
No...

1290
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,343
you keep it with you.

1291
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:39,389
Then you'll always have a way
to look back on me.

1292
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,144
Thank you.

1293
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,664
Oh...

1294
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,670
Well, Master, I have had my doubts,
but everything is moving like clockwork.

1295
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:37,545
True love really does win the day!

1296
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:41,984
I let her go.

1297
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:43,749
You what?

1298
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:45,902
Master, how could you do that?

1299
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:47,743
I had to.

1300
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:49,421
But why?

1301
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,547
Because he loves her.

1302
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:53,584
Then why are we not human?

1303
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:57,220
Because she doesn't love him.
And now, it's too late.

1304
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:59,427
But she might still come back.

1305
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:00,626
No.

1306
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,904
I set her free.

1307
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:07,462
I'm sorry I couldn't do
the same for all of you.

1308
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:09,269
Now, go.

1309
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:11,626
Our time is almost past.

1310
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,430
Come, my love.

1311
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,263
I was the one who had it all

1312
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:28,183
I was the master of my fate

1313
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:34,507
I never needed anybody in my life

1314
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:38,266
I learned the truth too late

1315
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:42,582
I'll never shake away the pain

1316
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:47,546
I close my eyes but she's still there

1317
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:53,023
I let her steal into
my melancholy heart

1318
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,862
It's more than I can bear

1319
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:05,229
Now I know she'll never leave me

1320
01:32:05,390 --> 01:32:09,782
Even as she runs away

1321
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:14,547
She will still torment me
Calm me, hurt me

1322
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:17,987
Move me, come what may

1323
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:23,910
Wasting in my lonely tower

1324
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,825
Waiting by an open door

1325
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,348
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1326
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:38,190
And be with me for evermore

1327
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:44,382
I rage against the trials of love

1328
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:48,583
I curse the fading of the light

1329
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:54,025
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

1330
01:32:54,630 --> 01:33:00,706
She's never out of sight

1331
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:05,268
Now I know she'll never leave me

1332
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:11,026
Even as she fades from view

1333
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,942
She will still inspire me

1334
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:18,742
Be a part of everything I do

1335
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:23,704
Wasting in my lonely tower

1336
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:27,787
Waiting by an open door

1337
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:32,547
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1338
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:36,668
And as the long, long nights begin

1339
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:41,228
I'll think of all that might have been

1340
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:49,102
Waiting here for evermore

1341
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,626
This man is weak.

1342
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:11,710
Please!

1343
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,789
He needs a hospital...

1344
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:15,099
not an asylum!

1345
01:34:18,630 --> 01:34:21,509
Have you ever seen the inside
of a mad house, Maurice?

1346
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,582
You wouldn't last a week.

1347
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:25,869
Just give me your daughter's hand,
and I'll set you free.

1348
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,099
Never.

1349
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,749
Take him away!

1350
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:41,030
Stop!

1351
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:54,710
Papa.

1352
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:56,429
Oh, Belle. I thought I'd lost you.

1353
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,786
Let him out! He's hurt.

1354
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:00,145
We can't do that, miss.

1355
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:01,710
But we'll take very good care of him.

1356
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:03,702
My father's not crazy.

1357
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:05,503
Gaston, tell him!

1358
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:07,388
You know how loyal I
am to your family...

1359
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,270
but your father's been making
some unbelievable claims.

1360
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:12,069
It's true, Belle.

1361
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:14,665
He's been raving about a beast...

1362
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,750
in a castle!

1363
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:18,589
I've just come from the castle
and there is a beast!

1364
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,782
You'd say anything to set him free.
Your word is hardly proof.

1365
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:23,469
You want proof?

1366
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:27,103
Show me the Beast!

1367
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:38,390
There's your proof.

1368
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:41,020
This is sorcery!

1369
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:45,990
Look at this beast!

1370
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:47,464
Look at his fangs!

1371
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:49,739
His claws!

1372
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:52,180
No. Don't be afraid.

1373
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:54,581
He's gentle and kind.

1374
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:59,424
The monster has her under his spell.

1375
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,905
If I didn't know better,

1376
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:03,505
I'd say she even cared for him!

1377
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:05,702
He's not a monster, Gaston.

1378
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:06,986
You are!

1379
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,350
The Beast wouldn't hurt anyone.

1380
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:12,308
I've heard of the effects
of dark magic...

1381
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:15,309
but I've never before seen it
with my own eyes!

1382
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:18,343
This is a threat to our very existence!

1383
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:21,866
We can't have her
running off to warn the beast.

1384
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,145
Lock her up too.

1385
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:24,750
- No!
- Come here!

1386
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:26,389
Shut up!

1387
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,950
You won't get away with this, Gaston!

1388
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:30,346
Oh, Belle!

1389
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:33,022
Gaston, with all due respect...

1390
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:34,823
Do you want to be next?

1391
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:37,179
Fetch my horse.

1392
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,630
Stand guard!

1393
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,860
Don't let them escape.

1394
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:42,465
This creature will curse us all
if we don't stop him.

1395
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:46,909
Well, I say, we kill the beast!

1396
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:48,060
Kill the beast!

1397
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:52,184
We're not safe until he's dead

1398
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:54,029
He'll come stalking us at night

1399
01:36:54,190 --> 01:36:57,342
Set to sacrifice our children
To his monstrous appetite

1400
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:59,149
He'll wreak havoc on our village

1401
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,664
If we let him wander free

1402
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:04,227
So it's time to take some action, boys

1403
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:09,784
It's time to follow me

1404
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:14,069
Through the mist, through the wood
Through the darkness and the shadows

1405
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:17,381
It's a nightmare
But it's one exciting ride

1406
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:20,981
Say a prayer, then we're there
At the drawbridge of a castle

1407
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:24,541
And there's something
truly terrible inside

1408
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:27,344
It's a beast
He's got fangs, razor sharp ones

1409
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,702
Massive paws, killer
claws for the feast

1410
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:32,469
Hear him roar, see him foam

1411
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:36,180
But we're not coming home
'Til he's dead

1412
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,386
Good and dead

1413
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:38,864
Kill the beast!

1414
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:42,869
Light your torch, mount your horse

1415
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:44,589
Screw your courage to
the sticking place

1416
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:48,027
We're counting on
Gaston to lead the way

1417
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:51,182
Call it war, call it threat
You can bet they all will follow

1418
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:54,388
For in times like this
They'll do just as I say

1419
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:57,782
There's a beast running wild
There's no question

1420
01:37:57,950 --> 01:38:01,068
But I fear the wrong monster's released

1421
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:04,746
Sally forth, tally ho
Grab your sword, grab your bow

1422
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:09,109
Praise the Lord, and here we go

1423
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,063
Show me the castle.

1424
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:18,269
At least he has finally
learned to love.

1425
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:21,389
A lot of good that does us
if she doesn't love him in return.

1426
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:25,829
No. This is the first time
I've had any real hope she would.

1427
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:27,743
Did you hear that, Mama?

1428
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:29,310
Is it her? Is she coming back?

1429
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:30,580
Could it be?

1430
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,264
I told you!

1431
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:33,625
SacrÃ© bleu!

1432
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,070
Invaders!

1433
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,379
Ruffians!

1434
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:38,382
Well, there you go.

1435
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:40,621
So much for true love.

1436
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,429
Man the barricades...

1437
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:45,424
and hold fast!

1438
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:46,785
Move aside!

1439
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,982
Hearts ablaze, banners high
We go marching into battle

1440
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:52,944
Unafraid, although
the danger's just increased

1441
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:57,948
Raise the flag, sing the song
Here we come, we're fifty strong

1442
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:01,103
And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong

1443
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,465
Let's kill the beast!

1444
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,350
We need help.

1445
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:13,220
- I have to warn the Beast.
- Warn him?

1446
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:15,302
How did you get away from him?

1447
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:18,622
He let me go, Papa.

1448
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:20,943
He sent me back to you.

1449
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:23,022
I don't understand.

1450
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:30,630
Where did you...

1451
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:33,146
He took me there.

1452
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:38,945
I know what happened to Maman.

1453
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:41,745
Then you know
why I had to leave her there.

1454
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:42,946
I had to protect you.

1455
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:46,269
I've always tried to protect
my little girl.

1456
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:47,750
Probably too much.

1457
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:50,462
I understand.

1458
01:39:58,190 --> 01:39:59,624
Will you help me now?

1459
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,662
It's dangerous.

1460
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:02,980
Yes.

1461
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:04,864
Yes, it is.

1462
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:10,262
I could try to pick the lock.

1463
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:12,066
After all...

1464
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:16,104
it's only gears and springs.

1465
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:20,588
But I would need...

1466
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:23,270
something long and sharp.

1467
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:25,540
Like that.

1468
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:27,190
Perfect.

1469
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:33,064
Oh, excuse me, Master.

1470
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,903
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

1471
01:40:35,110 --> 01:40:36,624
She's not coming back.

1472
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:38,746
No.

1473
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:40,907
They're breaking down the doors!

1474
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:43,627
Doesn't matter now.

1475
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,305
Just let them come.

1476
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:49,110
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

1477
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,505
This isn't working!

1478
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:51,826
I know what to do.

1479
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:54,226
Kill the beast! Kill the beast!

1480
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:56,343
Kill the beast!

1481
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:06,101
Are you not the least bit concerned...

1482
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:08,068
that this castle might be haunted?

1483
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:11,906
Don't lose your nerve, LeFou.

1484
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,266
Where are we?

1485
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:18,984
This place seems familiar.

1486
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:21,142
Like I've been here before.

1487
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:25,265
Oh, hello, there.

1488
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:28,749
You must be the talking tea cup.

1489
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:30,506
And you must be...

1490
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:31,859
his grandmother.

1491
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:33,822
Grandmother?

1492
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:36,107
Attack!

1493
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,509
Oh, hello!

1494
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:54,225
Gaston!

1495
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:59,265
Gaston.

1496
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:00,460
Help.

1497
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:01,984
Sorry, old friend.

1498
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:04,343
It's hero time.

1499
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:05,865
Ooh, ouch!

1500
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:25,466
Hello.

1501
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:28,830
Oh, uh... I believe this is yours.

1502
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:36,390
She's very headstrong.

1503
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:39,545
Do you have children?

1504
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:46,188
No one to protect you now, huh?

1505
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:57,540
One, two, three, four...

1506
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:59,861
five, six, seven, eight...

1507
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:01,066
Good show, Chip, my boy.

1508
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:03,703
Excellent!

1509
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:05,901
The infantry's arrived.

1510
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:08,587
Now, go and teach them a lesson. Go.

1511
01:43:09,710 --> 01:43:13,499
Yes, those are called books,
you third rate musketeers.

1512
01:43:16,030 --> 01:43:17,544
Oh! I'm off.

1513
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:26,061
Just a clock.

1514
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:28,427
Come here...

1515
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:29,944
little boys.

1516
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:32,427
I spin you this way. I put it on.

1517
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:36,709
Yes, pretty little boys. Yes!

1518
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:39,263
Beautiful!

1519
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:41,422
Go, be free!

1520
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:42,944
Be free. Be free!

1521
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:57,509
How do you like your tea?

1522
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,104
Piping hot?

1523
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,148
Or boiling?

1524
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:02,626
Oh!

1525
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:04,390
Mr. Potts!

1526
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:08,590
Mama!

1527
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:12,384
Thank you!

1528
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:16,185
Take that!

1529
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:18,864
Nicely handled!

1530
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:20,470
Well, I used to be on Gaston's side...

1531
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:22,263
but we are so in a bad place right now.

1532
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:24,786
- You're too good for him, anyway.
- Yeah.

1533
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:26,190
Should we get back to it, then?

1534
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:31,304
Such sweet music.

1535
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:34,309
- Stand back.
- Silence that harpsichord!

1536
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:36,502
- What? Uh-oh!
- Maestro!

1537
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:37,905
Darling! At last!

1538
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:39,987
I'm coming, my love.

1539
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:42,068
This is it!

1540
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:45,262
The fat lady is singing.

1541
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:51,345
Bravissima!

1542
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:58,907
Watch your toes!

1543
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:04,660
That's it! Go! Go!

1544
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:07,226
Bon voyage.

1545
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:13,629
Safe trip home.

1546
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:15,349
And stay out!

1547
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:37,070
Hello, beast.

1548
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:41,943
I'm Gaston.

1549
01:45:42,710 --> 01:45:44,429
Belle sent me.

1550
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:49,420
Are you in love with her?

1551
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:54,064
Did you honestly think she'd want you?

1552
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,100
Belle!

1553
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:14,548
Where is he?

1554
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:16,110
When we return to the village...

1555
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:17,823
you will marry me.

1556
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:19,709
And that beast's head...

1557
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,747
- will hang on our wall.
- Never!

1558
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,384
I'm coming for you, beast.

1559
01:47:00,430 --> 01:47:02,865
- No!
- Belle?

1560
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:08,386
Belle!

1561
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:10,706
You came back!

1562
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:13,704
- I tried to stop them!
- Stay there!

1563
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,310
I'm coming.

1564
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:43,985
Gaston!

1565
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:45,226
No!

1566
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,022
Don't let me go.

1567
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:02,670
Please.

1568
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:04,583
I'll do anything.

1569
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:06,064
Don't hurt me, beast.

1570
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:17,069
I am not...

1571
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:18,664
a beast.

1572
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:26,784
Go!

1573
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:29,822
Get out!

1574
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:32,020
Don't!

1575
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:33,430
It's too far!

1576
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:50,826
Please!

1577
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:55,345
Come on.

1578
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:26,304
You came back.

1579
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:29,467
Of course I came back.

1580
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:31,030
I'll never leave you again.

1581
01:49:31,790 --> 01:49:33,986
I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.

1582
01:49:34,190 --> 01:49:35,590
We're together now.

1583
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:37,989
It's gonna be fine.

1584
01:49:38,110 --> 01:49:40,420
At least I got to see you.

1585
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:42,821
One last time.

1586
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:49,384
No!

1587
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,830
Please, no.

1588
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:55,585
Come back.

1589
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:04,709
We did it, Plumette!

1590
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:07,101
Victory is ours.

1591
01:50:07,550 --> 01:50:09,781
- Oh...
- Plumette?

1592
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:11,950
Plumette?

1593
01:50:12,710 --> 01:50:15,270
Oh, my darling, Plumette.

1594
01:50:16,350 --> 01:50:17,704
Oh, no.

1595
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:21,389
Maestro, you were so brave.

1596
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:24,147
Goodbye, my love.

1597
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:26,790
Amore.

1598
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:29,989
No!
Don't leave me!

1599
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,465
Chip!

1600
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,099
Chip!

1601
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:54,790
Have you seen Chip? He ran off.

1602
01:50:57,830 --> 01:51:00,026
Where is my little boy?

1603
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:05,948
- Mama!
- Oh, no!

1604
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:07,544
Mom!

1605
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:25,146
Lumiere...

1606
01:51:25,390 --> 01:51:26,904
I can't...

1607
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:28,030
speak.

1608
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:29,703
It's all right, Cogsworth.

1609
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:30,830
I can't...

1610
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:32,540
Lumiere...

1611
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:34,066
my friend.

1612
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:36,421
It was an honor to serve...

1613
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:37,660
with you.

1614
01:51:40,430 --> 01:51:42,945
The honor was mine.

1615
01:52:10,590 --> 01:52:12,070
Come back.

1616
01:52:12,270 --> 01:52:13,784
Please don't leave me.

1617
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:19,141
I love you.

1618
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:36,981
Oh. Maestro!

1619
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:43,464
Madame!

1620
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:45,390
Maestro!

1621
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:03,626
Ooh.

1622
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:06,539
- Lumiere!
- Ah?

1623
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:09,180
Cogsworth, we beat the clock!

1624
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:10,466
Mon ami!

1625
01:55:13,710 --> 01:55:14,710
Plumette!

1626
01:55:16,190 --> 01:55:18,182
Plumette!

1627
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:21,870
Oh. Mon amour.

1628
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:25,790
Oh.

1629
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:32,903
Oh. Oh.

1630
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:46,502
Chip! Look at you!

1631
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:48,750
You're a little boy again!

1632
01:55:48,910 --> 01:55:51,027
What did I tell you, darling?

1633
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:52,903
You smell so good!

1634
01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:01,860
Froufrou, finalmente!

1635
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,580
Darling?

1636
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:06,709
Oh! Mr. Potts!

1637
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:08,827
Beatrice! I remember!

1638
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:10,219
I do!

1639
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:17,466
Henry?

1640
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:18,946
Henry!

1641
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:20,669
Oh! Oh, dear.

1642
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:23,386
Oh!

1643
01:56:23,870 --> 01:56:25,589
I've been so lonely.

1644
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:27,469
Turn back into a clock.

1645
01:56:27,670 --> 01:56:29,184
Turn back into a clock.

1646
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:32,541
Lumiere, look!

1647
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:36,504
Oh, my Prince!

1648
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,869
Hello, old friend.

1649
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,179
Oh! It's so good to see you.

1650
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:43,943
You saved our lives, mademoiselle.

1651
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:45,584
Belle! It's me!

1652
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:47,264
It's Chip!

1653
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:55,742
Tale as old as time

1654
01:56:55,910 --> 01:57:00,029
Tune as old as song

1655
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:04,821
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change

1656
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:10,463
Learning you were wrong

1657
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:31,661
Winter turns to spring

1658
01:57:34,150 --> 01:57:36,346
Famine turns to feast

1659
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:39,901
Nature points the way

1660
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:42,983
Nothing left to say

1661
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:49,066
Beauty and the Beast

1662
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:54,066
What? What is it?

1663
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:56,426
How would you feel
about growing a beard?

1664
01:57:58,456 --> 01:58:03,456
<font color=#ff0000>Psagmeno.com</font>

1665
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:07,500
Certain as the sun

1666
01:58:08,990 --> 01:58:11,789
Rising in the east

1667
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:14,510
Tale as old as time

1668
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:17,305
Song as old as rhyme

1669
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:20,628
Beauty and the Beast

1670
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:26,702
Tale as old as time

1671
01:58:26,830 --> 01:58:30,107
Song as old as rhyme

1672
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:34,941
Beauty and the Beast

1673
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:20,430
How does a moment last forever?

1674
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:24,300
How can a story never die?

1675
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:28,589
It is love we must hold on to

1676
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:32,830
Never easy but we try

1677
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:37,306
Sometimes our happiness is captured

1678
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:42,463
Somehow a time and place stand still

1679
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:46,419
Love lives on inside our hearts

1680
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:50,186
And always will

1681
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:55,344
Minutes turn to hours

1682
01:59:55,510 --> 02:00:00,426
Days to years then gone

1683
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:04,425
But when all else has been forgotten

1684
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:10,704
Still our song lives on

1685
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:16,589
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect

1686
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:20,386
Maybe some memories not so sweet

1687
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:24,789
But we have to know some bad times

1688
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:29,507
Or our lives are incomplete

1689
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:33,186
Then when shadows overtake us

1690
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:37,870
Just when we feel all hope is gone

1691
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:42,149
We'll hear our song and know once more

1692
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:46,350
Our love lives on

1693
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:58,108
Oh, oh

1694
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:12,904
How does a moment last forever?

1695
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:16,381
How does our happiness endure?

1696
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:20,146
Through the darkest of our troubles

1697
02:01:20,310 --> 02:01:25,260
Love is beauty, love is pure

1698
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:29,265
Love pays no mind to desolation

1699
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:33,265
It flows like a river through the soul

1700
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:37,470
Protects, proceeds, and perseveres

1701
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:42,022
And makes us whole

1702
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:46,110
Minutes turn to hours

1703
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:50,503
Days to years then gone

1704
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:56,947
But when all else has been forgotten

1705
02:01:57,550 --> 02:02:04,104
Still our song lives on

1706
02:02:06,070 --> 02:02:10,349
How does a moment last forever

1707
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:18,188
When our song lives on

1708
02:02:45,550 --> 02:02:48,190
Ah

1709
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:58,303
Tale as old as time

1710
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:04,102
True as it can be

1711
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:08,629
Barely even friends

1712
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:15,788
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

1713
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:22,226
Just a little change

1714
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:26,342
Small to say the least

1715
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:29,230
Both a little scared

1716
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:32,224
Neither one prepared

1717
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:37,101
Beauty and the Beast

1718
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:43,544
Ever just the same

1719
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:49,902
Ever a surprise

1720
02:03:50,070 --> 02:03:52,505
Ever as before

1721
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:55,788
And ever just as sure

1722
02:03:55,950 --> 02:04:00,388
As the sun will rise

1723
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:03,907
Oh

1724
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:10,584
Hey

1725
02:04:13,630 --> 02:04:15,940
Ah

1726
02:04:16,230 --> 02:04:21,066
Ooh

1727
02:04:23,590 --> 02:04:25,229
Uh-huh

1728
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:29,623
Ever just the same

1729
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:35,422
And ever a surprise

1730
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:39,909
Ever as before

1731
02:04:40,070 --> 02:04:42,904
And ever just as sure

1732
02:04:43,070 --> 02:04:47,508
As the sun will rise

1733
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:51,340
Oh, oh, oh

1734
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:56,300
Tale as old as time

1735
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:02,101
Tune as old as song

1736
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,829
Oh

1737
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:07,424
Bittersweet and strange

1738
02:05:07,590 --> 02:05:10,424
Finding you can change

1739
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:13,304
Learning you were wrong

1740
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:19,224
Certain as the sun

1741
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:22,309
Certain as the sun

1742
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:25,030
Rising in the east

1743
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:27,910
Tale as old as time

1744
02:05:28,070 --> 02:05:31,029
Song as old as rhyme

1745
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:35,543
Beauty and the Beast

1746
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:39,790
Tale as old as time

1747
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:42,983
Song as old as rhyme

1748
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:50,148
Beauty and the Beast

1749
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,340
I was the one who had it all

1750
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:27,504
I was the master of my fate

1751
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:32,781
I never needed anybody in my life

1752
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:37,502
I learned the truth too late

1753
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:42,062
I'll never shake away the pain

1754
02:06:42,590 --> 02:06:47,142
I close my eyes but she's still there

1755
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:51,981
I let her steal into
my melancholy heart

1756
02:06:52,190 --> 02:06:57,743
It's more than I can bear

1757
02:06:58,190 --> 02:07:03,470
Now I know she'll never leave me

1758
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:08,102
Even as she runs away

1759
02:07:08,270 --> 02:07:12,867
She will still torment
me Calm me, hurt me

1760
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:17,024
Move me, come what may

1761
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:21,948
Wasting in my lonely tower

1762
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:26,980
Waiting by an open door

1763
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:31,470
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1764
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:37,744
And be with me for evermore

1765
02:07:39,630 --> 02:07:43,465
I rage against the trials of love

1766
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:48,064
I curse the fading of the light

1767
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:52,743
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

1768
02:07:53,190 --> 02:07:58,948
She's never out of sight

1769
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:03,787
Now I know she'll never leave me

1770
02:08:04,190 --> 02:08:08,503
Even as she fades from view

1771
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:11,185
She will still inspire me

1772
02:08:11,390 --> 02:08:16,988
Be a part of everything I do

1773
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:22,149
Wasting in my lonely tower

1774
02:08:22,590 --> 02:08:27,267
Waiting by an open door

1775
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:31,106
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1776
02:08:31,910 --> 02:08:35,540
And as the long, long nights begin

1777
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:40,065
I'll think of all that might have been

1778
02:08:40,230 --> 02:08:47,228
Waiting here for evermore
