1
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,980
Deep in the heart of Africa
is a place no man has ever entered.

2
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,070
A place that belongs to the lion,
the elephant and the ape.

3
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,730
A place known as the bukuvu.

4
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,650
Travellers flying overhead
can only glimpse at its many marvels:

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,070
Its sparkling rivers...

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,370
Its lush veldts,
its billowy cloud formations...

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,460
And... its hidden mountains.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,710
- Never fear, my friends.
- George!
- George!

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,750
- All was not lost.
- George!

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,010
Scraped and boo-booed,
they searched high and low...

11
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,010
But they never recovered
their most precious cargo.

12
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,980
George, George
George of the jungle

13
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,190
strong as he can be

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,690
watch out for that tree

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,860
George, George
George of the jungle

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,370
lives a life that's free

17
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,580
watch out for that tree

18
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,870
when he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
with help from his friend
an ape named ape

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,380
and his elephant shep
can fetch a log

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,380
he's man's best friend
he's George's dog

22
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,220
he's George, George
George of the jungle

23
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,300
strong as he can be

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,810
watch out for that tree

25
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,850
hear him holler
swing and sing

26
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,400
all the animals come
to the jungle king

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,360
George, George
George of the jungle

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,520
George, George
George of the jungle

29
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,940
so grab a vine
and swing in time

30
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,780
if you smack a tree
just pay no mind

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,660
like George, George
George of the jungle

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,830
strong as he can be

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,210
watch out for that tree

34
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,790
watch out for that--
Bang! Ooh! Tree

35
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,630
George, George
George of the jungle

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,800
watch out for that tree

37
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,180
twenty-five years later,
the bouncing baby boy...

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,100
Has grown into
a swinging jungle king.

39
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,270
He is swift. He is strong.

40
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,690
He is sure. He is smart.

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,690
He is unconscious.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,070
Meanwhile, 43 vines away...

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,660
George's kingdom was being threatened
by a terrifying intruder.

44
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,660
Hi, everybody. Me again.

45
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,080
Third day in mbwebwe.
Look at this incredible--

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,250
- Banyan tree.
- Banyan tree. And look what's in it.

47
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,170
Could you die?

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,340
And over here...

49
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,720
Is the outhouse, which you
don't want to see, believe me.

50
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,720
By the way, Betsy, thank you so
much for those moist towelettes.

51
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,140
They've been a lifesaver.

52
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,860
And these are the wonderful porters.
Wave, guys.

53
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,320
And this is our guide, mr kwame.

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,610
Without him, we would be lost.
Hi.

55
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,450
This is great.

56
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,700
- And this is Lyle.
- Hello, bujumburans.

57
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,830
- What are you doing here?
- What kind of greeting is that
to give your fiance?

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,210
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Yeah, of course I am.

59
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,760
The jungle loves you.
You're beautiful.

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,510
- How did you find me?
- Well, I just hired the two
best trackers in the business.

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,230
I'm chafing, Max.
Yeah, I'm chafing big time.

62
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,230
Didn't I tell you not to wear 20 pounds
of black leather in the jungle?

63
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,400
Didn't I tell ya?

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,280
Cotton, I said. Cotton breathes.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,150
Take my things to the lady's tent
and shake a leg.

66
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,620
Later that night, Lyle van de groot
lost no time in making arrangements...

67
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,330
- To whisk his wayward fiancee back home.
- All right, I'll take it, I'll take it.

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,920
Nairobi Hilton.
They can airlift us there in two hours.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
Pillows, okay?

70
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,220
Wait a second. I'm losing you.
Bad reception here.

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,840
Okay, I've got you back.
No, wait! I'm losing you!

72
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,680
My batteries are dead!
No! Doody!

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,720
I don't want to go anyway, Lyle.
Tomorrow we're gonna...

74
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,980
Climb the Mountain where the big apes
are. Don't you wanna see them?

75
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,730
Only if they can shake a good gin
Martini without bruising it. Hiyo!

76
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,860
Me and Thor here would be happy
to help you and the lady up
the Mountain, mr van de groot.

77
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,320
- Yeah.
- With mr kwame leading the way,
of course.

78
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,910
If you don't mind me saying so,
the apes...

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,660
Are supposed to be a fascinating sight,
especially that white ape.

80
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,500
White ape? What's that?

81
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,760
Ask mr kwame.
I bet he can tell you.

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,840
- It is only a native legend.
- Could you please tell us?

83
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,890
The people say he is
over seven feet tall...

84
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,350
With the strength of a lion.

85
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,980
When the moon is full
and the air is sweet...

86
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,270
He wanders alone
through the jungle...

87
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,030
Piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call.

88
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,110
Now, some say he is
thirsty for blood.

89
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for...

90
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,750
But will never find.

91
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,380
By day, he rules the entire bukuvu
from the top of the Mountain.

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,540
But by night--

93
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,050
He and bigfoot run the candy counter
at the bukuvu cineplex.

94
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,880
Now playing on all 14 screens:

95
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,180
Planet of the apes.

96
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,520
Bigfoot? Max, that'd be worth
a lot more than any white--

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,230
- Ursula, what are we doing here?
- Lyle, I came all this way--

98
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,530
Okay, okay.
The things I do for you.

99
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,650
Looks like we're on, fellows.

100
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,110
As the sun rose
over ape Mountain...

101
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,410
Its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent
message to George by bongo-gram...

102
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,710
Warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot.

103
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,870
Ooh. Lyle, listen.
What was that?

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Could be the mating call
of the white ape.

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,380
White ape.
Sounds like a drink.

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,630
Yes, bartender. I'll have
two black Russians and a white ape.

107
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,930
A drink the venal van de groot
would be begging to imbibe...

108
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,930
If he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment...

109
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,180
Flying through the foliage,
surveying the scenery, cruising in...

110
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,610
For a closer look and swinging on
through the trees with effortless ease.

111
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,780
And so, onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged...

112
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,740
On feverish footsies
over perilous paths.

113
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,080
When they finally beheld the mighty
ape Mountain, they reacted with awe.

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,710
- Aww.
- I said "awe." A-w-e.

115
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,340
- Ooh!
- That's better.

116
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,550
Single file on the bridge.
Step very cautiously.

117
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,850
It is full of rotten planks.
One false move, you could fall over.

118
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,850
Then you will have
a very long time to wave goodbye.

119
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,690
Don't you worry, peanut.
I was on a bridge like this in Maui.

120
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,940
It was steady as a rock.
See?

121
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,570
Hey! S-stop! Stop that!
Stop that! What th--

122
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,150
Yee-haw!

123
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,280
- I got you.
- No!

124
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,580
Don't worry.
Nobody dies in this story.

125
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,540
They just get
really big boo-boos.

126
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,080
What did I tell you?

127
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,550
You know, they shouldn't let
inexperienced guides
like that on these treks.

128
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,810
Did you see the look
that guy just gave me?

129
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,640
Probably saying I'm the biggest jerk
they've ever seen in their lives.

130
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,100
Probably trying to think
of something evil to do to me.

131
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,200
If they turn on us,
we're never gonna get home.

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,740
It's up to me to make the peace.
I'm going in.

133
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,660
Gentlemen. Cigar, cigarette?

134
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,960
Okay, gifts from America.

135
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,960
- Hey, hey.
- I give you a cigar,
you give me some of your lands.

136
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,920
All right.
A first contact has been made.

137
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,140
Ready, aim--

138
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,100
There you go, my man.

139
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,440
You like magic fire? Do ya?

140
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,270
Well, get a load of this.

141
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,570
There you go. Magic picture.

142
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,030
Yet another gift from America.
Here you go.

143
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,740
You're welcome.

144
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,460
Thirty-five millimetre.

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,260
Translation, please.

146
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,470
He says that he likes
your magic pictures...

147
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,310
But he prefers the resolution of
the Leica 35 millimetre transparencies.

148
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,810
He also says your lens is dirty, but he
has the equipment to clean it for you.

149
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,070
Well, tell him to clean this
while he's at it.

150
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,030
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

151
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,120
Find you an ape, so we
can get the heck outta here.

152
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,080
Lyle, we can't go into the jungle alone.
We could get lost out here.

153
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,700
It's my job to get you
what you want.

154
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,290
You want a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles...

155
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,040
You will get a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles.

156
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,420
You want a white ape,
I'll get you a white ape.

157
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,050
Here, monkey, monkey, monkey.

158
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,140
Here, gorilla, gorilla.
Come on.

159
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,980
- Don't move.
- You mean I actually found one?
It worked?

160
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,790
- God, that scared me.
- Scared me, too.

161
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,250
I'm gonna go get help.
You wait here.

162
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,980
No.

163
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,730
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,210
When lion brush last?

165
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,840
Don't tickle.
Don't ti-- no--

166
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,530
Rubber tree always good for clothesline.
Upsy, kitty.

167
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,580
George not even trying hard.

168
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,090
Flying pile driver.
Havin' some fun now.

169
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,850
Bad kitty!

170
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,370
- That close one?
- Watch out for that tree!

171
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,790
Oops.

172
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,050
Funny-looking fella.

173
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,560
White ape.

174
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,520
Y-- y-- u-Ursula!
Ursu-- wha--

175
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,450
Ursula, I found your scrunchie.

176
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,190
Go away!

177
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,900
It was horrible.

178
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,570
It was-- 400-pound
white ape man.

179
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,370
The white ape
has my girlfriend.

180
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,000
I held him off as long as I could.
Blood everywhere.

181
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,880
The white ape-- my girlfriend.

182
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,050
He-- he weighs 400 pounds.

183
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,630
The white ape got my girlfriend!
The white ape got--

184
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,800
Help! Help! Man needs help!

185
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,860
After a night
of feverish fantasies...

186
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,200
The perfectly permed heiress,
Ursula stanhope...

187
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,160
Awoke to the melodious music of the
bukuvu bird life, and found herself...

188
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,790
Venturing forth in search
of that defender of the innocent...

189
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,540
Protector of the weak,
and all-around good guy...

190
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,880
George of the jungle.

191
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,630
But that's not
who she saw first.

192
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,640
What!

193
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,890
Get away! Get away!
Get away!

194
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,620
- Hello. Oop!
- Dear.

195
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,960
Feeling better, fella?

196
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,840
Okay. It's that dream, then.

197
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,800
I'm still having that
psycho dream. Hello.

198
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,550
No, no! Don't worry! Ape friend.

199
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,720
- Ape make your breakfast.
- What does it want?
What does it want?

200
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,930
"It" wants its physician's
desk reference, if you don't mind.

201
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,100
Unless you'd rather die
of dengue fever, of course.

202
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,400
That is very funny!

203
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,690
I thought I heard
the monkey talk.

204
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,950
But that is totally
understandable, right?

205
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,700
I mean, why wouldn't
an ape read textbooks?

206
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,330
And why wouldn't I find
myself in a tree house...

207
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,830
With room service and a Tarzan wannabe,
wearing a, um, um--

208
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,000
- What do you call that thing?
- Butt flap.

209
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,500
Right.

210
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,800
Ooh!

211
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,600
Bit of a shock, I suppose. Yes.

212
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,390
Fever.

213
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,900
Cold compress. Dab her lightly, George.
"Talking monkey."

214
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,610
That's the ticket. Good.

215
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,370
Somethin' funny
about this fella.

216
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,450
She's not a "fella," George. She's
a woman, the female of your species.

217
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,080
You mean ape and George
not brothers?

218
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,420
Well, in a sense,
we are related.

219
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,050
After all, we're both members
of the primate family.

220
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,090
Primate family. Brothers.

221
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,430
I suppose one might claim
that there would--

222
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,510
Mommy, make that monkey
stop talking.

223
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,350
Perhaps I should refrain from speaking
around her, as it seems to upset her.

224
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,120
- What your name?
- Ursula.

225
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,340
Ursula stanhope.

226
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,050
- Who are you?
- George.

227
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,760
George primate.

228
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,470
And that brother ape.
Ape primate.

229
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,930
Um--

230
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,940
Okay, I'm gonna
pass out again now.

231
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,150
Bye.

232
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,820
It's a sissy white ape.
I would've choked the life out of him...

233
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,070
Except that he had two of his
lion buddies jump me from behind.

234
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,910
So in this version,
there are two lions with the white ape?

235
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,490
A minute ago,
there was only one.

236
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,290
H-hey, the important thing,
kwame, is that I was outnumbered.

237
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,920
Absolutely.

238
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,730
Ursula!

239
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,030
Hi. When I woke up this morning,
I remembered about that lion...

240
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,620
And I know you
saved me yesterday.

241
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,120
And I just wanted to say thank you.

242
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,500
Ooh!

243
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,340
Now that I'm feeling better,
I realize the others must think
I'm cat food by now.

244
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,130
And I don't want my fian--
This guy that I was with-- to worry.

245
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,470
So, so I should probably go
and look for them...

246
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,430
And I was wondering
if you could help me.

247
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,600
- Ursula want to go already?

248
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,360
Okay, George help.
Get trusty doggy.

249
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
You have a dog.
That's great.

250
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,940
Doggy will help find friends.
George call shep.

251
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,280
Shep! Here, boy!

252
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,820
Come on! Here, boy.

253
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,240
Shep!

254
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,250
Here comes shep.
Come on, shep! Come on, boy!

255
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,750
That a boy! Want to play?
Come on! Come on! Come on!

256
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,670
Good boy.

257
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,840
Come on, boy! Come on!
Good boy, shep! Come on!

258
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

259
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,720
Sit. Sit.

260
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,900
Good boy!
Good obedience training.

261
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,520
- George trained from pup.
- That's your dog?

262
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,150
This shep, George's big,
grey, peanut-lovin' poochie.

263
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,360
Good boy, shep! Good boy.

264
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,030
Good boy, shep. Good boy.

265
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,290
That's a good boy. Wanna shake?

266
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,290
- Good doggy. Be nice.
- Shep.

267
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,710
Shake? George. George.

268
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,800
George!

269
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,600
- See? Shep shake.
- George.

270
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,770
He's a big poochie, all right.

271
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,940
Does he fetch?

272
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,280
Here, boy. Come on, boy.
Want a stick?

273
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,780
Want a stick?
Where's the stick?

274
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,080
Where's the stick, shep?

275
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,160
Here it is.
Here, boy. Fetch!

276
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,880
Come on, boy!
Run, run! Run, boy!

277
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,800
Atta boy! Good boy.
Go on, boy! Go get it!

278
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,640
Where'd he go?

279
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,390
- Wow!
- No, not in the roses!

280
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,730
Ungawa, shep!

281
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,860
And so, with the help
of the jungle king's big, grey...

282
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,030
Peanut-loving poochie,
George and Ursula set out...

283
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,030
On a desperate search to find
her fianc-- that guy she was with--

284
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,910
Lyle! Lyle!

285
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,920
- Ursula! Ursula!
- While he desperately
searched for her.

286
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,130
But by the end of the afternoon
her desperation had dimmed...

287
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,380
That was fantastic!

288
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,970
And she had given up
all hope of everything...

289
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,810
Except enjoying the jungle king's
company from her precarious perch
atop his faithful doggy.

290
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,140
- So, where are we going now?
- To find tookie-tookie bird
for jungle news.

291
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,400
Tookie-tookie bird.
I love that.

292
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,270
Later they rested,
while the tired tusker teethed on a--

293
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,650
Wait a second.
The dog bone is too much. Lose it.

294
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,820
That's better.

295
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,450
Bongo-gram.
What could it mean?

296
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,540
Tookie-tookie!

297
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,510
Tookie say
little monkey in trouble.

298
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,590
George investigate.

299
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,510
Tookie-tookie!

300
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,190
What happened?

301
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,150
Where other monkeys?

302
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,410
Where? There?

303
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,120
How many? That many?

304
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,950
Lots of monkey.
Then what happened?

305
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Tell George more.

306
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,130
No!

307
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,510
Little monkey say other monkeys
call little monkey "runt."

308
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,760
- Not let little monkey play games.
- Poor thing. Hi, monkey.

309
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,350
H-hi. You okay?

310
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,390
No.

311
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,230
Don't cry.

312
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,360
Little monkey like Ursula.

313
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,330
- What did you tell him?
- Just watch.

314
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,070
Meanwhile, back at a really
big footprint in the mud--

315
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,530
Let me through.
What's happening?

316
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,660
This footprint does not
belong to any of my men.

317
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,460
See? There's your proof.
The white ape does exist.

318
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,630
Now all we have to do is track down
the girl and the ape's in the bag.

319
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,630
N-no, seriously. I don't know
if I want to do this again.

320
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,300
Ursula need to relax when it come
to vine swinging, for George.

321
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,600
Swing, swing, swing.
Come on.

322
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,140
Want George of jungle to tell you
special vine-swinging secret?

323
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,350
Fine. Tell me all your secrets.

324
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,150
George's secrets. 
There's the shortest book ever written.

325
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:29,110
- - Wrap it around your sock for
special George of jungle foot lock.

326
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,700
- Now, ready to try again?
- No.

327
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,260
- Like this, Ursula!
- He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

328
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,760
our daring young man
on the flying trapeze

329
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,310
- look, no hands!
- His movements so graceful
all girls he could please

330
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,900
and with love
he is swinging away

331
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,780
- he flies through the air
with the greatest of ease.
- that's pretty good.

332
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,160
- George, watch out for that...
- Our daring young man on the--

333
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,910
Tree.

334
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the king of the jungle.

335
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,600
Where the devil is my egg timer?

336
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,360
- Tookie-tookie.
- Tookie!

337
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,230
I'm fed up with this felonious fowl
stealing everything in the kitchen.

338
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,450
- Miserable creature.
- Tookie-tookie.

339
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,700
George, what on earth
are you doing?

340
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,120
George just feel like looking
a little special today, that all.

341
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,790
Possibly there is a stirring
of special feelings within you?

342
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,930
George having stirring
of special feelings right now.

343
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,850
I see.

344
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,480
- Good thing she same species?
- Yes.

345
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,530
Ape?

346
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,360
Tell George how to make
Ursula George's mate.

347
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,740
Please? Brother?

348
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,960
First, command her attention by bulging
out your cheeks and pursing your lips.

349
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,960
- Show George.
- All right. Just like this. Watch.

350
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,130
Even puffier.

351
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,100
Next, display your interest
by drawing back your upper lip...

352
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,390
Jutting your jaw forward
and exposing your teeth.

353
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,980
- Like this? Like this? Right?
- Now, throw a handful
of leaves in the air...

354
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,860
Then leap about and hoot
in a dominant fashion.

355
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,660
- Like this, ape?
- Good. She won't be able to resist that.

356
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,040
Ursula!

357
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,750
Gosh, this trail's really rough.

358
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,260
"Ursula! Ursula!"

359
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,890
- Hey, come back here.
- They're not abandoning us, are they?

360
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,100
They are threatening.

361
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,390
If you don't mind, kwame...

362
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,690
I have a knack for getting
the most out of my employees.

363
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,860
- Do you mind if I address the porters?
- They only speak Swahili.

364
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,030
Well, I just happen to have
a Swahili phrase book.

365
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,450
Be my guest.

366
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,270
I think our troubles are over.

367
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,980
Tell them I'll pay 50 zamoles
a man if they'll help me capture
the white ape and bring him back alive.

368
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:36,150
Alive? After he--

369
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,320
Well, he pulled Ursula's scrunchie off,
we know that much.

370
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,030
- 50 zamoles a man. What do you say?
- They only speak Swahili.

371
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,910
One hundred zamoles a man
and you got a deal.

372
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,040
- Hey, wait a second.
- Done.

373
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,790
Meanwhile, at a very big
and expensive waterfall set...

374
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,090
Ursula was amazed that she was lost
in the wilderness with a jungle man.

375
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,970
Here I am, lost in the wilderness
with a jungle man.

376
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,440
I should be terrified that no one
will ever find me, but I'm not.

377
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,360
- Thank you.
- For what?

378
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,860
For this adventure.

379
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,400
It's what I've always wanted.

380
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,700
King of jungle
only here to help.

381
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,670
Mr boombastic

382
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,500
the awesome, boombastic
romantic, fantastic lover

383
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,760
sade

384
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,010
mr lover-lover

385
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,100
- mr lover-lover.
- George, are you okay?

386
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,680
- Mr lover-lover.
- Your face is swelling up like--

387
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,020
- Mr lover-lover.
- Is something in my teeth?

388
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,280
Okay.

389
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,500
Listen, um...

390
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,170
I'm gonna step outside
for a little air, okay?

391
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:23,380
- Are you sure you threw the leaves?
- Yeah, George threw leaves.

392
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,430
Well, cheer up, old boy.
I spent all day...

393
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,890
Poring through every book
in the library...

394
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,980
And finally I found this.

395
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,150
It's positively packed full
of human courtship rituals.

396
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,860
Listen.
"What's a nice girl like you...

397
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,070
Doing in a plane like this?"

398
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,000
Go for it.

399
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,630
- Hi.
- Hi.

400
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,010
What--.

401
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:17,810
- Did you fight a crocodile for this?
- No, George not fight.

402
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,820
Crocodile have toothache.

403
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,780
George pull tooth.
Crocodile give to George after. Gift.

404
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,240
Good juju.

405
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,280
- Juju?
- Good luck. Protection.

406
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,540
I have something like that too.
Want to see?

407
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,050
It's not worth anything.

408
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,130
I found it in a cereal box
when I was ten years old.

409
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,720
It's my good luck. My juju.

410
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,310
Can I--

411
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,950
I want you to have that.

412
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,160
For George?

413
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,620
That's the nicest present
George ever get.

414
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,500
Thank you.

415
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,760
- All right, man.
- Yeah.

416
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,480
It dancin' time.

417
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,020
- Ursula, wanna dance?
- No. Thanks.

418
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,190
- I'd be too embarrassed.
- What mean "embarrassed"?

419
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,450
That's when you feel stupid
in front of other people.

420
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,120
You know, like
they're judging you.

421
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,080
- You've never felt that?
- No.

422
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,710
There are no other people.

423
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,130
- Good point.
- George not feel stupid.

424
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,130
Sometimes George smash
into tree, and sometime--

425
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,390
Sometimes George fall out of tree house,
but not feel stupid.

426
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,390
Something good
always happen after.

427
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,890
George just lucky, I guess.

428
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,770
One day I looked up
and there you were

429
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,110
no people here to look stupid for.
Just George.

430
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,820
Like a simple question
looking for an answer

431
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,450
now I am a whale
listening to some inner call

432
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,460
swimming blindly to throw
myself upon your shore

433
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,300
what if I don't find you
when I have landed

434
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,800
would you leave me here to die
on your shore, stranded

435
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,050
think I know why
the dog howls at the moon.

436
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,310
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

437
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,060
I sing dela, dela

438
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,360
when I'm with you.

439
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,040
I burn for you

440
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,660
I've been waiting for you
all my life

441
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,710
hoping for a miracle

442
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,550
I've been waiting day and night
day and night

443
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,050
I've been waiting for you all my life
waiting for redemption

444
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,850
I've been waiting day and night
I burn for you

445
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,450
and so it came to pass
that George of the jungle...

446
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,160
Attended his first co-ed dance.

447
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,340
But his rapturous rendezvous with the
urban heiress was to be short-lived...

448
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,010
As the very next morning, kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close.

449
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,760
That is, dangerously close to shoving
a coconut up Lyle's sleeping bag.

450
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,770
That's it! I've had it!

451
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,020
I am the richest, smartest, handsomest
guy here, so I get to go first.

452
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,280
There's an elephant around here.

453
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,410
Bad guy falls in poop.
Classical element of physical comedy.

454
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,120
Now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh. Ready?

455
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,620
Ready.

456
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,300
Those were nowhere near
properly digested.

457
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,430
In case anybody's
wondering, I'm okay.

458
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,300
Have you cleaned my lighter yet?

459
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,190
Come on, come on.

460
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,030
That was Ursula.
Did you hear that?

461
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,870
She's alive. Ursula--

462
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,410
Why don't you bring on a brass band
while you're at it, you nit?

463
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,540
We gotta be stealthy here, right?

464
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,120
Stealthy. Right.

465
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:38,220
Party time.
We'll take it from here.

466
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,480
Get off!

467
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,570
It's him!

468
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,120
Hey, it's a dude. I told you
there weren't no white ape.

469
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,580
You dragged me all the way
up here to look at some guy
in a leopard-skin bikini.

470
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,250
- If I wanted to see that,
I could've stayed in Miami.
- Wait a second.

471
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,840
The white ape is a man?
Let me at him.

472
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,420
Hang on. Could you, see
if he's dangerous?

473
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,590
Here, boy!
Where's my little doggy?

474
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,390
I've got a feeling he's not.

475
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,560
Okay. I'll go first.

476
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,430
If he gets aggressive,
I'll scare him off with this.

477
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,440
- I thought that was a lighter.
- It is a lighter,
but he doesn't know that.

478
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,200
Ursula, it's me.

479
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,200
Lyle. Your man.
I've come for you. Are you okay?

480
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,960
Ursula!

481
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,880
- Lyle, what are you doing here?
- Thank God.

482
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,050
Mushy bear, you're safe.
I don't believe it!

483
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,550
I was so afraid
for your safety.

484
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,140
Lyle! Don't get all smoochy
and disgusting with me, okay?

485
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,560
I remember what you did
when that lion came.

486
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,360
What are you talking about?
I was fighting the lion the whole time.

487
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,650
You were just so terrified
you don't remember.

488
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,820
- I remember George,
that's who I remember.
- George?

489
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,160
Look over there.
What do you see?

490
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,870
- An elephant.
- But what has the elephant got?

491
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,090
- Fleas.
- Ivory! White gold.

492
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,430
Listen, Ursula, I have no idea what
you're talking about. Can we just go?

493
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,550
- George!
- Ursula!

494
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,600
Ready...

495
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,930
Aim...

496
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,320
Run, shep!
Run for your life!

497
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,480
Did that monkey just speak?

498
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,610
That monkey just spoke.

499
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,780
- I knew it.
- He talked.

500
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,870
Shoot it now.

501
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,040
With the tranquillizer gun, idiot!
That ape's worth a fortune.

502
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,000
No!

503
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,750
Stop, or I'll shoot!

504
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,090
- No!
- No!

505
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:32,680
George!

506
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,890
Okay, kids, let's settle down
and review the important information.

507
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,190
Lyle is a big doofus.
Poor George was really shot...

508
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,940
But can't die because,
let's face it, he's the hero.

509
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,530
So, the naturally concerned
and preternaturally wealthy
Ursula stanhope...

510
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:48,950
Whisked George off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth...

511
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:52,080
Where he would get the finest
medical treatment available.

512
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,250
I'm gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available.

513
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,540
As for those pesky, pernicious
and putrid poachers, Max and Thor...

514
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,000
They awaited their fate
in the bujumbura jail.

515
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,720
You two, out.

516
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,090
- Acquitted?
- No, deported.

517
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,260
Meanwhile, kwame and his men faced
the next-to-impossible task...

518
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:18,350
Of picking out George's assailant
from a line-up of the usual suspects.

519
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,020
Too short. Too sweaty.

520
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,650
Wait a second! That's the guy.
That's the guy who shot him.

521
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,610
- I never forget a face.
- Me?

522
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,370
No, Max. Forget about it. I do not want
to listen to any more of your ideas.

523
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,750
You'll like this one. We're gonna steal
Georgie-boy's talking ape.

524
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,460
- You mean, back up the Mountain?
- Thor, that ape is our ticket...

525
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,220
Out of poaching
and into show business.

526
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,390
- No.
- Think about it. We got a talking ape.

527
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,470
What do siegfried and Roy have?

528
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,970
- Sequins?
- Exactly.

529
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,060
Get ready for room service,
mate, and girls.

530
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,520
We're gettin' our ape
and going to Vegas.

531
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,900
By next weekend,
we'll be headlining at the tropicana.

532
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,400
- Nobody is gonna stop us.
- Right.

533
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,320
George of the jungle
must be halfway to frisco by now.

534
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,070
But the plotting poachers
were only half correct...

535
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,700
For at that very moment, our handsome
hero was all the way to San Francisco.

536
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,080
- Yes, mother, I'm safe.
- You're sure you didn't
catch dengue fever?

537
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,250
No, mother, I did not
catch dengue fever.

538
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,670
- Well, how's your temperature?
- Normal.

539
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,010
- Colour of your tongue?
- Pink.

540
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,180
- What about your 
- Regular.

541
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,390
Now, Lyle.
How is my darling future son-in-law?

542
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,260
Lyle is--

543
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,230
He's happy to be home, mom.
Could you hold on one second?

544
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:52,610
George, please don't call any animals
into the car, okay? Thanks.

545
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,280
Mom? You there?

546
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,620
Mom, hold on. I'm losing you again.
George. George. No.

547
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,290
Are you paying any attention?
This is important.

548
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,670
No. I know it's important. Geo-geo--
George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

549
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,760
This faster than riding big,
great, peanut-loving poochie shep.

550
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,300
Love you, mom. Gotta go.
Bye. Watch out for that--

551
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,010
Ooh!

552
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,060
So, what do you
think of my jungle?

553
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,780
This very high tree house.

554
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,150
Good place to call friends from.
Sound carry.

555
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,780
No, no, no, no, no.

556
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,410
The neighbours.

557
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
- Give it a rest!
- We're ten storeys up, George.

558
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,420
I don't think the animals
can make it up here.

559
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,050
Sure.
George know that.

560
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,170
George know that.

561
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,140
You must be tired. I'll, um...

562
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,690
Make the couch up for you
to sleep in the living room.

563
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,940
No. George sleep here
in tree house.

564
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,030
Okay. Good night.

565
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,490
Sleep sweet, Ursula.

566
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,870
Sleep sweet, George.

567
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,960
Ooh.

568
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,960
Well, Ursula's fiance
is in prison...

569
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,340
And there's a jungle man
sleeping on her balcony.

570
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:36,840
- She could use a best friend right now.
- Hi.

571
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,890
- Hi.
- I got here as fast as I could.

572
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,560
- Where is he?
- He's under the waterf--
he's in the shower.

573
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,560
Not any more.

574
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,560
- George.
- Bad waterfall.

575
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,980
First water get hot, then George slip
on this strange, yellow rock.!

576
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,030
- Hi. George of jungle.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

577
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,530
George.
Um, take this big book.

578
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,160
Whoop! Cover the Booty,
get into decent clothes.

579
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,870
- Sorry, Betsy.
- Bye.
- No problem.

580
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,540
- Okay.
- I see why they made him
king of the jungle.

581
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,750
Betsy, I am
in trouble here, okay?

582
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,170
How am I gonna tell my parents
that my fiance's in an African jail...

583
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,130
And that I brought home
a jungle man?

584
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,840
You are totally stuck
on George?

585
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,760
No, I am not!

586
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,180
- Can I have him then?
- Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.

587
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,350
Think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think.
What am I gonna do about tomorrow?

588
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,400
Tomorrow is your engagement party,
and unless they give day passes...

589
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,570
Out of bujumbura jail,
Lyle is not likely to attend.

590
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,360
So tell 'em the truth and don't
worry about it and take George.

591
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,700
- He can back up your story. Right?
- Yeah. All right.

592
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,910
So I'll tell my dad
first thing in the morning.

593
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,040
Make it second thing. First thing, I
suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.

594
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,550
Nice butt flap.

595
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Being of a conservative mind
regarding gender roles...

596
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,890
Ursula stanhope
wasted no time...

597
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,560
In taking George of the jungle
to a fine haberdasher.

598
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:19,570
- And this is neiman Marcus.
- Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.

599
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,990
Hello. Would you like
to sample our new fragrance?

600
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,080
Thank you.

601
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,170
Later, in the men's department, after
discovering his long-lost brothers...

602
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,880
The jungle king was pleased to find
he looked pretty good in Armani.

603
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:43,640
Pretty darn good.

604
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,970
Watch out, man!

605
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,560
Why everyone run around crazy,
like antelope in mating season?

606
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,940
They're just trying to make a living.
It's-- different kind
of jungle here, George.

607
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,770
It's survival of the fittest.
Dog eat dog.

608
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:01,150
- "Dog eat dog" -- dog eat dog here?
- No, that's not what I meant.

609
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,280
George never bring shep here.
. Never.

610
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:07,030
Every story gets to have a really big
coincidence, and here's ours.

611
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,500
Who should see them walking down
the street but Ursula's meddling mother?

612
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,660
Yes, Lyle van de groot,
please.

613
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,880
- I'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.
- He's not?

614
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
No. I'm sorry.

615
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,550
Meanwhile, back on ape Mountain...

616
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,890
George's friends were going positively
ga-ga from missing the jungle king.

617
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,720
No!

618
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,060
Look at this.
It's ruined. Ruined!

619
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,850
Shep, come here at once.

620
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,850
Come on!

621
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,900
How many times do I have to tell you?
My violin bow is not a chew toy!

622
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,650
Bad dog!

623
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,070
And you! Out of my sight,
you feathered fool.

624
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,330
No! Not on the tree house!
I'll smack you--

625
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,420
Ursula, it's mother.
Pick up the phone...

626
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,710
And tell me who that man was
I saw you strolling with today.

627
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,880
And where is Lyle?
We must discuss the engagement party.

628
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:10,060
I know you're there, Ursula.
Pick up the phone and tell me
why you have been avoiding me.

629
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,560
Pick up the phone!

630
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,440
Well, I think that
was an overreaction.

631
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,110
Just make sure you stay here
while I'm at work...

632
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:26,700
And you can watch TV
and eat and relax.

633
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,160
And I'll be back as soon as I can.
Just stay here.

634
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,450
"Stay here"? George is king
of the jungle. No four walls built
by modern man can contain him.

635
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,750
Not true. George have every intention
of doing exactly what Ursula say.

636
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,760
- Really? Is that so?
- For a while.

637
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,760
And at that very moment,
Betsy and Ursula were on their way to
break the news about Lyle to her father.

638
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,470
- Good luck, kiddo.
- Surprise!

639
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,440
Ursula, welcome home,
sweetheart...

640
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,650
And happy engagement day.

641
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,030
Chock full o' nuts

642
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,780
the heavenly coffee

643
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:12,950
- the coffee that brings you together.
- When you're in love

644
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,790
now George understand. George get
coffee, then Ursula want George.

645
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,810
Java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java.

646
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,230
So the low has moved offshore.
High pressure's built a Ridge in.

647
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:40,480
The weather
is absolutely gorgeous.

648
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,150
- If you're not outside, you oughta be!
- Who, me?

649
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,610
I mean you.

650
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,490
Okay!

651
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,070
And so, jazzed on java...

652
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,870
George of the jungle made his way
into the city by the bay.

653
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,330
Whoo!

654
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,000
Quickly taking to tourism,
the jungle king enjoyed...

655
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,340
The first drive-through
dining of his life...

656
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,800
And strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating...

657
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,970
Ooh!

658
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,730
But nothing excited
the jungle king more...

659
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,820
Than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen.

660
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,570
Ooh. Yeah.

661
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,260
- Help!
- Ooh.

662
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,340
Somebody help!

663
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,240
- To swing or not to swing?
- Help!

664
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,490
Swing.

665
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:29,750
As the king of the jungle
quickly calculated the angle
and velocity of his next big swing...

666
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,760
Ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself.

667
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,050
I feel so guilty.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

668
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:41,390
I suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him.

669
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,730
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, honey. Take a look at this.

670
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:47,270
The most remarkable thing
is happening on the bay bridge.

671
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,280
Where strong winds
have carried him to the bay bridge.

672
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,440
Our own Valerie devlin
is live on the scene. Valerie?

673
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,530
Thank you, terilyn.
We do have a breaking story...

674
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,070
- At the bay bridge...
- Help!
- Where a parasailor dangles...

675
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,160
- Helplessly, 500 feet above the water.
- Please! Hurry up! Help!

676
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,630
There's no word on who
this lone daredevil is.

677
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,460
- That's George.
- He appears to have some kind
of rope in his hand.

678
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,760
- He might be preparing to swing on it.
- I gotta go.

679
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,650
Excuse me, sir.
I have to get on this boat.

680
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,710
Hey, fella. George of jungle.
Need a vine?

681
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,340
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
G-get me out of this stuff?

682
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,390
- Thanks, man.
- Don't mention it.

683
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,520
King of jungle only here to help!

684
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:16,700
- George!
- Ursula!!

685
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,720
Watch out for that--

686
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,270
- George!
- Ursula!
- What are you doing? Are you okay?

687
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,440
- You just saved that man's life!
- George just lucky, I guess.

688
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:59,200
Ooh. This coffee stuff
really work good.

689
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,240
One of the most daring rescues
ever recorded live on television.

690
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,870
This is Valerie devlin reporting
to you from under the bay bridge.
Back to you, terilyn.

691
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,540
You know, they say the city by the bay
is the most romantic in the world...

692
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,750
And it looks as though
there might be a little romance
unfolding under the bay bridge.

693
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,720
We'll be back in a moment.

694
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,470
Meanwhile, back in the jungle--

695
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,390
There's five stinkin' apes out there.
Which one are we takin' to Vegas?

696
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,980
- The one who's playing chess.
- Checkmate.

697
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,360
- Yes!
- Sweet dreams, banana breath.
- Grab him!

698
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,530
Tookie. Go find George.

699
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,820
Tookie-tookie.

700
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,170
Thor.

701
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,720
Let's get him in the cage
while he's still under. Come on.

702
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,220
As the pesky poachers
grunted and groaned...

703
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,060
Pushing and pulling
the ponderous primate along...

704
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,190
The trusty tookie-tookie bird
was already winging to the rescue...

705
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:16,860
Making a bird-line
for San Francisco...

706
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,360
Where George of the jungle was trying
to give the heiress Ursula...

707
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,530
The courage to face her parents...

708
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,570
By helping her discover
the juju within.

709
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,120
- Make jungle call.
Then you'll feel brave.
- No. I can't.

710
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,870
- Come on. Big breath.
Here. Support voice.
- N-no. No, no, no.

711
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,080
- Ursula, please? Pl-- please?
- No, no!

712
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:39,590
- I can't do it.
- Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.
Come on, Ursula.

713
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,520
- Wow.
- Not bad for beginner.

714
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,230
- Hi, Ursula.
- Emboldened with jungle juju...
- Hi.

715
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,110
Ursula stanhope went inside
to break the news to her parents,
who took it extremely well.

716
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,240
Mother, daddy,
I love you both very much.

717
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,450
I have something
very important to tell you...

718
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,910
And I hope you'll understand.

719
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,040
- I don't want to marry Lyle any more.
- We understand, dear.

720
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,960
Just kidding.

721
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:28,890
- The young miss stanhope
proceeded to spill the beans...
- So, anyway, I went to the jungle--

722
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,890
Very quickly...

723
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,570
Until she got to
the important part at the end.

724
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:47,490
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle
is in jail and George is with me...

725
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,570
And I don't want to marry
Lyle any more.

726
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,200
I knew it. It's that swinging man
from the bridge.

727
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,210
I saw you smooching on TV.

728
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,420
- Mother, we weren't smooching--
- How could you do this to me?

729
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,420
Don't you realize the calibre of people
who are going to be here?

730
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,010
- Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say--
- I thought we would be
introducing them...

731
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:09,220
To Lyle van de groot, not some
wild man you found in the jungle.

732
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,970
Beatrice, this is supposed to be
her wedding, not yours.

733
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,970
- So?
- Beatrice, I know you're upset...

734
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,310
And so am I, but we can't force her
to marry someone against her will.

735
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,400
- Why not?
- Mom. Dad.

736
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,690
I'm ready to go out there
and apologize to everybody
and tell them what really happened.

737
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,530
Absolutely not!

738
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:31,620
As far as I'm concerned, you--
You caught one of those viruses.

739
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,240
Yes, one of those dreadful
jungle viruses...

740
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,540
That get nice girls all confused.

741
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,210
And if Lyle survives that
awful jail, you will simply
have to kiss and make up.

742
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:45,550
As for this evening, we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on.

743
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:50,010
Now, darling, where is that charming
young friend of yours?

744
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,850
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know.
He's around here someplace.

745
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:56,100
- Well, find him. We haven't got
all day. Ursula, look!
- Great!

746
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:01,600
How wonderful!
And look at Richard's exquisite
figurines of you and darling Lyle.

747
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,070
George, watch out for that--

748
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,450
Mom. Dad. This is George.

749
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,620
Hello, mr and mrs Ursula.

750
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,460
How do you do?

751
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,810
It is always such a pleasure
to see you, mr mayor.

752
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:42,480
And, you know, it's so nice
to get away from city hall...

753
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,690
And be around some normal people
for a change.

754
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:50,190
Well, we are perfectly normal,
I assure you-- in an exceptional way,
of course.

755
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,660
Of course.
A-and what about this guy, Lyle?

756
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,160
You know, I'd really like to meet
the man you deem good enough
to marry your daughter.

757
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,620
Well, unfortunately Lyle
is busy at the moment...

758
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,830
Tending to some legal affairs.

759
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:08,670
- Some pate, mr mayor?
- You know, I never touch that stuff.-.

760
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,670
- I had a lovely time.
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Excuse me, dr goldblum.

761
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,510
It's 7:30. Do you know where
your jungle man is?

762
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,350
So this is what you were doing
in the jungle. Clever girl.

763
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,020
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk.

764
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,190
- I knew it.
- He's not a real meat loaf, is he?

765
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,030
No. I mean,
he's not brainy...

766
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,160
In that doctor, lawyer,
banker way...

767
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,740
But he has something else.

768
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:41,620
- He has a--
- Sensual intelligence.

769
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,710
"Sensual intelligence."

770
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,840
- Wow.
- My God.

771
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,920
What is it with chicks
and horses?

772
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,070
George, how are you this evening?

773
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,030
Pretty sharp threads there,
-- George, right?

774
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,490
- Yeah. Where're you based?
- The jungle.

775
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,750
I hear ya.
We cut our teeth in New York also.

776
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,080
You considering a position
with stanhope? That could be fruitful.

777
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,090
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.
Nobody here have big coconuts.

778
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:37,300
George.

779
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,100
I wa--.

780
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:42,180
Would you mind
stepping outside with me--

781
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,560
Thank you so much--
For just a moment?

782
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,060
Sure.

783
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,360
- Hello, Beatrice.
- Hello, Ella.

784
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,570
Well, we haven't been friends
for very long, George...

785
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,200
But I already think I know
something about you.

786
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:02,620
You are in love with my daughter.

787
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:07,330
- Mrs Ursula not so dumb.
- George.

788
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,630
My concern, however, is that Ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings...

789
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,340
And that does present
a problem to me.

790
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,140
You see,
you and Ursula together...

791
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,770
Would be unbefitting
her social stature.

792
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:27,890
You see? Let me put it in a way
you might understand.

793
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,480
Where you come from...

794
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:34,230
Zebras marry zebras
and leopards marry leopards.

795
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,150
Stripes with stripes,
spots with spots.

796
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,780
Well, Ursula is a stripe
and you are a spot...

797
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:46,040
One which I intend to have removed
as soon as possible.

798
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,870
So you no want Ursula
to love George.

799
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,540
I would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast.

800
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,260
- That hurt.
- Not as much as you will
if you do anything...

801
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,130
To screw up my daughter's marriage
to Lyle van de groot.

802
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,300
When Lyle returns, this wedding
will proceed as planned.

803
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:07,060
If you do anything to upset that...

804
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,940
I will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth.

805
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,070
Steak tartare, mrs stanhope?

806
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:18,610
No, no. Thank you.
I've had quite enough protein for today.

807
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,490
Have a pleasant evening,
mr jungle.

808
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,720
Tookie? Tookie!

809
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:53,560
Tookie.
George so happy to see tookie.

810
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,990
Ape kidnapped?
Ape ape-napped?

811
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,490
George save ape!

812
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,620
Ursula.

813
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:08,260
Well, of course he went back to the
jungle. Where else would go-- the hague?

814
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,470
But why would he leave
without saying goodbye?

815
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,520
Well, personally I think he acted
rather sensibly. Showed good character.

816
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,980
He understands that he belongs there,
you belong here.

817
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:21,530
It's really all a question
of stripes and spots.

818
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,740
What? No.

819
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,450
You got to him.
Mother, what did you say?

820
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:30,530
I simply said that if he
really cared for you...

821
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,960
He'd leave you alone and let you
get on with your life and marry Lyle.

822
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,790
- I am not marrying Lyle, mother.
- Beatrice, perhaps we should just--

823
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,
don't be ridiculous.

824
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,760
There's a big difference
between marriageable material
and a fling in the jungle.

825
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,800
"A fling in the jungle"?
"A fling in the jungle."

826
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,930
Who says I had
a fling in the jungle?

827
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:52,850
You don't think you can
fool your mother, do you?

828
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:56,440
You've been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here.

829
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:01,690
Now, Ursula, that kind of love
is fleeting. You'll get over it.

830
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:12,080
- Did you just say "love"?
- No.

831
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,120
- You did.
- Ursula.
- You're right.

832
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,960
- Don't say it.
- I love him. I'm outta here.

833
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,960
Ursula, you can't love him.
Arthur, say something.

834
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,210
- Be careful out there, honey.
- What?

835
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,670
- Goodbye, daddy.
- I love you.

836
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,300
- Wha--
- I love you, mom. Thank you.

837
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:31,470
- Ursula-- Arthur, do something!
- What would you have me do?

838
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,890
- There's obviously no stopping her.
- God.

839
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,360
- Ursula!
- God, that woman's a pain in the ass.

840
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:48,070
Meanwhile,
halfway across the world...

841
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,360
Another ass was feeling pain...

842
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,200
As an ape named ape
was caged in a cage...

843
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,040
Hoping to hear
the jungle king's awesome--

844
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,790
Hey, I'm pretty good at that--

845
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
And wondering
if he would ever come.

846
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,300
But the motion-sick mammal
needn't have moaned...

847
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:11,300
For that defender of the innocent,
protector of the weak...

848
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,850
And all-around good guy
George of the jungle...

849
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,480
Was closer than he knew.

850
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,190
Next time George get bigger box.

851
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,710
Bad luck.

852
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,880
- Did you hear something?
- What?

853
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,510
- I heard a noise.
- Shut up and push!

854
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:42,060
I think I chipped a tooth.

855
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:49,610
- Thor, you're disgusting.
- God, that wasn't me.

856
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:52,530
Not me.

857
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,930
- I'm hungry.
- Shut up.

858
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:21,640
You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,
and I'm gettin' mad enough to--

859
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:24,060
You know, you really should
work on your anger.

860
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:27,980
Have you tried brankowski's
"cage the rage" technique?

861
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:30,610
Don't let him get to you, Thor.
He's just an ape.

862
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:33,440
That's a fine way to talk
to your meal ticket.

863
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:36,240
You keep that up, it's liable
to affect my stage performance.

864
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,990
Give him a banana, Thor.
It won't be long now.

865
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,200
That's what you said yesterday.

866
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,370
This trail's taking us
to the middle of nowhere.

867
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,960
The sign at the trail head said
"short cut to ape river."

868
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,590
Now, why would it say "short cut"
if it wasn't a--

869
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:55,420
Wait a minute.
Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.

870
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:58,840
Very good, Max.
Actually, the trail is a fake.

871
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:04,060
It circles ape Mountain six times before
heading right back to the tree house.

872
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:08,310
- I knew we was lost.
- Don't listen to him, Thor.

873
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,770
He's just tryin' to trick us,
lead us off the short cut...

874
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,690
So we take twice as long
on the regular trail.

875
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,070
We're already taking twice as long!

876
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,160
Are you gonna let a monkey
make a monkey out of ya?

877
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,080
- What?
- Duh!

878
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:27,120
Let's go. If he tells us the short cut
leads to the tree house...

879
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:30,250
Then that's exactly
where it doesn't lead.

880
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,050
Ape?

881
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:07,370
- Poor ape-napped brother.
- Careful.

882
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,830
Max, look.
We're back at the tree house.

883
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,670
Well, I tried, but you fellas
are just too smart for me.

884
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,930
- No!
- "No" was right,
for the exhausted ape-nappers had--

885
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:25,140
Hey! Why don't you say something
constructive for a change,
like what we should do now.

886
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:29,060
- Because I don't like you.
- Well, I hate you, you snotty son of a--

887
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:33,730
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Having some fun now?

888
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:36,610
- Thor, were you fighting
with the narrator?
- Well, he started it.

889
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:38,280
- Did not.
- You did too!

890
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,150
- Did not.
- You did too!
- Did not!

891
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,950
- You did too!
- Thor, stop it!

892
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:44,700
That's it. I'm not draggin'
this thing another inch.

893
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,200
- What are you doing? Get back there
and work. Where are you going?
- You wretched little weasel.

894
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,210
Aren't you the little weasel,
you big brontosaurus?

895
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,260
Let's take care of him.

896
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:03,260
Whoa!
Why didn't you come sooner?

897
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,970
Why ape have little stars
around head?

898
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:12,980
George, remember
everything I taught you about
queensberry rules and fighting fair?

899
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,610
Well, now's a good time to forget it.

900
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:17,900
Let's finish him off.

901
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:26,530
- I can't breathe, Max.
- Let it out, Thor. Let it out.

902
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,000
Right, jungle boy.

903
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,850
Tookie-tookie!

904
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,760
- Take this!
- Stop it! Ape!

905
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:51,200
Get it off!
Get it off of me, Max!

906
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,850
All right!

907
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:13,560
Shep, look out!

908
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,060
Ursula?

909
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,360
George good teacher.

910
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,370
George. George.
I came all this way to tell you that--

911
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,580
Ursula talk later.
George busy now.

912
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,790
- What?
- Fella got toucan on can.

913
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,300
I know.

914
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:10,610
Good show, George.
And you too, tookie.

915
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:13,950
My hero.

916
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,540
Did I just say that?

917
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:21,080
- George. Over here, George!
- Ape, sit tight. George be right back.

918
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:22,920
I say.

919
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,470
Now George can talk.
What Ursula come back to say?

920
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:41,730
Only that I know in my heart...

921
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:46,020
That I really, truly--

922
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:49,240
- Haven't seen the light yet.
- Lyle.

923
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,410
- Lyle?
- Yes, Lyle.

924
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:54,530
For the venal van de groot had escaped
from the bujumbura jail...

925
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,910
And joined an obscure cult
on the shores of lake tanganyika...

926
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,790
Which had empowered him with
a peculiar piece of parchment.

927
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:04,710
- What are you doing here?
- Surprised, my little cupcake?

928
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,880
You see, I'm now
an mail-order minister...

929
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,550
Ordained the church of celestial
power and light, incorporated...

930
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:16,260
Capable of performing legally binding
marriage ceremonies anywhere.

931
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:19,350
- Lyle, I'm not marrying you.
- Actually, you are.

932
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:21,940
- Come on, let's go.
Come along, my little African queen.
- George.

933
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:25,690
Now George really mad.
George tear off your--

934
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:31,190
- At ease, jungle boy.
- Everybody freeze now!

935
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,610
Operation completed
as ordered, sir.

936
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:38,410
Thank you, Gunnar, gunter,
hans, jan and Phil.

937
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:42,250
No hard feelings, stone belly.

938
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,540
The best man won.
That's all.

939
01:16:44,670 --> 01:16:48,500
I should say, the guy who brought
mercenaries won. That's all.

940
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:52,170
Okay, honey, you ready to go? I got
a boat waitin' to take us to bujumbura.

941
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,970
- Come on.
- George!
- Ursula.

942
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,090
- Come on.
- No!
- Don't go that way!

943
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,220
- Go that way. No--
- See you later.

944
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:04,270
- George! Stop it! Stop it!
- Ursula!

945
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:08,480
- Lyle, let go of me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

946
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:40,260
Bongo-gram!
Work every time.

947
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:44,520
Good work, brother apes.
Now listen very carefully to George.

948
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,570
Let 'er rip, shep.

949
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:04,250
Stop it! Stop it, Lyle!

950
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:07,920
- Come on.
- Let go. Stop it! You're such a jerk!

951
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:14,590
Come on in there!
Come here!

952
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,890
You know, I forgive you, and I'm
willing to give you yet another chance.

953
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:22,560
Lyle, you don't where you're go--

954
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:47,620
Where's George?

955
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:55,050
You see? I told you
I'd have a boat waiting.

956
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:25,290
Okay, then. All righty.

957
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:28,370
Reverend Lyle
ready to perform the ceremony.

958
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Do you, Ursula stanhope,
take me, Lyle van de groot...

959
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:35,800
- To be your lawful wedded husband?
- Get a grip, Lyle.

960
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,770
- Lyle.
- Yeah, honey?

961
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:50,100
- Lyle?
- My God!

962
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,830
Lyle!

963
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,040
Tookie-tookie!

964
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:17,130
Thanks, tookie.

965
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,630
This biggest swing
in jungle history.

966
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,180
Will hurt very much,
but George have to do it.

967
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,470
- George!
- What the--

968
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:14,230
- This gonna hurt.
- George, watch out for that tree!

969
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,490
George not feel so good.

970
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:41,920
Thank God we've made it.
Say "I do," Ursula.

971
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:46,090
That's it. We're married.
Now to look at my bride.

972
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,470
No!

973
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,560
No! No!

974
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:07,030
George, what I came here to say
was that I love you.

975
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,870
- Ursula love George?
- So much.

976
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:16,370
George love Ursula too.

977
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,170
And so George of the jungle received
the first kiss of his life...

978
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:23,840
That came from
neither elephant nor ape.

979
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,800
And on the following new moon...

980
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:31,850
Ursula stanhope finally got
the simple wedding she had hoped for...

981
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:34,720
As the San Francisco heiress
and the king of the jungle...

982
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:38,810
Joined their hearts forever
in wedded bliss.

983
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,440
- The rings!
- The rings.

984
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:46,610
The rings? Tookie.

985
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,580
Tookie.

986
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,350
Arthur, I wish you'd do something
about all these monkeys.

987
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,890
I feel like Jane goodall.

988
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:21,270
Madam, I knew Jane goodall,
and you are no Jane goodall.

989
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:37,290
Listenin' to some inner call

990
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:41,540
swimmin' blindly
to throw myself upon your shore

991
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:44,090
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon.

992
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:50,090
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

993
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:55,220
and I sing, dela, dela

994
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:00,480
when I'm with you.

995
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:10,150
I burn for you

996
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,660
I been waiting for you
all my life

997
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,570
hoping for a miracle

998
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,950
I been waiting day and night

999
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,540
day and night

1000
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:22,170
I been waiting for you
all my life

1001
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,040
waiting for redemption

1002
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:26,130
I been waiting day and night

1003
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,630
I burn for you.

1004
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:35,220
- I love you.
- Good boy.

1005
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,890
And so ends our tale
of that defender of the innocent...

1006
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:42,310
Protector of the weak
and all-around good guy...

1007
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,150
George of the jungle.

1008
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:47,940
A noble king,
his beautiful queen...

1009
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,690
And their nimble young heir
to the jungle throne.

1010
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,530
George, watch out for that--

1011
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:57,490
I know what you're thinking--
How does a baby raised by an ape...

1012
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:01,120
Grow up to be king of the jungle,
find his queen...

1013
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,870
And live happily ever after?

1014
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,170
George just lucky, I guess.

1015
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:10,510
George, George
George of the jungle

1016
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:12,760
strong as he can be

1017
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,260
watch out for that tree

1018
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:19,560
George, George
George of the jungle

1019
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:21,720
lives a life that's free

1020
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:26,400
wait a moment! Wait, wait, wait! Don't
you want to know what happened to me?

1021
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:43,620
And now the end is near

1022
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:47,380
and so I face the final curtain

1023
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,920
my friends
I'll say it clear

1024
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:54,630
I'll state my case
of which I'm certain

1025
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,970
I've lived a life that's full

1026
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:01,470
I've travelled
each and every highway

1027
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,390
- and more, much more than this.
- Whoo

1028
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,810
I did it my way
yes!

1029
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:12,230
There were times
I'm sure you knew

1030
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,860
when I bit off
more than I could chew

1031
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,530
but through it all

1032
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,200
- when there was doubt.
- Doubt

1033
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:23,410
I ate it up and spit it out

1034
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:26,620
I faced it all
and I stood tall

1035
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:31,000
and did it my way

1036
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:32,550
doo, doo, doo

1037
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,260
George, George
George of the jungle

1038
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,510
strong as he can be

1039
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:46,020
watch out for that tree

1040
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:48,270
George, George
George of the jungle

1041
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:50,610
lives a life that's free

1042
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:54,650
watch out for that tree

1043
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,950
when he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

1044
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:00,370
with help from his friend
an ape named ape

1045
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,700
and his elephant shep
can fetch a log

1046
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:05,540
he's man's best friend
he's George's dog

1047
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:08,500
he's George, George
George of the jungle

1048
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,750
strong as he can be

1049
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:15,170
watch out for that tree

1050
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,420
George, George
George of the jungle

1051
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:19,680
friend to you and me

1052
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,100
watch out for that tree

1053
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,100
hear him holler
swing and sing

1054
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:29,560
all the animals come
to the jungle king

1055
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:31,850
so grab a vine
and swing in time

1056
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,690
if you slam a tree
just pay no mind

1057
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,740
like George, George
George of the jungle

1058
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:39,900
George, George
George of the jungle

1059
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:42,200
George, George
George of the jungle

1060
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,410
George, George
George of the jungle

1061
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,700
George, George
George of the jungle

1062
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:48,910
George, George
George of the jungle

1063
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,170
George, George
George of the jungle

1064
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:53,330
George, George
George of the jungle

1065
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,630
George, George
George of the jungle

1066
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,880
George, George
George of the jungle

1067
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:00,010
George, George
George of the jungle

1068
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:02,260
George, George
George of the jungle

1069
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:04,470
George, George
George of the jungle

1070
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,760
swing from tree to tree

1071
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:11,310
watch out for that tree

1072
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,610
George, George
George of the jungle

1073
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,860
lives a life that's free

1074
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:20,280
watch out for that tree

1075
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,910
left in the wild was a baby
with a smile named George

1076
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:25,660
who stayed for quite a while

1077
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,950
and George grew up
in the trees above

1078
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,210
when Ursula found him
they found love

1079
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:33,580
she took him to the city
took him straight downtown

1080
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,840
but the concrete bliss
brought poor George down

1081
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,130
so it's back to the jungle
for a wedding in the green

1082
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,340
for the king and queen
of the animal scene

1083
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:45,970
George, George
George of the jungle

1084
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,220
strong as he can be

1085
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,810
watch out for that tree

1086
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:56,810
watch out for that--
Bang! Ooh! Tree

1087
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,490
George, George
George of the jungle

1088
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,370
watch out for that tree

1089
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,600
ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the king of the jungle.
