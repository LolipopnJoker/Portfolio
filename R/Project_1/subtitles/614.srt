<i>MAN: I'm going to</i>

2
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:39,220
<i>But as any good</i>
<i>storyteller knows,</i>

3
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:42,957
<i>one must first be sure</i>

4
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:45,492

5
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:47,895
<i>Does anyone need</i>

6
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:51,031
<i>Oh. You, sir, in the back?</i>

7
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>Well, hold it in.</i>

00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,369
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

9
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,272
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>

10
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,844
<i>My name is Marty Bronson.</i>

11
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:07,547
<i>I owned and operated</i>
<i>the Sunny Vista Motel,</i>

12
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:11,485
<i>which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards</i>

13
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:16,991
<i>in Los Angeles, California,</i>
<i>in the year 1974.</i>

14
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:20,227
<i>The motel was my labor of love,</i>

15
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:23,330
<i>and I ran it with the help</i>
<i>of my children: Wendy...</i>

16
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:28,602
MARTY: Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.

17
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:29,887
Thank you.

18
00:01:29,988 --> 00:01:31,322
<i>And Skeeter.</i>

19
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:37,060
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon?

20
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:39,429
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

21
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:43,667
(GRUNTING)

22
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:45,069
You, uh, need a hand?

23
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,254
No, no. I got it.

24
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:49,590
MR. DIXON: OK.

25
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,878
<i>To my boy Skeeter,</i>
<i>the motel was a wonderland.</i>

26
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,631
Way too hyper.

27
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:59,232
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

28
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,868
<i>A magical place.</i>

29
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:03,871
(CHATTER, LAUGHTER)

30
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:07,741
<i>Full of new adventures</i>
<i>for a six-year-old boy.</i>

31
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:12,379
(LAUGHS)
Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

32
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,368
<i>Skeeter loved the old place</i>
<i>as much as I did.</i>

33
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:22,039
<i>And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.</i>

34
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,309
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

35
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,263
I was thinking we could put an
extra pair of socks in each room

36
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:33,501
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

37
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:35,519
That's a good idea.

38
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,005
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

39
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:40,975
Wait, Dad.
I'm not even tired.

40
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:44,177
Well, how about a bedtime story?

41
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,046
Yay!

42
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:53,070
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

43
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:55,639
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

44
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,777
<i>Well, I could tell a pretty fair
tale when the muse was with me.</i>

45
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,113
<i>And making my little boy smile,</i>

46
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:05,583
<i>now, that was truly magical.</i>

47
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:10,387
<i>Yeah, I was a pretty good dad</i>
<i>and a pretty good host.</i>

48
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:14,908
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>a pretty bad businessman.</i>

49
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,978
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

50
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,447
This motel is sinking in red ink...

51
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,083
and I'm offering you
the last lifeboat.

52
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:24,969
(SIGHS)

53
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,137
I don't know.

54
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:27,972
NOTTHINGHAM:
I've seen the books, Martin.

55
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:32,092
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

56
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:33,877
Yes, well, I...

57
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:37,281
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

58
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:38,882
NOTTINGHAM: How about this?

59
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:42,453
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

60
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,538
I'll let him run this place.

61
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:47,041
(SIGHS)
You promise?

62
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:50,627
Yes. Now sign
the bloody papers.

63
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:58,869
That's my boy, Bronson.

64
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,741
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

65
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:07,678
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

66
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:12,550
<i>And just like that, our modest</i>
<i>little Sunny Vista Motel...</i>

67
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:17,488
<i>metamorphosized into the</i>
<i>mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.</i>

68
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,906
<i>And for the past 25 years,</i>

69
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,444
<i>it has been lovingly maintained</i>
<i>by my now grown-up son,</i>

<i>Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.</i>

71
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:29,316
<i>Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise
for Skeeter to run the place</i>

72
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,035
<i>- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.</i>

73
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:35,839
<i>my boy always works
diligently with a hopeful heart,</i>

74
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,824
<i>still waiting for his shot.</i>

75
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,644
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

76
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,731
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

77
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:47,284
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

78
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,886
and doesn't want to pay for it.

79
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,805
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

80
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,607
I don't drink alcohol.

81
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,592
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

82
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:58,145
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

83
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,380
He had red hair and a beard.

84
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:03,016
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

85
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:05,369
And he stands about
ten inches tall.

86
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,305
So we're talking
about a leprechaun?

87
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,407
There you go.

88
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,558
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

89
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:14,111
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

90
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:17,230
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

91
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:20,301
Next time you see any
leprechauns, we'll tell Aspen.

92
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:21,501
She's half-troll.

93
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,104
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

94
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:25,872
(SCOFFS)

95
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,291
She would.

96
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:31,912
<i>MARTY: Today magic is</i>
<i>in the air at the grand hotel,</i>

97
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:36,867
<i>and the winds of change are about to blow
our story in a strange new direction.</i>

98
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,086
<i>But what would you expect</i>
<i>in a hotel</i>

99
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:42,440
<i>founded by someone who loved</i>
<i>a good story as much as I?</i>

100
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,491
Time is of the essence
here, Skeeter.

101
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:48,362
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

102
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:49,546
Of course.

103
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:52,699
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,302
- (FEEDBACK)
- Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

105
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:58,289
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

106
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,856
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

107
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,009
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

108
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,727
- Barry.
- ALL: Nottingham.

109
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:05,445
- Barry.
- ALL: Nottingham.

00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:18,917
(APPLAUSE)

116
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,393
Got them warmed up
for you, sir.

117
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:23,030
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

118
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:24,031
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

119
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:26,183
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

120
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:27,551
Not a fear, an awareness...

121
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:30,203
of germs and
how dangerous they can be

122
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:33,991
when not properly...
feared, so...

123
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,227
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

124
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,078
So, yeah,
let me get out of here.

125
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,281
SKEETER:
Barry Nottingham, everybody.

126
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,336
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- BARRY: Welcome.

127
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:51,324
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

128
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,510
But it's no secret
that this one,

129
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:57,181
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

130
00:07:00,234 --> 00:07:03,871
However, this is
a 20th-century hotel.

131
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:07,207
We need something
for the 21st century.

132
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:10,444
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

133
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:15,049
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

134
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,167
(APPLAUSE)

135
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:21,872
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

136
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,200
I simply don't understand what the
fuss is about. It's just a big building.

137
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:28,212
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

138
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:32,516
and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

139
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:35,869
Yes!

140
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,524
So I'm proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

141
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:44,028
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

142
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,931
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

143
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:50,434
how much this hotel
means to him.

144
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:53,937
Take a bow,
Mr. Kendall Duncan!

145
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,273
Take a bow, Kendall.

146
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,326
- God bless.
- Boo!

147
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,894
(HISSING)

148
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,697
MAN: A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

149
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,682
I'm so glad you could come.

150
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,584
It's great to see you.

151
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:08,986
Don't touch me.

152
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,670
Well done, Daddy.

153
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:16,009
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

154
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,828
Only by reputation, sir.

155
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,263
Excuse me?

156
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:22,349
No, no, not that
she has a reputation.

157
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,250
I always heard she's very hot.

158
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,586
Not hot as in hot.

159
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:28,655
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.

160
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:32,376
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

161
00:08:32,476 --> 00:08:35,695
in bars, with a lot
of different guys, and...

162
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,982
That's the old Violet Nottingham,
my friend. Before she met me.

163
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:41,502
Now it's up to me to keep my
pooky-bear out of the spotlight

164
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:45,271
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir? (CHUCKLES)

165
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,408
Violet's off to her private
tennis lesson with Roger Federer.

166
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,061
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

167
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:53,947
Got to say, uh...

168

we play some poker?

- Gambling? I don't think so.

just take walks in the park

It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

271

all the way down the block.

272
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:30,423
Oh. Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

274

this is the hotel
I work for's truck.

275

So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

276

You know, when we were younger and
your mom and I were out on the roof,

1002
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,596
my dad would always tell us
to look at the stars

1003
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:38,633
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

1004
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:41,402
Right over there. Right over there.
Look, look.

1005
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:43,254
To me, that looks like a camel.

1006
00:50:43,355 --> 00:50:45,556
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

1007

Oh, yeah. I see that.

Hey, good one, Patrick.

Look, right next to the moon.
Right, right beside it.

1011
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,451

Um...
Well, that's a tough one.

You're always gonna have
this girl to hang out with.

ever going anywhere.

I'll always be around.

I hope you're happy.

Well, thank you.
Have fun at night school.

See you tomorrow.

1030
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,774
All right, we got rid of her,
so let's get to business.

Put the s'mores down.
Story time.

00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:16,881
All right, guys. Tonight's

1033
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:18,716

- What?
- Boring.

Come on, guys,
I really need you to do this.

1038
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:31,161
It's gonna help
my life a lot. Please?

All right, you know what?

1040
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:35,666
We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

1041
00:52:35,951 --> 00:52:38,269
How about some
Evel Knievel stuff?

Racing, jumping, flying...

1043
00:52:41,906 --> 00:52:44,224

like romantic?

1045
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:47,761

and the romance

1047
