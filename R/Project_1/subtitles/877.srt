1
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,726
Sorry, we can't come
to the phone right now.

2
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,194
If you'll leave a message

3
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:45,729
we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

4
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:46,730
Thanks.

5
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,733
Hi, Mamie. It's Jack.

6
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,735
We're going to leave London
as planned,

7
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,070
but we'll take a cab
from the airport,

8
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,440
so nobody has to bother
to drive in and pick us up.

9
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:58,742
Ah! Eight.

10
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:03,013
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven... Ohh!

11
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,681
You already own that.

12
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,183
You own everything.

13
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,685
I'll put another
hotel on it.

14
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:11,188
...and listen, we completely
forgot about Sally's goldfish.

15
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,890
If by some miracle
they're still alive

16
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:14,691
will you feed them
and change the water, and...

17
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,926
Your turn, Dad.

18
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:18,862
Uh, Mom will make my move,
honey.

19
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,431
And if they're not,
will you go to the store

20
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:25,202
and see if you can find a couple
that are sort of the same size?

21
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,537
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.

22
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,039
One, two, three...

23
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:30,040
What's happening?

24
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,876
...five, six! Yes!

25
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:34,711
Oh, no.

26
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:35,712
Yay!

27
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,713
Another hotel?

28
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:39,232
What does... what does
he owe you?

29
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,403
You owe me
1,000 and 100 pounds.

30
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,405
I haven't got it.
You win.

31
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:46,406
I'm out.

32
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:47,641
This girl is rich.

33
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:48,942
I want to go to sleep.

34
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:02,255
Good evening, sir.

35
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,891
Uh, yes?

36
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,043
Will these do?

37
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:10,080
Uh... yeah. Bring them in.

38
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,250
My wife, I guess.

39
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,872
Ahh...

40
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,375
candles, champagne...

41
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:39,542
Oh, honey.

42
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:43,046
I'm sorry I didn't
think of this.

43
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:44,381
That's all right.

44
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,351
Only one of us had to.

45
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:50,654
Is she asleep?

46
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,721
Mm-hmm.

47
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,017
What about your speech?

48
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,736
I'll wing it.

49
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:07,070
You sure?

50
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:09,506
Mm-hmm.

51
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:12,175
Mmm.

52
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:16,880
<i>We have all watched, I think,</i>

53
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,082
with a sense of awe,
the protean events

54
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,418
which have taken place in
Moscow and the Republics

55
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:26,689
and the enormous changes
resulting from these events.

56
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:28,257
In this volatile climate, then

57
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,760
I must conclude that
we can only speculate

58
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:34,064
on the future of
Soviet fleet development

59
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:35,115
and deployment.

60
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,050
I would like to thank
the trustees

61
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,151
of the Royal Naval Academy

62
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:39,119
for their
very kind invitation

63
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:41,254
to be here with you today.

64
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:48,071
He's impressed, Sally.
He just can't show it.

65
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,272
He's a professional soldier.

66
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,708
It's his job
not to be distracted.

67
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,877
Come on. We got to go
meet Daddy.

68
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:57,564
I'm impressed.

69
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,007
Find it on the map there?

70
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:09,609
Uh-huh. We're right here,

71
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:12,245
and when we get to the street
there, we turn left...

72
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:13,413
No, right.
Yeah, right.

73
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:14,414
You sure?

74
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:15,815
Turn right, yes.

75
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:17,717
Okay, we're going to turn right.
I'm following your map.

76
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,785
Okay, okay, all right.

77
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,267
You mind your
bottom, Paddy-boy.

78
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,885
Move sure and fast.

79
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,737
You told me that, didn't you?

80
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,205
So I'm telling
you again.

81
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,424
This won't be like anything

82
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:44,627
you've ever done before,
little brother.

83
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:47,597
Target leaving the palace now.

84
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:48,715
Right.

85
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,683
Stay awake, lads.
Here they come.

86
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:56,422
Up!

87
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:25,585
Okay right here?

88
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:26,753
That good?

89
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,654
Any more? Little more?

90
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:29,522
Okay.

91
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,007
There's daddy.

92
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:43,720
Go!

93
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:49,676
Down! Get down!

94
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,080
Ready!

95
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:56,733
Get down!

96
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:04,557
Come on!

97
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,043
Oh!

98
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,811
Get down. Keep her down!

99
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,306
Get out of the car!

100
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:21,340
Come on!

101
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:22,608
Get out!

102
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,111
Open the fucking door!

103
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,247
Open it!

104
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:29,382
Jack!

105
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,801
Open it, or I'll blow it off!

106
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:48,151
Come on, let's go!

107
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:50,686
Go! Go! Go!

108
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:59,312
Paddy?

109
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,490
Stop! Army! Drop it!

110
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,708
Grab his arms!

111
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,082
Help the boy.

112
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,954
No, he's had it.

113
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,359
It's all right, sweetie.

114
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:04,460
I want you to stay here.

115
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,529
Everything's
going to be okay.

116
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:11,468
Stand back, please.

117
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,735
Stand back, ma'am.

118
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:13,969
That's my husband.

119
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:17,156
I'm a doctor.
I'm going to treat him.

120
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,991
Oh, Jesus, Jack!

121
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,260
What were you thinking of?

122
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,548
I'm going to
set you down, okay?

123
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,669
Stay with me, Jack.

124
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:32,338
You hear me?
Stay with me.

125
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:33,506
Jack?

126
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:35,174
Jack, stay with me.

127
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,007
The feeling here today
is one of outrage

128
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:54,210
over this unprecedented
terrorist attack

129
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,878
on the Royal Family.

130
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,897
And while no group
has yet claimed credit,

131
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:01,367
there is, among many here,
speculation already

132
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,286
of Irish Republican Army
involvement.

133
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:05,288
According
to eyewitness accounts,

134
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,124
Lord William Holmes,
the Queen Mother's cousin

135
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,626
and Minister of State
for Northern Ireland,

136
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,461
along with his wife and son,

137
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,963
would have most certainly
been killed

138
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,832
were it not for the heroic
efforts of this man--

139
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,402
John Patrick Ryan,
the American tourist

140
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,656
who broke up
the assassination attempt.

141
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:24,874
An author and professor

142
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:27,410
at the United States
Naval Academy

143
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:28,811
in Annapolis, Maryland,

144
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,481
Ryan is a former
Marine lieutenant.

145
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,417
Wounded in
the exchange of gunfire,

146
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,435
he is listed
in guarded condition

147
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:39,005
at an undisclosed
London hospital.

148
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,341
This is Deborah Weston,
CNN news, London.

149
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,494
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:04,463
It's all right.

151
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:06,465
You're alive.
I forgive you.

152
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:08,133
Otherwise...

153
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,458
Hey, pumpkin.

154
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,798
I love you.

155
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,635
I love you, too.

156
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:38,148
You dignify their cowardice
with your silence.

157
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:39,482
They left you.

158
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:42,818
They drove off without you.

159
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:47,657
I'm curious as to what it is
you think you owe them.

160
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,659
If any of my mates
ever drove off

161
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:51,827
and left me in your hands,

162
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,680
I'd not only feel no
great sense of loyalty,

163
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:57,951
I'd make sure to remind meself
to kill them.

164
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,337
Who are they, Sean?

165
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,624
Where are they?

166
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:10,830
The trip was unscheduled.

167
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:14,334
How'd you know Lord Holmes
would be there?

168
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:27,780
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, you know.

169
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:40,493
I'd tear your heart out

170
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,829
and serve it up
to you with chips

171
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:45,164
if I didn't know
you'd enjoy it,

172
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,833
you Fenian bastard.

173
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,744
<i>No. Not in all eternity.</i>

174
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,046
He'll not chirp a word.

175
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:01,547
Not Sean Miller...

176
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,216
and not while his brother
is lying on a slab.

177
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:09,889
What's the matter, Jimmy?

178
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,290
Don't you
believe it?

179
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,692
It's the entire thing
I don't believe.

180
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,778
The royal family, Kevin?

181
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:18,781
You know that only
turns people against us.

182
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,506
Look, this was
totally unauthorized,

183
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:31,176
and the other
brigade commanders,

184
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,428
they know that
you were behind it.

185
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:33,796
Fuck the bloody IRA.

186
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:35,130
All these
years of war,

187
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:37,099
and they've got
us nowhere.

188
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,302
In its heart and soul,

189
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,304
England is still a monarchy,

190
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,306
and that is where
we must strike--

191
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:45,808
at the royals
and the ruling class.

192
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:51,781
You're either with us
or you're against us, Jimmy-boy.

193
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:56,519
Make up your mind.

194
00:15:58,304 --> 00:15:59,839
Oh, I'm with you.

195
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,474
Good.

196
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,610
That's all I wanted to hear.

197
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,770
I'll leave you to it.

198
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:16,606
Kevin...

199
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,975
Charlie's going
to drop by tonight

200
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:22,445
to try to straighten
things out.

201
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:23,946
Be smart.

202
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:25,948
Talk to him.

203
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,783
And hold your temper.

204
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,971
I promise.

205
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,272
Thanks, Jimmy.

206
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,417
Kevin.

207
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,847
Kevin, lad...

208
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,249
it's me, Charlie.

209
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,876
That's me holding my temper,
Jimmy-boy.

210
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,955
Oh, God.

211
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:47,523
Oh, yeah.

212
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,858
All right.

213
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:54,981
All right.

214
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:58,801
Oh, yeah.

215
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:06,575
Oh, damn!

216
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:07,576
What?

217
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:08,577
I forgot.

218
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:10,246
What?

219
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,848
Where's my bag?

220
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,451
You're not going to make me
wear a rubber, are you?

221
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:17,286
You know, the Church says

222
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:19,655
wearing one of them's
a sin, darlin'.

223
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:20,939
So is this...

224
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:22,208
darlin'.

225
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:01,664
So what can you
tell me about, uh...

226
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:03,331
about this guy?

227
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,953
Sean? Oh, he's a nice boy,
Sean Miller.

228
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,188
Shot a parish priest
in Derry...

229
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:11,741
during confession,
if you can imagine.

230
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:13,576
He thought the Father
was informing for the British.

231
00:20:13,643 --> 00:20:14,976
Excuse me, Sergeant.

232
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:16,745
I don't think it's in
Mr. Ryan's best interests

233
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:19,648
or the prosecution's
to discuss matters

234
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:22,834
not directly related
to the events at hand.

235
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,536
If you can
confirm for me

236
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,538
that the man in
that photograph

237
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:29,642
is the same man you
disarmed in the square,

238
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,877
I think we'll
be through.

239
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:34,813
I can.

240
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,800
Do you have anything
to add, Mr. Ryan?

241
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:38,968
Yes.

242
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:39,968
Uh...

243
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:41,970
the man I killed was Miller's...

244
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:43,171
Brother.

245
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,006
Brother.

246
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:45,140
Patrick.

247
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,410
Not even 17,
Paddy-boy.

248
00:20:48,478 --> 00:20:49,778
Recruited by Sean
into the IRA...

249
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:50,862
Again, I think we'd
all be better served

250
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,431
if we could preserve

251
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,450
the clarity of your
eventual testimony.

252
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:55,818
I read it in the newspaper.

253
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:56,953
I can hardly see...

254
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,821
I'd appreciate
you refraining

255
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,072
from reading
the newspapers.

256
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,240
<i>Not even Doonesbury?</i>

257
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:03,408
Well...

258
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:05,510
do you have
anything to add?

259
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,396
No.

260
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,924
Mr. Ryan?

261
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:35,925
Yes.

262
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:37,259
My name's Jeffrey Watkins,

263
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:38,427
principal private
secretary to Lord Holmes.

264
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:39,661
It's a pleasure to meet you.

265
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,163
This is my wife, Catherine.

266
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:42,164
How do you do?

267
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:43,465
Hello.

268
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:44,934
So, Dr. Ryan, how is
your patient healing?

269
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,135
Just fine.

270
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:48,103
We're looking forward
to going home, though.

271
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:49,338
I can imagine.

272
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:51,340
May I introduce
his Lordship?

273
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:52,774
Oh, hello.

274
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:55,945
It's my great honor
to finally meet you, Dr. Ryan.

275
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:56,946
Thank you.

276
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,114
I owe you a debt of gratitude

277
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:01,683
that I shall never
be able to repay.

278
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,085
Not at all. Thank you
for your kind note.

279
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:18,867
I'm delighted
that you're here

280
00:22:18,935 --> 00:22:21,370
to share in the
good news, Mrs. Ryan.

281
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:23,739
Her Majesty's decided
to invest

282
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,241
your husband KCVO--

283
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:29,912
Knight Commander
of the Victorian Order.

284
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:32,415
My congratulations, Sir.

285
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:33,416
Thank you.

286
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:34,917
Good luck today.

287
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:40,923
Sir Jack?

288
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,426
Lady Catherine.

289
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:55,688
Perhaps if I'd had
more time to think about it,

290
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,123
I would've preferred
to do something else.

291
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,591
So you're saying

292
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:00,826
you didn't have time,
is that it?

293
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:01,827
That's correct.

294
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:04,062
So you didn't.

295
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,230
Didn't what?

296
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:06,231
Think, sir.

297
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,733
You didn't think,

298
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:11,069
is the point I believe
you're trying to make.

299
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:14,390
No. Instead you raced
into a situation

300
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:17,058
of which, by
your own admission,

301
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:20,228
you had no understanding,

302
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:23,081
attacked my client, who was,
in fact, another pedestrian

303
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:24,466
hurrying to help.

304
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,435
Wearing a ski mask.

305
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:28,587
Shot a second man in the chest,

306
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:29,822
this one taking you--
can it be...?

307
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,856
After they shot me.

308
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,858
...three shots at
point-blank range

309
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,360
in order to fell
the second victim.

310
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:37,496
I used that force
I deemed necessary.

311
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:40,482
I should say so.

312
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,017
I doubt very much

313
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:44,519
whether anyone in this
courtroom would disagree.

314
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:45,921
Excuse me.

315
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,639
I didn't make this happen, sir.

316
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,107
No further questions.

317
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:50,692
He did.

318
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,530
Oh, My Lord, there is
one more question.

319
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:59,768
Are you still, Dr. Ryan,
in the paid service

320
00:23:59,836 --> 00:24:01,386
of the Central
Intelligence Agency?

321
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:03,922
I should remind you
that you're under oath.

322
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,427
No.

323
00:24:08,494 --> 00:24:10,128
I beg your pardon?

324
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:12,080
No.

325
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:15,151
That's all.

326
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:16,885
Thank you.

327
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:18,687
The witness may stand down.

328
00:24:18,755 --> 00:24:20,389
Thank you very much.

329
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:23,942
Thank you.

330
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,511
Gentlemen, I think this might be

331
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,247
an appropriate moment...

332
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:30,799
Bloody proud of yourself,
aren't you?

333
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:34,069
You stuck your nose in
where it didn't belong,

334
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:36,872
and now you've killed
my baby brother.

335
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:26,621
Hey, Daddy!

336
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:27,822
Hey, pumpkin.

337
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Hey.

338
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:40,852
Wow! You guys
have really grown.

339
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:08,813
How are you feeling?

340
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,649
Not so good.

341
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:12,151
Tired?

342
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:13,318
No.

343
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,654
I have no idea
what time it is.

344
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,989
Feels like morning to me.

345
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:19,491
You're telling me.

346
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,196
Did I miss something?

347
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:25,580
No...

348
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:28,450
but I did.

349
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:34,189
I'm pregnant.

350
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,593
Honey!

351
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:43,615
Can I watch some TV?

352
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:45,617
I'm not at all tired.

353
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,005
What?

354
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:55,393
Plates.

355
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,362
I don't have any
say in this, do I?

356
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,531
Sure, you do, honey.
This is a family.

357
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,615
Everybody's got a say.

358
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:02,817
But my say's after the fact.

359
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,053
Or am I wrong?

360
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:06,488
No...

361
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:07,555
you're right.

362
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:12,060
Michaela really despises
her little sister.

363
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:13,061
Yeah?

364
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:14,329
Well...

365
00:27:14,331 --> 00:27:16,665
Are you ready for this?
It could be even worse.

366
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:18,667
It could be a baby brother.

367
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:20,502
Oh, no. Boys.

368
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,604
I mean, do you refer to
these fighting men as terrorists?

369
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:23,706
No. You call them patriots.

370
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:24,707
Jack.

371
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:26,508
Boys are...

372
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:29,578
Do you, in fact, deny that the
Provisional Wing of the IRA

373
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,413
was behind
this assassination attempt?

374
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:34,483
When the IRA
carry out any form of campaign,

375
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:35,484
they admit to it.

376
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,652
Thank you.

377
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,003
That's the policy.

378
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:40,806
They'll proudly
say they did it.

379
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:43,425
Have the IRA admitted to this?

380
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,927
I mean,
common sense, logic,

381
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:46,795
some form of reason...

382
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:48,430
May I at least suggest
some names?

383
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:49,998
Some think your efforts in
America raising money

384
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,266
for the Irish cause
will be affected...

385
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,269
Sure, you can, honey.

386
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,476
Good morning, Mr. Cooley.

387
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,797
And to you, madam.

388
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:39,915
How is business?

389
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:41,917
Fine, thank you.

390
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:45,187
I came upon this first edition
at an estate auction.

391
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:47,455
Can your man restore it?

392
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:52,428
And when would you
want this by, madam?

393
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:53,762
Soon.

394
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:57,999
As you can see,
it's very pressing.

395
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:02,253
I'm not sure. The binder may
have some trouble with this.

396
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,855
Is that so?

397
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:05,924
I'll see what I can do.

398
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:08,426
He's not a miracle
worker, you know.

399
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:11,346
No, obviously
he's not, Mr. Cooley.

400
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,752
The best you can arrange, then.

401
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:20,405
Good day, Mr. Cooley.

402
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:22,106
Good day, madam.

403
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:37,438
Hello, Sean.

404
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:40,441
Don't mind if I come
along with you, do you?

405
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,491
Although I disapprove

406
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,994
of the things
you've done, Sean,

407
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:36,197
I can't quite bring
meself to condemn ya.

408
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:43,838
I can't...

409
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:45,340
because I understand

410
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:47,476
where the hatred comes from.

411
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:52,314
I more than
understand it.

412
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:56,168
But the present fact is
that we're very near now

413
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:59,037
the darkest hole
in all of Great Britain,

414
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:02,974
and you still
won't speak to me.

415
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:31,153
They're raising the bridge.

416
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,721
We'll be here
about five minutes.

417
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:35,007
Understood.

418
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:58,263
Mobile Three,
Lymington.

419
00:31:58,314 --> 00:31:59,748
Hello, Lymington!

420
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:01,766
They jammed
the radio.

421
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:14,495
Open the door!

422
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,765
Open it, or
I'll kill him.

423
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:17,983
They've got the bridge keeper.

424
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:18,984
What do we do?

425
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:20,585
We open the door.
Open it!

426
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,320
But for Christ's sake...!

427
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,321
But what?

428
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,323
Wait until they kill him,

429
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,425
then open the door?

430
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,184
Your guns!

431
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,086
We are unarmed.

432
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:40,705
Just who the hell are you?

433
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,007
Get them out!

434
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:49,297
Get your heads down!

435
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:51,116
Lay down on
the bloody ground!

436
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:52,801
Don't you fucking move!

437
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:55,470
Didn't think we'd
forget about you, did you?

438
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,078
Inspector Robert Highland,

439
00:33:04,146 --> 00:33:06,581
this is a
friend of mine.

440
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,049
We meet at
last, Mr. Highland.

441
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:11,486
Tell me, what do they pay you

442
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:13,855
to turn against
your own people, eh?

443
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:16,958
Get on with it
and be on your way.

444
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:21,045
Very well, if that's the
way you feel about it.

445
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:13,982
Come on, Cath!

446
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,471
Have I got the tickets,
or what?

447
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:21,973
I don't have them.

448
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,474
I don't have them.

449
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:25,176
They're on the fridge.

450
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:26,461
Dad...

451
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:28,613
Honey, there's plenty of time.

452
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:00,996
Hello, Admiral.

453
00:35:01,063 --> 00:35:02,497
Good morning, Jack.

454
00:35:02,564 --> 00:35:03,965
You know Marty Cantor.

455
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:04,933
Marty.

456
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,135
How's the shoulder?

457
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:08,119
Not too bad.

458
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,442
Something's come up.

459
00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:16,445
Can we sit down
and have a chat?

460
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:22,100
They were moving him to
Albany Prison on the Isle of Wight

461
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:23,801
when it happened.

462
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,104
We think
he's left the country.

463
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:28,540
Marty, excuse me.
Let's deal in what we know,

464
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:29,941
and not what we don't.

465
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:31,443
We know he's escaped.

466
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,911
We know it happened in Kent
near the Channel.

467
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,914
If he's left the country--

468
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:38,182
Jack, you listening?--

469
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,819
the chances he'd come here,
that he'd try

470
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:44,489
that he could come here
are so remote,

471
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:46,591
I have trouble
even saying it.

472
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:48,476
And yet your first instinct

473
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:51,012
was to come all the way out here
and tell me.

474
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:56,000
Marty, want to excuse us
a few minutes?

475
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,581
I've got a few more weeks
before school starts,

476
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:30,585
but I've got to... dig in
and prepare a few lectures.

477
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:34,405
Want to come down
and look over what we got?

478
00:36:34,473 --> 00:36:37,158
You might turn up
something we haven't.

479
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:40,528
You're asking me
if I want to come back.

480
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,330
Yup.

481
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,707
We'll try and go
next week, honey.

482
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:53,708
All right.

483
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:54,876
Sorry.

484
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,947
Sean Miller escaped.

485
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:03,885
Well, what does that mean?

486
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:07,505
They just wanted me to know.

487
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,008
They thought I might
be concerned. I'm not.

488
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:11,509
The IRA's not stupid.

489
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,311
They're not going to
follow me all the way over here.

490
00:37:13,379 --> 00:37:15,496
We talked about it.
They agreed.

491
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:16,998
They're gone. That's it.

492
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:21,035
They didn't ask you
to come back to CIA?

493
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:24,421
I said no.

494
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,391
Just like that.

495
00:37:29,745 --> 00:37:31,846
I don't want
to go back, honey.

496
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:38,920
I saw them coming,
and I just...

497
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:40,088
I know.

498
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,660
I can't go back to that
life again... you know?

499
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,252
Sally! Wait up, honey.

500
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:18,510
I bet your cell was
even better than this--

501
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:20,512
the bloody Ritz in comparison.

502
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,515
At least you always had your
own toilet bowl, eh, Sean?

503
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:24,849
Come on, Sean, cheer up.

504
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:27,018
You've just been spared
a lifetime of hell on earth.

505
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:30,021
A word of gratitude
might even be in order.

506
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:32,023
I don't feel
like resting,

507
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:35,527
laying around in the sun like
some complacent tourist.

508
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:39,030
If we're to build an army, we've
got to train like soldiers,

509
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:41,533
and we can't do that
in Ireland. Not now.

510
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,068
Bleeding waste of time.

511
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:45,937
There's laying about,
and there's laying low.

512
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:47,038
There's a difference.

513
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:49,140
Is there?

514
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,008
It's Lord Holmes who should be
worried about complacency.

515
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:52,210
Next time he won't be so lucky.

516
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:55,412
Post him back to Whitehall
in little pieces

517
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,647
if that's what it takes

518
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:59,934
to free every Irish
political prisoner.

519
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:02,303
That's not who
I'm thinking of.

520
00:39:02,371 --> 00:39:05,056
I know that, Sean, but what Ryan
done can't be undone,

521
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,725
so you should stop
thinking about him.

522
00:39:10,295 --> 00:39:11,596
I can't.

523
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:23,908
How in the world could something
like this have happened?

524
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,910
Inspector Highland
picked the day,

525
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:28,413
picked the decoy routes,
picked the men,

526
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,914
and still they knew.

527
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,916
He had two children,
apparently.

528
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,918
It's tragic, tragic.

529
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:36,854
SO-13 have narrowed it down
to 31 people who had prior

530
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:39,791
knowledge of your itinerary
on the day of the attack

531
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:41,392
and of Miller's transfer,

532
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,611
five of whom are now dead.

533
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,047
Sir, I think it
might be best if we limit

534
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:48,749
your appointments
for the time being.

535
00:39:48,817 --> 00:39:51,619
I will not have my itinerary
dictated to me

536
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:53,504
by terrorists.

537
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,007
Whoever this traitor is,

538
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,577
they better pray to God
I never find him.

539
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:02,580
We know you'll do
your best, Sergeant.

540
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:21,882
...You got to backstroke,
sidestroke to get to shore,

541
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,919
<i>You got to backstroke,
sidestroke to get to shore,</i>

542
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:27,405
And we don't know
if we're ever coming home,

543
00:40:27,473 --> 00:40:30,241
<i>And we don't know
if we're ever coming home,</i>

544
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:33,210
Stand up, buckle up,
shuffle through the door,

545
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:36,146
<i>Stand up, buckle up,
shuffle through the door,</i>

546
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:39,216
Jump on out and shout
Marine Corps...

547
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:42,036
Egesta appealed to
Athens on what basis?

548
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:44,606
On what grounds?

549
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,474
Mr. Viederman?

550
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,509
Bad time for you?

551
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:53,180
Well, uh, they...
said they'd be grateful

552
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,282
didn't they?

553
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,534
Uh-huh. Yeah.

554
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:57,802
Um...

555
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,036
Mm-hmm.

556
00:40:59,104 --> 00:41:01,171
"Fight our battle,
and the rest of the world

557
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,107
will fear and respect you."

558
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,742
Yeah, but didn't
the rest of the world

559
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:06,444
fear and respect Athens already?

560
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:07,228
It didn't matter.

561
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:08,196
It didn't matter.
Why not?

562
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:09,630
Pride, sir?

563
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:12,917
That's the battle they lost.
The real battle.

564
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:14,551
Attention on deck!

565
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:17,722
Attention to orders.

566
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,541
I have a presentation
to make.

567
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:23,845
For service above and beyond
the call of duty

568
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:26,547
of a tourist,
even a Marine...

569
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:30,801
we recognize Professor
John Patrick Ryan

570
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:33,537
with the Order of
the Purple Target

571
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:36,524
and hope that he
will duck next time,

572
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:38,926
lest he become part of history

573
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:41,695
rather than a teacher of it.

574
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:50,638
How old is he?

575
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:51,739
Ten.

576
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,340
Plate glass window?

577
00:41:53,408 --> 00:41:54,642
Mm-hmm.

578
00:41:58,213 --> 00:42:00,381
Here we go.

579
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:01,382
Hi, guys.

580
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:02,817
Good morning, Cathy.

581
00:42:05,153 --> 00:42:08,089
Hmm. I've got
a retina at 1:00.

582
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:10,592
We might have to bump it.

583
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:12,594
This could take some time.

584
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:14,095
Yep, let's bump it.

585
00:42:14,162 --> 00:42:16,097
We're all set to go.

586
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:17,599
Okay, let's do it.

587
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,753
So you just waded on in
like John Wayne.

588
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:25,623
Why did you do it?

589
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:27,625
What were you thinking, man?

590
00:42:30,195 --> 00:42:31,629
I don't know.

591
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:33,131
I wasn't thinking.

592
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:34,899
That's it?

593
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,385
You sound like
some of my students.

594
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:45,626
Just pissed me off.

595
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:48,145
I couldn't just stand
there and watch them

596
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:51,382
shoot those people
right in front of me.

597
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,219
It was... rage.

598
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,323
Pure rage.

599
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:05,329
It just made me mad.

600
00:43:05,397 --> 00:43:08,483
Here's hoping you
never get mad at me, man.

601
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:17,241
Oh...

602
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,034
Okay, now it's my turn.

603
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:29,704
She's late, Sean.

604
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,058
Yeah, and then what?

605
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,393
And she was at this dance,

606
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,628
Yeah?
and then this guy,

607
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:56,563
at the end, he...

608
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:58,399
Eww!

609
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:02,636
Kind of cute, isn't she?

610
00:44:02,704 --> 00:44:04,238
Is she?

611
00:44:13,598 --> 00:44:15,365
Bye. See ya.

612
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:18,085
Hi, Mommy.

613
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:21,188
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

614
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:22,907
Let's do it.

615
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:28,729
Goddamn!

616
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:31,365
Whoa! Not here.

617
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:47,832
Highway 50. West.

618
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,058
Good night, Doc.

619
00:44:58,126 --> 00:44:59,093
Good night.

620
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:37,141
Dr. Ryan!

621
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:38,843
Clear the way!

622
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:48,803
Where's Sean Miller?

623
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,122
Where's Sean Miller?

624
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:54,241
Dr. Ryan, get out
of the way, please!

625
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:56,127
Dr. Ryan!

626
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,606
This is surgery.

627
00:47:08,674 --> 00:47:10,240
Yeah, Dr. Catherine Ryan,
please.

628
00:47:10,308 --> 00:47:12,577
Dr. Ryan, Dr. Ryan,
are you all right?

629
00:47:12,644 --> 00:47:13,578
She's left for the day.

630
00:47:13,645 --> 00:47:14,579
How long?

631
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:15,713
Dr. Ryan.

632
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:18,583
Come on!

633
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:19,951
Come on!

634
00:47:43,157 --> 00:47:44,942
Surgery.

635
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,961
Yes. This is Dr. Ryan.

636
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,462
I'd like the results

637
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,965
on the Thompson boy's
retinal scan.

638
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,299
Hold, please.

639
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,604
Come on, Cathy,
get off the phone.

640
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:08,615
Look, Mom.

641
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,117
Ooh, it's beautiful.

642
00:48:10,185 --> 00:48:11,919
Are you still holding?

643
00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:13,888
Yes, I'm still holding.

644
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:17,157
Look, I'd like to speak
with Dr. Sutton.

645
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:38,312
Operator, I want to make
an emergency breakthrough.

646
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,882
The number is 555-3464.

647
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,918
Yeah, it's a mobile phone, yeah.

648
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:46,520
What do you mean I can't?

649
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:53,377
Faster, damn it!

650
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:09,309
Come on, Cath.

651
00:49:09,377 --> 00:49:10,561
Watch it, buddy!

652
00:49:13,165 --> 00:49:15,900
Dr. Ryan, we have the results
of that retinal scan,

653
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:17,068
and everything is fine.

654
00:49:17,135 --> 00:49:18,836
That's great. Thank you.

655
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:26,477
Jesus!

656
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,487
Hello.

657
00:49:36,554 --> 00:49:37,554
Cathy.

658
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:38,856
Jack?

659
00:49:38,923 --> 00:49:41,092
Cath, something's
happened, honey.

660
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,960
Is Sally with you?

661
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:43,711
Yeah.

662
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:44,712
Hi, Dad!

663
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,079
Is everything all right?

664
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:47,448
Yeah, everything's fine.

665
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:51,385
There she is.

666
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:52,586
Right.

667
00:49:55,957 --> 00:49:57,108
Honey, I want you
to get off the highway

668
00:49:57,175 --> 00:49:59,193
and get to the nearest
police station

669
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,227
as quick as you can, all right?

670
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:01,729
The police station?

671
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:04,898
Cathy, just get
off the highway right now.

672
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:09,953
Steady, mate.

673
00:50:10,021 --> 00:50:11,121
Steady.

674
00:50:13,124 --> 00:50:14,324
Where are you now?

675
00:50:14,392 --> 00:50:15,826
I'm at Rowe Boulevard.

676
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:18,328
There's a State Police
barracks at Houston Street.

677
00:50:18,396 --> 00:50:19,429
I'll meet you there.

678
00:50:19,497 --> 00:50:21,165
Okay.

679
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:22,499
Is something
wrong, Mom?

680
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,902
No. Everything's fine.
It's okay.

681
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,742
They're gone.

682
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:42,246
I got it!

683
00:51:42,248 --> 00:51:43,313
Coming in!

684
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:11,775
Mr. Ryan?

685
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:12,976
Yeah.

686
00:52:15,597 --> 00:52:17,014
Your wife's okay.

687
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:18,015
She sustained a concussion,

688
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,016
but we ran a complete skull...

689
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:20,017
She's pregnant.

690
00:52:20,085 --> 00:52:21,318
I know.

691
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:22,886
The baby's okay.
You don't have to worry...

692
00:52:22,954 --> 00:52:24,121
What about my daughter?

693
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:26,523
Let's sit down for a moment.

694
00:52:26,591 --> 00:52:28,175
No. Talk to me.

695
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:31,612
It's going to be
a little while before we know,

696
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,714
maybe in the morning.

697
00:52:33,782 --> 00:52:36,283
<i>She, uh...</i>

698
00:52:54,802 --> 00:52:56,770
Where's Sally?

699
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:01,659
She's in the recovery room,
honey.

700
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:03,594
They're watching her.

701
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:07,297
We'll know in seven
or eight hours.

702
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:12,219
They had to remove
her spleen.

703
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:14,821
She's in pretty bad shape.

704
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:19,259
I'm sorry.

705
00:54:01,986 --> 00:54:03,420
Harry Johnson is standing by.

706
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:05,305
In a few moments,
he expects to have a statement

707
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:06,673
from Mr. Paddy O'Neil.

708
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:08,075
Mr. O'Neil is the Sinn Fein
representative...

709
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:10,077
Jack.

710
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:11,578
Here you go.

711
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:13,180
You okay?

712
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:23,106
And now we go
to Harry Johnson

713
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:26,109
ready to speak
with Mr. Paddy O'Neil.

714
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:28,111
I've come to stand vigil

715
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:30,647
and to pray for the recovery

716
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:33,116
of the victims
of this senseless attack.

717
00:54:33,184 --> 00:54:35,718
Sinn Fein are outraged,

718
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:38,721
as indeed are most
Irish Catholics this morning

719
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:40,623
at this heinous crime.

720
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:45,295
Look, I want to share
with Dr. Ryan, personally,

721
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:46,613
our empathy and anguish,

722
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,448
but I will wait
as I feel it proper

723
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:50,167
for the most
appropriate time.

724
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,268
Can you confirm or deny

725
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:52,819
that funding
for the IRA...?

726
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:55,455
The IRA are not
responsible for this attack.

727
00:54:55,523 --> 00:54:56,890
What you're saying is

728
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,292
the IRA had nothing
to do with this incident?

729
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,794
Uh, no more questions.

730
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,295
Thank you, Mr. O'Neil.

731
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:10,270
She's going to be okay.

732
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:11,438
Thank you.

733
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:16,409
She's all right.
She's all right.

734
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,347
Ryan.

735
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:23,383
Mr. Ryan.

736
00:55:25,152 --> 00:55:27,988
Mr. Ryan, I'd like
to share with you

737
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:29,773
our deep regret about...

738
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:33,610
No bullet wounds.

739
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:34,878
Mr. Ryan.

740
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,113
Cathy Ryan's
concussion is mild, however.

741
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:40,233
We expect her to be released
within two to three days.

742
00:56:15,753 --> 00:56:18,088
You know the deal, Jack.
Come on, you are involved.

743
00:56:18,156 --> 00:56:20,423
Marty, don't tell me about the deal.
I know the deal.

744
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:21,557
That is not good process.

745
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:22,926
You are the victim of a crime,

746
00:56:22,994 --> 00:56:23,481
I...

747
00:56:23,507 --> 00:56:25,453
and that does not make
for the best analysis

748
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:27,697
even if you knew something
about terrorism,

749
00:56:27,765 --> 00:56:29,032
which you do not.

750
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,200
I have guys on it

751
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:31,835
guys who know something
about the IRA.

752
00:56:31,903 --> 00:56:33,236
Marty, I am not standing here...

753
00:56:33,304 --> 00:56:34,737
This is not Naval intelligence.

754
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:36,940
Marty, I am not standing here
with my hat in my hand.

755
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:39,943
I am telling you,
I want back in.

756
00:56:40,011 --> 00:56:41,111
Jack.

757
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:42,279
Sir.

758
00:56:42,346 --> 00:56:43,780
Thank God about Sally.

759
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:45,015
Thank you.

760
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:48,051
Alice and I
are relieved beyond words.

761
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,436
You manage any sleep?

762
00:56:49,504 --> 00:56:52,171
Not much, sir.

763
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:54,108
I'm interrupting something.

764
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:56,110
You were explaining to Jack

765
00:56:56,177 --> 00:56:58,878
about how we'd be better off

766
00:56:58,946 --> 00:57:01,081
without him
around here...

767
00:57:01,149 --> 00:57:03,700
or something
along those lines.

768
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:16,596
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan.

769
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:18,065
Nice to meet you.

770
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:19,066
Tony Ferro.

771
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:20,400
Hi.

772
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:21,568
Alex Winter.

773
00:57:21,636 --> 00:57:23,403
Jack.
Nice to meet you, Alex.

774
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,072
Well.

775
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,573
Rose.

776
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:28,742
I have to say you're looking
better than I expected.

777
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,244
It's an illusion, I'm afraid.

778
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:32,746
Of course it would have
to be, wouldn't it?

779
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:34,547
Well, it's good to see
you again regardless.

780
00:57:34,615 --> 00:57:35,715
You, too.

781
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:37,851
Look, we've carved
a niche for you,

782
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:39,753
and here's your
night-table reading.

783
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:42,022
Oh, my.

784
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:29,202
"Father killed by RUC."

785
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:33,506
"Belfast. 1979."

786
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:38,045
This way.

787
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:39,479
Over here.

788
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:42,315
Good morning, sir.

789
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:43,817
Cut the engine, please.

790
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:46,953
Can I see some form
of identification, please?

791
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:12,980
Did you see the game, then?

792
00:59:13,047 --> 00:59:14,081
Yeah. It was all right.

793
00:59:14,148 --> 00:59:16,049
That penalty...

794
01:00:02,096 --> 01:00:04,748
What the hell?
Hey! Hey! Hey!

795
01:00:04,815 --> 01:00:06,199
Nobody move!

796
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:08,135
Get them up!

797
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,540
Morning.

798
01:00:15,176 --> 01:00:16,927
Kevin O'Donnell,

799
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:18,628
longtime IRA strategist,

800
01:00:18,696 --> 01:00:20,030
friend of the Miller family.

801
01:00:20,097 --> 01:00:22,699
He was there when
Timothy Miller was killed, '79.

802
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:25,952
Looked after his boys,
Sean and Patrick.

803
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,537
This photo's
not a year old.

804
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:29,539
I think if we could
find O'Donnell,

805
01:00:29,607 --> 01:00:32,041
we'll find Miller
still standing at his side.

806
01:00:32,109 --> 01:00:33,543
Are you with me? Jack?

807
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:35,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm just thinking.

808
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:37,747
What about the gun?
What about it?

809
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:40,483
Think it's going
to turn up registered?

810
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:41,984
Son of a bitch.

811
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:44,153
What?

812
01:00:44,221 --> 01:00:46,155
Um...

813
01:00:46,223 --> 01:00:47,924
Look, um...

814
01:00:50,227 --> 01:00:52,161
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip

815
01:00:52,229 --> 01:00:55,799
about some bomb-like stuff
on a table in an apartment.

816
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:57,801
They go in, and they get
some IRA bad guys,

817
01:00:57,868 --> 01:00:59,168
they look around,
and they see there's no way

818
01:00:59,236 --> 01:01:00,169
anybody could have seen
through the window

819
01:01:00,237 --> 01:01:01,671
like the tipster said.

820
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:06,993
We got three IRA hit men
at a farmhouse

821
01:01:07,061 --> 01:01:08,528
hit by somebody else.

822
01:01:08,595 --> 01:01:11,497
That's British soldiers
getting out of hand, Jack.

823
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:12,415
They're not above it,

824
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:13,817
not after a hit
on the royal family.

825
01:01:13,884 --> 01:01:15,384
No, no, no, no, look.

826
01:01:15,386 --> 01:01:18,238
We got Brigade Commander
of the IRA, Jimmy O'Reardon

827
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:19,906
who checks into
a cheap hotel room,

828
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:21,157
ends up dead.

829
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:24,410
Double tap to the head--
very professional.

830
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:26,196
And that was... how long
after the farmhouse?

831
01:01:26,264 --> 01:01:27,363
Same day.

832
01:01:27,431 --> 01:01:28,531
Same day.

833
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:31,034
What are you
coming to, Jack?

834
01:01:35,706 --> 01:01:37,007
Jack!

835
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:39,125
Where are you going?

836
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:42,429
I'm just going to go
throw some water on my face.

837
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:08,321
Jack!

838
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:43,289
Excuse me.

839
01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:47,644
I, uh, think one of us
is in the wrong room.

840
01:02:47,711 --> 01:02:48,744
I'm sorry.

841
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:49,812
That's okay.

842
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:20,543
Jack!

843
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:23,213
Get down!

844
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,715
When the IRA carry
out any form of campaign,

845
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:27,017
they admit to it.

846
01:03:27,084 --> 01:03:28,418
Get down!

847
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,203
I mean, common sense, logic...

848
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:33,406
Get down! Get down!

849
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,965
We didn't get any prints
or anything like that.

850
01:03:42,032 --> 01:03:44,467
Listen, who are
we looking for here, huh?

851
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,135
IRA terrorists

852
01:03:46,203 --> 01:03:49,138
or some ultraviolent
faction of the IRA

853
01:03:49,206 --> 01:03:51,641
fighting the cause their way?

854
01:03:51,709 --> 01:03:53,142
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,478
Jimmy O'Reardon
checked into a hotel

856
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:57,981
with a woman with long hair,

857
01:03:58,048 --> 01:04:00,650
long red hair.

858
01:04:00,718 --> 01:04:03,486
This is who
we should be looking for.

859
01:04:03,553 --> 01:04:07,223
We find her, we'll find him.

860
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:05,065
I saw his wife
and daughter die,

861
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:08,151
but she and Neddie blew it.

862
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:09,669
Ryan's still alive.

863
01:05:12,056 --> 01:05:14,223
They're not dead, Sean.

864
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,324
What?

865
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:16,826
They survived it.

866
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:20,296
I can't say it any
plainer than that.

867
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:21,781
It doesn't matter.

868
01:05:21,848 --> 01:05:23,783
The trip served its purpose.

869
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,668
It does matter.

870
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,614
Sean, Americans
hold their breath

871
01:05:38,682 --> 01:05:42,101
every time a little girl falls
down a pipe in a backyard,

872
01:05:42,169 --> 01:05:45,171
but you've shot at one
with a submachine gun

873
01:05:45,173 --> 01:05:46,155
on her way back
from school.

874
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:48,407
Well, we've started
the bleeding war.

875
01:05:48,475 --> 01:05:50,543
The Brits
are tearing apart Belfast

876
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:52,044
for the IRA,

877
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:54,914
and their American money are
denying the hits so loud,

878
01:05:54,981 --> 01:05:57,466
it only makes them
look more guilty.

879
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:58,635
The war is raging,

880
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:00,369
and when it's over,

881
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:02,888
we'll be the only ones
left standing.

882
01:06:02,956 --> 01:06:05,808
Sean, I let you go
for Paddy-boy,

883
01:06:05,876 --> 01:06:07,376
but that's it.

884
01:06:09,479 --> 01:06:11,915
We've got work to do,

885
01:06:11,982 --> 01:06:13,966
and it's not
in Maryland.

886
01:06:47,134 --> 01:06:48,267
Hello.

887
01:07:20,367 --> 01:07:21,801
Yeah.

888
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:24,637
<i>How's the family, Ryan?</i>

889
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:28,441
You nearly lost them,
didn't you?

890
01:07:28,508 --> 01:07:30,977
It's easy to get at them.

891
01:07:31,045 --> 01:07:34,380
You should look after
your family better, you know.

892
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,585
Are you there?

893
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:39,986
Yeah.

894
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:43,756
I understand your little girl's
feeling better, eh?

895
01:07:43,824 --> 01:07:45,074
Lost her spleen, though, yeah?

896
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:46,276
Pity that.

897
01:07:46,343 --> 01:07:48,778
Make it mighty tough on her

898
01:07:48,845 --> 01:07:50,280
to fight off infection,
eh, Jackie?

899
01:07:50,347 --> 01:07:52,748
You sick son of a bitch.

900
01:07:57,688 --> 01:07:59,955
It was him,
wasn't it?

901
01:08:02,192 --> 01:08:04,794
He's never going
to leave us alone.

902
01:08:08,181 --> 01:08:10,182
He'll never get that close
to us again, honey.

903
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:12,719
That's why he's making calls
in the middle of the night.

904
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:15,921
That's all he can do.

905
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:17,624
You get him, Jack.

906
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:20,627
I don't care what
you have to do.

907
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:22,194
Just get him.

01:08:51,308 --> 01:08:53,459
Can I buy you a drink?

915
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:56,829
No.

916
01:08:59,065 --> 01:09:01,334
Let me buy you one.

917
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:07,474
Barney, two whiskeys.

918
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:18,351
The IRA's not responsible
for all this.

919
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:19,853
I know that.

920
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,856
Are you waiting for me
to agree with you?

921
01:09:22,923 --> 01:09:24,457
I've been saying this
to the press

922
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:25,758
till I'm blue in the face.

923
01:09:25,826 --> 01:09:27,210
Well, that's the
point, isn't it?

924
01:09:27,277 --> 01:09:29,545
You claim responsibility
for one thing,

925
01:09:29,613 --> 01:09:31,648
deny it for another.

926
01:09:31,715 --> 01:09:34,083
Nobody believes you anymore.

927
01:09:34,151 --> 01:09:35,401
I want to know

928
01:09:35,468 --> 01:09:38,237
where Sean Miller
and Kevin O'Donnell are.

929
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:44,126
Let me try
and understand this.

930
01:09:44,194 --> 01:09:47,863
You want me to sell out
my fellow Irishmen to you?

931
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,365
Is that why
you came down here?

932
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:51,834
You don't understand me
at all.

933
01:09:51,902 --> 01:09:53,603
Oh, I think I do.

934
01:09:53,671 --> 01:09:56,655
Look, I don't give a damn
what they've done,

935
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:59,658
but the day that I
sell out my countrymen

936
01:09:59,727 --> 01:10:01,160
will be the day

937
01:10:01,228 --> 01:10:04,396
that I put a bullet
through my own head.

938
01:10:04,464 --> 01:10:07,600
That's it, then, huh?

939
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:08,618
That's it.

940
01:10:08,685 --> 01:10:10,119
You know, on second thought,

941
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:12,688
maybe I won't have
a drink with you.

942
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:14,189
Okay, then I'll go home.

943
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:15,691
Have a safe trip.

944
01:10:15,759 --> 01:10:17,426
I'll go home and call
the TV stations,

945
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:18,427
give them what they want--

946
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:19,946
let them take their cameras

947
01:10:20,013 --> 01:10:21,380
into my daughter's
hospital room.

948
01:10:21,448 --> 01:10:23,899
Put it on the evening news.

949
01:10:23,967 --> 01:10:25,368
I don't give a shit
whether you did it or not,

950
01:10:25,435 --> 01:10:27,370
and neither will anyone else,

951
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:30,373
but I will put
such a stranglehold

952
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,874
on your gun money,

953
01:10:31,941 --> 01:10:34,176
you'll be out in the
street throwing rocks.

954
01:10:34,244 --> 01:10:36,812
I will fucking destroy you.

955
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,799
I will make it
my mission in life.

956
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:46,255
Excuse me.

957
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:51,193
Well, lads, did you hear that?

958
01:11:06,944 --> 01:11:08,878
Stand sideways-- you're
less of a target.

959
01:11:14,968 --> 01:11:15,784
Yes!

960
01:11:17,955 --> 01:11:19,555
Satellite's coming!

961
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:22,825
Celts, let's go!

962
01:11:24,411 --> 01:11:25,411
Come on.

963
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,567
Get inside!

964
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:40,609
So...

965
01:11:41,578 --> 01:11:44,180
SO-13 traced
the weapons used

966
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:45,948
in the Lord Holmes incident

967
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:48,851
to an arms dealer
that supplies Kaddafi.

968
01:11:48,919 --> 01:11:50,686
Now, when
Sean Miller escaped,

969
01:11:50,754 --> 01:11:52,688
he was last seen in a zodiac

970
01:11:52,756 --> 01:11:54,690
heading out into the Channel
in a gale,

971
01:11:54,758 --> 01:11:56,859
which didn't make sense until
I checked on the freighters

972
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,162
that were out there that day.

973
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:00,179
Syrian registry.

974
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:01,714
Known to carry arms
from the Middle East

975
01:12:01,781 --> 01:12:03,366
to client states
in the Mediterranean

976
01:12:03,434 --> 01:12:04,967
including Kaddafi.

977
01:12:05,035 --> 01:12:08,204
So Miller takes a slow boat
to North Africa.

978
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:09,871
Exactly.

979
01:12:09,939 --> 01:12:12,374
Now, we send our birds
up over the desert,

980
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:13,875
photographing, what,
how many camps?

981
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:14,876
182.

982
01:12:14,944 --> 01:12:17,546
182 camps a day
in North Africa.

983
01:12:17,614 --> 01:12:20,215
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,

984
01:12:20,284 --> 01:12:24,052
Action-Directe,
West German Red Army Faction.

985
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,689
But on the day
that this particular ship

986
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:29,057
docked in Benghazi,
there's activity

987
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:31,727
in only nine camps
with people arriving.

988
01:12:31,795 --> 01:12:33,563
Now, this one
we know for sure is PLO.

989
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,230
This one's Shining Path.

990
01:12:35,298 --> 01:12:36,749
These seven we're not
so sure about.

991
01:12:36,816 --> 01:12:38,484
Why?

992
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:39,986
Well, we got satellites...

993
01:12:40,054 --> 01:12:41,988
Well, because the
people in those camps

994
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:44,857
know probably better than
we do exactly what time

995
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:47,393
the satellite's
going to pass overhead.

996
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:50,196
And, Marty...

997
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:53,482
unless you authorize us
to retask those satellites

998
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:57,169
so we can get a look before
they're overhead from the side,

999
01:12:57,237 --> 01:13:00,523
we are never going to know
which camp they're at.

1000
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:04,527
Jack, do you have
any idea how big a deal it is

1001
01:13:04,595 --> 01:13:07,196
to retask those satellites?

1002
01:13:07,264 --> 01:13:08,931
Yeah.

1003
01:13:21,778 --> 01:13:24,213
Bring up camp 18 again.

1004
01:13:30,453 --> 01:13:32,555
Tighten on the camp here.

1005
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:40,145
Let's look up in here...

1006
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:42,314
see what we can see.

1007
01:13:51,224 --> 01:13:54,343
Show me this grouping here.

1008
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:04,619
Hmm.

1009
01:14:07,424 --> 01:14:09,525
Hmm. No, that's nothing.

1010
01:14:09,593 --> 01:14:12,695
Go back to the, uh,
bigger picture.

1011
01:14:12,763 --> 01:14:14,864
Let me see down here.

1012
01:14:19,753 --> 01:14:21,353
What's that?

1013
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:24,106
Tighten up on that,
will you?

1014
01:14:32,365 --> 01:14:33,800
Hmm...

1015
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:37,569
Can you enhance that,
sharpen it up?

1016
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:52,518
Tits.

1017
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,854
I don't know.

1018
01:15:16,426 --> 01:15:19,595
SAS could take out
any one of these camps

1019
01:15:19,663 --> 01:15:21,063
in under two minutes,

1020
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:22,982
kill everybody there,

1021
01:15:23,049 --> 01:15:25,684
and be gone before
the echo fades.

1022
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:27,352
Are you sure

1023
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,870
this is the same woman?

1024
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:36,312
Keep at it, then.

1025
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,155
Son of a bitch.

1026
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:11,963
Hi.

1027
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:16,201
Read it again, Daddy.

1028
01:16:28,697 --> 01:16:30,465
"The sun did not shine.

1029
01:16:30,532 --> 01:16:32,968
"It was too wet to play,

1030
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:37,905
so we sat in the house
all that cold, cold, wet day."

1031
01:16:47,984 --> 01:16:49,750
"I sat there with Sally.

1032
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,087
"We sat there, we two,

1033
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,823
"and I said, how I wish
we had something to do.

1034
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:59,744
<i>"Too wet to go out,
too cold to play ball,</i>

1035
01:16:59,811 --> 01:17:02,247
<i>"so we sat in the house.</i>

1036
01:17:02,314 --> 01:17:04,014
<i>"We did nothing at all.</i>

1037
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:10,604
<i>"So all we could do
was just sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>

1038
01:17:10,673 --> 01:17:14,942
<i>And we did not like it,
not one little bit."</i>

1039
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:19,247
<i>"And then something went...</i>

1040
01:17:19,314 --> 01:17:20,448
<i>boom."</i>

1041
01:17:28,808 --> 01:17:30,925
<i>Dr. Hamani, please report</i>

1042
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:33,561
to the second floor
nurses' station. Dr. Hamani.

1043
01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:04,576
Paddy O'Neil
can sleep at night.

1044
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:06,578
In fact, he probably
enjoys the irony.

1045
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:09,647
She's not Irish. She's English.

1046
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,586
And this is the girl
you saw...

1047
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:17,939
in the blink of an eye

1048
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:20,574
in a jeep as it
passed you doing 40?

1049
01:18:20,642 --> 01:18:21,493
Yeah.

1050
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,928
What am I supposed
to do here?

1051
01:18:23,996 --> 01:18:26,764
Tell SO-13 you know who she is.
Tell them her name.

1052
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:27,999
Give them her picture.

1053
01:18:28,066 --> 01:18:28,967
Tell them that she poses
as a rare book dealer

1054
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:30,935
and ask them
to look for her.

1055
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:32,269
What do you mean
what do you do?

1056
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,772
What am I supposed
to do with you, Jack?

1057
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,109
You walk into a bar, half of
whose customers want you dead.

1058
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:40,111
You walk up to
the IRA's bagman,

1059
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:43,948
and in front of his guys,
you threaten him?

1060
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,967
You're not a field man,
Jack. You never were.

1061
01:18:47,035 --> 01:18:48,302
You are an analyst.

1062
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:49,303
Analyze that.

1063
01:18:49,371 --> 01:18:52,139
I am not after
your job, Marty.

1064
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:55,142
I'm after the man
who tried to kill my family.

1065
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:56,644
Then will you think?

1066
01:18:56,712 --> 01:19:00,147
You tell O'Neil that
you're looking for a girl.

1067
01:19:00,215 --> 01:19:02,483
He gives you the
pictures of a girl.

1068
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:03,818
He obliges you

1069
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:07,638
to get you off his back,
and you believe him?

1070
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:12,143
I didn't tell him
I was looking for a girl, Marty.

1071
01:19:37,769 --> 01:19:39,737
What's going on?

1072
01:19:42,608 --> 01:19:44,108
Sarge?
Hmm?

1073
01:19:44,175 --> 01:19:46,110
Come and look at this.

1074
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:01,592
Bit of a bookworm meself,

1075
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,295
not that you'd know it
to look at me.

1076
01:20:04,362 --> 01:20:07,799
What's your passion, then,
mysteries? Spy novels?

1077
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:09,801
Familiar with Ian Fleming,
are you?

1078
01:20:09,868 --> 01:20:11,569
This is a
rare book shop.

1079
01:20:11,637 --> 01:20:13,137
Rare books?

1080
01:20:13,205 --> 01:20:14,639
Yeah, so they are.

1081
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:15,974
Can you locate
the problem,

1082
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,809
or do I have to call
someone else?

1083
01:20:17,876 --> 01:20:18,810
Already have.

1084
01:20:18,877 --> 01:20:20,377
The wiring in
this whole place

1085
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:21,479
dates from
before the war.

1086
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:22,880
The first war.

1087
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:25,817
It's what we call in the
electrical business "rare."

1088
01:20:25,884 --> 01:20:27,318
Yes. Can you fix it?

1089
01:20:27,385 --> 01:20:28,820
Oh, sure. I can fix it.

1090
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:30,671
Can you afford it?
That's the question.

1091
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:32,006
Just fix it.

1092
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:41,633
Hello.

1093
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,617
He's seen it,
hasn't he?

1094
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:45,019
I don't know.

1095
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:50,108
He's got it. Look.

1096
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:53,278
Hey, what do you
make of this?

1097
01:20:53,345 --> 01:20:54,779
I, uh...

1098
01:20:57,983 --> 01:20:59,633
I... I have no idea.

1099
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:01,969
Damn!

1100
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:04,221
Um...

1101
01:21:04,289 --> 01:21:07,808
I have to go out now
for a few minutes...

1102
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:09,477
to deliver some books.

1103
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:12,630
Please keep about
your repairs.

1104
01:21:12,698 --> 01:21:15,633
I'll be here all week, guv.
Don't worry.

1105
01:21:56,858 --> 01:21:58,459
He's mine!

1106
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:33,995
Damn!

1107
01:22:49,744 --> 01:22:52,096
Dinner at the White
House is no problem.

1108
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:53,531
What is the problem?

1109
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:57,035
No problem, we're just
running out of dates.

1110
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:58,870
Yes. We could do that.

1111
01:22:58,938 --> 01:23:00,371
Move that to there,

1112
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:02,707
which would leave us...

1113
01:23:02,775 --> 01:23:04,576
the 14th?

1114
01:23:04,643 --> 01:23:05,944
The 14th.

1115
01:23:06,011 --> 01:23:06,945
Geoffrey

1116
01:23:07,012 --> 01:23:08,546
let's check
with John Ryan

1117
01:23:08,614 --> 01:23:11,282
about scheduling
a presentation dinner

1118
01:23:11,349 --> 01:23:14,518
at our embassy
in Washington on the, uh...

1119
01:23:14,586 --> 01:23:16,554
14th.

1120
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:18,522
The 14th.

1121
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:21,725
So let's go over this again
so I can get it clear.

1122
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:31,251
Geoffrey Watkins.

1123
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:34,922
Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm
trying to reach Mr. Titus.

1124
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:37,191
Is that extension 2691?

1125
01:23:37,259 --> 01:23:39,026
No, this is 2619.

1126
01:23:39,094 --> 01:23:40,527
I'm terribly sorry.

1127
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:52,707
What are you doing up?
Go back to bed.

1128
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:55,543
I wanted to be there
when she wakes up.

1129
01:23:57,011 --> 01:23:58,462
I'll go with you,
and then I'll take a cab back.

1130
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,664
Okay.

1131
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:03,384
Hello.

1132
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:05,386
Yes. Just a minute.

1133
01:24:05,454 --> 01:24:07,555
It's for you...

1134
01:24:07,623 --> 01:24:08,723
Sir John.

1135
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,392
Hello.

1136
01:24:13,945 --> 01:24:15,313
Excuse me, sir.

1137
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:17,781
Mr. Ryan has a special
celebration that evening

1138
01:24:17,849 --> 01:24:18,849
that he can't change.

1139
01:24:18,917 --> 01:24:20,651
He wondered if you
might care to join them.

1140
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,887
Where, at his house?

1141
01:24:22,955 --> 01:24:24,021
Yes, sir.

1142
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:29,127
Why not?

1143
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:42,523
We shot this eight
days ago in Berlin.

1144
01:24:42,591 --> 01:24:44,191
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:45,692
One...

1146
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,361
two...

1147
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:50,864
three, four Brits
traveling with him.

1148
01:24:50,932 --> 01:24:52,699
Light arms.

1149
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:56,036
The heavy stuff's
in the cars.

1150
01:24:56,104 --> 01:24:58,872
He's German...
he's German.

1151
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:00,707
This boring you, Sean?

1152
01:25:00,775 --> 01:25:03,377
Four, six altogether.

1153
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:07,214
Should be the same security
when Holmes flies to Washington.

1154
01:25:07,282 --> 01:25:10,384
We've got to find the moment
when he's unprotected.

1155
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:15,122
Four days in Washington,
one day in New York.

1156
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,174
Shopping.

1157
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:34,658
Yeah. Two Caucasians.

1158
01:25:34,726 --> 01:25:37,995
Take a look at
the one with the hat.

1159
01:25:39,731 --> 01:25:42,166
His arms look a little pink.

1160
01:25:42,234 --> 01:25:44,902
Sunburn. New arrival.

1161
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:02,854
What do you think,
same guy?

1162
01:26:06,024 --> 01:26:08,876
That rare book dealer,
Dennis Cooley...

1163
01:26:08,943 --> 01:26:10,711
he's bald.

1164
01:26:13,098 --> 01:26:14,999
Now, it's possible

1165
01:26:15,067 --> 01:26:18,218
there could be a woman
in some of these camps,

1166
01:26:18,286 --> 01:26:21,589
but with her and Cooley
in the same place--

1167
01:26:23,508 --> 01:26:25,209
<i>if that is Cooley--</i>

1168
01:26:25,276 --> 01:26:29,213
the odds of coincidence
are dropping fast.

1169
01:26:30,632 --> 01:26:34,435
Still, I... I don't know.
There's no way I can be...

1170
01:26:36,337 --> 01:26:38,205
absolutely certain.

1171
01:26:38,273 --> 01:26:40,107
Excuse me, Jack.

1172
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:42,209
Tell me one thing in life

1173
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:43,978
that is absolutely
for certain.

1174
01:26:46,597 --> 01:26:48,899
My daughter's love.

1175
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:53,721
What I need to hear from
you is your best guess,

1176
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:56,457
and I think I've heard it.

1177
01:27:00,278 --> 01:27:02,212
Haven't I?

1178
01:27:12,624 --> 01:27:15,560
The bastards took away
my book shop.

1179
01:27:15,627 --> 01:27:17,061
They took away my books!

1180
01:27:17,128 --> 01:27:19,564
I'm sorry, Dennis.
You can't come.

1181
01:27:19,631 --> 01:27:21,566
You haven't got the training,

1182
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:23,901
and this mission's
going to be very messy.

1183
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:25,403
I can fire a gun.

1184
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:51,028
Sorry, Dennis.

1185
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:24,745
Where are you
taking me, Marty?

1186
01:28:24,813 --> 01:28:27,915
It's you who've
taken us, Jack.

1187
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:30,083
Satellite now
entering target area.

1188
01:28:30,151 --> 01:28:32,252
Into battle.

1189
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:33,721
Sir.

1190
01:28:33,789 --> 01:28:35,790
Enlargement sector four.

1191
01:28:43,665 --> 01:28:45,232
Airborne support

1192
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:49,937
approaching target area--
ETA, 35 seconds.

1193
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:25,806
SAS team on ground.

1194
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:42,456
Enlarge camp 18.
Enlarging.

1195
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:47,228
Enlarge primary target.
Enlarging.

1196
01:29:55,169 --> 01:29:57,254
That is a kill.

1197
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:04,094
<i>Roger, roger.
It's go, go, go.</i>

1198
01:30:10,268 --> 01:30:12,235
Targets have
been neutralized.

1199
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:26,550
Airborne support approaching.

1200
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,420
Enlarge sector five.

1201
01:30:33,591 --> 01:30:35,192
Angle on sector nine.

1202
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,826
Sector nine.

1203
01:30:47,438 --> 01:30:49,690
Angle sector two.

1204
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:51,208
Sector two.

1205
01:30:56,681 --> 01:30:58,698
SAS team withdrawing.

1206
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:10,243
Keyhole is passing
out of visual.

1207
01:31:23,992 --> 01:31:25,159
It's over.

1208
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:58,391
Come on, honey.

1209
01:31:58,459 --> 01:31:59,560
Jump.

1210
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:07,901
See?

1211
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,914
Appreciate it. Thanks.

1212
01:32:27,822 --> 01:32:31,157
Surveillance team one,
all clear.

1213
01:32:32,227 --> 01:32:33,660
Roger that.

1214
01:32:33,728 --> 01:32:36,062
You sure your men outside
wouldn't like some coffee?

1215
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:38,052
No, thank you, Mrs. Ryan.
They'll be just fine.

1216
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:38,557
Okay.

1217
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,999
And I'd to thank
you, Miss Ryan,

1218
01:32:40,067 --> 01:32:41,835
for allowing us to impose
upon your homecoming.

1219
01:32:41,902 --> 01:32:43,169
You're wel...

1220
01:32:43,238 --> 01:32:44,671
You're a beautiful
and gracious young lady,

1221
01:32:44,739 --> 01:32:46,340
You're wel...

1222
01:32:46,407 --> 01:32:48,709
and it's my distinct pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

1223
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:49,776
You're welcome.

1224
01:32:51,112 --> 01:32:53,330
I thought I might make
the presentation

1225
01:32:53,398 --> 01:32:55,032
after dinner if you agree.

1226
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,367
Oh, sure.

1227
01:32:56,434 --> 01:32:58,768
Would you like to see it now?

1228
01:32:58,836 --> 01:33:00,104
Uh, Geoffrey...

1229
01:33:05,643 --> 01:33:07,044
Oh, my. That's very nice.

1230
01:33:07,112 --> 01:33:10,664
Didn't I already give
you one of those?

1231
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:15,636
Help yourselves.

1232
01:33:24,295 --> 01:33:26,397
Is that your second piece
of cake, my little sweetie?

1233
01:33:26,464 --> 01:33:29,966
Where's the bathroom, Jack?

1234
01:33:30,034 --> 01:33:32,403
Um, second door on the left.
Thank you.

1235
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,837
More coffee, anyone?

1236
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:35,339
I'd love some.

1237
01:33:36,408 --> 01:33:37,941
Uh, excuse me.

1238
01:33:38,009 --> 01:33:40,426
<i>Here it comes.</i>

1239
01:33:41,363 --> 01:33:42,363
Bathroom?

1240
01:33:44,265 --> 01:33:45,366
Someone in there.

1241
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:48,202
No, that's not it.
That's... the basement.

1242
01:33:56,594 --> 01:33:57,527
Hello.

1243
01:33:57,595 --> 01:33:58,528
Jack? Marty.

1244
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:00,563
Hey, Marty. What's going on?

1245
01:34:00,631 --> 01:34:02,198
I'm sorry to interrupt
your party,

1246
01:34:02,266 --> 01:34:04,301
but I thought
you'd like to know right away.

1247
01:34:04,368 --> 01:34:07,654
SAS just made positive ID
on Dennis Cooley.

1248
01:34:07,722 --> 01:34:08,989
What about the others?

1249
01:34:09,056 --> 01:34:11,291
Well, it was pretty messy
as it turns out.

1250
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:14,677
It's going to take 48 hours
to verify the dental records,

1251
01:34:14,745 --> 01:34:17,798
but they're keeping right on it.

1252
01:34:17,865 --> 01:34:19,349
Oh, great.

1253
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:20,934
What?

1254
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:22,903
The storm just knocked out
the power here to the house.

1255
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:24,571
I got to light some candles.

1256
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,573
I'll light one for you, too.

1257
01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:28,075
Okay, Marty. Thanks.

1258
01:34:31,446 --> 01:34:33,714
What, forget to pay
your bill, Cath?

1259
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:35,716
Oh, Robert... very funny.

1260
01:34:35,783 --> 01:34:37,217
Everyone all right?

1261
01:34:37,284 --> 01:34:38,702
We're fine, Jack.

1262
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:41,721
This doesn't happen
very often.

1263
01:34:41,789 --> 01:34:44,708
Only when we have
royalty over for dinner.

1264
01:34:47,178 --> 01:34:48,462
I knew you'd understand.

1265
01:34:51,299 --> 01:34:53,067
Something wrong?

1266
01:34:53,134 --> 01:34:55,069
Come with me, will you?

1267
01:34:57,905 --> 01:34:59,272
If the storm had
knocked out the lights,

1268
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:00,723
they'd be out in
the boathouse, too.

1269
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:01,724
So?

1270
01:35:01,792 --> 01:35:03,159
Power comes in
from the street,

1271
01:35:03,227 --> 01:35:05,228
and then branches off to here.

1272
01:35:06,965 --> 01:35:08,398
Jesus.

1273
01:35:10,735 --> 01:35:13,904
This is Ryan. Any DSS agent?

1274
01:35:13,972 --> 01:35:16,523
Any DSS agent, this is Ryan.

1275
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:18,592
Maryland troopers? Anyone?

1276
01:35:20,195 --> 01:35:22,245
Is anyone reading me?

1277
01:35:22,313 --> 01:35:24,347
Anybody?

1278
01:35:24,415 --> 01:35:27,768
Can I come back down
when the lights are on?

1279
01:35:27,836 --> 01:35:29,770
No, sweetie.
You got to get some sleep.

1280
01:35:29,838 --> 01:35:31,538
It's very late.

1281
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:33,290
Goddamn.

1282
01:35:37,712 --> 01:35:39,146
Don't tell me.

1283
01:35:39,214 --> 01:35:40,747
Quite a storm.

1284
01:35:46,004 --> 01:35:47,437
Take your hands off me.

1285
01:35:47,505 --> 01:35:49,139
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

1286
01:35:49,207 --> 01:35:50,207
Jack!

1287
01:35:54,545 --> 01:35:55,545
Gun.

1288
01:35:57,181 --> 01:35:58,281
Jack.

1289
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,362
Uh-uh. Stay right there.

1290
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:13,296
Shit.

1291
01:36:14,282 --> 01:36:15,983
Rob, over here.

1292
01:36:22,089 --> 01:36:24,657
What's the plan?
How many are coming?

1293
01:36:24,725 --> 01:36:26,026
Where's Sean Miller?

1294
01:36:26,093 --> 01:36:28,044
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1295
01:36:28,046 --> 01:36:29,712
Give me the gun.

1296
01:36:33,885 --> 01:36:35,619
Five, six...

1297
01:36:35,687 --> 01:36:37,454
I don't know. Maybe more.

1298
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,857
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.

1299
01:36:46,748 --> 01:36:48,882
Take this. Get down
in the basement quick.

1300
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:50,116
Where's Cathy and Sally?

1301
01:36:50,185 --> 01:36:51,951
They're upstairs.
She's putting Sally to bed.

1302
01:36:52,019 --> 01:36:53,420
Go.
What's wrong?

1303
01:37:21,382 --> 01:37:24,718
Come on, Ryan. Show yourself.

1304
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,141
Annette, upstairs.

1305
01:37:31,209 --> 01:37:32,175
Right.

1306
01:37:48,509 --> 01:37:50,660
Come on, sweetie, come on.

1307
01:37:51,963 --> 01:37:53,396
What's wrong, Mommy?

1308
01:37:53,464 --> 01:37:54,831
Shh, Shh.

1309
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:57,601
Now, you've got to help me.
Climb up on the stool.

1310
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:59,385
There's a shotgun there.

1311
01:38:12,866 --> 01:38:16,586
Oh, God, Jack,
what did you do with the shells?

1312
01:38:20,575 --> 01:38:22,008
<i>Go. Go, go, go, go.</i>

1313
01:39:11,459 --> 01:39:12,425
Get down.
Mommy!

1314
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,927
Go on.

1315
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:35,915
Get back.

1316
01:39:48,262 --> 01:39:50,080
You all right?

1317
01:39:50,148 --> 01:39:51,064
Where's Sally?

1318
01:39:51,132 --> 01:39:52,199
Daddy...
Sally?

1319
01:39:52,266 --> 01:39:54,234
It's okay, honey.

1320
01:39:56,937 --> 01:39:58,672
Come on, come on.

1321
01:40:20,478 --> 01:40:23,413
Honey, you just got
to be real quiet.

1322
01:40:23,481 --> 01:40:24,681
Real quiet.

1323
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:44,200
Gotcha.

1324
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:13,646
Christ.

1325
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,651
Hold on.

1326
01:41:22,323 --> 01:41:23,640
Come on, come on.

1327
01:41:41,843 --> 01:41:44,594
What are you talking about?
Who is off the air?

1328
01:41:44,661 --> 01:41:46,662
DSS, state troopers, everyone.

1329
01:41:46,731 --> 01:41:48,164
The security company rep...

1330
01:41:48,232 --> 01:41:51,935
Get me Hostage Rescue
at Quantico now.

1331
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:59,025
Robby! Open up.

1332
01:41:59,092 --> 01:42:00,860
Robby, it's us.

1333
01:42:00,928 --> 01:42:01,928
Jack?

1334
01:42:04,165 --> 01:42:05,265
They're outside.

1335
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,767
Sean, cool it.
It's the royal we want.

1336
01:42:07,835 --> 01:42:10,287
We can't ransom a dead body.

1337
01:42:11,172 --> 01:42:13,757
They're all over
the place, man.

1338
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:15,625
Stay close to me.

1339
01:42:17,661 --> 01:42:20,113
How were you going
to get away, huh?

1340
01:42:20,181 --> 01:42:22,615
Want to go
for the other knee?

1341
01:42:23,684 --> 01:42:24,617
Come on.

1342
01:42:24,685 --> 01:42:27,287
Boats. Bottom of the cliff.

1343
01:42:27,354 --> 01:42:28,922
There are ropes.

1344
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,224
Kevin!

1345
01:43:41,078 --> 01:43:42,495
You killed him!

1346
01:44:36,299 --> 01:44:37,917
No, Sean, no!

1347
01:44:37,985 --> 01:44:39,985
We need Holmes alive!

1348
01:44:40,053 --> 01:44:41,371
We're past that!

1349
01:44:41,438 --> 01:44:42,872
Alive!

1350
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,934
Come on!

1351
01:45:15,622 --> 01:45:17,173
Any contact?

1352
01:45:19,076 --> 01:45:20,493
Still off the air.

1353
01:45:41,248 --> 01:45:42,765
There he is!

1354
01:45:52,709 --> 01:45:54,911
Stay down there.

1355
01:46:20,754 --> 01:46:23,088
Come on, you bastards.

1356
01:46:28,212 --> 01:46:30,029
Come on! Come on!

1357
01:46:31,532 --> 01:46:32,765
He's alone!

1358
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:36,019
He's leading us away
from the royal!

1359
01:46:36,021 --> 01:46:36,952
Turn around, Sean.

1360
01:46:37,021 --> 01:46:38,104
No.

1361
01:46:38,106 --> 01:46:39,639
Turn it round, Sean!

1362
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:40,623
-Turn it round, Sean!
-No!

1363
01:46:40,691 --> 01:46:41,607
Sean!

1364
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,044
Turn it round!
Turn it round!

1365
01:46:45,112 --> 01:46:48,047
Forget about Ryan!

1366
01:46:48,115 --> 01:46:50,583
Don't blow
the mission now, boy!

1367
01:46:50,585 --> 01:46:52,335
That's not my mission!

1368
01:46:58,391 --> 01:47:01,094
You crazy bastard!

1369
01:47:46,356 --> 01:47:47,456
Damn!

1370
01:51:19,136 --> 01:51:20,586
Had enough to eat, honey,

1371
01:51:20,654 --> 01:51:23,089
or do you want something else?
Want some toast or...?

1372
01:51:23,157 --> 01:51:24,390
Pancakes.

1373
01:51:24,457 --> 01:51:26,025
There's no time
for pancakes, honey.

1374
01:51:26,093 --> 01:51:27,293
Do you want toast
or toast?

1375
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:28,695
<i>Toast.</i>

1376
01:51:28,762 --> 01:51:30,863
Is somebody going to get that?
I'm getting it.

1377
01:51:30,931 --> 01:51:32,665
Sally?

1378
01:51:32,733 --> 01:51:34,366
Hello. It is.

1379
01:51:34,434 --> 01:51:36,102
Yeah, hold
on a second.

1380
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:39,371
Where's your backpack?
It's Dr. Zaillian.

1381
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:40,873
The amnio.
Yeah.

1382
01:51:40,941 --> 01:51:42,909
Hello.

1383
01:51:42,976 --> 01:51:45,161
Is it going to be okay?

1384
01:51:45,228 --> 01:51:47,163
It's going to be fine, honey.

1385
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:49,432
We're just waiting to find out.

1386
01:51:52,569 --> 01:51:53,669
Great.

1387
01:51:53,736 --> 01:51:55,304
What do you want
on your toast, honey?

1388
01:51:55,372 --> 01:51:56,956
Strawberry?

1389
01:51:57,024 --> 01:51:57,940
Strawberry.

1390
01:51:58,008 --> 01:52:00,343
Hold on a second.

1391
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:02,128
Do you want to know
what it is?

1392
01:52:02,196 --> 01:52:03,629
Did he tell you?

1393
01:52:03,697 --> 01:52:05,131
He's asking. I'm asking you.

1394
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,566
I don't know.
Do you want to know?

1395
01:52:07,634 --> 01:52:09,385
I don't know. Do you?

1396
01:52:09,452 --> 01:52:12,722
Well, I thought I wanted to
know, but now I'm not so sure.

1397
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,223
Hold on a second.
We're discussing it.

1398
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:15,725
Me, neither.

1399
01:52:15,793 --> 01:52:17,660
I mean, I do and I don't.

1400
01:52:17,728 --> 01:52:19,512
Um...

1401
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:21,630
He's waiting.

1402
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:28,203
Okay.

1403
01:52:28,271 --> 01:52:30,055
Tell us.

1404
01:52:31,258 --> 01:52:33,426
Okay, tell us.

1405
01:52:37,731 --> 01:52:39,264
Thank you.
