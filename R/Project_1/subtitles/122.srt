1
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,377
He is coming.

2
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:43,754
Cover your butt.

3
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,089
Cover the what?

4
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,262
Vitruvius.

5
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:52,805
Lord Business.

6
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:55,099
You've hidden the Kragle well, old man.

7
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:57,268
Robots, destroy him!

8
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:59,228
Yes, Lord Business.

9
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,480
Your robots are no match
for a MasterBuilder.

10
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,024
For I see everything!

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,985
Unh! My eyes! Ow!

12
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,655
The Kragle. The most powerful super weapon...

13
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:11,490
...is mine.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,451
Oh, the Kragle!

15
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:19,832
Now my evil power will be unlimited!
Can you feel me?

16
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:20,916
I can feel you.

17
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,127
Whoo! Nothing's gonna stop me now.

18
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:24,897
Wait. There was a prophecy.

19
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,672
Oh, now there's a prophecy.

20
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,382
About the Piece of Resistance.

21
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:31,552
Oh, yes! The supposed
missing Piece of Resistance...

22
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:34,138
...that can somehow magically
disarm the Kragle.

23
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:35,973
Give me a break!

24
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:40,352
One day, a talented less or fellow

25
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:42,855
A Special One with face of yellow

26
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:45,733
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

27
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:48,611
From its hiding refuge underground

28
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:50,863
And with a noble army at the helm

29
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:55,117
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm

30
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,661
And be the greatest
Most interesting

31
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:00,831
Most important person of all times

32
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,833
All of this is true

33
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,668
Because it rhymes

34
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,670
Oh, wow.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,715
That was a great, inspiring legend...

36
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,050
...that you made up.

37
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,387
A "Special One"?

38
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:19,308
What a bunch of hippie-dippie baloney.

39
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,329
Good morning, apartment!

40
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,373
Good morning, doorway!
Good morning, wall.

41
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:44,333
Good morning, ceiling.
Good morning, floor!

42
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,584
Ready to start the day!

43
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:48,629
Ah, here it is!

44
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,919
"Instructions to fit in...

45
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,290
...have everybody like you...

46
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:52,633
...and always be happy!

47
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:54,051
Step one:

48
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,260
Breathe."

49
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:00,349
Okay, got that one down.

50
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,310
"Step two: Greet the day,
smile and say..."

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,562
Good morning, city!

52
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:07,893
- Good morning, city!
- Good morning, city!

53
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,947
- Good morning, city!
- Top of the morning to you there, city!

54
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:13,874
- Good morning, city! How you doing?
- Good morning, city!

55
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:16,490
"Step three: Exercise."

56
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,409
Jumping jacks. Hit them!

57
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,743
One!

58
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:21,620
Two!

59
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:22,871
Three!

60
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:24,373
I am so pumped up!

61
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,041
"Step four: Shower."

62
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:30,671
And always be sure to keep
the soap out of your...! Aah!

63
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,464
Shave your face.

64
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:33,757
Brush your teeth.

65
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,884
Comb your hair. Hmm.

66
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,053
"Wear clothes."

67
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,389
Oop! I almost forgot that one!

68
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,182
No. No. Uh-uh. No.

69
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,642
Not that. Wrong.

70
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,269
And that's it. Check.

71
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,604
Step nine: Eat a complete breakfast...

72
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:51,066
...with all the special people in your life.

73
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,403
Hey, Plantie, what do you
wanna do this morning?

74
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,572
Watch TV? Me too!

75
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,490
Hi, I'm President Business...

76
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,826
president of the Ootan Corporation
and the world.

77
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:04,076
Let's take extra care to follow the instructions,
or you'll be put to sleep.

78
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,457
And don't forget Taco Tuesday's
coming next week!

79
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:10,461
That's the day every rule-following citizen
gets a free taco and my love!

80
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:11,462
Have a great day, everybody!

81
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:13,714
You have a great day too,
President Business.

82
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:16,091
Man, he's such a cool guy.
I always wanna hear more of what...

83
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,718
Wait, did he say "put to sleep"?

84
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,728
Tonight on Where Are My Pants?

85
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,599
Honey, where are my pants?

86
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,605
What was I just thinking? I don't care.

87
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:32,107
"Step 11: Greet your neighbors."

88
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:33,484
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, pal.

89
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,194
Whoa! Hey, Surfer Dave.

90
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:36,320
Hey, brah.

91
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,213
- Oh, good morning, Sherrie.

92
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:39,531

00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,330
- Jeff.

96
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,500
Step 12: Obey all traffic signs and regulations.

97
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,294
Step 13: Enjoy popular music.

98
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:53,584
Top of the charts again...

99
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:56,395
- ...it's "Everything Is Awesome."
- Oh, my gosh, I love this song!

100
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,842
Everything is awesome

101
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,552
Everything is cool

102
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:02,304
When you're part of a team

103
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,140
Everything is awesome

104
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,809
When we're living our

105
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:07,643
Dream

106
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,394
Always use a turn signal.

107
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,688
Park between the lines. Yes!

108
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,300
Drop off dry-cleaning before noon.

109
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,358
Read the headlines.

110
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,526
Don't forget to smile.

111
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:17,296
Always root for the local sports team.

112
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:18,862
Go, Sports Team!

113
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,193
Always return a compliment.

114
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:21,949
- Hey, you look nice.
- So do you!

115
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,700
Drink overpriced coffee.

116
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,911
Here you go. That's $37.

117
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,579
Awesome!

118
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,665
Everything is awesome

119
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:33,001
Did you see
Where Are My Pants? last night?

120
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:35,087
"Honey, where's my pants?"

121
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,381
Classic episode.

122
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:39,675
Everything is awesome

123
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,178
Instructions coming in from Central.

124
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:46,223
Okay, it says here to take
everything weird and blow it up.

125
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,228
All right, Cylinderheads...

126
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,146
...let's make it look
like it does in the instructions!

127
00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:54,206
Hey, buddy!

128
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,607
I need a 1-by-2 key hole.

129
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:56,775
No problem, Michael.

130
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:58,465
We need a 2-by-2 macaroni.

131
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,445
2-by-2 macaroni flying in. Here's one.

132
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:03,699
Guys, got a 1-by-1
with an indented stud on one side.

133
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:06,743
- Cheese slopes. Come on, everybody.
- Roger that, Roger.

134
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:08,034
Look alive, coming at you.

135
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,204
Can I get a couple LURPs over here?

136
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,540
- Thanks, Gail.
- Guys, watch me drill this down.

137
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,251
Everything is awesome

138
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,838
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

139
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,674
Everything is awesome

140
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,175
When we're living our dream

141
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,106
Have you heard the news?
Everyone's talkin'

142
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,220
Life is good
Because everything's awesome

143
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,057
Man, I feel so good right now!
I could sing this song for hours!

144
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,854
Everything is awesome

145
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,440
When we're living our dream

146
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,692
When you're part of a team!

147
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:41,862
Yeah!

148
00:06:42,112 --> 00:06:44,823
I'm going to the sports bar
after work tonight.

149
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:48,452
Who wants to eat some delicious
chicken wings and get crazy?

150
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,142
Chicken wings? I love chicken wings!

151
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,264
Hey, who wants to share a croissant
with this guy?

152
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,557
Croissants? I love croissants.

153
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:55,417
Oh, yeah! I sure do love giant sausages.

154
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,627
Giant sausages? No way!

155
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:58,420
You know what I love to do?

156
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,689
Is share a meal
with the special people in my life.

157
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:01,965
Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you?

158
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,426
Ah! No, wait, guys!

159
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,929
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there.

160
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,513
Oh. Where did it go?

161
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,682
Oh, there you are.

162
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:16,021
I think I heard a whoosh.

163
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:25,238
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this...

164
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:26,823
...but, uh, I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

165
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,910
Yeah, the rules specifically state...

166
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,829
...work site closes at 6,
it's a hard-hat area only.

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,916
That's not official safety orange.

168
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:40,045
"If you see anything weird,
report it immediately."

169
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,214
Well, I guess I'm gonna...

170
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,760
...have to report youuu...

171
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,388
...uuu...

172
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,432
...uuu...

173
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:54,685
...uuu...

174
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,269
...uuu...

175
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,646
...uuu...

176
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:58,981
...uuu...

177
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,524
...uuu...

178
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:02,275
...uuu...

179
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:07,406
Where are you going? Miss!
I didn't mean to scare you! I'm sor...

180
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,920
Ow. Ow!

181
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,964
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad.

182
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,425
Yeow! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Ooh!

183
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,805
Ow.

184
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,640
Ow.

185
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,600
Hey.

186
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,650
What is that?

187
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,863
Come here.

188
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:52,409
What do I do?
I don't have my instructions.

189
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,245
Touch the Piece.

190
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:58,957
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece.

191
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,503
I feel like maybe I should touch that.

192
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,547
It's so...

193
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:06,965
...interesting.

194
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:08,467
Touch the Piece.

195
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,388
It's so interesting.

196
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,766
Touch the Piece.

197
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:17,559
Touch the Piece.

198
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,020
- Touch the Piece.
- Uh...

199
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,064
Touch the...

200
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,110
A Special One with face of yellow

201
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,613
Will make the Piece of Resistance found

202
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:32,449
From its hiding refuge underground

203
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:33,992
What's going on down here?

204
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:37,412
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm

205
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:38,702
Come on, Emmet!

206
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,151
The Special has arisen.

207
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,917
It's your turn to be the hero.

208
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:44,753
- Wake up.
- Ugh.

209
00:09:45,003 --> 00:09:46,129
Come on, wake up!

210
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,539
Where are the MasterBuilders?

211
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,549
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance? Eh?

212
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,041
- Where are the others hiding?
- Good morning, apartment?

213
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,261
- Aah!

214
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,113
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance?

215
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:56,181
The piece of what?

216
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,266
The Piece of Resistance.

217
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,820
I... I don't... Where am I? What's happening?

218
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:03,897
"What's happening?"

219
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:05,941
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.

220
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,567
No. I... "MasterBuilder"?

221
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:10,403
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?
- No.

222
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:11,254
Or The Special?

223
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:12,155
No, no!

224
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,990
You're a liar! We'll kill you!

225
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:19,746
Look, um,
I watch a lot of cop shows on TV.

226
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:22,374
Isn't there supposed to also be...?

227
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,627
Isn't there supposed to be a good cop?

228
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,631
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.

229
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:32,968
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly
neighborhood police officer!

230
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,529
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually.

231
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:36,304
Too bad.

232
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,056
Security cameras picked up this.

233
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:42,060
Unh! You were found at the construction site
convulsing with a strange piece.

234
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,228
That's disgusting!

235
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,814
Then why is it permanently stuck
to your back?

236
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,985
Get it off me! Get it off me! Aah!

237
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,635
It won't come off! It's chasing me!

238
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,029
Look, it's not my fault!

239
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,040
I have no idea how this thing
got on my back!

240
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,950
Of course, buddy. I believe you.

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,868
Great. Aah!

242
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,578
I "believe" you too.

243
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:02,247
You see the quotations
I'm making with my claw hands?

244
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,708
It means I don't believe you!

245
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,626
Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back...

246
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,770
...just three days before
President Business...

247
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:11,006
...is going to use the Kragle
to end the world?

248
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,300
President Business is gonna end the world?

249
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,843
But he's such a good guy.

250
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:17,262
And Octan, they make good stuff.

251
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:19,890
Music, dairy products, coffee, TV shows...

252
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,351
...surveillance systems,
all history books, voting machines.

253
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:24,269
Wait a minute.

254
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:26,980
Come on, you can't be this stupid.

255
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,607
This is a misunderstanding.

256
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,650
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy.

257
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:32,986
I'm late to meet my best friends
in the whole world.

258
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,029
They're probably missing me right now.

259
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,739
They're probably out looking around.

260
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,190
"Hey, where's Emmet?
Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"

261
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,619
Hey, you know what?
Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.

262
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,538
Oh, we asked them, all right.

263
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:44,623
Boom!

264
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:46,958
That guy's not a criminal mastermind.

265
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,001
See?

266
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:51,671
Yeah. You know, he's kind of
an average, normal kind of guy.

267
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:52,839
Thank you.

268
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:53,798
But, you know, he's not, like...

269
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,218
...normal like us. No.

270
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,179
He's not that special.

271
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,182
Wait, I'm so confused.
Who are we talking about?

272
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,393
Wait, does he work with us?

273
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:06,978
Gail doesn't remember me?

274
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,104
Look at Randy here.

275
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:10,857
He likes sausage. That's something.

276
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,652
Gail is perky. That's something.

277
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:14,444
And Harry...

278
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,863
- ...well...
- When you say Harry, I go:

279
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:21,493
When you say the other guy, I go:

280
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:23,662
Harry's the best!

281
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,039
- Harry's got personality.
- He's weird! He's weird!

282
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,459
I know that guy but I know, like,
zippy-zap about him.

283
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,169
We just talked earlier.

284
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,213
I mean, all he does is say yes...

285
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,507
...to everything everybody else is doing.

286
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,884
You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!"

287
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:40,845
Little bit of a blank slate, I guess.

288
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:43,890
That'll be $42, please.

289
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,103
We all have something that makes us
something and Emmet is...

290
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:51,731
...nothing.

291
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:54,859
There you go.

292
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:58,113
- I told you I was a nobody.
- Oh.

293
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,906
It's the perfect cover.

294
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,825
Cover? Cover for what?

295
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:04,661
I can't break him.
Take him to the melting chamber.

296
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:06,746
What? Aah!

297
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,127
You're gonna melt me? Am I gonna die?

298
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:13,712
You'll live. You'll be fine.

299
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,424
President Business.
I have him right here, sir.

300
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:21,636
Yes, we've told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape, but, um...

301
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,138
...we're lying to him.

302
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,889
Wait, what did he just say?

303
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,057
Hold still.

304
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:29,227
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here.
You've got the wrong...

305
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,271
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

306
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,107
That is gonna start hurting...

307
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,400
...pretty soon.

308
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,342
Ow, ow, ow!

309
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:04,512
No, no, no!

310
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:08,850
Whoa. Who are you?

311
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,606
It's you?

312
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,608
Come with me if you wanna not die.

313
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,238
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi...?

314
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:23,156
Hey, hey, hey!

315
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,241
Red alert, red alert.

316
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:28,953
I need everyone, repeat: everyone, to go after The Special.

317
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,332
The tunnel's that way.

318
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,418
Oh, boy!

319
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:37,253
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.

320
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:41,257
- We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.
- Ow. Oh.

321
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,436
So, uh, didn't catch your name...

322
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:57,023
...or anything about what you're, uh, up to.

323
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,691
Or what we're doing here.

324
00:14:58,942 --> 00:15:01,502
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended
to be a useless nobody...

325
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:04,072
...but you can drop the act with me.
It's cool.

326
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,782
Oh, the act.

327
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,409
Whoa.

328
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,495
Whoa!

329
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,455
Jump on. Let's go!

330
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,379
- Hey, uh, I...
- Hang on, sir.

331
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:20,469
All units...

332
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:22,424
...cut him off on Elm, now!

333
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:23,800
Or whenever you can.

334
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,385
10-4, Bad Cop.

335
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:26,928
- Watch out!
- Hold on.

336
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:31,391
We need to meet up with Vitruvius...

337
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,309
...and tell him the Piece has been found.
Uh-huh.

338
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,960
They're up on the monorail.

339
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:36,438
Release the copper choppers.

340
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:46,448
Oh, no!

341
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,410
Will you please tell me what is happening?

342
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:53,121
I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.

343
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,205
You're The Special.

344
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:55,373
Me?

345
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,502
You found the Piece of Resistance.

346
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,045
And the prophecy states...

347
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:03,465
...that you are the most important,
most talented...

348
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:04,841
...most interesting...

349
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:09,095
...and most extraordinary person
in the universe.

350
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,139
That's you. Right?

351
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,518
Uh, yes. That's me.

352
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:16,728
Great. You drive.

353
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:17,479
What?

354
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:27,864
I wanna go home!

355
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,700
This is not what I meant!

356
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:40,554
Oh, no.

357
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:41,544
Look out, Special!

358
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:44,380
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry!

359
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,761
- Wow, he's amazing.
- Aah!

360
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:56,351
That was incredible!

361
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,853
You're even better
than the prophecy said you'd be.

362
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,271
Oh. Really?

363
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:02,148
I'm, uh... I'm Wyldstyle.

364
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,150
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?
- Wyldstyle.

365
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
- "Wyldstyle"?
- Yep.

366
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:06,778
- What are you, a DJ?
- No.

367
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:09,072
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?
- Yeah.

368
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:10,865
Like on your birth certificate,
it says "Wyldstyle."

369
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:11,783
Let's not talk about my name!

370
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,409
Don't let The Special get away.

371
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,900
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.

372
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:16,120
Hang on, sir!

373
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:18,036
What are you doing?

374
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:20,833
Let's fly!

375
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,835
Whoa!

376
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,629
Head for the secret tunnel.

377
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,359
Uh, these are the city limits.

378
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:28,102
Let's just head for the tunnel.

379
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,301
You want me to drive
into that weird swirly hole?

380
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,152
Are you insane?

381
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,096
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!

382
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,180
I can't do this!

383
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,849
That is against the instructions!

384
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,727
Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?

385
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:40,818
Any chain restaurant.

386
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,746
Favorite TV show?

387
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:42,272
Where Are My Pants?

388
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:43,083
Favorite song?

389
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,433
Everything Is Awesome

390
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,567
Oh, no!

391
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:56,953
Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn!

392
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:38,328
Wait. Where are we?

393
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,415
This is so weir...! Ow!

394
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,709
You're not The Special! You lied to me!

395
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,586
It really kind of depends on...

396
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:48,476
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you?

397
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:50,798
Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is.

398
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:54,010
Why don't you tell me what it is?
That way I could see if you're right.

399
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,512
You've ruined the prophecy.

400
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:00,016
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just...

401
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:02,477
You made being special sound so good.

402
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,480
And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.

403
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,523
You were?

404
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:08,983
Here's the thing.

405
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,736
How do we know for sure
that I'm not The Special?

406
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:13,446
We just don't know it yet.
Quiet.

407
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,281
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?

408
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:17,492
Do you have any idea
what that does to your colon?

409
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:22,872
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.
- Just put the hat on.

410
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:23,748
Oh...

411
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,667
...and this. And this. And this.

412
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,460
- And this.
- Aah!

413
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,337
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend.

414
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,673
Uh, I'm not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.

415
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:32,840
It's super serious.

416
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:34,509
You do not want to mess with him.

417
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,259
Okay.

418
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,678
So don't get any ideas.

419
00:19:36,928 --> 00:19:38,596
I never have any ideas.

420
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:40,264
Wait!

421
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:42,558
- Stick them up.
- Hands where I can see them.

422
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,889
Hey, uh, listen. You think
you can explain why I'm dressed like this...

423
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,480
...and what those big words
in the sky were all about?

424
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,191
And, like, where we are in time.

425
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:55,534
Your home, Bricksburg,
is one of many realms in the universe.

426
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:56,698
There's also this one...

427
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,467
...Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club,
Viking's Landing, Clown Town...

428
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:00,702
...a bunch of others
we don't need to mention.

429
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:01,536
Mm-hm.

430
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,587
Lord Business,
or as you think you know him...

431
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:04,872
...President Business...

432
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:07,959
...stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.

433
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:09,877
Blah, blah, blah.

434
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:12,922
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.

435
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,383
- ...Piece of Resistance is The Special.
Mm-hm.

436
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,010
I'm so pretty. I like you.

437
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,555
But I'm angry with you for some reason.

438
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,056
- ...tower at the end of the universe...
Mm-hm.

439
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,242
...put the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle...

440
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,893
...and disarm it forever.

441
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:27,103
Great.

442
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:28,396
I think I got it...

443
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:29,689
...but just in case...

444
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:32,019
...tell me the whole thing again.
I wasn't listening.

445
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:37,071
Okay. All the people
of the universe were once free to travel...

446
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:40,283
...and mingle and build
whatever they wanted.

447
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,660
But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.

448
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:45,496
So he erected walls between the worlds...

449
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:48,416
...and became obsessed
with order and perfection.

450
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,042
And he stole the mysterious...

451
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,173
- ...secret super weapon called...
- The Kragle!

452
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,778
...and he hired Bad Cop...

453
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:56,796
...to hunt down all the MasterBuilders,
who were always changing everything.

454
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:58,676
And those of us who remained...

455
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,555
...well, we went into hiding.
Built the tunnels to survive.

456
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,485
And we search for the Piece of Resistance.

457
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:07,310
The only thing that can stop the Kragle.

458
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,728
Kragle. I know that.

459
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:11,022
It might have been that cop.
He said something about the Kragle.

460
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,441
President Business
was going to use the Kragle...

461
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,052
...to end the world in three days.

462
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:16,353
I can't make any sense of it.

463
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:17,570
Taco Tuesday.

464
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,989
I knew that was suspicious.
There's no time to lose.

465
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,201
We must find Vitruvius and get to
the Office Tower before it's too late.

466
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:24,452
Okay.

467
00:21:24,702 --> 00:21:26,829
Heh. How scary can someone's office be?

468
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,369
President Business,
we're trying to locate the fugitive...

469
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:41,886
...but his face is so generic it matches
every other face in our database.

470
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,679
Diabolical.

471
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,891
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office...

472
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,742
- ...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.

473
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:50,728
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir.

474
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,298
Glad to hear it.
Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!

475
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:54,649
The roof team is on it.

476
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:57,109
Sir, can you approve this poster
for Taco Tuesday?

477
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,402
Perfect. Whoo!

478
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,653
- I love everyone in this room.
- We love you, sir!

479
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:03,074
- Great job on the radio station.
- Thank you, sir.

480
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,368
We love listening to this song
over and over again.

481
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:06,410
Keep it up, guys.

482
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,663
Honey, where are my...

483
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:10,056
...pants?
Ha-ha-ha!

484
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:11,123
Cut! Ha, ha!

485
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:13,000
Hilarious. That never gets old.

486
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:14,168
It does not.

487
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,754
Bad Cop is waiting for you
in your office.

488
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,256
Wonderful. Fantastic.

489
00:22:18,506 --> 00:22:20,299
Would you cancel my 2:00?

490
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,677
This next meeting could run a little bit...

491
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:23,928
...deadly.

492
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:32,895
Activate helmet.

493
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,481
Light sequence.

494
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,440
Flame test.

495
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:39,545
- Engage dramatic entrance.
- Aah!

496
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:40,945
Bad Cop.

497
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:43,197
Lord Business.
I know The Special got away, but...

498
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,199
Don't be so serious.

499
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:46,576
Where's the other guy?

500
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,661
- Hey, friend.
- Hey, buddy!

501
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,663
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?

502
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,640
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?

503
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:53,833
Nope. I don't think you have.

504
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,723
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.

505
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:56,794
This one...

506
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,504
...is the Cloak of Ban Da'Id.

507
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,314
I hear it's super painful to take off.

508
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,883
- You wanna try it on?
- Well, um...

509
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:03,593
No, but thank you.

510
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:06,345
We've done some great work
over the years together, Bad Cop...

511
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:08,472
...capturing all those MasterBuilders...

512
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:10,349
...and torturing them and whatnot.

513
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,309
Thank you, sir.

514
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,602
Although...

515
00:23:12,852 --> 00:23:14,186
...you did let the Piece of Resistance go.

516
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:16,063
The one thing that can ruin my plans.

517
00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:18,634
The one thing that I asked you to take care of.

518
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,860
That's super frustrating.

519
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,821
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever...

520
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,865
...is standing closest to me...

521
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,825
...and throw them through this window...

522
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:31,746
...and out into the infinite abyss
of nothingness!

523
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:36,667
I wanna do it so bad.

524
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,961
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

525
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:42,506
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

526
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:46,385
People everywhere
are always messing with my stuff.

527
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,472
But I have a way to fix that.

528
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:53,142
A way to keep things exactly
the way they are supposed to be.

529
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,478
Permanently.

530
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,313
Behold...

531
00:23:57,647 --> 00:23:59,482
...the most powerful weapon...

532
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:01,233
...of all the relics:

533
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,695
The Kragle!

534
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,386
As you can see, they're
loading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.

535
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,204
I call it...

536
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:15,957
...the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.

537
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,500
Or TAKOS.

538
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,960
The "S" is silent.

539
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,545
So on Taco Tuesday...

540
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,965
...it's going to spray the Kragle
over everyone and everything...

541
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:27,593
...with a bunch of super-scary nozzles
like this one!

542
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:30,805
- I'll show you how it works.
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

543
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:33,265
Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you.

544
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,017
I'll do it on your parents!

545
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:37,186
What?

546
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:38,896
- Hi, son.
- Hi!

547
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,648
How's it going in the big city?

548
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,025
Mommy. Daddy.
What are you doing here?

549
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,695
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally.

550
00:24:45,945 --> 00:24:47,989
- Like you're going about your day.
- Gotcha.

551
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:49,699
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

552
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:50,783
Ma, scoot...

553
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,702
...two steps in to the right.

554
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,870
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...
- Uh-huh?

555
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:56,247
- ...you start to move.
- Sorry, sir.

556
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:57,665
Get back to where you were!

557
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:58,624
- Here?
- Perfect.

558
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,252
That's great. You can't do anything better.
No reason why you should move.

559
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,003
Right.

560
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:02,753
Now, Ma...

561
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:04,505
...hand on his shoulder. And you...

562
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,091
- Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.

563
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,009
You wrecked it!

564
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:10,428
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?

565
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:14,432
All I'm asking for is total perfection.

566
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,100
Send in a Micro-manager!

567
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,396
Commencing micro-management.

568
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,931
Hold still, you guys.

569
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:28,571
And then...

570
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:30,072
...I just spray them...

571
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:31,532
...with the TAKOS.

572
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,452
Oh, Pa, hold me.

573
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,788
Oh, darling, I can't move my legs.

574
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,041
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...

575
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,544
Surely you feel bad for your parents,
and you wanna help them, don't you?

576
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,590
We're okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all.

577
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,425
Go ahead...

578
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,678
...finish the job.

579
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:54,221
Of course, sir.

580
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:55,556
No, I don't want to.

581
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,308
- You have to.
- I don't want to.

582
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,078
- Would you please be quiet?
- I can't.

583
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,661
- You must. Shut it!
- But they...

584
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,646
- It's not nice.
- It's your job, man.

585
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:04,023
I can't do it.

586
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,858
- They're innocent.
- Just as I thought.

587
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,861
Your Good Cop side's
making you soft, Bad Cop.

588
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:09,779
Robots!

589
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:12,406
Bring me the fleece-crested
Scepter of Q-Teep...

590
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:14,575
...and the Põ-Lish Remover of Na-II.

591
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,078
You've already let The Special
get away once.

592
00:26:17,328 --> 00:26:17,912
Sir.

593
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:20,206
I'm just gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.

594
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,625
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

595
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:28,881
Oh, son!

596
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:32,843
On Taco Tuesday,
I'm going to Kragleize the entire universe...

597
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:36,138
...so that everyone
will stop messing with my stuff!

598
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,015
Are you gonna be with me...

599
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,725
...or are you gonna be stuck...

600
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,895
...having a tea party
with your mom and dad?

601
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:43,938
Son?

602
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:46,273
Sorry, Dad.

603
00:26:47,817 --> 00:26:49,318
I have a job to do.

604
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,488
All you have to do is blend in
and act like you belong here.

605
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:10,548
Ah, perfect.

606
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,175
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!

607
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,705
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!

608
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,637
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun.

609
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,931
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.

610
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,267
- - What are they looking at?
- I made a mistake.

611
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:22,935
You should just be still. Act like a stool.

612
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,353
- Wait!
- Howdy, guys!

613
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,603
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.
- Come sit on me.

614
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:28,023
Okay, shh.

615
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:29,775
Let me show you how it's done.

616
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:36,073
What a lady!

617
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,161
Okay, let me just find the wizard...

618
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:42,204
...and get this over with.

619
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,670
- Ooh!
- There he is.

620
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:51,714
- Vitruvius.
- Who?

621
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,466
I've never heard of that man,
whom I am not.

622
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,343
- Who are you?
- It's me.

623
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,180
I am a blind man and cannot see.

624
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,431
- It's Wyldstyle.
- Oof.

625
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:01,640
Are you a DJ?

626
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:03,771
- What? Why does everybody...?
- Oh, wait, wait.

627
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,414
Are you the student I used to have...

628
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:07,271
...who was so insecure
she kept changing her name?

629
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,105
No, no, no.

630
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,732
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.
- No. Never.

631
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,942
Then Neversmile, then Freakface,
then Snazzypants.

632
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,068
Okay. All right, yes.

633
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,196
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.

634
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:25,789
Oh, man.

635
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,083
You have a very weirdly...

636
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:29,960
- ...decorated place.
- Thank you.

637
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,380
Vitruvius, we have found
the Piece of Resistance.

638
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:35,216
- Is it true?
- Yes, but...

639
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:37,593
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that...

640
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,511
...you are The Special.

641
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:42,139
The embodiment of good, foiler of evil.

642
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,308
The most talented, most brilliant...

643
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,394
...most important person in the universe.

644
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:49,897
That would be great...

645
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,326
...but Emmet is the one
who found the Piece.

646
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,401
Oh, okay. Emmet!

647
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:55,861
The prophecy states that...

648
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,738
...you are The Special.

649
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,449
- The most talented...
- I'm not sure he's The Special.

650
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,201
Because he's not even
a MasterBuilder. Watch.

651
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:03,971
Emmet, just given what's around you...

652
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:05,120
- ...build something simple.
- Okay.

653
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:06,288
- Like an awesome race car.
- Great.

654
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,040
- Go.
- Do you have the instructions?

655
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,710
No. You must create the instructions
in your mind, my liege.

656
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:14,296
Ah. Okay. Race car.

657
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,464
Um...

658
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,300
Well, there's a lot of really cool stuff here.

659
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,428
Don't see a wheel...

660
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,347
...or...

661
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:28,978
...three more wheels.

662
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,939
See? He can't do it.
He will never be a MasterBuilder.

663
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,483
Of course not.
Not if you keep telling him he can't.

664
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,235
He needs to see that he can.

665
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:37,403
What are you doing?

666
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,494
- We are entering your mind...
- What?

667
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,740
...to prove that you have
the unlocked potential...

668
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,409
...to be a MasterBuilder.

669
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:44,868
Ujjayi breath.

670
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,966
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?

671
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,838
- It's big. I must be smart.
Mm-hm.

672
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,757
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.

673
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:01,510
I don't think he's ever had an original thought.
In his life.

674
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,720
Ha, ha. That's not true.

675
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,805
For instance, one time I wanted to have...

676
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,016
...a bunch of my friends over to watch TV...

677
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,686
Not unlike this TV
that just showed up magically.

678
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,771
And not everybody
can fit on my one couch...

679
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:14,103
...and I thought to myself:

680
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:16,195
"What if there was such a thing
as a bunk bed...

681
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:17,443
...but as a couch?"

682
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,987
Introducing the double-decker couch.

683
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:23,073
So everyone could watch TV together
and be buddies!

684
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,989
That is literally the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

685
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,537
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this.

686
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,623
That idea is just the worst.

687
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:33,584
There must be something around here...

688
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,002
...that proves his potential.

689
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,671
If The Man Upstairs
chose him to be The Special...

690
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,048
...there must be a reason.

691
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:40,774
- Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?

692
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,526
He doesn't even know about
The Man Upstairs.

693
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:44,152
Does he have, like, super-gross hands...

694
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,379
...that look like they're made
out of big pink sausages?

695
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,390
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?

696
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,185
Wait. You've seen the...?

697
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:52,644
Whoa!

698
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:54,730
That's what I was just thinking about.

699
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,647
How did you...?

700
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,024
I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.

701
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,276
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

702
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,570
Emmet, you had a vision.

703
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,613
I did?

704
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,323
MasterBuilders spend years...

705
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,367
...training themselves
to clear their minds enough...

706
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,870
...to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...

707
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,791
...and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...

708
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,044
...that there is nothing in it
to clear away in the first place.

709
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,379
With proper training...

710
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,048
...you could become a great MasterBuilder.

711
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,216
I could?

712
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:24,718
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

713
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,929
But I can't do any of the stuff...

714
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,939
...that the prophecy
says I'm supposed to do.

715
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:32,768
All you have to do is to believe.

716
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,685
Then...

717
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,605
...you will see everything.

718
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,857
Are you ready, my son?

719
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,654
Yes, I am.

720
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,739
I think.

721
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,783
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

722
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,493
We must assemble...

723
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,495
...the MasterBuilders.

724
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:54,164
Do you think Zeppelins
are a bad investment?

725
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:08,846
Any of you fellas seen this guy?

726
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:12,878
Wait a minute, partner.

727
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,726
Draw a cowboy hat on him.

728
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:23,360
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.

729
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,112
They will go to an Internet café...

730
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,864
...and e-mail the remaining MasterBuilders...

731
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:30,159
...who will meet us in the secret realm
of Cloud Cuckooland.

732
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,995
Cuckooland? Wait.
What happened to that whole training part?

733
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,830
Don't worry, Emmet.

734
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,748
Your training begins now.

735
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,090
Piano man...

736
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,043
...open up.

737
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:41,753
Your training begins later!

738
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:44,965
On three.

739
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:45,966
One...

740
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:55,392
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.
- Freeze, turkeys.

741
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,353
All I want is the Piece of Resistance.

742
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:00,689
We would rather he died than give it to you.

743
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,233
I would not rather he died.

744
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,403
Look, everybody, we can do this
the easy way, or we can do it...

745
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:07,413
Go, run!

746
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:08,947
They took the hard way. Fire!

747
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:10,199
Fire!

748
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,280
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?

749
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,450
Head for the big bright thing in the sky.

750
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,289
- You mean the sun?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

751
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,707
Let's get out of here. Here, use this.

752
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:19,957
What? Wait, hey...

753
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,966
- What are you doing? Aah!
- Let's go!

754
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,047
I don't know what I'm doing.

755
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,301
Good bye.

756
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,677
Boom!

757
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,268
Oh, dang!

758
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,358
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!

759
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,276
Quit playing around in the mud.
I could use your help.

760
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,403
Wyldstyle, we could really use...

761
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:49,238
...your help!

762
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,447
Oink, oink, oink.

763
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:08,590
Oink!

764
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,676
Vitruvius, they're gaining on us.
Build something!

765
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,719
Let Emmet try!

766
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,514
No, let's not let Emmet try!
I haven't had any training.

767
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:16,348
That's okay.

768
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,600
We'll start with
how to become a MasterBuilder.

769
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,395
Step one: Trust your instincts.

770
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:22,437
Okay, okay. Um...

771
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,106
Build something! Build something!

772
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:25,524
Aha. Take that!

773
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,573
Unless your instincts are terrible.

774
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,746
No! The wheel!

775
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,296
I can't control it much longer!

776
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,632
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

777
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:51,466
Um...

778
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,719
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

779
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,762
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

780
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:58,515
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.

781
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,602
Something that spins around.
Spins around. Spins around.

782
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:03,312
Oh.

783
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,648
Emmet, where are you going?

784
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,277
Oh, this better work.

785
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:11,820
Hang tight!

786
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:15,532
Dagnabit!

787
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:18,702
Well done, Emmet.

788
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:20,662
Hey! I did it.

789
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,998
Wow. You actually did it.

790
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,209
Train!

791
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,052
Oh, no.

792
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,845
Get off my train.

793
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:38,055
Run!

794
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:44,227
Wyldstyle!

795
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,690
Owie!

796
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,067
He's gonna ram us.

797
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,361
Quick, quick, quick! That piece!
Give me that piece.

798
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:53,862
Huh?

799
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:55,614
Build a ramp!

800
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,913
What the heck?

801
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:04,748
Rest in pieces.

802
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:07,668
- Uh...
- Oh, no.

803
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:08,877
Wait. No, no, no.

804
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,261
Hey.

805
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,555
Thanks for saving my life back there.

806
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,182
Even if, you know...

807
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,560
...eventually it turned out to be pointless.

808
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,522
Well, for what it's worth...

809
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,858
...this has been about the greatest
15 minutes of my life.

810
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:39,366
What the...?

811
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,246
Relax, everybody, I'm here.

812
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,122
Batman!

813
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:46,733
- What's up, babe?
- Babe!

814
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,542
- What?
- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.

815
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,877
Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman.

816
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,587
I'm Batman.

817
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,549
That's your boyfriend? Aah!

818
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,219
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?

819
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,847
It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?

820
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,056
There he is.

821
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:05,392
- "Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.
- Batman!

822
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:06,309
The pleasure...

823
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,352
...is all "spine."

824
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:08,645
Guess what...

825
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:09,735
...you big dumb baby.

826
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,315
Your car is a baby carriage.

827
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,235
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.

828
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:16,528
- Hey, babe.
- What?

829
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:17,779
Let's hold hands.

830
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,075
So, uh...

831
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,578
Hey, guys, I think we're about
to crash into the sun.

832
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,913
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool.

833
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,630
Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland?
I don't see any clouds.

834
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,591
- Or cuckoos.
- No, no, this is...

835
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:38,633
...Middle Zealand.

836
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,177
A wondrous land...

837
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,947
...full of knights, castles, mutton...

838
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:44,347
...torture weapons, poverty,
leeches, illiteracy...

839
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:45,974
...and, um...

840
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,267
Dragon!

841
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:50,103
Yeah, that too.

842
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,358
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland,
we'll raise an army...

843
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:56,276
...of MasterBuilders to...

844
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:59,654
Anyway, you guys gotta check out
these new subwoofers I installed.

845
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,907
I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!

846
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:04,826
Can you turn that down a little bit?

847
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,662
This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.

848
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,289
Darkness

849
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,957
It's about how I'm an orphan.

850
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,709
No parents

851
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,461
This is real music, Emmet.

852
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,339
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding.

853
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,549
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.

854
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,676
Guys, look, a rainbow.

855
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,647
So you're gonna drive up the curved part...

856
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,429
Super rich

857
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,119
...take it all the way to the top...

858
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,599
Kind of makes it better

859
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,100
...and park the car.

860
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:33,146
Friends, welcome
to Cloud Cuckooland. Now...

861
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:38,819
I just need to give the secret knock.

862
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:51,873
Okay.

863
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,048
I'm just gonna come right out.

864
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:03,093
I have no idea what's going on,
or what this place is at all.

865
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:06,555
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...

866
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:10,058
...and I welcome you all
to Cloud Cuckooland.

867
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,604
There's no signs or anything.

868
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,773
How does anyone know what not to do?

869
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,233
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...

870
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,568
...there are no rules.

871
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:21,194
There's no government...

872
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:22,779
...no babysitters...

873
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,197
...no bedtimes...

874
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:25,991
...no frowny faces...

875
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:28,076
...no bushy mustaches...

876
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:30,537
...and no negativity of any kind.

877
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,747
You just said the word "no"
like a thousand times.

878
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:35,166
And there's also no consistency.

879
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,210
I hate this place.

880
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,337
Any idea is a good idea...

881
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:41,214
...except the not happy ones.

882
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:43,341
Those you push down deep inside...

883
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,802
...where you'll never, ever, ever...

884
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:46,636
...ever...

885
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,597
...find them.

886
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:51,224
Your fellow MasterBuilders
are gathered in the Dog.

887
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:52,601
The what?

888
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,897
Ah! Is that Superman?

889
00:39:58,231 --> 00:39:58,899
Girl, what are you doing?

890
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,984
- Hey, Superman!
- Oh, hey. What's up?

891
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:03,069
- Lantern. Green Lantern.
- Yeah, yeah.

892
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
You wanna sit together at the meeting?

893
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,616
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.

894
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:08,909
Didn't Krypton blow up?

895
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,329
My fellow MasterBuilders,
including but not limited to...

896
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,805
...Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady...

897
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,350
...Gandalf...

898
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:15,081
...Swamp Creature...

899
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:17,083
- ...1980-something Space Guy...
- Hello!

900
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,169
...2002 NBA All-Stars...

901
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,004
- ...and Wonder Woman.
- Unh!

902
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,549
You have traveled far to be here
for a moment of great import.

903
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,717
We have learned...

904
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,886
...that Lord Business plans to unleash...

905
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:29,721
...a fully weaponized Kragle...

906
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,431
...on Taco Tuesday...

907
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:34,059
...to end the world as we know it.

908
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,436
Please, calm yourselves.

909
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:37,247
Green Ninja...

910
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:37,998
...Milhouse...

911
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:38,908
...Nice Vampire...

912
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:40,427
...Michelangelo, Michelangelo...

913
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:41,650
...and Cleopatra.

914
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,610
There is yet one hope.

915
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,737
The Special has arisen.

916
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,240
Have the young man step forward.

917
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:50,492
As you wish, Dubbledore.

918
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:51,451
I'm Gandalf!

919
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,745
- It's pronounced "Dumbledore."
- Dubbadore?

920
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:55,246
No, "Dumbledore."

921
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:56,206
Thought you said "Dubbadore."

922
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,040
Vitruvius!

923
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,650
You gotta write that down.
I'm not gonna remember any of it.

924
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:00,961
But here we go.

925
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:06,174
The Special will now give
an eloquent speech.

926
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,055
Go ahead, man. You got this.

927
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:14,849
Okay.

928
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,525
Hello. I'm Emmet.

929
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:25,902
Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance.

930
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,579
Thank you.

931
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:39,916
Well, uh, I know that I, for one...

932
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,419
...am very excited to work with you guys...

933
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,629
...to get into the Octan Tower,
find the Kragle...

934
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:46,840
...and put this thing on the thing.

935
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,592
And I know it's going to be really hard, but...

936
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,094
"Really hard"?

937
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,807
Wiping ye burn with a hook
for a hand is really hard.

938
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:57,726
This be impossible.

939
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,812
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business' office...

940
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:03,231
...we used every plan we could conceive.

941
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:06,735
The result was a massacre
too terrible to speak of.

942
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:08,111
Who are you?

943
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,447
The name be Metal Beard.

944
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,199
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.

945
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,076
Oh, great, here we go again.

946
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:15,952
I arrived...

947
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,402
...at the foot of the Tower...

948
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,290
...with me hearty MasterBuilder crew...

949
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,544
...only to find the Kragle was all
the way up on the infinityeth floor...

950
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,130
guarded by a robot army...

951
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,461
...and security measures...

952
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,799
...of every kind...

953
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,176
...imaginable:

954
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:32,469
Lasers...

955
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,554
...sharks...

956
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,765
...laser sharks...

957
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,516
...overbearing assistants...

958
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:41,853
...and strange, dangerous relics...

959
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:42,896
...that entrap...

960
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:43,730
...snap...

961
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,939
...and zap.

962
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,110
And there be a mysterious room
called the Think Tank.

963
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:51,571
I barely made it out of that...

964
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:52,447
...room...

965
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:53,573
...with just me head!

966
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,744
And organs.

967
00:42:57,994 --> 00:42:58,661
Okay.

968
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,664
I had to replace every part
of my once-strapping...

969
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:03,333
...virile pirate body...

970
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:07,128
...with this useless hunk of garbage
ye see before ye.

971
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:11,007
So if ye think it'd be a good idea to return...

972
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,378
...to that forsaken place...

973
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,635
...Special...

974
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,929
...what idea have ye that be better...

975
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:17,722
...than the ideas of 100...

976
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:20,433
...of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers?

977
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:22,310
Well, uh...

978
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,438
Well, technically I'm not exactly
a MasterBuilder yet.

979
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:26,606
What?

980
00:43:28,024 --> 00:43:30,610
Please! Everyone! Please!

981
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:32,278
Rubbish!

982
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,155
Yes, it's true.

983
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:37,075
I may not be a MasterBuilder.

984
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:39,244
I may not have a lot of experience...

985
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:42,622
...fighting or leading
or coming up with plans.

986
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:45,166
Or having ideas in general.

987
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,962
In fact, I'm not all that smart.

988
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:52,841
And I'm not what you'd call
a "creative type."

989
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:54,551
Plus...

990
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,886
...generally unskilled.

991
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:58,930
Also...

992
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,850
...scared and cowardly.

993
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,394
I know what you're thinking:

994
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:07,021
"He is the least qualified person...

995
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:09,482
...in the world to lead us."

996
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:11,901
And you are right.

997
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:15,113
This is supposed to make us feel better?

998
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:17,532
No, there was about to be a "but."

999
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,617
- You're a butt!
- Yes.

1000
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:22,078
You all be on your own!

1001
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,831
I be leaving this lost cause!

1002
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,084
Why are you leaving?

1003
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:31,254
A house divided against itself
would be better...

1004
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:32,589
...than this.

1005
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,132
Abraham Lincoln!

1006
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:36,301
You bring your space chair right back here!

1007
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:38,178
Come on, guys!

1008
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:41,139
We can still do this. Right?

1009
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,016
You're not even a bit special.

1010
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,810
Well, you were right about him
being a ding-dong.

1011
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,645
You're a huge disappointment.

1012
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:51,107
Get him out of here.
I don't wanna look at him.

1013
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,905
Well, at least it can't get any worse.

1014
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:00,283
I was wrong.

1015
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,288
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!

1016
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,291
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.

1017
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,335
Whoa. How did he...?

1018
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:13,296
Go! Run! Come on, everyone!
Protect The Special.

1019
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:14,923
What's that on his ankle?

1020
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,717
It's a tracking device.

1021
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:19,928
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.

1022
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:21,679
Oh, he led them right to us.

1023
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,098
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault.

1024
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,435
You are the worst leader I've ever seen.
To the Batmobile!

1025
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:29,938
Dang it.

1026
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,189
To the invisible jet!

1027
00:45:33,107 --> 00:45:34,984
- Dang it!
- Every man for himself.

1028
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,028
No, we must protect the Piece.

1029
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:38,655
Shaq, do you know what time...

1030
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,782
- ...it is?
- It's game time.

1031
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,662
Y'all ready for this?

1032
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:49,374
Oh, no! They were ready for that.

1033
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:50,264
It didn't break!

1034
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,252
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!

1035
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:54,712
Fire!

1036
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:55,797
No!

1037
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:57,632
Aah! I can't move!

1038
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:58,816
Don't worry, Superman.

1039
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:00,442
- I'll get you out of there.
- No! Don't!

1040
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:04,514
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck.
My legs are stuck as well.

1041
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:05,765
I super hate you.

1042
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:09,352
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.
- Babe...

1043
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:10,478
...help me get him out of here.

1044
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:11,980
I said "every man for himself."

1045
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,856
Hey, you gotta be there for me.

1046
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:18,778
Fine!

1047
00:46:19,028 --> 00:46:20,530
Fine. Fine. Fine.

1048
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,657
- I need you to have a better attitude.
- I have a great...

1049
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,534
- ...attitude.
- Ouch.

1050
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:26,411
The Special's in the northwest quadrant.

1051
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:27,912
We've got him cornered.

1052
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:29,719
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

1053
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:30,873
Where'd he go?

1054
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:36,504
Oh, no!

1055
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:38,506
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!

1056
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,591
Let's go!
We need to get Emmet out of here.

1057
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:43,845
- Can't we build something?
- Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.

1058
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,335
I can build a spaceship. Watch.

1059
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,724
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship
Spaceship, spaceship

1060
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,851
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.

1061
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,145
That's okay. I didn't really wanna build...

1062
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,795
...a spaceship anyway. That's cool.

1063
00:46:53,896 --> 00:46:55,457
Where can we go
where we can't be found?

1064
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:57,168
Maybe we could go underwater?

1065
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,027
What if we went underwater?

1066
00:46:59,277 --> 00:46:59,986
Great idea, babe!

1067
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:01,916
Thank you, Batman.
Your ideas are the best.

1068
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:02,995
But I just said that.

1069
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:06,075
- We could build a submarine.
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.

1070
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,076
With rainbows!

1071
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:09,203
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap.

1072
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:10,788
Like an underwater spaceship!

1073
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,682
But you can't build all of them at once.

1074
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:14,083
Ready? Break.

1075
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:14,959
Okay.

1076
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:18,296
These are the colors I need: Blue razzleberry and sour apple!

1077
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:20,381
If anybody has black parts,
I need them, okay?

1078
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:21,758
I only work in black.

1079
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:24,010
And sometimes, very, very dark gray.

1080
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,428
- Use the yellow bricks!
- Hey, guys, can I help?

1081
00:47:25,678 --> 00:47:27,680
- No! It has to be this way!
- No, I need that!

1082
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,639
Where is he?

1083
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,059
Anyone know what this is,
and do you need it?

1084
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:33,202
I think we could use wings
and rocket boosters.

1085
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:34,729
Ew. Get your retro space stuff
out of my area.

1086
00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:37,940
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly
what to do. And how to do it.

1087
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:41,361
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.

1088
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:45,490
You must embrace
what is special about you!

1089
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:54,874
There he is!

1090
00:47:55,124 --> 00:47:57,085
All units, attack the sub!

1091
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:02,882
Emmet, get in here!

1092
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:10,556
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him...

1093
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:11,766
...get to the water!

1094
00:48:12,016 --> 00:48:13,256
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!

1095
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:14,143
We're going under!

1096
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:33,246
Oh, no.

1097
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:54,809
My home.

1098
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:58,479
It's gone.

1099
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,569
I feel something inside.

1100
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:06,821
It's like the opposite of happiness.

1101
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,575
I must stay positive.

1102
00:49:13,494 --> 00:49:14,370
Ah. Bubble gums.

1103
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,165
Butterflies.

1104
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:23,963
Cotton candy.

1105
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,883
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.

1106
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:31,137
Do you want to sit down
and talk about it?

1107
00:49:31,846 --> 00:49:35,516
What the heck is that?

1108
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,518
It's a double-decker couch.

1109
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:39,495
Which seemed like a good idea
at the time...

1110
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,857
...but I now realize it's not super helpful.

1111
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:45,651
But, you know, it has cup holders.

1112
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:48,446
Seats flip up with coolers underneath.

1113
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,575
You are so disappointing
on so many levels.

1114
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:55,578
- Why are my pants cold and wet?
- Ew.

1115
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:57,163
Uh...

1116
00:49:58,247 --> 00:49:58,831
Hull breach.

1117
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:00,166
The walls are crying!

1118
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,502
We're coming apart at the seams!

1119
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,213
This is not how Batman dies.

1120
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:07,423
Emmet!

1121
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,509
- Hold on, hold on!
- Wyldstyle!

1122
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,512
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod...!

1123
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:34,325
Micro-managers,
what's going on down there?

1124
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:37,161
Scanning submarine wreckage.

1125
00:50:38,246 --> 00:50:40,331
No survivors detected.

1126
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,584
Scuba cops,
dredge the entire ocean if you have to.

1127
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:45,753
We have got to find that Piece.

1128
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:47,964
Let's get these prisoners
back to Lord Business...

1129
00:50:48,214 --> 00:50:49,465
...and give him the good news.

1130
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:52,426
The Special is no more.

1131
00:50:56,806 --> 00:50:58,099
Hello, everybody!

1132
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:01,227
Superman. Wonder Woman,
I had no idea you'd be here.

1133
00:51:01,477 --> 00:51:02,770
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.

1134
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,855
Greetings, all!

1135
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:07,358
Welcome to my Think Tank.

1136
00:51:07,775 --> 00:51:09,694
Help us!

1137
00:51:09,944 --> 00:51:12,145
All the MasterBuilders
you've captured over the years...

1138
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:13,275
...you've brought them here.

1139
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:15,825
You're a very perceptive person, Superman.

1140
00:51:16,075 --> 00:51:19,370
They come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe.

1141
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:20,621
Robots!

1142
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,165
No! No! Grr!

1143
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:28,963
Can't get much worse than this.

1144
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:31,382
- Uh, hello, neighbor.
- Oh, no.

1145
00:51:31,632 --> 00:51:32,550
It's Green Lantern.

1146
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,886
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates!
How crazy is that?

1147
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:38,764
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
that they could give me?

1148
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:42,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special?

1149
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:45,521
The Special and the Piece of Resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean.

1150
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,523
Wait, are you telling me
you don't have him?

1151
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:51,402
Sir, my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak.

1152
00:51:51,652 --> 00:51:55,615
Bad Cop, he could still be alive!
The Piece could still be out there.

1153
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:59,327
The only remnant of The Special
was a double-decker couch.

1154
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,870
Wait, hold on.

1155
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,997
A double-decker couch?

1156
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:03,789
Yes, sir.

1157
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,960
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch?
Is that what it's like?

1158
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,420
That's weird.

1159
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,190
If you're sitting in the top middle...

1160
00:52:11,422 --> 00:52:13,782
...how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?

1161
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:16,177
If you're sitting on the bottom
and you're watching TV...

1162
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:19,055
...are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?

1163
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,057
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?

1164
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:22,558
It is literally...

1165
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:26,812
...the most useless idea
I have ever heard.

1166
00:52:29,815 --> 00:52:32,026
- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!

1167
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:34,445
Heh. The double-decker couch.

1168
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:36,405
It wasn't totally pointless after all.

1169
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:38,491
It's the one thing that stayed together.

1170
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:40,493
I always believed in you, Emmet.

1171
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,537
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...

1172
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:45,998
...we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?

1173
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:48,125
I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship...

1174
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:49,752
...is gonna come out of nowhere
and save us...

1175
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:51,087
My gosh!

1176
00:52:55,299 --> 00:52:57,259
Avast, mateys!

1177
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:07,228
Metal Beard, I thought you said
we were a lost cause!

1178
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:08,479
Ye are!

1179
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:10,606
Did ye not hear me whole story...

1180
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:14,068
...circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?

1181
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:16,654
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.

1182
00:53:16,904 --> 00:53:18,322
So why did you come back?

1183
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:20,950
This be-doubled land couch.

1184
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:25,871
I watched Lord Business' forces
completely overlook it.

1185
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:28,249
Which means we need more ideas like it!

1186
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:29,166
Oh, thank you.

1187
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:31,335
Ideas so dumb and bad...

1188
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:35,464
...that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful.

1189
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:37,299
Oh. Thank you.

1190
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,094
So, Special, what do we do?

1191
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:45,182
Uh...

1192
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:47,435
Well...

1193
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:51,814
...what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?

1194
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:52,784
Build a spaceship?

1195
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,540
Kill a chicken?

1196
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:54,525
Marry a marshmallow.

1197
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:55,359
Why, this:

1198
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:59,113
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm?

1199
00:53:59,363 --> 00:54:02,241
No! It's follow the instructions.

1200
00:54:03,617 --> 00:54:04,938
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.

1201
00:54:05,077 --> 00:54:06,996
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

1202
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:12,918
Guys, you're all so talented
and imaginative.

1203
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:16,505
But you can't work together as a team.

1204
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:19,633
I'm just a construction worker.

1205
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:22,845
But when I had a plan and we were
all working together...

1206
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:25,639
...I mean, we could build a skyscraper.

1207
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:30,478
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

1208
00:54:30,728 --> 00:54:34,732
Just imagine what could happen
if you did that.

1209
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,110
You could save the universe.

1210
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:41,280
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

1211
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:42,531
Really?

1212
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,075
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

1213
00:54:45,701 --> 00:54:46,702
Okay.

1214
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:50,664
Somebody get me some markers...

1215
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,502
...some construction paper...

1216
00:54:56,712 --> 00:54:59,340
...and some glitter glue!

1217
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:03,093
I call this:

1218
00:55:03,344 --> 00:55:05,429
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...

1219
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:07,181
...put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle...

1220
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:08,891
...and save the world."

1221
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:11,310
I've built a hundred just like them
back in the city.

1222
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:14,271
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.

1223
00:55:14,522 --> 00:55:15,439
I can get us anywhere.

1224
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:16,899
How will we get inside?

1225
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:18,734
In a spaceship.

1226
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:21,570
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

1227
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:23,948
No, they're expecting us to show up...

1228
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:27,409
...in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1229
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,021
One of those sounds awesome to me.

1230
00:55:29,036 --> 00:55:31,080
My idea is to build a spaceship...

1231
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,999
...that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.

1232
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,419
So not the special spaceship that
I'm building for all of you right now?

1233
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,046
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1234
00:55:39,296 --> 00:55:42,174
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen
out of my tank here.

1235
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:45,591
Yeah, but according
to your precious instructions...

1236
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,221
...this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1237
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:48,431
We don't have that part.

1238
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:49,557
Maybe we could find one!

1239
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:52,409
What do you think, a spaceship
is just gonna appear out of the blue?

1240
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,519
Are you kidding me?

1241
00:55:53,769 --> 00:55:54,854
The same thing!

1242
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:00,401
- Chewie!
- Mm!

1243
00:56:00,651 --> 00:56:03,028
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!

1244
00:56:03,279 --> 00:56:04,947
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning...

1245
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:06,991
...taking us to loser systems like this.

1246
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:08,784
Captain Solo, we must go.

1247
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:11,074
You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.

1248
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:12,454
The Droid's right. Let's roll.

1249
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:14,331
Now hold on, Han.

1250
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:17,001
This might be the right galaxy after all.

1251
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:19,545
Because I see a heavenly body.

1252
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:23,299
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?

1253
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:24,884
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!

1254
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:27,052
- Got room for just one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!

1255
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:29,346
If he's a cool dude like you.

1256
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:30,718
You're trying to bail on us!

1257
00:56:30,931 --> 00:56:31,557
I'm not trying to bail!

1258
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,559
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!

1259
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:35,329
That thing is filled with bon vivants.

1260
00:56:35,352 --> 00:56:36,192
You speak French now?

1261
00:56:36,437 --> 00:56:39,565
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...

1262
00:56:39,815 --> 00:56:41,191
...I need to feel free to party...

1263
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:43,235
...with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.

1264
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:43,986
What?

1265
00:56:44,236 --> 00:56:44,945
Babe!

1266
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:47,990
I will text you.

1267
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,452
Where'd you get that
sweet space cape, brother?

1268
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:54,705
It's party time!

1269
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:56,832
Babe?

1270
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:09,094
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person.

1271
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:13,349
And, you know,
if Batman can't see that, then he's just...

1272
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,603
Well, he's just as blind as a guy...

1273
00:57:18,187 --> 00:57:20,731
...whose eyes stopped working.

1274
00:57:21,982 --> 00:57:23,525
And I'm gonna tell you something:

1275
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:26,111
Batman is the worst person I've ever met.

1276
00:57:26,362 --> 00:57:28,113
- Need a hyperdrive?
- No way.

1277
00:57:28,364 --> 00:57:29,990
- Babe!
- I knew it! I knew that.

1278
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,492
You really had me there!

1279
00:57:31,742 --> 00:57:34,495
Those guys were so lame.
All they did was play space checkers.

1280
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:36,538
Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude.

1281
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:38,332
And the metal one too. All dudes.

1282
00:57:38,582 --> 00:57:40,542
But won't they notice
their hyperdrive is missing?

1283
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:43,879
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive.

1284
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:48,008
Nah, they'll be fine.

1285
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,221
Step one:

1286
00:57:52,471 --> 00:57:55,808
All right, we need a red four-piece
unit over at the...

1287
00:57:56,058 --> 00:57:56,642
Unikitty...

1288
00:57:56,892 --> 00:57:59,979
you're supposed to follow
the instructions, remember?

1289
00:58:00,229 --> 00:58:00,854
Sorry.

1290
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:02,356
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.

1291
00:58:02,606 --> 00:58:04,149
What do I even...? I can't...!

1292
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:08,529
Nice!

1293
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:09,822
Step two:

1294
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:11,490
We pilot the ship to the service entrance...

1295
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,659
...so we can get past the dangerous...

1296
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:15,285
...but also kind of cool...

1297
00:58:15,536 --> 00:58:16,578
...laser gate.

1298
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:18,414
Space ID.

1299
00:58:18,664 --> 00:58:19,581
I have a drive-on.

1300
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:21,041
Who are you here to see?

1301
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:22,710
I'm here to see Your Butt.

1302
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,337
Is that last name "Butt,"
first name "Your," or is it...?

1303
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:26,171
Oh, my gosh!

1304
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:31,927
Pow. Wham. Ka-zap.

1305
00:58:36,265 --> 00:58:37,307
First try!

1306
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:41,645
Step three: We break into Lord Business' office...

1307
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:44,314
...and we'll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises.

1308
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:46,066
Step four:

1309
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:47,526
Benny and Metal Beard...

1310
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:49,069
will sneak their way
into the master control room.

1311
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:51,405
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.

1312
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:52,281
10-4.

1313
00:58:53,073 --> 00:58:53,657
Uh-oh.

1314
00:58:58,037 --> 00:59:00,205
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh!

1315
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:01,665
Do it.

1316
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:07,453
Metal Beard, that was awesome!

1317
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:09,339
First law of the sea...

1318
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,760
...never place your rear end
on a pirate's face.

1319
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,362
Once inside,
they'll use their technical know-how...

1320
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:16,667
...to disable the Kragle shield.

1321
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:17,848
I am the computer.

1322
00:59:18,098 --> 00:59:20,267
Cool! Talking computer.

1323
00:59:20,517 --> 00:59:23,687
Please disable the shield systems.

1324
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:25,064
Of course.

1325
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:27,691
There are no movies
in your area with that title.

1326
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:29,818
Step five:

1327
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:32,362
Vitruvius will provide lookout
and make sure we're not being followed.

1328
00:59:32,613 --> 00:59:33,739
Okay.

1329
00:59:34,364 --> 00:59:36,950
Step six: Batman and Unikitty go into the boardroom...

1330
00:59:37,201 --> 00:59:39,453
...to make one last change
to Lord Business' plan.

1331
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:42,456
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that?

1332
00:59:42,706 --> 00:59:43,373
BRUCE I second.

1333
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:46,085
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

1334
00:59:46,335 --> 00:59:48,921
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?

1335
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:51,381
Sounds like a cool guy.

1336
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:54,823
We'd like to invest in your company.

1337
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:57,387
Your weapon to control
the universe sounds super sweet...

1338
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:59,807
- ...I must say.
- It is, indeed, super sweet.

1339
01:00:00,057 --> 01:00:02,559
Cool. What kind of sound system
does it have?

1340
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,604
Uh, sound system?
Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle.

1341
01:00:05,854 --> 01:00:06,772
Wait a second.

1342
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:08,899
You're telling me you have
a machine to control the universe...

1343
01:00:09,149 --> 01:00:11,149
...and you can't listen to tunes
in surround sound?

1344
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,277
Embarrassing.

1345
01:00:12,528 --> 01:00:13,487
Well, I mean...

1346
01:00:13,737 --> 01:00:15,938
...we need to get that done.
I want eight-foot speakers.

1347
01:00:16,073 --> 01:00:16,740
Great call.

1348
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:20,035
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug
with your arms and your legs...

1349
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:21,829
...and just feel the beat.

1350
01:00:22,871 --> 01:00:26,416
Listen up! We need new instructions
for a speaker system for the TAKOS.

1351
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:27,584
We'll never help.

1352
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:28,836
Whatever you say, boss.

1353
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,560
Then once the instructions are printed...

1354
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:33,799
Wyldstyle and I
will enter the Kragle room...

1355
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:35,801
...place the thing on the other thing...

1356
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:37,845
...and save the universe.

1357
01:00:38,095 --> 01:00:40,615
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?

1358
01:00:40,848 --> 01:00:42,349
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?

1359
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:45,477
When you reunite the Piece
with the Kragle, it might explode?

1360
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:47,521
No! But it might not, right?

1361
01:00:48,689 --> 01:00:51,150
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that.

1362
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:54,027
Attention, everybody!
Incoming speaker delivery!

1363
01:01:02,578 --> 01:01:03,704
Ow!

1364
01:01:04,496 --> 01:01:05,414
Who are you two?

1365
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:07,875
We are transfers from downstairs.

1366
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,042
- What?
- Excuse me?

1367
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:12,271
Your robot voice
sounds an awful lot like a human voice.

1368
01:01:12,296 --> 01:01:14,298
Give me a break.
I've never been a robot before.

1369
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:16,592
What do you mean?
You have always been a robot!

1370
01:01:16,842 --> 01:01:18,719
No, no, no, do not listen to her.

1371
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:20,721
What are your robot serial numbers?

1372
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:28,937
Everything is awesome

1373
01:01:29,938 --> 01:01:31,648
No way. This is my jam.

1374
01:01:31,899 --> 01:01:33,483
This is also my jam.

1375
01:01:33,734 --> 01:01:35,444
Everything is awesome

1376
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:37,821
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

1377
01:01:38,071 --> 01:01:40,752
- Needs great harmonies.
- I don't want to sing the song. I'm not...

1378
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:43,243
Everything is awesome

1379
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:46,914
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team

1380
01:01:47,164 --> 01:01:49,499
Everything is awesome

1381
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,419
When we're living our dream

1382
01:01:53,003 --> 01:01:54,046
Quick, let's go.

1383
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:55,547
Everything is awesome

1384
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:57,507
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.

1385
01:01:57,758 --> 01:01:58,717
I don't.

1386
01:01:59,218 --> 01:02:00,427
Mm-hm.

1387
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:03,263
I know you put on this tough act...

1388
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:04,973
...but I don't think you're as mean
as you're trying to seem.

1389
01:02:05,224 --> 01:02:06,558
I'm not mean. What are you talking about?

1390
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:09,561
I'm just saying, you were all,
"He's not The Special, Vitruvius.

1391
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:12,606
He can't possibly be The Special.
This guy? Are you kidding me?"

1392
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:16,318
Anyways, I don't think that's you.

1393
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:18,237
The real you, anyway.

1394
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,121
Look, Emmet.

1395
01:02:29,289 --> 01:02:31,458
I wanted it to be me, okay?

1396
01:02:32,668 --> 01:02:34,253
I wanted to be The Special.

1397
01:02:34,878 --> 01:02:38,382
And I know that sounds super mature.
It's just...

1398
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:42,135
...ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the One.

1399
01:02:43,262 --> 01:02:45,639
I was right there in that construction site...

1400
01:02:46,265 --> 01:02:48,308
...right on top of it, and then...

1401
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:51,270
...it turned out to be you.

1402
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:01,071
That night in the city,
when you thought I was The Special...

1403
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:07,411
...and you said I was talented
and important...

1404
01:03:08,787 --> 01:03:11,623
...that was the first time anyone
had ever really told me that.

1405
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:14,468
And it made me
wanna do everything I could...

1406
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:16,545
...to be the guy you were talking about.

1407
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:20,966
Lucy.

1408
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:22,384
What?

1409
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:24,886
That was my real name.

1410
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:27,681
You asked earlier, and it's...

1411
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,058
...Lucy.

1412
01:03:33,645 --> 01:03:35,063
I really like that name.

1413
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:39,776
Hey.

1414
01:03:40,027 --> 01:03:41,945
- What are you two losers talking about?
- Huh? What? Oh, nothing.

1415
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:44,948
Thought I'd help you guys.
Left the weird cat thing to stall.

1416
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:47,242
Business, business, business. Numbers.

1417
01:03:47,492 --> 01:03:49,161
- - Is this working?
- Yes.

1418
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:50,162
Yay!

1419
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:51,705
There's Bad Cop.

1420
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:55,542
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes...

1421
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:57,544
Okay. Wait for my signal.

1422
01:03:57,794 --> 01:03:59,212
Good luck, Emmet.

1423
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:00,714
Lucy.

1424
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:03,675
I guess this might be goodbye.

1425
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:07,304
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:

1426
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:09,639
"See you later, alligator."

1427
01:04:10,307 --> 01:04:12,517
"See you later, alligator"?

1428
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:16,521
After a while, crocodile.

1429
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:20,734
Who's Lucy?

1430
01:04:20,984 --> 01:04:22,545
Batman, when we get inside this room...

1431
01:04:22,652 --> 01:04:24,112
...there are gonna be
audio sensors everywhere.

1432
01:04:24,363 --> 01:04:26,239
We have to be really, really quiet.

1433
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,409
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb
instructions. Stop yelling at me.

1434
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:30,952
Benny, what's our status with the shield?

1435
01:04:31,203 --> 01:04:32,443
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.

1436
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:34,956
It's just going great,
if somebody would listen to me!

1437
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,334
Downloading latest episode
of Where Are My Pants?

1438
01:04:37,584 --> 01:04:40,087
Where are you
getting “pants” from? You know what I want!

1439
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:41,617
The pipes are calling...

1440
01:04:42,464 --> 01:04:43,090
Bad Cop.

1441
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,133
Hi, this is Lord Business' assistant.

1442
01:04:45,384 --> 01:04:47,424
He would like you to come
to his office immediately.

1443
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:48,312
Copy that.

1444
01:04:48,428 --> 01:04:50,263
- Thanks.
- You are welcome, sir.

1445
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,601
Hey, who is that?

1446
01:04:57,854 --> 01:04:58,855
That's the signal...

1447
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:01,024
...but the shield is still up.

1448
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,609
We'll wing it.

1449
01:05:03,777 --> 01:05:05,612
That's a bat pun.

1450
01:05:07,864 --> 01:05:08,865
Shh. Benny...

1451
01:05:09,116 --> 01:05:10,575
...disable the shield.

1452
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:11,907
- Disable the shield.
- Now.

1453
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:13,161
Disable the shield.

1454
01:05:13,412 --> 01:05:15,172
- Searching for Albanian restaurants.
- What?

1455
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:18,517
- No! I never once said anything...!
- I don't understand what you mean.

1456
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:19,668
Disable the shield!

1457
01:05:19,918 --> 01:05:20,877
Benny, what's going on?

1458
01:05:21,128 --> 01:05:22,587
Disable the shield! Come on!

1459
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:24,297
You are undermining me!

1460
01:05:24,548 --> 01:05:26,383
Which phrase
would you like me to underline?

1461
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:27,676
Disable the shield!

1462
01:05:27,926 --> 01:05:29,136
Let me try.

1463
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:33,473
Be ye disabling of yon shield.

1464
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:34,433
Disabling shield.

1465
01:05:34,683 --> 01:05:35,308
What?

1466
01:05:39,271 --> 01:05:41,815
Okay, in three...

1467
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:44,359
...two...

1468
01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:46,987
...one.

1469
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:49,781
Let's do this.

1470
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:51,950
Lucy!

1471
01:05:55,287 --> 01:05:55,787
Lucy!

1472
01:05:57,581 --> 01:05:58,582
No!

1473
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:01,460
Oh, man.

1474
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:02,919
Oh, no.

1475
01:06:03,503 --> 01:06:04,087
Uh-oh.

1476
01:06:04,504 --> 01:06:07,257
Sneaking around the corner...

1477
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,844
- Unh!
- Vitruvius.

1478
01:06:11,094 --> 01:06:14,514
I see you've accidentally
wandered into my Think Tank.

1479
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:16,933
And by the way,
I found a few of your friends.

1480
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:20,061
- By which I mean all of them!
- Sorry!

1481
01:06:20,312 --> 01:06:21,980
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.

1482
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:22,898
Thank you, sir.

1483
01:06:23,148 --> 01:06:25,734
Robots, destroy this old man at once.

1484
01:06:25,984 --> 01:06:27,277
Did you just call me "old"?

1485
01:06:27,527 --> 01:06:28,737
Yeah. So what?

1486
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:32,532
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word...

1487
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:33,783
..."experienced"!

1488
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:50,592
Aha.

1489
01:06:50,842 --> 01:06:51,635
You see, Emmet?

1490
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,096
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagina...

1491
01:06:58,767 --> 01:06:59,888
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Vitruvius!

1492
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,561
No!

1493
01:07:03,897 --> 01:07:04,898
Vitruvius.

1494
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:09,069
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.

1495
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:11,655
You must know something
about the prophecy.

1496
01:07:11,905 --> 01:07:13,657
I know, I'm doing my best...

1497
01:07:13,907 --> 01:07:14,616
...but I don't...

1498
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:16,284
The prophecy...

1499
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:18,036
I made it up.

1500
01:07:18,537 --> 01:07:19,579
What?

1501
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:22,791
I made it up. It's not true.

1502
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,293
But that means I'm just...

1503
01:07:25,794 --> 01:07:27,295
I'm not The Special?

1504
01:07:27,837 --> 01:07:28,797
You must listen.

1505
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:31,258
What I'm about to tell you...

1506
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:34,135
...will change the course of history.

1507
01:07:38,473 --> 01:07:39,808
No.

1508
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,643
No.

1509
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:51,403
Hey.

1510
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:53,321
Not so special anymore, huh?

1511
01:07:55,949 --> 01:07:56,992
Well, guess what.

1512
01:07:57,242 --> 01:07:59,536
No one ever told me I was special.

1513
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:03,123
I never got a trophy just for showing up!

1514
01:08:03,373 --> 01:08:06,543
I'm not some special little snowflake...

1515
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:07,752
...no.

1516
01:08:08,003 --> 01:08:10,130
But as unspecial as I am...

1517
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:13,425
...you are a thousand-billion times...

1518
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:15,135
...more unspecial than me.

1519
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:18,471
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero.

1520
01:08:18,722 --> 01:08:20,015
Yes, Lord Business.

1521
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:22,225
It must be weird.

1522
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:26,187
One minute, you're the most
special person in the universe.

1523
01:08:26,438 --> 01:08:29,482
And the next minute, you're nobody.

1524
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:34,654
Oh, I have a nice spot
for this in my relic room.

1525
01:08:35,363 --> 01:08:36,990
Uh-oh! My mistake!

1526
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,700
There it goes!

1527
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:39,451
No!

1528
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:41,661
Bye-bye forever!

1529
01:08:41,911 --> 01:08:45,707
Well, I guess
there's only one thing left to do!

1530
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:49,586
Release the Kragle!

1531
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:52,839
- Computer!
- Yes, sir.

1532
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:55,250
Set the electric shocker to 100 Mississippi.

1533
01:08:55,342 --> 01:08:56,092
No problem.

1534
01:08:56,343 --> 01:08:58,386
- Then terminate everyone.
- Already on it.

1535
01:08:58,637 --> 01:09:00,597
Emmet, that should give you enough time...

1536
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:02,727
...to witness the first location to be Kragled.

1537
01:09:02,932 --> 01:09:04,434
- Your hometown.
- No!

1538
01:09:04,684 --> 01:09:07,621
Bad Cop, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to leave you here to die.

1539
01:09:07,646 --> 01:09:08,730
What? Sir.

1540
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,482
It's not personal.

1541
01:09:10,732 --> 01:09:12,651
It's just business.

1542
01:09:13,193 --> 01:09:15,236
Lord Business.

1543
01:09:15,487 --> 01:09:16,738
Ciao.

1544
01:09:18,323 --> 01:09:20,283
Beginning zapping termination...

1545
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,202
...in 99 Mississippi...

1546
01:09:22,452 --> 01:09:24,204
...98 Mississippi...

1547
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:26,206
97 Mississippi...

1548
01:09:26,873 --> 01:09:27,957
...and so on.

1549
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:49,396
Attention, everyone.

1550
01:09:50,313 --> 01:09:52,315
This is President Business.

1551
01:09:53,817 --> 01:09:54,609
Hello.

1552
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:56,861
- Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!
- Whoa.

1553
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:59,698
Don't worry about this big black...

1554
01:09:59,948 --> 01:10:01,866
...monolith thing that's blocking out the sun.

1555
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:03,857
What you need to worry about...

1556
01:10:04,077 --> 01:10:06,496
...is this question that I'm about to ask you:

1557
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:09,124
Who wants a taco?

1558
01:10:12,085 --> 01:10:13,461
Yeah! I know!

1559
01:10:13,712 --> 01:10:16,131
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah.

1560
01:10:16,631 --> 01:10:18,216
All right, everyone.

1561
01:10:18,466 --> 01:10:19,843
Act normal.

1562
01:10:21,845 --> 01:10:22,929
Perfect.

1563
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:25,765
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"

1564
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:32,480
So I guess running around
and screaming is normal.

1565
01:10:32,731 --> 01:10:35,316
Micro-managers,
commence micro-management.

1566
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:37,986
Commencing micro-management.

1567
01:10:39,988 --> 01:10:42,073
What's going on? I can't move!

1568
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:47,162
Please, please! Won't somebody help us?

1569
01:10:47,412 --> 01:10:51,291
Emmet, you'll think of something,
right? Like you always do.

1570
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,960
Didn't you hear him?

1571
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,004
The prophecy's made-up.

1572
01:10:57,088 --> 01:10:58,798
I'm not The Special.

1573
01:10:59,799 --> 01:11:02,510
And to think for a moment
I thought I might be.

1574
01:11:04,471 --> 01:11:06,890
- Emmet.
- Who said that?

1575
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,391
I did.

1576
01:11:08,641 --> 01:11:11,436
I am Ghost Vitruvius.

1577
01:11:11,686 --> 01:11:14,522
Woo!

1578
01:11:15,023 --> 01:11:17,734
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier.

1579
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:19,360
Because I died.

1580
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:21,237
The reason I made up the prophecy...

1581
01:11:21,488 --> 01:11:23,948
...was because I knew that
whoever found the Piece...

1582
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,825
...could become The Special.

1583
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:28,745
Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special...

1584
01:11:28,995 --> 01:11:31,539
...is to believe that you can be.

1585
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:35,251
I know that sounds like a cat poster,
but it's true.

1586
01:11:36,044 --> 01:11:39,547
Look at what you did
when you believed you were special.

1587
01:11:39,798 --> 01:11:42,217
You just need to believe it some more.

1588
01:11:42,467 --> 01:11:45,720
But how can I just decide
to believe that I'm special...

1589
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,013
...when I'm not?

1590
01:11:48,348 --> 01:11:51,059
Because the world depends on it.

1591
01:11:53,102 --> 01:11:55,939
Woo!

1592
01:11:56,189 --> 01:11:58,900
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi...

1593
01:11:59,150 --> 01:11:59,734
What?

1594
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:01,110
...34 Mississippi...

1595
01:12:01,986 --> 01:12:03,112
...33 Mississippi...

1596
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:05,323
...32 Mississippi...

1597
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,909
...31 Mississippi...

1598
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:09,577
...30 Mississippi...

1599
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:11,663
...29 Mississippi...

1600
01:12:11,913 --> 01:12:14,165
...28 Mississippi, 27 Mississippi...

1601
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:17,510
...26 Mississippi...

1602
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,255
...25 Mississippi...

1603
01:12:20,505 --> 01:12:21,306
...24 Mississippi...

1604
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:30,765
Emmet!

1605
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:31,933
What are you...?

1606
01:12:32,183 --> 01:12:33,643
18 Mississippi...

1607
01:12:33,893 --> 01:12:35,979
- ...17 Mississippi...
- Oh!

1608
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:37,730
- ...16 Mississippi...
- Lucy!

1609
01:12:37,981 --> 01:12:39,874
- ...15 Mississippi...
- Wait! What are you...?

1610
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:41,776
Now it's your turn to be the hero.

1611
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:43,653
- 13 Mississippi...
- No!

1612
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:45,363
12 Mississippi...

1613
01:12:45,613 --> 01:12:47,282
See you later, alligator.

1614
01:12:47,532 --> 01:12:48,157
Don't!

1615
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:52,161
No, Emmet!

1616
01:12:52,412 --> 01:12:54,664
- Aah!
- 7 Mississippi...

1617
01:12:54,914 --> 01:12:56,291
6 Mississippi...

1618
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,376
...5 Mississippi...

1619
01:12:58,626 --> 01:12:59,919
...4 Mississippi...

1620
01:13:00,545 --> 01:13:01,921
...3 Mississippi...

1621
01:13:02,547 --> 01:13:03,631
...2 Mississippi...

1622
01:13:04,757 --> 01:13:05,397
1 Mississippi...

1623
01:13:06,301 --> 01:13:07,719
...0 Missi... Error.

1624
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:09,470
Termination failure.

1625
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:11,222
Emmet!

1626
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:20,106
No.

1627
01:13:26,154 --> 01:13:28,740
He... He saved us.

1628
01:13:29,866 --> 01:13:31,242
Well, what do we do now?

1629
01:13:31,492 --> 01:13:32,813
There's gotta be a bright side...

1630
01:13:33,036 --> 01:13:33,756
...here somewhere.

1631
01:13:33,995 --> 01:13:35,538
Does anyone have any ideas?

1632
01:13:36,456 --> 01:13:37,999
Emmet had ideas.

1633
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:42,253
Arr, if only there were more people
in the world like he.

1634
01:13:46,799 --> 01:13:48,134
Maybe there are.

1635
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:50,178
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.

1636
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:54,182
Honey, where are my...

1637
01:13:54,432 --> 01:13:56,225
...pant...?

1638
01:13:56,726 --> 01:13:58,006
- Hi!
- Hey, guess what.

1639
01:13:58,019 --> 01:14:00,438
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny...

1640
01:14:00,688 --> 01:14:02,941
...send this out to everyone in the universe.

1641
01:14:03,191 --> 01:14:04,943
1980-something technology?

1642
01:14:05,193 --> 01:14:06,569
Now you're talking!

1643
01:14:09,489 --> 01:14:12,367
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody.

1644
01:14:12,617 --> 01:14:16,204
You don't know me,
but I'm on TV, so you can trust me.

1645
01:14:16,454 --> 01:14:18,915
I know things seem kind of bad right now.

1646
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:21,584
But there is a way out of this.

1647
01:14:22,585 --> 01:14:24,087
This is Emmet.

1648
01:14:24,587 --> 01:14:26,464
And he was just like all of you.

1649
01:14:26,714 --> 01:14:28,174
A face in the crowd...

1650
01:14:28,424 --> 01:14:30,468
...following the same instructions as you.

1651
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,055
He was so good at fitting in,
no one ever saw him.

1652
01:14:34,722 --> 01:14:36,307
And I owe you an apology...

1653
01:14:36,808 --> 01:14:38,935
...because I used to look down
on people like that.

1654
01:14:39,185 --> 01:14:41,854
"I used to think they were followers...

1655
01:14:42,105 --> 01:14:44,691
...with no ideas or vision."

1656
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:47,235
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas.

1657
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:49,612
And even though they seemed weird...

1658
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,861
...and kind of pointless...

1659
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,533
...they actually came closer...

1660
01:14:53,783 --> 01:14:56,285
...than anyone else to saving the universe.

1661
01:14:56,619 --> 01:14:59,455
And now we have to finish what he started...

1662
01:14:59,706 --> 01:15:03,042
...by making whatever weird thing
pops into our heads.

1663
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:06,337
All of you have the ability
inside of you to be a groundbreaker.

1664
01:15:06,587 --> 01:15:07,797
And I mean literally!

1665
01:15:08,673 --> 01:15:09,924
Break the ground!

1666
01:15:10,174 --> 01:15:11,092
Peel up the pieces...

1667
01:15:11,342 --> 01:15:12,343
...tear apart your walls!

1668
01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:14,303
Build things only you could build.

1669
01:15:14,554 --> 01:15:15,680
Defend yourselves.

1670
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:18,599
We need to fight back
against President Business'...

1671
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:20,852
plans to freeze us!

1672
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:24,022
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.

1673
01:15:24,522 --> 01:15:27,567
It will be known as Freedom Friday!

1674
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:31,487
But still on a Tuesday!

1675
01:15:38,244 --> 01:15:39,912
End of the line.

1676
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:43,750
Bad Cop?

1677
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,085
I hope there's still a Good Cop
in me somewhere.

1678
01:15:47,962 --> 01:15:51,883
I'll hold these guys off.
You go stop them. Yay!

1679
01:15:52,133 --> 01:15:54,552
Great idea, but how will we get there?

1680
01:15:54,802 --> 01:15:56,679
T-minus one.

1681
01:15:56,929 --> 01:15:59,182
Ten, nine, eight...

1682
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:00,793
- ...seven, six...
- I could, uh...

1683
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:03,037
- ...five, four...
- I could build a...

1684
01:16:03,686 --> 01:16:04,446
...three, two, one.

1685
01:16:05,313 --> 01:16:06,689
I could build a spaceship!

1686
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,693
You're not gonna say no?

1687
01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:12,695
Build away, whatever your name is.

1688
01:16:12,945 --> 01:16:14,405
- Whoa! Yay!
- Ha-ha-ha!

1689
01:16:17,158 --> 01:16:19,243
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!

1690
01:16:22,205 --> 01:16:23,039
Spaceship!

1691
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:25,333
Spaceship!

1692
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:26,542
Spaceship!

1693
01:16:26,793 --> 01:16:27,752
Spaceship!

1694
01:16:28,002 --> 01:16:29,170
Spaceship!

1695
01:16:29,879 --> 01:16:30,505
Spaceship!

1696
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:31,631
Spaceship!

1697
01:16:31,881 --> 01:16:33,341
All units, attack that spaceship.

1698
01:16:35,134 --> 01:16:35,802
Spaceship!

1699
01:16:37,512 --> 01:16:38,073
Where'd he go?

1700
01:16:38,262 --> 01:16:39,055
Spaceship!

1701
01:16:42,141 --> 01:16:43,262
Wyldstyle, look...

1702
01:16:43,434 --> 01:16:45,561
...it's the citizens!

1703
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:52,527
Tallyho!

1704
01:16:53,152 --> 01:16:54,445
Yee-haw!

1705
01:16:54,695 --> 01:16:57,156
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.

1706
01:16:57,406 --> 01:16:59,283
What is going on?

1707
01:16:59,534 --> 01:17:00,743
You stop...

1708
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:02,078
...building that stuff!

1709
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:03,412
Just stop it!

1710
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:08,434
Great job!

1711
01:17:08,668 --> 01:17:09,752
This might actually work.

1712
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:12,964
'Twas your speech
which roused this hearty crew.

1713
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:15,925
If only Emmet were here to see this.

1714
01:17:16,175 --> 01:17:18,344
He'd say something adorable like...

1715
01:17:22,723 --> 01:17:24,976
Am I just gonna keep...

1716
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:26,227
...falling...

1717
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:30,189
...forever?

1718
01:17:41,492 --> 01:17:43,161
Is this another vision?

1719
01:17:45,913 --> 01:17:46,998
Where am I?

1720
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,127
Is that the Office Tower?

1721
01:17:57,675 --> 01:17:58,634
Bricksburg!

1722
01:18:00,303 --> 01:18:01,304
What was that?

1723
01:18:03,848 --> 01:18:04,348
No, no, no.

1724
01:18:04,974 --> 01:18:05,558
No!

1725
01:18:08,019 --> 01:18:09,562
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!

1726
01:18:09,812 --> 01:18:12,106
- Pew!
- What in the world is that?

1727
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:16,360
It's adorable.

1728
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:20,531
Uh-oh.

1729
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:22,783
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no.

1730
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:24,385
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me.

1731
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:25,828
Do not eat me. Please.

1732
01:18:26,412 --> 01:18:27,747
Hi, Emmet.

1733
01:18:28,664 --> 01:18:29,957
Uh...

1734
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:31,626
Hi?

1735
01:18:34,712 --> 01:18:37,048
Is this The Man...?

1736
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,057
The Man Upstairs?

1737
01:18:53,731 --> 01:18:55,024
What happened?

1738
01:18:56,025 --> 01:18:58,402
No, no, no, this is a disaster.

1739
01:18:59,362 --> 01:19:02,031
Why...? Why...? What? What?

1740
01:19:02,281 --> 01:19:03,241
What?

1741
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:07,286
Why is the dragon on top
of the luxury condo development?

1742
01:19:07,787 --> 01:19:08,871
But I was just playing...

1743
01:19:09,372 --> 01:19:10,706
I know it's hard to understand...

1744
01:19:10,957 --> 01:19:13,084
...but this is Dad's stuff, okay?

1745
01:19:13,376 --> 01:19:15,628
All of this that you see before you...

1746
01:19:15,878 --> 01:19:17,630
...is all your father's.

1747
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,757
And everything is thought-out very...

1748
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:21,525
What did you do down here?

1749
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:23,070
Did you take the top off of the tower?

1750
01:19:23,552 --> 01:19:24,887
It was an accident.

1751
01:19:25,137 --> 01:19:27,515
You accidentally...

1752
01:19:27,765 --> 01:19:29,183
...expertly...

1753
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:32,270
...carefully took the entire top
off of that tower?

1754
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:33,729
Yes.

1755
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,648
You know the rules. This isn't a toy.

1756
01:19:36,023 --> 01:19:38,609
- Um, well, it kind of is.
- No.

1757
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:42,363
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.

1758
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:44,865
- But we bought it at the toy store.
- We did.

1759
01:19:45,116 --> 01:19:48,119
But the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.

1760
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:50,371
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.

1761
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:54,625
That's a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.

1762
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:58,087
You can't expect me to be able
to resist playing with all this.

1763
01:19:58,337 --> 01:20:00,589
You have your stuff over near
the Christmas decorations.

1764
01:20:01,173 --> 01:20:03,259
All those bricks,
you can build anything you want.

1765
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:10,224
Finn, we're gonna play a little game.
It's called:

1766
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:13,269
"Let's Put Everything Back
the Way You Found It."

1767
01:20:13,519 --> 01:20:15,021
But, Dad, you don't understand.

1768
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:18,357
So I can make things
the way they're supposed to be.

1769
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:23,029
Permanently.

1770
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:27,366
More Kragles?

1771
01:20:27,616 --> 01:20:30,119
This rebellion ends right now.

1772
01:20:30,369 --> 01:20:31,746
Commencing...

1773
01:20:31,996 --> 01:20:33,164
...micro-management.

1774
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,337
Oh, no. No!

1775
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:46,010
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!

1776
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:51,390
Wait, what's happening?

1777
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,310
No, wait! No, we're going down! Mayday!

1778
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,936
No!

1779
01:20:57,355 --> 01:20:58,314
Meow. Meow.

1780
01:20:58,564 --> 01:21:00,399
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you!

1781
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:01,359
No!

1782
01:21:01,609 --> 01:21:02,234
Stop!

1783
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:03,694
Oh, no!

1784
01:21:13,287 --> 01:21:15,164
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers!

1785
01:21:15,414 --> 01:21:16,894
What am I holding here?

1786
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:19,794
- It's a battleship.
- No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.

1787
01:21:20,044 --> 01:21:21,253
What's Batman doing on it?

1788
01:21:22,088 --> 01:21:23,422
What is this, a robot pirate?

1789
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:25,174
Dang it.

1790
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:28,122
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!

1791
01:21:28,344 --> 01:21:30,346
You got glue all over
that construction worker.

1792
01:21:31,806 --> 01:21:33,808
Here. Give that to me.

1793
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,560
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1794
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:38,451
All of those are my friends! No, stop it!

1795
01:21:38,604 --> 01:21:41,690
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...

1796
01:21:42,525 --> 01:21:44,276
It be over.

1797
01:21:44,527 --> 01:21:46,362
No!

1798
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:50,533
The Piece of Resistance!

1799
01:21:50,783 --> 01:21:52,284
I can still save them!

1800
01:21:52,535 --> 01:21:55,955
Let's get this gunk
off this construction worker.

1801
01:21:56,205 --> 01:21:58,499
He's not just a construction worker, Dad.
He's the hero.

1802
01:21:58,749 --> 01:22:00,418
Nope, he's not.

1803
01:22:00,668 --> 01:22:03,254
He is a ordinary, regular...

1804
01:22:03,504 --> 01:22:05,089
...generic construction worker...

1805
01:22:05,339 --> 01:22:08,050
...and I need to put him back
where he belongs.

1806
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:12,179
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?

1807
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:17,643
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.

1808
01:22:18,394 --> 01:22:21,522
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature. .

1809
01:22:22,273 --> 01:22:23,357
I gotta move.

1810
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:25,734
Where is that?

1811
01:22:25,985 --> 01:22:27,778
Move!

1812
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,413
All right.

1813
01:22:59,435 --> 01:23:00,019
Move!

1814
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:06,942
Now, I didn't move...

1815
01:23:11,197 --> 01:23:11,780
Ow.

1816
01:23:14,575 --> 01:23:15,868
- Uh, Dad?
- Yeah.

1817
01:23:16,118 --> 01:23:19,079
I think I saw the X-Acto over there
near Middle Zealand.

1818
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:20,664
Oh, great. Thank you.

1819
01:23:20,915 --> 01:23:22,082
Welcome.

1820
01:23:29,924 --> 01:23:31,509
It's up to you now, Emmet.

1821
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:42,728
Believe.

1822
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,398
I know that sounds like a cat poster...

1823
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:48,234
...but it's true.

1824
01:23:55,366 --> 01:23:57,493
Whoa!

1825
01:24:10,297 --> 01:24:11,298
Sorry, street.

1826
01:24:17,221 --> 01:24:18,514
Ho-ho!

1827
01:24:23,644 --> 01:24:26,397
I can see everything.

1828
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:30,609
Ha, ha!

1829
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,319
What the heck is this?

1830
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,613
I am a MasterBuilder.

1831
01:24:37,324 --> 01:24:40,035
Release every Micro-manager we have!

1832
01:24:40,286 --> 01:24:41,870
Let's get him, fellas!

1833
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:47,042
Hey, everyone!

1834
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:49,169
- Emmet!
- Emmet! Yay!

1835
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,717
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.

1836
01:24:55,259 --> 01:24:56,218
You've got it, Emmet.

1837
01:24:56,468 --> 01:24:59,013
Take that! Ha, ha!

1838
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:00,431
Good night! Come here!

1839
01:25:00,681 --> 01:25:02,308
We'll help you out, kid.

1840
01:25:02,558 --> 01:25:05,060
Here's how we do it pirate-style!

1841
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:08,651
Yes! Emmet! That's it!

1842
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,735
Take him down, boys!

1843
01:25:16,655 --> 01:25:17,656
Emmet!

1844
01:25:20,242 --> 01:25:21,869
Stay positive.

1845
01:25:22,995 --> 01:25:24,163
They're tearing me apart!

1846
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:26,790
Stay positive.

1847
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:27,916
Come on!

1848
01:25:28,334 --> 01:25:29,752
Oh, forget it!

1849
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:37,968
You all need to be more friendly!

1850
01:25:40,596 --> 01:25:41,597
Emmet, go!

1851
01:25:41,847 --> 01:25:42,931
Go! Now's your...

1852
01:25:43,182 --> 01:25:44,582
- ...chance!
- She's right!

1853
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:47,645
- You can do it, me laddie!
- Go on, kid. Get in there!

1854
01:25:55,319 --> 01:25:56,319
Sir, we got an intrud...!

1855
01:25:58,238 --> 01:25:59,365
Lord Business.

1856
01:25:59,615 --> 01:26:01,283
Back from the dead, Brickowski?

1857
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:02,660
Well, you're too late!

1858
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:04,286
Skeletrons, get him!

1859
01:26:15,255 --> 01:26:16,799
Argh! I can't move!

1860
01:26:17,925 --> 01:26:19,093
You see, your friends...

1861
01:26:19,343 --> 01:26:20,303
...oh, they're finished!

1862
01:26:21,512 --> 01:26:22,721
My world is almost finished.

1863
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:26,934
The last thing I need to do is finish...

1864
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:28,644
- ...you.
- No, stop! Please!

1865
01:26:28,894 --> 01:26:31,522
If you do one more thing,
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.

1866
01:26:32,189 --> 01:26:33,399
Your secret weapon?

1867
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:36,527
Yes, it's called:

1868
01:26:36,777 --> 01:26:38,779
The Power of The Special.

1869
01:26:39,029 --> 01:26:40,280
That sounds dumb.

1870
01:26:41,073 --> 01:26:44,451
All right, here it comes.
My secret weapon...

1871
01:26:45,411 --> 01:26:46,745
...is this.

1872
01:26:48,038 --> 01:26:50,624
What is that? Is it super small?
I don't see anything.

1873
01:26:50,874 --> 01:26:53,043
It's my hand. I want you to take it.

1874
01:26:53,293 --> 01:26:54,670
You want me to take your hand off?

1875
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,589
No, I want you to join me.

1876
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:01,135
Look at all of these things that people built.

1877
01:27:01,427 --> 01:27:02,720
You might see a mess...

1878
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:05,597
Exactly. And a bunch
of weird, dorky stuff...

1879
01:27:05,848 --> 01:27:08,100
...that ruined my perfectly good stuff!

1880
01:27:09,059 --> 01:27:10,936
Okay. What I see...

1881
01:27:11,437 --> 01:27:14,606
...are people inspired by each other...

1882
01:27:15,149 --> 01:27:16,567
...and by you.

1883
01:27:17,693 --> 01:27:20,237
People taking what you made...

1884
01:27:20,779 --> 01:27:23,031
...and making something new out of it.

1885
01:27:39,506 --> 01:27:41,216
Finn, did you make all of this?

1886
01:27:44,011 --> 01:27:46,597
The people are trying to stop
President Business...

1887
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:48,724
...from using the Kragle.

1888
01:27:49,558 --> 01:27:50,893
What's the Kragle?

1889
01:27:51,602 --> 01:27:54,354
Um, it's in there.

1890
01:27:56,523 --> 01:27:58,025
In here?

1891
01:28:35,979 --> 01:28:39,775
So President Business is the bad guy?

1892
01:28:47,741 --> 01:28:48,992
If...

1893
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:52,955
If the construction guy...

1894
01:28:54,122 --> 01:28:55,762
...said something
to President Business...

1895
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:01,463
...what would he say?

1896
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,429
You...

1897
01:29:10,722 --> 01:29:13,100
...don't have to be...

1898
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:15,352
...the bad guy.

1899
01:29:17,896 --> 01:29:18,564
You...

1900
01:29:19,356 --> 01:29:21,108
...are the most talented...

1901
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,485
...most interesting...

1902
01:29:24,903 --> 01:29:28,198
...and most extraordinary person
in the universe.

1903
01:29:29,825 --> 01:29:32,995
And you are capable of amazing things...

1904
01:29:33,745 --> 01:29:37,499
...because you are The Special.

1905
01:29:40,878 --> 01:29:42,212
And so am I.

1906
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:46,884
And so is everyone.

1907
01:29:48,343 --> 01:29:50,387
The prophecy is made-up...

1908
01:29:51,221 --> 01:29:53,056
...but it's also true.

1909
01:29:53,724 --> 01:29:54,975
It's about all of us.

1910
01:29:55,684 --> 01:29:58,061
Right now, it's about you.

1911
01:29:59,396 --> 01:30:00,731
And you...

1912
01:30:01,857 --> 01:30:03,317
...Still...

1913
01:30:04,067 --> 01:30:06,236
...can change everything.

1914
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:33,347
Oh, we got a hugger.

1915
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:36,975
Be careful.

1916
01:30:37,225 --> 01:30:40,604
I have been told it might explode.

1917
01:30:51,615 --> 01:30:52,699
Phew.

1918
01:30:53,742 --> 01:30:56,078
Emmet, thank you.

1919
01:30:56,328 --> 01:30:58,789
And I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...

1920
01:30:59,247 --> 01:31:00,791
...from this moment forward...

1921
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:03,377
...I solemnly promise that I will never...

1922
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,429
Emmet!

1923
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,974
Hey, everyone! Is everyone okay?

1924
01:31:17,766 --> 01:31:18,767
Where's Lucy?

1925
01:31:19,309 --> 01:31:20,060
Emmet!

1926
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:21,728
Lucy!

1927
01:31:24,898 --> 01:31:26,191
We did it.

1928
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,491
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait.

1929
01:31:35,075 --> 01:31:37,744
Batman, there's something
I need to say to you.

1930
01:31:37,995 --> 01:31:39,579
No. Wyldstyle...

1931
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:41,039
I mean...

1932
01:31:41,748 --> 01:31:43,125
...Lucy.

1933
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:46,378
He's the hero you deserve.

1934
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:51,550
- Uh...
- Thanks, Batman.

1935
01:32:03,103 --> 01:32:05,772
I liked Emmet before it was cool.

1936
01:32:06,606 --> 01:32:08,650
Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle.

1937
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,360
How did that happen?

1938
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:12,029
Yay!

1939
01:32:12,279 --> 01:32:13,447
- De-Kragler.
- Watch this.

1940
01:32:13,697 --> 01:32:14,823
- Yay!
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy.

1941
01:32:15,073 --> 01:32:15,991
You're okay!

1942
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:17,826
- Oh, son!
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1943
01:32:19,327 --> 01:32:21,079
We're okay, son. Ha, ha.

1944
01:32:21,329 --> 01:32:23,970
Guys, time to come up for dinner.
It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite.

1945
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:27,335
- Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec.
- Yeah, we'll be up in a sec!

1946
01:32:27,836 --> 01:32:29,504
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

1947
01:32:29,755 --> 01:32:31,815
Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play...

1948
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,508
...guess who else gets to
come down here and play?

1949
01:32:33,759 --> 01:32:35,135
- Who?
- Your sister.

1950
01:32:35,385 --> 01:32:36,136
What?

1951
01:32:36,386 --> 01:32:38,466
Well, things sure have a way
of working out smoothly.

1952
01:32:38,597 --> 01:32:39,306
Am I right, guys?

1953
01:32:39,556 --> 01:32:41,308
What?

1954
01:32:46,605 --> 01:32:49,024
We're from the Planet Duplon.

1955
01:32:49,274 --> 01:32:52,486
We are here to destroy you.

1956
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:55,614
Oh, man.

1957
01:37:56,247 --> 01:37:58,541
Yes, this is real music.

1958
01:37:59,709 --> 01:38:01,336
Dark, brooding...

1959
01:38:01,795 --> 01:38:03,421
...important. ..

1960
01:38:03,671 --> 01:38:05,006
...groundbreaking.

1961
01:38:06,633 --> 01:38:07,675
Check out the lyrics.

1962
01:38:10,345 --> 01:38:11,763
Darkness

1963
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,433
No parents

1964
01:38:18,144 --> 01:38:19,938
Continued darkness

1965
01:38:20,188 --> 01:38:21,940
More darkness. Get it?

1966
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:24,067
The opposite of light

1967
01:38:24,776 --> 01:38:26,194
Black hole

1968
01:38:26,986 --> 01:38:28,196
Curtains drawn

1969
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:31,366
In the basement

1970
01:38:32,492 --> 01:38:34,077
Middle of the night

1971
01:38:35,453 --> 01:38:37,455
Blacked-out windows

1972
01:38:39,124 --> 01:38:40,542
Other places that are dark

1973
01:38:42,794 --> 01:38:44,003
Black suit

1974
01:38:45,213 --> 01:38:46,714
Black coffee

1975
01:38:47,465 --> 01:38:49,634
You get it. That's just the first verse.

1976
01:38:49,884 --> 01:38:51,719
Darkness

1977
01:38:53,012 --> 01:38:54,889
No parents

1978
01:38:56,141 --> 01:38:57,392
Super rich

1979
01:38:58,935 --> 01:39:00,603
Kind of makes it better
