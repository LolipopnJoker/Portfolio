1
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,965
Excuse me. Could you tell me
how to get to the medical school?

2
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,802
I'm supposed to be doing a lecture
in 20 minutes, and my driver's a bit lost.

3
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:58,309
You go straight ahead
and you make a left over the bridge.

4
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,313
That's a lovely accent you have.

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,231
New Jersey?

6
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,649
Austria.

7
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,526
Austria?

8
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,153
Well, then...

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,155
...good day, mate.

10
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,618
Let's put another shrimp on the barbie.

11
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:18,329
Let's not.

12
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,248
Who's got the Wiener Schnitzel?

13
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,917
Beautiful. There you go, Dolf.

14
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,336
There you go, buddy. Yeah, enjoy.

15
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:54,842
Let's see, next we got
roast beef Au jus.

16
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,219
Who's got the roast beef Au jus?

17
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,430
Stella, beautiful. Bon appétit, Stella.

18
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,309
Yeah, walk away. Go on, go on.

19
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,270
Last but not least, footlong.

20
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:09,231
Who's got the footlong?

21
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,901
Very... Very funny, Rascal.

22
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,611
Very funny. In your dreams.

23
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,448
<i>Harry, why haven't you
dropped those dogs off at the show yet?</i>

24
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,660
Sir, I didn't want to send them
to a performance on an empty stomach, sir.

25
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,037
<i>Get a move on it.</i>

26
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,373
Yes, sir. Mutt Cutts. Ten-four.

27
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,146
Suck me sideways.

28
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,870
Hello. How are you?

29
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,000
Uh... Uh... Uh...

30
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,502
Yeah.

31
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,380
- I'll be out in one minute.
- Okay.

32
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,660
Why you going to the airport?

33
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,829
Flying somewhere?

34
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,165
- How'd you guess?
- Well, I saw your luggage.

35
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,544
Then when I noticed the airline ticket,
I put two and two together.

36
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,172
- So where you headed?
- Aspen.

37
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:01,176
Mm. California. Beautiful.

38
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,890
Name's Christmas, Lloyd Christmas.

39
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,226
I'm Maw Swanson.

40
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,229
This isn't my real job, you know.

41
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,564
- No?
- Nope.

42
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,359
My friend Harry and I are saving up
our money to open our own pet store.

43
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,569
That's nice.

44
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,363
I Got Worms.

45
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,783
- I beg your pardon?
- That's what we're gonna call it.

46
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,412
I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize
in selling worm farms.

47
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,581
You know, like ant farms?

48
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,251
What's the matter?

49
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,503
A little tense about the flight?

50
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,757
Something like that.

51
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,343
There's really nothing to worry about.

52
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,929
Statistically, you're more likely
to get killed on the way to the airport.

53
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,225
Like in a head-on crash or flying off a
cliff or getting trapped under a gas truck.

54
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,393
That's the worst.

55
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,208
I have this cousin... Well, I had
this cousin. He's like, pbbt.

56
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,192
Lloyd, could you keep your eyes
on the road, please?

57
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,486
Oh, yeah.

58
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,154
Good thinking.

59
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,655
Can't be too careful.

60
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,949
Lot of bad drivers out there.

61
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,625
Hey, watch it!

62
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,885
Okay, gang. You know the rules.

63
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,429
No humping, no pushing,
no sniffing heinies.

64
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,806
Where have you been?

65
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,475
My dogs were supposed to be here
40 minutes ago.

66
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,894
Now, I hardly have any time
to primp them.

67
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,355
Don't worry about a thing,
Mrs. Neugyburger.

68
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,440
- Neugeboren.
- Neu... Neu... Neu...

69
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,067
- Boren.
- Boren. These pooches...

70
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,654
...are not gonna need primping.
You know why? Because I bathed them...

71
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,280
...and I clipped them myself.

72
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,200
And I stand by my performance.

73
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,704
<i>Judging moved to 3 p.m., ring 1.</i>

74
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,172
On second thought, you might wanna
run a comb through them.

75
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,466
<i>The white zone is for...</i>

76
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,344
<i>...the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.</i>

77
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,096
<i>No parking.</i>

78
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,769
- Thanks. Here you go.
- Oh, no, Mary.

79
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,313
I couldn't possibly accept that.

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,691
Not after all we've been through.

81
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,113
Thank you, Lloyd.

82
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,158
- Good luck with your worms.
- Thanks.

83
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,701
Hey.

84
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,037
How about a hug?

85
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:39,126
<i>The white zone is for the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.</i>

86
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,836
<i>No parking.</i>

87
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,390
I hate goodbyes.

88
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,900
- Uh, Lloyd...
- Shh.

89
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,819
Just go.

90
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,135
Be strong.

91
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,694
<i>Mr. Dan Richard,
please pick up the white courtesy phone.</i>

92
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,741
<i>Mr. Dan Richard, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.</i>

93
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,744
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

94
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,540
- You make the pickup.
- Piece of cake.

95
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,466
<i>Goodbye, my love</i>

96
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,141
Bye.

97
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:23,564
<i>Passenger Warren Passion, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.</i>

98
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,107
<i>You have a message.</i>

99
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,276
<i>Passenger Warren Passion...</i>

100
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,409
Mary!

101
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,329
There's our payday.

102
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,750
- She left it. Let's go.
- Excuse me.

103
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,003
Coming through.

104
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,591
Move it or lose it, sister.

105
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,930
Hey!

106
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,522
Eeny, meeny, miney, Moe!

107
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,406
Hold that plane!

108
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,617
Sir, you can't go in there.

109
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,493
It's okay.

110
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,996
I'm a limo driver.

111
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,902
- Hi, Lloyd.
- Hi, Harry.

112
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,071
How was your day?

113
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,032
Not bad. Fell off the Jetway again.

114
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,917
Who the hell do you figure
this guy's working for, anyway?

115
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,877
I don't know...

116
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,215
...but we sure as hell better find out.

117
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,889
- The ulcer?
- I'll live.

118
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,025
- So you got fired again, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:36,321
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident, you know?

120
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,283
Yeah, well, I lost my job too.

121
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,956
Man, you are one pathetic loser.

122
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,043
- No offense.
- No. None taken.

123
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,467
You know what really
chaffs my ass, though?

124
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,138
I spent my life savings turning
my van into a dog.

125
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,973
Hi, Petey.

126
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,810
- The alarm alone cost me 200.
- Hey, chicks love it.

127
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,937
It's a shagging wagon.

128
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,149
What's with the briefcase?

129
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,320
It's a love memento.

130
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,323
The most beautiful woman alive.

131
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:25,871
I drove her to the airport, sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

132
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,831
She actually talked to me, man.

133
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,877
- Get out of here.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

134
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,044
Tractor beam.

135
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,006
Sucked me right in.

136
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,091
Anyway...

137
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,139
...she left this in the terminal
and flew to Aspen and out of my life.

138
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,516
What's in it?

139
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,896
Man, I would have to be a lowlife...

140
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,857
...to go rooting around
in somebody else's private property.

141
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,025
Is it locked?

142
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,360
Yeah, really well.

143
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,246
There's two of them.
One of them's got a gun.

144
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,167
Did you pay the gas bill?

145
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,713
- Hey...
- Do you realize what you've done?

146
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,716
I'm sorry. I say we bail.

147
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,635
Okay.

148
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,563
Briefcase ain't here.
He must have taken it with him.

149
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,149
Well, he's gotta come home sometime.

150
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,653
Maybe we should trash the place,
send him a little message.

151
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,323
I don't think he's gonna get
that message, Joe.

152
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,867
I mean, the guy's got worms
in his living room.

153
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,661
Yeah.

154
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,622
Oh, I got a better idea.

155
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,585
I thought I saw a pussy cat.

156
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,422
Oh, I did. I did. Come here.

157
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,942
I can't believe we drove around all day
and there's not a single job in this town.

158
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,027
There is nothing, nada, zip.

159
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,030
Yeah, unless you wanna work
40 hours a week.

160
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,408
- Pfft.
- Here.

161
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,076
I'm gonna go to the store.

162
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,329
Okay, just get the bare essentials.
That's the last of our dough.

163
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,874
Hey, what do I look like?

164
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,662
Cripes.

165
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,757
Excuse me, little old lady.

166
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,642
- Do you have change of a dollar?
- Change? No, I'm sorry, I don't.

167
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,813
Well, could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff here...

168
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,357
...while I go break a dollar?

169
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,485
- Of course.
- Thanks.

170
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,778
Hey.

171
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,112
I guess they're right.

172
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,950
Senior citizens, although slow
and dangerous behind the wheel...

173
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,577
...can still serve a purpose.

174
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,539
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me.

175
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,547
Where's the booze?

176
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,636
I got robbed by a sweet old lady
on a motorized cart.

177
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,180
I didn't even see it coming.

178
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,015
Oh.

179
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,684
- Harry.
- No.

180
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,519
- Harry.
- No.

181
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,062
Come on, Harry.

182
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,232
- Cheer up.
- It gets worse, Lloyd.

183
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,693
My parakeet, Petey?

184
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,069
Yeah?

185
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,946
He's dead.

186
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,077
Oh, man. I'm sorry, Harry.

187
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,204
What happened?

188
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,915
His head fell off.

189
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,001
His head fell off?

190
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,461
Yeah, he was pretty old.

191
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,757
Oh.

192
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,426
That's it.

193
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,970
I've had it with this dump!

194
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,181
We got no food, we got no jobs...

195
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,183
...our pets' heads are falling off!

196
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,771
- Okay, just calm down.
- What the hell are we doing here, Harry?

197
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,606
We gotta get out of this town.

198
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,276
Yeah, and go where?
Where are we gonna go?

199
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,778
I'll tell you where.

200
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,031
Someplace warm.

201
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,992
A place where the beer flows like wine.

202
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,787
Where beautiful women instinctively flock
like the salmon of Capistrano.

203
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,044
I'm talking about a little place
called Aspen.

204
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,630
I don't know, Lloyd.
The French are assholes.

205
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,467
Wait a minute.

206
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,637
Wait a minute.
I know what you're up to, mister.

207
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,976
Yeah, you just wanna go to Aspen and
find that girl who lost her briefcase...

208
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,271
...and you need me
to drive you there, right?

209
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:47,817
- Am I right? Am I right? Am I right, Lloyd?
- Yeah. So? Yeah. So?

210
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,278
So I wanna go someplace
where we know somebody...

211
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,447
...who can plug us
into the social pipeline.

212
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,991
No. No, no, no, Lloyd.

213
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,870
No. I say we stay here, we hunt for jobs
and we keep saving our money...

214
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,372
...for the worm store.

215
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,209
I don't know about you,
but I am getting sick and tired...

216
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,835
...of running from creditors.

217
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,839
You know what I'm sick and tired of,
Harry?

218
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,677
I'm sick and tired
of having to eke my way through life.

219
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,184
I'm sick and tired of being a nobody.

220
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,938
But most of all...

221
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,529
...I'm sick and tired of having nobody.

222
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:37,575
Okay, Lloyd.

223
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,330
Aspen it is.

224
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,711
You'd better not be fooling.

225
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,095
Okay, okay.

226
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,640
Just let it out. Have a good cry.
Come on.

227
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,059
Okay.

228
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,647
Okay, that's enough.

229
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,562
Lloyd, what are you doing?

230
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,481
It feels like you're running
at an incredible rate, Harry.

231
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,609
Quit it. We're not through Connecticut...

232
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,528
- ...and already you're annoying me.
- I'm sorry.

233
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,448
We're really doing it, though,
aren't we, buddy?

234
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,951
Hey, where did you get those?

235
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,287
I bought them when we filled up.

236
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,708
But wait, but you... We're supposed to talk
about all expenditures, Lloyd.

237
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,169
We are on a very tight budget.

238
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,463
This didn't come out of our travel fund.

239
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,800
No, I was able to raise
25 extra bucks before we left.

240
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,637
Where did you get 25 extra bucks?

241
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,224
I sold some stuff to Billy in 4C.

242
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,020
- The blind kid?
- Yeah.

243
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,563
Yeah.

244
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,815
What did you sell him, Lloyd?

245
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,985
Stuff.

246
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,154
What kind of stuff?

247
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,864
I don't know.

248
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,243
A few baseball cards,
a sack of marbles...

249
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,661
...Petey.

250
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,330
Petey?

251
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,667
You sold my dead bird to a blind kid?

252
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,170
Lloyd, the... That... You...
What are you...?

253
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,339
Petey didn't even have a head.

254
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,757
Harry...

255
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,051
...I took care of it.

256
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,138
Pretty bird.

257
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,182
Yeah, can you say "pretty bird"?

258
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,976
Pretty bird.

259
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,895
Yes, pretty bird.

260
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,981
Pretty bird.

261
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,860
Polly want a cracker?

262
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,451
Those rat bastards.
They're rubbing it right in our faces.

263
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,330
Man, Andre'll have a goddamn hemorrhage
if we don't get that briefcase back.

264
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,541
They must have been following us
for weeks.

265
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,167
Why you say?

266
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,044
"Gas Man."

267
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:38,089
How the hell do they know
that I got gas?

268
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,383
They gotta be pros.

269
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,343
Don't worry.

270
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,470
We're gonna get that money back.

271
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,557
And I'll tell you something else.

272
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,726
They ain't never getting to Aspen.

273
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,769
I'm gonna see to that.

274
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:01,279
They got the Monkees.
They were a major influence on the Beatles.

275
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,031
Yeah, I know.

276
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,410
Excuse me, Flo?

277
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,379
Flo, like the TV show.

278
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,717
What is the Soup Du Jour?

279
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,344
It's the soup of the day.

280
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:28,097
Mm. That sounds good. I'll have that.

281
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,851
Anything else before I leave the area?

282
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,103
No. Yep, yes.

283
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,565
Yes, my soda's flat.
It doesn't have any bubbles.

284
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,532
Happy now?

285
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,083
Feels good to mingle with these
laid-back country folk, don't it, Har?

286
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,378
I like it a lot.

287
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,172
Uh-oh.

288
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,965
What? What's the matter?

289
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,471
You spilled the salt.
That's what's the matter.

290
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,183
Spilling the salt is very bad luck.

291
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,937
We're driving across the country.
The last thing we need is bad luck.

292
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,232
Quick, toss some salt
over your right shoulder.

293
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,737
What the hell?

294
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,531
Uh-oh.

295
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,616
Too little too late, Harry.

296
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,455
Who's the dead man that hit me
with the salt shaker?

297
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,511
Well, oh, that...
It was a terrible mistake, sir.

298
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,181
Please, believe me. I would never do
anything to offend a man of your size.

299
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,267
Kick his ass, Sea Bass.

300
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,105
- Go ahead, Sea Bass.
- You gonna eat that?

301
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,524
What, that? No. Yes. No.

302
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:05,027
Well, no. It crossed my mind. Yeah.

303
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,793
Still want it?

304
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,880
No, you go ahead.

305
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,305
You really wimped out, man.

306
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,390
What are you talking about,
"wimped out"?

307
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,225
What, what, did you s...?

308
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,353
- The guy hooked on my burger. What...?
- No, no, wait a second.

309
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,647
I think I just...

310
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,232
Yeah.

311
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,567
I just had an idea.

312
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,073
Follow me.

313
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,124
Excuse me, guys.

314
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,876
What the hell do you want?

315
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,841
I just want to apologize
for that unpleasant scene a little earlier.

316
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,553
My friend Harry and I would...

317
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,805
...like to buy you guys...

318
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,682
...a round of beers...

319
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,559
...just to bury the hatchet.

320
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,937
Make it four boilermakers.

321
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,772
Whatever you want, sir.

322
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,650
I'll have the waitress bring it over
immediately.

323
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,779
- Lloyd, what are you doing?
- Shh.

324
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,281
- We can't afford to buy them drinks.
- Shh.

325
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,953
Excuse me.

326
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,123
Sea Bass and the fellas
offered to pick up our check.

327
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,043
They said just put it on their tab.

328
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,879
They're very nice.

329
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,298
Sea Bass said that?

330
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:54,303
Well, if that guy at the table over there
is Sea Bass...

331
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,647
All right, if that's what he wants.

332
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,610
- Put these on there too, okay?
- You got it.

333
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:18,494
- Son of a...!
- I'm gonna kill those sons of bitches!

334
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,127
That was genius, Lloyd. Sheer genius.

335
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,504
Where did you come up
with a scam like that?

336
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,256
Saw it in a movie once.

337
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,758
That was incredible.

338
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,969
What happened?
Guy tricks some sucker...

339
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,471
...into picking up his tab
and gets away Scot-free?

340
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,140
No. In the movie...

341
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:43,060
...they catch up to him half mile
down the road and slit his throat.

342
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,478
It was a good one.

343
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,025
Wow. Mm.

344
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,028
- Harry?
- What?

345
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,698
I know this isn't the best time,
but when you get a chance to pull over...

346
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,283
- Yeah?
- ...I gotta pee.

347
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,827
What, are you crazy?
I'm not pulling over now.

348
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:03,164
- But I gotta go. What am I supposed to do?
- Well...

349
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:07,960
Whiz in one of the empty beer bottles.
They're on the floor, just get one of...

350
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,212
Quit playing around.

351
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,256
What...? What...?

352
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,508
Shit.

353
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,387
- Watch the seat.
- Okay.

354
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,598
- Watch the seat.
- All right.

355
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,311
Ah.

356
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:31,942
Uh-oh.

357
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,194
What? What's wrong?

358
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,322
The bottle's almost full
and I'm still going.

359
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,990
- So stop going.
- I'm still...

360
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:41,202
I can't stop going once I've started.
It stings.

361
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,079
- Quick, get me another bottle.
- What?

362
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,916
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on, come on.

363
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,918
- Here, here, here. Go.
- Okay.

364
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,590
Hold that.

365
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,599
Hold that one.

366
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,768
Hurry, I'm pitching it.

367
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,270
What are you, a camel?

368
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,277
Pull over.

369
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,492
- Huh?
- Pull over.

370
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,787
No, it's a cardigan,
but thanks for noticing.

371
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,372
Yeah.

372
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,957
Killer boots, man.

373
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:32,211
Pull your vehicle
to the side of the road.

374
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,347
License and registration, please.

375
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,104
You fellas were going a little fast
back there, wouldn't you say?

376
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,315
You...

377
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,860
You fellas been doing a bit of boozing,
have you?

378
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:58,571
Sucking back on grandpa's
old cough medicine?

379
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,323
- No. Oh, no, sir. No.
- No, no, no.

380
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,993
Yeah, well, what's that?

381
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,414
- That's nothing, sir.
- Yeah, nothing.

382
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,667
Well, are you aware
that it's against the law...

383
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,171
...to have an open alcohol container here
in the state of Pennsylvania?

384
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,674
Come on. Give me that booze,
you little pumpkin-pie-haircutted freak.

385
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,176
Come on.

386
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,312
- Sir, no, I...
- No, sir. Don't. Don't drink...

387
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:35,691
You'd keep your mouth shut
if you knew what was good for you, buddy.

388
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,584
Tic Tac, sir?

389
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,127
Get the hell out of here.

390
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,886
How could they
not have gotten the ransom?

391
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,763
It just doesn't make sense.

392
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,724
I left the money exactly
where they instructed me to.

393
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,726
Oh, it makes perfect sense, Mary.

394
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,438
We should have called the authorities
the minute we knew Bobby was kidnapped.

395
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:18,776
- Helen, we've been through this already.
- Mr. Andre.

396
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,694
- Nicholas.
- Karl.

397
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,072
- Nick, Nick, Nick.
- Nick.

398
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,490
Any word yet, sir?

399
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,243
No. Nothing yet, Nicholas.

400
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:31,080
I've been giving this a lot of thought.

401
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,043
Maybe we should cancel the preservation
benefit. It'll be so easy to re-schedule.

402
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,754
I don't think we should do anything
out of the ordinary.

403
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,965
It's imperative that we carry on as usual.

404
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,676
- Okay.
- Especially you, Mary.

405
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,929
What am I supposed to do?
Go about my life like everything is fine?

406
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,140
- That's exactly what you should do.
- Yes. Go skiing. Go to parties.

407
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,434
- Act normally, you know.
- Yeah, don't you see?

408
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,353
We can't let on that anything's wrong.

409
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,774
If the press or the authorities
get wind of this, the kidnappers may panic.

410
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,029
I mean, you never know
what they might do to him then.

411
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,339
So he said, "Do you love me?"
And she says, "No..."

412
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,133
"...but that's a real nice ski mask."

413
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,099
Hey, man. What's that?

414
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,175
You want me to drive?

415
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,053
No, I'm cool.

416
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,378
Yes.

417
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,755
- Yeah.
- You gonna get it.

418
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,716
Get her.

419
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,677
Oh, yeah, bitch.

420
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,018
This is the life.

421
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:30,105
Cold beer, a hot tub
and paper-thin walls.

422
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,943
There's only one thing
that could make this moment any better.

423
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,612
What's that?

424
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,614
If you had a nice set of knockers.

425
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,366
That's two things, Lloyd.

426
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,203
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
you're not stacked, Harry...

427
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,830
...or I'll be banging you right now.

428
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,500
I'd show you what a real man can do.

429
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,879
Split you like an old piece of firewood.

430
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,593
You'd probably like it too,
you big homo.

431
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,303
Shut up.

432
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,264
Don't tell me to shut up, woman.

433
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,982
Yes.

434
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,944
I don't know, Lloyd,
this place doesn't really do it for me.

435
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,821
It brings back a lot of memories.

436
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,952
It was a few years ago.

437
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,079
What happened, Harry?

438
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,249
- Some little filly break your heart?
- No, it was a girl.

439
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,334
Fraida Felcher.

440
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:36,797
We stayed in a place just like this.
Wasn't this classy, but you know, nice.

441
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,674
Felcher?

442
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,217
From Cranston?

443
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,551
Yeah, you know her?

444
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,429
Oh, yeah.

445
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,598
I mean, I remember you...

446
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,975
...talking about her.

447
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,187
We had the most incredibly
romantic time.

448
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:55,107
I thought we were gonna be together
forever, and then...

449
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:58,527
About a week later, out of the blue
she sends me a John Deere letter.

450
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,239
- She give you any reason?
- Yeah, I called her up.

451
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,617
She gave me crap about me
not listening to her enough or something.

452
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,871
I don't know, I wasn't paying attention.
But the thing that hurt the most...

453
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,207
...is I think she was seeing another guy.

454
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,255
Never did find out who.

455
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:46,033
Mr. Andre, guess who
we just happened upon. Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,494
I had plans. I had things I wanted to do.

457
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,496
This is where it ends,
in a phone booth.

458
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,751
Yeah, the boys are holed up
in a little love nest for the night.

459
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,086
I think they're a little bit strange.

460
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,006
What the hell are these guys up to?
I mean...

461
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,091
...is it possible they could be feds?

462
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,386
Highly unlikely from what I've seen.

463
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:12,100
Sir, did you ever hear
of the concept of other people?

464
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:16,772
Me, being that, for the phone, sir...

465
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,649
You turned your back on me.
Ooh, ooh!

466
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,360
He got me mad. I almost like it.

467
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,321
You were supposed
to grab that bag so we could end this shit.

468
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:25,614
Here's your drink, baby.

469
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,242
- What I would...
- The damage I can do to you.

470
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:32,537
- Hold on a minute.
- Because you were spiteful. I didn't wanna...

471
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,919
That's not your problem.
You didn't know.

472
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,129
Get off the phone.

473
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,300
Get off the pho...

474
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,140
I'm sorry, Mr. Andre,
you were saying?

475
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,978
Look, Mental, these jokers have got
a lot of money and it belongs to me.

476
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,648
I wanna know who they are.
What they're doing with it.

477
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,024
Hey, hey, hey.

478
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,111
I told you already I'm on it. All right?

479
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,114
Good.

480
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,538
According to the map,
we've only gone about four inches.

481
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,998
You know,
I don't think we have enough gas money.

482
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,501
Relax. We have more than enough.

483
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,503
I think you're wrong, Lloyd.

484
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,588
How much you wanna bet?

485
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,173
I don't bet.

486
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,509
- What do you mean you don't bet?
- I don't bet.

487
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,219
- I don't gamble.
- Pussy, pussy.

488
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,555
- I never have and I never will.
- Pussy.

489
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,682
Yeah, right.

490
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:36,518
I bet I can get you gambling
before the end of the day.

491
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:37,727
No way.

492
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,354
- I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
- No.

493
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,730
- 5-to-1.
- No.

494
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,357
10-to-1?

495
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,067
You're on.

496
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,030
- I'm gonna get you.
- Uh-uh.

497
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,574
Oh, yeah.

498
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,868
I don't know how,
but I'm gonna get you.

499
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,871
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

500
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:59,916
Come on, Joe. Let me do them.
Let me do both of them.

501
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,378
- You don't have to worry about it.
- Just shut up.

502
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,714
Now, we don't even know
who the hell they are.

503
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,633
You don't kill people you don't know.
That's a rule.

504
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,511
I want you to get up here,
lie down on the front seat.

505
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,054
When they pick me up...

506
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,390
...you follow us. You got that?

507
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,518
Keep your shirt on.
I gotta squeeze a lemon.

508
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,402
Hey, hey, hey. Here they come.

509
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,821
Stay down. Stay down.

510
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,502
Say, are you guys going
to Davenport?

511
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,339
My car died
and I'm late for a luncheon.

512
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,927
We usually don't pick up hitchhikers...

513
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:56,264
...but I'm gonna go with my instinct
on this one.

514
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,433
Saddle up, partner.

515
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,187
You're it.

516
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,855
- You're it.
- You're it, quitsies.

517
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,441
You're it. Quitsies.
No anti-quitsies. No startsies.

518
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,859
- You can't do that.
- Can to.

519
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,779
- Can't. Stamped it.
- Can too. Double stamped it. No erasies.

520
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,949
Cannot. Triple stamped it. No erasies.
Touch blue, make it true.

521
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,660
You can't triple stamp
a double stamp, Lloyd.

522
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,663
You can't triple stamp a double stamp.
You... Lloyd. Lloyd.

523
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,749
Guys! Enough!

524
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,837
Hey.

525
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,924
Wanna hear the most annoying sound
in the world?

526
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:37,305
Guys! Guys! Guys!

527
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,392
Fellas...

528
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,563
...you think we could listen to the radio
or something?

529
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,983
Radio?

530
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,819
Who needs a radio? Ready, Harry?

531
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:54,489
- Mock
- Yeah

532
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,449
- Ing
- Yeah

533
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,368
- Bird
- Yeah

534
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,328
- Yeah
- Yeah

535
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:05,500
- Mockingbird, everybody have you heard?
- Mockingbird, everybody have you heard?

536
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:09,796
- She's gonna buy me a mockingbird
- She's gonna buy me a mockingbird

537
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:13,466
- And if that mockingbird don't sing
- And if that mockingbird don't sing

538
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:17,762
- She's gonna buy me a diamond ring
- She's gonna buy me a diamond ring

539
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,724
- And if that diamond ring don't shine
- And if that diamond...

540
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,976
Lloyd, there's people
who want a ride too.

541
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,020
Pick them up.

542
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,402
- Mock
- Si

543
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,195
- Ing
- Si

544
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,239
- Bird
- Si

545
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:38,491
- Si
- Si

546
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,835
You want an Atomic Pepper,
Mr. Mentalino?

547
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:51,796
No.

548
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,840
You guys go ahead.

549
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,717
I'll do it if you Will, Lloyd.

550
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,719
Okay. You go first.

551
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:59,179
No. Uh-uh. No. You go first.

552
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,890
- No, you go first. No, you go first.
- No, you go first.

553
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,808
- You go. I always go first.
- Oh, yeah.

554
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:08,521
Why don't you guys both stop acting
like a couple of pussies...

555
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,149
...and go at the same time, huh?

556
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,737
- That sounds like a dare, Harry.
- It's a double dare.

557
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:18,198
Yeah, okay. You're on.

558
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,583
- It's not so bad.
- Well?

559
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,503
- It's more tingly than hot.
- Yeah.

560
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:47,936
Now, if you fellas would excuse me,
I gotta use the phone.

561
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,730
Enjoy your meal, guys.

562
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:56,611
Here, Lloyd. This helps. Here.

563
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,863
It works good.

564
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,205
Yeah, it's Mental.

565
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,417
I'm just sitting down
to a nice meal with our boys.

566
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,795
How nice for you. Don't forget
that your bread plate is on the left.

567
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,715
<i>Look, I can't have these guys
running around Aspen.</i>

568
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,801
Don't worry. They ain't gonna be running
around nowhere...

569
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:23,346
...after I dump a little rat poison
in their Shirley Temple.

570
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,811
Good, good.

571
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:33,022
- That's good.
- Here he comes. Here he comes.

572
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:39,112
- Feeling better, girls?
- Yes, much better. Thank you for asking.

573
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,746
So why you going to Aspen? Vacation?

574
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,332
Why don't you eat up and we'll tell you.

575
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,253
It just doesn't seem
like you packed much.

576
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,173
All I saw was one bag and a briefcase.

577
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:02,427
No, no, the briefcase isn't even ours.
Some lady left it at the airport.

578
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:05,680
We're just bringing it back to her.
How's your burger?

579
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,518
You mean you don't even know her?

580
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:24,616
Talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

581
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,648
Are you okay, man? It was just a goof.

582
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,358
My ulcer.

583
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:01,402
Quick, quick, my pills.

584
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,404
Somebody should call an ambulance.

585
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,783
Look, you get the pills.
Don't worry, I know CPR.

586
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,245
- I'll get the pills.
- Out with the bad air, in with the good.

587
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,413
Out with the bad air...

588
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,423
No.

589
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,136
This is a lot easier if you just lay back.

590
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,930
Here, here.

591
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,765
- Here.
- He's resisting me.

592
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,685
Here. Here you go. Here you go.
Here you go.

593
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,687
- Pills. Okay.
- Here you go. There you go.

594
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:39,732
- Pills are good. Pills are good.
- Drink them down. Drink them down.

595
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:43,152
- There you go. There you go, big guy.
- That's better.

596
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,613
You want some ketchup
and mustard? That helped us.

597
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,448
Yeah.

598
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,452
You son of a...

599
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,121
...bitch!

600
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,133
Check, please.

601
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,638
I can't believe it.

602
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,641
Life's a fragile thing, Har.

603
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:17,478
One minute you're chewing on a burger,
the next minute you're dead meat.

604
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,564
But he blamed me.

605
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:21,816
You heard him.
Those were his last words.

606
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:25,403
Not if you count the gurgling sound.

607
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,284
You mean he was poisoned?

608
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:32,785
No doubt about it.

609
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,538
They found these next to the body.

610
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:37,832
- Sir.
- Yeah?

611
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,835
Waitress says he came in
with a couple of younger guys.

612
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,838
They called the ambulance
and then they hit the road.

613
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,507
- Any idea where they were going?
- We received a report.

614
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,594
They were seen headed west
on I-80 towards Colorado.

615
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,347
Did you get a make on the vehicle?

616
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,933
Yes, sir.

617
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,186
They're driving an '84...

618
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,646
Sheepdog.

619
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,414
Skis, huh?

620
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,166
- That's right.
- Great.

621
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,919
They yours?

622
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:07,922
Uh-huh.

623
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,843
Both of them?

624
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,596
Yeah.

625
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,100
Cool.

626
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:26,607
Excuse me, but you...
You're spraying everywhere.

627
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,997
Oh, man, you gotta be shitting me.

628
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,832
If it ain't my old friend.

629
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:31,089
You're right on time.

630
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,308
That's a lot of luggage
for a little vacation.

631
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:43,935
Oh, I'm moving to Aspen.

632
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:47,355
I've gotta get away from my boyfriend.
He's such a klutz.

633
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:51,526
Plus my astrologer told me that I really
should stay away from accident-prone guys.

634
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,570
Well, you know, I...

635
00:51:57,532 --> 00:52:00,535
Here, it's a little loose.
You might wanna...

636
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,578
- Thank you.
- No, hey, no. Allow me.

637
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:07,959
I've got a thing of thing...
Here, got them right here. Right here.

638
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,633
Thank you.

639
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,011
Sure. You know, I'm heading up
to Aspen myself.

640
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:23,391
Maybe we could, you know, meet up,
have some hot chocolate or something.

641
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,184
Sure, why not.

642
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,394
You seem harmless.

643
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,479
I'm gonna give you my number.

644
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,189
- Let me find a pen though.
- Great.

645
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:33,276
Let's see.
I know I have one in here somewhere.

646
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,070
Look, just tell it to me.
I got a really good memory.

647
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,239
- Well, the number's 555...
- 555.

648
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,409
...905...
Wait a minute, that's my old number.

649
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,744
That is so weird
how your mind goes blank...

650
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,581
For God's sakes
just give me the damn number!

651
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,585
Okay, look, you're gonna get pushy,
forget about it.

652
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,885
Find a happy place.

653
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,888
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place.

654
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:04,432
I'll show you a happy place.

655
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:07,768
Here's your happy place.

656
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:55,066
Go around now. Go around.

657
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,947
- All right. Any sign of them?
- No, but we're expecting them shortly.

658
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,991
A motorist saw a pooch
about 30 miles back headed this way.

659
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:12,041
Look, I told you what happened,
so just drop it.

660
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:14,460
Yeah, okay. Sure thing, Lloyd.
Sure thing.

661
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:18,422
I promise not to mention another word...

662
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:22,468
...about being in a bathroom
with a 6'4" trucker with his pants down.

663
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,188
Hey, look, we're almost in Colorado.

664
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:38,526
What do you say we change seats?
I've been driving for nine straight hours.

665
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,696
I don't have the energy
to start a new state.

666
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,825
- Why should I do you any favors?
- I'll let you kiss me.

667
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:50,121
I swear I'm gonna...

668
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:53,207
Take your... I'm gonna...
Swear to God I'm gonna take...

669
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:57,378
- Oh, don't...
- Don't touch me.

670
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:05,803
I'm done, okay. Enough.

671
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:22,403
Hey, guys. Oh, Big Gulps, huh?
All right.

672
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,780
Well, see you later.

673
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:31,078
Hey, Harry, I got some beef jerk...

674
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:38,961
Some people just weren't cut out
for life on the road.

675
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:14,288
Hey.

676
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:17,541
I was wondering
when you were gonna get up.

677
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,296
Well, how long have I been out?

678
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:26,634
I'd say a good five hours.

679
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:36,644
Huh. I expected the Rocky Mountains
to be a little rockier than this.

680
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,980
I was thinking the same thing.

681
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:43,692
That John Denver is full of shit, man.

682
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,323
I'm only human, Harry.

683
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,660
Anybody can make a mistake.

684
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,537
Come on.

685
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,539
Stop being a baby.

686
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,666
So we backtracked a tad.

687
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,584
A tad?

688
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,962
A tad, Lloyd?

689
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:10,010
You drove almost a sixth of the way
across the country in the wrong direction!

690
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,180
Now we don't have enough money
to get to Aspen.

691
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,767
We don't have enough money to get home!
We don't have enough money to eat!

692
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,062
We don't have enough money to sleep!

693
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,026
Well, it's not gonna do us any good
to sit here whining about it.

694
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,903
We're in a hole.

695
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,198
We're just gonna have
to dig ourselves out.

696
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,076
Okay. Right. You're right.

697
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:35,870
You're absolutely right, Lloyd.

698
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,872
Where you going?

699
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,667
Home. I'm walking home.

700
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:46,589
Oh, well, pardon me, Mr. Perfect!

701
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:50,718
I guess I forgot that you never,
ever make a mistake.

702
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,119
Harry!

703
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,163
Harry!

704
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,665
Hey!

705
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,709
Harry. Wait up.

706
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:41,435
Got room for one more
if you still wanna go to Aspen.

707
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,687
Where did you find that?

708
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:47,066
Some kid back in town.

709
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,485
Traded the van for it, straight up.

710
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:52,905
I can get 70 miles to the gallon
on this hog.

711
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,119
You know, Lloyd...

712
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:03,541
...just when I think you couldn't possibly
be any dumber...

713
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,795
...you go and do something like this...

714
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:11,715
...and totally redeem yourself!

715
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,346
- Still wanna go to Aspen?
- Oh, yeah.

716
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:20,474
- Okay. Let's go, buddy.
- Super!

717
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,606
- Lloyd, no, west. Go west, Lloyd.
- Oh, yeah.

718
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:17,364
I got... I gotta stop
and go to the bathroom.

719
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,284
Just go, man.

720
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,166
That sure is warm.

721
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:30,771
We're there.

722
01:01:39,947 --> 01:01:43,575
Got a little nippy going through the pass,
huh, Har?

723
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,455
Isn't this incredible?

724
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,334
- What more could two single guys ask for?
- How about some food?

725
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,796
I swallowed a big June bug when we
were driving. I'm not really hungry.

726
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,132
Yeah, well, I'm starving.

727
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,051
Jeez, look at the butt on that.

728
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,220
Yeah.

729
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,806
He must work out.

730
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:09,977
Hey. Why don't we get busy
and deliver the briefcase to Mary.

731
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:13,897
If I know her as well as I think I do,
she'll invite us in for tea and strumpets.

732
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,983
Good plan. Where does she live?

733
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,735
I don't know.

734
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:21,280
What's her last name? I'll look it up.

735
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:23,490
Uh...

736
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,535
You know, I don't really recall.

737
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:28,120
It starts with an S.

738
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:31,498
Swim, Swamie, Slippy...

739
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,376
...Slappy, Slimin, Solmon, Simmon...

740
01:02:34,543 --> 01:02:37,004
...Swan, Swenson, Swanson?

741
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:40,132
- Maybe it's on the briefcase. Look on...
- Yeah. It's right here.

742
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,718
Samsonite. I was way off.

743
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:44,595
I knew it started with an S, though.

744
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,348
I'm not seeing it here, Lloyd.

745
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,559
She must be unlisted.

746
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,189
Great.

747
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,691
So, what are we supposed to do now?

748
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,157
I can't feel my fingers anymore, Lloyd.

749
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,868
They're numb.

750
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,707
Maybe you should wear
these extra gloves.

751
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,001
My hands are starting to get sweaty.

752
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,254
Extra gloves?

753
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:24,343
You've had this pair of extra gloves
this whole time?

754
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:29,223
Yeah. We're in the Rockies.

755
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:32,559
I'm going to kill you.

756
01:03:33,894 --> 01:03:35,437
What?

757
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:38,941
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you, Lloyd.

758
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,360
- Calm down.
- Right now. I'm gonna kill you.

759
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:43,570
Harry, you got that crazy look
in your eye.

760
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,410
- I know what I'm gonna do.
- What are you doing?

761
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:53,831
I'm gonna do something
I should have done a long time ago.

762
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,084
Don't do anything foolish, Harry.

763
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,753
What? Foolish? This isn't foolish.

764
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,007
I'm gonna toss this damn curse
right into that damn pond.

765
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,596
- You're an asshole. No! Harry!
- I'm gonna do it.

766
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,598
Stop!

767
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:15,602
Harry...

768
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:17,938
...your hands are freezing.

769
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,693
Harry. Look.

770
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,112
Look. Look.

771
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:33,579
Okay, here's the plan.

772
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:36,707
We borrow a few bucks,
just a small loan, from the briefcase...

773
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:39,418
- ...and we find some reasonable lodgings.
- Good plan.

774
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,962
We'll keep track all the money
we spend with IOU's.

775
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:45,424
We'll be meticulous to the last penny.
Whatever we borrow, we pay back.

776
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:48,677
- Absolute... We're good for it.
- Our word is our bond.

777
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:54,308
This is the Hotel Danbury
presidential suite, gentlemen.

778
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:58,145
Normally reserved for royalty,
visiting dignitaries...

779
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:00,522
...illustrious stars
of stage and screen.

780
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,817
We have shortly coming
the emperor and empress of Japan.

781
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:07,070
And of course, Prince Charles and Di
when they were together...

782
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,616
- ...used to frequent the hotel constantly.
- We'll take it.

783
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,022
There you go.

784
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:45,943
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

785
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,569
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

786
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,279
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

787
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,365
There you go.

788
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:55,452
Hi.

789
01:05:57,788 --> 01:06:01,708
<i>- Rain brought them to him.
- My mother was Sarah Carver.</i>

790
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:05,837
<i>Although at the time he wasn't sure
he wanted to accept the gift.</i>

791
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:08,465
<i>Ned, do you think he'll let us stay?</i>

792
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:13,762
<i>No, this place is ugly anyway.
You and me, we're family.</i>

793
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,555
<i>I promise never to take you away.</i>

794
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,725
<i>And no one's ever gonna break us apart.</i>

795
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:22,354
<i>At Pacific Bell,
we believe that's pretty special.</i>

796
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,232
Oh, boy. This is living, huh?

797
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:27,567
- Yeah.
- What's on next?

798
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,028
I don't know. Let me look it up.

799
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,366
Lloyd, you okay?

800
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:35,742
Harry...

801
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,577
...it's Mary.

802
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,664
- Who?
- Mary. With the briefcase?

803
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,917
"Mary Swanson."

804
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:48,922
"Swanson. Will host a newl..."

805
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,757
- "Host annual."
- "Host..."

806
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,217
..."annual"

807
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:55,262
- "Annual."
- "...annual meeting of..."

808
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:59,099
"T... T... Tehe... Teh..."

809
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,268
- "The. Yeah."
- "...the..."

810
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,770
- "...inter... "
- "It's a big one."

811
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:06,857
"International Preservationists Society
tomorrow night."

812
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:13,905
Well, come on, Cinderella,
we gotta get you ready for the ball.

813
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,634
Yeah!

814
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,894
Thanks, Barn.

815
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,522
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

816
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,580
You're right.

817
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,416
Okay, okay, okay.

818
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:33,086
- Cripes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

819
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,427
Time out.

820
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,053
Okay, time out. Whatever.

821
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,391
Excuse me, gentlemen.
This is a $500-a-plate dinner. Good night.

822
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:49,269
Oh, 500. Oh, okay.
All right, no problem.

823
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:52,230
Here, put us down for...
Put us down for four.

824
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,566
In case we want seconds.

825
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,240
Jesus Christ.

826
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:03,533
It's them.

827
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,370
- Them who?
- Them. The guys who whacked Mental.

828
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,999
Can't you just feel it, Harry?

829
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:13,460
This is our big chance, man.

830
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:16,922
All we gotta do is show a little class,
a little sophistication...

831
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,341
- ...and we're in like a dirty shirt.
- No problem.

832
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:22,636
We can be classy and sophis...
Look at the funbags on that hosehound.

833
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,179
I'd like to eat her liver...

834
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:27,974
...with some farver beans
and a nice bottle of Chianti.

835
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,646
Come on. Let's go get bowls
of loudmouth soup.

836
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,397
Yeah.

837
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:39,402
- Hey, bartender, two martinis, please.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

838
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,780
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen, your attention, please.</i>

839
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:46,117
The Aspen Preservation Society
is the world's foremost defender...

840
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,079
...of 23 endangered species.

841
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:54,542
And it is with tremendous honor that
we're able to bring Mr. Swanson forward...

842
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:58,755
...to introduce us to the 24th,
everybody. Karl.

843
01:10:58,964 --> 01:11:00,590
Thank you.

844
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,344
Thank you.

845
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:06,680
Ladies and gentlemen...

846
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,766
...I give you the Icelandic Snow Owl.

847
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,317
These magnificent specimens...

848
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:23,863
...constitute one-seventh of the snow owl
population left on the planet.

849
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,657
And God willing...

850
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,827
...with your help
and that of the Society's...

851
01:11:28,994 --> 01:11:32,163
...these wonderful creatures
will flourish once more.

852
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,542
Thank you again
and enjoy your evening.

853
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,213
Could I have some pistachios, please?

854
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:43,633
And another one of those.

855
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:48,263
Lloyd, what are you doing? Would you
calm down? I've never seen you so nervous.

856
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:51,266
Keep an eye on them, Shay.

857
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:52,642
Keep a close eye.

858
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,728
I'm ready for commitment, Harry.

859
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,731
First time I set eyes
on Mary Swanson...

860
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,401
...I just got that old-fashioned
romantic feeling...

861
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,029
...where I'd do anything to bone her.

862
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:07,741
- That's a special feeling, Lloyd. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

863
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,036
Oh, my. There she is.

864
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:13,496
Wow, you weren't kidding, Lloyd.

865
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:14,914
She's an angel.

866
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:20,587
What are you waiting for?
Get over there and talk to her.

867
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,929
She's gonna think I'm a psycho when she
finds out how far I came just to see her.

868
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:31,931
You know what you have. Her briefcase.

869
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:34,726
She's gonna be thrilled to see you.

870
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,772
Wait, I have an idea.

871
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:44,194
Why don't you go over
and introduce yourself...

872
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:48,448
...and that way you can build me up
so I won't have to brag about myself later.

873
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:54,537
Tell her I'm rich and I'm good-looking
and I have a rapist wit.

874
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,664
No. I don't... No. I don't think I could.

875
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,959
- No, I'm not... That's not...
- Come on, please. Oh, Har, please.

876
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:02,587
- Please.
- Okay, okay, okay, stop.

877
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:04,464
What are you gonna do?

878
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,800
I'm gonna hang by the bar...

879
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,010
...put out the vibe.

880
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:10,970
Okay.

881
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,817
Nice set of hooters you got there.

882
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:28,655
- I beg your pardon.
- The owls. They're beautiful.

883
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,033
Oh.

884
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,077
Yeah.

885
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,579
Are you a bird lover?

886
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,874
Me? Oh, no.
Well, I used to have a parakeet...

887
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:44,254
...but now my main area
of expertise is canines.

888
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,674
Dogs, to the layperson.

889
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,968
Thanks.

890
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,471
I love dogs too.

891
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,350
- So how are you involved with them?
- Oh, I... You know, I've trained them.

892
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:00,186
You know, bathed them, clipped them.
I've even bred them.

893
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,522
Oh, really? Any unusual breeding?

894
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,357
No, mostly just doggie style.

895
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:10,155
One time, we successfully
mated a bulldog with a Shih Tzu.

896
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,867
Really? That's weird.

897
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:16,369
Yeah, we called it a bullshit.

898
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:32,343
Oh, I'm... Anyway, the real reason
I came over here was to...

899
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,221
I gotta introduce you to a buddy of mine.

900
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,891
Oh, Mary, I don't believe
I've met your friend.

901
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,227
Oh, well, actually,
we haven't been properly introduced.

902
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:42,854
My name is Mary Swanson.

903
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:45,398
- Hi, Harry Dunne.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

904
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:46,900
This is my stepmother, Helen.

905
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,736
Hi, Harry Dunne.
Pleasure to meet you both.

906
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:53,490
Well, I saw you come in.
I was hoping I'd get a chance to meet you.

907
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,700
- You were? Really.
- Yes.

908
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:58,119
That tuxedo, it's fabulous.

909
01:14:58,286 --> 01:15:00,330
Really, I love a man
with a sense of humor.

910
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,291
Really. And so does Mary.
It's hysterical.

911
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:05,251
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

912
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:10,590
Anyway, yeah, about my friend...
What are you doing tomorrow?

913
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:13,218
Mary is looking for someone
to hit the slopes with.

914
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,678
She what? Huh?

915
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:18,056
Helen, you're embarrassing me.

916
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:19,516
Yeah, well, you are.

917
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,393
After all, the snow's gonna be gone
in a couple of weeks...

918
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,105
...and this may be your last chance.
She never gets a chance to get out.

919
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:29,025
Well, what do you say, Mr. Dunne?
Are you available?

920
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,612
- I don't know. My friend...
- Forget about your friend for one day.

921
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,740
I think you kids will have a wonderful
time. What do you say?

922
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:42,497
Well, you know, I don't know, you know,
the thing, part... Sure, what time?

923
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,879
How come you didn't bring her over?

924
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:53,967
Relax, you're golden.
I got you a date with her tomorrow.

925
01:15:54,133 --> 01:16:00,181
Oh, you are... What?
I can't... This... I love you, man.

926
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:02,475
Okay, okay, you're kissing me.

927
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:05,019
- You're kissing me, Lloyd...
- I love you.

928
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,313
Oh, God.

929
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,650
This calls for a little of the bubbly.

930
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:12,485
- You're gonna be my best man.
- Good.

931
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:13,695
- I promise.
- Thank you.

932
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:18,241
You have just earned yourself a seat
at the head table, pal.

933
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:19,993
And we already got the tuxes.

934
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,965
Boy, this party really died.

935
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:42,515
Hey, maybe it was a coincidence.

936
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,393
"Hey, maybe it was a coincidence."

937
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,855
It was a message, Shay, pure and simple.

938
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:53,526
I mean, we killed their bird.
Now they killed one of ours.

939
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:58,615
How could anybody whack a bird
with a cork?

940
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,367
These guys aren't just anybody.

941
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,286
They're good.

942
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,794
Mary Christmas.

943
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,298
Mrs. Mary Christmas.

944
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:17,967
Kind of catchy, huh, Har?

945
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,927
Yeah, yeah, that sounds nice, Lloyd...

946
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:23,181
...but, don't you think you
might be jumping the gun a little bit?

947
01:17:23,348 --> 01:17:24,849
I mean, you know. Who knows?

948
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:29,187
Maybe once you get to know her,
you'll find out that she's not your type.

949
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,857
Hey!

950
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:37,028
Don't you ever say that again.

951
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,530
She is the love of my life!

952
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,783
The blood in my veins.

953
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,743
We belong together!

954
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:47,747
Till the mountains fall into the sea,
till the heavens collide...

955
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:51,668
...or until I get sick of her and need
to move on. You hear me?

956
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,961
Okay, okay, okay. Lloyd, just calm down.

957
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,005
Just calm down.

958
01:17:57,507 --> 01:17:59,133
Okay.

959
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,052
Now.

960
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,389
Let me get this straight.

961
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,266
Lobby bar in the lobby.

962
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:11,479
Yeah, that's what she said.
She'll meet you there at 10:00 sharp.

963
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,649
- Okay.
- Okay.

964
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,737
Where you going in that getup?

965
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:24,367
I just thought when, you know,
you'd be off making your love connection...

966
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,370
...I'd be out,
trying my luck on the slopes.

967
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:31,582
You mean you're gonna go out
in public dressed in tights?

968
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:33,292
No, these aren't tights, Lloyd.

969
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,421
These are fashionable
Eurotrash ski trousers.

970
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,214
Pretty revealing.

971
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,299
Really?

972
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:44,637
Yeah, but it's just a tiny lump.
No one will notice.

973
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:48,182
You're right.
I can't go out dressed like this.

974
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:07,618
Hey! Coming!

975
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:15,168
Nice going, buddy.

976
01:19:30,725 --> 01:19:32,185
Ma'am.

977
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:38,357
Beautiful outfit, sir.

978
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:41,861
There you go.

979
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,206
Hey.

980
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,540
How you doing?

981
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:58,294
You're a little early.
We don't open for about 45 minutes.

982
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:01,547
I'm meeting someone here.

983
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:03,633
Mind if I wait at the bar?

984
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,009
No, come on in.

985
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,556
It's a beautiful day, huh, Harry?

986
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:14,393
Yes, yes, I've had a wonderful time so far.
Thank you.

987
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,897
God, it feels so good to get up here.

988
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:20,858
I haven't been outside that much
in the last couple of weeks.

989
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:22,860
Oh, yeah? Why not?

990
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:27,573
There's been some family problems...

991
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,909
...but I don't wanna bore you with those.

992
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:31,619
Thanks.

993
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,914
Oh, look. Frost.

994
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:40,211
Harry?

995
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:48,094
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. I just... I do this all the time.

996
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,318
Hi there.

997
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:07,154
Say, kids.

998
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,950
You wouldn't happen to have a cup
of warm water, would you?

999
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,584
Excuse me.

1000
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,295
Is it 10 a.m. yet?

1001
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:25,590
It's 1.

1002
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,635
That's what I have too.

1003
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,429
I thought maybe it was fast.

1004
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,184
She's running late, huh?

1005
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,437
Just a couple hours.

1006
01:21:39,604 --> 01:21:40,771
You know girls.

1007
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:43,399
When they're excited about something...

1008
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:46,444
...everything has to be perfect.

1009
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,078
This one's on me.

1010
01:21:57,622 --> 01:21:59,498
Yippee.

1011
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:02,293
Chablis, please.

1012
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,712
Hello.

1013
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:13,012
Bad day, huh?

1014
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:16,015
Me too.

1015
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:20,269
Of course, everything's been bad
since I broke up with my boyfriend.

1016
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,206
My God.

1017
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:41,749
You poor guy. Does it hurt?

1018
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:45,586
Oh, no. I'm fine. I saved a seat for you.

1019
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:47,713
Oh, no. Listen, this is silly.

1020
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,674
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no.

1021
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,051
It will only hurt for a moment,
like a Band-Aid.

1022
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:53,928
- Come on, ready?
- No, no, no.

1023
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:56,472
- No.
- Come on. Go.

1024
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,938
Let go! Help! Help!

1025
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:36,155
Come on. Come on, come on.

1026
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:45,331
What am...?

1027
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:53,506
I said to myself, "Run, Beth. Run for your
life before this man kills you both."

1028
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,800
Then do you know what the klutz did?

1029
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:59,303
No, and I don't care.

1030
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,181
I'm gonna tell you.
He came home one night dead drunk...

1031
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,434
...and decided he wanted to fix the sink.
I couldn't believe him.

1032
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,854
Anyway, enough about me. Let's talk
about you. How come you're here?

1033
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,523
- Bartender.
- How come?

1034
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:13,526
Yeah?

1035
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,779
You wouldn't happen
to know a Mary Swanson, would you?

1036
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,697
Mary Swanson?

1037
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:22,034
Yeah, she comes in here all the time.

1038
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,704
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She has dinner.

1039
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,665
Oh.

1040
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:30,334
I'm sorry.

1041
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,633
Do you know where she lives?

1042
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:41,720
Yeah, her family has the big place
up on Alpine Drive.

1043
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:43,514
Alpine Drive?

1044
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:45,391
Big place?

1045
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,109
No way.

1046
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,654
That's great.

1047
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:00,865
We landed on the moon!

1048
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:11,000
I've gotta tell you,
today was just what I needed.

1049
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,251
Thanks a lot, Harry.

1050
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,378
Oh, it was...

1051
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,756
It was my pleasure, Mary.

1052
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,468
So you'll pick me up tonight at 7:45?

1053
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,138
Well, no. I got a few things
to take care of first.

1054
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:26,932
But why don't we make it quarter to 8?

1055
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,518
Stop it.

1056
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,897
Okay, 7:45.

1057
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:37,693
Bye.

1058
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:25,407
It doesn't make any sense, Lloyd.
She told me 10:00 sharp.

1059
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:27,701
Are you sure you went to the right bar?

1060
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,537
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1061
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,623
I'm pretty sure.

1062
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,959
Lobby bar, right in the lobby.

1063
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,836
Well...

1064
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,965
Maybe she just had a change of heart.

1065
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,468
Oh, that pisses me off.
That pisses me right off.

1066
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,345
I hate when women do that, you know?

1067
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:49,348
She wanted to see you again.
She told me that.

1068
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:52,309
And now, no? Now...
Wait a minute. Wait.

1069
01:27:53,394 --> 01:27:55,980
She must have meant 10:00 at night.

1070
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,024
Do you think?

1071
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:02,444
Why would she have you meet her
at a bar at 10 in the morning?

1072
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,697
I just figured she was a raging alcoholic.

1073
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:11,328
Oh, that's the...

1074
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:16,667
And all this time I've been going
through such pain and personal anguish.

1075
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,712
Such hell, for nothing.

1076
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:23,549
Oh, God, that's funny.
Oh, that's good stuff.

1077
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:27,136
Oh, boy. Well, looks like you
got your night planned...

1078
01:28:27,303 --> 01:28:29,179
...so I'm gonna head out, catch a flick.

1079
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:30,389
Okay.

1080
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:34,893
Ten in the morning.

1081
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:54,872
Hey, Harry, old buddy, old pal.

1082
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:56,582
Yeah?

1083
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,585
Will you join me in a good-luck toast
before you head out?

1084
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:02,463
Sure. Whatever you think
will help your chances.

1085
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:05,424
Yes, sirree.

1086
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:08,469
You know why I like you, Harry?

1087
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:10,387
Because you're a regular guy.

1088
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:12,765
Yep.

1089
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,434
That's why I want you to stay regular.

1090
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:20,481
One half-teaspoon for
fast, effective relief.

1091
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,421
To my friend, Harry...

1092
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:45,631
...the matchmaker.

1093
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:50,135
Get out of here. I'm... I've...

1094
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:55,307
Mm. Mm-mm.

1095
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:18,705
<i>Hi, the door's open. Come on upstairs.</i>

1096
01:30:23,836 --> 01:30:24,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

1097
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:27,714
Hi. Make yourself at home.
I'm almost ready. One minute?

1098
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:30,509
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Okay.

1099
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:56,762
Harry? Are you in there?

1100
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,932
Be right out.

1101
01:32:00,307 --> 01:32:02,768
I hope you're not using the toilet.
It's broken.

1102
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:06,522
Huh?

1103
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,066
The toilet doesn't flush.

1104
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:11,902
No, I was just shaving.

1105
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:13,946
Shaving?

1106
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:19,201
Yeah, I was running a little late.
I thought this would save some time.

1107
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:22,996
Okay.

1108
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:25,249
I'll be in the kitchen
whenever you're ready.

1109
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,170
Oh, jeez.

1110
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,646
<i>Tomorrow on A Current Affair...</i>

1111
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:50,482
<i>...inside the home
of the Menendez brothers' attorney.</i>

1112
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:52,568
<i>And next, we'll be back in a minute...</i>

1113
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:56,488
<i>...with the heartbreaking story
of the blind Rhode Island boy...</i>

1114
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:59,992
<i>...who was duped
into buying a dead parakeet.</i>

1115
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,829
<i>I just thought he was real quiet.</i>

1116
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,127
Who are these sick people?

1117
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:17,426
- Hi.
- Hi.

1118
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,136
Yes?

1119
01:33:19,595 --> 01:33:20,637
Remember me?

1120
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:24,975
Not really.

1121
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:28,687
Providence. Providence.

1122
01:33:29,146 --> 01:33:31,148
I drove you to the airport last week.

1123
01:33:31,315 --> 01:33:33,609
Oh, my God.

1124
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,611
Lloyd, right?

1125
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:39,114
You remembered my name.

1126
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:41,658
What are you doing in Aspen?

1127
01:33:41,825 --> 01:33:43,493
I brought you your briefcase.

1128
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,913
You left it at the airport, you big goof.

1129
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:49,207
- You have my briefcase?
- Yeah.

1130
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,377
Hey, I have it at my hotel room.

1131
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:56,548
Wanna jump on the bike with me?
We can go get it. Unless...

1132
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:59,301
Unless you're busy. I'll...

1133
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:01,303
- Oh, no. No.
<i>- No...</i> No, I don't wanna...

1134
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,639
- You just wait right here, okay?
- Okay.

1135
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:11,730
Come on, flush, you bastard.

1136
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:17,361
Harry, what are you doing in there?

1137
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:22,574
Uh... Uh...
I'm just... I'm cleaning my teeth.

1138
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,174
Harry?

1139
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:41,343
I'm gargling.

1140
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:43,929
Just give me a minute, Mary.
I'll be right with you.

1141
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:48,558
Harry, I'm sorry, but something important
has come up and I've got to run out.

1142
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:51,103
It's sort of an emergency.
I'll explain later.

1143
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,438
- But, Marry?
- I'm sorry, Harry.

1144
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:56,900
I've really got to go.
I promise we'll do this again sometime.

1145
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:10,872
Race you to the top.

1146
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,085
Come here.

1147
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:21,007
Yeah!

1148
01:35:22,968 --> 01:35:24,636
I won.

1149
01:35:25,137 --> 01:35:27,264
Look familiar?

1150
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,642
- I don't believe it. You really have it.
- Of course I have it.

1151
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:33,228
When Lloyd Christmas drives a woman
to the airport...

1152
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:36,481
...he makes sure she gets her luggage.
That's my whole philosophy.

1153
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,150
This is incredible.

1154
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:42,654
You mean to say you drove 2000 miles
just for me?

1155
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:50,078
I didn't really have a lot to do,
you know...

1156
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:53,165
...and I know how frustrating it can be
to lose a bag.

1157
01:35:55,167 --> 01:35:57,335
That is so sweet, Lloyd.

1158
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,310
Look, Mary.

1159
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:17,397
I know this may seem a little sudden
but I've given it a lot of thought.

1160
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:20,192
You're the woman I've been waiting
for my whole life...

1161
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:23,487
...and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
Please...

1162
01:36:24,237 --> 01:36:26,114
...let me finish.

1163
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:29,951
I'm crazy about you.

1164
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:33,246
I've never felt this way about anybody.

1165
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:38,710
Listen to me.
I feel like a schoolboy again.

1166
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:44,090
A schoolboy who desperately wants
to make sweet, sweet love to you.

1167
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,896
I thought I heard you talking to someone.

1168
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:01,107
Mary.

1169
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:11,076
I desperately wanna make love
to a schoolboy.

1170
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,497
- Maybe I should be going.
- No, no.

1171
01:37:17,582 --> 01:37:19,125
No, I've...

1172
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:21,419
That's not what I meant.

1173
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:27,926
What I meant was...

1174
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:35,058
...I like you, Mary.

1175
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:42,732
I like you a lot...

1176
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:47,237
...and I wanna ask you a question,
straight out, flat out...

1177
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:50,073
...and I want you
to give me the honest answer.

1178
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:56,538
What do you think the chances are
of a guy like you and a girl like me...

1179
01:37:58,415 --> 01:37:59,875
...ending up together?

1180
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:04,963
Well, Lloyd, that's difficult to say.
We really don't...

1181
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:07,799
Hit me with it.
Just give it to me straight.

1182
01:38:07,966 --> 01:38:10,802
I came a long way
just to see you, Mary. Just...

1183
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:12,888
The least you can do is level with me.

1184
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:15,140
What are my chances?

1185
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:17,225
Not good.

1186
01:38:22,188 --> 01:38:25,984
You mean "not good"
like one out of a hundred?

1187
01:38:26,151 --> 01:38:28,153
I'd say...

1188
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:31,031
...more like one out of a million.

1189
01:38:36,703 --> 01:38:40,165
So you're telling me there's a chance.

1190
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,627
Yeah!

1191
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:47,756
I read you.

1192
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:56,014
Hi.

1193
01:38:56,181 --> 01:38:57,724
We have plenty of towels. Thanks.

1194
01:38:57,891 --> 01:39:00,185
Nicholas. What are you doing here?

1195
01:39:00,352 --> 01:39:03,855
I've been looking for you, Mary.
I have some news about your husband.

1196
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:07,025
Husband?

1197
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:09,319
Wait a minute.

1198
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:13,615
What was all that one-in-a-million talk?

1199
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,369
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

1200
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:25,210
Hey, Harry. You never called.

1201
01:39:26,211 --> 01:39:28,046
What are you doing here?

1202
01:39:31,925 --> 01:39:33,134
Excuse me, gunman.

1203
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:36,638
- Who are you?
- Oh, don't play dumb with me, asshole.

1204
01:39:36,805 --> 01:39:40,517
I'm the rightful owner of that briefcase
that you've been carrying around.

1205
01:39:40,809 --> 01:39:42,894
Oh, well, then.

1206
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:45,897
Nicholas, my family trusted you.

1207
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:47,565
Shut up.

1208
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:51,861
Listen, Mr. Samsonite,
about the briefcase.

1209
01:39:52,028 --> 01:39:55,573
My friend Harry and I have every intention
of fully reimbursing you.

1210
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:58,243
What are you talking about?

1211
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:00,245
You open it up. Open it up.

1212
01:40:00,704 --> 01:40:02,080
Go ahead. Open it up.

1213
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:03,915
Do what he says.

1214
01:40:04,082 --> 01:40:05,500
Hurry.

1215
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:14,050
What is this? What is this?
Where's all the money?

1216
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:16,803
That's as good as money, sir.

1217
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,763
Those are IOU's.

1218
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:21,766
Go ahead and add it up.
Every Cent's accounted for.

1219
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:23,351
Look.

1220
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:25,562
See this? That's a car.

1221
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:28,940
Two hundred and seventy-five thou.
Might wanna hang on to that one.

1222
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,697
You're a dead man. You're a dead man!

1223
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:42,203
Lloyd?

1224
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,372
I'm home.

1225
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,125
Look, we've gotta have a serious talk.

1226
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:48,793
I got a confession to make.

1227
01:40:49,169 --> 01:40:52,547
Oh, good. You found her.
I'll leave you two alone.

1228
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:55,216
No, stay.

1229
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:04,100
Yes, I'd like a one-way ticket
to Amsterdam...

1230
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:06,644
...departing as soon as possible, please.

1231
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:09,647
Okay, how do you guys
know each other?

1232
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:13,276
- We used to be best friends.
- Yeah, until he turned into a backstabber.

1233
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:16,237
Me a backstabber?
You got a lot of nerve.

1234
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:18,323
- You knew I was crazy about her.
- Yeah.

1235
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,492
You knew I was crazy
about Fraida Felcher...

1236
01:41:20,658 --> 01:41:22,744
...and that didn't stop you, did it?

1237
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:25,580
What do you mean?

1238
01:41:25,747 --> 01:41:27,707
"What do you mean?"
Don't deny it, Lloyd.

1239
01:41:27,874 --> 01:41:31,127
Fraida told me the whole sleazy story,
Mr. French Tickler.

1240
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:37,258
Okay, what time does it...?
What time does that leave?

1241
01:41:37,801 --> 01:41:39,511
Thank you. Hey, wait a second.

1242
01:41:39,677 --> 01:41:41,012
Can I have a vegetarian meal?

1243
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:44,182
We both learned something
about each other today, didn't we?

1244
01:41:44,349 --> 01:41:45,433
Yeah, you said it, pal.

1245
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,353
- We're not as good friends as we thought.
- Yeah, guess not.

1246
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,231
I mean, if one beautiful girl
can rip us apart like this...

1247
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:54,859
...then our friendship isn't worth a damn.
We should call quits right now.

1248
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:59,030
- You just tell me where to sign, bud.
- Right on my ass, after you kiss it.

1249
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:02,826
Kiss it? You kiss mine.
Both cheeks, both lips, right here.

1250
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:07,705
- Come on, come on. Put it right...
- Shut up.

1251
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:11,209
Now, which one of you losers
wants to get it first?

1252
01:42:13,086 --> 01:42:14,504
Over here.

1253
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,924
I was the one that got you
into this whole mess.

1254
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:20,051
Come on, shoot me.

1255
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,178
No, wait.

1256
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:23,721
Wait, no, no. Do me first.

1257
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:26,182
- I stole your girl. I deserve it.
- No, you don't.

1258
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:28,017
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. No.

1259
01:42:28,184 --> 01:42:31,563
Yes, I do. Yesterday was one
of the greatest days of my life.

1260
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:35,817
Mary and I went skiing,
we made a snowman, she touched my leg.

1261
01:42:35,984 --> 01:42:37,902
Okay, kill him.

1262
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:47,162
Oh, no.

1263
01:42:48,997 --> 01:42:51,875
You killed my best friend, you bastard!

1264
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,378
Well, if it's any consolation,
you're about to be reunited.

1265
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:03,261
Harry.

1266
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:06,014
You're alive!

1267
01:43:06,556 --> 01:43:08,391
And you're a horrible shot.

1268
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:13,188
- Lucky me.
- Police officers! Nobody move!

1269
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:16,357
Everybody freeze!
All right, get those hands up!

1270
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:17,859
Not you, dummy.

1271
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:19,611
- Get the gun.
- Look out, look out.

1272
01:43:19,777 --> 01:43:22,197
Special Officer Beth Jordan, FBI.

1273
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:24,699
Hey. Who? But... Huh?

1274
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:28,703
Mr. Dunne, thank you very much.
We couldn't have done it without you.

1275
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,789
We've been following you guys
all the way from Providence.

1276
01:43:32,207 --> 01:43:34,459
What's going on, Harry?

1277
01:43:34,626 --> 01:43:37,045
Your name is Harry, isn't it?

1278
01:43:37,212 --> 01:43:40,298
Yeah, she grabbed me down in the lobby,
explained what was up...

1279
01:43:40,465 --> 01:43:44,594
...and then they slapped this bulletproof
vest on me and gave me a gun.

1280
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:48,765
But what if he shot you in the face?

1281
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,435
What if he shot me in the face?

1282
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:54,812
That's a risk we were willing to take.

1283
01:43:54,979 --> 01:43:56,898
How come I didn't get a gun?

1284
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:58,983
Did you get a gun?

1285
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:28,888
You were right, Lloyd.

1286
01:44:29,055 --> 01:44:31,474
She was definitely worth the trip.

1287
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:33,685
Yeah.

1288
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:36,187
She's something, ain't she, Har?

1289
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:38,231
I'm glad we were able to help her out.

1290
01:44:38,398 --> 01:44:39,607
Yep.

1291
01:44:48,032 --> 01:44:49,409
- Bobby.
- Easy, easy.

1292
01:44:49,575 --> 01:44:53,329
- You're okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm okay, I'm just a little sore.

1293
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:57,333
- Oh, sweetie.
- Oh, baby, I missed your loving.

1294
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,460
There's someone
I want to introduce you to.

1295
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,880
He's kindest, gentlest man I've ever met.
Will you meet him?

1296
01:45:03,047 --> 01:45:04,048
- Sure.
- Okay.

1297
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:05,383
He's got a gun!

1298
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:11,764
- Die!
- Lloyd, Lloyd.

1299
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:13,308
Huh?

1300
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:16,477
I said, this is my husband, Bobby.

1301
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:19,564
- Oh. Hi, Bobby.
- Hi.

1302
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:22,400
I'm so happy for you.

1303
01:45:23,443 --> 01:45:27,030
Thank you. Thank you both very much.

1304
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:31,117
I owe you both a debt of gratitude.

1305
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:33,161
Thank you.

1306
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,931
I can't believe this, Lloyd.

1307
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:57,852
First, Mary dumps us,
then the cops take our nest egg...

1308
01:45:58,019 --> 01:45:59,479
...and then our hog breaks down.

1309
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:03,316
Yeah. When are we ever
gonna catch a break?

1310
01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:18,247
Hi, y'all.

1311
01:46:19,624 --> 01:46:20,625
Hey, guys.

1312
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:24,295
We're going on a national bikini tour,
and we're looking for two oil boys...

1313
01:46:24,462 --> 01:46:26,756
...who can grease us up
before each competition.

1314
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:33,971
You are in luck.

1315
01:46:34,389 --> 01:46:39,811
There's a town about three miles that way.
I'm sure you'll find a couple guys there.

1316
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:45,108
- Okay, thanks.
- Bye.

1317
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:56,494
Do you realize what you've done?

1318
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:59,497
- Hey. Wait!
- Lloyd!

1319
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:02,667
Lloyd!

1320
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:15,555
You'll have to excuse my friend.
He's a little slow.

1321
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:19,267
The town is back that way.

1322
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,862
Wow.

1323
01:47:31,028 --> 01:47:33,239
Two lucky guys are gonna be
driving around...

1324
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:36,492
...with those girls
for the next couple of months.

1325
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:38,119
Yeah.

1326
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:40,997
Don't worry, we'll catch our break too.

1327
01:47:41,164 --> 01:47:43,708
Just gotta keep our eyes open.

1328
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,293
Yep.

1329
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,297
You're it.

1330
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:51,507
- You're it.
- You're it. Quitsies.

1331
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:56,471
- You're it. Anti-quitsies, double stamp.
- You're it. Anti-quitsies, triple stamp.

1332
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:58,347
- No erasies.
- You can't triple stamp.

1333
01:47:58,514 --> 01:48:00,641
- Can't triple stamp a double stamp.
- You can.

1334
01:48:00,808 --> 01:48:03,561
You can't triple stamp.
Lloyd, you can't triple a double stamp.

1335
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,648
You can't triple stamp. That's the rule.
You can't triple.

1336
01:48:07,815 --> 01:48:13,196
You can't triple stamp a double stamp,
Lloyd. Lloyd! Lloyd!
