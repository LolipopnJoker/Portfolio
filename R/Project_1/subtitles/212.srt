1
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:53,996
This is the Earth at a time
when the dinosaurs roamed...

2
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,555
a lush and fertile planet.

3
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:09,445
A piece of rock just six miles wide
changed all that.

4
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,961
It hit with the force
of 10,000 nuclear weapons.

5
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:28,158
A trillion tons of dirt and rock
hurtled into the atmosphere...

6
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:31,045
creating a suffocating
blanket of dust...

7
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:33,482
the sun was powerless
to penetrate...

8
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,842
for a thousand years.

9
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,598
It happened before.

10
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,638
It will happen again.

11
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:53,285
It's just a question of when.

12
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,681
<i>Engineering director... Engineering...</i>

13
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:14,839
<i>- Say again, Rudy.</i>
- Houston, affirmative.

14
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,796
I'm gonna try again.

15
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,436
<i>This time why don't we put in a hold</i>
<i>at nine. Cancel the pending resume.</i>

16
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:24,081
Almost got it.

17
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:29,476
<i>- Dennis, I'm almost there.</i>
- Houston, Pete's looking real strong.

18
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,877
Okay, Pete. We got that coupling
on the board here now.

19
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:36,078
We'll give you the go-ahead
from down here when it's in alignment.

20
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:38,846
Sounds good.
Give me ten seconds.

21
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,844
His heart rate's racing.

22
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,878
- Hey, Pete. It's Truman.
- <i>Hey.</i>

23
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,963
- How you doing up there, Hoss?
- <i>Pretty good.</i>

24
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:49,521
Now, listen, Pete.
We got an eye on your meds here.

25
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,365
I'll give you a buffalo nickel
if you'll calm down just a little bit.

26
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,166
<i>- Can you do that for me?</i>
- Whatever you say.

27
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:58,683
<i>Okay, uh, now we got plenty of time,</i>
<i>buddy, so don't you worry.</i>

28
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:04,878
<i>- Atlantis...</i>
- Okay. Looking good here.

29
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,878
- He's got it.
- He'll be all right.
- Go ahead, <i>Atlantis.</i>

30
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,765
<i>Roger that, Houston.</i>
<i>Suggest we start reeling Pete in.</i>

31
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,158
- The system's down.
- No.

32
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,158
- What the hell is that?
- My Lord.

33
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,841
We're down.

34
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,726
Houston!

35
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,476
- We've lost all contact.
- What happened?

36
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,041
Stewart, play that tape back!

37
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:52,600
<i>Houston!</i>

38
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,205
Multiple bogeys! Multiple bogeys!

39
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:59,126
Sector five, niner. I have three.
Now five. Unidentified tracts.

40
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:02,040
- My screen's full.
- Multiple tracts headed towards
the Atlantic seaboard.

41
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:05,324
This could be
a surprise missile attack.

42
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:12,404
Mr President, the shuttle <i>Atlantis</i>
just exploded in space.

43
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:14,318
Okay, I want three groups!

44
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,637
One: Internal malfunction.

45
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,201
Get the log tape. Start working back.
Maybe it's a glitch.

46
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:24,480
Two: I want NORAD Space Command
and the 50th Tactical comparing all
the space junk you track in every orbit.

47
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:26,643
I want you to check, recheck
and then do it all over again.

48
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:29,605
Number three: Wild cards,
anything and everything.

49
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,678
All right? Now, big Ross,
I want you to get on the telephone.

50
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:34,366
- Wake up 11,000 people.
- Right.
- Walt, get 'em going.

51
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,318
- Let's go!
- Karl!

52
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,439
Karl! Karl!

53
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:46,481
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's
been on the table almost ten hours.

54
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,956
- I want a divorce.
- Dottie, I'm on to something big here.

55
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,164
L-I don't know what this is, but it
looks like something's burning up there.

56
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:56,081
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book. Get those names
of those guys from NASA.

57
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:00,763
Excuse me! Am I wearing a sign
that says, "Karl's slave"?

58
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:05,358
Go get my goddam phone book!
Get the book!

59
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,199
Get the book!
Get the book!

60
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:15,321
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.

61
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,564
- It might just be pieces of
the shuttle breaking up as it comes in.
- Yeah, it might be Santa Claus.

62
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:21,798
Until we get definitive, reliable
alternative confirmation, General...

63
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,843
we go to defcon three.

64
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:32,442
<i>I'm getting ready for the big time</i>

65
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:36,878
<i>Someday you're gonna say</i>
<i>I'm big time too</i>

66
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,400
Hey, little man! Little Richard!

67
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:42,804
Me and you, man!
We going to the top, baby! Big time!

68
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,355
Yo, man, I ain't gonna be ridin'
this bike the rest of my life!

69
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:49,201
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm gettin' a motorcycle, baby.
We gonna travel in style.

70
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:54,483
<i>I'm getting ready for the big time</i>

71
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,956
<i>Someday you're gonna say</i>
<i>I'm big time</i>

72
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:00,756
Watch where you're goin'. I bet you,
none of y'all stop for brothers.

73
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:04,925
Slow down, Little Richard.
You've been ridin' all morning, man.
You gotta take a dump?

74
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:11,200
<i>- We interrupt our regularly</i>
<i>scheduled programme to bring you</i>
<i>this special report.</i>
- Hey, man, what happened?

75
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:16,480
<i>The shuttle</i> Atlantis <i>exploded in space</i>
<i>at 3:47 a.m., Eastern Standard Time.</i>

76
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,206
<i>This morning</i>
<i>NASA officials are denying...</i>

77
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,437
Hey! Hey, get! Get!

78
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:27,160
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!

79
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:31,166
- Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?
- Now that dog's eating my Godzilla, man.

80
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,880
- And what's a little runt like you
gonna do about it?
- Get him, Richard. Sic him.

81
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:38,398
If I wasn't a Christian,
I'd be throwin' your fat,
pineapple-eatin' ass through the window.

82
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:53,206
- Why we not going, huh?
- Well, y-y-you know why?
'Cause this is New York City.

83
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,563
Anything could have happened.
Look at that. Uh, let's see.
It could have been a terrorist bomb.

84
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,957
It could have been
a dead body somebody shot, stabbed.
And it's Friday. Payday too.

85
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:03,283
- Somebody probably jumped,
didn't get their pay cheque. Yes.
- I want to go shopping.

86
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:08,316
Me too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.

87
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,676
- Little Richard.
- Hurry! Right over there!
- Go!

88
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:12,797
Yo, Little Richard!

89
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:14,724
Hang on, Little Richard!
I'm comin'!

90
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't you worry about it.
I'm gonna get you outta there!

91
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:22,562
You okay, buddy?
Don't worry about it. Hang in there.

92
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,956
Somebody dial 911!

93
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,958
My screen's full!
They're all over the place!

94
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,403
Bogeys are breachin'
the atmosphere from Finland down
the North American seaboard.

95
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,446
Whoa!

96
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,244
Look at that!

97
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:55,235
Oh, we at war!

98
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,555
Saddam Hussein is bombin' us!

99
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,598
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

100
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,721
Get out of here!

101
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,877
Oh, my God!

102
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,598
Let's stay focused.
We need to map the trajectory now.

103
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:55,285
- That could take a week.
- Just find it, okay?

104
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,757
- I want to know if the worst is over
or if it's on its way.
- We've got General Kimsey on the line.

105
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:03,318
We've got hits from Finland to South
Carolina. We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?

106
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,677
It's a meteor shower.
That's what took out the shuttle.

107
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,366
- He's waiting for you.
- What's the death toll?

108
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,836
I've got the President
on <i>Air Force One</i> demanding answers.

109
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,240
Is it over?

110
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:18,764
General, we've got 11,000 people
at NASA trying to figure that out
right now. When we know, you'll know.

111
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:27,606
Okay, Karl, listen.
I want you to take your time.
Yes, sir. You are definitely the first.

112
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:32,602
Okay, first coordinate.
One-two-three-nine. 1239, right?

113
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,638
- FBI locked his location.
- Saw an explosion in space.

114
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:39,247
- Okay.
- <i>The last one...</i>

115
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,206
- Now, listen, Karl, this is top secret.
- Sir, I'm retired Navy.
I know all about classified.

116
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:46,637
But one more thing. The person
that finds her gets to name her, right?

117
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:50,800
- Yes, that's right. That's right.
- I want to name her Dottie,
after my wife.

118
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:55,881
- She's a vicious, life-suckin' bitch
from which there's no escape.
- That's... That's sweet, Karl.

119
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,118
S.D.I., this is Flight Director.
I want to get that Hubble movin',
and I want it now.

120
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,926
Roger that.
We're movin' the Hubble!

121
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:13,401
- It's enormous.
- This is the anomaly at 1643.

122
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:18,725
Here is the anomaly at 1658.

123
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:22,157
And here is the anomaly at 1700.

124
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,636
Enough with this
"anomaly" horseshit!

125
00:10:24,687 --> 00:10:27,997
<i>- What is this thing?</i>
- It's an asteroid, sir.

126
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,845
<i>How big are we talking?</i>

127
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:32,798
Sir, our best estimate
is 97.6 billion...

128
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,600
- It's the size of Texas, Mr President.
- Y-Y-Yes, sir.

129
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,917
<i>Dan, we didn't</i>
<i>see this thing coming?</i>

130
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,237
Well, our object collision
budget's a million dollars.

131
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,397
That allows us to track
about three percent of the sky.

132
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:45,678
<i>- And begging your pardon, sir,</i>
<i>but it's a big-ass sky.</i>
- And the ones this morning?

133
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:48,156
<i>Uh, those are nothing.</i>
<i>Uh, they're the size of basketballs...</i>

134
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,084
and, uh, Volkswagens,
things like that.

135
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,761
<i>Is this going to hit us?</i>

136
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,516
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.
- What kind of damage are we...

137
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,325
<i>Damage?</i>

138
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,398
Total, sir.

139
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,955
It's what we call a global killer.

140
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,038
The end of mankind.

141
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,038
Doesn't matter where it hits.

142
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:09,357
Nothing would survive,
not even bacteria.

143
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:13,360
My God. What do we do?

144
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:24,885
We have 18 days
before it hits Earth.

145
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,765
- Have mercy.
- Rise and shine!

146
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,725
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

147
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,281
- Fore!
- Stop the drilling!

148
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,198
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling!

149
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,080
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!

150
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:58,078
I gave you 50,000 a year in donations!
What do you think they're
so mad about, Chick?

151
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,965
Well, I think they feel that
drilling for oil is an evil thing.

152
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,845
Do you know how much diesel
that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?

153
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,196
You know, I just found out
something interesting.

154
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:10,326
- Number two chewed 180 feet last night.
- Who do we have to thank for this?

155
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:13,126
Well, I'll give you two guesses,
but you're only gonna need one.

156
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,277
Goddam it, A. J!

157
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,323
A. J!

158
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:22,644
A. J!
A.J., you in here?

159
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:25,116
Oh, that's just perfect.
In bed. Get up!

160
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:29,120
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, I was lookin' for ya.

161
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,998
You're pissed.
Okay, I can see that.

162
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:35,643
No. You know what, A. J?
I'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.

163
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:39,236
- You know I shut down number two
last night, right?
- Yeah, man, I had a hunch on that.

164
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:42,956
Dude, let me tell you somethin'.
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growed up...

165
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:47,279
and you got your own
oil company and $8 million
of your own money on the contract...

166
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,837
you can do whatever comes
into that little A.J. -idiotin' mind
of yours you want...

167
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:54,357
but as long as it says
"Harry Stamper Oil" on the rig
you will not disobey my rules.

168
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,398
- You got that?
- Yeah, I do got it.

169
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:59,638
- Right now, I need to hear
five words from you.
- Uh...

170
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,719
- I'll never do that again.
- Never do that again.

171
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:05,122
I'm a fool. That was idiotic.
L-I mean, that was stupid.

172
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,198
I'm an idiot. I know what name's
on the sign. I'm not... I can't...

173
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,755
- What's going on here?
- What's going on? Well, l-I mean, l...

174
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:13,595
- I screwed up. I'm a little edgy.
- How long you worked for me?
- Five wonderful years.

175
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,605
In five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

176
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:20,083
- Something's going on here.
I'm gonna find out what it is.
- No, no, no. Well...

177
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:24,638
l-I'm turning over a new leaf.
I'm trying to learn from the man.
What would Harry do?

178
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,962
I'm at a loss for words.

179
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:35,640
- Okay, I can explain this.
- You can explain that?

180
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:39,566
- I can.
- I would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

181
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:48,402
- Grace?
- Hi, Harry.

182
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,126
I have asked you repeatedly
to call me Dad.

183
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:54,725
- Sorry, Harry.
- Get up and get your clothes on.

184
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:00,801
You just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

185
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:11,998
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want every strategy we've got
on near-Earth object collision, okay?

186
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:16,683
Any ideas, any programs,
anything you sketched
on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.

187
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:20,840
For 30 years, they questioned
the need for NASA. Today
we're gonna give them the answer.

188
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,275
You know about this, Rockhound?
You knew.

189
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,323
No, l-I had no idea.

190
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,327
Where's Harry?

191
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:35,046
Harry! All right! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I understand, okay?

192
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:37,561
You're mad.
Who-Who wouldn't be mad?

193
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:40,201
- But he's gonna shoot you.
- Nah. No, he's not. Oh, shit.

194
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:46,520
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

195
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,637
Make your peace with God, A.J.

196
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:52,475
- This guy's got a gun, man!
He's shooting at me!
- Harry, this is not funny!

197
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:56,725
- Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!
- So is this a, uh, serious thing?

198
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,037
- Yeah, pretty serious.
- Bear, man!
- What's up?

199
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:01,721
He's shooting at me. Uh, you see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench!

200
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,884
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

201
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,958
Now, I'm not sure that shootin' him
is takin' care of him.

202
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:10,119
- Why don't you put the gun down, boss?
- You don't want none of this, Bear.
Get out of my way.

203
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,163
Just trying to give my man
a head start, that's all.

204
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:16,325
Not to mention the fact that I
don't think you wanna kill the best man
on your crew before we strike oil.

205
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:20,326
Ah, Chick, I ain't gonna kill him.
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.

206
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:23,279
You remember old Frank Marx who
worked with one hand all them years?

207
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:27,246
- Yeah, but he wasn't very good.
- Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

208
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,636
Now honey, go get some clothes on
and get out of the way.

209
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:33,640
- You can't control my life.
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

210
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,958
All right, stop, all right? It was funny
for a minute, it's not funny any more.

211
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:43,835
- Harry, this is illegal, man.
- I'm temporarily insane, Rock.
It's all right.

212
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,319
- Do I look like I'm crazy to you?
- Well...

213
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,477
Harry, hey, just cool down.

214
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,519
- What are you... Okay, stop.
- All right. All right, Harry.

215
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,757
All right. Now, listen, man to man.

216
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,560
I'm serious. I love her.

217
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,444
Way wrong answer.

218
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,840
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

219
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,566
- Stop him!
- You shot him!

220
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:12,325
Bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

221
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,796
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg.

222
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:18,482
Hey, pucker up!
We got clients incoming!

223
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,885
Uh, b-back in, uh, 1974...

224
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,323
w-we first got the-the idea,
the possibility that a, that a meteor
or an asteroid...

225
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:30,082
I need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

226
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,762
Our first feasibility plan was to use
a spread-focus laser generator...

227
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,724
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

228
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:38,002
That's like shooting a B.B. Gun
at a freight train, Doc.

229
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,918
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

230
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:43,397
We want to land a craft,
deploy solar sails.

231
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:46,320
You'll have a great big canopy.
Solar winds will be caught...

232
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:49,638
by these mylar sails.

233
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,683
- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

234
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,362
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

235
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:58,956
That's 431 hours,
15 minutes and 18 seconds.

236
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,607
Time's a luxury we don't have.
What?

237
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,877
Listen, Harry. A.J. Is my choice...
my choice and not yours.

238
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:11,676
He's the only one in your age bracket,
Grace. It's not a choice,
it's a lack of options.

239
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:16,482
I don't know what in the world makes
you think that you have the right
to tell me what to do any more, Harry.

240
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,717
I suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

241
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:20,723
- Not really.
- Since when?

242
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,799
Since I reached the age of 10
and became older than you, Harry.

243
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:25,599
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

244
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:31,284
Look, I understand that you are
handicapped by a natural immaturity
and I forgive you.

245
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,006
I may be an immature father, okay?
But I'm still your employer.

246
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,159
And as your boss I want you
on that crew boat tonight
and back in the office by Monday.

247
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:40,239
- You got that?
- Okay. I quit.

248
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:44,366
Grace, you can't quit now.
I need you to keep on workin'.

249
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:51,242
- Hi, Harry!
- What are you smilin' about?

250
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:56,202
I've been seein' A.J.
For more than five months, Harry.

251
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,606
You little hypocrite. I ever held you
back once from doin' anything?

252
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,445
What about having a life, Harry?
The first time I got my period...

253
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:05,677
Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax...

254
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,883
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

255
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:13,962
I ju... No, l-I told her how to use it.
I didn't show her, Harry.

256
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:18,723
I was playing
with titanium depth gauges when
I should've been playing with dolls.

257
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,800
I mean, I learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddie Noonan's tattoos.

258
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:25,606
Look, I was raised
on roughnecks by you...

259
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,155
and now you get all shocked and shaken
when I fall in love with one.

260
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:31,603
- So who is the hypocrite here,
Harry, huh? Who?
- Look at those nice pipes up there.

261
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:35,680
- Listen to me, Grace. I want you...
- No, you listen to me, Harry.
I grew up.

262
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,406
With the proximity of the asteroid...

263
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:41,086
and no prep time,
none of our primary plans can work.

264
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:45,325
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

265
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:48,717
- Terrible idea.
- Was I talkin' to you?

266
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:53,722
This is Dr Ronald Quincy from research,
pretty much the smartest man on the
planet. You might want to listen to him.

267
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:58,443
General, if you consider your target...
her composition, her dimensions...

268
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:01,599
her sheer velocity, you could fire
every nuke you've got at her...

269
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,719
and she'll just smile at you
and keep on coming.

270
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:07,037
You should know that the president's
scientific advisors...

271
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:11,564
are suggesting that a nuclear blast
could change this asteroid's trajectory.

272
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:15,196
I know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at M.I.T. Together.

273
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,245
And in a situation like this, you...
you really don't want...

274
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:22,439
to take the advice of a man
who got a C-minus in astrophysics.

275
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:27,396
The president's advisors are,
um, wrong. I'm right.

276
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,523
Hitting the rock from the outside
won't do the job.

277
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:32,917
Imagine a firecracker
in the palm of your hand.

278
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:36,676
You set it off.
What happens? Burn your hand, right?

279
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:40,282
You close your fist around
the same firecracker and set it off...

280
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,761
Your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

281
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,877
Are you suggesting
we blow this thing up from the inside?

282
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:49,680
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- How?

283
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:53,442
We drill. We bring in the world's
best deep-core driller.

284
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,921
Harry, get up here!
We're takin' a hit!

285
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:57,963
- Get A.J. Up here! Whoa!
- Come on!

286
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:02,082
Send another pipe on down!
Right now! Full pipe!

287
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,281
- It's a gas pocket.
- I told you. Am I lucky
or am I just a genius?

288
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:10,279
I shut it down for a reason, you
jackass! The relief valve's fried open.

289
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:17,325
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients outta here now!

290
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:25,921
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

291
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:34,319
Get the hell down!
This thing is gonna blow!

292
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:44,519
Get out! Chick, get out now!

293
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:47,838
Get down!

294
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,879
Three dozen research calls and every
time the same man is recommended.

295
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,117
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

296
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:55,277
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

297
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:58,962
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

298
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:02,403
Somebody could've got killed out here
today. You want that on your conscience?

299
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,838
High thumb. You are man, Harry.

300
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,526
Thumbs high.

301
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,078
You're fired.

302
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,722
Who's Harry Stamper?

303
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:23,321
Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

304
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,916
Mr Stamper, I'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific air forces.

305
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,157
I've been sent here
by the secretary of defence...

306
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,523
on direct orders from the president
of the United States.

307
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,882
It's a matter of urgent
national security.

308
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:38,357
I need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

309
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:41,558
- Crazy Willie put you up to this?
- Afraid I don't know Crazy Willie.

310
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:44,644
Sir, I'm dead serious about this.

311
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,685
- Harry.
- What?

312
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:49,957
Man, I swear to God,
she never told me her age.

313
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:52,800
It's all right.
Relax. It's about me.

314
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,923
Oh. Forget it.

315
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,316
All right, General.
I'll go with ya.

316
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:05,524
On one condition...
we have to take my daughter along.

317
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,483
- What did I do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you guys
takin' her? Wait a minute.

318
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,956
- Sir, stay right here.
- Well...

319
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,402
Chick! Get him paid,
get him off the rig!

320
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:28,359
- Mr Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.

321
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,156
How ya doin'? Miss Stamper.
I'm Dan Truman, executive director here.

322
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,715
- Now listen, on behalf of all of us,
I'd really like to apologize...
- Apologize.

323
00:22:34,807 --> 00:22:37,002
I don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr Truman.

324
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,920
We've been apologized to
for the last 18 and a half hours.

325
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,237
So if you don't mind,
how 'bout if we just get on with it...

326
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,966
and you tell us why we're here
at the NASA space centre?

327
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:49,523
- We should probably talk alone.
- Mr Truman, I don't keep any secrets
from my daughter, Grace.

328
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:52,075
So whether you tell her now or
I tell her later she's gonna find out...

329
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,442
one way or the other,
so why don't we just get on with it?

330
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:58,679
So when the rogue comet hit the asteroid
belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.

331
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,321
For the next 15 days
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

332
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:05,320
Even if the asteroid itself hits
the water, it's still hitting land.

333
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:09,958
It'll flash-boil millions
of gallons of sea water and slam
into the ocean bedrock.

334
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:13,596
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact...
which we think it will be...

335
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:17,965
it'll create a tidal wave three miles
high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour...

336
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:21,357
covering California
and washing up in Denver.

337
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,723
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.

338
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:27,640
Half the world's population'll be
incinerated by the heat blast...

339
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:30,565
and the rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

340
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,484
That's unbelievable.

341
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:36,401
Well, actually,
this is as real as it gets.

342
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,565
Well, it's coming, right now...

343
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:44,599
right for us...
at 22,000 miles an hour.

344
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:47,445
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

345
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,637
I take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

346
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,719
Nobody knows.
That's the way it stays.

347
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:10,367
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world...

348
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,967
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of'em.

349
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:15,925
The president's classified
this information top secret.

350
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,680
If news like this got out,
there'd be an overnight breakdown...

351
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:23,642
of basic social services worldwide...
rioting, mass religious hysteria.

352
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:26,281
Total chaos. You can imagine.

353
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,359
Basically the worst parts
of the Bible.

354
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:35,078
Six billion people on the planet...

355
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,158
why'd you guys call me?

356
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:40,523
- We need you to prep the team
we're sending up.
- Up?

357
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:43,997
We'll send 'em to the asteroid,
they'll land, they'll drill a hole,
they'll drop some nukes...

358
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,880
take off and detonate
if we can fix this equipment problem.

359
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:51,523
Now, the, uh, drilling unit's
a prototype we've been building
for the Mars project.

360
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:55,037
You, uh...
you might recognize the rig.

361
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:59,676
Yeah, well, I guess I should
recognize it. It's my design.

362
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,562
What'd you do?
Steal a key to the patent office?

363
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:07,480
- Yeah, basically.
- Let me get this straight.

364
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:11,679
I got pulled off an oil rig,
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design...

365
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:15,242
couldn't read the plans right
and did a piss-poor job
of putting it together, is that it?

366
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:18,080
- Well, technically,
patents don't apply to outer space.
- Just shut up, Quincy.

367
00:25:18,127 --> 00:25:21,437
It's not going to Mars any more.
It's going to try to save this planet.

368
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,523
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

369
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:25,523
You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?

370
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,883
No, I said you did a piss-poor job
of putting it together.

371
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:31,037
First of all, you got
the flow system all reversed.

372
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:35,319
Let me guess: You've been tearin' up
rotors and you can't figure out why.

373
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:39,201
- Yeah, that's right, actually.
- Well, that's because your cams
are all wrong, Mr Wizard.

374
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:43,035
- Who's been operating this thing?
- Right there.

375
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,159
W-We've actually... we've had them
training for eight months solid now.

376
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,966
- Eight whole months?
- Well, pretty much, yeah.

377
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,357
- Well, gee whiz.
- Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

378
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,403
We need you to train 'em down here.

379
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:56,483
Well, Mr Stamper, what do you think?

380
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:59,206
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.

381
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,442
I'm a third-generation driller,
doin' it all my life...

382
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,995
and I still haven't got it
all figured out.

383
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:07,397
I assume you sent for me because
somebody told you I was the best.

384
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:09,955
Well, I'm only the best
because I work with the best.

385
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:13,596
You don't trust the men you're
working with, you're as good as dead.

386
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,757
Now, you want to send
these boys into space, fine.

387
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:17,838
I'm sure they'll make
good astronauts.

388
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,441
But they don't know jack
about drillin'.

389
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:23,081
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

390
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,840
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

391
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:28,839
- No, we don't have a backup plan.
This is it.
- And this is the best that you could...

392
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:32,442
that the-the government,
the U.S. Government can come up with?

393
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:35,684
I mean, y-you're NASA, for cryin'
out loud. You put a man on the moon.

394
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,918
You're geniuses! Y-You're the guys
that think this shit up.

395
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:41,362
I'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now...

396
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:43,722
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

397
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:46,446
You tellin' me you don't have
a backup plan, that these
eight Boy Scouts right here...

398
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:49,325
that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?

399
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,479
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

400
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:56,963
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

401
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:04,045
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

402
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,561
No spacewalkin',
no crazy astronaut stuff?

403
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:09,326
Just drill.

404
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:11,796
How many men were you plannin'
on takin' up there?

405
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,803
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

406
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:16,037
If I do this,
I'm gonna wanna take my own men.

407
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,163
You got it.

408
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:21,125
So you're saying you'll help us?

409
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,004
Yes, sir.

410
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:25,117
Thanks.

411
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,685
I just don't trust anybody else
to do it, that's all.

412
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:39,526
No, Mrs Curlene,
it's Harry Stamper.

413
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:43,242
If you see Bear, you tell him
Harry's lookin' for him.

414
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:46,797
Those guys get off this rig,
they scatter.J. Otis Curlene Bear...

415
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:50,721
probably the only black man
on a big hog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

416
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:53,201
Come and get Papa Bear!

417
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:58,325
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

418
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,403
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

419
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:06,725
- Oh, that's so sweet, Maxie.
- Hey, did ya get me one of them
yellow jelly bear claws I like?

420
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:08,843
Maxie, are you in trouble
with the law again?

421
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,645
- No, Mama.
- Maxie.

422
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:12,558
I swear, Mama, I'm...

423
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:16,962
- You know I want Rockhound.
- We call him Hound because...

424
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:19,362
well, um, he's horny.

425
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:24,558
Well, you might want to start
with every bar in New Orleans.

426
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:27,480
That is a big, shiny mount,
isn't it?

427
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,757
- How long you been married?
- For two weeks.

428
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,082
- See this diamond?
- Yeah?

429
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,886
- It's not a diamond.
Would you like another drink?
- Yeah.

430
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:37,487
- Sir, FBI.
- She's so cute.

431
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,637
- No, thanks.
- We have a national security matter.

432
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,598
- Good for you.
- Let's go.

433
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:44,844
- Now.
- How old are you?

434
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:48,203
Oscar Choice... spacey
but absolutely brilliant geologist.

435
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,881
He owns a horse ranch
outside of El Paso.

436
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,203
What the...

437
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:02,161
Mr Chick Chapel, at the craps table,
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.

438
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,966
Yes! About time.

439
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:07,362
Charles Chapel, game's over.

440
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:12,838
Who's gonna run the other rig?

441
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,918
How 'bout Benny? He's good.

442
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:17,840
The only one knows
how to run it as well as I do is A.J.

443
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:20,236
I thought you said
you couldn't trust him.

444
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:22,761
I thought you said I could.

445
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:26,446
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

446
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:29,963
Well, you know, bein' in business
for yourself has its advantages...

447
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:33,039
make my own hours,
nobody shoots me in the leg.

448
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,600
You don't got
a gun on ya now, do ya? Oh, good.

449
00:29:37,687 --> 00:29:42,124
'Cause I kinda wanted to get back
to this whole thing
about you askin' me for help.

450
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:47,042
Does that mean that there's actually
a job that Mr All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts...

451
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:50,199
Harry Stamper can't handle by himself...

452
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,715
and needs my expert advice?

453
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:55,401
- Somethin' like that, yeah.
- Well, no, no, no.

454
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:57,955
I mean, is it-it something like that,
or is it that?

455
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,767
You know,
you and me got a real problem.

456
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:04,805
You know, Harry,
there are only, uh...

457
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,845
five words I wanna hear
from you right now.

458
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:12,165
And those words are: "You know, A.J.,
I really look up to you.

459
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:14,715
"You've been a hero of mine
for a long time, and...

460
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:18,083
I'm very impressed with your work;
I'm emotionally closed off."

461
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:20,163
That's like...
that's like 11 words or somethin'.

462
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:25,076
You know what? How about just,
"A.J., I'm sorry, and... and I love ya."

463
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,516
You know, A.J.,
there's not a job on the planet...

464
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,637
that I want you
to work with me on.

465
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:33,518
I mean that.

466
00:30:34,807 --> 00:30:38,720
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

467
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,118
- Big Daddy!
- What's up, baby?

468
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:45,198
Yeah, big Bear.
What's up? What's up?

469
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:51,118
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?

470
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:02,237
None of you have to go.
We can all just sit here on Earth...

471
00:31:02,287 --> 00:31:06,963
wait for this big rock to crash into it,
kill everything and everybody we know.

472
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:12,680
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

473
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:16,476
- Anybody wanna say no?
- Twenty years...

474
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:20,640
haven't turned ya down once,
not about to start now.

475
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:24,999
- I'm there.
- Guess I can't let you
go up there alone.

476
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,805
I'm with you.

477
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,606
I mean, this is...
this is historic.

478
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:32,798
Guys, this is
like deep blue hero stuff.

479
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:37,125
- Of course I'm in.
- While I don't share his enthusiasm...

480
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:41,206
you know me... beam me up, Scotty.

481
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:44,006
- You all right, Max?
- L-I don't... l-I don't...

482
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,682
Whatever you think.

483
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:52,157
- What about you?
- I'm in.

484
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:54,084
All right, then.

485
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,876
We go.

486
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:01,158
I don't mean to be the materialistic
weasel of this group, but...

487
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,397
you think we'll get
hazard pay out of this?

488
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,921
If you're trying to make me feel better
about this scenario, give it up.

489
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,801
To tell you the truth, I'm kind of
encouraged. This guy Chick here was
an Air Force commando for six years.

490
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:13,323
We got robbery, assault,
arrest, resisting arrest.

491
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,604
We got a collection agent
for the mob. Two of these guys
have done serious time.

492
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:18,877
- Look, they're the best at what they do.
- So am I.

493
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,804
And I'm not
so optimistic.

494
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:23,839
We spend $250 billion
a year on defence.

495
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:26,395
And here we are. The fate
of the planet is in the hands...

496
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,007
of a bunch of retards I wouldn't
trust with a potato gun.

497
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:36,358
- So what's the verdict?
- They'll do it.

498
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:39,996
- They've made a few requests though.
- Such as?

499
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:43,524
Just a few things here, uh...

500
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:49,885
Nothing really big, just...
Well, as an example...

501
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:55,365
Uh, Oscar here's got some
outstanding parking tickets.
Wants 'em wiped off his record.

502
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:58,883
- Fifty-six tickets in seven states.
- I'll tell him, Oscar. I got it.

503
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,805
- Okay.
- Uh, Noonan's got two women friends...

504
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,879
that he'd like to see made
American citizens, no questions asked.

505
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:09,279
Max would like you to bring back
eight track tapes.

506
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:13,201
Not sure if that's gonna work,
but let's see what else.

507
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:18,202
Chick wants a full week's Emperor's
<i>Package at Caesar's Palace, um...

508
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,926
Hey, you guys wouldn't
be able to tell us who
actually killed Kennedy, would ya?

509
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:29,124
Uh, Bear would like to stay
at the...

510
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:32,363
White Horse, the...

511
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:34,881
White House.
White House.

512
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:39,836
White House. Yeah, he'd like
to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom
of the White House for the summer.

513
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:43,197
- Stuff like that.
- Sure, I think we can, uh...

514
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,723
take care of some of that.

515
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,644
Harry!

516
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:53,119
Yeah, one more thing. Um...

517
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:56,358
None of them wanna
pay taxes again.

518
00:33:58,087 --> 00:34:00,760
Ever.

519
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:08,640
Who's that for?
Mr Ed?

520
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,402
You stick that in me, I'm gonna
stab you in the heart with it.
You ever see <i>Pulp Fiction?</i>

521
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:17,117
<i>Oh, say can you see</i>

522
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,761
We're losin' him,
we're losin' him. Clear! Kaboom!

523
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:24,685
- Freddie, you all right?
- Does this look okay to you?

524
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:28,806
- Does this look okay?
- It's not all bad. It's kinda tingly.

525
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,242
Mr Chapel, you're next!

526
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:34,125
Oh, gee, lady,
I just came here to drill.

527
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,038
Oh, so did I.

528
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:41,283
Your triglycerides
are way high...

529
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:44,000
and your bad cholesterol
is shockingly bad.

530
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:47,124
- Tell ya to lay off
those pork rinds, Pooh Bear.
- Yeah, pork rind this.

531
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:50,483
<i>Pork rinds this!
Yeah!

532
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,398
Take it off, baby!

533
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:57,326
Well, at least
they're in good spirits.

534
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,996
<i>Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?

535
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:06,766
I won the Westinghouse Prize
when I was 12. Big deal.

536
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:10,681
<i>Published at 19. So what? I got
a double doctorate from M.I.T. At 22.

537
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:14,003
Chemistry and geology.
I taught at Princeton for 21/2 years.

538
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:18,160
You know, I think this might be
the most uncomfortable room
I've ever been in in my life.

539
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:21,159
Why do I do this? Because the money's
good, the scenery changes...

540
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:23,556
and they let me use
explosives, okay?

541
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:26,286
Okay, you wanna be
all psychological with me, that's fine.

542
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,437
I'll tell you one thing
that really drives me nuts...

543
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:32,275
is people who think that Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

544
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:34,204
Who is Jethro Tull?

545
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:38,365
My favourite dish is haggis...
heart, lungs, liver.

546
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:43,083
You shove that all in a sheep's stomach,
then you boil it.
That'll put some hair on your ass.

547
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:46,443
I am not crazy. I'm just
a little emotional right now, okay?

548
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:49,121
You all throwin' all this stuff
at me, man. Look... get... I mean...

549
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,596
After this is over, could I, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

550
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,844
Okay, Cyclops lady's
startin' to bug me.

551
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,765
- Can you handle it?
- I mean, I can handle what I'm,
you know, I'm gonna do.

552
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:00,678
I can handle that, but I don't know
if I can handle this room.

553
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,598
Woman with large breasts.

554
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,080
- Woman with medium breasts.
- Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

555
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,522
And, uh, this is Harry tellin' me
it's not good enough.

556
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,003
And, uh, this is Harry tellin' me
I can't marry his daughter.
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

557
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:16,806
Just let it out.

558
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:20,283
I suffered a major head injury
when I was in high school.

559
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,557
This one looks like you...
with breasts.

560
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:24,677
Yeah, I can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it.

561
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:30,040
A home run! The Cubs win
the World Series!

562
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:34,884
Fail. Fail.
Depressively fail.

563
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,925
One toxicology analysis
revealed ketamine.

564
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:41,761
- That is a very powerful sedative.
- Sedatives are used
all the time, Doctor.

565
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,758
Well, this one's used on horses.

566
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,198
Some of these guys
are pretty big.

567
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,602
It would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare...

568
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:52,081
prescreen viable subjects
for space travel.

569
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:57,241
- We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.
- Can they physically survive the trip?

570
00:36:57,287 --> 00:37:02,156
- That's all I need to know here, okay?
- Personally, I don't know how
they survived the tests.

571
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:08,878
Talk about the wrong stuff.

572
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,963
Good morning.
I'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

573
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:17,686
In addition to flying one of
the X-71 teams to that rock...

574
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:21,760
my job is to train you how to deal
with the mental and physical
rigors of working in space...

575
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:25,277
so you don't freak out
on the asteroid.

576
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:28,677
United States astronauts
train for years.

577
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,598
You have 12 days.

578
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,962
Do we have any intelligent questions
before we get started?

579
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:38,725
- What's an X-71?
- You're the first civilians
to ever see her.

580
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,083
We call 'em the X-71 s.

581
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:44,635
It's a top secret joint venture
with the Air Force.

582
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:47,599
She and her sister ship at Vandenberg
are leaving tomorrow
for launch prep in Florida...

583
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:49,245
but I thought
you oughta take a look.

584
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,285
The two shuttles going up are
the <i>Freedom</i> and the <i>Independence.</i>

585
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:55,603
Her titanium alloy impenetrable skin
covers the toughest, meanest...

586
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:58,599
most sophisticated space vehicle
man has ever made.

587
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,042
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker...

588
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:02,958
will command the shuttle
<i>Independence.</i>

589
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,562
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle <i>Freedom.</i>

590
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:10,759
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordnance.

591
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:13,998
Anyway, uh, I just thought, uh...

592
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,157
thought you guys should meet.

593
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:22,442
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

594
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:32,365
So we're going swimming on this
asteroid? Is that what this is for?

595
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:36,235
Here at downtown NASA,
we call this the "Monster Armadillo."

596
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:40,559
Gonna be retrofitted
with your drilling arm. She'll turn
800 turbo horses in near zero gravity.

597
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:44,481
Mind if we take a look at her now?
All these rubber hoses gotta go, Max.
Count 'em up.

598
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,525
Make sure it's
short-throw shiftin'.

599
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:51,037
Quincy!
Somebody tell me what this is.

600
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:55,040
<i>Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400?

601
00:38:55,087 --> 00:38:59,842
This is about the sorriest group
of people I've seen in all
my entire military career.

602
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:02,799
Your space flight's gonna be
a brutal assault on your senses.

603
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:07,039
I'm here to give you a taste
of that. NASA's got some of
the finest pilots in the world.

604
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:10,079
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes
into the back of your heads.

605
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,927
Go easy on me, okay?
It's my first time.

606
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:16,800
I just wanna seriously say
I have a small fear of flying.

607
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:20,718
I'm gonna twist ya.

608
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:26,237
- And I'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?

609
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:29,916
Frap your body
till your bones hurt.

610
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,879
When you squeal, I'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

611
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:36,482
No, take me down!

612
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:40,161
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh...

613
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:42,721
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

614
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,242
Don't forget:
We gotta X-ray all these...

615
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:50,524
- If you had to say, who would you say?
- I don't know, Oscar.
Who do you think you are?

616
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,923
- Han Solo.
- No. If anybody's anybody, I'm Han.

617
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,838
And you're...
you're Chewbacca.

618
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,646
Chewie? Have you even
seen <i>Star Wars?</i>

619
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:01,116
All right, men, let's go.
Step it up.

620
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:09,720
Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

621
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,839
He's bouncing because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

622
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:16,442
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

623
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:18,955
Something gets launched off
that asteroid with enough force...

624
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:21,322
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

625
00:40:21,407 --> 00:40:24,956
What is the deal?
Is it just me, or is Watts really hot?

626
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,884
Yeah.

627
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:30,636
So we have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

628
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:32,558
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

629
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,239
- Bear!
- Yes?

630
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:37,285
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

631
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:41,206
'Cause I'm trying to describe
to you how these D.A.T. S
keep your ass on the ground...

632
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:43,437
so that if I were to kick you
in the balls...

633
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,166
and you don't know how to work them,
what happens to you?

634
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,681
- I float away.
- Yeah.

635
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:51,520
And, uh, when do we
start training for that?

636
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:53,916
Gentlemen, I'll give you 30 seconds
to put your helmets on...

637
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,197
then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum...

638
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,562
and you will know what it's like
to be in space.

639
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:00,199
Go!

640
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:03,518
Depressed in 30 seconds.

641
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:05,598
Main valves have been activated.

642
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:08,878
Vacuum P.S.I. S are open.

643
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:25,318
Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

644
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:28,046
Now, let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. I know this is not to scale.

645
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:33,042
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

646
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:34,958
Now, 67 minutes later...

647
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:39,245
you're gonna dock with the Russian space
station to meet cosmonaut Andropov...

648
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:42,239
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

649
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:44,801
That's your fuel.
Then you'll release...

650
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:47,560
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

651
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:51,322
Now, we only have one shot
of landing on this rock...

652
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:55,042
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

653
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:57,925
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters...

654
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,283
slingshotting you
around the moon...

655
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:03,676
coming up behind the asteroid.

656
00:42:03,727 --> 00:42:06,878
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.

657
00:42:06,967 --> 00:42:10,243
It's where the, uh, the coyote
sat his ass down in a slingshot...

658
00:42:10,287 --> 00:42:12,164
then he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

659
00:42:12,207 --> 00:42:15,040
- Is-Is that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

660
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:17,925
- No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.
- Hey, Rock.

661
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:22,245
- Remember that one?
- Well, actually, we have a lot better
rockets than the coyote.

662
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:28,000
Now, when you've finished
your Road Runner thrust move...

663
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,762
you'll be moving
at 22,500 miles per hour.

664
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:34,486
Coming around behind the asteroid,
where we're hoping...

665
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:36,842
that the tail debris'll be
cleared by the moon's gravity.

666
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,043
And you'll land right here.
That's it.

667
00:42:39,127 --> 00:42:43,279
We got separate landing sites
for each team. Softest parts
of the rock as we can figure.

668
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,996
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

669
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,641
First team
that hits 800 feet wins.

670
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,606
Now this rock is big, it's dense, it's
got some gravity. You can walk around.

671
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:56,081
But use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

672
00:42:56,167 --> 00:43:00,160
Okay, Mr Truman, let's say that
we actually do land on this.

673
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:02,243
What's it gonna be like
up there?

674
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:05,444
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

675
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:10,163
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

676
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:13,319
Unexpected eruptions.
Things like that.

677
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:16,558
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

678
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:18,558
That's all you gotta say:
Scariest environment imaginable.

679
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:22,077
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke, and you leave.

680
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:26,757
Now, here's the key: You're gonna
remote detonate the bomb...

681
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,045
before the asteroid
passes this plane... Zero Barrier.

682
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:34,756
You do that, and the remaining
pieces of rock...

683
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:37,964
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

684
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:40,481
Now, if the bomb explodes
after Zero Barrier...

685
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:45,236
game's over.

686
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:47,642
<i>Paul, this is Houston.
Fire your rockets.

687
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:52,157
- Okay, your rockets are maximum.
Beautiful boost.
- Oscar!

688
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:54,437
Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

689
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:57,200
- Have you seen Grace?
- Yeah, she's over in the hangar
with A.J.

690
00:43:57,287 --> 00:44:00,324
Harry, wait a second. Did you say Grace?
Okay, I thought you said Bear.

691
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:38,318
Will you marry me?

692
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,518
Grace is old enough
to vote, Harry.

693
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,485
She's old enough to have a drink or
get married if she wants, get a divorce.

694
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,564
Let me tell you something, fellas. When
I get back, when we get this job done...

695
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:01,478
I will deal with this
in my own way.

696
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,637
Come on, Harry. It's not like
I'm rootin' for A.J. Here.

697
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:05,917
- I'm just sayin',
Grace is not a little girl any more.
- Hey, Rock, you know, wait a minute.

698
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:09,397
Let me get a pencil and
a piece of paper. I wanna jot down
all your pearls of wisdom here.

699
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:12,803
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While we're
off trottin' the globe, hunting mud...

700
00:45:12,887 --> 00:45:15,526
Gracie grew up to become
a full-blown hottie, you know?

701
00:45:15,567 --> 00:45:18,001
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is...
- She's a babe.

702
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:21,557
Max, Max, okay. You're talkin'
about my little girl, all right?

703
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:23,837
I think I know
who and what she is, okay?

704
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,641
Okay, but Harry, all we're sayin' is,
we're talkin' about a kid who's
comin' into her own right now.

705
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:32,203
And she's gettin' curious about her body
and she's exploring her sexuality.
And you know what?

706
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,403
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

707
00:45:34,487 --> 00:45:37,923
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should I listen to you?

708
00:45:38,007 --> 00:45:41,920
And I know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just, you
know, a thousand different directions.

709
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:45,482
- You don't know which end is up.
- Yo, Harry, no disrespect, man,
but we all helped to raise her.

710
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:49,765
- So, in part, we all feel
like a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.

711
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:54,562
I'll be damned if I worked all
these years so my little girl
can marry a roughneck.

712
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,041
She's better than that.

713
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:01,357
Better than all of us.

714
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:12,321
Harry, just sit back, relax.
I'm gonna put on a little
free Armadillo driving clinic for ya.

715
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,483
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

716
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:26,200
Two shuttle teams. A.J.'ll be
running the drill team with Oscar,
Bear and Noonan on the <i>Independence.</i>

717
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:29,444
I'll run the drill team on <i>Freedom</i>
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

718
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:32,081
Once we land, we'll have
eight hours to get the job done.

719
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:36,080
In order to split this rock
on the fault line,
we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

720
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:40,365
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.

721
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:44,524
Come on, <i>Independence.</i> Keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.

722
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:47,679
We're the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

723
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:50,565
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna
trick 'em up. My computer
will simulate a gas pocket...

724
00:46:50,647 --> 00:46:54,879
at 625 feet and then
hard iron ferrite at 635.

725
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:58,596
I'm gonna draw up some more O2 in.
We're takin' her up.

726
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:01,281
- I'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

727
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:03,841
Clamp it down. Watch your time,
<i>Independence</i> team.

728
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:05,918
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

729
00:47:05,967 --> 00:47:08,037
You're gonna blow the tranny, A.J.
Slow it down, baby.

730
00:47:08,127 --> 00:47:10,482
Take it easy, Bear.
Just relax. She can handle it.

731
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:15,561
A.J., you're at 600 feet.
Your pipe is long.
Let's back the R.P.M. S down to 8,000.

732
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:18,400
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

733
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,682
You're gonna snap the pipe.
I don't wanna blow this transmission.

734
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:22,803
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

735
00:47:22,887 --> 00:47:25,924
Bear, come on.
Get on our team for a little bit.

736
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:29,443
- Whoa, space cowboy.
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, I'm listenin', Bear.

737
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,597
Harry? You don't work for Harry
any more, okay?

738
00:47:31,687 --> 00:47:34,406
Out there you gotta listen to me.
When we're on that rock,
you gotta do what I say.

739
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:37,445
Now send more to the turbine.
I'm throttling up to 11,000.

740
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:39,995
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.

741
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:42,885
Hey, Harry, would you let me
run my team, please?

742
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:45,361
- R.P.M. S are at red line.
- Bear, goddam it, I know what I'm doing.

743
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:47,961
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

744
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:51,079
- A.J., back the R...
- Transmission overload.
- Number one transmission is down.

745
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:54,955
Oh, son of a... The computer's wrong,
and you know that.

746
00:47:55,047 --> 00:47:58,244
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

747
00:47:58,287 --> 00:48:01,199
If you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

748
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:04,324
I'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.

749
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,766
- You wanna go home?
Is that it? You wanna be fired?
- No, I don't.

750
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:12,963
- My crew was doing the right thing.
- Your crew?

751
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:15,680
- Yeah.
- Your crew just blew
the transmission, A. J!

752
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:19,766
Listen, that NASA computer is just
playin' it safe. The machine you built,
the rig, could do it.

753
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:21,917
Shut up. Just shut up!
Shut your mouth!

754
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:25,846
Those men in that room
have zero tolerance
for showin' off, hot doggin'...

755
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:29,761
goin' by your gut instinct or
you tryin' to be a hero, you got that?

756
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:32,077
- Say the words, A. J!
- I got it!

757
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,045
- I want my men to have
tomorrow night off.
- What do you mean "off"?

758
00:48:35,087 --> 00:48:38,796
I mean, off. Out of here. For at least
ten hours. Then we'll go to Kennedy.

759
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:43,119
Well, there's no possible way we can
do that, Harry. There's a potentially
huge security risk. What if they talk?

760
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:46,165
- What if they get hurt?
- What if they're too burned out
to do the right thing?

761
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:48,636
What if they get up there,
and they forget what
they're fighting for?

762
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:51,201
You see what's goin' on up there.
These boys are ready to snap.

763
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:53,397
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.

764
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,961
For all we know, tomorrow night could be
the last night they ever see Earth.

765
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:58,157
I don't think it's too much to ask to
let 'em spend it with their families.

766
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:00,636
- Well, listen, there's
no possible way we can do that.
- You got family, Colonel?

767
00:49:00,727 --> 00:49:05,403
- Two girls.
- Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow
night with your little girls?

768
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:08,007
I'm not askin' ya.
I'm tellin' ya.

769
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:10,362
Make this happen.

770
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:21,763
This is a pretty big loan.
Why don't you count the cash?

771
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:23,684
Nah, this looks like
100 grand to me.

772
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,197
I'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
I hope you know what you're doin'...

773
00:49:27,287 --> 00:49:29,437
because I'll bust your head
with a sledgehammer.

774
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:32,047
- You'll get your money back.
- You don't look too healthy.

775
00:49:32,127 --> 00:49:34,516
You're not gonna die on me,
are ya?

776
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:38,560
Let's just say,
no more than you are. Thanks, Vic.

777
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:48,676
<i>Don't wanna close my eyes</i>

778
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:51,327
<i>I don't wanna fall asleep</i>

779
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:53,358
<i>'Cause I'd miss you, baby</i>

780
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:57,281
- <i>And I don't wanna miss a thing</i>
- You know what I was thinkin'?
- What?

781
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:02,756
L-I really don't think that the
animal cracker qualifies as a cracker.

782
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:05,486
- Why?
- Well, 'cause it's sweet,
which to me suggests cookie.

783
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:09,606
And, you know, putting cheese
on something is sort of
the defining characteristic...

784
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:11,922
of what makes a cracker
a cracker.

785
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,838
I don't know why
I thought of that. I just...

786
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,395
Baby, you have
such sweet pillow talk.

787
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:20,685
I got a little animal cracker, Discovery
Channel thing happenin' right here.

788
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:24,476
Watch the gazelle
as he grazes through the open plains.

789
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:30,001
Now look
as the cheetah approaches.

790
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:32,726
Watch
as he stalks his prey.

791
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:35,480
Now, the gazelle's
a little spooked...

792
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:40,078
and he could head north
to the ample sustenance...

793
00:50:40,167 --> 00:50:42,886
provided by
the mountainous peaks above.

794
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:47,524
He could go south.

795
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:52,801
The gazelle now faces man's
most perilous question:

796
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:56,999
North, or...

797
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,203
south?

798
00:50:59,247 --> 00:51:03,365
Way down under.

799
00:51:05,927 --> 00:51:07,758
Tune in next week.

800
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:12,120
Baby...

801
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:14,397
do you think it's possible
that anyone else in the world...

802
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:19,202
is doing this very same thing
at this very same moment?

803
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:21,442
I hope so.

804
00:51:21,527 --> 00:51:24,166
Otherwise, what the hell
are we tryin' to save?

805
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,963
<i>Don't wanna close my eyes</i>

806
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:37,438
<i>I don't wanna fall asleep</i>
<i>'cause I'd miss you, baby</i>

807
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:41,042
<i>And I don't wanna miss a thing</i>

808
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:47,602
Hey.

809
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:53,803
- What are you doing here?
- I was just passin' by on the, uh...

810
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:55,878
I came...

811
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:03,920
- Who's he?
- That man's a salesman.

812
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:06,077
Would you go inside?

813
00:52:09,647 --> 00:52:12,002
Thank you.

814
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,677
He got big.

815
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,799
You can't come around like this.

816
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:24,323
The court says you can't.
It confuses him.

817
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:27,086
No, I know. I just...

818
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:31,365
I wanted to say
that I'm sorry...

819
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:35,201
about everything, and...

820
00:52:35,287 --> 00:52:37,482
I got somethin' comin' up.

821
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:41,924
It's something kinda big.
You just might be proud of me.

822
00:52:42,007 --> 00:52:44,999
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?

823
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:48,966
You don't have to... You don't have to
tell him who it's from. Just...

824
00:52:56,647 --> 00:52:59,036
<i>Everybody talkin'about</i>
<i>what it is, what it ain't</i>

825
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:01,123
<i>Kiss on the devil</i>
<i>and you piss off a saint</i>

826
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:03,801
<i>But it can't be love</i>
<i>if you don't have to crawl</i>

827
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,884
<i>You say you don't need nothin'</i>
<i>but you got to have it all</i>

828
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:10,403
- Come back here!
- Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?

829
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:12,677
- Yeah.
- We gotta put
these girls through college.

830
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:16,555
- I love this astronaut stuff.
- All right!
- Good work if you can get it.

831
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:19,115
Yeah, I'm just in town doin'
a little astronaut training.

832
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:21,767
Ooh! <i>Astronauta.</i>

833
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:24,156
Ah, <i>si.</i>
I'm a mission specialist.

834
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:27,557
- Yes, and what's that mean?
- I don't know.

835
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:33,357
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you guys are?

836
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:37,804
- You're hoggin' all the action.
- Hey, pinhead. Why don't you
go find your own party?

837
00:53:37,887 --> 00:53:41,163
- Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?
- Here. Why don't you go
buy yourself a neck?

838
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,841
Hey, Mr Clean!

839
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:48,429
- Man! Call NASA!
- Get over there.

840
00:53:48,474 --> 00:53:50,271
- They'll confirm it! We're astronauts!
- Yeah, yeah.

841
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,589
- Yeah, we're astronauts.
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.

842
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:55,108
You are so messing with national
security right now, man.

843
00:53:55,154 --> 00:53:56,872
- Turn around.
- You are fired tomorrow morning.

844
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:59,627
I'm telling ya.
I'll get the CIA and the FBI.

845
00:53:59,674 --> 00:54:03,587
- You'll be working security at Toys
'R' Us. Oh, oh, baby. No, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.

846
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:05,147
- Oh, it's time to go now.
- Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no.

847
00:54:05,234 --> 00:54:07,384
- You see, I'm goin' into space,
and I'm not comin' back.
- No, no, no.

848
00:54:11,674 --> 00:54:15,462
- It's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!
- Give me a projected impact.

849
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:17,550
- East Asia, 11 minutes.
- We're gonna have to warn...

850
00:54:17,594 --> 00:54:20,108
Warn who?
The entire South Pacific?

851
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,908
So the whole world knows.

852
00:55:15,474 --> 00:55:18,671
Tell me you've never let
anybody down before.

853
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:21,786
I never quit yet.
How's that?

854
00:55:21,874 --> 00:55:24,832
I guess that'll have to do.

855
00:55:24,914 --> 00:55:27,223
You know somethin'?

856
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:29,669
I still remember the first,
middle and last name...

857
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:33,229
of every guy that qualified
for the astronaut programme
the first year I was here.

858
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:37,233
Thanks. I went
into the engineering programme.

859
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:40,983
Kinda had to.
But, boy, I wanted to go up there.

860
00:55:41,074 --> 00:55:44,384
I wanted to be one of those guys
with a mission patch on my arm.

861
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:48,384
I tell you, I'd be on that shuttle
with you, Harry, if I could.

862
00:55:52,714 --> 00:55:55,274
You don't want to be up in that shuttle
any more than I do.

863
00:55:57,794 --> 00:55:59,546
Well, good luck in Florida tomorrow.

864
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:03,547
The death of 50,000 people in Shanghai
yesterday has rattled the na...

865
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,666
A French satellite has tracked
an object in space...

866
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:09,274
Sources are estimating
that the tidal wave was five...

867
00:56:09,354 --> 00:56:11,185
This is CNN, live in Florida.

868
00:56:11,274 --> 00:56:14,505
We have just learned that NASA
is on a full-scale military alert.

869
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:17,062
They're calling this
a global killer.

870
00:56:17,114 --> 00:56:19,309
The government has been
very tight-lipped throughout this...

871
00:56:19,394 --> 00:56:21,350
The Pentagon is getting involved
at this point with some kind...

872
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:24,750
of a project involving NASA
and perhaps a shuttle mission...

873
00:56:24,794 --> 00:56:27,149
Senior Pentagon officials
refused comment...

874
00:56:27,234 --> 00:56:31,466
adding fuel to the speculation that
there could be a very serious problem.

875
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,263
We have a special team of astronauts
that arrived in Florida this evening.

876
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:37,225
NASA's in emergency launch
preparation...

877
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:40,545
in cooperation with Russian, Japanese
and French space agencies...

878
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:43,427
on the most massive
joint space venture in history.

879
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:54,354
Gracie?

880
00:57:02,194 --> 00:57:04,071
Got your note.

881
00:57:04,914 --> 00:57:08,065
- What are you doing out here, honey?
- Um, just thinkin'.

882
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:12,067
- Yeah.
- I, um, want to apologize to you for...

883
00:57:12,114 --> 00:57:15,186
Oh, no, Grace. Stop.
You don't have to apologize at all. L...

884
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:16,548
I sh...

885
00:57:18,514 --> 00:57:22,223
I shouldn't have dragged you around
on all those oil rigs. I just...

886
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,863
I don't think that I did
the right thing with you.

887
00:57:25,914 --> 00:57:27,142
- You're wrong.
- You see...

888
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,310
I love my life.

889
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,510
I love everything
about my life...

890
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:34,392
and I don't blame you
for my mother leaving.

891
00:57:36,594 --> 00:57:38,232
She left us both.

892
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:41,903
And-And I love you.

893
00:57:41,994 --> 00:57:45,225
And don't talk
like you're not comin' back.

894
00:57:46,074 --> 00:57:48,065
<i>Promise me that you'll come back.

895
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:52,267
- Okay.
- Say, "I promise."

896
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:55,472
I promise, Grace.

897
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,902
It's gonna be all right, Grace.

898
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:10,703
If it's not too much trouble, can you
please bring my fiancé home with you?

899
00:58:10,794 --> 00:58:12,466
Oh, Jesus.

900
00:58:22,354 --> 00:58:23,833
The president will be
addressing the nation...

901
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:25,870
and all of you personally
within the hour.

902
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:55,103
Astronauts.

903
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,151
I'll see you
in a couple days, honey.

904
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:12,423
<i>All my bags are packed</i>

905
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:15,307
<i>I'm ready to go</i>

906
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:19,632
<i>I'm standing here</i>
<i>outside your door</i>

907
00:59:19,674 --> 00:59:22,507
<i>I hate to wake you up</i>

908
00:59:22,554 --> 00:59:24,943
<i>To say goodbye</i>

909
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:29,232
<i>So kiss me and smile for me</i>

910
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,152
<i>Let me know you'll wait for me</i>

911
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:36,830
<i>Hold me like</i>
<i>you'll never let me go</i>

912
00:59:36,914 --> 00:59:39,986
<i>'Cause I'm leavin'</i>

913
00:59:40,074 --> 00:59:42,429
<i>On a jet plane</i>

914
00:59:42,514 --> 00:59:44,709
<i>Don't know</i>
<i>when I'll be back again</i>

915
00:59:44,754 --> 00:59:49,145
<i>Leavin'on a jet plane</i>

916
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:52,510
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>when I'll be back again</i>

917
00:59:52,594 --> 00:59:56,030
<i>- Leavin'on a jet plane</i>
<i>- Leavin'on a jet plane</i>

918
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:59,390
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>when I'll be back again</i>

919
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:04,423
<i>- Leavin'on a jet plane</i>
- So, Truman, this is who you found
to save the planet.

920
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:06,704
- <i>Don't know when I'll be back again</i>
- Frost, you good to go?

921
01:00:06,794 --> 01:00:09,706
- Mm-hmm. One-One sec.
<i>- Leavin'on a jet plane</i>
- That boy don't take anything seriously.

922
01:00:09,754 --> 01:00:13,303
- Yeah. Reminds me of
a guy I used to know.
- <i>Don't know when I'll be back again</i>

923
01:00:13,394 --> 01:00:16,864
<i>Leavin'on a jet plane</i>

924
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,587
<i>- I don't know when I'll be back again</i>
- I'm marrying you.

925
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:23,707
- Bet your ass you are.
- <i>Leavin'on a jet plane</i>

926
01:00:23,794 --> 01:00:26,388
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>when I'll be back again</i>

927
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:43,783
I address you tonight...

928
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,832
not as the president
of the United States...

929
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:50,828
not as the leader of a country...

930
01:00:50,874 --> 01:00:54,344
but as a citizen of humanity.

931
01:00:56,074 --> 01:00:59,623
We are faced with the very gravest
of challenges.

932
01:01:00,754 --> 01:01:05,464
The Bible calls this day Armageddon,
the end of all things.

933
01:01:06,634 --> 01:01:10,866
And yet,
for the first time...

934
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:15,470
in the history of the planet,
a species has the technology...

935
01:01:15,554 --> 01:01:18,910
to prevent its own extinction.

936
01:01:18,994 --> 01:01:22,828
All of you praying with us
need to know...

937
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:26,987
that everything that can be done
to prevent this disaster...

938
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:29,502
is being called into service.

939
01:01:31,794 --> 01:01:35,309
The human thirst for excellence...

940
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,748
and knowledge...

941
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:42,952
every step
up the ladder of science...

942
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:46,953
every adventurous
reach into space...

943
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:50,953
all of our combined
modern technologies and imaginations...

944
01:01:50,994 --> 01:01:54,782
even the wars that we've fought,
have provided us the tools...

945
01:01:54,834 --> 01:01:57,189
to wage this terrible battle.

946
01:01:58,474 --> 01:02:00,863
Through all the chaos
that is our history...

947
01:02:00,914 --> 01:02:03,826
through all of the wrongs
and the discord...

948
01:02:03,914 --> 01:02:05,711
through all of the pain
and suffering...

949
01:02:05,794 --> 01:02:10,345
through all of our times
there is one thing...

950
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,033
- that has nourished our souls...
- Mom, that salesman's on TV.

951
01:02:13,074 --> 01:02:15,713
And elevated our species
above its origins...

952
01:02:15,794 --> 01:02:17,989
and that is our courage.

953
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:21,185
The dreams of an entire planet
are focused tonight...

954
01:02:21,234 --> 01:02:24,670
on those 14 brave souls...

955
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:26,870
travelling into the heavens.

956
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:30,230
That man's not a salesman.
That's your daddy.

957
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:34,671
And may we all, citizens the world over,
see these events through.

958
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:39,269
Godspeed and good luck to you.

959
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:48,947
<i>Freedom</i> crew.
<i>Independence</i> crew.

960
01:02:53,514 --> 01:02:56,790
- How you feelin'?
- Uh, good, you know.

961
01:02:56,874 --> 01:03:00,913
I mean, considering I've never been this
scared in my entire life. L... You know...

962
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:04,629
Listen, once you get up there,
you're gonna be on your own.

963
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,591
If anything should happen,
I just wanted...

964
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:10,064
I know, Harry. I'll, uh,
try not to disappoint you.

965
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,388
Take care of yourself, kid.

966
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:22,989
Freedom's <i>on the bridge.</i>

967
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:27,664
<i>Attention in the firing room.</i>
<i>The oxidizer loading is complete.</i>

968
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:31,030
- Independence <i>on the bridge.</i>
- <i>Attention all personnel.</i>

969
01:03:31,114 --> 01:03:33,947
<i>We are Tminus two hours</i>
<i>to the programme goal.</i>

970
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:44,470
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?

971
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:47,705
You know, we're sittin' on four million
pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon...

972
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:50,672
and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts...

973
01:03:50,754 --> 01:03:52,904
built by the lowest bidder.

974
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:57,146
- Makes you feel good, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:59,074 --> 01:04:01,588
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.

976
01:04:01,674 --> 01:04:03,904
- Yeah?
- I got that excited, scared feelin'...

977
01:04:03,954 --> 01:04:06,991
like 98% excited, 2% scared.

978
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:10,913
Maybe it's more. It could be 2... It
could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.

979
01:04:10,994 --> 01:04:16,512
But that's what makes it
so intense, is it's so confused.
I can't really figure it out.

980
01:04:16,594 --> 01:04:18,903
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause I don't want to fall out.

981
01:04:18,994 --> 01:04:22,225
- Yes, sir.
- I mean, almost to the point
of cutting off circulation.

982
01:04:22,314 --> 01:04:25,704
- Ow.
- It must be a comfort to know...

983
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:29,230
that if the space programme
goes under you can always get a job
at Helga's House of Pain, huh?

984
01:04:29,394 --> 01:04:32,591
- All right. Flight directors on
with the go/ no-go for launch.
- Retro.

985
01:04:32,674 --> 01:04:34,505
- Go flight.

- CAPCOM <i>Independence.</i>
- Go flight.

989
01:04:42,954 --> 01:04:46,264
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's pucker time.

990
01:04:46,354 --> 01:04:50,347
Independence <i>and</i> Freedom,
<i>this is Kennedy firing room.</i>
<i>We're Tminus one minute.</i>

991
01:04:50,394 --> 01:04:54,103
All crew members,
close and lock your visors.

992
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:57,664
Independence, <i>this is launch control.</i>
<i>Be advised, we're in a smooth count.</i>

993
01:04:57,714 --> 01:05:00,672
T minus 31. You're go
for auto-sequence start.

994
01:05:00,754 --> 01:05:03,632
<i>B.L. T. S, perform</i>
<i>your A.D.U. Pre-start.</i>

995
01:05:03,714 --> 01:05:08,424
<i>Okay, gentlemen, you're our warriors</i>
<i>up there. God be with you.</i>

996
01:05:08,514 --> 01:05:12,951
<i>- You're already heroes.</i>
<i>Just sit back and enjoy the ride.</i>
<i>- F. T.D., we're clear to launch.</i>

997
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,343
We're T minus 20 seconds.

998
01:05:17,554 --> 01:05:21,593
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

999
01:05:22,834 --> 01:05:25,553
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

1000
01:05:25,594 --> 01:05:27,869
<i>We have main engine start.</i>

1001
01:05:29,794 --> 01:05:33,548
- <i>We have booster ignition.</i>
- We're going.

1002
01:05:33,634 --> 01:05:35,829
<i>And liftoff.</i>

1003
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:47,105
Freedom, <i>this is flight deck.</i>

1004
01:05:47,154 --> 01:05:48,985
<i>Roger,</i> Freedom.
<i>You're looking good.</i>

1005
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:06,144
- We have go for <i>Independence.</i>
<i>- Three, two, one.</i>

1006
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:10,346
- Independence, <i>we have booster ignition.</i>
<i>- We have liftoff.</i>

1007
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,789
We are cooking, Houston.

1008
01:06:33,434 --> 01:06:35,789
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.

1009
01:06:39,274 --> 01:06:42,186
- Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.
- All engines are go.

1010
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:45,391
Keep a sharp eye out on both of'em.

1011
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:53,383
Start roll manoeuvre.

1012
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:06,191
- Two good roll programs.
- One down.
- <i>Independence,</i> we have a max cue.

1013
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:08,111
Roger, Control.
We are a max cue.

1014
01:07:10,114 --> 01:07:12,423
S.R.B. Sep...

1015
01:07:16,434 --> 01:07:19,631
- We are single-engine, press, demi-go.
- <i>Copy, press, demi-go.</i>

1016
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:21,790
Houston, this is a kick-ass ride!

1017
01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:31,310
Freedom, <i>this is Houston.</i>
<i>Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.</i>

1018
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:42,264
Freedom, <i>stats are good.</i>

1019
01:07:46,514 --> 01:07:49,551
- Independence,
<i>telemetry is up and running...</i>
- Oh, my God!

1020
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:53,143
This is space! 'Course, we're just
in the beginning part of space.

1021
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:55,623
We-We haven't even gotten
to outer space yet.

1022
01:07:55,674 --> 01:07:58,905
Roger, Houston.
We have a visual on the Russian
space station. Initiating retro burn.

1023
01:08:01,394 --> 01:08:04,909
Gentlemen, remember the Russian space
station has been up there for 11 years.

1024
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:06,985
<i>Most of us</i>
<i>don't have cars that old.</i>

1025
01:08:07,034 --> 01:08:11,073
<i>Now, the cosmonaut on board has been</i>
<i>on that tin can for 18 months, alone.</i>

1026
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:16,229
<i>So don't be surprised</i>
<i>if he's a little off.</i>

1027
01:08:16,274 --> 01:08:20,665
- Independence, <i>we're gonna put you...</i>
- All right, crew.
Let's exit these flight suits.

1028
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:26,585
Hello. This is Russian
space station. Can you hear me?

1029
01:08:27,954 --> 01:08:29,865
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.

1030
01:08:29,954 --> 01:08:33,310
I'm ready to fire
my thrusters any time.

1031
01:08:33,394 --> 01:08:36,704
- <i>Stand by.</i>
- Okay. I'm not going anywhere.

1032
01:08:36,754 --> 01:08:39,826
<i>We have a go.</i>
<i>Initiate gravitational spin.</i>

1033
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:49,311
<i>You are maxed at 40% spin.</i>

1034
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:53,393
Okay, Houston.

1035
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:57,706
I can feel I'm having gravity.

1036
01:08:57,794 --> 01:09:00,592
All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna dock in a minute.

1037
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:04,786
Now, the Russian space station has
fired her rockets to simulate gravity
and let us work faster.

1038
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,990
But it's gonna make you queasy,
so prepare yourself.

1039
01:09:07,034 --> 01:09:11,312
Well, it's about time.
I haven't thrown up in about an hour.

1040
01:09:14,514 --> 01:09:17,426
<i>Initiating first phase</i>
<i>of docking procedure.</i>

1041
01:09:17,514 --> 01:09:20,472
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.

1042
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:30,311
<i>One foot per second.</i>
<i>Let's take this slow and</i>
<i>do it right, folks. Twenty feet.</i>

1043
01:09:33,474 --> 01:09:37,353
Ten feet. Looking good on radar.

1044
01:09:37,394 --> 01:09:39,749
Five feet.

1045
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:46,189
Locks are engaged.
Fuel teams, let's go.

1046
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:50,511
Freedom, <i>telemetry is looking good.</i>

1047
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:54,832
- We have soft dock.
- Fuel teams, prepare to unload.

1048
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:02,105
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.
Let's go, <i>Independence.</i>

1049
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:07,306
Colonel.

1050
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:20,110
Where is he? Anybody home?

1051
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:22,793
Welcome, everybody!

1052
01:10:24,434 --> 01:10:28,427
I am not gas station.
This is sophisticated laboratory.

1053
01:10:28,514 --> 01:10:32,268
I'm in charge.
So do not be touching anything.

1054
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:34,663
I need one... I need you.

1055
01:10:34,714 --> 01:10:37,592
- Go with him.
- I need you. Hurry up.
Hurry up. Come on. Come on.

1056
01:10:37,674 --> 01:10:42,145
It's very important you watch the
fuel gauge, okay? Put on cold suit.

1057
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:45,231
- <i>Countdown clock will hold at...</i>
- <i>Copy that, Houston.</i>
<i>Prepping for fuel transfer.</i>

1058
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,947
<i>Countdown clock will hold</i>
<i>at Tminus 20 minutes and...</i>

1059
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,748
- Fuel pod is down there.
- It's down here, huh? Great.

1060
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,707
Let's go. Move it on.
Here we go. We go. We go.

1061
01:10:56,754 --> 01:10:59,348
Bring it down. Bring it down.

1062
01:11:02,114 --> 01:11:04,867
Okay, let's connect
these fuel lines.

1063
01:11:06,354 --> 01:11:09,551
<i>Freedom</i> on the left,
<i>Independence</i> on the right.

1064
01:11:09,634 --> 01:11:12,102
All right. We're goin' left here.

1065
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:17,706
To the right is fuel gauge.
You watch the fuel gauge. 150, okay.

1066
01:11:17,754 --> 01:11:22,953
160, okay. 200, bad disaster
for space station.

1067
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:28,068
So if you watch 200,
you can call for Lev, on,
and you see here number one, on.

1068
01:11:28,114 --> 01:11:30,787
You ask for Lev. And you pull
this down, all the way down.

1069
01:11:30,834 --> 01:11:35,624
- What's Lev?
- I am Lev Andropov,
colonel of Russian space agency.

1070
01:11:35,674 --> 01:11:39,269
In Russia I'm a very big man.

1071
01:11:39,314 --> 01:11:41,987
- We're ready to transfer.
- I'm coming. No problem.

1072
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:46,910
You. You. You there!

1073
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:50,702
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!

1074
01:11:58,874 --> 01:12:00,910
<i>Fuel is pumping.</i>

1075
01:12:04,394 --> 01:12:08,546
Hey, Lev, the, uh, the-the pressure's
climbing. Is there a problem here?

1076
01:12:08,594 --> 01:12:10,789
Houston, we're on
fuel transference.

1077
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:14,952
Don't touch my uncle. You know?
He's a genius of my family.

1078
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:19,707
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys.

1079
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:22,308
He used to work
for a big bomb factory.

1080
01:12:22,354 --> 01:12:26,267
He used to make the tip of the bomb,
the thing that finds, uh...

1081
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,868
New York or Washington, you know?

1082
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:32,270
- Ooh.
- Check your hoses.
We got some thermal variation.

1083
01:12:32,354 --> 01:12:35,744
Stamper, let's look at the couplings
back on the shuttle.

1084
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:40,027
Okay. Shut down. Uh...

1085
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:49,552
- Guys!
- Hold on a second.
- What's that noise?

1086
01:12:51,554 --> 01:12:54,352
Oh, no! God!

1087
01:12:56,754 --> 01:13:00,429
- What is it?
- Leak! Leak! Leak!

1088
01:13:02,314 --> 01:13:06,307
Get your men
back to the shuttle! Go!

1089
01:13:06,354 --> 01:13:09,505
Go on! Hurry up!
Get out of there!

1090
01:13:09,554 --> 01:13:11,624
Now there's really sparks!

1091
01:13:11,674 --> 01:13:15,587
- Pull lever!
- This is the lever!

1092
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:19,309
- Colonel, we must get him out of there!
- A.J., come on out!

1093
01:13:22,634 --> 01:13:25,023
Hurry! Hurry!

1094
01:13:26,954 --> 01:13:29,229
Emergency! Break away!

1095
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:32,112
We got a fire
in the fuel pod!

1096
01:13:34,474 --> 01:13:38,353
- Come on!
- Come on! Get in here!
A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!

1097
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:43,949
- We're losing it!
- Come on out of there!

1098
01:13:53,274 --> 01:13:57,153
Control, this is <i>Independence.</i>
I am seeing vibration...

1099
01:13:58,554 --> 01:14:01,432
- Malloy, talk to me!
- Not good. We got sparks
and fire in the fuel pod.

1100
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:05,393
<i>- Independence,</i> blow those locks
and get outta there now!
- Dump the hoses now! We're going!

1101
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:09,387
- What happened?
Let me shut off the O2 feed!
- Harry, it's burnin' up!

1102
01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:13,746
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here! Get down
there and crack these pipes over here!

1103
01:14:13,834 --> 01:14:17,713
- Harry, no! It's burnin' up!
- We're goin' back for the other team!

1104
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:21,110
Switch on the personnel locators.

1105
01:14:21,194 --> 01:14:23,105
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.

1106
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:25,463
- No!
- Go! Go!

1107
01:14:25,554 --> 01:14:29,866
It's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!

1108
01:14:29,954 --> 01:14:31,546
No!

1109
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:36,754
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! You're gonna die!

1110
01:14:36,834 --> 01:14:39,473
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!
- Open that door and we'll all die!

1111
01:14:39,554 --> 01:14:42,193
- Fuel leak!
- Get out of there!

1112
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:46,468
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!

1113
01:14:48,394 --> 01:14:51,943
Come on back!
No, wait! The door is broken!

1114
01:14:53,274 --> 01:14:56,152
- No!
- They got the fire
sealed in the fuel pod.

1115
01:14:56,234 --> 01:14:58,270
- They locked it down.
<i>- Tracking 'em back to the shuttle.</i>

1116
01:14:58,354 --> 01:15:01,426
They've still got two men
trapped in there!

1117
01:15:01,514 --> 01:15:05,792
Keep running! The shuttle's another
75 feet! Where's the rest of the team?

1118
01:15:05,874 --> 01:15:09,105
- Let's get out of here! The pod...
- Wait, wait, wait! Where's A. J?
- A.J.'s gone!

1119
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:14,188
- We're not leavin' without A. J!
- He's gone! It's too late!

1120
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:16,748
Come on!
This way is our only chance!

1121
01:15:16,794 --> 01:15:19,183
So it's minus 100!

1122
01:15:19,274 --> 01:15:22,346
Very cold. Hold breath,
or lung freezes!

1123
01:15:27,674 --> 01:15:31,553
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!

1124
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:35,593
- Come on!
- Hurry, A. J!
- Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

1125
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:38,546
- I tried! I tried. But A. J...
- It's on fire! It's on fire, Harry!

1126
01:15:38,634 --> 01:15:41,102
- It's them or all of us!
- It's on fire!

1127
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:43,754
- Full thrust.
- We're gonna get hit.

1128
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:03,511
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!

1129
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:05,550
No!

1130
01:16:08,634 --> 01:16:12,183
We're going! It's gonna blow!
