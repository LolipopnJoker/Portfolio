1
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,455
Through the years,
I have been known by many names.

2
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,167
Diablo Gato.

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,379
The Furry Lover.

4
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,548
Chupacabra.

5
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,217
Friskie Two-Times.

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,303
And the Ginger Hit Man.

7
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,766
But to most... I
am Puss In Boots!

8
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,436
Outlaw.

9
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,222
I will never forget you...
Margherita.

10
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,726
I mean, Rosa.

11
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,854
Uh, sorry. I think
maybe I should go.

12
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,193
Hmm.

13
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,433
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

14
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,562
You cannot run forever,

15
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,357
Puss In Boots!

16
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,325
What can I say?
I was a bad Kitty.

17
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,334
Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.

18
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,754
Searching for a way
to clear my name.

19
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,093
And I would get that chance...

20
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,847
on this one fateful night.

21
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,148
Here, Kitty, Kitty!

22
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,737
Raoul. Look what the
cat dragged in.

23
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,281
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

24
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,246
One leche, please.

25
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:14,921
What are you doing here, señor?
Did you lose your ball of yarn?

26
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,177
So funny.

27
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,596
One leche coming up.

28
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,779
I am not looking for trouble.

29
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,955
I am but a humble gato in
search of his next meal.

30
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,291
Perhaps you gentlemen can
help me find a simple score?

31
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:57,254
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble... Puss In Boots.

32
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,893
Well, perhaps if one of
us were to tell the law

33
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,605
that you are in town, we
could split the reward.

34
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,617
You made the cat angry.

35
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,245
You do not want to
make the cat angry!

36
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,041
The Church
of St. Michael has just put up

37
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,669
a Golden statue of the
Virgin of Guadalupe.

38
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,671
I do not steal from churches.

39
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,757
The boys' orphanage has been
donated silver candlesticks,

40
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,551
they would look very
lovely in your home.

41
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,680
- I do not steal from orphans.
- Uh, what about Jack and Jill?

42
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,850
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

43
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,609
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill have
gotten their hands on... magic beans.

44
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,237
Do not joke with me
about magic beans!

45
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,908
I searched half my life for
them. They do not exist.

46
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,245
No, cat. We have seen them.

47
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,458
These... are the
beans of legend.

48
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,877
Huh? Whoa.

49
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,505
Grows a Vine to the
Land of Giants,

50
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,425
and the Golden Goose.

51
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,177
The Golden Goose...

52
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,263
A heist like this could
set you up for life.

53
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,265
All nine of them.

54
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,559
Show him the Golden eggs.

55
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,102
No!

56
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,064
Please, you have shown enough.

57
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:43,110
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

58
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:49,784
The only wish I have is
to repay an old debt.

59
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,952
And this is my chance.

60
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,455
Now...

61
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,625
where do I find
this Jack and Jill?

62
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,945
Huh?

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,621
I'm sorry... we have no rooms.

64
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,087
Well, I think one
just opened up.

65
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,678
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

66
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,223
And don't even think about
skimping on them baby muffins.

67
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,733
We don't have any baby muffins.

68
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,323
You know, Jill...

69
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,200
I been thinking.

70
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,035
Get it out.

71
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,914
I, um... Once we're done with
this magic bean business

72
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,792
and got ourselves all them
beautiful Golden eggs...

73
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,003
Mm-hm, go on.

74
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:27,965
That we cut down on some of
the hijacking and murdering.

75
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,759
I mean, it's fun and
all, but, uh...

76
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,430
I want a baby.

77
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,646
A baby what, Jack?

78
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,231
A baby us, Jill.

79
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,276
We'll raise it wild, like
a squirrel or something.

80
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,030
Holy frijoles!

81
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,032
They do exist.

82
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,242
Ever since you fell down that hill

83
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,620
and broke your crown, you
have been talking crazy.

84
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,628
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

85
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,006
Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

86
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:14,053
Hey! What gives?

87
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,223
If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

88
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,433
No! No! No!

89
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,645
You, you, you! You
stop where you are!

90
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,896
I don't know, Jack.

91
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,565
How do I ride and shoot with
a baby slung on my back?

92
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,319
They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

93
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,113
Those beans are mine!

94
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,366
We fall off
this flat Earth one time.

95
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,034
What better proof of our love...

96
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,994
Me?

97
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,705
You snap me?

98
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,459
You snap me?!

99
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,391
You looking for something?

100
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,314
Uh, no.

101
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,483
No hablo inglﾃｩs.

102
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,652
Whoa, whoa!

103
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,782
You are going to pay for this!

104
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,292
Huh?!

105
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,468
Oh!

106
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,191
No!

107
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,610
Oh!

108
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:58,615
Chupacabra!

109
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,951
Chupacabra! Chupacabra!

110
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,370
- Chupacabra!
- You are a crazy woman!

111
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,588
Ha!

112
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,178
Ha-ha!

113
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,513
Ow!

114
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,594
Those magic beans were my score!

115
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,847
You just cost me a chance at
getting the Golden eggs, Mi amigo.

116
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,808
Put up your Dukes.

117
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,758
Ha!

118
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,556
Yah!

119
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,182
Psst!

120
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,354
Very well.

121
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,356
If it is to be a dance fight,

122
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,776
then I will Tuesday-Night-Dance-Fight
you to the death!

123
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,699
Ha!

124
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,831
Ha!

125
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,176
How dare you do the
Litter Box at me!

126
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,137
Hello!

127
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,269
Toot-toot!

128
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,937
Ha!

129
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,690
Ha-ha! Hmmph!

130
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,740
ﾂ飭 Hey-aa 笙ｪ.

131
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,786
Can you feel me?

132
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,253
Ha-ha!

133
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,428
Yah!

134
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,934
Fear me... if you dare.

135
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,608
Ha!

136
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,135
You hit me in the
head with a guitar?!

137
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,886
You are a woman?

138
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,180
Ohhh!

139
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,433
Whoa.

140
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,020
Amateur.

141
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,107
Wow!

142
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,900
Seﾃｱorita, wait!

143
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,991
Let me buy you some leche! I
am a lover, not a... fighter.

144
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,246
Hello?

145
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:59,291
You are hiding from me?

146
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,044
I like to play the games, too.

147
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:07,257
I sense in you a
kindred spirit, a...

148
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,260
Hmm.

149
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,221
I smell something familiar.

150
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,185
Something... dangerous.

151
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,979
Something...

152
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,814
breakfasty.

153
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,234
It's been a long time, brother.

154
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,823
Maldito huevo.

155
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,158
Ha!

156
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,247
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

157
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,292
How dare you show
your face to me.

158
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,839
I know you're angry.
You have every right.

159
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,092
But it is good to see you, Puss.

160
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,219
Are those new boots?

161
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:56,890
No! They are the same boots I
wore when you betrayed me.

162
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,643
Betrayed you?

163
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,895
You left me cracked in
pieces on a bridge,

164
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,230
surrounded by soldiers!

165
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,731
They wrote a song about it!

166
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,068
And how did we get on that
bridge in the first place?!

167
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,113
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

168
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,447
Humpty!

169
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,702
Remember why we're here.

170
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,204
I should have known.

171
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,457
I had the magic
beans in my grasp,

172
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:27,462
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

173
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,214
You are a curse on my life!

174
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,049
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hear me out.
Okay?

175
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,760
Yes, yes, I sent Kitty
to bring you here.

176
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,096
But she is no ordinary thief.

177
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,558
She's Kitty Softpaws.

178
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,893
The softest touch in Spain.

179
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,021
That's a lot of heel for
a guy, don't you think?

180
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,987
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

181
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,739
we've got a fighting
chance here.

182
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,742
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

183
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,536
the giant's castle and
lived to tell the tale.

184
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,038
You want to survive?
You need a plan.

185
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:07,502
And I've studied this job my
whole life. You know that.

186
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,796
Let's be honest.

187
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,444
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

188
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,886
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

189
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:22,309
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

190
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,021
So what do you say?

191
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,315
Partners?

192
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,987
No. Never again.

193
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,493
I'm sorry, Okay? How long are
you gonna hold a grudge?

194
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,997
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

195
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,501
You need me! And I need you.

196
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,632
Puss! You got any idea what they
do to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

197
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,013
I'll tell you this, my friend.

198
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,557
It ain't over easy.

199
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,143
Ohhh!

200
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,690
Adiﾃｳs... Humpty Dumpty.

201
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,865
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

202
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,076
Don't worry, I'll
take care of it.

203
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,370
I know how to speak meow.

204
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,248
Sad story with
your twisted lies

205
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,334
in your greasy shell that
smells like old ham!

206
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,212
I should crack you open for...

207
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,516
Look what I found.

208
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,562
Someone forgot his money.

209
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,442
Oh, you are dangerous.

210
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,654
Humpty says you like danger.

211
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,494
Just think of all the
trouble we can get into.

212
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,749
The two of us together.

213
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,920
We can steal a lot
of Golden eggs.

214
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,131
Hmm?

215
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,470
And... you owe me.

216
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,557
- I owe you?
- Mm-hm.

217
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,143
You hit me in the
head with a guitar.

218
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,520
I regret the guitar.

219
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,814
Okay, I forgive you.

220
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,191
So... you're in?

221
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:41,740
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

222
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,658
And what is that?

223
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,953
You work for the egg!

224
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,663
Oh, come on, Puss.

225
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:52,167
What happened between you
and Humpty that was so bad?

226
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,172
I am afraid with
me and Humpty...

227
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,258
the scars are too deep.

228
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,933
It all started a long time ago.

229
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,809
Oh, no. You really
don't have to tell me

230
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,896
- your whole life story, please.
- You may want to sit.

231
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:18,151
It is at times quite... painful.

232
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,903
Okay, here we go.

233
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,492
It was a year in which
the rain had not fallen.

234
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,287
The wind was big and
the basket was small.

235
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,957
For days, I bounced along...

236
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:37,504
a hungry little kitten with no
milk, no mama, and no litter box.

237
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:42,175
Until I came to rest at a
home for lost children.

238
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,306
Ohh.

239
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:54,020
Her name was lmelda.
And, like a Mother,

240
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:57,691
she took me into her heart
and raised me as her own.

241
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,444
Silencio.

242
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,738
Silencio.

243
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,116
She was an Angel of kindness.

244
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,159
ISilencio!

245
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,453
Most of the time.

246
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,207
I'd like to introduce
a new boyjoining us.

247
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:18,044
It's Okay, pequeﾃｱo. You
show with the face.

248
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,299
Go on.

249
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,308
And that was the moment I met...

250
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,310
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

251
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,479
Hey, whiskers!

252
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,732
You're sitting in Little
Boy Blue's chair.

253
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,401
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

254
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,653
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

255
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,613
Who asked you, Breakfast?

256
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,240
Remember what lmelda
says, Boy Blue.

257
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,535
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

258
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,495
Let's spin him.

259
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,330
Please don't spin me.
Do not spin me!

260
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,958
Not again! No! I'm gonna yolk!

261
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,670
Even though he took
my beans, the egg stood up for me,

262
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,964
and I decided then...

263
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,341
that I would
always have his back.

264
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,850
Wow!

265
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,186
That was very impressive.
Thanks!

266
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,480
Hey, egg boy!

267
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,735
There was something
about this strange little egg

268
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,862
that intrigued me.

269
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,923
Oh... it's you.

270
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,531
I've been collecting
for months now.

271
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,110
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

272
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,306
Magic beans... is what they are.

273
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,393
Hello? You gonna tell
all the other kids

274
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,146
that I believe in magic now?
Is that what you're gonna do?

275
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,359
No? What's your name?

276
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,821
You don't say much, do you?

277
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,365
I think I'll call you Sparky.

278
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,659
Whiskers?

279
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,035
Zoltar!

280
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,748
How about Puss?

281
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,627
Humpty's mind was full
of imagination and invention.

282
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,435
What is that,
50 feet down there?

283
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:29,050
Here we go. Give me a... Puss!

284
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:33,346
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

285
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,353
He spoke of legends
and adventures beyond my wildest dreams.

286
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,606
Oh, when I find those magic
beans, they'll grow a Vine

287
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,942
straight up into the clouds,

288
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,405
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

289
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,199
the Golden Goose.

290
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,577
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

291
00:24:55,744 --> 00:25:00,707
Just one of her Golden eggs...
could set me for life.

292
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,293
It's my destiny, Puss.

293
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,923
I can't really explain it, but I
just feel like I belong up there.

294
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,597
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

295
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,434
This is kind of a
solo dream here.

296
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,687
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

297
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,775
What are you doing?
Oh, man, that's good.

298
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,571
The eye thing that you're
doing, that is really splendid.

299
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,741
Okay, let me just think for a
second. All right... Okay.

300
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:38,203
Uh... This is crazy, but...

301
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,539
I am considering
a partnership.

302
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,043
I just need to know one thing.

303
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,378
Can you commit?

304
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,797
Sﾃｭ... I can commit.

305
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,259
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

306
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,971
Okay...

307
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,266
First rule of Bean Club...

308
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:04,729
you do not talk
about Bean Club.

309
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,731
Second rule of Bean Club...

310
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,944
is you don't talk about
Bean Club. You ready?

311
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,237
Ready.

312
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,406
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

313
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,952
Never alone, always together...

314
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,578
Humpty and Puss...

315
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,247
Brothers forever.

316
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,751
And from that moment on,
we were united on a great adventure

317
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,003
to find the magic beans.

318
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,213
Help me up.

319
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,006
Egg me.

320
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,800
Humpty was the brains...

321
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,844
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

322
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,722
- That really hurt!
- ... and I was the skill.

323
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,058
I'm cracked!

324
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,728
We got red beans, green beans,

325
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,065
coffee beans, lima beans...
but no magic beans.

326
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,903
- Would you care for a jelly bean?
- Oh, thank you.

327
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,531
Finding them
meant everything to us.

328
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,076
Oh, I almost forgot
the most important thing.

329
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,911
That's me and you, Puss.

330
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:04,914
Me and you.

331
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,583
But we never did find them.

332
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,004
And, as years passed, the
quest for magic beans

333
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,466
seemed more and more like
the dreams of a child.

334
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,676
Aw!

335
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,847
As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

336
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,849
and often found it.

337
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:27,186
Third time this month, lmelda.
Next time is jail time.

338
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
They're just kids.

339
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,233
They are thieves.

340
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,198
You are better than this.

341
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,535
I believe in you
with all my heart.

342
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,331
Please do not let me down.

343
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,082
I hate this place.

344
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,793
I cannot wait for us
to get out of here.

345
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,589
Throw a rock. It'll
make you feel better.

346
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,634
Oh, boy. We should go.

347
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,181
On instinct, I reacted.

348
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,349
Ha!

349
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,977
Aah!

350
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,199
He saved the
Comandante's Mother!

351
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,665
You saved my Mother.

352
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,668
Seﾃｱor Puss... he is a hero!

353
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:39,175
Today we see that
courage and bravery

354
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,219
come in all sizes!

355
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:45,807
Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

356
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,601
These are for you, my boy.

357
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,606
Wear them as a symbol of
honor... and justice.

358
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:57,527
I will make you proud, Mama.

359
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:02,698
You already have,
my Puss In Boots.

360
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,287
How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

361
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,624
but, whoa... I looked good!

362
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:15,294
And as the light of my
path grew brighter...

363
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,132
Humpty's road
grew ever darker.

364
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,306
Gracias, Comandante.

365
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,851
Be careful of the
company you keep.

366
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:35,064
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

367
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,358
You're not stealing
lollipops anymore, Humpty.

368
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:38,734
This is getting serious.

369
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,279
You're right! We have to
be smarter about this.

370
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,656
Here, look. We need
to think bigger.

371
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:46,576
I've been casing the
silversmith and it's perfect.

372
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,203
You and me, in and
out, 50 seconds tops.

373
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,998
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

374
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,792
These people have
done nothing to us.

375
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,421
Our home? Okay,
yeah, I get it now.

376
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,008
You get some fancy boots and
now you're too good for me?

377
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,551
That is not true.

378
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,803
We weren't born here.
We're orphans!

379
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,763
All we got is each
other, you understand?

380
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
We are better than this.

381
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,477
But we're partners.

382
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
We are brothers.

383
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,149
But I am not stealing anymore.

384
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,154
But Humpty
would not give up so easily.

385
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,281
I'm in trouble, Puss!

386
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,658
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

387
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,952
They're coming for me. Just
get me over this wall.

388
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,915
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

389
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,970
Okay, I've got everything. We
did it. Come on, let's go!

390
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,639
How could you do this to me?!

391
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,266
I did you a favor! We can
finally get out of here!

392
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,061
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

393
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,651
You disgrace those boots!

394
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,694
Comandante, please,
I can explain!

395
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,946
Arrest them!

396
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,615
Hiyah!

397
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,369
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

398
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,413
- You tricked me! - I had
to! You left me no choice!

399
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,757
Mama...

400
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,759
Pequeﾃｱo.

401
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,594
Oh! Watch out!

402
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,475
Oh! Oof!

403
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,698
- Oh, no.
- Puss. I can't get up.

404
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,992
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

405
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,577
Freeze!

406
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,079
Puss, save me!

407
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,206
Save yourself.

408
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,584
We got you.

409
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,185
I lost everything
I cared about that day.

410
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,022
My brother.

411
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,690
My honor.

412
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,358
My home.

413
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:30,448
All I thought about was the
disappointment in my mama's eyes.

414
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,368
And I have been
running ever since.

415
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,375
The egg betrayed me.

416
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:46,422
His lies cost me everything.

417
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,717
- Hey!
- I'm awake!

418
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,011
You think
I don't want to fix the past?

419
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,016
I can't get down.

420
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:10,029
Listen. A day... A
day doesn't go by

421
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,323
when I don't think
about what I lost.

422
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,036
I lost my best friend.

423
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,206
My only friend.
And I get it now.

424
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,583
I got greedy and desperate
and I let you down.

425
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,794
I let myself down.

426
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,463
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

427
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:31,592
Give me that second chance and I'll
help you pay back San Ricardo.

428
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,679
Please, Puss.

429
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,723
Let me show you what our
friendship meant to me.

430
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,272
- I will do it.
- Oh, that's great.

431
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,444
I will do this for my Mother and
for San Ricardo... not for you.

432
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,989
We are not partners and
we are not friends.

433
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,621
Okay. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

434
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:03,666
Yes!

435
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,293
I think we got our
Bean Club back.

436
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:27,648
Humpty's plan better work.

437
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,651
Listen, you just need to
worry about your part.

438
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,820
Don't screw it up.

439
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,322
- What?
- Again with the mask?

440
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,284
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

441
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,452
Huh?!

442
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,335
Come on, Puss. Now!

443
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,217
Our biological clocks
are ticking, darling.

444
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,746
You gotta look at
the big picture.

445
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,971
- What's your problem?
- Huh?

446
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:03,017
Listen. I put a lot of work into
my body. I look good, and I am not

447
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,705
just gonna throw that away.

448
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,648
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

449
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,150
- We're gonna start small.
- Look.

450
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,402
Let's just pretend
you have a baby.

451
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,698
Excellent.

452
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,221
I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

453
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,915
You don't have to, Jill. I'll
be the stay-at-home dad.

454
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,542
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

455
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,504
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

456
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,589
- Little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

457
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,397
- Shh!
- He's a cute little bugger.

458
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,551
Why are you not
using your claws?

459
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,678
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

460
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,306
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

461
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,975
- Your claws! - I don't
have any claws, all right?!

462
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,144
Was that Hamhock?

463
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,356
Shh. Shh. Shh.

464
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,362
There, there. Sleepy,
sleepy, big, fat piggy.

465
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,214
Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time?

466
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,035
You babysit.

467
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,788
- Soft paws.
- When did we have a monkey?

468
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,751
- Well?
- ... what happened last time...

469
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,921
- You sat on it, Jack.
- Hello, beans of legend.

470
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,882
Let's go.

471
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,519
Well, well, well. Look
what we have here, Jill.

472
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,230
You messed with our baby.

473
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,193
And you took my beans.

474
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,362
Sausage bomb!

475
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,489
Whoa!

476
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:47,037
You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

477
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,457
Signal the egg!

478
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,003
Yes!

479
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,592
- Okay.
- Ready.

480
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,302
- Set.
- Go!

481
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,429
Ow!

482
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,361
Oh, my God!

483
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,953
Whoa!

484
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,127
Ah!

485
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,007
All right, cat.
Give me them beans.

486
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,428
Is it true a cat always
lands on it's feet?

487
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,348
No! That is just a
rumor spread by dogs!

488
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,642
Well, let's find out.

489
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,018
Hiyah!

490
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,978
Hiyah!

491
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,984
See? I told you I
wouldn't let you down!

492
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,196
You think this is over? Ha!

493
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,370
Hey, that was close!

494
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,543
Hiyah!

495
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:20,881
Now!

496
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,346
We just got to make it
to that bridge! Hang on!

497
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,266
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

498
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,566
Humpty!

499
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:47,658
We're going to die!

500
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,256
- I hate cats.
- This is war!

501
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,641
Giant's castle...

502
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,810
here we come.

503
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,815
I must hand it to the egg.

504
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,776
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

505
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:26,113
I mean, flaws. That was
what I meant, not claws.

506
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,282
He's not a cat.

507
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,326
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

508
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,870
Got it.

509
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,914
Okay, we should be close!

510
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,209
Keep your eyes out for any
strange cloud activity!

511
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,088
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

512
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,549
and you'll never even
know I was there.

513
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,890
Kitty?

514
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,185
You are not as good as they say.

515
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,189
You're better.

516
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,819
I will respect your privacy.

517
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,951
Okay. I'll tell you.

518
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,746
I was just a stray...

519
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,582
but I had beautiful claws.

520
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,629
One day, a really nice
couple took me in.

521
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,131
Gave me milk every morning.

522
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,633
Loved me.

523
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:34,473
Maybe I scratched their curtains or
played too rough with the hamster.

524
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,975
I don't know why they did it.

525
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
But they took my claws.

526
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:45,400
Cat people are crazy.

527
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,319
Stop the coach! I
think this is it!

528
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:57,371
Ooh! Whoo!

529
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,633
Can you believe this, Puss?

530
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,553
After all these years!

531
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:17,224
Here. I want you to plant them.

532
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,315
That... is a strange cloud.

533
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,822
Whoa! Okay! This is it!
It's happening, hurry!

534
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,034
This way!

535
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,287
Good, good. Come on,
come on, come on.

536
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,706
Twenty-three divided
by cloud depth.

537
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,541
Hole! Right here.

538
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,087
Now place the beans.

539
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,091
Place the beans carefully, please.

540
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,428
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

541
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,557
Okay, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

542
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,175
Whoa!

543
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,227
What's happening here?

544
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,187
Maybe the magic rubbed
off in your pocket?

545
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,565
- That's impossible.
- Okay, Okay. Let's not panic.

546
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,813
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

547
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:54,655
So, come on... say
something nice to it.

548
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,906
Okay.

549
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,575
Let me just think for a second.

550
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,410
Hi, little plant.

551
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,503
Whoa!

552
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,438
Yow!

553
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,606
Oh!

554
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,702
Uh, guys? Whoa!

555
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,704
Humpty!

556
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,874
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

557
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,251
You sound weird.

558
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,379
Ah! It's the thin air!

559
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,176
Come on in! It feels great!

560
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,518
- The cloud, it tickles my nose.
- Hoo-hoo!

561
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,189
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew? Ho-ho!

562
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,237
Come on.

563
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,340
Gotcha!

564
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,471
Meow.

565
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,641
Hey, Puss. What do you think?
Do I shave?

566
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,602
Let me show you something.

567
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,028
Somewhere down there, there
are two little kids,

568
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,322
I don't know, maybe orphans,

569
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,409
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

570
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,327
dreaming about the future.

571
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,163
That was me and you, Puss.

572
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,833
Me and you.

573
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,961
Boys!

574
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:59,089
You might want to
take a look at this.

575
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,303
The giant's castle.

576
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,559
Okay, time to suit up.

577
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,768
Humpty!

578
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,104
I'll fit right in
with the Golden eggs.

579
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,818
Brilliant or what, huh?

580
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:23,530
Humpty, you're not
wearing underwear!

581
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,199
What? Are you embarrassed?

582
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,617
I'm not.

583
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,372
Puss, remember when
everyone was laughing at Bean Club?

584
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,542
And who is laughing now?
Ha-ha! We are!

585
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,221
Wow!

586
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,570
That is our target.

587
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,058
Hey, you don't
sound like an elf anymore.

588
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,782
It's because the air
pressure in here is normal.

589
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,950
Let's go.

590
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,625
You two get the
Golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

591
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,544
There's no giant to fight. The
giant's been dead for years.

592
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,963
- What?! - You didn't do
the reading, did you?

593
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,592
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter
14, "Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

594
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,512
Ahh! Ankle burn.

595
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,350
- Wha... what was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

596
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,936
It's the monster that
guards the Golden Goose.

597
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,605
Legend has it that if you look
at it, you'll turn to Stone.

598
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:42,317
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

599
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,402
Follow me and keep quiet.

600
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,747
Shh! Humpty!

601
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,833
I can't help it. Everything's
rubbing and pinching!

602
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,544
I need powder!

603
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,311
How are we gonna get across?

604
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:20,480
Champagne.

605
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,318
Cheers!

606
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,915
Do not worry. I
will protect you.

607
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,086
What are you gonna do?

608
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,088
Hit it in the head
with a guitar?

609
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,300
Please. Stop bringing
up the guitar.

610
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,195
Catch me!

611
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,615
Hurry!

612
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,367
Hide!

613
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,870
Don't look at it!

614
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,128
- Shh! Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

615
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,882
I said I couldn't breathe and
then you zipped the thing over my mouth!

616
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,469
Shh! Hey. You gotta get
it together. Come on!

617
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,887
Okay.

618
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,530
Look at this.
It's egg paradise.

619
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,785
It's so beautiful, I
feel like I belong here.

620
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,498
Whoo!

621
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,502
Golden eggs. Oh!

622
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,088
Grab as many as you can.

623
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,051
I thought they were
going to be like chicken size.

624
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:17,430
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

625
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,101
Puss! Ow!

626
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:23,621
How are we supposed to
get these out of here?

627
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,021
- I don't know.
- Shh!

628
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,484
Oh, my!

629
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,115
The Golden Goose.

630
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,452
Just look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

631
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:50,004
Oh!

632
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,549
Oh... My sweet darling.

633
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,094
I think she likes you.

634
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,669
Let's just take her.

635
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,600
Wait a minute. This is
the goose of legend.

636
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,408
We don't know what
happens if we take her.

637
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,982
I know what happens if we don't
take her, we got nothing.

638
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,278
Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper.
We're taking it!

639
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,122
Almost there!

640
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,042
Hang on!

641
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,216
Hang on!

642
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,434
Ow!

643
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,144
Whoa!

644
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,614
It's coming!

645
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,324
Run!

646
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,341
Kitty!

647
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,220
What are you doing?

648
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,703
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

649
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,083
Come here, you.

650
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:54,963
Got you!

651
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,882
She's mine now!

652
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,561
Hello!

653
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:18,111
Oh, no! Fly, little
gosling, fly!

654
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:25,159
No! It's not supposed
to be this way!

655
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,830
- Puss?
- No.

656
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,007
Uh... I'm sorry.

657
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,174
Hmm.

658
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,482
Thanks, Ginger.

659
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,116
Um, we should maybe
cut that down.

660
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:10,371
Look at that.

661
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,457
You finally got that
family you wanted, Jack.

662
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,876
Did you hear that?

663
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,377
I think he just called me Daddy.

664
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,882
- Oh! He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

665
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,187
Well, what is it?

666
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,690
Huh?

667
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:47,325
I do believe that's our cue.

668
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,160
Hah!

669
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,465
To paying back San Ricardo!

670
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,458
To being rich!

671
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,751
IOIﾃｩ!

672
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,681
Ha! Ha!

673
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,392
You.

674
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,977
Me?

675
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,312
Yeah, yeah, baby!

676
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,149
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

677
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,777
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!
One, two...

678
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,278
What?!

679
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,034
There is one word for you,
Me-wow!

680
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:32,620
I know you have quite a
reputation with the ladies,

681
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,123
Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

682
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,126
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

683
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,547
But that was before I met you.

684
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:43,965
You don't know me, Puss.

685
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,760
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm all about the score.

686
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,971
Come on. Look me in the eyes

687
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:52,849
and tell me all you
care about is the gold.

688
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,936
- Puss...
- Kitty...

689
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,396
Oh, my God!

690
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:02,608
New partners!

691
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,278
Do not fall
for his animal magnetism.

692
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:06,529
You stay focused.

693
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:08,781
- Ah!
- What?!

694
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,626
So... I have
been thinking, Miss Softpaws,

695
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,589
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

696
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,257
together.

697
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,511
Puss, you have to go, now.

698
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,097
You do not have to
push me away anymore.

699
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,224
- You can trust me.
- But...

700
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,143
Give it up for the
legends of San Ricardo,

701
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,604
Humpty and Puss! We did it!

702
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:45,318
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

703
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:49,280
No, I feel a...
Hairball coming on.

704
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,992
Okay, yeah. Have
fun with that!

705
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,203
We should give her some privacy.

706
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,249
I never thought we
would get to here.

707
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,878
After all we went through...

708
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,380
to pull this off, together.

709
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,593
It is good to have
my brother back.

710
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,263
Yep. Sure is.

711
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,933
Well, we have
a big day tomorrow.

712
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:20,186
Pretty exciting stuff.

713
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,729
We should get some rest.

714
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,609
Good night, Humpty.

715
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,574
Canasta!

716
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,024
I am still alive!

717
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,448
Jack and Jill.

718
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,742
Kitty?

719
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,578
Humpty?

720
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,790
I will find you.

721
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,338
Get out of here!

722
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,636
Huh?

723
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,435
Be gone!

724
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,482
What do you want?
Gold? I have gold!

725
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,485
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

726
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,278
With our own gold.

727
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,566
Come on now, all we want
is a little breakfast.

728
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,740
No, no, please!

729
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,575
How do you like
your eggs, pumpkin?

730
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,160
Humpty, no!

731
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,085
Hello, Puss.

732
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,878
Surprise!

733
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,132
What is going on?

734
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,303
It's a surprise party, and
the surprise is on you.

735
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,056
Looks like the cat's
out of the bag.

736
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:03,683
You were in cahoots?!

737
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,310
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

738
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:13,526
I spent a lot of time in
prison preparing for this.

739
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,529
- You set me up. - Oh, yeah,
I set you up. Of course.

740
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:21,033
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

741
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,663
This little adventure
was about one thing.

742
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,957
Revenge.

743
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:35,131
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there.

744
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:59,030
You wanted to repay an old
debt, Puss? Well, so did I.

745
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,116
- Why would you do this?
- You left me on that bridge!

746
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,368
You abandoned me when I
needed you the most.

747
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,163
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

748
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,492
Well, now you're finally gonna
know what it feels like,

749
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,335
you know, to trust someone and
have them stab you in the back.

750
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,295
Guards!

751
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:19,258
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest for
the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

752
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,427
Consider this the final
meeting of Bean Club.

753
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,180
I should scramble you with onions!

754
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,766
You should never have come back.

755
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,354
ﾂ｡Pequeﾃｱo! Wait.

756
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,647
Do not fight them, please.

757
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,609
Mama! Listen to me.
I can explain.

758
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:41,197
No. Puss, no more running.

759
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,493
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

760
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,289
I'm sorry, Mama.

761
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,042
I let you down.

762
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,922
Paws where we can see them!

763
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,092
Turn around... slow.

764
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,762
Slower!

765
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,522
Step into the carrier...
quiet-like.

766
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,937
Attention! Attention, everyone!

767
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,283
If you could just come
in a little closer.

768
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,993
Ladies and gentlemen,

769
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,497
I present to you... the
Golden Goose of legend!

770
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,630
Kitty. Not you, too?

771
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,846
Gold for everyone!

772
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,432
Boo! Boo! Boo!

773
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,226
We got some fresh, hot
gold here, people!

774
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:56,689
Step right up! Get it hot!

775
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:59,191
IHuevos! IHuevos! IHuevos!

776
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,617
One hat.

777
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,911
One belt.

778
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,330
And two boots...

779
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,292
once a symbol of honor.

780
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,254
One bottle of catnip?

781
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:23,424
Uh... it is for my glaucoma.

782
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,598
This is where you
belong, outlaw.

783
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:35,478
And this is where you
will stay... forever.

784
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,453
Whoo-hoo!

785
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,539
No, no. Don't stop
on my account.

786
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,764
Well, it looks like the
egg got what he wanted.

787
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:13,724
You're talking about Humpty?

788
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,476
Don't say his name!

789
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:19,230
I used to share this cell
with that smelly thing.

790
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,441
Happiest day of my
life was when he left.

791
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:25,194
Till I realized he
stole my magic beans.

792
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,405
Wait, wait, wait! You had
the beans? Who are you?

793
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,450
Hey! What's your name?

794
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:34,161
Andy Beanstalk!

795
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,247
My friends call me Jack.

796
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,625
I traded the family
cow for them beans.

797
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,627
Course'n, it wasn't
my family's cow.

798
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,797
It was some other family's family
cow. That's why I got eight to ten.

799
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:49,051
Always know which cow is yours.

800
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,512
Crazy man. Wake up!

801
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,265
What else do you know?

802
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:58,352
We're all goners, thanks
to that little stinky!

803
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,566
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

804
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,943
Don't take the goose. Why?

805
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:13,450
The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

806
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,868
Oh, no.

807
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,705
And she will be out for blood

808
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:21,375
when she comes
back for her baby.

809
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:22,960
Guard!

810
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,213
San Ricardo is in terrible
danger! You must listen to me!

811
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,381
Quiet, you!

812
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,324
Shut up.

813
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:04,668
Shh!

814
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,093
Open the door.

815
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,061
Drop the weapon.

816
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,189
Very good.

817
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,524
Step aside.

818
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,860
No.

819
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,654
Diablo Gato!

820
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,657
Nice try.

821
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,578
Huh?

822
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,545
I hope you can forgive me.

823
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,173
Apology accepted!

824
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,551
I don't really
have time for you.

825
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,804
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

826
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,847
Wait, Puss!

827
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,016
Don't you see? I'm
here because...

828
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,520
I am here because
you made me realize

829
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:08,232
that there is something I
care about more than gold.

830
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,651
Something?

831
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,987
Okay. Someone.

832
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,699
He's about two feet
tall, wears high heels.

833
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,325
Handsome?

834
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,494
He's very handsome.

835
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,579
- A real beefcake?
- Mm-hm.

836
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,039
- A stallion?
- Yes.

837
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,958
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

838
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,211
But this
does not make us even.

839
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,464
- Freeze!
- Yes, it does.

840
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,425
No, no, no, it doesn't.

841
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,847
I saved you!

842
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:42,182
You owed me one.

843
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,810
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

844
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,522
So now you owe me two.

845
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,821
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

846
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,614
Ha-ha!

847
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:02,870
You are not getting
away, Puss In Boots!

848
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,038
Wrong boots.

849
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,124
Kitty!

850
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,501
Now we're even!

851
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:19,970
This is your San Ricardo
weather report.

852
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,848
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

853
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,975
one hundred percent.

854
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,566
Never alone, always together...

855
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:33,984
Humpty and Puss...

856
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,736
Brothers forever.

857
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,157
Come on, sweetie.

858
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,576
Let's, uh, get out of here
before Mama shows up.

859
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,830
I should make you into
an egg salad sandwich!

860
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,583
That is disgusting!

861
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:53,253
- Give me the goose, Humpty.
- No can do, I'm afraid.

862
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,421
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

863
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,343
it's bye-bye San Ricardo and
everything you ever cared about!

864
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:03,931
Revenge on me is one thing,
but why lmelda? Why the orphanage?

865
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,724
This is our home.

866
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,726
You mean your home.

867
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:12,022
I never belonged here.

868
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,565
We had a plan to
get out of here,

869
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,777
but then you became a hero and
you picked this place over me.

870
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,031
You left me with nothing.

871
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,705
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

872
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,293
But do not take it
out on these people.

873
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,128
You are better than this!

874
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,674
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

875
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,551
I know the real Humpty.

876
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:44,847
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

877
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,516
What happened to that guy?

878
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,148
I... I think it's too late.

879
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,609
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

880
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,153
Together we can
save San Ricardo!

881
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:09,454
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

882
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,707
Really?

883
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,293
After everything I
put you through?

884
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,254
Prove to me there is
still a good egg in you.

885
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,049
I'll try.

886
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,840
Run!

887
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:15,479
- Goggles, check.
- Get the baby over the bridge.

888
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:16,647
I'll get the Mother to follow.

889
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:20,025
Okay. Give me a... Puss!

890
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,700
Ha-ha!

891
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,258
Mama Goose!

892
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,805
Wait!

893
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:54,226
Just follow me and I will
lead you to your baby.

894
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,900
No! Not that way!

895
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,362
Pequeﾃｱo, help!

896
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,989
Hang on!

897
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,619
Oh.

898
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,706
Whoa!

899
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,958
That's my boy!

900
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:19,835
Ha!

901
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:25,465
Come with me, Mama Goose. I
know where your baby is.

902
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,968
Here. Look!

903
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:39,271
Ha-ha!

904
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,273
Humpty, pick up the pace!

905
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,775
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

906
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,492
Sorry, egghead, we want
more than just eggs.

907
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,453
So how about you
give us that goose!

908
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,205
Humpty!

909
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,454
Get her off!

910
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,712
- Nice moves.
- What would you do without me?

911
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:09,593
Freeze!

912
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:16,099
Comandante! Uh, I can explain?

913
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:21,813
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

914
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,273
Humpty, hurry!

915
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:26,610
We're almost there.
We're almost there!

916
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:52,677
- Puss, help!
- Humpty, hang on!

917
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:55,597
Puss!

918
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:07,150
Here we are again, right, Puss?

919
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,198
I will not leave you
behind this time, Humpty.

920
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,456
Uh...

921
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,542
I'm sorry, Puss.

922
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,502
I've made a mess
out of everything.

923
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,047
I'm a rotten egg.

924
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,967
I'm not a person.

925
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:35,846
I'm not a bird. I'm
not even a food.

926
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,682
I don't know what I am.

927
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,227
You are what you
have always been.

928
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:44,187
My brother.

929
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,525
Brothers forever.

930
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:53,280
Whoa!

931
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:05,375
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

932
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:12,007
Puss, you have to save the baby, or
the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

933
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:15,760
It's the right thing to do.

934
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,892
I will not let you go, Humpty.

935
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:24,102
I know you won't.

936
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,397
So I won't make you choose.

937
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,234
Humpty!

938
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,340
I'm very sorry.

939
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,091
She's Okay.

940
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:04,351
Humpty?

941
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:26,665
I always knew that you
were good inside.

942
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,180
Goodbye, Humpty.

943
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:56,569
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

944
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,321
It's him. Puss In Boots.

945
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,323
He saved us from
the giant goose!

946
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,409
His sword is like lightning!

947
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,369
They say he has ten lives.

948
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:08,415
His boots are made of the
finest Corinthian leather.

949
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,875
He only drinks whole milk.

950
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,672
Good leche.

951
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,134
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

952
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,845
Uh, meow?

953
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:26,057
A gift for you, Mama.

954
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,731
I have to go. The soldiers
are coming for me.

955
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:39,779
I am so proud of you, my son.

956
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:44,576
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

957
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,412
You earned those boots.

958
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:52,584
And the people know that you are
San Ricardo's greatest hero.

959
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,462
I did it for you, Mama.

960
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:59,382
You will always be in my heart.

961
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,760
And you in mine.

962
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,389
ﾂ｡Gato! Hmm?

963
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:09,059
- There he is!
- I see him!

964
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,394
Huh?

965
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,112
Toot-toot!

966
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,175
Ha! Ha!

967
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:53,728
I will see you again,
Kitty Softpaws!

968
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,773
Sooner than you think.

969
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:00,693
Ah!

970
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,950
She is a bad Kitty.

971
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:16,459
This is the story
of a cat who became a hero.

972
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:21,131
An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.

973
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:24,926
A great... great lover.

974
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,720
Really. It is crazy.

975
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,640
I am Puss In Boots!

976
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:35,145
And my name would become...
legend!

977
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,188
Ha-ha!

978
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,742
Ha!

979
01:19:57,585 --> 01:20:00,086
Ha!

980
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:04,424
Whoo-hoo!

981
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,510
Ha!

982
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:09,637
Meow.

983
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,397
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

984
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:56,226
Ohhh!
