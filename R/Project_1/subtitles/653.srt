give them a dance?

47
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,150
- You want a dance?
- No, thank you.

48
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,460
Hello. How you doing?

49
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:05,680
Back off, bitch.

50
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,252
So, minus 40% is $287.

51
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,471
Minus $160.

52
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,124
You said it was $130.

53
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,865
Well, you got here after five,
didn't you?

54
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,134
Bye, new girl.

55
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,788
Is he bothering you?

56
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:28,877
Listen, he bothers you,
you got my number, right?

57
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,749
You need anything,
you call me.

58
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,491

Coke. Anything.

59
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,755

Oh, my God.
That couple that I was dancing for,

64
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,986
they were generous,
but his breath was, like, hot.

65
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:55,687
Hey there, sexy,
how you doing?

66
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:00,518
Figure she loses a
husband, she's gotta get surgery...

67
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,781
She got hit by a stick.
Does that count as surgery?

68
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:04,783
She looks like
she was sucking on a lemon.

69
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,192
All right, Grandma.
I gotta go.

70
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,151
Did you get something to eat?

71
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,196
I'm gonna eat
at the diner, okay?

72
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,459
What happened
to your necklace?

73
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:31,636
It's fine, Dorothy.

74
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,555
- Here.
- No, you keep it.

75
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,253
What do I need it for?
Come on.

76
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,995
You take
such good care of me.

77
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,868

like, really a model?

105
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,249
Yeah, she'd like to think so.

106
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:19,864
I mean, some of the girls have been

107
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,997
I was a centerfold once.

108
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:24,433
No way.

109
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:26,653
'93.

110
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,568

112
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,181
Back when Stevie Wonder
came in.

113
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,271
What the fuck did Stevie
Wonder come to the club for?

114
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:40,014
Casey had him
in the Champagne Room.

115
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,537
Swears to God he isn't blind.

116
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:42,887
Wow.

117
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,545
How come you're so good?

118
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,288
I see you with
every single kinda guy, and...

119
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,857
I don't know, it's like you
have 'em all figured out.

120
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:59,251
I guess
I'm just a people person.

121
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,909
You know? It's easier if you think of them
as, like, your rich friends, you know?

122
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,911
Some of them are not so bad.

123
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,131
Where else you dance?

124
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,351
I was at Sin City...

125
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,744
- for way too long.
- Mmm.

126
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:19,053
Then I heard some boiler room guys saying
how all the money was in the city, so...

127
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,099
So, you followed
the green brick road?

128
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,579
- Yup.
- So far so good?

129
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,712
I mean, it's okay.

130
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:26,931
Get out.

131
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,020
I mean,
you must be cleaning up.

132
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,543
You're new.

133
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,458
You're fucking gorgeous.

134
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,851
You're Asian.

135
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,244
It's like a triple threat.

136
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,986
But I'm not that good.

137
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,249
I mean, if I...

138
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:46,864
Maybe if you, like, I don't
know, showed me moves.

139
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:53,783
Maybe we could work together.

140
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:55,394
You know?

141
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,876
I could give you
a crash course in this place.

142
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:01,922
Introduce you
to some of my regulars.

143
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:06,448
It's just mostly Wall Street guys
looking to spend money on pretty girls.

144
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,108
What do you think of that?

145
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:18,330
- Yeah, that would be cool.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:22,377
So, it was Ramona's
idea that you two work together?

147
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,075
Yes, that's right.

148
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,295
And at this point,
everything was aboveboard.

149
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:29,732
I mean,
I thought she was nice.

150
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:34,389
And when would you say that
things got out of control?

151
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,484
Ramona was always in control.

152
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,313
Front hook.

153
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:47,533
Ankle hook. Yup.

154
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:49,491
Knee hook.

155
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,971
Hold on with that knee.

156
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,407
Okay.

157
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,409
From here,
you could do the carousel.

158
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,542
Put your head back.

159
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:58,587
Come down.

160
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,200
You can do Peter Pan.

161
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:04,680
Knee hook.

162
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:05,855
Just spin.

163
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:09,381
Jesus Christ.

164
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:11,209
Then you can go
into a fairy sit.

165
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,341
Oh.

166
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,213
Stag.

167
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,302
- That's pretty.
- Reverse stag.

168
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:18,781
That's pretty too.

169
00:12:18,956 --> 00:12:20,000
Scissor sit.

170
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:23,743
Table top.

171
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,136
I can't do that.

172
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,051
You can do that.
You're gonna do that.

173
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,966
A climb.

174
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,840
What if you don't have muscles
to do that?

175
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,798
- You have muscles to do this.
- I don't have any.

176
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,496
Every girl
has muscles to do this.

177
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,715
You could do this one,
this is a martini.

178
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,631
Fireman down.

179
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,072
Boom.

180
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,857
- That's... pretty good.
- Ready?

181
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,163
Push it, baby.

182
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:53,991
You go.

183
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,429
- There you go. Just point your toes.
- Okay.

184
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:58,734
There you go.
Hold yourself up.

185
00:12:58,908 --> 00:12:59,953
I'm trying.

186
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,348
Try laying flat across.
Do a tabletop.

187
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:05,959
They all love seeing that.
Makes you look strong.

188
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,178
Okay.

189
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,183
- There you go. Yes. Okay.
- Yeah?

190
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,968
- This does hurt my vagina.
- Can you grab your foot?

191
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,231
There you go.

192
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:18,841
- This doesn't look sexy.
- You know what?

193
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,234
- Thumb up your butt, almost.
- Thumb up my butt?

194
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,540
- You know how to do that.
- How do I...

195
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,150
- Put your head back.
- I'm gonna fall.

196
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,847
You're not gonna fall.
Straighten your legs out.

197
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,110
- Both of them?
- Point your toes.

198
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,938
Yes! Yeah, point your toe.

199
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:30,940
Oh, my God.

200
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,687
We gotta get you outta those
training pumps into a good shoe.

201
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,559
I know.
It's hard for me to balance.

202
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,475
No. It's easier in these.

203
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,999
Hey, you know Diamond
from the Bronx, right?

204
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,828
What's up, baby-boogie-down-
fucking-Bronx-bitch?

205
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:51,961
Come on, she's gonna help you.

206
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:53,093
- You're gonna help me?
- You're gonna help us out right now.

207
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,051
- Get in the chair.
- Okay.

208
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,574
Get in the chair.

209
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:58,011
You're gonna help her learn
how to do a real dance.

210
00:13:58,185 --> 00:14:00,144
- Oh, my gosh.
- Okay. I'm good with that.

211
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,363
- Okay.
- Come on. Show me what the fuck you got.

212
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:06,411
There, that's good.

213
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:08,717
I really just go like that.

214
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,024
- No, wait. Wait.
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

215
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,157
- I'm trying to grind his dick.
- Arch your back more.

216
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,507
Oh, my. Move your hair,
look at me or something.

217
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:18,249
- Push your butt out.
- No. I know I'm hopeless.

218
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:19,728
No, look, that's it.

219
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,948
You don't have to be
the best dancer.

220
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:25,473
You just have to make their eyes
move just one inch. Come here.

221
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:26,779
- What do you mean?
- Let me tell you something.

222
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:27,780
- Show her.
- Okay.

223
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,347
Watch and learn.

224
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,088
- You fucking sit there.
- Sit, ma. Come on.

225
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,960
You drain the clock and not
the motherfucking cock,

226
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,353
you know what I'm saying?

227
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,094
And you just go slow.
Right there.

228
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:38,443
- Slow.
- And you look at them.

229
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:39,792
- Super slow.
- Uh-huh.

230
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,533
- Slower.
- A little slower.

231
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,274
- Slower.
- Sexier.

232
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,840
- Yes.
- And look back at it.

233
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,322
Oh, yeah. They love that.
The slower the better.

234
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,889
Like a motherfucking sloth.

235
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,412
- That's $20 right there.
- Slow.

236
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,371
Remember, drain the clock,
not the cock.

237
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,242
- Drain the clock, not the cock.
- That's it.

238
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,027
Come on, now you look
like you're taking a shit.

239
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:03,076
You can't deny she got it.
We gonna make some money tonight.

240
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,904
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

241
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,688
I said: "Are we gonna make
some fucking money tonight?"

242
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,429
Yeah!

243
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,171
Tracey, have you met Destiny?

244
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,651
No. Hey.
You're from Queens, right?

245
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,131
Yeah, Kew Gardens.

246
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:15,784
- Okay, I'm from Briarwood.
- Cool. Yeah.

247
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,438
Yeah.

248
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:18,483
And this is Star.

249
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:19,571
Hi.

250
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,138
And you've gotta meet Liz.

251
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,357
Liz. Liz!

252
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,229
She playin' a song
for Jackie's new titties.

253
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,666
- They're double-Ds!
- Jackie got new titties?

254
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,711
Yeah! New titties!

255
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,584
- It's this new gummy-bear technology.
- Yes! Who did these?

256
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:33,976
- Dr. Bobby.
- These are good.

257
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:35,064
Isn't he amazing?

258
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,631
Thank God for Dr. Bobby.

259
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,808
And this is Mercedes.
This my baby.

260
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,897
Hi. Nice to meet you.

261
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,290
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Destiny.

262
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,378
Tracey.

263
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,771
Your boyfriend's here.

264
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,555
- What? Girl, again?
- And he's crying.

265
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,078
Crying?

266
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,645
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah, hon.

267
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,299
What? Girl, what's going on
with Rodrigo?

268
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:54,301
Girl, I don't know. He's
just been so jealous lately.

269
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,911
- "Lately"?
- Yeah.

270
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,957
You can't let him drop
you off. You know that.

271
00:15:58,131 --> 00:15:59,654
I know.
But, like, you know how it is.

272
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,353
- At first, he liked this shit.
- Of course he did.

273
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,311
'Cause you wanna know why?

274
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,618
These motherfuckers think that
it's so fun to date a stripper

275
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:10,535
'cause it's like, "We move, and we fuck.
And we fuck the best. It's the shit."

276
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,668
And then, when they realize
that we work six nights a week,

277
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,280
last shit we wanna see
is their damn dicks.

278
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,064
Okay!

279
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:21,546
I just wanna chill on my couch
in some feetie pajamas

280
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,333
with my nigga, ice cream, no makeup,
and for damn sure not with these on.

281
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,598
Wait. I just make my boyfriend
masturbate beside me.

282
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,774
- What?
- Is that weird?

283
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,212
Shit. I haven't had sex
in two years.

284
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:36,735
- Oh, baby.
- Two years?

285
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:38,954
Well, I have a boyfriend.

286
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,129
Since when?

287
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,305
Since now.

288
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,353
He don't bother me.
He don't get jealous.

289
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,008
The only time he complain is when I
don't change the batteries, bitch.

290
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,099
Too bad he ain't got no money.

291
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,144
Well, bitch, I can't
have everything, can I?

292
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:58,626
Hey, ladies,
who wants cake?

293
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,020
Aww.

294
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,500
Ma, what are you doing to us?

295
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:04,328
You can't keep doing
this to us.

296
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:06,939
It's a little motivation
for my babies.

297
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,984
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Trying to make some extra tips.

298
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,770
- I wanna have a tiny, tiny little sliver.
- Teeny, teeny.

299
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:14,033
But only 'cause I know
you made it with love.

300
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,122
Go crazy. Get a big piece.

301
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,993
Everybody have a piece
of the fucking cake.

302
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,517
- Let me get my Tupperware.
- I don't want that cake.

303
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:20,779
Eat it.

304
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,435
Hey. You an investor
in this place?

305
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,914
No.

306
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,264
Then quit putting money
back into it.

307
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:28,743
Let the guys get fucked up.

308
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:32,747
First get 'em a single,
then a double, then a triple,

309
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:35,315
then go back to a double,
and then a single.

310
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,622
You want 'em drunk enough
to get their credit card,

311
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:39,493
but sober enough
to sign the check.

312
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,757
Lenny, give us a beat.

313
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,237
You got it, gorgeous.

00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,895

321
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,559
According to Ramona,

322
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,474
there were three tiers
of Wall Street guys.

323
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:07,739
The guys at the bottom, they don't
do anything dirty to make money.

324
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:09,871
So, most of them
don't have any.

325
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,787
But if they do, you can
milk 'em for every penny.

326
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,444
♪ I, I get it ♪

327
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:21,056
You know,
maybe they're in a loveless marriage.

328
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,625
Or maybe they're single
and feeling dejected.

329
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,282
Either way, you can string 'em
along without getting physical.

330
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,242
Chuck here pays for my
apartment on the Upper East Side

331
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,288
and I've never even sniffed
his dick.

332
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:42,513
The guys in the middle,
they'll get their hands a little dirty.

333
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,341
But they have their limits.

334
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,692
Don't tase me, bro.

335
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:51,217
They dabble in greed.
But they never cross a certain line.

336
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,654
Or maybe
they're not as good at it.

337
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,222
That's why they all share
a two-bedroom in Cobble Hill.

338
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,661
But then there's
the motherfuckers on top.

339
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,141
You're a dickwad,
fucking pussy.

340
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:06,101
CEOs, CFOs,
investment bankers,

341
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,844
corporate raiders,
hedge funders, ax murderers.

342
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:13,152
Found footage.
You like it? Take a look.

343
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:16,198
Look familiar?
Too close to home, mama?

344
00:19:16,373 --> 00:19:18,505
Coming straight from
the crime scene into the club.

345
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,378
But not through the front.
Oh, no.

346
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,510
These guys, they don't wanna
be written about on page six.

347
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:26,557
They come through the back.

348
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:29,603
They take the private elevator
to the one room without cameras.

349
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,736
How you feeling today?

350
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,868
Oh. Feel a lot better now.

351
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,696
- Make some money?
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:40,919
And they don't leave till they
spend $10,000, $15,000 in one night.

353
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:50,102
They can be degrading,
possessive, aggressive, violent.

354
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,800
And they never get
in any trouble.

355
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,977
Because everyone's willing
to cover their tracks.

356
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,025
'Cause deep down
they all want what they got.

357
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,942
They all wanna be on top...
where there are no consequences.

358
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,728
♪ I saw you ♪

359
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:11,819
You're just another deal to them.
And that's all they are to you.

360
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:19,827
♪ In a mist of a dream ♪

361
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:29,141
♪ I wonder why, oh, why ♪

362
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,491
It's business.

363
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,581
And it's a more honest transaction
than anything else they did that day.

364
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,062
♪ You were not there ♪

365
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:54,296
♪ You looked so good to me ♪

366
00:20:57,735 --> 00:21:02,870

369
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:18,799
All you have to do is figure
out who you're dealing with.

370
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,498
And then play them
at their level.

371
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,941
I'm gonna do that.

372
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
Let me help you.

373
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,168
I got it.

374
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,996
Hold on. Wait. You gotta
spread it out a little bit.

375
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:43,607
I did.

376
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,391
I gotta get a bigger boot.

377
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,524
Oh, my God. Wait.

378
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,700
- 'Kay, hold on.
- Wait, yeah, you got it.

379
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,179
I got it!

380
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,572
She wasn't in it
to make friends.

381
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,053
- Yay!
- It just happened.

382
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,240
- This is fucking hot.
- It's perfect.

383
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,808
- 'Cause it's classy. And I just wanna...
- No. I love it. It's perfect.

384
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,505
But do you think it's too big?

385
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,073
Are you kidding me?
A bag can never be too big.

386
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,857
Come on, let's ring you up.

387
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:23,777
What are you looking at?
Ring it up.

388
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:25,649
Thank you.

389
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,128
There you go, baby.

390
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,443
Okay.

391
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,492
Ta-da! I'm designing
my own swim-line.

392
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:45,930
- You made these?
- Uh-huh.

393
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,149
I like to use
a lot of mixed media.

394
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,499
So I, like,
find leather pieces,

395
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:53,502
and then I get little chains
and make belts out of them.

396
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:56,027
And this right here,
these are epaulets.

397
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:58,159
That's French for
"little shoulders."

398
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,205
You know, a lot of people are
afraid to wear denim in the ocean,

399
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,512
but I swear that these get more
comfortable when they're wet.

400
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,036
Specifically salt water.

401
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,864
Here. Try these on.

402
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:13,131
It's gonna take some time for me
to save up the money for my label,

403
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:16,308
but I do have a client
who's a graphic designer,

404
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,918
and he mocked-up
this logo for me.

405
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:20,921
"Swimona."

406
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,054
It's catchy, right?

407
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:24,664
Did you go to school for this?

408
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,318
Yep. Thirteen credits
away from graduating.

409
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,625
Oh, my God.
Those look amazing on you.

410
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,017
- Yeah.
- So hot.

411
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,716
Bear Cub, is that you?

412
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:34,282
Mom?

413
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,762
Oh, yes.

414
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,808
Hi, my gorgeous girl.

415
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:40,245
Hi. How's my little genius?

416
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,551
How's that big,
beautiful brain of yours?

417
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:47,382
Juliet, this is Mommy's
friend, Dorothy. Say hi.

418
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,036
Hi.

419
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,124
- Oh, yeah. She's always so shy...
- Hi.

420
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,648
Unless it's a cute boy.

421
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,214
I'll take it from here,
Manuela.

422
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,434
Ay, gracias, señora.

423
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,871
Goodbye, Juju.
Te quiero mucho.

424
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,744
What do you want
for dinner, baby?

425
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,616
I don't wanna be dependent
on anybody.

426
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,139
Like, ever.

427
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,011
You know?

428
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,624
I just wanna be able to take care of
my grandma for the rest of her life.

429
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,801
Maybe go shopping
every once in a while.

430
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,935
Yeah. That's how I feel.

431
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:21,068
I just want my daughter to be able
to do whatever she wants, you know?

432
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,941
Go to whatever school
she wants, or not.

433
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,161
If that's what she wants.

434
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:30,251
I swear,
I'd do anything for this kid.

435
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,602
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

436
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,911
Well, that would explain
my mother.

437
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,002
Hmm.

438
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,402
Is that how
you would describe her?

439
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:52,926
My mother?

440
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,319
I mean Ramona.

441
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:02,022
How much of this
is going into the article?

442
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,722
- Oh, I...
- It's just, I really hope

443
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:09,856
it's not some story about all
strippers being thieves or whatever.

444
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,771
- Not at all.
- 'Cause they're not.

445
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,121
And it's things like this
that add to a stigma,

446
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,210
and I don't wanna
perpetuate anything.

447
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,430
- Of course.
- You gotta understand.

448
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,214
I was making
an honest living then.

449
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,607
Everything was good.

450
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,653
Everybody was happy.
Everybody was making money.

451
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,961
- Beautiful couch.
- I know.

452
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,833
- That's your window.
- I got my own place in the city.

453
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:32,705
That's your floor. Your living room.
That's your floor.

454
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,142
Yes. And, of course...

455
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,753
my vagina.

456
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,452
I helped my grandma
get out of debt.

457
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,197
And Ramona inspired me
to go back to school.

458
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:47,241
Wow!

459
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:52,290
I'm sorry. It's just your
penmanship is really remarkable.

460
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,509
I'm Stephen.

461
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,033
You know, I just got
a vest just like that.

462
00:25:56,207 --> 00:25:57,817
- Do you?
- Yeah. I think it's really chic.

463
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,602
I'm really blown away
by your penmanship.

464
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:02,561
Seriously.
You could be a font.

465
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,954
Thanks.

466
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:05,607
Did you know
that they do that?

467
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,479
- No.
- They do.

468
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:12,701
They take your handwriting
and they make it into a font.

469
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:18,577
And then put it into your computer so
you can type with your own handwriting.

470
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,361
But I don't have a computer.

471
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:23,800
- Oh! Right.
- I know.

472
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:28,369
I mean, I guess that's why my
handwriting's so good, right?

473
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:34,114
Right. Right. Yes.

474
00:26:41,252 --> 00:26:43,341
2007 was the fucking best.

475
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,432
Sup, bro? You good?

476
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:51,915
Yo. Come here.

477
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,179
Hey.

478
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:56,571
What's going on?
What's your name?

479
00:26:57,268 --> 00:26:58,704
I'm Destiny.

480
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:00,793
- Destiny, I'm Johnny. Sup?
- Nice to meet you.

481
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,273
It's nice to meet you.

482
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,667
Fucking unbelievable.

483
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:07,278
- Where'd that necklace come from?
- Do you fucking hear yourself?

484
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:08,366
Hey! Come here.

485
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,020
Welcome to my family.

486
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,761
I'm Kim Kardashian.

487
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:15,112
The princess
is in the building!

488
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:19,986
I made more money that
year than a goddamn brain surgeon.

489
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:25,078
And, sure, some days sucked.
Like any other job.

490
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,298
But other days...

491
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:30,083
What do you think?

492
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:33,870
If I could fuck a car...

493
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:37,308
- I'd fuck this car.
- This is fucking it.

494
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:38,875
This is fucking it.

495
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:40,833
- Stick with me, baby.
- Yeah, let's do it.

496
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,574
What? Yes!

497
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,141
Oh, shit.

498
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:46,360
That's my motherfucking song
right there.

499
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,277
Girl.

500
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:53,672

00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:43,896
I'm gonna rub your back,
give you some pussy, go to bed.

519
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,593
All right? I'll see you.

520
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,247
Everybody has a job in here.

521
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,815
The bouncers, the house mom,
everybody but you.

522
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:53,732
All you do is get your fucking dick sucked
by the new bitches, rude fucking idiots!

523
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,212

Usher, baby.

551
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:41,666
And for one last moment...
everything was so glamorous and cool.

552
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:50,066
We begin our coverage tonight
of what's been called

553
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,417
"the worst financial crisis
in modern times."

554
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:57,899
Certainly, the largest financial
disaster in decades in this country,

555
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:01,164
and, perhaps,
the end of an era in American business.

556
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:05,516
Some of the biggest names in
American business are, tonight, gone,

557
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,866
along with a lot of money
and a lot of jobs.

558
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,216
The crash put
everybody out of business.

559
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,262
But I had other things
on my mind.

560
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,438
How am I gonna make money?

561
00:31:14,612 --> 00:31:17,397
...lost
504 points on the day's trading.

562
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,095
I'll take care of you.

563
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,575
Des, look at me. Look at me.

564
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,360
I promise.

565
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,144
I'll take care of you.

566
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,627
If he's a boy,
we'll name him Johnny.

567
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:32,412
I hope it's a boy.

568
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,943
After I stopped
working, I lost touch with Ramona.

569
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,165
That's just what happens
when you have a kid.

570
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:49,951
- Get out!
- Stick to it this time then.

571
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:52,389
- Stick to it this time.
- I will! Get the fuck away from me.

572
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,217
Go. Leave. We don't need you.

573
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:55,827
- Remember you said this.
- Get the fuck out.

574
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,481
It's what you wanted.
This is what you wanted.

575
00:31:57,655 --> 00:31:59,135
I don't give a shit!

576
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:00,658
This is the last fucking time
I'm doing this.

577
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,795
Hi, baby. It's okay. Shh.

578
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,060
Shh.

579
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:23,594
Hello?

580
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:26,336
Hey, Stephen. It's Destiny.

581
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,949
D... Destiny. Wh... Uh...

582
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,865
- Wow.
- Yeah.

583
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,954
Time flies, right?

584
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,131
Uh...
Where are you?

585
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:42,265
Well, you know,
I just got back to the city.

586
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:45,137
Um, I moved to Arizona
a few years ago.

587
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:48,445
- But I've missed the seasons.
- I'm just gonna take this downstairs.

588
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:50,882
And I really missed you.

589
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,320
Are you still there?

590
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:56,279
Yes, uh, I'm still here.

591
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:58,455
Um, I'm ju...

592
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:00,326
Do you, uh...

593
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,110
Do you need to get that?

594
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:03,547
What?

595
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,549
Do you need to help the baby?

596
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,030
No, that's my friend's baby.
I'm just watching it.

597
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,858
Listen, I really didn't mean
to bother you.

598
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,817
I mean, if you're not happy
to hear from me,

599
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,428
- I can call somebody else.
- No, no. I'm happy.

600
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:18,692
I just wish that you
had called sooner.

601
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,955
Fatima came back.

602
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,219
Who?

603
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:25,003
My fiancée.

604
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:27,353
I mean... my wife.

605
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:30,661
My fiancée became my wife.

606
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:32,489
Right. Yeah.
I know, that's how it happens.

607
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:34,099
- Okay. Bye, Stephen.
- If you...

608
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:50,158
So, your last job was in 2008?

609
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,031
Yes. But it's not like I was...

610
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,902
I mean, I had a baby.

611
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,774
So, I was busy doing that.

612
00:33:58,515 --> 00:34:00,081
A year of waitressing.

613
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,606
Did you graduate high school?

614
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,783
Oh, I see here
you got your GED.

615
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:10,701
Five years
at Sin City Cabaret.

616
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:14,400
- What did you do there, exactly?
- Bartending, mostly.

617
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,012
And what about at Moves?

618
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:19,318
Bartending, mostly.

619
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:23,322
So you really don't have
any retail experience.

620
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,063
No, not yet.

621
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,283
But that's why I'd really like
to get retail experience

622
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:28,806
because then I would have it.

623
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,114
We're really looking for
someone with retail experience.

624
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,772
Well, how am I supposed to get retail
experience without retail experience?

625
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,166
I mean, I sold beer.
What's the difference?

626
00:34:48,391 --> 00:34:50,567
Baby, come here.

627
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:52,569
Did Nana fall asleep?

628
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,658
There we go.

629
00:34:55,746 --> 00:34:56,747
Are you okay?

630
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,510
You're in my seat.

631
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,163
I'm so sorry.

632
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:30,476
You're so pretty.

633
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:46,971
Another Red Bull?

634
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,277
Mom!

635
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,498
Hey! Welcome back, sweetie.

636
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:54,195
- They have you up front now?
- Yup.

637
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,893
What the hell happened
to this place?

638
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:57,373
2008 happened.

639
00:35:57,547 --> 00:35:59,070
The guys
don't wanna spend money.

640
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,072
The girls
don't wanna share tips.

641
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,770
Management has taken the cameras
out of the Champagne Room.

642
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,469
And I'm up front
in customer service.

643
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,471
Yes, I see you. Hello.

644
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:09,646
Another Red Bull?

645
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,822
Who are these girls?

646
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,519
Russians, mostly.

647
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:15,565
They look like models.

648
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:18,568
They're giving blow jobs
for $300 a pop.

649
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,986
Yeah? What else you got?

650
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,383
Come on. Don't be a tease.
Are you a tease?

651
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,603
Feel how hard you make me.

652
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,563
We're not supposed to do that.

653
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,130
Oh, come on. Just stroke it.

654
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:02,089
I'll give you $100.

655
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,571
A hundred. One hundred.

656
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:07,573
Please.

657
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:10,663
Here.

658
00:37:11,534 --> 00:37:12,578
Three hundred.

659
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,319
Pretty please.

660
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,190
Just for a minute. Come on.

661
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,193
Hey. We'll make
each other feel good.

662
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,034
All right.

663
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:44,088
When I got off the floor,
I saw that he gave me three 20s.

664
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,229
You don't have to believe me.

665
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:58,755
I'm used to people
not believing me.

666
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:05,239
I just wanted to tell you so that you
know where my head was at when I saw her.

667
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,218
Whoa.

668
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,704
- Oh, my God.
- There's no way.

669
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,837
Oh, my God,
she's fucking gorgeous.

670
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:40,318
Of course.

671
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,537
How old is she now?

672
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,103
Two and a half.

673
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:46,367
There's nothing like it,
is there?

674
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:50,197
Juliet still lets me sleep
in her bed.

675
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,199
But I just know she's gonna
throw me out any day now.

676
00:38:57,161 --> 00:38:58,945
I missed you, you know that?

677
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:01,774
I missed you, too.

678
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:06,605
Where'd you go, baby?

679
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:14,526
What happened with Johnny?

680
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,229
Why didn't you call me?

681
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,190
You know that you and Lily can
always stay with me and Juju.

682
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,106
You know that.
No, don't do that. Come on.

683
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,890
No. Don't do that thing.

684
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:33,632
Don't do that.

685
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,679
It's me.

686
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:39,812
Hey.

687
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:43,990
You remember
what we were like back then?

688
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,558
Remember?

689
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:48,429
We were like
fucking hurricanes.

690
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:50,214
Weren't we?

691
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:57,090
I just need to make money
right now, though, you know?

692
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,876
I just wanna, like, be independent.
Not need anybody.

693
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,573
Just me and Lily. That's it.

694
00:40:03,227 --> 00:40:05,446
She told me
what happened after the crash.

695
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:12,149
With half of Wall Street unemployed,
the club wasn't far behind.

696
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:17,633
Mercedes got Ramona
a job in fashion.

697
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,765
I can't believe
he got arrested.

698
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:21,898
What am I supposed to do now?
I can't afford no lawyer.

699
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:24,030
I can barely afford
his half of the rent.

700
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:28,687
It's almost enough to make me
just call off the wedding.

701
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,210
Well?

702
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,779
I mean, come on, Sadie.
And you know I love Dragon.

703
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:36,739
But do you really wanna marry someone
who's probably going to prison?

704
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:39,480
I don't know.

705
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,309
Three to five
is a big commitment.

706
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:48,228
- Hey, Mark.
- Hey, what's up?

707
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:51,536
I was hoping you wouldn't mind
if I ducked out early on Fridays

708
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,972
to pick up my kid from school.

709
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,931
She has half days
for the rest of the year.

710
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,107
Rest of the year? No.

711
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,414
No, no. No, the rest
of the school year.

712
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,727
No.

713
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,816
Well, what if I got somebody
to cover my shift?

714
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,079
- Mercedes said that she could probably...
- Oh, my God. Come on.

715
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,473
Took me forever to figure out
everyone's stupid schedules.

716
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,257
- I know, Mark. But...
- I mean, really?

717
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,869
Please. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't for my kid. Okay?

718
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:22,654
She's going through
this difficult time at school.

719
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,003
She's at that difficult age.

720
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:25,222
Am I the father?

721
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,530
- What?
- Am I the father?

722
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:33,621
No.

723
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:35,667
'Kay. Then why
should I give a shit? Right?

724
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:39,671
Don't she got a babysitter
or a nanny or something?

725
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:42,761
I can't afford that.

726
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,981
Well, you know, if you
were putting in more hours

727
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:47,200
instead of racing outta here
all the time...

728
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:49,333
Right? More hours, more money.

729
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,988
More money, a babysitter.
Problem solved.

730
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:54,730
Craig's got two kids.

731
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:57,036
You don't see him rushing home every
time someone's got a nosebleed.

732
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,778
He's here, he's doing his shifts.
I can't do it.

00:42:01,998 --> 00:42:06,393

734
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:13,661

Yeah.

No offense,

There you go.

742
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:51,525
Gonna have to dig this thing out
of there later, but...

743
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:52,875
Where'd you learn that?

744
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:55,834
Just some old...

745
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,794
What? Don't you have sisters?

746
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:06,889
No, my brothers
don't talk to me anymore.

747
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:12,938
I told my mom and dad that I worked here,
and they kicked me out of the house.

748
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,992
Wanna go fishing?

749
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,125
What's fishing?

750
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,870
Since the crash,
the club needs customers.

751
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,829
All we gotta do
is reel 'em in.

752
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,702
Look,
anyone can own one nice suit.

753
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:43,055
You wanna look at their shoes,
their watches, briefcases...

754
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,710
their wedding rings.

755
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:48,104
Always look for
a wedding ring.

756
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,758
Jimmy,
another Glenmorangie.

757
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:54,110
Once you got 'em on the
hook, that's when we get the net.

758
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:56,025
Bring out the flavor.

759
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,592
Spencer,
these are my co-workers.

760
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:01,987
What are we cheersing today?

761
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:03,597
To life. Cheers. Whoo!

762
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:05,121
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

763
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:12,563
- Ho-ho. What do we got there?
- You want some of that?

764
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:14,173
A little
Colombian marching powder?

765
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:15,871
Let me show you how it's done.

766
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,351
There you go.

767
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,962
You know what we should do?
We should go to a club.

768
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:21,615
We should go
to the strip club.

769
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:23,617
I don't know.
I don't know.

770
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,576
- Come on.
- It's naughty.

771
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,839
Tomorrow we'll be
at our desks at 9 a.m.,

772
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:30,276
regretting the moment that we could've
gone to a strip club together.

773
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,974
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

774
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:33,062
I'm in.

775
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:36,804
Then we
steer him to the club...

776
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:38,894
- Need a ride, baby?
- Oh, yes, I do.

777
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:41,897
Get in.

778
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:47,728
...where we've negotiated
ourselves a percentage of his spending.

779
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:52,168
And then we run up his credit
card as far as we can push it.

780
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:55,040
Easy breezy.

781
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:57,347
Another round.

782
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:07,183
- Yaas.
- Yaas. Yeah!

783
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,751
No problem.

784
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:12,362
There we go.

785
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:13,667
- No problem.
- No problem.

786
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:14,538
Okay, you got this.

787
00:45:15,104 --> 00:45:16,670
- Hey!
- Yeah, Spencer.

788
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,585
Tell the nice man
where you live.

789
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:19,804
New York!

790
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,980
Little more specific, baby.

791
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:23,373
Fifth Avenue.

792
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:24,548
Close enough.

793
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:27,029
Hey.

794
00:45:27,203 --> 00:45:27,986
- Bye, Spencer!
- Goodbye!

795
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,466
- Bye!
- Bye!

796
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,340
But like Ramona said,

797
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:36,299
"Going fishing doesn't mean
you catch a marlin."

798
00:45:41,957 --> 00:45:43,523
And some of the guys
didn't want to party.

799
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:45,395
Oh, no. No, thank you.

800
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:47,136
Come on. You don't...

801
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,659
- Are you sure? Come on.
- I'm very sure. Thank you.

802
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,313
You don't wanna see me
after a couple of those.

803
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:51,749
Oh, boy.

804
00:45:51,923 --> 00:45:53,272
And some of them caught on.

805
00:45:53,446 --> 00:45:55,535
- I can't, but this was fun.
- What? Wait.

806
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:01,019
Fuck.

807
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,108
What do we do now?

808
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:05,023
I'm supposed to get Dragon
a new lawyer.

809
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:07,069
But I can't
fucking afford it now.

810
00:46:10,594 --> 00:46:11,812
I can't move back home.

811
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:14,859
I guess it's back to the pole.

812
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,342
Sorry, Annabelle.
We'll get through it.

813
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:21,561
That's when Ramona
came up with her special recipe.

814
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:24,390
Are you serious?

815
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,871
It's barely any different
than what we're doing now.

816
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:28,829
It's just a shortcut.

817
00:46:29,004 --> 00:46:30,179
A sure thing.

818
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,008
- What if someone gets hurt?
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

819
00:46:33,182 --> 00:46:35,140
The worst is
they'll have a bad hangover.

820
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:37,273
- What if somebody calls the cops?
- And says what?

821
00:46:37,447 --> 00:46:40,841
"I spent $5,000
at a strip club. Send help"?

822
00:46:41,016 --> 00:46:44,497
No. They won't even know what happened
until they check their bank account.

823
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:45,716
I think I'm gonna throw up.

824
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:48,110
Look, we're not
the only ones doing this.

825
00:46:48,284 --> 00:46:51,069
How do you think the club
stayed in business post-2008?

826
00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:53,637
It's a side hustle.

827
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,379
Everybody's had to
get creative, baby.

828
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:00,992
I know a girl in Queens
who did it.

829
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:02,602
Did she get caught?

830
00:47:02,776 --> 00:47:04,082
No.

831
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:05,562
She sent her two kids
to college.

832
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:07,433
And now she lives in Miami.
Opened up a nail salon.

833
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:08,608
Exactly.

834
00:47:13,135 --> 00:47:14,179
What do you think?

835
00:47:16,747 --> 00:47:17,748
What is it?

836
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,751
It's ketamine and MDMA.

837
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:24,015
The ketamine wipes their memory,
the MDMA makes 'em happy.

838
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,886
How many times
have you done it?

839
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:28,585
Three times.
Including tonight.

840
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,021
Works every time.

841
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,764
We made five grand tonight,
split three ways.

842
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:38,682
Could make it four.

843
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,598
Be like old times.

844
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:50,607
Look, baby, we gotta start thinking
like these Wall Street guys.

845
00:47:51,434 --> 00:47:53,000
You see what they did
to this country?

846
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,699
They stole from everybody.

847
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,744
Hardworking people
lost everything.

848
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,747
And not one of
these douchebags went to jail.

849
00:48:01,357 --> 00:48:02,401
Not one.

850
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,055
Is that fair?

851
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:07,058
You ever think about
when they come into the club?

852
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:08,320
That's stolen money.

853
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:11,106
That's what's paying for
their blow jobs.

854
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,369
The fucking firefighters'
retirement fund.

855
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:15,371
Fuck these guys.

856
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:24,641
Look, we can't dance forever.

857
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,079
What are you gonna do?
Go back to minimum wage?

858
00:48:30,473 --> 00:48:32,344
No, baby, this game is rigged.

859
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:36,479
And it does not reward people
who play by the rules.

860
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:39,395
You either gotta stand in
the corner or get in the ring.

861
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,313
I don't wanna hurt anybody.

862
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:45,488
Me either.

863
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:47,751
All right?

864
00:48:48,665 --> 00:48:50,014
They would do this anyway.

865
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:53,191
We're just helping them do it.

866
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,412
Nobody gets hurt.

867
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:58,979
Nobody gets hurt.

868
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:01,721
So...

869
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:04,550
are you in?

870
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,122
Well, it's getting late.

871
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,603
Oh, it is? What a shame.

872
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:16,171
So, you gotta get up
early tomorrow, or...

873
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,435
Let's get another drink. Hmm?

874
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,047
Hey, these are my sisters.

875
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,400
- Hi, sweetie!
- Hi!

876
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,794
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

877
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,099
- Hi.
- Ramona.

878
00:49:32,274 --> 00:49:33,405
- I'm Gary.
- Gary, nice to meet you.

879
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:34,754
- Nice to meet you.
- Annabelle.

880
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,452
- Hi, Annabelle.
- Isn't he so cute?

881
00:49:36,626 --> 00:49:37,714
Yes.

882
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:39,498
- I'm Destiny.
- Hi, Destiny.

883
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,066
Can I have three shots?

884
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,155
You know who he looks like,
don't you?

885
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:45,809
He looks like Tom Cruise.
Right?

886
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,767
- No, no. I'm thinking more smooth.
- Tom Cruise.

887
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:49,334
- It's the hair.
- Tom Cruise? I don't know about that.

888
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:50,727
I know!

889
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:51,858
- No.
- It's your smile.

890
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,556
It is.

891
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,731
- It's really good.
- A mini Bob Saget.

892
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:55,906
- Getting more Sonny.
- Yeah!

893
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,473
Sonny Bono?

894
00:49:57,647 --> 00:49:58,909
He's got
the twinkle in his eye.

895
00:49:59,083 --> 00:49:59,823
- I know!
- Here we go, guys.

896
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,477
This wine yours?

897
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:03,087
- Yes, that's it. No, this is mine.
- Okay, cool.

898
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:04,567
- All right, thanks.
- Shots, ladies?

899
00:50:04,741 --> 00:50:05,785
- Okay. Yes.
- Yes.

900
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:07,134
You guys are sisters?

901
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:08,745
Yeah. Same dad,
different moms.

902
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:09,833
To sisters!

903
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,617
To sisters.

904
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,053
To sisters.

905
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,071
Just put him here right now.

906
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:32,769
He dead?

907
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:35,337
- Oh, shit. We going to jail.
- Damn. -

908
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:37,295
- Oh, my God.
- Help her.

909
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,123
- Oh, my God.
- Does this always happen?

910
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:40,994
No.

911
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:42,518
- Did we give him too much?
- I don't know.

912
00:50:42,692 --> 00:50:45,172
Gary. Gary. Baby.

913
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:47,087
Gary, wake up. Wake up, Gary.

914
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,307
- Gary.
- Oh, Gary.

915
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,048
- Open your eyes.
- We love you, Gary.

916
00:50:51,222 --> 00:50:52,702
- Gary! Wake up, Gary.
- Fuck.

917
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:54,269
Open your eyes, baby.

918
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:56,009
- Wake up, Gary! Wake up!
- Open your eyes.

919
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,664
There you go.

920
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:00,100
What was that, Gary?

921
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:02,451
- Another round, Gary?
- What are we gonna do?

922
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:05,062
What do you want?
Isn't this fun?

923
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:08,065
- Uh.
- That's it, baby.

924
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:09,240
That's it, Gary.

925
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:10,589
Come on. Yeah, Gary.

926
00:51:10,763 --> 00:51:12,461
That's it, baby. Get it.

927
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:14,332
- There you go.
- Come on.

928
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:15,420
This one right here?
There you go.

929
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:18,031
- You can do it.
- Come on. Come on.

930
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:19,424
What do you want, baby?

931
00:51:19,598 --> 00:51:20,991
Which one is it? That one?

932
00:51:21,557 --> 00:51:22,601
You need help?

933
00:51:23,385 --> 00:51:26,301
This one? That pretty
gold one right here?

934
00:51:26,475 --> 00:51:28,390
That's the one?

935
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:32,350
Wow. Oh, my...

936
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:45,145
To Gary!

937
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,321
Yes!

938
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:52,762
The worst are the guys who go to
the bathroom and put on a condom,

939
00:51:52,936 --> 00:51:56,896
and then you know
you got to grind it out.

940
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,289
So disgusting.

941
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:00,247
We don't have to go back.
Do we?

942
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:03,033
- Do we have to go back?
- No, baby. Your dancing days are over.

943
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,730
- Yeah?
- You guys,

944
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:07,080
- I can pay off my grandma's house.
- Yeah!

945
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:09,561
- I'm getting myself a new engagement ring.
- That's so sweet.

946
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:12,303
And Dragon's ass can stay in
jail for a few more weeks.

947
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:14,305
Or a month. Or a year.

948
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:16,002
- To Gary.
- To Gary!

949
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:17,264
- To Gary.
- I love Gary.

950
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:18,657
- God bless Gary.
- To Gary.

951
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:19,789
- I love you, Gary!
- To Gary.

952
00:52:19,963 --> 00:52:21,617
- I love you, Gary.
- Mom?

953
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,793
Hi, baby.

954
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:26,143
Hi, what happened?
Who woke you up?

955
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:28,275
Who was it?
Some crazy lady woke you up?

956
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,494
What happened?

957
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:33,411
You guys are my real sisters.

958
00:52:33,585 --> 00:52:35,370
- I love you like you're my sisters.
- Yeah. Sisters.

959
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:36,675
- I love you.
- I love you.

960
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:37,894
Love you.

961
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:40,505
- You know I love you though.
- Yes.

962
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:41,593
We are a family now.

963
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:42,507
Yeah.

964
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:44,988
A family with money!

965
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,033
Yeah!

966
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,298
What are we gonna do? We're gonna
go shopping tomorrow? Yes, we are!

967
00:52:56,652 --> 00:52:58,871
Hit the Electric Slide.

968
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:02,266
Okay. I know it sounds bad
to say that we were drugging people.

969
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:06,357
But you gotta understand,
in our world, this was normal.

970
00:53:06,531 --> 00:53:09,708
I mean, half these guys are
mainlining coke on their way to work.

971
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:12,363
But we still wanted to make it
as safe as possible.

972
00:53:12,537 --> 00:53:14,887
So, I suggested
that we tweak the recipe.

973
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:18,108
So, what do you think?
Sixty MDMA, forty ketamine?

974
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:23,330
That sounds good.

975
00:53:23,505 --> 00:53:26,769
Do we turn the liquid into a powder?
Or do we turn the powder into a liquid?

976
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:39,738
It's hot.

977
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:47,354
Eh, eh, eh.

978
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,952
Let's try it in the oven.

979
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:24,348
Mm-hmm.

980
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:27,438
Yes.

981
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,355
How much?

982
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:34,967
Just a sprinkle.

983
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,756
You know, I'm still not sure
about strangers.

984
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,759
Well, that's the beauty of it,
baby, they're strangers.

985
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:48,067
Yeah, but I don't wanna slip it to
anybody who's not already on something.

986
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:50,635
We gotta know that
these guys like to party.

987
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:52,202
And that they've got money.

988
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,813
Enough not to care
if some of it's missing.

989
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:57,076
With strangers,
it's unpredictable.

990
00:54:57,642 --> 00:54:58,774
No guarantees.

991
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,777
So, we called up
some old friends.

992
00:55:05,694 --> 00:55:06,651
Okay.

993
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,784
David, is that you?

994
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,134
It's Ramona.

995
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,831
Get some.

996
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,180
Well, I can send you
a picture to jog your memory.

997
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:16,052
Okay, I'll send it right now.

998
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:18,924
Come on.
Come on, give it to me.

999
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:21,710
No. Turn around.
You know what they want.

1000
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,407
- You're into that good time.
- It's a sure thing.

1001
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:25,322
That's good.
That's a good angle.

1002
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,151
- My baby.
- Now we wait.

1003
00:55:28,804 --> 00:55:30,022
You killed it.

1004
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:34,026
Uh...

1005
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:37,290
This was too fucking easy.

1006
00:55:38,683 --> 00:55:40,250
Hi, David.

1007
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:42,121
Yeah, I can bring
some of my friends.

1008
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,778
David, these are my sisters.

1009
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:51,478
Hi.

1010
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:53,132
Annabelle.

1011
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:54,656
- David. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1012
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,614
- David.
- David. Nice to meet you.

1013
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:58,311
Mercedes. Like the car.

1014
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:00,183
Mercedes, how are you?

1015
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:01,619
- We should get some drinks.
- Ooh, yes.

1016
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,447

1031
00:56:54,846 --> 00:56:56,935
Too much, bitch.

1032
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:04,856
Let me see,
let's do number four.

1033
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:10,949
It says, "The brain evaluates
data collected from weather..."

1034
00:57:11,123 --> 00:57:12,168
Mercedes.

1035
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,386
So good to see you.

1036
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,301
Dragon's gonna be okay.

1037
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:31,143
Maybe one of 'em would call
and complain, but we could handle it.

1038
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:34,059
What are you talking about?
You had an amazing time.

1039
00:57:34,233 --> 00:57:35,495
You were so happy.

1040
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,236
You kept tipping everybody,
remember?

1041
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:38,977
Ramona could always handle it.

1042
00:57:39,674 --> 00:57:41,763
What are you gonna do?
Call the police?

1043
00:57:41,937 --> 00:57:44,417
You really gonna tell your wife
and the police what you did?

1044
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,898
You think that's worth
whatever amount you're missing?

1045
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,466
No, you went out.
You had an epic night.

1046
00:57:49,945 --> 00:57:51,076
It costs money.

1047
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:53,078
Why should it cost you
any more than that?

1048
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:54,993
Too cute.

1049
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,996
We treated it like a business.

1050
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,912
So, we'll have Annabelle meet J.P.
Morgan and Mercedes meet Wells Fargo.

1051
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:03,393
Mercedes met Wells Fargo
last time.

1052
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,612
How much did we
charge last time?

1053
00:58:05,787 --> 00:58:08,485
$5,000 on his American Express
and $2,000 on his corporate card.

1054
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:11,401
Does he have
any airline miles?

1055
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:13,446
- Let's check.
- Worth a look.

1056
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:15,318
We invested in ourselves.

1057
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,320
- Yes.
- Ooh.

1058
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,887
The dolls are here!

1059
00:58:19,061 --> 00:58:20,366
Do I look expensive?

1060
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,325
You look very expensive.
And baby got back.

1061
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,283
That dress is hugging you
in all the right places.

1062
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:25,981
We expanded our clientele.

1063
00:58:26,155 --> 00:58:27,765
What did you say
that you did again?

1064
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:29,071
I am an architect.

1065
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:31,029
Oh.

1066
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:35,120
- No wonder your hands are so... nice.
- Strong hands.

1067
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:37,906
But the bigger the bank
account, the greater the expectations.

1068
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,995
Let's go fuck in the bathroom.

1069
00:58:40,169 --> 00:58:42,693
Uh, my sisters are gonna
be here in a couple minutes.

1070
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:44,477
Let's just wait
for them, okay?

1071
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:46,392
All right. Tick tock.

1072
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,003
The guys were getting
more and more aggressive,

1073
00:58:48,177 --> 00:58:49,918
and the four of us
could only take on so much.

1074
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:51,006
So, that's when I said...

1075
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,572
We need to be outsourcing.

1076
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,011
Let's put an ad in Craigslist.

1077
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:58,317
So, we put an ad
in Craigslist.

1078
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:04,933
Does anybody have
any allergies?

1079
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,718
And by this, I mean
really serious allergies.

1080
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:10,590
Like, life-threatening
allergies. Yeah?

1081
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:12,201
I have asthma.

1082
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:13,985
- All right.
- I don't like feet.

1083
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:16,205
You have a foot allergy?

1084
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:19,817
No. I'm just saying if a foot
goes near my face, I'll shut down.

1085
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,993
- I don't mind feet.
- Okay.

1086
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:26,215
Now, we're gonna work on our fake
sniffing and our fake drinking.

1087
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:28,783
- Where were you?
- They had an Orange Julius.

1088
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:31,437
All right. That's good.
That's better with the nail.

1089
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:32,743
What's Coco doing here?

1090
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:34,527
We said no junkies
and no criminals.

1091
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:35,964
So?

1092
00:59:36,138 --> 00:59:37,879
So, she's a junkie
and a criminal.

1093
00:59:38,053 --> 00:59:40,098
- People change.
- I'm not entirely convinced.

1094
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:43,188
Hon, you're not...

1095
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:46,061
Fine. But I promised
I'd buy her lunch.

1096
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:49,107
Oh!

1097
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,631
Who is this? What are you
doing at the mall?

1098
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:53,024
This is Mr. Bruce.

1099
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,461
Mr. Brucey!

1100
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,507
I take him everywhere with me.
I hope that's not a problem.

1101
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,726
Not at all. Not at all.

1102
01:00:21,052 --> 01:00:23,533
Oh, my God! Hi!

1103
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,796
- Look at these fucking bags, bitch.
- Let me see!

1104
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,580
- Take this bag in, bitch.
- Yes!

1105
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:29,713
No drinking, no drugs.

1106
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:32,237

Well, you always said
you wanted real pearls.

1178
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:48,189
Did you go to the bottom
of the ocean for this?

1179
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:49,538
Yeah. Something like that.

No.

Okay.
I have something for you.

1204
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,461

Okay.

1206
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,509
- Wow, it's heavy.
- Yeah.

1207
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:51,034
Okay. What do we got?

1208
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:52,688
- Open it up.
- It's a big one.

1209
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:55,386
Oh, my Lord.

1210
01:05:58,302 --> 01:05:59,347
What was it?

1211
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:01,175
- Chinchilla.
- Oh, my God.

1212
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:04,917
Oh, my God!

1213
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:06,876
Yes.

1214
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:08,747
You're the best.

1215
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,012
I'm so proud of you.

1216
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:17,234
- We don't need anybody else, do we?
- Mm-mm.

1217
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:18,844
- Nobody.
- No.

1218
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:20,455
We're the untouchables.

1219
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:21,934
Like Kobe and Shaq.

1220
01:06:23,371 --> 01:06:24,415
Who gets to be Kobe?

1221
01:06:24,589 --> 01:06:26,025
- I'm Kobe. You're Shaq.
- I'm the Kobe.

1222
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,202
- No. I don't wanna be Shaq.
- No.

1223
01:06:28,376 --> 01:06:30,378
How are you Kobe when there can
only be one Kobe? And I'm the Kobe!

1224
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:32,075
- Double Kobe!
- I'm the Kobe!

1225
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,556
Okay, everybody.

1226
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,297
Come on. Get on top of
each other. Get together.

1227
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:38,473
Come on.

1228
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:40,301
Get close. Get cozy.

1229
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:42,041
- I wanna get in the middle.
- In, in.

1230
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:45,523
Now say money!

1231
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:46,742
Money!

1232
01:06:49,658 --> 01:06:52,791
And, God, thank you for
everything that you've given us.

1233
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:54,489
This delicious food.

1234
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:57,274
My new Louboutins.

1235
01:06:57,448 --> 01:06:59,537
And... for this family.

1236
01:07:00,408 --> 01:07:01,844
My sisters.

1237
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,194
We are so blessed.

1238
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:06,196
Amen.

1239
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:09,504
- Amen.
- Amen.

1240
01:07:16,772 --> 01:07:18,295
Try some of this pork, baby.

1241
01:07:26,172 --> 01:07:28,174
I don't usually get
nervous around these types.

1242
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:29,915
No, you're good.

1243
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:31,526
No, they come
into the club all the time.

1244
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,267
But I had a crush on this guy
since I was 15.

1245
01:07:33,441 --> 01:07:36,008
So, I was like, "Oh, my God."
And suddenly, he's there.

1246
01:07:36,182 --> 01:07:37,880
Nan, do you know who he is?

1247
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,664
You know. You must've
seen him in Us Weekly.

1248
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:41,623
She knows who he is.
Nan, you know who he is.

1249
01:07:41,797 --> 01:07:43,102
The guy from the movies.

1250
01:07:43,277 --> 01:07:44,582
I've seen him.

1251
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,367
He's very good-looking.

1252
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,717
Yeah!

1253
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:50,414
Well, let me tell you something: he's
even more good-looking in person.

1254
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,024
I am telling you.

1255
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:54,810
Anyway, so he picks me up
in this white Porsche.

1256
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:56,377
- No way.
- Yeah.

1257
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:58,204
And all he tells me
is to wear a hat.

1258
01:07:58,379 --> 01:08:00,729
- Fucking Kentucky Derby.
- Yes! That's what I thought!

1259
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:02,731
- That's what it was, right?
- That's what I thought.

1260
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:04,428
That's what I thought.

1261
01:08:04,602 --> 01:08:06,212
But then, all of a sudden,
we're at the airport.

1262
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:08,171
We're boarding
this private jet

1263
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:09,651
- to Monaco.
- Oh, my God.

1264
01:08:09,825 --> 01:08:11,827
There was champagne,
lobster, a butler.

1265
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:15,526
And I just didn't have the heart
to tell him, like, I hate flying.

1266
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:21,402
So, there I am in this gorgeous marble
bathroom, 10,000 feet in the air,

1267
01:08:21,576 --> 01:08:22,925
vomiting lobster
and champagne.

1268
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,059
Sit here, baby. You know,
Annabelle can vomit on cue.

1269
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:29,627
- It's one of her many gifts.
- It's not intentional.

1270
01:08:29,801 --> 01:08:31,629
- -
You're so good though, baby.

1271
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:35,241
So, thank God,
finally, this plane lands.

1272
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:40,334
And we proceed to have three of the most
amazing hours I have ever had in my life.

1273
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:43,293
Until the paparazzi shows up,
ruins everything.

1274
01:08:43,467 --> 01:08:44,599
And I have to say:

1275
01:08:45,426 --> 01:08:47,819
That's the end of the PG-13
version of this story.

1276
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:50,300
- Ooh!
- Oh, no. You gotta give us more. Come on.

1277
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:51,997
Details, please. Tease, baby.

1278
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:55,218
I once danced
with Frankie Valli.

1279
01:08:55,523 --> 01:08:57,394
What? Nana.

1280
01:08:57,786 --> 01:09:01,093
- Did... Did you know this?
- No. What?

1281
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:03,182
It was before he got married.

1282
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:04,923
The second time.

1283
01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:06,621
I don't know, Nan.

1284
01:09:06,795 --> 01:09:09,275
I don't know about that.
Are you sure?

1285
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,668
Pretty sure.

1286
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:12,540
You're not really sure.

1287
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:15,064
My God, this woman
is my spirit animal!

1288
01:09:29,905 --> 01:09:32,037
♪ Rag doll, ooh ♪

1289
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:37,129
Okay, Nan.

1290
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:40,045
All right. Tell the truth.

1291
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:44,746
Frankie Valli shows up on your
doorstep on your wedding day.

1292
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,966
And he says,
"Me or your husband."

1293
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,751
What do you say?

1294
01:09:51,013 --> 01:09:52,449
"Which car do you drive?"

1295
01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:55,844
How have we not met sooner?

1296
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:57,802
How have we not met sooner?

1297
01:09:57,976 --> 01:09:59,543
How have we not met sooner?

1298
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:01,371
Oh, my God.

1299
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,032
So, getting back
to the drugging.

1300
01:10:12,164 --> 01:10:13,862
Is that
what you're hung up on?

1301
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:15,646
It's hard not to be.

1302
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:20,434
What'd you say
your name was again?

1303
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:22,392
Elizabeth.

1304
01:10:22,566 --> 01:10:24,350
And did you grow up
with money, Elizabeth?

1305
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,832
We were... comfortable.

1306
01:10:28,006 --> 01:10:29,399
So, what did your parents do?

1307
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:30,487
My dad was a journalist.

1308
01:10:30,661 --> 01:10:32,271
My mom's a psychiatrist.

1309
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:34,360
And where'd you go to school?

1310
01:10:35,623 --> 01:10:37,276
Brown. For undergrad.

1311
01:10:37,451 --> 01:10:39,540
What would you do for $1,000?

1312
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:45,371
Of course, the answer is gonna depend on
what you already have and what you need.

1313
01:10:47,069 --> 01:10:48,505
- So, the...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1314
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,028
I don't think I should
even talk to you anymore.

1315
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,424
It's just, I don't know you.

1316
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:57,645
And I'm sorry, these girls are
just like my sisters, so...

1317
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:00,212
That's okay. I understand.

1318
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:03,302
Ramona said the same thing.

1319
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:06,218
You talked to Ramona?

1320
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:07,437
Yeah.

1321
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:09,570
When?

1322
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:10,832
Yesterday.

1323
01:11:11,006 --> 01:11:11,920
Where?

1324
01:11:12,094 --> 01:11:13,269
I went to her work.

1325
01:11:17,926 --> 01:11:18,927
What?

1326
01:11:20,798 --> 01:11:22,626
Oh, nothing. It's just...

1327
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:26,151
the idea of Ramona Vega
trying to go straight.

1328
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:27,457
That's like...

1329
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,421
Well, I mean, if you talked to her,
what do you need to talk to me for?

1330
01:11:36,684 --> 01:11:40,165
I was just hoping that you could
fill in some of the blanks.

1331
01:11:40,949 --> 01:11:42,037
"Blanks"?

1332
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:46,258
Okay.

1333
01:11:46,955 --> 01:11:47,956
Where was I?

1334
01:11:52,787 --> 01:11:55,964
Fucking copycats.

1335
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,665
Look, I don't think
we need 'em anymore.

1336
01:12:01,839 --> 01:12:02,840
Need who?

1337
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:04,494
The club.

1338
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:08,759
Why should we split anything
when we can have it all?

1339
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:14,504
After she cut out the club,
we had to meet our clients in hotel rooms.

1340
01:12:14,678 --> 01:12:16,767
- Or in their homes upstate.
- Where the fuck are they?

1341
01:12:16,941 --> 01:12:18,421
Annabelle's feeling
grossed-out lately.

1342
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:20,162
A lot of the girls
stopped showing up.

1343
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,468
And what about Mercedes?
Is she feeling "grossed-out"?

1344
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:25,602
We can't keep giving them their cut if
they're not showing up for weeks on end.

1345
01:12:27,996 --> 01:12:29,998
We need a bigger crew.
I'm gonna call Coco.

1346
01:12:30,172 --> 01:12:32,043
No! She's a junkie.

1347
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,350
Fine.
What about Georgia?

1348
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:35,743
She just got out of jail.

1349
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:36,700
Trixie?

1350
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:38,093
She's still in jail.

1351
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:40,878
Ramona,
quit bringing home strays.

1352
01:12:41,052 --> 01:12:43,707
We're breaking the law here.
We don't wanna work with criminals.

1353
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:46,623
I didn't know how much I love
red hair until I saw you standing there.

1354
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:49,321
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- So amazing.

1355
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:50,671
- I wish it was natural.
- I might dye my hair.

1356
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:53,108
Hey, Dorothy. This is Dawn.

1357
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:54,675
Hi.

1358
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,200
♪ Pretty as
A midsummer's morn ♪

1359
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:02,247
♪ They call her Dawn ♪

1360
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:04,162
As soon as I saw her, I said,

1361
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:07,992
"Oh, my God. You're gorgeous.
You have to join us."

1362
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:10,081
And she said... Tell 'em what you said.

1363
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:12,954
I said, "What is it?
Like, a cult?"

1364
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:20,614
It kinda is
a cult. A little bit.

1365
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,007
It's like, if we're a
team, and we're making money,

1366
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:25,270
and we're winning games,

1367
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:28,056
do you suddenly start trading
players and bringing in new people?

1368
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:29,144
No, right?

1369
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:30,972
Think I'm gonna buy these.

1370
01:13:31,146 --> 01:13:32,582
Where the fuck is she?

1371
01:13:32,756 --> 01:13:34,236
Relax. She's a pro.

1372
01:13:36,717 --> 01:13:39,589
Two-four-three-seven.

1373
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,897
Two-four-three-seven.

1374
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:44,855
Two-four-three-seven.

1375
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:47,510
Two-four-three-seven.

1376
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:50,992
Three-seven.

1377
01:13:54,038 --> 01:13:55,866
Yeah.
We can meet at five or six.

1378
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,173
No, six is good.
Six is good.

1379
01:13:58,564 --> 01:13:59,565
You want five?

1380
01:14:00,088 --> 01:14:01,263
- Make a decision.
- Two-four...

1381
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,395
You've got three seconds.
One, two...

1382
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,615
Yeah,
I'm gonna fucking get these!

1383
01:14:06,311 --> 01:14:08,226
Size 8, please, ho.

1384
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:11,447
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Six o' clock or seven?

1385
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:13,362
Two-four-three-seven.

1386
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:17,192
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Hurry the fuck up.

1387
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,542
- Two-four-three-seven.
- Jesus fucking Christ. Come on!

1388
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:22,327
Um, two-four-three-seven.

1389
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,068
Good girl.

1390
01:14:24,678 --> 01:14:26,070
I got you.

1391
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,247
Told you she was a pro.

1392
01:14:29,421 --> 01:14:30,945
Dawn was no pro.

1393
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:33,556
She was a cokehead. A felon.

1394
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:37,212
- She was reckless and sloppy. And stupid.
- With the blue tie?

1395
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:39,780
- She was out of control.
- I don't know. I've never seen him.

1396
01:14:39,954 --> 01:14:43,044
Ramona didn't care, as long as
she was making money.

1397
01:14:43,218 --> 01:14:44,480
What's my credit limit, again?

1398
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,525
$50,000?

1399
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,660
Let's do it for the full 50.

1400
01:14:51,313 --> 01:14:52,923
We're never gonna
see him again.

1401
01:14:53,315 --> 01:14:54,272
Who cares?

1402
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:56,840
Yes. Thank you.

1403
01:14:57,014 --> 01:14:59,625
It wasn't long before
she burned through our regulars,

1404
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,106
which left us with
unpredictable strangers.

1405
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:04,892
- Where is he?
- Out back.

1406
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:10,027
What the fuck happened?

1407
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:11,333
He said
he could dive off the roof.

1408
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,030
And I said he couldn't.

1409
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:14,902
Well, you were right.
Where's Georgia?

1410
01:15:15,076 --> 01:15:16,686
She took off.

1411
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,732
Where the fuck is Ramona?
This is her client!

1412
01:15:18,906 --> 01:15:20,211
I couldn't get in contact
with her.

1413
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:23,214
My God.

1414
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:24,476
All right. Come on.
Help me get his legs.

1415
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:25,869
I... Is he dead?

1416
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,175
Not yet.

1417
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:29,003
We're not gonna kill him,
are we?

1418
01:15:29,177 --> 01:15:30,569
No, we're gonna take him to the hospital.
Come on. Help me.

1419
01:15:30,744 --> 01:15:33,529
- Okay.
- Help me get him. Lift.

1420
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:34,965
What the fuck?

1421
01:15:36,184 --> 01:15:38,142
- You can do it. Come on.
- No, no, no.

1422
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:40,710
Get the door!

1423
01:15:44,758 --> 01:15:46,716
I got him.
I got him.

1424
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,893
Okay. You gotta help me with his torso.
Come on. Careful. Careful.

1425
01:15:50,285 --> 01:15:51,895
- Ready? -
Don't scratch his booty.

1426
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:53,636
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

1427
01:15:54,289 --> 01:15:55,116
Fuck!

1428
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:00,861
God, I'm sorry.

1429
01:16:01,035 --> 01:16:03,428
Okay. Call Ramona and don't
stop calling till you get her.

1430
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:06,040
- Okay.
- I'm gonna fucking kill her.

1431
01:16:09,086 --> 01:16:10,218
Has she texted back yet?

1432
01:16:10,653 --> 01:16:11,785
No.

1433
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,308
Can't believe her.

1434
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:16,180
Hey, slow down. Five-O.

1435
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:23,361
Oh, shit!

1436
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:27,061
Guys. You guys!

1437
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:29,280
- I'm sorry.
- Just chill.

1438
01:16:29,454 --> 01:16:31,761
- Stay cool.
- I am.

1439
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,591
Oh, my God.

1440
01:16:55,263 --> 01:16:56,960
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- No, that's fine.

1441
01:16:58,048 --> 01:16:59,528
I don't know
why that happens.

1442
01:17:10,104 --> 01:17:11,496
Mercedes, come on. Help me.

1443
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:13,847
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1444
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:15,631
Jesus Christ.

1445
01:17:15,805 --> 01:17:17,285
- Help me get him out.
- Where are you taking him?

1446
01:17:17,459 --> 01:17:18,764
We're gonna take him inside.

1447
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:19,809
I thought we was
just gonna leave him here.

1448
01:17:19,983 --> 01:17:21,158
We can't just leave him.

1449
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:22,290
I'm not going inside.

1450
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:23,465
Mercedes, this is a business.

1451
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:24,683
No!

1452
01:17:26,294 --> 01:17:27,469
Mercedes!

1453
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:31,777
Oh, fuck!

1454
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:32,996
Help, please!

1455
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,259
Help! Help!

1456
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:36,521
- Help!
- Here they are.

1457
01:17:36,695 --> 01:17:38,306
Please, help my husband.

1458
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:41,396
Help my husband!

1459
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,528
- All right...
- I'm gonna flip on three.

1460
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:45,226
Please hurry!

1461
01:17:49,578 --> 01:17:51,101
I'll be right back. Come on.

1462
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,117
Lily!

1463
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,077
Lily!

1464
01:18:11,382 --> 01:18:13,689
- Monica!
- Are you still here?

1465
01:18:14,908 --> 01:18:15,821
Lily!

1466
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:17,040
Fuck.

1467
01:18:46,809 --> 01:18:47,853
Come on.

1468
01:18:51,074 --> 01:18:52,510
Oh, my God.

1469
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:54,295
- There's Mommy.
- I'm so sorry.

1470
01:18:54,469 --> 01:18:55,905
- Hi, baby.
- Hi!

1471
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:57,472
you were stealing money.

1472
01:18:57,646 --> 01:18:59,256
That's funny.

1473
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,910
- Hey. The babysitter had to go home.
- Funny.

1474
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:02,694
But we had ourselves
a fun sleepover, didn't we?

1475
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:04,305
- Oh, yeah? I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

1476
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:05,871
Come on, Lily. Here we go.

1477
01:19:08,222 --> 01:19:09,919
- Do you want me to take her?
- No, I got her, Amy. Thanks.

1478
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,270
Sweetie, we're almost there.

1479
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:37,251
Why are we walking
so fast, Mommy?

1480
01:19:51,874 --> 01:19:53,441
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye. Be good.

1481
01:20:03,538 --> 01:20:06,149
So where was Ramona
when I needed her?

1482
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:09,370
Bailing out Dawn again.

1483
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:11,850
Are you kidding me?
Let me buy you lunch, baby.

1484
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:13,852
- Yeah? You're so good to me.
- Yes, of course.

1485
01:20:22,905 --> 01:20:24,994
- Don't ever fucking call me again.
- Baby.

1486
01:20:41,097 --> 01:20:44,753
Come Friday, we're looking at sunny
skies with a high of 78 degrees.

1487
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,886
On the weekend,
we got scattered showers...

1488
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:06,818
I'm sorry
I wasn't there, baby.

1489
01:21:17,046 --> 01:21:18,091
I know.

1490
01:21:28,971 --> 01:21:30,320
I don't wanna go home.

1491
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:34,716
Do you and Lily
wanna stay with us?

1492
01:21:36,544 --> 01:21:37,545
Yeah.

1493
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:39,068
Okay.

1494
01:21:43,594 --> 01:21:47,772
You know, I'm supposed to meet
someone tonight if you wanna join me.

1495
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:50,210
I mean,
take your mind off things.

1496
01:21:52,603 --> 01:21:54,388
Ain't no pressure,
just, you know...

1497
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,087
If you need the money.

1498
01:22:00,611 --> 01:22:02,613
Could be a big one.

1499
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,661
I knew it had to stop.

1500
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:11,100
I kept thinking that there
was, like, this magic number.

1501
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,756
You know,
if I could save enough money,

1502
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,714
I could start clean.

1503
01:22:17,846 --> 01:22:18,847
Just me and Lily.

1504
01:22:20,762 --> 01:22:24,069
Maybe a score so big that
we would never need anybody.

1505
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:26,594
Is that what happened
with Doug ♪♪♪♪?

1506
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:30,554
Uh...

1507
01:22:30,728 --> 01:22:32,165
I don't really remember
a Doug ♪♪♪♪.

1508
01:22:33,035 --> 01:22:35,124
- Ramona said...
- Well, Ramona's a liar.

1509
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:39,476
She'll say anything
to make herself look better.

1510
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,826
I mean,
what did she say about me?

1511
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,524
I'm sure she had a lot to say.

1512
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:45,482
What'd she say?

1513
01:22:46,353 --> 01:22:48,224
She said you had
a tough time growing up

1514
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:50,357
and that you spent
a lot of time alone.

1515
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,795
You got into fights and...

1516
01:22:55,536 --> 01:22:57,755
had some bad boyfriends.

1517
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:00,367
Okay. What else?

1518
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:07,200
That your parents were immigrants,
and that when your father left,

1519
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:10,420
your mother dropped you off
at your grandparents' house.

1520
01:23:12,335 --> 01:23:13,336
And never came back.

1521
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:16,513
Is that true?

1522
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:25,435
I mean, I thought that she was
just taking a break, you know?

1523
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:31,876
I thought that, you know,
sometimes moms need a break.

1524
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:36,098
Why would she tell you all that?

1525
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:40,581
I think she just wanted me
to understand that, for you,

1526
01:23:40,755 --> 01:23:42,800
this wasn't about revenge.

1527
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:46,935
You were just trying
to make friends.

1528
01:23:52,636 --> 01:23:53,768
Destiny.

1529
01:23:56,249 --> 01:23:58,860
I know I'm supposed to think
that what you did was terrible

1530
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,601
and that these guys
didn't deserve it.

1531
01:24:01,689 --> 01:24:04,866
But to tell you the truth,
I don't feel sorry for them.

1532
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:07,782
Well, I feel sorry for them.

1533
01:24:12,787 --> 01:24:14,745
You know,
I keep having this nightmare.

1534
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:18,706
Right? Where, like, I'm in
the back seat of this car.

1535
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,924
This moving car.

1536
01:24:20,882 --> 01:24:25,060
And I realize that nobody
is driving the car.

1537
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,195
And I have to get to the front seat
to try to stop it, and I go there,

1538
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:33,851
and no matter what I do,
I can't get a grip on it.

1539
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:35,897
And I can't, like, stop it.

1540
01:24:36,506 --> 01:24:39,248
And then I wake up.

1541
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:44,688
What happened
between you and Ramona?

1542
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:47,996
Why aren't you
talking anymore?

1543
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:38,873
Hello?

1544
01:25:39,047 --> 01:25:41,266
So Ramona met Doug years ago.

1545
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,661
Doug's friend took him to the
club to blow off some steam

1546
01:25:44,835 --> 01:25:46,533
after a few
devastating events.

1547
01:25:46,707 --> 01:25:48,099
I don't know
that it is gonna be okay.

1548
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:51,364
How could it get worse?

1549
01:25:51,538 --> 01:25:54,323
Which included his
house being destroyed by a fire.

1550
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:59,633
And separating from
the mother of his young son.

1551
01:26:01,765 --> 01:26:04,594
She never really wanted
to have kids, you know?

1552
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:08,772
So, I think when we found out
he was autistic,

1553
01:26:08,946 --> 01:26:11,775
I think she just
couldn't handle it, you know?

1554
01:26:12,254 --> 01:26:13,298
He was nice.

1555
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:16,650
We talked about our kids.
We talked about our exes.

1556
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,956
- We had a heart-to-heart.
- Drinks!

1557
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,525
Here we go.
That one's for you.

1558
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:23,961
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1559
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:25,615
So, what happened to Doug?

1560
01:26:27,356 --> 01:26:30,098
So, what I miss?
What are we doing tonight?

1561
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:32,448
Um...

1562
01:26:32,622 --> 01:26:33,710
Uh...

1563
01:26:34,711 --> 01:26:36,800
The room was round.

1564
01:26:39,847 --> 01:26:42,240
There was a table.

1565
01:26:44,852 --> 01:26:46,854
They maxed out
my corporate card...

1566
01:26:47,855 --> 01:26:51,554
so my company launched
an internal investigation,

1567
01:26:52,163 --> 01:26:53,730
and I was fired.

1568
01:26:54,122 --> 01:26:56,429
Can you please just
credit back my debit card?

1569
01:26:56,603 --> 01:26:58,474
My mortgage payment's
on there.

1570
01:26:59,127 --> 01:27:01,477
What are you talking about?
You were having a great time.

1571
01:27:03,044 --> 01:27:04,698
Why are you doing this to me?

1572
01:27:05,176 --> 01:27:09,877
Please, I have nothing.
I can't...

1573
01:27:10,051 --> 01:27:12,619
I can't afford to not pay
my mortgage.

1574
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:15,926
My s...

1575
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:17,667
My son...

1576
01:27:19,669 --> 01:27:20,757
I'm really sorry.

1577
01:27:21,889 --> 01:27:23,107
Put the phone down, Destiny.

1578
01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:28,591
- Put it away.
- Just give me a second.

1579
01:27:28,765 --> 01:27:30,245
Don't. What the...

1580
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:32,595
- Gimme the phone.
- Get off of me!

1581
01:27:32,769 --> 01:27:34,597
- Hey!
- Stop!

1582
01:27:34,771 --> 01:27:38,209
- If we don't do it, someone else will.
- Get off of me.

1583
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,342
Gimme that fucking phone.

1584
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:45,216
Ungrateful little bitch.

1585
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:20,164
Precinct.

1586
01:28:20,338 --> 01:28:21,688
Yes, hello. I...

1587
01:28:21,862 --> 01:28:23,994
I went to a strip club
and I was drugged.

1588
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:34,048
Precinct.

1589
01:28:34,222 --> 01:28:35,266
I was drugged,
and I have proof.

1590
01:28:37,138 --> 01:28:38,139
It was weird.

1591
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,532
It was real weird.

1592
01:28:39,706 --> 01:28:41,446
If it hadn't been
for the tape,

1593
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:43,448
I would've been like, "Dude,
you're fucking full of shit."

1594
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:46,234
Please.
I just wanna know what happened to me.

1595
01:28:46,408 --> 01:28:48,628
Um...

1596
01:28:48,802 --> 01:28:50,847
You were fleeced, that's all.

1597
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:52,849
By who?

1598
01:28:53,894 --> 01:28:56,505
Um... Well,
we're, like, a little gang.

1599
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,812
You were just a target.

1600
01:28:58,986 --> 01:29:00,814
We just gave you
a little sprinkle.

1601
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,642
I'll tell you everything.

1602
01:29:02,816 --> 01:29:04,861
I'll tell you everything
I know, I promise.

1603
01:29:05,035 --> 01:29:06,602
I know a lot. I really...

1604
01:29:06,776 --> 01:29:08,909
I'll tell you everything.
I just don't wanna go back.

1605
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:10,519
So, was there a sting?

1606
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:11,738
One, two. One, two.

1607
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:13,609
Hello, police.
Can you hear me?

1608
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:15,350
I'm about to open the door.

1609
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,048
- Hey, did you bring the drugs?
- Shh.

1610
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:19,920
- Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

1611
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,708
Look, like,
I don't think that he likes me.

1612
01:29:25,882 --> 01:29:28,406
So, I don't know,
I think one of you is gonna have to do it.

1613
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:29,756
Are you high?

1614
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:30,670
- What?
- Give her a break.

1615
01:29:30,844 --> 01:29:32,933
No. Me?

1616
01:29:33,107 --> 01:29:35,588
No, no. No. No. I don't do
that kind of stuff anymore.

1617
01:29:35,762 --> 01:29:37,328
That's just... it's not me.

1618
01:29:38,765 --> 01:29:40,331
- Hey, hey, ladies.
- Hey.

1619
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:42,290
Christmas come early.

1620
01:29:42,464 --> 01:29:44,335
Hey, these are my friends
that I told you about.

1621
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:46,294
- Hi, friends.
- This is Ramona.

1622
01:29:46,468 --> 01:29:48,165
- Ramona. Hi.
- Ramona. Hi.

1623
01:29:48,339 --> 01:29:50,037
- This is...
- And I'm Rhonda.

1624
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:51,995
- Rhonda. You are both very attractive.
- Rhonda. Yeah.

1625
01:29:52,169 --> 01:29:53,606
Thank you.

1626
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:57,044
Okay. Why don't you
take a seat right here.

1627
01:29:57,784 --> 01:29:59,742
We're gonna fix you a drink.

1628
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:02,310
- So, you stay there, okay?
- You get one too. Shots? I don't know.

1629
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:03,485
We'll see about that.

1630
01:30:12,929 --> 01:30:15,845
Just a second. Hmm.

1631
01:30:16,019 --> 01:30:17,717
Hope you're thirsty.

1632
01:30:23,374 --> 01:30:25,289
- Do it.
- No, just go ahead.

1633
01:30:26,377 --> 01:30:27,378
Go on.

1634
01:30:28,379 --> 01:30:30,120
You found him. Go ahead.

1635
01:30:36,126 --> 01:30:37,475
Hi.

1636
01:30:38,346 --> 01:30:39,347
Here you go.

1637
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:41,828
Yum, yum, yummers. Slàinte.

1638
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:44,831
So, who's excited?

1639
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,572
I'm telling you,
it's the same fucking car.

1640
01:30:47,747 --> 01:30:49,662
You're being paranoid.

1641
01:30:49,836 --> 01:30:51,968
No, I saw the same fucking Buick
parked outside the Gansevoort.

1642
01:30:52,142 --> 01:30:54,275
It's not a Buick.

1643
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:57,017
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's been following us for 20 minutes.

1644
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:59,846
- Dawn was setting us up back there.
- Dawn?

1645
01:31:00,977 --> 01:31:02,892
Now I know you're paranoid.

1646
01:31:03,066 --> 01:31:05,460
You really think that she wouldn't
sell you out to save herself?

1647
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:08,332
So, there was a sting?

1648
01:31:10,334 --> 01:31:13,163
We cannot comment on that
at this time.

1649
01:31:13,337 --> 01:31:15,775
But what we can tell you

1650
01:31:15,949 --> 01:31:18,516
is the amount of people that were willing
to talk to us was so small it was absurd.

1651
01:31:19,213 --> 01:31:21,128
Why?

1652
01:31:21,302 --> 01:31:23,826
I guess men don't wanna admit
what happened to them, you know?

1653
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,872
Being victimized by a woman.

1654
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:28,657
So, we did some investigating,

1655
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:30,050
and we found
the Connecticut architect

1656
01:31:30,224 --> 01:31:33,270
who Moves said
failed to pay a $135,000 bill

1657
01:31:33,444 --> 01:31:35,795
he racked up during
four visits to the club.

1658
01:31:35,969 --> 01:31:38,580
"For a night of pleasure
he can't even remember."

1659
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:40,669
What a boob.

1660
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:42,584
"And went back
three more times"?

1661
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:45,848
I guess he must've liked it.

1662
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:49,243
You know,
when you look at it out of context,

1663
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,505
it seems like
he's making it up.

1664
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:52,333
You're a family girl?

1665
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,204
You look like my brother.

1666
01:31:54,378 --> 01:31:55,292
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1667
01:31:55,466 --> 01:31:56,903
- You like that?
- No.

1668
01:31:57,077 --> 01:31:59,079
Why I'm here. I mean,
it's not about the money.

1669
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:01,821
It's about the next guy
this happens to,

1670
01:32:01,995 --> 01:32:04,214
and, like, I gotta
do something to stop that.

1671
01:32:04,388 --> 01:32:07,652
But when you put it
together with Doug, it all added up.

1672
01:32:07,957 --> 01:32:10,003
Peter.
Peter, these are my sisters.

1673
01:32:11,744 --> 01:32:13,746
Oh, yes!

1674
01:32:15,138 --> 01:32:16,226
Scary, isn't it?

1675
01:32:18,054 --> 01:32:20,491
I mean, we got so spooked,
none of us went back to the club anymore.

- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

1732
01:35:08,877 --> 01:35:10,879
Which one
of you is the ringleader?

1733
01:35:15,057 --> 01:35:16,493
This is unbelievable.

1734
01:35:16,667 --> 01:35:17,799
You guys are really something,
you know that?

1735
01:35:17,973 --> 01:35:19,061
Does Tony know about this?

1736
01:35:19,235 --> 01:35:20,584
Take a seat, Miss Vega.

1737
01:35:21,411 --> 01:35:22,456
This is crazy.

1738
01:35:22,847 --> 01:35:24,197
We didn't do anything wrong.

1739
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:27,200
You know, Tony wouldn't let this happen.
I'm gonna text him.

1740
01:35:27,374 --> 01:35:28,766
Who gave her her phone back?

1741
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:31,117
Think about your daughter.

1742
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:34,685
You're facing
felony charges here.

1743
01:35:35,686 --> 01:35:37,775
You really wanna go down
for someone else?

1744
01:35:39,516 --> 01:35:42,171
Come on. You want Lily
to grow up without her mother?

1745
01:35:43,259 --> 01:35:45,174
You think
these girls are your friends?

1746
01:35:46,001 --> 01:35:47,785
You don't think
they're gonna rat you out?

1747
01:35:49,178 --> 01:35:50,397
Think about your daughter.

1748
01:35:51,572 --> 01:35:53,313
Mercedes is probably gonna use
Dragon's lawyer.

1749
01:35:53,487 --> 01:35:55,576
So, you, me and Annabelle
should probably lawyer up.

1750
01:35:56,664 --> 01:35:59,275
Do we know any lawyers from the club?
That guy, Jeremy? Or maybe Anton?

1751
01:35:59,449 --> 01:36:00,537
I took the deal.

1752
01:36:06,413 --> 01:36:07,544
You did?

1753
01:36:15,074 --> 01:36:16,945
Have I taught you
fucking nothing?

1754
01:36:22,037 --> 01:36:24,648
You fucking idiot!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1755
01:36:25,736 --> 01:36:26,824
Why would you do that?

1756
01:36:26,999 --> 01:36:28,261
For Lily.

1757
01:36:40,055 --> 01:36:43,972
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1758
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:53,025
Motherhood is
a mental illness.

1759
01:37:06,429 --> 01:37:07,691
I'm sorry.

1760
01:37:12,174 --> 01:37:14,046
We were fucking hurricanes,
weren't we?

1761
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,308
Yeah.

1762
01:37:34,544 --> 01:37:36,372
- Hello?
- Hi. Um...

1763
01:37:36,546 --> 01:37:38,244
Hi, Elizabeth. It's Destiny.

1764
01:37:39,071 --> 01:37:40,724
Hey, Destiny. How are you?

1765
01:37:40,898 --> 01:37:42,335
I'm good. I'm really good.

1766
01:37:42,509 --> 01:37:44,467
Lily's great. Um...

1767
01:37:44,641 --> 01:37:47,775
Oh, I put the house up for sale.
We're moving back to Queens.

1768
01:37:47,949 --> 01:37:50,038
You know, I've been making
a ton of new friends.

1769
01:37:50,212 --> 01:37:52,519
And, oh, I met this guy who...

1770
01:37:52,693 --> 01:37:55,522
He's gonna help me get
a job in pharmaceuticals.

1771
01:37:55,696 --> 01:37:57,350
So I'm really excited
about that.

1772
01:38:00,831 --> 01:38:02,529
- Are you still there?
- I'm here.

1773
01:38:03,182 --> 01:38:05,097
So, I was just reading
the article again,

1774
01:38:05,271 --> 01:38:09,797
and maybe the reason
why we did what we did

1775
01:38:09,971 --> 01:38:13,192
is because hurt people
hurt people, you know?

1776
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:16,282
Yeah. No, I understand.

1777
01:38:20,547 --> 01:38:22,418
So, have you talked
to Ramona lately?

1778
01:38:23,506 --> 01:38:25,465
No, just that one time.

1779
01:38:27,162 --> 01:38:28,598
- Have you?
- No.

1780
01:38:29,686 --> 01:38:31,035
Um...

1781
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,735
Can I just ask you...

1782
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,783
Like, what else
did she say about me?

1783
01:38:40,393 --> 01:38:42,525
So, I used to live
in the Bronx back then.

1784
01:38:42,699 --> 01:38:46,355
But I was seeing this guy who had a
walk-up right next to where I stripped.

1785
01:38:46,529 --> 01:38:49,053
So, I was staying at his
place, like, every night.

1786
01:38:49,228 --> 01:38:52,492
But one morning, I go back to my
place, and the door's wide open.

1787
01:38:52,666 --> 01:38:55,190
And I was freaked out, you know?
I was like, "Oh, my God. All my stuff."

1788
01:38:55,364 --> 01:38:59,063
All my valuable stuff is in this
place that I'm not even sleeping in."

1789
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:01,544
So, now I just carry everything
with me everywhere I go.

1790
01:39:02,023 --> 01:39:03,024
Let me show you.

1791
01:39:04,547 --> 01:39:05,548
Let's see.

1792
01:39:06,419 --> 01:39:07,463
This.

1793
01:39:09,248 --> 01:39:11,598
This is a patch from my grandpa's uniform.
He was in the navy.

1794
01:39:12,773 --> 01:39:14,078
Oh!

1795
01:39:14,253 --> 01:39:17,386
This is my...
my grandma's wedding ring.

1796
01:39:17,865 --> 01:39:20,172
Isn't that pretty?
And this one was my mother's.

1797
01:39:20,346 --> 01:39:22,870
It's the three birthstones
of me and my sisters.

1798
01:39:23,044 --> 01:39:25,655
The ruby's me.
I was a July baby.

1799
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,529
I have two sisters. One lives in
Arizona, the other one lives in Texas.

1800
01:39:29,703 --> 01:39:33,620
We try to get together once a year,
but with the kids, it's impossible.

1801
01:39:33,794 --> 01:39:34,882
Do you have kids?

1802
01:39:35,187 --> 01:39:36,405
Not yet.

1803
01:39:36,579 --> 01:39:37,580
Well, don't worry.
You're young.

1804
01:39:37,754 --> 01:39:39,539
And you have amazing skin.

1805
01:39:42,106 --> 01:39:43,238
Is that you?

1806
01:39:44,631 --> 01:39:47,155
That's me.
I was 15.

1807
01:39:49,418 --> 01:39:51,203
A senior
had asked me to the prom.

1808
01:39:51,855 --> 01:39:53,205
I look terrified.

1809
01:39:53,379 --> 01:39:54,554
I like the dress, though.

1810
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:58,601
And this here,
this is Dorothy.

1811
01:39:59,123 --> 01:40:00,777
Wasn't she the cutest?

1812
01:40:02,649 --> 01:40:03,954
Who could leave that baby?

1813
01:40:06,783 --> 01:40:08,350
You know, we used to say,

1814
01:40:08,655 --> 01:40:11,614
"If only we had known
each other back then."

1815
01:40:11,788 --> 01:40:12,789
You know?

1816
01:40:15,444 --> 01:40:19,274
Maybe we could've...
looked out for one another.

1817
01:40:20,797 --> 01:40:22,930
Maybe our lives
would've been different.

1818
01:40:24,323 --> 01:40:25,367
You know?

1819
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,371
Or maybe it would've
just been the same.

1820
01:40:30,329 --> 01:40:31,373
Who knows?

1821
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,724
But I like to keep her
with me.

1822
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:52,568
What else you wanna know?

1823
01:41:22,381 --> 01:41:24,296
You should
give her a call, Destiny.

1824
01:41:26,602 --> 01:41:28,430
Yeah.

1825
01:42:06,686 --> 01:42:08,165
Look, there's nothing
I can really say

1826
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:10,646
to make sense
of what went down.

1827
01:42:11,647 --> 01:42:12,953
But everybody's hustling.

1828
01:42:14,476 --> 01:42:15,651
This city...

1829
01:42:16,304 --> 01:42:19,220
Fuck, this whole country
is a strip club.

1830
01:42:21,657 --> 01:42:25,661
You got people tossing the money...
and people doing the dance.

1831
01:42:32,015 --> 01:42:34,540
One last time, everybody,
let's hear it for our girls!

1832
01:42:34,714 --> 01:42:36,106
- Hit it!
- Okay?

1833
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:40,589
Whoo!

1834
01:42:46,029 --> 01:42:47,117
Oh!

1835
01:42:48,205 --> 01:42:49,772
Whoo!

1836
01:42:55,082 --> 01:42:58,390
One, two, three, four!
Go. Go. Go.

1837
01:43:11,403 --> 01:43:12,578
That's it, folks.

1838
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:15,581
It was fun while it lasted.

1839
01:43:20,716 --> 01:43:22,718
See me on your way out,

1840
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:25,591
I'll be selling excuses for why
there's glitter on your pants.

1841
01:43:34,077 --> 01:43:36,471
We got a lot of ladies
in the house tonight.

1842
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:39,518
Must be a bachelorette party
going on.

1843
01:43:44,348 --> 01:43:46,438
There is no flash photography
here at Moves.

1844
01:43:46,612 --> 01:43:49,310
In fact
no flashing of any kind.

1845
01:43:57,492 --> 01:43:58,928
It's time to go home
gentleman.

1846
01:43:59,102 --> 01:44:01,453
The girls are not coming
back out.

1847
01:44:08,329 --> 01:44:11,680
On behalf of Moves, make sure
you tip your waitresses,

1848
01:44:11,854 --> 01:44:13,595
and get home safe.

1849
01:44:17,294 --> 01:44:19,035
Good night everybody.

1850
01:44:19,645 --> 01:44:21,124
I'm sure I will see you again.

1851
01:44:21,385 --> 01:44:22,604
Real soon.
