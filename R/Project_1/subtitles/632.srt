1
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,568
-Come here, Bobby.
-Come on. Give me the ball. No fair!

2
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,453
You might need that.

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,163
Where'd you find this?

4
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,624
It was in one of those cartons
that came over after.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,548
-Needs oil.
-Who doesn't?

6
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,467
You ready?

7
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,929
-I'm not going.
-Mom!

8
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,974
I already got two children,
I don't need a third.

9
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,310
Why is it so important that I go?

10
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,897
Well, for one thing, it'd be nice
if you just left the room.

11
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,733
Besides, these are your old friends.

12
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,570
They probably won't even remember me.

13
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,823
The "Queen of Diamonds,"
Dottie Hinson?

14
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,367
I just don't think this is a good idea.

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:01,246
Oh, come on, Mom. I mean,
you're gonna get to see Aunt Kit.

16
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,082
-You hardly ever see each other.
-We still won't.

17
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,211
She'll be travelling around
with that husband of hers.

18
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,588
-Frank. He has a name.
-Frank.

19
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,007
And he's always been very nice to you.

20
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,510
He makes me nervous.

21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,013
-There's a lot of reasons why I can't go.
-Mom.

22
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,432
Honey,

23
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,353
I'm not comfortable about this.
I'm not really part of it.

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,315
It was never that important to me.
It was just something I did.

25
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,903
When are you gonna realise how
special it was, how much it all meant?

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,988
I...

27
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,617
Yeah. I know how you feel. I really do.

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,245
But you're going.

29
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,334
The car.

30
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,631
-A car, a train, a bus. I'm tired already.
-Sleep on the plane.

31
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,801
-Grandma's out. Is there a fire?
-Wisenheimer.

32
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,221
Julie next door is watching you.
I don't want any bad reports.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,598
-Okay. Bye, Grandma.
-Bye.

34
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,852
Jeffrey, come here.

35
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,649
No matter what your brother does,
he's littler than you are.

36
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,818
Give him a chance to shoot. Promise?

37
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,445
-Yeah.
-Okay.

38
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,781
Bobby, come here.

39
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,951
Kill him.

40
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,704
Come on, you'll miss your plane.

41
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,130
Yeah!

42
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,607
Well, I still think I shouldn't go.

43
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,849
Get a hit, Beans!

44
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,321
I'm coming, Mae! I'm coming!

45
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,500
This week in the world of sports.

46
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,920
With the boys overseas
and off to war,

47
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,215
baseball pitches in
for the war effort.

48
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,885
Trading bats for bullets,
Yankee Joe DiMaggio

49
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,262
promises to give
those Nazis a jolt.

50
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,473
Ace fireballer Bob Feller

51
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,560
has traded Cleveland grey
for Navy blue.

52
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,229
Baseball's biggest stars say:

53
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,357
"Look out, Mr. Hitler.
The Yanks are coming."

54
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,611
Not to mention the Indians,
Red Sox and Tigers.

55
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,114
And they won't come back
till it's over, over there.

56
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:10,704
Meanwhile, Chicago club owner
Walter Harvey, the candy-bar king,

57
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:15,250
met with other team owners at
the Harvey Mansion as rumours persist

58
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,588
that baseball may be shut down
for the duration of the war.

59
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,383
Harvey's promotional whiz kid,
Ira Lowenstein,

60
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,055
has been given the job of figuring out
how to keep baseball going.

61
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,933
Good luck, Mr. Lowenstein.

62
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,235
Strike 2!

63
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,078
Hey!

64
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,829
-Hey, fatso!
-Come on!

65
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,083
Get the hell out of the way!
What are you, crazy?

66
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,545
Strike 3!

67
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,676
Kit! Kit!

68
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:09,221
-Sis, don't swing at that high pitch.
-I can hit it.

69
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,765
-You can't.
-I can.

70
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,518
This bat's too heavy.
You'll never get it around.

71
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,270
I will!

72
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,691
Kit, Kit. Listen. There's a big hole
on the right side. Don't look.

73
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,485
-Unless she pitches inside, pull it.
-I know.

74
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,778
Batter up!

75
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,031
No high ones.

76
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,783
I like the high ones!

77
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,286
-Mule!
-Nag!

78
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,249
Come on, one more.

79
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,002
Easy out, easy out.

80
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,422
Come on, Kit. Keep your eye on the ball.

81
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,218
Right in here, right here.

82
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,970
Strike 1!

83
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,982
Strike 2!

84
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,943
Too high. No.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,993
All right, Kit. Look it over!

86
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,162
Look it over there!

87
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,831
Strike 3!

88
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,673
All right, two out, everybody.
That's two away!

89
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,343
-Better luck next time!
-Come on, Dottie!

90
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,720
-Knock it out of here!
-Okay, Dottie!

91
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,972
Two outs. Batter up!

92
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,518
Dottie!

93
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,606
-You can do it.
-Play ball.

94
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,942
Right in here, Becky.

95
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,611
Bring them in, bring them in!

96
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,489
Bring them in there, Dottie!

97
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,785
Ball!

98
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,627
-Keep your eye on it, Dottie!
-Come on, Becky.

99
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,505
Come on, Dottie! One hit and we win!

100
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,514
Dottie!

101
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,184
That's it, Dottie! You did it!

102
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,811
Great.

103
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,313
That's the ball game!

104
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,441
Dottie, Dottie, Dottie.

105
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,657
That was a swell hit. Good job!

106
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,578
Hey, Kit! What do you swing
at those high ones for?

107
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,539
Good thing your sister bailed you out.

108
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,251
How about that two bucks
you owe me for this game?

109
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,421
Kit! Wait up, I'll give you a ride!

110
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,676
-Would you stop kicking the rocks?
-I'm sorry.

111
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,097
-That game just made me so mad.
-Kit, we won. Get mad if we lose.

112
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,808
That last pitch was right down the middle.

113
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:02,811
If I'd have swung at that,
I'd be the big hero.

114
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,356
-You got me so crazy--
-All I said was lay off the high ones.

115
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,610
"Good thing
your sister bailed you out, Kit."

116
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,822
"Kit, why don't you get your sister
to teach you how to hit?"

117
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,533
"Why can't you be beautiful
like your sister?"

118
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,619
What idiot said that?

119
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,120
No one.

120
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,373
-But that's what they were thinking.
-No, it's not!

121
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,167
No?

122
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,878
You ever hear
Dad introduce us to people?

123
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,839
"This is our daughter Dottie.

124
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,885
This is our other daughter,
Dottie's sister."

125
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,180
Should've just had you
and bought a dog.

126
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,309
-Mitch Swaley likes you.
-He's one step up from dating pigs.

127
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,770
But an important step.

128
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,900
-Why are you walking so fast?
-Why are you?

129
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,111
-Because you are.
-Can't even let me walk faster than you?

130
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,571
Sure.

131
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:06,041
Girls, you got chores to do.

132
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,006
Don't run! You'll scare the chickens!

133
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,552
I don't have time for these games.

134
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,930
-Why are you running?
-You can run faster.

135
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,640
Your legs are longer.

136
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,059
-I win!
-Barely.

137
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,953
Hey.

138
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,790
Hey!

139
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,835
Hey, yourself.

140
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,006
Doesn't that hurt them?

141
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,799
It doesn't seem to.

142
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,178
That would bruise the hell out of me.

143
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,637
Who are you?

144
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,015
I'm Ernie Capadino, baseball scout.

145
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:06,894
I saw you playing today.
Not bad, not bad.

146
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,396
Ever hear of Walter Harvey?
Harvey Bars?

147
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,064
You know, the candy?

148
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,234
Yeah, we feed them to the cows
when they're constipated.

149
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,279
That's the guy. He's starting
a girls' baseball league

150
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,407
so we can make a buck
while the boys are overseas.

151
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,909
Wanna play?

152
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,914
Nice retort. Try-outs are in Chicago.
It's a real league, professional.

153
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,708
Professional baseball?

154
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,253
They'll pay you $75 a week.

155
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,797
We only make 30 at the dairy.

156
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,092
Well, then, this would be more,
wouldn't it? You interested?

157
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,638
Come on. Seventy-five dollars a week?

158
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,599
Pull her leg.
Mine are long enough already.

159
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,101
Look, your country needs you.

160
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,563
And you can not only play ball,
but you're kind of a dolly.

161
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,650
Oh, now I get it. Listen, mister.

162
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,569
I'm a married woman.
My husband's overseas.

163
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,323
Oh, relax!
I'm talking lookie, no touchie.

164
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,116
We want girls easy on the eye.

165
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,245
I'll go. I'm ready right now.
I gotta sign something?

166
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,040
I don't want you! I want her!
The one who hit the ball!

167
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,334
You can climb back under the cow.

168
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,545
She's good. She's very good.

169
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,756
She pitches. She didn't today,
because she did yesterday.

170
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,592
Thanks for that special glimpse
into her life.

171
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,885
I want you.

172
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:27,182
You I saw, you I like. What do you say?
The train leaves for Chicago tomorrow.

173
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,185
-What do you say? Are you in?
-No, thanks.

174
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,020
Dottie.

175
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,605
"No, thanks"?

176
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,899
Hey, no skin off my Ashtabula.

177
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,861
If you wanna pluck cows,
that's your business.

178
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,029
You know something?
You're not nice.

179
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:45,200
That one hurt. So long, milkmaids.

180
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,541
No, wait!

181
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,878
Just watch me pitch.
Dottie, get your mitt! I'll throw a few.

182
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,089
-I'll show you some pitches--
-No. No, no, no.

183
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,716
Now, look,

184
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:04,469
I know the goods when I see the goods,
and she's the goods.

185
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,805
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,731
Will you shut up?!

187
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,151
-You're a pitcher, huh?
-Yeah.

188
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,116
I'll tell you what.
If she comes, you can come too.

189
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,328
If you stink,
it'll only cost us a train ticket.

190
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,580
Get these wild animals away from me!

191
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,082
Haven't you ever heard of a leash?

192
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,046
Come on, Dottie.

193
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,633
You got the whole rest of your life
to hang around here.

194
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,427
Never go anywhere. Never do anything.

195
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:49,765
I'm married. I'm happy.
It's what I want. Let's not confuse things.

196
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,727
Okay.

197
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,272
But can't you just have this first?

198
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:01,985
Just so you can say you once
did something? Something special?

199
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:05,906
Goodness sake, Kit!

200
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,993
Keep your voice down.
Your father's listening to the radio.

201
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,996
Please, Dottie?

202
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,375
I gotta get out of here.

203
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,169
I'm nothing here.

204
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,631
Now let's return to our music today.

205
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,099
In the Pacific Northwest, my territory,

206
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:36,895
we have increased sales 106 percent
in the last 12-month period.

207
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,897
And this with a war on!

208
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,405
You know, if I had your job,
I'd kill myself.

209
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,576
Sit here. I'll see if I can dig up a pistol.

210
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,455
Every trip I take, I gotta sit
next to one of these guys.

211
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,332
I'm just too friendly.

212
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,709
Hey, isn't that--?

213
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,878
-I'm coming!
-Let me in!

214
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,546
Stop!

215
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:06,008
Well, I'll say one thing for them.
They can run.

216
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,678
Mr. Capadino! I got her! Look!

217
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:13,348
-Sir, your knee.
-Like it?

218
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,893
Stop the train!

219
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,857
Come on! Come on!

220
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,696
Give me that bag!

221
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,157
Come on.

222
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,993
Come on, here.

223
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,288
There you go. Now you, miss.

224
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,253
Did you promise the cows you'd write?

225
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,931
When do we get to Chicago?

226
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,935
We gotta make a stop.
Fort Collins, Colorado.

227
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,604
Gotta look at another girl.

228
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,106
Hope you're not jealous.

229
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,782
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay, honey. That was good form.

230
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,037
Thattagirl!

231
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,123
Good, honey. Good, good.

232
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,752
Nice, nice. That's a rope, honey.

233
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,756
Good girl. Good, good.

234
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,133
Right, too high.

235
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,719
She's got an eye like DiMaggio.

236
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,768
Good. Good, good.

237
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,271
Okay, Marla. Now lefty.

238
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,828
She's really good.

239
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:03,333
-She's your daughter?
-Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,961
Her mom's dead.
It's just the two of us.

241
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,174
Coach said if she was a boy,
she'd go to the state tournament.

242
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,469
I said, "If she was a boy, I'd talk
to the Yankees instead of living here."

243
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,184
That's enough.
You can bring her over.

244
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,686
Okay, Marla. Come here.

245
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,480
Boys! Hit the showers!

246
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,693
-You did good.
-I threw everything I had.

247
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,366
Take off your hat, honey.

248
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,088
We'll let you know.

249
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,634
Daddy, I'm sorry.

250
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,928
Come on, let's go.
We'll miss the train.

251
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,055
Let's move, move, move!

252
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,017
What's the matter?

253
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,394
I can't use her.

254
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,648
She's great. Why not?
What's the problem?

255
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,484
You know General Omar Bradley?

256
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,445
-Yeah.
-There's too strong a resemblance.

257
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,115
You ain't taking her
because she ain't pretty?

258
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,660
Well, look who just caught up!

259
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,828
All right. Come on, let's go.

260
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:25,582
Pick those suitcases up! Come on!

261
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,668
I'm not kidding. Let's go. Move!

262
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,796
-One foot in front of the other.
-Hey, mister?

263
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,137
I know my girl ain't so pretty
as these girls.

264
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,223
But that's my fault.

265
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,017
I raised her like I would a boy.

266
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,686
I didn't know any better.

267
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,773
She loves to play.

268
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,987
Don't make my little girl suffer
because I messed up raising her.

269
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,489
Please?

270
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,871
-Come on, get on the train.
-I wish you had a decent mitt.

271
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,415
I think maybe I'd better not go.

272
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,625
No, you can relace it.

273
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:09,835
It'll be okay.

274
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,963
No, I mean,
who's gonna take care of you?

275
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,299
Cook? Help you take care
of the equipment?

276
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,217
Don't you worry about me.

277
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:19,803
You're gonna play baseball.

278
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,432
I'm not gonna know anybody.

279
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,267
Marla.

280
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,188
Nothing's ever gonna happen here.

281
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,109
You gotta go where things happen.

282
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,988
I love you, Daddy.

283
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,658
-All aboard!
-Daddy.

284
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,247
-Let's go, let's go.
-All aboard.

285
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,208
Come on, honey.

286
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,093
Are you coming?

287
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:06,099
See, how it works is, the train moves,
not the station.

288
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,393
Bye, Daddy.

289
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,564
This is making me sick.

290
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,448
Write to me, honey.

291
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,284
I love you.

292
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,920
Goodbye.

293
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:55,190
Hey, cowgirls, see the grass?

294
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,817
Don't eat it.

295
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,534
Come on.

296
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,916
Okay, girls, this is it. Harvey Field.

297
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,543
Try-outs. Get out there.

298
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,296
Show them what you got.
Don't embarrass me.

299
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,299
It's been a thin slice of heaven.
Goodbye.

300
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,551
Wait. You're going?

301
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,012
Dry your eyes.

302
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,723
Yeah, I'm going home.
Grab a shower and a shave.

303
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,768
Give the wife a pickle-tickle,
and I'm on my way. I'll see you.

304
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,396
-But--
-But what?

305
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,315
Field! Try-outs! Play!

306
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,192
That's it! Get lost!

307
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,860
Come on, guys.

308
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,114
I hate when they get attached
to me like that.

309
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,160
You've got an arm.

310
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,459
-Hey, Mae.
-What?

311
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,253
-Come look at this.
-Wait a second, Doris.

312
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,006
I can't wait much longer, so get up.

313
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,800
Yeah, so?

314
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,720
Yeah, so I ain't done yet. Watch this.

315
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,265
-That's it?
-You can't do it, Mae.

316
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,352
I could do it. How long
you been working on that, Doris?

317
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,103
-That? Took me a year.
-Yeah.

318
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,149
Not counting the two months I was
in the hospital. Bat hit me in the head.

319
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,442
-Really?
-Yup.

320
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,570
Your head and not your behind?
That looks really swollen.

321
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:28,909
-What kind of thing is that to say?
-I'm joking. I'm nervous, all right?

322
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,410
I don't--

323
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:32,579
-What are you looking at?
-Yeah, what?

324
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,581
Nothing.

325
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,959
-Yeah, nothing.
-That's right, nothing.

326
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,795
All these girls gonna be in the league?

327
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,130
-You wish.
-You do wish.

328
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:45,509
-Four teams. Sixteen girls to a team.
-That's right.

329
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,803
Sixty-four girls.

330
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,596
Yeah. What are you, a genius?

331
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,767
They got over 100 girls here,
so some of youse will have to go home.

332
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,727
-Yeah, sorry about that.
-Come on, Doris.

333
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,230
-What do you mean, "some of us"?
-Do it.

334
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:06,780
-Okay, some of them are going home.
-Hey. How did you do that?

335
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,866
Excuse me. Hey. Hey.

336
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,868
-You caught that. Hello?
-Doris.

337
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,329
Did you see? Jeez. Let's go practise.

338
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,791
-She caught it with her bare hand.
-Okay, okay. Be quiet.

339
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,796
And now, from Chicago,
The Mutual presents

340
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:26,592
another social commentary
by Miss Maida Gilespie.

341
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,886
Careers and higher education

342
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,181
are leading
to the masculinization of women

343
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,142
with enormously dangerous
consequences

344
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,520
to the home, the children
and our country.

345
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,106
When our boys come home from war,

346
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:44,234
what kind of girls
will they be coming home to?

347
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:48,405
And now, the most disgusting example

348
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:52,492
of this sexual confusion,
Mr. Walter Harvey, of Harvey Bars,

349
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,663
is presenting us
with women's baseball.

350
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,751
Right here in Chicago, young girls
plucked from their families

351
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,086
are gathered at Harvey Field

352
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:06,632
to see which one of them
can be the most masculine.

353
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,637
Mr. Harvey, like your candy bars,
you are completely nuts.

354
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,738
Come on, come on, come on.

355
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,323
Heads up, heads up.

356
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,458
Very good. Try another.

357
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,569
Nice throw!

358
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,323
Come on!

359
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:35,679
Your name will be
on one of those five lists.

360
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,222
Okay, find your name.

361
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:44,188
If we could just form
two or three parallel lines...

362
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,148
Yeah!

363
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,902
Yes!

364
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,989
I'm a Peach!

365
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,118
-What?
-A Rockford Peach!

366
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,495
I made it! I can stay!

367
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,292
Are you a newspaper guy? This is
my friend Mae. She made the team.

368
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,461
Hi. Pleased to meet you, Mae.

369
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,381
Okay, come on, we got a lot to do.
Let's settle down.

370
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,467
Now, you're the first--

371
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:20,557
Honey, are you supposed to be here,
or are you on the cut list?

372
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,269
Look, I'm sorry.

373
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,106
If you're on the cut list,
you have to leave the field.

374
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,942
Well, are you cut?

375
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:35,322
Look on the list. It's either Rockford,
Racine, Kenosha or South Bend.

376
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:38,659
-Hi.
-Hi.

377
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,411
Can you read, honey?

378
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,080
No.

379
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,457
All right, what's your name?

380
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,377
-Shirley Baker.
-Shirley Baker.

381
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,921
Shirley Baker. Let's just take a look.

382
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,639
This is you.

383
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,392
You're with us.
You're a Rockford Peach.

384
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,645
Go join your team.

385
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,272
Okay, ladies.

386
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,899
Let's settle down.
We got a lot to go over.

387
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,318
First, congratulations.

388
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,904
You are the first members

389
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:19,324
of the All-American
Girls' Baseball League.

390
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,330
I'm Charlie Collins.

391
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:29,126
I'll be managing the Racine team
when the season starts.

392
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:32,087
The other teams
will have managers soon.

393
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,715
At the end of practice today,

394
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,968
y'all have to get fitted
for your uniforms.

395
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:42,055
And this is what they're gonna look like.
Pretty darn nifty, if you ask me.

396
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,432
How about that one?

397
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,475
You can't slide in that.

398
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,687
-Hey, that's a dress.
-It's half a dress.

399
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,439
That's not a baseball uniform.

400
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:53,734
What do you think we are,
ballplayers or ballerinas?

401
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,736
It's awfully short.

402
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,531
Short? I'm gonna have to squat
in that thing.

403
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,993
I can't wear that.
My husband will kill me.

404
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,830
-Ladies! Ladies!
-Excuse me, sir.

405
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,040
Excuse me.

406
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:11,627
If you can't play ball in this,
you can't play ball with us.

407
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,714
There are 38 girls
getting train tickets home

408
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,383
who'll play in a bathing suit
if I ask them.

409
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,178
There's no pockets for my cigarettes.

410
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,014
There is no smoking.

411
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,433
There is also no drinking
and no men.

412
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,562
Your social engagements will be cleared
through your team chaperones.

413
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:34,566
Plus each of you will have regular classes
at charm and beauty school.

414
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,737
-For what?
-Every girl in this league will be a lady.

415
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,493
And gracefully and grandly.

416
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,704
Gracefully and grandly.

417
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:51,291
Gracefully and grandly.

418
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:54,503
Gracefully and grandly.

419
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,464
Gracefully and grandly.

420
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,258
All right, girls, now go back!

421
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,552
And sip.

422
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,763
Down. Don't slurp.

423
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,348
Sip.

424
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,977
Down. Don't slurp.

425
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,603
Sip.

426
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:15,482
Down. Don't slurp.

427
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,150
Sip.

428
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,069
-Stop that!
-Why?

429
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:20,279
It's good.

430
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,781
Posture.

431
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,617
Heads up.

432
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:27,619
Backs straight.

433
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,788
And sit.

434
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,128
Right over left.
Legs always together.

435
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:37,713
A lady reveals nothing.

436
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,132
Stop it.

437
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,259
And...

438
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:46,513
The hair. Soften and shorten.

439
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,976
The eyebrows. Thin and separate.
There should be two.

440
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,355
Very nice.

441
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,400
Very nice!

442
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,694
Lovely!

443
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,615
What do you suggest?

444
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,242
A lot of night games.

445
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:15,042
Come on, I wanna show you the grounds.
You know, I always--

446
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,252
Jimmy, come on.

447
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,546
I'm showing you around. Beautiful, huh?

448
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,715
Place used to be a golf course.

449
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:24,676
I never cared for the game myself,
but I love grass.

450
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:28,555
It costs a fortune to keep like this,
with the mowing and trimming.

451
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:32,976
But I grew up in an apartment.
I had one lousy plant in a cheese box.

452
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:35,812
Now look. I got a park.

453
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,900
These are my in-laws. Hello!

454
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,695
They can't hear nothing.
Enough socializing.

455
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:47,157
Jimmy, I'm thinking of giving you
another managing job.

456
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,036
Oh, well, Mr. Harvey,

457
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,039
I guarantee I'll do a better job
than last time.

458
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:57,543
You kind of let me down
on that San Antonio job.

459
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:02,256
Yeah, yeah. I had no right to sell off
the team's equipment like that.

460
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:04,633
-That won't happen again.
-Let me be blunt.

461
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,885
Are you still a fall-down drunk?

462
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:10,722
Well, that is blunt.

463
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,893
No, sir. I've quit drinking.

464
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,937
You've seen the error of your ways?

465
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,439
No, I just can't afford it.

466
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,025
That's funny to you?

467
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,695
Your drinking is funny?

468
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,572
You're a young man, Jimmy.

469
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,408
You still could be playing

470
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:33,287
if you just would've laid off the booze.

471
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,749
Well, it's not exactly like that.

472
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,376
I hurt my knee.

473
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,421
You fell out of a hotel.
That's how you hurt it!

474
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:43,839
There was a fire.

475
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:46,300
Which you started,
which I had to pay for.

476
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,051
I was gonna send you

477
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,847
a thank-you card, but I wasn't
allowed anything sharp to write with.

478
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:56,059
Look, Jimmy, I want you to manage
one of the new girls' baseball teams.

479
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:00,355
Don't look so stunned. Face it.

480
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:04,985
You're still a name. You step out
of the dugout before every game.

481
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:08,322
You wave your little hat.
You give the people a thrill.

482
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,533
Why not get an organ grinder?
I can hop around and dance.

483
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,785
If your knees are up to it,
go ahead.

484
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,955
Mr. Harvey...

485
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:21,001
I hit 487 home runs
for your baseball club.

486
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,712
Three in the World Series,
two in Game 4 alone.

487
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,506
I know that.

488
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:27,966
That's why I'm giving you this job.

489
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,968
Take it or leave it.

490
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:31,678
I gotta feed the fish.

491
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,353
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the first game

492
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,189
of the All-American
Girls' Baseball League.

493
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:46,485
The South Bend Blue Sox
against your own Rockford Peaches.

494
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:50,030
-Where is he? It's game time.
-I can't believe he's our manager.

495
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:53,450
I was listening to the radio when he hit
that home run to win the pennant.

496
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,035
Oh, yes.

497
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,829
I'll get him to sign
my husband's baseball card.

498
00:33:57,996 --> 00:34:00,499
Do you mind?
Could I take a look at that?

499
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,417
All right, but just be careful.

500
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,630
If anything happens to that, George'll
come back from the Pacific and kill me.

501
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,270
-Mr. Dugan--
-Mr. Dugan, I'm simply...

502
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,480
Hi.

503
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:41,665
-Get down from there.
-I can't believe he's doing that.

504
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,719
-Do something, Mae.
-Oh, yeah.

505
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,681
-Time him at least.
-Give me your watch.

506
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,350
Could be a record.

507
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,108
That counts.

508
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,943
How long?

509
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,197
I ain't gonna ask you again.

510
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,699
Shut up, Doris.

511
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:21,997
Keep timing.

512
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:31,089
-Hey. Hey. Hey, Mae, how long?
-Doris.

513
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,634
Boy, that was some good peeing.

514
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,346
Hey, coach.

515
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:41,475
Mr. Dugan? Could you sign
my husband's baseball card for me?

516
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:45,854
Hey, great to meet you!

517
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,441
What'll we do?
He didn't give us a line-up.

518
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:53,570
-We can't play without a line-up.
-I'll pitch. I can pitch.

519
00:35:57,324 --> 00:36:01,036
-I thought I was playing centre field.
-No, I would like centre field.

520
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,831
Hey, hey. Hey, you guys. Come on.

521
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,209
How hard can it be to make a line-up?

522
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:10,003
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you do it, Oregon?

523
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,339
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

524
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,884
All right. Mae, centre field, lead off.

525
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:17,177
She's good.

526
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,972
And now, the manager of the Peaches,

527
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:23,433
former six-time
National League home run champ,

528
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,185
Jimmy Dugan!

529
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:28,272
Yeah, Dugan! Dugan!

530
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:29,773
Jimmy!

531
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:33,944
Hey, Jimmy, look up here!
We love you!

532
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:38,323
Bullshit. You can all kiss my ass.
That's right.

533
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,285
Kiss my big hairy ass.

534
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:42,744
You're the best, Jimmy!

535
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,205
And the Rockford Peaches!

536
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:48,625
Doris Murphy takes the field!

537
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,379
Hey, lift up your skirt!

538
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,551
-This should be something.
-Ain't too many people here.

539
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,469
-You nervous, Doris?
-Yeah.

540
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,096
I ain't.

541
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:07,311
-Are they laughing at us?
-Yeah, they're laughing at us.

542
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:11,064
What makes you think
you can play baseball?

543
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,734
-They hate us.
-Just keep smiling.

544
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,861
Hey, your cookies are burning!

545
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:19,531
Hey, glamour puss!
Can you throw the ball?

546
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,825
All right, ladies, let's play ball!

547
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:24,578
-Let's play ball.
-Dirt in the skirt!

548
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:27,915
-Let's go.
-And now, the line-up for Rockford:

549
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,584
Leading off and playing centre field,

550
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:33,420
-number 5, Mae Mordabito.
-Thank you, thank you.

551
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:38,217
Batting second and playing third base,
number 22, Doris Murphy.

552
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:43,680
Batting third, the catcher,
number 8, Dottie Hinson.

553
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:48,477
Batting fourth and playing second base,
number 32, Marla Hooch.

554
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,562
Girls can't play ball!

555
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:54,900
-Batting fifth and playing left field...
-Look at me! I'm a ballplayer!

556
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:03,909
-Get a load of that.
-Hey, girls, look at these legs!

557
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:07,037
Better look out,
I might break a nail!

558
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,249
--number 1, Ellen Sue Gotlander.

559
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:17,005
-...number 17, Evelyn Gardner.
-Good throw. You nailed him! All right?

560
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,342
-It slipped.
-Batting ninth, pitcher,

561
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,971
-number 23, Kit Keller!
-Fresh roasted peanuts!

562
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,180
Get your peanuts!

563
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:29,643
Count's 2 balls and no strikes
to Rockford's big catcher, Dottie Hinson.

564
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,145
And it's in the dirt, 3 and 0.

565
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:36,024
Let's see if Jimmy Dugan gives her
the green light on 3 and 0

566
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,776
or gives her the take sign.

567
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:41,738
Game's tied 2-2,
the bottom of the 9th,

568
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,075
with two runners in scoring position
and only 1 out.

569
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,244
From the belt, here's the delivery.

570
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:54,334
Oh, baby! She hit the cream cheese
out of that one!

571
00:38:57,462 --> 00:39:00,507
Jimmy Dugan, master strategist,
had her swinging away!

572
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,926
Boy, he sure knows his baseball.

573
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,304
Come on, Dottie!

574
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,763
Come on, make me proud!

575
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,850
A 3-run clout for Dottie Hinson

576
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,852
and Rockford wins it, 5 to 2.

577
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,604
-Hey!
-All right, Dottie!

578
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,772
That's the way to play!

579
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,567
Dottie, ladies and gentlemen! Dottie!

580
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,528
I couldn't believe
you hit it right out there!

581
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,785
-Jimmy, can we have your autograph?
-Can we have your autograph?

582
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,330
-Jimmy, please?
-Not today, boys.

583
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,290
Come back next game.

584
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,841
Nice piece of coaching, Jimmy.

585
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:47,012
Especially in the 5th inning
when you scratched your balls for an hour.

586
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,432
Yeah, well, anything worth doing
is worth doing right.

587
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,142
Yes, indeed.

588
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:55,687
Until you did that, I couldn't tell
if you were drunk or dead.

589
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,238
It was made very clear to me
what I'm supposed to do here.

590
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,742
I smile...

591
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,913
wave my little hat, and I did that.
So when do I get paid?

592
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:17,209
You have some good ballplayers.
If you'll only give them--

593
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:18,919
Ballplayers!

594
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,839
I haven't got ballplayers!
I've got girls!

595
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:25,968
Girls are what you sleep with after
the game, not what you coach during it.

596
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,185
If we paid you more, could you be
just a little more disgusting?

597
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,563
Well, I could certainly use the money.

598
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,111
On the home front,

599
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,738
they find them everywhere,

600
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,867
North, East, South and West,
and even Canada:

601
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,246
Players for the new
All-American Girls' Baseball League.

602
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,710
After a month of league play,

603
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:03,672
the shine still isn't off
these Diamond Gals.

604
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:06,633
Alice "Skeeter" Gaspers says:

605
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,512
"Legging out a triple is no reason
to let your nose get shiny."

606
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,849
Betty Grable has nothing
on these gals.

607
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:18,854
Helen Haley has not only been on
several championship amateur teams,

608
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:22,024
she's also
an accomplished coffeemaker.

609
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,109
Coffee.

610
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:26,069
With her husband in the Pacific,

611
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:28,947
Betty Horn enjoys
cooking spaghetti and knitting.

612
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,909
Her teammates call her
"Betty Spaghetti."

613
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:36,788
Ellen Sue Gotlander is
a former Miss Georgia.

614
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,542
Then there's pretty Dottie Hinson,

615
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:43,086
who plays like Gehrig
and looks like Garbo.

616
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:46,757
Fellas, keep your mitts to yourself.
She's married.

617
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:52,513
And there's her kid sister Kit,
who's as single as they come.

618
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,392
Enough concentrated "oomph" for
a whole carload of Hollywood starlets.

619
00:41:58,101 --> 00:42:00,938
And how about Marla Hooch?

620
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:03,565
What a hitter!

621
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,234
What a league!

622
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,446
-But girls playing baseball?
-She's out!

623
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,864
She's out!

624
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,950
Yeah!

625
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:15,911
Game ball!

626
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,664
That's good work.

627
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,837
She can hit that ball.

628
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,505
-Enjoy that?
-Yeah!

629
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:30,759
-Good. Come back next game, will you?
-Good hitting. Good hitting. Take care.

630
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,511
-Take care.
-Mr. Dugan?

631
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,430
I'm Evelyn Gardner.

632
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:40,227
Yeah. I play right field.

633
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:43,730
For us.

634
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,777
I, see--

635
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,947
I just spoke to my husband last night.

636
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:55,284
He says I can't leave our son
with him at home anymore.

637
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,620
See, he says he's too busy
reading the want ads

638
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,164
and-- And

639
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:05,627
I should just take him with me
and shut up about it. So can I?

640
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,590
Take my son with me on road trips?

641
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,140
Ballplayers...

642
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:29,026
Well, he's the sweetest little boy.

643
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:31,695
Everyone's just gonna love him.

644
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,455
What's going on? Hey!

645
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:49,588
Get this brat off of me!

646
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:54,676
-Oh, thank God.
-Are you all right?

647
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:56,428
That's it! I quit!

648
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:58,847
-Stilwell, come to Mommy.
-That kid is trouble.

649
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,475
-You're too young to drive.
-I will. Watch.

650
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:03,727
Evelyn. Evelyn!

651
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:06,522
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to kill your son!

652
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,065
No, Mae! Mae!

653
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,067
Wait! The girls have a game!

654
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:12,903
You can't leave like this!
Please, Mr. Goosatelli!

655
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,697
Get over here, Stilwell!
I'm gonna kill you!

656
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:19,076
-Mae!
-You can't catch me!

657
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,454
Don't use my bat, use Marla's!
It's heavier!

658
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,791
-Evelyn, why is he so wild?
-I don't know.

659
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:29,878
Stilwell, angel,
have another chocolate bar.

660
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:31,839
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!

661
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:36,009
You can't. You can't leave us like this.
We're in the middle of nowhere!

662
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:38,679
-We can't be here! Please!
-No!

663
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,889
No.

664
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:43,851
Keep him away from me.

665
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,603
He's really a sweetie, Dottie.

666
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,438
I hope I have five just like him.

667
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:51,149
-Don't eat the wrapper, honey.
-Dottie.

668
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:59,283
-You gonna come with us?
-Where you going?

669
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:01,994
A roadhouse called the Suds Bucket.

670
00:45:02,536 --> 00:45:04,371
No, you know, I'm married. I'm...

671
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,542
Come on, Dottie, you ain't
on the farm anymore. Live a little bit.

672
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,503
Girls! Girls! Please!

673
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,132
Mr. Goosatelli shan't be returning.

674
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:20,179
How are you gonna get past
Miss Cuthbert?

675
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:23,098
-Mae's gonna poison her dinner.
-What?

676
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,812
Mr. Dugan.

677
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:32,524
Mr. Dugan.

678
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,695
-Mr. Dugan!
-What is it, baby?

679
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:57,090
What the hell is going on?!

680
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:00,385
-Why are we stopped?
-Lou quit.

681
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:02,679
Who's Lou?

682
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,599
The driver.

683
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,435
A car could've came by now.

684
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,103
-Come on, you girls!
-What?

685
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,524
-Get on the bus!
-What did he say? Was that English?

686
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,694
I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.

687
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,572
Hey, who's in my seat?

688
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,831
In the 43 years I've practised medicine,
I never saw a woman throw up that much.

689
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:33,043
Maybe that's how
she entertains herself, doc.

690
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,296
Oh, there, yes, yeah.
There we go. Good, good.

691
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,634
Hurry, come on.

692
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:42,636
Quiet.

693
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:45,514
-Mae, what did you give her?
-Oh, now, what a shame.

694
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:48,892
-Who cares? It's working.
-I wouldn't wear those shoes again.

695
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:09,037
I'm going, baby!

696
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,998
Come on, way to go, Mae!

697
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,007
-Doris!
-He's kind of cute, Mae.

698
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:23,552
I'm coming in, Mae!

699
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,806
-Come on, doll.
-God.

700
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,089
Catch me!

701
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,760
Did you see me, Kit? I pretzeled!

702
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:13,602
Doris. Look how Mae is...

703
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:16,813
-How did you learn how to do that?
-She taught me.

704
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,901
My father owns a dance hall, upstate.
Vinnie's Dance Girls Deluxe.

705
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:23,362
She was one of the dancers,
I was a bouncer.

706
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:27,199
All right, let's go.

707
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,332
You were great!

708
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:31,263
-Thanks for the ride, kid.
-What's your rush, doll body?

709
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,434
What do you say we slip in the back seat
and you make a man out of me?

710
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,771
What do you say
I smack you around for a while?

711
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:41,190
Can't we do both?

712
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:53,952
-I'm not hot. It's fine.
-That's the one I like right there.

713
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:55,871
It's really cold.

714
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,332
-That's better.
-Where's Kit? Hi.

715
00:49:58,498 --> 00:50:01,293
I think she's on the dance floor.
There she is.

716
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,588
I got my truck parked outside.

717
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:05,797
Kit. Hey.

718
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:08,634
Sorry, we gotta go. Come on.
Alice, come on.

719
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,719
Guys, we gotta go. We got trouble.

720
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:15,265
-I knew it. You killed Miss Cuthbert.
-We'll bury her. I know a guy--

721
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:20,062
It's Lowenstein. He's on his way.
He catches us, we're out of the league.

722
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:23,690
Let's make like a bread truck
and haul buns, ladies.

723
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,236
-See you, Mae.
-Let's duck out the back door.

724
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:30,322
Is this all of you? Marla didn't come?

725
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:31,907
She came.

726
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,244
Yeah, well, where is she?

727
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,497
There.

728
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:56,431
-What did you do to her?
-Nothing, we just gave her a dress.

729
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,433
And a lot of liquor.

730
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,311
That's right. You gave her liquor.
I'm saying...

731
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:04,231
All right, you guys go ahead.
I'll get Marla.

732
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,526
Hurry up.

733
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:09,236
-Dottie.
-Hurry up, ladies!

734
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:10,904
Thanks.

735
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,768
Marla?

736
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:44,605
Marla?

737
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,192
Marla, honey? We gotta go. Come on.

738
00:51:48,358 --> 00:51:51,278
I'm singing to Nelson! Ain't I, baby?

739
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:53,113
You sure are.

740
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:57,117
-Marla, come on.
-No!

741
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:59,578
I could take her home.

742
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:03,040
-It'd be an honour.
-Ain't he something?

743
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:19,431
That's the second time he dropped
that Bible since she's been in there.

744
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:33,695
Come on, girls.

745
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:36,782
-Mae, what'd you say?
-Everything.

746
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:39,451
"Here's a good job for you, Jimmy.

747
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:42,829
Managing girl ballplayers.

748
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:47,793
You just go out there and you wave
your little hat around.

749
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,795
Don't drink!"

750
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:54,007
Why would I want to drink?
I'm a goddamn Peach!

751
00:52:57,052 --> 00:53:00,806
Double play.
Now I'm hitting like a girl.

752
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:04,226
"But be nice to them.
They're good ballplayers."

753
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:07,062
There, catch that, blondie!

754
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,150
Now batting for the Rockford Peaches,

755
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,361
number 5, centre fielder,

756
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:19,408
-Mae Mordabito!
-Come on, no hitter, no hitter.

757
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:21,577
Here's the pitch.

758
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,996
There's a shot into right centre!

759
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,081
It's up the alley!

760
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:29,418
-Go to third!
-Turning around first! Digging up dirt!

761
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:31,503
She's heading past second.

762
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,173
-Go to third!
-Heading into third!

763
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,758
Dirt in the skirt, Mae!
Dirt in the skirt!

764
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:39,261
-Safe!
-In there with a triple!

765
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,470
Time.

766
00:53:40,637 --> 00:53:43,765
Boy, did she smack that one
right on the kisser.

767
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:46,476
No wonder
they call her "All-the-Way" Mae.

768
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,063
Triple.

769
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:51,940
Next batter,

770
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:57,112
number 32, second baseman,
Marla Hooch. Hooch.

771
00:53:57,821 --> 00:54:01,325
Evelyn, look at this!
I've got Stilwell's snack on my cleat!

772
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:02,784
Marla!

773
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:05,078
Easy out, easy out!

774
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:09,666
-What's the signal?
-Keep your eye on it, Marla.

775
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,629
What are you, stupid?

776
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:16,173
Somebody's gotta run the team.

777
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,425
Someone who actually watches
the games.

778
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,720
You're gonna squeeze bunt
with our best hitter?

779
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:24,223
What's the sign to swing away?

780
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,725
Hey, blond girl! What's the sign?

781
00:54:26,892 --> 00:54:29,061
It's the letters. A squeeze'll work.

782
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:32,481
Stop thinking with your tits,
you want a big inning. Batter!

783
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:33,690
Time!

784
00:54:58,799 --> 00:54:59,842
Come on!

785
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:03,220
Hey, who is the goddamn manager here?
I am!

786
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,514
Then act like it, you big lush!

787
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,810
-You tell him, Dottie!
-About time someone told him.

788
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:14,147
-I'm ready now.
-Play ball!

789
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,316
Oh, goody.

790
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:18,652
Show her something.
Put it by her.

791
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,284
Way to go, whatever your name is!

792
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:30,539
Good bluff!

793
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,170
But I still say you're not ballplayers.

794
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,056
Cemetery boneyard! Cross your fingers
or you'll never get another hit.

795
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:50,350
Sound it out.

796
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,353
Kimono.

797
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,732
"Kimono off and...

798
00:55:57,608 --> 00:55:58,942
gra-bed..."

799
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,444
Grabbed.

800
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:02,237
"...her...

801
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,159
...milky-- Milky...

802
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,037
...white-- Milky white..."

803
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,206
What are you giving her to read?

804
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:14,625
What's the difference?
She's reading.

805
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,503
That's the important thing.
Now go away! Go! Shoo!

806
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:20,380
-Go ahead, Shirley. You're doing good.
-Thanks.

807
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:22,424
Okay.

808
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:24,009
"Milky...

809
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:25,802
white...

810
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,642
breasts."

811
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:36,563
It gets really good after that. Look.

812
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:40,067
-A delivery boy walks in.
-What you doing?

813
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:41,735
Oh, I'm writing a song.

814
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:44,655
-Really? What's it about?
-Yeah.

815
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,323
About us.

816
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,200
Could you teach it to me?

817
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,203
-Doris, is this your boyfriend?
-Yup.

818
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:57,125
-Is it out of focus?
-No, that's how he looks.

819
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:01,755
Looks aren't the most important thing.

820
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:06,468
Right. The important thing is he's stupid,
out of work and treats me bad.

821
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:08,470
Then why...?

822
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,515
Why? What do you think? Because

823
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:14,142
none of the other boys ever...

824
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,521
Always made me feel like I was wrong,
you know?

825
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:21,900
Like I was some sort of a weird girl
or a strange girl,

826
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:25,279
or not even a girl,
just because I could play.

827
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,282
I believed them too.
But not anymore, you know?

828
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:31,577
I mean, look. There's a lot of us.

829
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:33,704
I think we're all all right.

830
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,290
We are.

831
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:40,878
Hey, give me that.

832
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:47,759
So long, Charlie!

833
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:56,226
So with two runs in the 6th,
South Bend gets even.

834
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,939
-I've gotta go! I've gotta go!
-We'll get it back.

835
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:03,150
You shake it off. Shake it off.

836
00:58:06,195 --> 00:58:09,823
Say, Evelyn, can I ask you a question?
You got a moment?

837
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:13,410
Which team do you play for?

838
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:17,915
-Well, I'm a Peach.
-Well, I was just wondering

839
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,126
because I couldn't figure out
why you'd throw home

840
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:23,253
when we've got a 2-run lead!

841
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,007
You let the tying run get on second,
and we lost the lead!

842
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,800
You start using your head!

843
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:32,804
That's that lump that's three feet
above your ass!

844
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:41,939
Are you crying?

845
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:44,900
-No.
-Are you crying?

846
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,693
Are you crying?!

847
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,570
There's no crying!

848
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:51,073
There's no crying in baseball!

849
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,535
-Why don't you leave her alone?
-Oh, you zip it, Doris!

850
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:58,830
Rogers Hornsby, my manager,
called me a "talking pile of pig shit"!

851
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:01,500
That was when my parents came
from Michigan

852
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:04,753
-to see me play the game! Did I cry?
-No, no.

853
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,090
-No! No! Do you know why?
-No.

854
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:12,094
Because there's no crying in baseball.
There's no crying in baseball!

855
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:13,762
No crying!

856
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:17,850
-What's the matter, Jimmy?
-She's crying, sir.

857
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,561
I didn't mean to do that.

858
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,355
Perhaps you chastised her
too vehemently.

859
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:28,068
Good rule of thumb: Treat each
of these girls as you would your mother.

860
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:32,447
Anyone ever tell you
you look like a penis with a hat on?

861
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:34,199
You're out of here!

862
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:36,201
-I heard that!
-You misunderstood.

863
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,036
-Ten seconds!
-You misunderstood!

864
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:41,498
You can't throw me out
knowing you've got a strike zone...

865
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,375
Off this field!

866
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:46,295
-Get in that dugout! Get off this field!
-You're out.

867
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,339
I can't believe
no one ever called you that before!

868
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:51,717
That's where you belong.
I'm in charge now.

869
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,386
All right, who's up here? Who's up?

870
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:58,348
The crowd's light today,
what with the tractor show in town.

871
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:03,395
If you're nearby, and you must be,
since this isn't a powerful radio station,

872
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,773
come on down to the ballpark
and bring the kiddies.

873
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,818
People better start showing up.

874
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,446
We don't have fans,
we don't have a league.

875
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:16,867
-Ladies, you all look wonderful.
-Mr. Lowenstein.

876
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:18,493
-Hello.
-Hi.

877
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,790
There's a reporter and a photographer
in the stands from LIFE magazine.

878
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,126
-We're famous!
-LIFE magazine?

879
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,253
Don't waste your time, Doris.

880
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,506
-We get that in Saskatchewan.
-Dottie,

881
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:33,300
I'm trying to get them
to do a story about you.

882
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:35,302
Me? Why me?

883
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:38,680
You're the "Queen of Diamonds."
That's what I'm calling you.

884
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,642
Did you tell them about me?

885
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:45,103
I told them how at first,
the scout didn't even want you,

886
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:48,357
but how Dottie wouldn't come
without her kid sister.

887
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:52,486
They loved it. They really loved it.

888
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,863
A real human-interest story.

889
01:00:56,532 --> 01:01:00,661
So will you just try to give them
something spectacular out there?

890
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:02,037
Anything.

891
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:03,455
Why, what's the matter?

892
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:08,043
Well, Mae, we're not doing so well.

893
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:12,047
Harvey and the other owners
think they've made a mistake.

894
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:14,299
They're talking about
closing you down.

895
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,678
-What?
-What are you talking about?

896
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,847
They can't close us down here.

897
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,724
-What kind of a thing is that?
-What does that mean?

898
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:26,436
They're businessmen.
No profit, no product.

899
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:28,605
And what am I supposed to do, huh?

900
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,983
Go back to taxi dancing?

901
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:34,653
Ten cents so some slob
can sweat gin all over me?

902
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,406
I'm never doing that again.

903
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:42,661
So you tell old rich Mr. Chocolate Man
that he ain't closing me down!

904
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:44,872
They can't keep us from playing!

905
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,999
We'll show them how we play.

906
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:52,379
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I am trying my best.

907
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:55,841
So will you just give them
everything you've got?

908
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:57,593
We always do.

909
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:05,517
A slick play by Alice Gaspers
and there's 2 gone

910
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:08,353
here in the 3rd.
That'll bring up Dee Lynch.

911
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:15,110
Lynch is the most consistent
Belles hitter this year.

912
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:17,613
-Okay, burn it in.
-Settles in.

913
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,742
Pops it up! Foul.

914
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:24,161
Hinson should have
no trouble with this.

915
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:25,329
She's under it.

916
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:27,873
-Out!
-Uncle Elmore's socks!

917
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,876
What did she do?

918
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:36,006
-I can't do that.
-Who can?

919
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:39,384
-What is her name?
-Dottie Hinson. D-O-T-T-I-E.

920
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:42,346
-Good play.
-What the hell was that?

921
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:44,389
I just thought
it might help the league.

922
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:47,518
Shit! I'm in a goddamn circus!

923
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:49,561
A triple. A double would be nice--

924
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:51,355
All right!

925
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,691
God knows we have a game.

926
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:58,654
It's not like any of this helps,
believe me.

927
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,121
Safe!

928
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,083
That was really nice!

929
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,252
All right, all right. Let's go, girls.

930
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:16,088
Dozens of people are waiting
for the game to start.

931
01:03:34,314 --> 01:03:35,482
Yeah!

932
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:44,700
Batter!

933
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:49,580
What is her name?
Hey, you, tall girl!

934
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,206
-Beverly.
-Beverly!

935
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:53,584
Look sharp, tall--
What is her name again?

936
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,627
-Beverly.
-Beverly. Good. Good.

937
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:01,758
Yeah! Five bucks! Five bucks!

938
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:11,685
What if, at a key moment in the game,
my uniform bursts open

939
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,854
and my bosoms come flying out?

940
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:16,899
That might draw a crowd, right?

941
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:20,110
Think there's men in this country
who ain't seen your bosoms?

942
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:21,653
Thank you.

943
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:25,073
-Marla, what you got?
-What about me?

944
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,492
I got a letter from Nelson!

945
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:32,706
Fly ball as Dottie Hinson brings

946
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:35,167
the crowd to its feet
with a home run!

947
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:40,214
-Twenty-two!
-Twenty-two!

948
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:42,841
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

949
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:47,179
-We love you, 22!
-Hey.

950
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:48,722
-Come on!
-Open your mouth!

951
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:52,351
-Evelyn.
-Kid! Kid! The kid ate the line-up!

952
01:04:55,354 --> 01:04:56,939
Right here.

953
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:16,500
I'm so happy! Thank you.

954
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:18,544
Thanks so much. Thanks.

955
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:21,171
Thanks. Thank you.

956
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:23,715
-I love you.
-I'm so happy.

957
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:26,218
-I'll be back next season.
-Marla.

958
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,303
-See you next season!
-Bye, Marla.

959
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,805
Bye. Bye!

960
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,353
Slide! Slide!

961
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:38,021
Safe!

962
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:39,439
Thank you!

963
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:41,275
Let it up. Let it up.

964
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,110
And...

965
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,570
That was a good one.

966
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:48,574
-There's a fly ball to left!
-Get under it!

967
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:51,034
Betty Spaghetti makes the catch!

968
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:55,414
Brock tags up. Spaghetti makes
the throw! It's gonna be close!

969
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:57,249
And...

970
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:00,294
-Aunt Edna's bridgework! She is out!
-Out!

971
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:03,130
Dottie Hinson held onto the ball!

972
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:04,923
Oh, doctor!

973
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,887
A lot of ballplayers use it.

974
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,811
Out!

975
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,943
High foul pop.

976
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:27,905
It's coming back! Coming back!

977
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,574
She caught it! Unbelievable!

978
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:34,703
Full house on its feet
cheering Dottie Hinson!

979
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,085
-That sounded good.
-Yeah.

980
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:44,713
-You haven't got a curve ball left.
-I don't?!

981
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,175
-You haven't had a curve ball since--
-Have you been watching?

982
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:14,493
-Safe!
-Safe!

983
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,037
-Safe!
-She is safe!

984
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,813
Okay.

985
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:47,776
He's good-looking.

986
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:52,781
-What's he do when not in the Army?
-Dairy assistant manager.

987
01:07:52,948 --> 01:07:55,659
He's gonna be manager someday.
He's real smart.

988
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:58,203
So he's good-looking and smart.

989
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,038
There's so few of us.

990
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,042
Where did you say he was again? Italy?

991
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:08,213
Yeah, I think. I haven't got a letter
from him in three weeks.

992
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,424
I used to get one every week.

993
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,136
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

994
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:19,808
If he's in combat, it's not like there's
a mailbox on every corner.

995
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:23,812
Besides, if something happened,
you would've got a telegram.

996
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:28,108
-Oh, God, don't--
-But he's fine. No, he's fine.

997
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,279
How come you're not in the Army?

998
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:36,325
I have no cartilage

999
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:40,621
in my knee. Not that you
need cartilage to shoot Nazis.

1000
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,624
You need this, right? Trigger finger.
I could do that.

1001
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,334
Right.

1002
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,506
How did I get so useless so fast?

1003
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:55,219
Here's one that's been getting
a lot of play lately.

1004
01:08:56,595 --> 01:09:00,599
-Boys really like this on your fingers?
-It works for me.

1005
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:05,770
Your sister's not gonna be mad, is she?

1006
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:07,606
I don't care.

1007
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,359
Listen, when...

1008
01:09:11,193 --> 01:09:13,237
-Bob.
-...Bob comes back,

1009
01:09:14,112 --> 01:09:17,448
-are you gonna keep playing?
-Oh, no.

1010
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:20,285
-You could just quit like that?
-Sure.

1011
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,328
You play like you love it.

1012
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,542
No. No.

1013
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:29,252
-Does he know how good you are?
-Bob?

1014
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:31,171
No, Hitler. Yes, Bob.

1015
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:33,715
How good am I?

1016
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,970
You stink.

1017
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:41,265
You're lousy.

1018
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:45,269
You're only the best player
in the league. You don't know that?

1019
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:46,979
Well...

1020
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:49,689
You ever been married?

1021
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:53,861
Well, let me think. Yeah, twice.

1022
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:56,655
Any children?

1023
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,199
One of them was, yeah, yeah.

1024
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,620
-Is she out?
-Yeah.

1025
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:06,790
Well, I think it's time for a drink.

1026
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,419
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1027
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:14,298
-These really don't mix.
-Here.

1028
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:30,522
-Good, huh?
-Oh, yeah. It's great.

1029
01:10:37,196 --> 01:10:38,405
Fair ball!

1030
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,289
Time!

1031
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:50,167
Jimmy Dugan pops his head
out of the dugout.

1032
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:53,045
He's on his way to talk to his hurler.

1033
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:56,882
Kit Keller looks mighty tired.

1034
01:10:57,674 --> 01:10:59,343
Game's getting pretty exciting.

1035
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:02,554
I'll finish it right here.

1036
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,598
I'll strike this turkey out.

1037
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:07,476
Betty's ready to come in.

1038
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:10,103
Come on. I've never been
taken out before.

1039
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,980
Ask Dottie.

1040
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:16,276
I really wanna finish this game,
Jimmy. Please?

1041
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:21,240
What do you think?

1042
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:25,619
Well, you know, she's battling.

1043
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:31,542
-What do you think?
-She's done. She's throwing grapefruits.

1044
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:34,002
Blue!

1045
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:40,467
It looks like Keller's coming out
of the game, and she is not happy about it!

1046
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:42,928
Nice job, Kit!

1047
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:47,474
Betty Horn sprints in
from the left-field bullpen.

1048
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,438
Look at this crowd. This is great.
They're jumping, hopping, cheering

1049
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:55,274
and they paid to get in.

1050
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,235
You did a fabulous job.
I won't forget this.

1051
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:02,531
Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey.
I appreciate it, coming from you.

1052
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:07,327
But to be perfectly honest, I think
the girls deserve most of the credit.

1053
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,620
Oh, they're great.

1054
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:12,332
Fortunately, we won't need them
anymore. Do you want a peanut?

1055
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:14,209
No. What do you mean?

1056
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:17,004
What do you mean, what do I mean?

1057
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:20,340
We're winning the war.
Our situation changed.

1058
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:24,845
Roosevelt himself said,
"Men's baseball won't be shut down."

1059
01:12:25,012 --> 01:12:27,556
So we won't need the girls next year.

1060
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:34,104
Bases loaded. Bottom of the 9th.
Rockford up 6 to 2. Two men out.

1061
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:37,232
-No balls, 2 strikes.
-Okay, Betty, right here.

1062
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:39,776
Strike 3!

1063
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:45,073
And that is the ball game!
Rockford is in the playoffs!

1064
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:50,662
I love these girls.
I don't need them, but I love them.

1065
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:52,873
Look at that. Come on. Let's go.

1066
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:59,546
Oh, look at me. I'm full of peanuts!
I've got peanuts all over myself.

1067
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:03,467
This is what it's gonna be like
in the factories too, I suppose.

1068
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,677
"Men are back, Rosie.
Turn in your rivets."

1069
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:09,890
We told them it was their patriotic duty
to get out and go to work.

1070
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:13,143
When the men come back,
they're sent back to the kitchen.

1071
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:18,815
Should we send the boys returning
from war back to the kitchen? Come on.

1072
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:21,735
Excuse me.

1073
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:25,197
Do you know how dedicated they are?
What they go through?

1074
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:28,033
They play with sprained ankles,
broken fingers.

1075
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,703
They ride a bus all night to play
a double-header the next morning.

1076
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:34,331
I'll make it up to them.

1077
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,041
What? With Harvey Bars?

1078
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,877
I'm getting tired of listening to you, Ira.

1079
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:43,924
I'd like your permission
to take over the league.

1080
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,300
What?

1081
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:48,470
Do you understand?
All of the owners are getting out.

1082
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:50,722
There's no point to it anymore.

1083
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:53,767
Just let them finish the season,
and that's it!

1084
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:58,438
I sold your product when there
was no product. This is a product!

1085
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:03,068
There is no room for girls' baseball
in this country

1086
01:14:03,235 --> 01:14:05,487
once the war is over.

1087
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,072
They're through.

1088
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:10,325
I think you're wrong.

1089
01:14:11,076 --> 01:14:13,996
And I'm gonna prove it to you,
Mr. Harvey!

1090
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:18,917
Hi, my name's Mae. That's more
than a name, that's an attitude.

1091
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:22,504
Here's my friend Doris.
Best player on the team.

1092
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:23,797
Smile for the camera.

1093
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:26,008
-Thank you, Mae.
-You're the best.

1094
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,386
-The game put us in the playoffs.
-I could have finished.

1095
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:31,513
Stilwell could've hit off you.

1096
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:36,101
What's the matter?
Too big to finish your own games now?

1097
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,106
Hey!

1098
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:45,068
Don't start with me, Kit.
Don't you start with me. Don't start!

1099
01:14:45,235 --> 01:14:46,778
Kit, come on, cut it out!

1100
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:53,160
What the hell are you doing?!

1101
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:56,079
-Hey, you guys.
-Get off of me!

1102
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,789
-Jimmy!
-Stop it!

1103
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:02,085
Get off of her.

1104
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:04,671
-Get your sister off of her!
-Stay out of it!

1105
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:06,256
-You stay out of it!
-Doris!

1106
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,765
You just wait, Doris!

1107
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:17,309
Let me down!

1108
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,939
Let me down!

1109
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:29,404
You stay down there and you cool off!

1110
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:37,746
-Why'd she do it?
-She was vulnerable. You provoked her.

1111
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,749
-Shut up, Helen!
-You're making her more upset.

1112
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,042
Really!

1113
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:44,711
-I don't need it from Helen too.
-Take a shower.

1114
01:15:44,878 --> 01:15:49,424
-Leave me alone, I'm not taking a shower.
-She reminds me of my husband.

1115
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:56,139
Save some hot water for me,
you guys.

1116
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:57,891
You okay?

1117
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:01,520
My rear end hurts
where Jimmy dropped me.

1118
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:05,691
-You acted like a baby out there.
-You treat me like a baby.

1119
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:09,027
I treated you like a pitcher
who'd lost her stuff.

1120
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:13,240
When Betty's in trouble, you nurse her.
Every pitch, you're backing her up!

1121
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:15,450
I seem to remember last week,

1122
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:17,911
somebody throwing
a rosin bag in my face.

1123
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:21,790
Told me to get my fat ass behind
the plate. Was that you or the umpire?

1124
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,959
You could've backed me up today

1125
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:26,420
instead of holding me back.

1126
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:27,963
I hold you back?

1127
01:16:32,426 --> 01:16:34,052
It's like at home.

1128
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:37,055
It's like if you're here,
then I'm not here.

1129
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:38,682
What does that mean?

1130
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:43,312
I don't know what I mean.
I know I'm wrong.

1131
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:47,774
I know you're right and I'm wrong.
I know that. I just-- You--

1132
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,987
I just get so mad!

1133
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:56,742
Why do you gotta be so good, huh?

1134
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,120
Hey, Kit.

1135
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:02,789
Kit.

1136
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:13,675
Dottie, there you are.
You weren't on the bus.

1137
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:15,427
Could I speak to you a minute?

1138
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:20,224
I have to leave.

1139
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:22,893
Don't worry.
The bus wouldn't leave without you.

1140
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,604
No. I'm going home.
I'm leaving the team.

1141
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:27,856
What?

1142
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:30,108
-Why? What--
-I have to go home.

1143
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:33,403
Home? You can't go home now. No, it--

1144
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,656
This couldn't come at a worse time.

1145
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:40,202
You see, we're in a bit of a crisis,
and I have to try to pull something off.

1146
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:43,205
It's not a good time to lose
our most popular player.

1147
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:47,543
-What's the problem? Maybe I can help.
-I don't wanna talk about it.

1148
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,545
It's personal?

1149
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:56,176
It's one of the girls, isn't it?
It's Mae, right?

1150
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:01,098
No. Kit, that's it.
I've noticed there's some friction.

1151
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:05,018
That's fine. That's no problem.
Doesn't mean you have to quit.

1152
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,854
I can arrange a trade.

1153
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,731
Like Racine? Kenosha? South Bend?

1154
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:11,483
Trade me or whatever.

1155
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:14,653
But figure it out by tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'm going home.

1156
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:19,449
Tomorrow? Fine!
I'll work everything out by tomorrow.

1157
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:22,077
You really gave me a scare there
for a second.

1158
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:26,373
Hey, does anybody have
any extra hose?

1159
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:31,044
-Does anybody have any extra hose?
-Mae, your date's here.

1160
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:34,381
-How do I look?
-Where'd you get that dress?

1161
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:36,967
-Borrowed it.
-It don't fit. It's too tight.

1162
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,928
I don't plan on wearing it that long.

1163
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:42,931
I don't know why you get dressed at all.

1164
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:48,812
-Where's Dottie?
-In there.

1165
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:52,649
-Wanna go to the movies with me?
-You wanna go with me?

1166
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:55,194
-You bitch!
-What?

1167
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:57,654
I've been traded to Racine!

1168
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:02,743
You? I told them to trade me.

1169
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,163
Oh, yeah, they'd really trade you.
Miss Star, Miss Perfect.

1170
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,081
You knew what was gonna happen!

1171
01:19:08,248 --> 01:19:11,502
-I didn't!
-This'll be better than the movies.

1172
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:16,173
-I'll quit. Is that what you want?
-Then they'll blame me for you quitting!

1173
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,758
What do you want me to do?

1174
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:21,845
Stay away from me. Leave me alone!
That's what I want you to do!

1175
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,263
Kit, listen to me.

1176
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,766
It was all a mistake, okay?
A big mistake.

1177
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:28,185
-I was getting too good.
-You won't listen.

1178
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:32,147
I knew if I did too good,
you'd do something to push me down!

1179
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:43,784
Blow it out your rear end! I'm sick
of being blamed for everything

1180
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,328
bothering you.
I got you into this league!

1181
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:47,871
She got her in the league.

1182
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:51,291
-I didn't even wanna be here!
-Then why are you still here?

1183
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:57,923
Kit wants to know
why she's still playing.

1184
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:01,927
My train leaves at 8:00.
I got 10 minutes to pack.

1185
01:20:03,262 --> 01:20:05,472
If you have trouble,
you know who to blame.

1186
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:08,725
-I'll see you in the World Series.
-Yeah, you bet you will.

1187
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:11,061
Don't look at her. Don't look at her.

1188
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:16,817
Has anyone seen my new red hat?

1189
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,528
Oh, piss on your hat!

1190
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:22,364
-Well, that seemed uncalled for.
-Mommy!

1191
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,366
Oh, God!
Just keep it down, okay?

1192
01:20:24,533 --> 01:20:26,118
-Kit's off our team.
-She's not!

1193
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:27,703
Yes, she is. Are you deaf?

1194
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:30,205
-Kit?
-Oh, no.

1195
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:33,083
Kit, you need any help in there?

1196
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:37,713
Don't act like this.
You're still in the league.

1197
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,258
You're just on another team,
that's all.

1198
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:49,433
Batter up

1199
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,769
Hear that call

1200
01:20:52,936 --> 01:20:55,355
The time has come

1201
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:58,817
For one and all

1202
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:02,487
To play

1203
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,615
Ball

1204
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:07,701
For we're the members of

1205
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:11,038
The All-American League
We come from cities

1206
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:13,123
Near and far

1207
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:15,626
We got Canadians

1208
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,336
Irish ones and Swedes

1209
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:21,548
We're all for one, we're one for all
We're All-American

1210
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:25,511
Each girl stands
Her head so proudly high

1211
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:27,304
Her motto, do or die

1212
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:32,142
She's not the one to use
Or need an alibi

1213
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:36,396
Our chaperones are not too soft
They're not too tough

1214
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:40,609
Our managers are on the ball

1215
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:43,445
Now, Miss Cuthbert...

1216
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:45,989
You gorgeous stack
of pancakes, you!

1217
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:49,368
Man on the floor!

1218
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:51,870
Already dressed.

1219
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:55,791
Get Stilwell away.
I don't know what he's doing.

1220
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,543
Get him away from the tape!

1221
01:21:57,709 --> 01:22:00,963
-Stilwell, angel, come here now.
-All right.

1222
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:04,550
-Come over here.
-All right, everybody, let's listen up.

1223
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:09,429
I was in the toilet reading my contract,
and it turns out I get a bonus

1224
01:22:09,596 --> 01:22:11,473
when we get to the World Series.

1225
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,268
So let's play hard! Play smart!
Use your heads!

1226
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:17,604
That's that lump three feet
above our ass, right, Jimmy?

1227
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,401
Well, some more prominent
than others there.

1228
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:23,986
Come in.

1229
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:27,197
Excuse me.

1230
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:29,241
Excuse me!

1231
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:31,952
I got a telegram
from the War Department.

1232
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:33,704
Oh, my God! Ernie!

1233
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:35,455
Let's see.

1234
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:38,834
Boy, I hate these. These are the worst.

1235
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:42,588
The Army could at least
send someone personally

1236
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,590
to tell you your husband's dead.

1237
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,093
Darn! I had the name right here.

1238
01:22:49,928 --> 01:22:52,681
Well, I gotta go back
and get this straightened out.

1239
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:54,349
-Sorry.
-Hey.

1240
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:58,770
-Just give me the telegram.
-I can't. I don't have a name.

1241
01:22:58,937 --> 01:23:00,689
-Just give me the telegram.
-Hey.

1242
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:03,901
This is official.
This is from the War Department!

1243
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:07,070
Come on! That's official business!

1244
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:08,906
I'm coming--

1245
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,094
Miss Cuthbert. Miss Cuthbert.

1246
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:48,487
-I'm sorry, Betty.
-No, it's George!

1247
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:56,578
No, no, no!

1248
01:23:59,373 --> 01:24:00,457
It's okay.

1249
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,919
-Jimmy, you wanna take her?
-All right.

1250
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:09,299
-It's okay. It's okay.
-It's George!

1251
01:24:09,466 --> 01:24:11,468
It's okay.

1252
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:17,766
It's George. No.

1253
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:20,227
No.

1254
01:24:24,356 --> 01:24:26,191
All right, come on. Come on.

1255
01:24:26,358 --> 01:24:28,360
We still got a game to play.

1256
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:02,436
Come in.

1257
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:13,197
Hiya, cutie.

1258
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,450
Bob.

1259
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,703
How...?

1260
01:25:20,746 --> 01:25:22,581
How did you...?

1261
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:26,418
Bob! Oh, my God!

1262
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:27,669
Bob, what happened?

1263
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,215
-Oh, I'm fine.
-What is it?

1264
01:25:31,381 --> 01:25:33,383
It was a sniper.

1265
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:36,929
I was lucky though.
He got seven of us before we got him.

1266
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:42,518
Oh, sweetie! Oh, sweetie!

1267
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:46,188
It's all right. I made it.

1268
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:49,733
-I missed you so much.
-I've been discharged.

1269
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,277
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1270
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:57,324
-It's all over. I'm here, baby.
-Yeah. Okay.

1271
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:58,825
Well, listen.

1272
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:00,953
You have to sit down here.

1273
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:03,789
I'll clear all this stuff off.

1274
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,669
I almost forgot how beautiful you are.

1275
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:12,506
-Oh, no. I look terrible.
-You look beautiful.

1276
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:18,053
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1277
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:28,480
I love you.

1278
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:36,321
Can we just hold each other
for the rest of our lives?

1279
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:40,951
That's my plan.

1280
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:57,217
Why am I the only person on this bus?!
What are we waiting for?!

1281
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:01,471
Are you physically unable
to show up on time?

1282
01:27:01,638 --> 01:27:03,515
-Coming, Jimmy.
-Bye.

1283
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:07,311
If you think you can do
without the batting practice, think again.

1284
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:09,605
Not with the way you've been hitting.

1285
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:13,066
Oh, let's not go to the World Series
without Stilwell's toys!

1286
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:18,405
-Alice, what time is it where you live?
-Don't yell before a game. It's bad luck.

1287
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:20,991
-Mr. Dugan?
-Yeah?

1288
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:23,493
-Could you sign my baseball?
-Sure.

1289
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:27,372
There.

1290
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:30,292
"Avoid the clap. Jimmy Dugan."

1291
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:35,839
That's good advice!

1292
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:41,345
Dottie. Write to us. We'll miss you.

1293
01:27:41,512 --> 01:27:43,180
We will. Thanks.

1294
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:45,349
Good luck in the World Series.

1295
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:50,646
-Bye!
-Bye, girls. Bye, girls.

1296
01:27:50,812 --> 01:27:53,732
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Molly.

1297
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:57,027
So lovely. We'll be back.

1298
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:02,533
-Taking a little day trip?
-No.

1299
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:04,284
Bob and I are

1300
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:05,869
driving home

1301
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:07,454
to Oregon.

1302
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:16,713
I really thought you were a ballplayer.

1303
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:20,217
-Well, you were wrong.
-Was I?

1304
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:24,596
Yeah. It is only a game, Jimmy.

1305
01:28:24,763 --> 01:28:27,266
It's only a game,
and I don't need this.

1306
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,476
I have Bob. I don't need this. I don't.

1307
01:28:32,521 --> 01:28:36,900
I gave away five years at the end
of my career to drinking.

1308
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:39,403
Five years.

1309
01:28:39,736 --> 01:28:43,824
There isn't anything I wouldn't give
to get back any one day of it.

1310
01:28:46,076 --> 01:28:47,744
Well, we're different.

1311
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:55,794
That's chickenshit. You wanna go home
and make 100 babies, great.

1312
01:28:55,961 --> 01:28:57,880
I can't tell anyone how to live.

1313
01:28:58,046 --> 01:29:00,924
But sneaking out like this,
quitting...

1314
01:29:01,383 --> 01:29:05,596
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Baseball is what gets inside you.

1315
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:09,141
It's what lights you up.
You can't deny that.

1316
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:11,810
It just got too hard.

1317
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:16,481
It's supposed to be hard.

1318
01:29:16,982 --> 01:29:19,610
If it wasn't hard,
everyone would do it.

1319
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:22,821
The hard is what makes it great.

1320
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:35,375
Everything all right?

1321
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:38,879
Yeah, fine. Fine.

1322
01:29:39,505 --> 01:29:41,006
Bye, Jimmy.

1323
01:30:02,778 --> 01:30:05,239
First game of the first
women's baseball World Series.

1324
01:30:05,405 --> 01:30:08,700
This is history in the making.
History in the making!

1325
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:19,962
-This is for you.
-We brought you these also.

1326
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:22,339
-For me?
-Thank them!

1327
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:34,852
Yes!

1328
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:45,279
-Cut that out!
-I'm sorry.

1329
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:47,739
You're out!

1330
01:30:52,661 --> 01:30:53,745
Safe!

1331
01:31:05,257 --> 01:31:08,218
Two box seats on the third base line.
Anybody want them?

1332
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:10,637
I got two box seats. Who wants them?

1333
01:31:10,804 --> 01:31:12,181
-One of them.
-Ten bucks.

1334
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:15,893
That's my daughter, third baseman,
Doris Murphy. Best one they got.

1335
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:18,228
-Where you from?
-Staten Island.

1336
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:21,481
After the game, I'm gonna
take her out for a steak dinner.

1337
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:25,319
All right, all right, all right!

1338
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:28,280
Time for the song and dance.
What is that smell?

1339
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:30,908
Alice thinks it's bad luck
to change her socks.

1340
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:33,243
So we all have to suffer? Get away.

1341
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:38,123
Outfielders, play deep a couple steps.
Don't give up anything long. Alice?

1342
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:42,419
If the lead-off hitter gets on,
they're gonna bunt. Be ready. All right.

1343
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:46,006
Now, I'd like to...

1344
01:31:48,467 --> 01:31:50,552
I'd like to lead you all in a prayer.

1345
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:51,803
-Come on.
-A prayer?

1346
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:53,597
-A what?
-Come on.

1347
01:31:55,349 --> 01:31:58,268
-Yes, a little prayer. Come on!
-Is he serious?

1348
01:31:58,435 --> 01:32:02,564
-Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
-Okay, good, good.

1349
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:06,735
Lord...

1350
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:09,655
hallowed be thy name.

1351
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:13,825
May our feet be swift.

1352
01:32:14,368 --> 01:32:16,453
May our bats be mighty.

1353
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:19,248
May our balls

1354
01:32:19,706 --> 01:32:21,375
be plentiful.

1355
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:23,460
And, Lord,

1356
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:28,006
I'd just like to thank you
for that waitress in South Bend.

1357
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:31,343
You know who she is.
She kept calling your name.

1358
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:33,762
And, God...

1359
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:38,016
these are good girls,
and they work hard.

1360
01:32:38,684 --> 01:32:42,271
Help them see it all the way through.
Okay, that's it.

1361
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:44,106
-Let's go.
-Amen.

1362
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:47,568
Okay.

1363
01:32:47,734 --> 01:32:51,446
Go Peaches!

1364
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:56,660
Last game. Now or never, ladies.

1365
01:33:01,164 --> 01:33:04,626
Alice, you're killing me.
You're killing me, Alice!

1366
01:33:04,793 --> 01:33:07,504
You're goddamn killing me!

1367
01:33:49,922 --> 01:33:53,634
Well, this is it, folks.
One game for the whole ball of string.

1368
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,344
There is no tomorrow.

1369
01:33:55,511 --> 01:33:57,971
Someone will walk out
league champions

1370
01:33:58,138 --> 01:34:00,390
and someone else
will just walk out.

1371
01:34:00,557 --> 01:34:05,270
You're gonna lose!
You're gonna lose!

1372
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:06,605
Stilwell! Come here!

1373
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:09,274
-Evelyn!
-What?

1374
01:34:09,441 --> 01:34:11,985
You keep that kid away from me
for just one game!

1375
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:14,905
-Stilwell, come here.
-Ellen Sue, how's it looking?

1376
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:17,157
-Good.
-Feeling good? Looking good!

1377
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:18,534
-Nice and warm?
-Warm.

1378
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,538
Good. Alice, if Ellen Sue doesn't
have anything, don't keep it a secret.

1379
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:26,333
You tell me. You tell me right away.
You understand me?

1380
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,001
Do you hear me?!

1381
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:30,170
Yeah, you're screaming. I hear you.

1382
01:34:33,048 --> 01:34:34,341
Where'd you come from?

1383
01:34:35,509 --> 01:34:38,762
We got as far as Yellowstone Park
and turned back.

1384
01:34:41,139 --> 01:34:43,684
Have trouble with bears, did you?

1385
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:47,771
I was fine until that scout walked
into our barn. I'm no quitter.

1386
01:34:47,938 --> 01:34:51,066
Wait. Wait a minute! Hold it!
Who said you could play?

1387
01:34:54,486 --> 01:34:57,072
Alice has been catching for us
the last six games.

1388
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:00,868
She looks pretty good.

1389
01:35:02,411 --> 01:35:04,121
You don't want me to play?

1390
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:07,124
Well, you're already dressed.

1391
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:11,044
Hell, if you want to play,

1392
01:35:11,503 --> 01:35:12,796
I don't care.

1393
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:14,840
You can play.

1394
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:18,969
-Well, then, I'll play.
-Okay.

1395
01:35:19,928 --> 01:35:20,971
Good.

1396
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:23,140
-Fine.
-Fine. Go play.

1397
01:35:25,225 --> 01:35:26,602
Hey, Jimmy.

1398
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:31,231
You look like shit.
Don't you ever shave?

1399
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:37,905
-You're gonna lose! You're gonna lose!
-We're gonna win.

1400
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:41,700
-We're gonna win!
-You're gonna lose!

1401
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:43,493
You're gonna lose!

1402
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,704
You stink!

1403
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:49,041
You're gonna lose! You're--

1404
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:53,837
Got him!

1405
01:35:54,963 --> 01:35:56,632
Blue! Line-up change!

1406
01:35:56,798 --> 01:36:00,219
-It's okay. He's okay.
-Evelyn, he deserved it.

1407
01:36:00,385 --> 01:36:03,972
Stilwell, you gonna stay out here
or come in the dugout?

1408
01:36:04,306 --> 01:36:07,392
Okay. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1409
01:36:08,018 --> 01:36:10,187
-Strike!
-Strike!

1410
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:19,655
-You're out!
-All right!

1411
01:36:21,156 --> 01:36:22,991
Come on! Come on, Evelyn!

1412
01:36:23,158 --> 01:36:24,326
Three! Three!

1413
01:36:25,661 --> 01:36:26,703
Strike!

1414
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:30,332
You're out!

1415
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:34,086
-You're out!
-You're out, Brenda! You are out.

1416
01:36:35,963 --> 01:36:37,714
Go! Go! Go!

1417
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:42,427
Heads up! Heads up!

1418
01:36:45,013 --> 01:36:47,391
-Yes.
-Good, Mae! Good catch!

1419
01:36:47,558 --> 01:36:48,600
Thank goodness.

1420
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:52,062
-Go get them!
-All right, two down! Two down!

1421
01:36:56,984 --> 01:36:59,403
Base hit, right field.
Gardner's up with it.

1422
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:01,154
Wallace'll stop at third.

1423
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:03,740
Gardner's throw is way off line!

1424
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:06,994
Evelyn! What are you do--?

1425
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,663
Go, go, go! All the way, all the way!

1426
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:11,790
I'm sorry! Shoot!

1427
01:37:11,957 --> 01:37:16,837
Wallace scampers home,
and the Belles take the lead, 1 to nothing!

1428
01:37:17,004 --> 01:37:19,631
They're dancing in the aisles
here in Racine!

1429
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:25,971
Yeah!

1430
01:37:27,931 --> 01:37:31,143
Go Peaches, go Peaches!

1431
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:33,770
Evelyn!

1432
01:37:40,402 --> 01:37:42,404
I know. I know.

1433
01:37:43,155 --> 01:37:44,823
I know.

1434
01:37:48,827 --> 01:37:50,913
You're still missing the cut-off man.

1435
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:53,999
That's something
I would like you to work on

1436
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:56,210
before next season.

1437
01:37:58,295 --> 01:38:01,840
Right. Okay.

1438
01:38:02,007 --> 01:38:03,967
All right. Thanks.

1439
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:07,846
Thank you, Mr. Dugan. Thanks.

1440
01:38:18,357 --> 01:38:20,400
All right, let's get this one!

1441
01:38:22,653 --> 01:38:25,948
All right, come on!
We need some runs out there.

1442
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:28,909
Come on, we need runs.
Make something happen, Mae!

1443
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:31,370
All-the-Way Mae!

1444
01:38:31,537 --> 01:38:35,082
-They love her.
-Come on, now, let's go, let's go!

1445
01:38:35,874 --> 01:38:38,627
-Come on, now.
-Very cute. Thanks.

1446
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:41,380
Come on, Mae. Come on, bring her in!

1447
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,258
Come on, Kit.

1448
01:38:50,264 --> 01:38:52,391
-Safe!
-She's safe!

1449
01:38:54,351 --> 01:38:57,813
Way to play! Way to run!
Way to make something happen! Yeah!

1450
01:38:59,898 --> 01:39:01,608
Nice! Come on, Doris!

1451
01:39:02,234 --> 01:39:03,652
Safe!

1452
01:39:07,364 --> 01:39:09,032
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1453
01:39:13,537 --> 01:39:17,249
You get a hit, I'll babysit that little porker!
Come on!

1454
01:39:23,338 --> 01:39:24,381
You're out!

1455
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:31,722
Come on! Bring me home, Helen!
Bring me home.

1456
01:39:41,648 --> 01:39:43,358
-Out!
-Yes.

1457
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:47,905
Peaches are down to their final out.

1458
01:39:48,363 --> 01:39:51,950
But with tying and go-ahead runs
in scoring position.

1459
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:54,703
Big Dottie Hinson striding to the plate.

1460
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:58,332
Okay, let's get out of this inning!
Come on!

1461
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:00,375
Let's go.

1462
01:40:13,597 --> 01:40:16,099
Throw smoke, Kit! Throw smoke!

1463
01:40:23,815 --> 01:40:25,776
Here's the pitch.

1464
01:40:27,653 --> 01:40:30,364
Bite me on the butt
and call me an apple!

1465
01:40:30,531 --> 01:40:32,407
She nearly took her head off!

1466
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:34,743
-Get it in!
-Mordabito scores!

1467
01:40:37,329 --> 01:40:38,539
Come on, come on!

1468
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:40,541
-Murphy, she will score!
-Throw it!

1469
01:40:40,707 --> 01:40:46,755
And Rockford has taken the lead,
2 to 1! Oh, doctor!

1470
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:48,215
That's my wife!

1471
01:40:53,387 --> 01:40:55,931
It's okay, Kit! It's okay!

1472
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:04,606
One more!

1473
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:06,692
Keep it going!

1474
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:12,906
Put it past the little queen here.
Put it past her.

1475
01:41:13,073 --> 01:41:14,616
Right past her!

1476
01:41:15,325 --> 01:41:17,369
There's a fly ball to left field.

1477
01:41:17,536 --> 01:41:20,622
On her horse. She'll have to go
for this one to the stands!

1478
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:23,166
For the final out to retire the side.

1479
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:25,210
But the damage has been done.

1480
01:41:25,377 --> 01:41:29,089
Right here in Racine,
Rockford leads our Belles, 2 to 1

1481
01:41:29,256 --> 01:41:31,884
as we go to the bottom of the 9th.

1482
01:41:32,426 --> 01:41:35,470
Come on, it's okay.
You gotta bat now. Relax!

1483
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:39,224
Kit, one run and we are back
in this ball game.

1484
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:42,144
Shake it off. You gotta hit.

1485
01:41:47,858 --> 01:41:49,735
It's okay, Kit.

1486
01:41:53,238 --> 01:41:57,159
Okay, come on now.
Make her pitch to you. Let's go.

1487
01:41:57,326 --> 01:41:59,745
Hey, come on. Strike her out.
Strike her out!

1488
01:41:59,912 --> 01:42:02,331
Bear down! Bear down now, blond girl!
Come on!

1489
01:42:06,043 --> 01:42:08,378
First pitch, she drives it to deep centre!

1490
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:10,214
Mordabito goes back to the wall

1491
01:42:10,672 --> 01:42:13,217
and makes the catch!

1492
01:42:13,383 --> 01:42:16,678
Oh, beautiful catch!

1493
01:42:16,845 --> 01:42:18,263
Beautiful!

1494
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:21,683
Gotlander's pitch,

1495
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:24,853
and it is in the dirt! Ball 1!

1496
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:27,189
Ellen Sue, Ellen Sue, Ellen Sue!

1497
01:42:27,356 --> 01:42:29,983
That looked good to me, Ellen Sue!

1498
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:32,611
Shake that one off now!
Shake that one off!

1499
01:42:32,778 --> 01:42:35,864
That ain't nothing!
That ain't nothing!

1500
01:42:36,782 --> 01:42:39,618
Gotlander, she delivers. And...

1501
01:42:39,785 --> 01:42:42,454
Swings! There's a ground ball
between first and second.

1502
01:42:42,621 --> 01:42:43,747
This ball has eyes.

1503
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:46,583
Hendricks will go up at first
with a base hit.

1504
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:52,631
That's all right. One down!
We got one down! Let's go!

1505
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,639
Foul ball! Hinson's chasing after it.

1506
01:43:00,806 --> 01:43:01,890
Don't touch it!

1507
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:03,392
Did she get it?

1508
01:43:04,184 --> 01:43:06,228
She got it! She got it!

1509
01:43:08,438 --> 01:43:11,233
There's no question
who the star of this game is.

1510
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,529
Dottie Hinson has her team
one out from the title.

1511
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:18,323
There you go. There you go!

1512
01:43:20,117 --> 01:43:23,704
Come on, Kit, you're up.
You're the hitter now. Let's go.

1513
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:28,876
You can do it, you can do it.

1514
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:33,714
The last batter standing
in Rockford's way is Kit Keller.

1515
01:43:33,881 --> 01:43:36,216
Kit is 1 for 3 today.

1516
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:48,145
-Can I have a time-out?
-Time!

1517
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:04,036
High fastballs. She can't hit them,
can't lay off them.

1518
01:44:04,203 --> 01:44:05,245
All right.

1519
01:44:05,704 --> 01:44:09,917
All right, if we just hold them now,
we got it! Come on!

1520
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:11,543
Come on, Ellen Sue!

1521
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:14,004
One, two, three! One, two, three!

1522
01:44:21,762 --> 01:44:22,846
Play ball!

1523
01:44:30,437 --> 01:44:32,940
-Strike!
-Swing and a miss. Strike 1!

1524
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:35,400
Oh, yes! Yes! Thank you, God!

1525
01:44:35,567 --> 01:44:38,278
Lay off the high ones!

1526
01:44:47,079 --> 01:44:48,455
Here's the pitch.

1527
01:44:48,622 --> 01:44:51,250
Swing and a miss! Strike 2!

1528
01:44:54,503 --> 01:44:58,882
Ellen Sue! One more! One more!

1529
01:45:17,484 --> 01:45:19,152
Here's the pitch.

1530
01:45:20,112 --> 01:45:24,199
And it's a long fly ball.
Back, back, back.

1531
01:45:24,741 --> 01:45:25,826
It falls in there!

1532
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:27,995
No one'll get to this ball!

1533
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:30,998
This should tie it up!
Hendricks is rounding third!

1534
01:45:31,164 --> 01:45:33,500
She will score!

1535
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:35,961
Keller is heading for third!

1536
01:45:36,128 --> 01:45:40,007
Gardner hits the relay man
with a frozen rope!

1537
01:45:42,009 --> 01:45:46,388
The coach is giving Keller the stop sign
at third! But she is not stopping!

1538
01:45:46,555 --> 01:45:48,182
She runs through the stop sign!

1539
01:45:48,348 --> 01:45:49,975
She is not stopping!

1540
01:45:50,142 --> 01:45:51,894
Here comes the throw!

1541
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,478
It should be in time!

1542
01:45:53,562 --> 01:45:54,688
And...

1543
01:46:05,949 --> 01:46:07,784
Safe!

1544
01:46:09,578 --> 01:46:12,080
She is safe! I can't believe it!

1545
01:46:12,247 --> 01:46:13,916
Hinson dropped the ball!

1546
01:46:14,082 --> 01:46:15,584
Hinson dropped the ball!

1547
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:19,880
The ball game is over!
Racine has won the game, 3 to 2,

1548
01:46:20,047 --> 01:46:22,049
and the World Series!

1549
01:46:22,758 --> 01:46:25,844
Take me home, Mama,
and put me to bed!

1550
01:46:26,011 --> 01:46:30,224
I have seen enough to know
I have seen too much!

1551
01:46:38,815 --> 01:46:41,735
Kit, Kit, Kit.

1552
01:47:06,593 --> 01:47:08,720
Come on. You played a good game.

1553
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:17,187
Thank you! Thank you!

1554
01:47:19,857 --> 01:47:21,775
Well, Walter, what do you say?

1555
01:47:22,526 --> 01:47:24,069
All right, Ira.

1556
01:47:24,236 --> 01:47:25,988
We'll stick with it.

1557
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:30,075
My mother always used to say,
"If at first you don't succeed--"

1558
01:47:30,242 --> 01:47:33,370
You don't have to spend
the next six months in Saskatchewan.

1559
01:47:33,537 --> 01:47:37,374
-Alice, you told me it's lovely.
-Yeah, if you like ice fishing.

1560
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:39,626
I thought we were gonna win, I swear.

1561
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:42,713
-Well, we didn't.
-Up to that last inning, we had it.

1562
01:47:43,547 --> 01:47:46,383
I'm so depressed, I could eat a cow.

1563
01:47:47,384 --> 01:47:49,261
Hey, Dottie. It's all right.

1564
01:47:49,428 --> 01:47:50,846
You know?

1565
01:47:51,013 --> 01:47:52,598
You did good.

1566
01:47:54,266 --> 01:47:56,476
Get dressed. See you on the bus.

1567
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:59,563
Thanks, Mae.

1568
01:48:03,483 --> 01:48:05,027
Here. Thanks.

1569
01:48:05,194 --> 01:48:07,196
Wanna be a ballplayer
when you get big?

1570
01:48:07,362 --> 01:48:08,405
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1571
01:48:08,572 --> 01:48:11,992
-What's your name? Angelina.
-Angelina.

1572
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:17,164
Here you go.

1573
01:48:17,331 --> 01:48:19,541
You gotta practise really hard.

1574
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:20,834
What's your name?

1575
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:23,170
-Hi. How much are these?
-Help yourself.

1576
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:24,505
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1577
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:27,174
-Hitting!
-You all like hitting better?

1578
01:48:27,341 --> 01:48:29,927
-What's your name? Mary.
-Mary.

1579
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:33,680
-Who you rooting for?
-Racine!

1580
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:36,183
That's what I thought you said.

1581
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:37,476
Yeah.

1582
01:48:37,643 --> 01:48:40,687
Okay, well, you guys be good.
Get dirty.

1583
01:48:41,855 --> 01:48:44,233
-Bye!
-Bye, Kit!

1584
01:48:48,487 --> 01:48:51,615
Dottie, look...

1585
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:56,119
-I'm sorry I knocked you over.
-No, you're not.

1586
01:48:56,537 --> 01:48:59,206
You blocked the entire plate!
How do you expect--?

1587
01:48:59,373 --> 01:49:03,794
You did what you had to. You just beat me.
You wanted it more than me.

1588
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:07,798
I jammed my shoulder,
if it makes you feel any better.

1589
01:49:09,716 --> 01:49:11,009
A little.

1590
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:17,808
Bob and I are driving back to Oregon.
You're welcome to come with us.

1591
01:49:19,017 --> 01:49:21,645
No. You two should be alone.

1592
01:49:21,812 --> 01:49:23,605
I'd just be in the way.

1593
01:49:23,772 --> 01:49:26,233
When do you think
you'll be coming home?

1594
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:31,738
Well, some of the girls talked about
staying around here and getting jobs.

1595
01:49:32,573 --> 01:49:34,491
I really like it here.

1596
01:49:34,825 --> 01:49:36,243
Christmas?

1597
01:49:39,705 --> 01:49:43,375
I... I don't know. But you're
coming back next year, right?

1598
01:49:43,959 --> 01:49:45,169
No.

1599
01:49:45,335 --> 01:49:47,629
I wanna have kids.
We wanna have kids.

1600
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:51,175
Dottie, you got plenty of time
to have kids.

1601
01:49:52,009 --> 01:49:54,178
You couldn't give this up.
You'd miss it.

1602
01:49:54,344 --> 01:49:57,639
Miss it?
Miss putting on all this gear?

1603
01:49:57,806 --> 01:50:01,476
Catching a double-header in 100-degree
heat? Pushing the bus in mud?

1604
01:50:01,643 --> 01:50:05,063
Getting slammed into every other day
by a base runner?

1605
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:07,149
Think I'm gonna miss that?

1606
01:50:07,691 --> 01:50:09,234
Yeah.

1607
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:13,071
-I'll tell you what I'll miss.
-What?

1608
01:50:14,114 --> 01:50:15,866
Well, I'll miss the girls.

1609
01:50:16,992 --> 01:50:18,035
I'll miss you, Kit.

1610
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,329
Me?

1611
01:50:21,371 --> 01:50:23,582
Yeah. How many sisters
do you think I have?

1612
01:50:27,961 --> 01:50:29,379
I love you, Kit.

1613
01:50:31,048 --> 01:50:33,133
-Really?
-Yeah.

1614
01:50:34,343 --> 01:50:37,262
Just when I want you to stay,
you're leaving.

1615
01:50:45,521 --> 01:50:48,482
Well, thank you for getting me
into the league, Dottie.

1616
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:52,277
You got yourself in the league.
I got you on the train.

1617
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,404
Play great.

1618
01:50:55,697 --> 01:50:57,282
Like you.

1619
01:50:59,243 --> 01:51:02,913
You stay in touch, you hear?
Come home every once in a while.

1620
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:07,251
If you don't, I'll come back
and hit line drives at your head, okay?

1621
01:51:07,417 --> 01:51:08,919
Go on.

1622
01:51:11,129 --> 01:51:12,714
I love you.

1623
01:51:15,926 --> 01:51:18,011
And you are gonna miss this.

1624
01:51:18,512 --> 01:51:21,431
-I don't care what you say.
-Yeah.

1625
01:51:23,475 --> 01:51:26,061
-There's the winner!
-Good game, Jimmy.

1626
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:28,605
-Good game, good manager.
-Jimmy Dugan.

1627
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:30,816
-Hi, I'm a big fan of yours.
-Hi. Yeah?

1628
01:51:30,983 --> 01:51:32,818
I'm Dottie's husband.

1629
01:51:33,277 --> 01:51:37,114
Oh, hey, hey.
Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.

1630
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:44,454
-Yeah.
-Well...

1631
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:46,415
Old man Harvey just

1632
01:51:46,582 --> 01:51:49,418
offered me a job
managing next year in Wichita.

1633
01:51:50,752 --> 01:51:52,963
Triple A? That's great. Good luck.

1634
01:51:53,130 --> 01:51:54,339
I turned him down.

1635
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,801
-Why?
-What do you mean, why?

1636
01:51:57,968 --> 01:51:59,553
I already got a job.

1637
01:52:04,099 --> 01:52:05,517
I'll see you.

1638
01:52:05,684 --> 01:52:07,644
-All right.
-Okay.

1639
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:11,315
Miss Cuthbert, save me
my special seat, now, cutie!

1640
01:52:11,481 --> 01:52:13,108
Meet you at the hotel.

1641
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:18,363
Really, Dad, thank you for coming.
It was such a surprise to me.

1642
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:23,076
Hey, did you see Mae's catch, Dad?

1643
01:52:23,243 --> 01:52:26,872
I'd rather see you play ball
than that other stuff you used to do.

1644
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:30,334
What are you saying that for?
You make her feel bad! All right.

1645
01:52:30,501 --> 01:52:31,627
Steak dinner.

1646
01:52:31,793 --> 01:52:33,879
On you. All right, I'll see you later.

1647
01:52:34,046 --> 01:52:35,714
Kit, over here! Come on, let's go!

1648
01:52:35,797 --> 01:52:38,592
Kit, come on!
Come on, let's get going!

1649
01:52:38,759 --> 01:52:41,929
-Bye!
-Goodbye, sweetie!

1650
01:52:47,643 --> 01:52:49,561
-That was Bob, huh?
-Yeah.

1651
01:52:49,728 --> 01:52:51,438
Nice guy.

1652
01:52:51,605 --> 01:52:54,566
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Well...

1653
01:52:56,944 --> 01:52:58,612
Hey, Kit.

1654
01:52:59,571 --> 01:53:01,114
Lay off of those high ones.

1655
01:53:02,449 --> 01:53:03,825
I like the high ones.

1656
01:53:04,743 --> 01:53:06,370
-Mule!
-Nag!

1657
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,241
-Hey, Mae. Come here.
-What?

1658
01:53:45,117 --> 01:53:46,785
-What do you want?
-Come here.

1659
01:53:46,952 --> 01:53:48,704
-Come here, come here.
-What?

1660
01:53:48,871 --> 01:53:50,330
-What is it?
-Look at her.

1661
01:53:51,123 --> 01:53:52,291
Hey.

1662
01:53:52,749 --> 01:53:53,709
Dottie?

1663
01:53:56,712 --> 01:53:57,880
It's Dottie.

1664
01:53:59,923 --> 01:54:01,175
Hey, Doris.

1665
01:54:03,177 --> 01:54:05,596
-Dottie!
-Hi.

1666
01:54:06,597 --> 01:54:08,599
Mae? All-the-Way Mae?

1667
01:54:08,765 --> 01:54:11,310
-No one's called me that since--
-Last night!

1668
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:14,688
-I'm a married woman now.
-Yeah, about eight times.

1669
01:54:14,855 --> 01:54:17,733
Hey, girls! Look who's here!

1670
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:19,193
Shirley?

1671
01:54:19,693 --> 01:54:21,653
-Oh, Shirley!
-Dottie.

1672
01:54:23,322 --> 01:54:25,282
Helen Haley!

1673
01:54:25,449 --> 01:54:29,870
-It's Dr Haley now. I'm a doctor.
-I always knew you would be.

1674
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:32,164
-Who's that?
-That's Dottie Hinson.

1675
01:54:32,789 --> 01:54:33,832
Betty Spaghetti.

1676
01:54:33,999 --> 01:54:36,793
-Oh, hi, Betty.
-Best ballplayer in the league.

1677
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,546
-I don't remember her.
-She only played one year.

1678
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:42,090
Oh, Ellen Sue!

1679
01:54:42,925 --> 01:54:46,303
-Hi!
-You haven't changed one bit.

1680
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:49,932
Dottie, I married a plastic surgeon.

1681
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:53,227
Dottie, having you here is good luck.

1682
01:54:53,393 --> 01:54:55,020
Thanks, Alice.

1683
01:54:57,397 --> 01:54:58,899
Dottie?

1684
01:55:04,905 --> 01:55:06,114
Marla.

1685
01:55:06,949 --> 01:55:09,952
-Oh, Marla.
-Dottie.

1686
01:55:10,118 --> 01:55:12,329
I'm so glad you're here.

1687
01:55:12,496 --> 01:55:15,541
-How's...? Yeah.
-Nelson? He's good.

1688
01:55:15,707 --> 01:55:19,920
He's retired.
Our son runs the business.

1689
01:55:20,796 --> 01:55:21,839
How's Bob?

1690
01:55:22,256 --> 01:55:24,466
Oh, you know. He's...

1691
01:55:26,385 --> 01:55:29,638
-When?
-Just this winter.

1692
01:55:31,265 --> 01:55:32,850
I'm sorry.

1693
01:55:36,687 --> 01:55:40,732
-We finally made it.
-Oh, Shirley, I'm so excited.

1694
01:55:40,899 --> 01:55:42,860
I've got butterflies in my stomach!

1695
01:55:43,026 --> 01:55:47,155
They've got a "Women In Baseball"
thing up there. Isn't it neat?

1696
01:55:47,322 --> 01:55:50,325
Baseball Hall of Fame.
I'm shaking.

1697
01:55:50,492 --> 01:55:52,828
Wait a minute here. Dottie?

1698
01:55:52,995 --> 01:55:55,455
-Guess who that is.
-Who?

1699
01:55:58,166 --> 01:55:59,668
Hi, Dottie.

1700
01:56:01,336 --> 01:56:04,631
You remember?
You're gonna lose.

1701
01:56:07,467 --> 01:56:08,760
Stilwell, angel!

1702
01:56:09,678 --> 01:56:10,846
My goodness!

1703
01:56:12,264 --> 01:56:13,515
Where's your mom?

1704
01:56:14,308 --> 01:56:17,728
Mom died a couple years ago.

1705
01:56:17,895 --> 01:56:21,398
Oh, I'm sorry.
She was a real nice lady.

1706
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:23,984
And a damn fine ballplayer.

1707
01:56:24,443 --> 01:56:25,903
Yeah.

1708
01:56:27,362 --> 01:56:29,656
When I heard about this, I...

1709
01:56:32,034 --> 01:56:33,535
just felt like I

1710
01:56:33,702 --> 01:56:35,537
owed it to her to be here.

1711
01:56:35,704 --> 01:56:39,541
She always said it was the best time
she ever had in her whole life.

1712
01:56:41,210 --> 01:56:44,129
Stilwell, come here.

1713
01:56:47,633 --> 01:56:49,676
You recognise yourself?

1714
01:56:52,679 --> 01:56:55,265
-Can I get one of those?
-Sure. Of course.

1715
01:57:18,205 --> 01:57:21,500
Ladies! Ladies!

1716
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:24,419
It's a pleasure
to welcome you here today.

1717
01:57:24,586 --> 01:57:27,339
It's taken years,
but you are the first women

1718
01:57:27,506 --> 01:57:31,885
ever to be inducted
into the Baseball Hall of Fame!

1719
01:57:33,428 --> 01:57:36,348
-And now--
-Wait. Wait a minute.

1720
01:57:37,057 --> 01:57:39,393
This really isn't right.

1721
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:41,061
Mr. Lowenstein,

1722
01:57:41,228 --> 01:57:44,690
since you kept the league going
all those years...

1723
01:57:46,608 --> 01:57:47,860
well, you do it.

1724
01:57:49,027 --> 01:57:51,864
-There you go, Ira.
-Thank you, Bob.

1725
01:57:54,241 --> 01:57:55,659
Ladies...

1726
01:57:57,661 --> 01:57:59,204
it's my honour.

1727
01:58:12,593 --> 01:58:17,514
Mr. Capadino, look!
That's when you changed my life, honey!

1728
01:58:29,943 --> 01:58:32,821
And, oh, that's great!

1729
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:50,047
Stilwell, angel, smile!

1730
01:59:07,606 --> 01:59:10,359
Batter up

1731
01:59:10,776 --> 01:59:13,028
Hear that call

1732
01:59:13,904 --> 01:59:16,615
The time has come

1733
01:59:17,616 --> 01:59:20,118
For one and all

1734
01:59:21,703 --> 01:59:25,332
To play

1735
01:59:25,499 --> 01:59:27,793
Ball

1736
01:59:28,418 --> 01:59:31,421
We're the members of

1737
01:59:31,588 --> 01:59:33,757
The All-American League

1738
01:59:33,924 --> 01:59:36,927
We come from cities

1739
01:59:37,094 --> 01:59:39,763
Near and far

1740
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:42,558
We've got Canadians

1741
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:44,935
Irish ones and Swedes

1742
01:59:45,102 --> 01:59:48,063
We're all for one
We're one for all

1743
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:50,649
We're All-American

1744
01:59:50,816 --> 01:59:54,695
-Look.
-Is that you, Grandma?

1745
01:59:56,488 --> 01:59:58,866
Her motto, do or die

1746
01:59:59,032 --> 02:00:01,243
She's not the one to use

1747
02:00:01,410 --> 02:00:06,415
Or need an alibi

1748
02:00:13,213 --> 02:00:15,299
Oh, Kit.

1749
02:00:19,803 --> 02:00:22,014
I'm so glad you came.

1750
02:00:23,432 --> 02:00:25,517
Hi, Aunt Dottie.

1751
02:00:31,273 --> 02:00:33,150
Take a picture.

1752
02:00:33,942 --> 02:00:38,614
Let's take a picture of the whole team.
The original Peaches!

1753
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:42,451
Hey, come on, come on. Okay.

1754
02:05:47,965 --> 02:05:49,508
Strike!

1755
02:05:49,675 --> 02:05:52,803
That was clear inside.
It was clear inside, clear inside.

1756
02:05:52,970 --> 02:05:55,556
-That's three times.
-That's my opinion.

1757
02:05:57,850 --> 02:06:00,686
Yesterday or tomorrow,
that might be a ball,

1758
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:03,021
but today, it was a strike!
