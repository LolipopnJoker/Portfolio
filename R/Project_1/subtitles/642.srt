doing a paper on law enforcement.

178
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,219
I'm helping her get an inside look.

179
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,597
I bet she'll do the same for you.

180
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,100
Gracie, I would love to get
a woman's point of view.

181
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,645
You're barking up the wrong tree.
Right, Hart?

182
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,442
Do all the women have to wear
those really masculine shoes?

183
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,407
I get these made special by the guy
that put the tattoo on my ass.

184
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,410
We'll leave you with Ben and Jerry.
Catch you later.

185
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,288
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

186
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,626
Hope you have a good time at the mall.

187
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,544
Wohop is the place.

188
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,089
Wohop is good, but if you like
variety, you go to La Chinita Linda.

189
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,758
Their rice and beans are slamming.

190
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,677
I don't want variety.
I get pork fried rice every...

191
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,097
I figured it out! I tried to create
a content-based pattern...

192
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,599
...similar to his previous letters.

193
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,643
But this time, he used a signifier.

194
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,187
In this case, the word "miss"...

195
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,982
...in the subsequent letters.
Will you let me finish?

196
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,193
It's the Miss United States Pageant.

197
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,196
Yeah. Intelligence thought so too.

198
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,864
What do we got?

199
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,534
Miss United States from San Antonio,
Texas, home of the Alamo.

200
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,078
I forgot the Alamo.

201
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,456
The pageant lasts three days.
Preliminaries, conferences...

202
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,542
...the live telecast.
It's a logistical nightmare.

203
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,044
Not just a babe-fest.

204
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,631
Jesus, we've only got 48 hours.

205
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,967
Okay, gentlemen.

206
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,219
Where do we start?

207
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,641
I got a cousin in Texas.

208
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,979
You might want to call the network and
pageant people. Set up a meeting.

209
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,317
Because you'll probably need
their cooperation.

210
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,069
Yeah.

211
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,405
Yeah, I can do that. Let's do that.

212
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,240
What about jurisdiction?

213
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,993
The Citizen has been ours
from the start.

214
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,578
You might want to call San Antonio.

215
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,039
Grease some wheels so they like us...

216
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,833
...when we need manpower and tech.

217
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,418
While I'm at it, let's do that.

218
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,752
Good idea.

219
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,714
He loves to make a splash.
His target will be public...

220
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,717
...like one of these outdoor prelims
or a TV broadcast.

221
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,760
Telecasters at the convention center.

222
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,723
We're gonna need surveillance
on the interior perimeter.

223
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,517
We'll need more.
There's a million places...

224
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,354
...only these bikini-stuffers can go:
backstage areas, hotel rooms...

225
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,440
We need to get somebody in there.

226
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,859
Yeah! Now I'm thinking...

227
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,777
...undercover.

228
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,446
Good idea, boss.

229
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,031
I got just the girl.

230
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,869
- Huh? Huh?
- All right.

231
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,912
That's nothing. Check this out.

232
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,458
Compliments of my daughter:
the "Dress Up Sally" web site.

233
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,969
What did I tell you? Hot, right?

234
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,220
Yeah, baby.

235
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,723
You got a little problem.

236
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,266
She's perfect!

237
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,642
Look to the left.

238
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,146
Down... down...

239
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,191
HART: There you go.
ERIC: "On maternity leave"?

240
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,650
That's not gonna work.

241
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,570
Not unless it's
"The Miss Lamaze Pageant. "

242
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,286
Can you do a search?

243
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,331
Female field agents under 35.

244
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,761
Jensen, Jensen!

245
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,015
[MUMBLING AND LAUGHING]

246
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,818
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got it, I got it!

247
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,788
Oh, no!

248
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,289
That's right, that's right!

249
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,379
You think that's good?
Check this out.

250
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,047
I got the winner right here.

251
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,340
Scorekeepers ready?

252
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,223
This is the best part.

253
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,063
Oh!

254
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,404
He's right behind me, isn't he?

255
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,531
Not really my color, is it?

256
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,908
Sir, we were just...

257
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,245
...looking for someone
to go undercover at the pageant.

258
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,165
And I'm the best we have.

259
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,292
It doesn't inspire much confidence.

260
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,419
Get back to work.

261
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,590
- Hart, shouldn't you be at a desk?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,677
You don't say anything?
Made me look like an idiot.

263
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,513
HART:
Do I have eyes in the back of my head?

264
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,266
- He was standing right behind me.
- What were we gonna say?

265
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,559
- What?
JENSEN: This one.

266
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,936
ERIC:
Are you kidding? It's Hart.

267
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,522
Cut it off. Let's go back to work.

268
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,819
Very funny.

269
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,571
Hold on. That's not bad.

270
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:03,367
Hold on, nothing. Hit the save button
because you won't see that again.

271
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,459
- What do you say?
- No freaking way.

272
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,752
Why not?

273
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,796
I won't parade around in a swimsuit
like some bimbo...

274
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,884
...named Gracie Lou Freebush,
and all she wants is world peace.

275
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,553
It wouldn't be like that.

276
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,972
You'd be on the undercover team.

277
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,058
Right. In a thong.

278
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,645
In a tasteful one-piece!

279
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,397
You do a few butt-shaping exercises...

280
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,982
...you could pull this off.

281
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,776
You know what? Pull this off.

282
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,653
Is it because McDonald hates me?

283
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,988
Or is it, like, a woman thing?

284
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,869
Don't kid yourself.
Nobody thinks of you that way.

285
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,251
He's punishing me, isn't he?

286
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,836
I had to beg him to let you do this.

287
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,673
That's right. Like it or not,
you screwed up, pal.

288
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,258
Sit down, sit down.

289
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,184
I've never been in a beauty pageant.

290
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,521
I don't even own a dress.
I don't even own a brush.

291
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,314
Ow, Jesus. Oh.

292
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,527
Which part of that
is supposed to shock me?

293
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,204
Let's suspend reality for a second...

294
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,872
...and pretend I said yes.

295
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,166
I got to do everything? Like...

296
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,003
...the whole big hair
and the makeup and...

297
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,212
Damn right.

298
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,675
The spinning, the twirling, the
smiling, the cute little tap number.

299
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,386
Hundred bucks on Matthews.

300
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,930
I don't know. She's got rage.

301
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,976
I'll take that bet.

302
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,321
- That's right. That's right.
- Yeah!

303
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,239
Yeah, baby.

304
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,242
So you're saying...

305
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,828
...I have to wear the bathing suit?

306
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,332
Yeah, you have
to wear the bathing suit.

307
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,250
Okay.

308
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,421
You go, girl.

309
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,092
Where am I gonna put my gun?

310
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,845
No place I want to know about.

311
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,392
What could possibly motivate anybody
to enter a beauty pageant?

312
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,895
Scholarship money,
a chance to see the world...

313
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,980
...broaden your horizons...

314
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,525
So join the Marines. It's like
feminism never even happened.

315
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,780
Any woman that does this is catering
to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality.

316
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,074
I dated Young Miss Scarsdale.

317
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,242
Can you really be this superficial?

318
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,119
Hard to believe, right?

319
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,371
Here we are.

320
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,624
ERIC: Therefore, we'd like to use
one of our team undercover.

321
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,542
Am I hearing this correctly?

322
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:03,130
Kathy, these people want
to put one of their agents...

323
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,799
...in the pageant.

324
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,133
They want her to win?

325
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,010
No, ma'am.

326
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,097
We will need your help
with the judging...

327
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,641
...so our agent is in the top five...

328
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,811
...to have access to
all the areas at all times.

329
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,313
- Absolutely not.
HART: Miss Morningside...

330
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,732
...we understand how important
this beauty pageant...

331
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,317
Excuse me.

332
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,736
This is not a beauty pageant.

333
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,988
This is a scholarship program.

334
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,950
And it has been ever since my reign.

335
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,161
I fully intend on maintaining
that credo.

336
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,788
ERIC:
Absolutely, Miss Morningside.

337
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,624
We're here to protect the girls.
Women.

338
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,084
Scholarship ladies.

339
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,589
There's nothing more important to me
than the safety of my girls.

340
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,676
I'd rather cancel the pageant
than have them blown up.

341
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,803
Especially without their knowledge.

342
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,682
We went to the network to cancel,
but they refused.

343
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,100
We can't force them.

344
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,811
I'm confused.

345
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,855
What state is she going to be from?

346
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,023
All the winners have been chosen.

347
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,862
We recently discovered some
information about Miss New Jersey.

348
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,699
And her performance in a little
film called Arma Get It On.

349
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,868
Was that her?

350
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,494
Oh, yeah!

Would you get these people
Victor's number, please?

364
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,745
And get me a spring water.

365
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,580
And tuck in your shirt.

366
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,918
That, that was... a water for you...

367
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,419

372
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,073
If you are Grace Hart,
I quit here and now.

However, I can't accept this job.

378
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,964
There's no way I can make
this woman ready in two days.

379
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,717
Please, Mr. Melling,
give it a chance. Sit down.

380

Have lunch. Totally on the Bureau.

381
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,932
I suppose that would be
the civilized thing to do.

382
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:05,312
I'll take a rain check.
I got to take care of some FBl stuff.

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,315
That thing I told you
about that I gotta do.

384
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,485
But I'll see you later.
We'll hang out. You like caps?

385
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,321
I'll get you an official FBl cap.

386
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,198
See you later.

387
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,409
What a pity.

388
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,495
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

389
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,706
- Yes.
- Yeah.

390
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,334
It is always "yes,"
never "yeah. " Sit down.

391
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,631
Miss United States is always
well-spoken and polite.

392
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,091
Do you understand?

393
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,634
Watch the hands, garçon.

394
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,469
- Excuse me.
VICTOR: It's all right.

395
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,181
I have a feeling we're going to need
a drop cloth later.

396
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,447
VICTOR: Could I have another
cabernet sauvignon?

397
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,198
Another keg for you?

398
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,285
- I'm good, thanks.
VICTOR: That's okay, Philip.

399
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:05,205
So, how long have you been doing
this pageant-training thing?

400
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,373
I'm sorry?

401
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:11,378
What was the question? I was
distracted by a half-masticated cow...

402
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,548
...rolling around
in your wide-open trap.

403
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,550
Excuse me? What is your problem?

404
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,885
- Problem?
- Yeah.

405
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,679
I mean, yes.
Have I offended you in some way?

406
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,892
You've been completely antagonistic
to me from the second I walked in.

407
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,853
I was once the most
sought-after, highly paid...

408
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,189
...consultant in pageant history.

409
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,399
I had no idea.

410
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:37,404
Every season, girls would plead
with me to train them.

411
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,865
Ten out of 11 years...

412
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,076
...my girls were crowned.

413
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,788
The year we lost,
the winner was a deaf-mute.

414
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,706
You can't beat that.

415
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,335
Then...

416
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,921
...in '96...

417
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,008
...my girl froze like a puddle halfway
through her aria from La Bohème.

418
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,845
Afterwards, she told
a reporter from Pageant Magazine...

419
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,806
...that I was a perfectionist...

420
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,685
...who had harangued her
to within an inch of her sanity.

421
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:11,438
Of course,
after that article came out...

422
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,775
...nobody wanted me.

423
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,615
Okay. With all due respect here...

00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,326
...why did Miss Morningside
suggest you?

425
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,287
Because I am the best.

426
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,129
Or perhaps it's because everyone else
worth having had a contestant.

427
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,717
They had their Southern belles,
their Midwestern farmers' daughters.

since Jurassic Park.

Don't look down, don't look down.

Don't look down, look up. Your chin
should be parallel to the floor.

00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,574
Here. Take these.

702
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,886
What, no armored car?

703
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,180
That would be in my other dress.

704
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,935
What are you planning to do
for your talent? Sing? Dance?

705
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,104
Chew with your mouth closed?

706
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,606
I'll do whatever you want, Yoda.

707
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,233
Oh, Lord.

708
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,194
Agent Matthews!

709
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,365
- This woman has no talent!
- Don't shout it in front of her.

710
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:53,202
I wasn't told to provide a talent.
I can't do so in the next five hours!

711
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,537
Wait a minute.

712
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,122
What are you talking about?

713
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,791

with nothing to do...

...but convert oxygen
into carbon dioxide!

00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:06,132
You said you couldn't make her pretty
in two days, but she's gorgeous.

716
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,968
Compared to the car wreck
she was before.

and I have fulfilled them.

- Are you threatening me?

719
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,312
- Listen to me, you old fruitcake!
- How dare you, you cupcake!

720

There's something I know how to do.
I haven't done it since high school...

721
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,528
- You're not having sex on this stage.
- I didn't know it was an option.

722
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,406
This thing,
I just have to call room service.

723
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,158

724
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,659
Please.

725
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,457
Thank you. And the other one.

726
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,336
Thank you.

727
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,136
All right, all right, all right.

728
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,140
Happy, you doughnut Nazi?

729
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,598
Did I tell you Stan Fields
was getting fired?

730
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,352
I'm on it. You just concentrate
on being Gracie Lou, all right.

731
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,730
And by the way,
you're doing a great job.

732
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,692
I thought the evening gown looked...

733
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,737
- I totally bought it.
- I know, you think I'm gorgeous.

734
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,489
I don't think you're gorgeous.

735
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,492
You think I'm gorgeous.

736
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:59,120
You want to kiss me.

737
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,913
You want to hug me...

738
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,624

I'd rather kiss him.

739
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,211
...love me.
You want to hug me.

740
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,046
You want to smooch me.

741
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,683
Enjoy the rest of your night.

742
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,866

Oh, she had a busy night.

744
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,705
I saw that gentleman stop by the room.

00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,914
CHERYL:
Gentleman?

746
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,958
Uh-huh.

747
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:50,296
- No men in the room.
- It's different on the mainland.

748
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,591
Hold on, ladies. Let's hear
her side of the story.

750
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,180
Oh.

751
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,974
Oh, that guy? No.

752
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,686
No, no, I was dating him
for a little while because...

753
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,189
...he said he had
an incurable disease.

754
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,694
I didn't realize it was stupidity.

755
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,072
MARY JO: Oh, I know what that's like.
- All right.

756
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,948
He is such a pathetic loser.

757
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,119
I'm sorry he's obsessed with me,
but at some point it's like, "Hello!"

758
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,122
"Move on! Get over yourself!"

759
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,708
His ego is this big.

760
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,503
But his equipment is like this big!

761
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,006

I made it very clear you weren't
responsible for making her credible.

00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,951

NEWSCASTER: In a bizarre incident at
the Miss United States Preliminaries...

796
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,608
...the contestant from New Jersey
leapt off-stage...

797
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,779
...and tackled a man in the crowd
who was trying to light a cigarette.

00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,407
She's here with me right now.

799

What were you thinking when you
jumped off the stage?

All the contestants are actively
involved in ending tobacco dependence.

801
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:59,378
I think the gentleman will think twice
before he lights up again.

with a weapon is a suspect.

00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:13,137
Is this your idea of doing final preps
on the convention center?

smoking commercial. He's on his way.

00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,719

Oh, I have sarcasm?

874
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:35,844
When every word that comes out of your
mouth is dripping with disdain?

875
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:40,599
That is because I am a miserable,
grumpy elitist, and that works for me.

876
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,644
I don't have relationships
because I don't want them.

877
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,439
And I don't have friends
because I work 24-7.

878
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,943
And you have no idea why I am
the way that I am.

879
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,279
As we're practicing interviews,
why are you the way you are?

880
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,240
None of your damn business.

881
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,284
The judges probably have
never heard that before.

882
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,453
We have more to do here.

883
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,415
No, we are finished.

884
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,168
Finished.

885
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,966
- Give me a 20 on Matthews.
- Be advised he's at the pool.

886
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,972
"How do you feel about gun control?"

887
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,682
Favorable.

888
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,569
Thought I'd let you know
I was quitting. Take care.

889
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,071
Hold on. Wait a minute.

890
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,825
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you got the wrong girl.

891
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,076
All right?

892
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,411
I do not need this now.

893
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,331
That's what I'm saying!
I'm totally screwing up in there!

894
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,792
I don't feel
like a real agent anymore.

895
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,503
I mean, Vic says
this thing that's so...

896
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,299
I don't care what he said, you know?
I don't care.

897
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,009
Because I am the job...

898
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,803
...and I'm okay with that.
You're the job?

899
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,347
Yeah, I'm the job.
We're all the job.

900
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:04,474
Then what's wrong with me?

901
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:08,353
I date. I know everyone thinks
I haven't had a date in 10 years.

902
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,855
Is that what you think?

903
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,024
I think you date.

904
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,775
Damn right I do.

905
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,320
But both times it was screwed up.

906
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,865
I don't even care.
All I want to do...

907
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,950
...is my job.

908
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,370
For the last three days
I feel like I'm completely lost.

909
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,373
I've been waiting five years
to run my own op.

910
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,668
- Would I blow it on the wrong girl?
- You picked me...

911
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,838
...because I looked good
and wasn't on maternity leave.

912
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,050
No, that's why they let me pick you.
Know why?

913
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,052
- Lost a bet.
- You're smart...

914
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:44,681
...and funny and you're easy
to talk to when you're unarmed.

915
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,810
Give yourself a break
and cut Vic some slack.

916
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,480
Because if they see
what I see, then...

917
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,066
...they'll love you.

918
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,404
So, what do you say?

919
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,079
I won't let you down.

920
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,081
Good, that's what I want to hear.

921
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,334
In all honesty, I might let you down.

922
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,796
But I'll try my best not to.

923
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,509
Do not mess with the dress.

924
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,935
Oh, Vic is gonna kill you.

925
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,562
You in big trouble.

926
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,398
Why? You fell.

927
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,108
- You look good wet.
- Shut up!

928
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,125
Whoa, guys, Hart's
in the dressing room. Come on.

929
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,461
HARRIS: You see the legs on that girl?
CLONSKY: Who's your daddy?

930
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,146
Those better be candy dishes!

931
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,647
Turn around.

932
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,484
Open.

933
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,488
This guy's like an inch from death!

934
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,908
AGENT:
But what a way to go!

935
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,828
- Break it up. Nothing to see.
- What do you mean?

936
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,955
She's a federal agent.
Come on.

937
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:38,128
Guess it's time to apply
at my local Hooters.

938
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:42,174
Hemorrhoid ointment? You think
the judges will look that closely?

939
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,509
It's for the baggies under your eyes.

940
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,886
Really?

941
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,890
Good, hair spray.
Finally something I recognize.

942
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:52,392
What are you doing?

943
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,770
It stops the suit from riding up.

944
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:55,979
Riding up where?

945
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,190
Just up!

946
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,399
That's enough!

947
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,026
Why do you make things hard?

948
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,780
I can see this is an incredibly
embarrassing situation for you.

949
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,450
Why does Georgia get to wear
a one-piece and I have to wear this?!

950
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:12,621
If you can do this, then you can
convince anyone that you belong here.

951
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,414
Places, everybody! Let's go!

952
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:19,961
The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts
for 15% of the total score...

953
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,715
...and tests the grace,
athleticism and poise...

954
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,468
...of each lovely woman.

955
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,555
The last time I was naked in public,
I came out of a uterus.

956
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,975
I don't have breasts, my thighs...
I should wear a muumuu.

957
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,436
I have avoided this experience
all my life.

958
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,439
And here it is.
You must achieve a Zen-like state.

959
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,234
Listen to your breathing,
feel your heart...

960
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,319
...think of the Dalai Lama.

961
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,590
Texas!

962
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,555
Rhode Island!

963
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,103
New Jersey!

964
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,867

California!

01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,632
I would have to say,
world peace.

968
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,427
Definitely, world peace.

969
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,430
That's easy. World peace.

970
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:54,806
World peace.

971
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:59,895
What is the one most important thing
our society needs?

972
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:05,317
That would be harsher punishment
for parole violators, Stan.

973
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,659
And, world peace.

974
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,416
Thank you, Gracie Lou.

975
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,251

01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,509
That was charming. Are you drunk?

978
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:36,014
Glad you enjoyed it. Now excuse me,
I have to go unscrew my smile.

979
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,058
We got a lead.

980

- The blood test?
- Photos.

981
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,355
Cheryl Frasier, with members
of a radical animal rights group...

982
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:46,024
- ... involved in bombings.
VIC: It's always the quiet ones.

983
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,319
She fits the profile:
loner, introverted.

984
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,154
That Cheryl?

That's a tough one.

987
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,875
I'd have to say April 25th...

988
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:07,504
...because it's not too hot,
not too cold.

989

All you need is a light jacket.

990
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,719
Now, there is a hardened criminal.

991
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,016
Maybe she's an accomplice.
Maybe she's his inside connection.

992
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,394
That's what you gotta find out.

993
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,603
How?

994
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,231
Buddy up to her, you know, girl talk.

995
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,650
- Girl talk?
- Yes, girl talk.

996
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,903
Sorry, I'm totally drawing a blank.

997
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:36,741
Leg waxing, fake orgasms,
the inability of men to commit.

998
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,368
Why don't you talk to her?

999
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,540
Imagine she's me and you want to know,
but I don't want to talk about it.

1000
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,125
What would you do?

1001
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,002
You want me to beat her?

01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:48,753
Why don't you talk to her?

1003
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,256
Okay, forget about it. I will go.

Hey, Rhode Island, how you doing?

01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,033
How can you ask that?
You heard my interview.

I was like a female Rain Man.

1012
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,289
Oh, no, it def-def-definitely
wasn't Rain Man.

1013
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,041
Definitely not Rain Man.

We can't have pizza and beer!

you're talking about?

01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,554
It's light beer and
she's gonna throw it up anyway.

go back on your bicycles...

...and I'll sit here with my
very large, cheesy pizza.

Oh, look at all that cheese.

Mmm, mm, mm.

At least scrape off the toppings.

Second step, flaming batons...

We're gonna get a drink.

Don't worry, we all sucked.

01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,834
...who takes me to a romantic dinner.

1046
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:36,254
Then we walk along the beach barefoot,
discussing books...

1047
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:39,382
...and music and movies!

1048
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,800
Aw.

1049
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,385
No wonder you're still a virgin.

1050
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,932
Time to paint. Come on.

1051
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,726
No, my contacts.

[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]

1053
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,229
- We'll stay here.
- I want more pizza.

1054
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,607
We're gonna have more pizza and beer.

1055
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,527
Have fun!

1056
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:03,072
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah, it's fun.

1057
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,325
It's so fun it should be illegal.

1058
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,453
Speaking of illegal,
have you ever, like...

1059
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,079
...committed a crime?

1060
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:12,540
Yes!

1061
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,293
Yes, I did.

1062
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,713
Go on.

1063
01:10:20,132 --> 01:10:23,635
One time I stole red underwear
from the department store.

1064
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,637
My mother wouldn't buy them!

1065
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,640
She said they were Satan's panties.

1066
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,478
- So is that it?
- Yeah.

1067
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,981
Oh, there was
this one thing in college...

1068
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,150
...with my lit professor.

1069
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:44,280
One day I came to his office. He said
he wanted to discuss a paper I wrote.

1070
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,742
He wanted to discuss a paper, right?

1071
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,662
Hey, can I get another
one of these tubie things?

1072
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,872
Yeah, can we get another tubie?

1073
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:56,084
Anyway, he attacked me.

1074
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,172
Cheryl, did you report him?

1075
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,467
No, I never told anyone before this.

1076
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,011
I know that happens all the time.

1077
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,514
No, it doesn't! Cheryl, it doesn't.

1078
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,642
There are so many maneuvers
that I could show you.

1079
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,018
Really?

1080
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,437
Yeah! Come on, get up.

1081
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,692
I want you to firmly plant your feet.

1082
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,527
I'm gonna move the chair.

1083
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,612
Now if someone comes at you...

1084
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:34,038
She's completely trashed.

1085
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,667
We should get her back
before Miss Morningside finds out.

1086
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,712
Kathy's got a boot up her ass
about something.

1087
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,840
I don't think she ever
got over those rumors.

1088
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:45,216
Come again?

1089
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,385
Her pageant years
she was a runner-up.

1090
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,513
But then the winner mysteriously
got food poisoning.

1091
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:51,931
Bizarro!

1092
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,560
No, Stan told me she got a letter
a few weeks back from the network...

1093
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,229
...and they're firing her too!

1094
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:01,566
She threw a chair out the window!

1095
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,736
We gotta go. Come on.

1096
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,572
I got 20 people here
waiting for confirmation.

1097
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,663
Don't tell me I don't understand.

1098
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:17,957
I hate when I don't see
a wet paint sign.

1099
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,334
Stop it. Listen.

1100
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,962
- Can't hear you, took out my earpiece.
- I have a lead and it's not Cheryl.

1101
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,590
Forget it. They bagged the Citizen.

1102
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,467
What? Where?

1103
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,719
It's confirmed.

1104
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,096
He was holing up in a shack in Nevada.

1105
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:35,058
Place had enough C4
to make a new Grand Canyon.

1106
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,101
Let's pack up and get out of here.

1107
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,439
Sir, I need to talk to you.
One second of your time.

1108
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,608
- Hart.
- Hear me out a second.

1109
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,071
I feel the situation bears further
scrutiny and our continued presence.

1110
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,532
Do you have paint in your ears?
We caught the guy!

1111
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,744
I respect what you're saying.
I'd say the same to me...

1112
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,871
...but what if we were wrong?

1113
01:12:57,414 --> 01:13:00,792
What if the Citizen didn't send it?
What if it was a copycat?

1114
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,087
The letter didn't follow
the normal pattern.

1115
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,464
The linguistic scheme
was uncharacteristic...

1116
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,008
...and the DNA said it was a woman!

1117
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:12,387
Maybe he got his girlfriend
to lick the envelope.

1118
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,889
I think we have reason
to monitor Morningside.

1119
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,476
Why don't you jump on her
dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake?

1120
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,437
You're the reason I had
to drag myself down here...

1121
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,815
...and I don't want to hear anymore!

1122
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,776
You're absolutely right, sir.
Not another damn word.

1123
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,069
Thank you.

1124
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,656
But she's getting fired this year,
which she didn't tell us.

1125
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,909
You're already in enough
trouble with the review board.

1126
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,746
Yeah, but when she was in the pageant,
the only reason she won was...

1127
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:42,667
...because the winner got
food poisoning. How bizarro is that?

1128
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,127
- "Bizarro"?
- Oh! Oh!

1129
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:48,131
She threatened me. According to Mary
Jo, she has a history of violence.

1130
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,549
Who is Mary Jo?

1131
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:52,343
Are you getting your information
from a pajama party?

1132
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,928
Would you shut up?

1133
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,347
You're shutting up enough
for both of us.

1134
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:57,598
- Matthews.
- Yes, sir?

1135
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:59,934
Is there any reason
to suspect Morningside?

1136
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:07,942
No, sir.

1137
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,030
There.

1138
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,451
I request permission to stay
with a small contingent.

1139
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:20,204
- Denied.
- Then I request permission to stay alone.

1140
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:24,876
You know what, I don't care
what you do. You want to stay, stay!

1141
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:28,379
But as a private citizen.
Turn in your badge and your gun.

1142
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,883
Everybody, I suggest we start packing.

1143
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,721
What?

1144
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,098
Don't look at me like I betrayed you.

1145
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,309
Betrayal implies action.
You stood there.

1146
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:43,019
You got nothing to go on.

1147
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,396
I know everyone thinks I'm a screwup.

1148
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:49,108
But I feel like I'm in the right
place at the right time.

1149
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,403
I have to protect those girls.
It is my job.

1150
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,905
Part of it is following orders.

1151
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:58,034
The other part is using your brain.
Throw out the rule book...

1152
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:01,245
I like the book. I like knowing
what I can and cannot do.

1153
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,623
You're not the only one who lives
for the job.

1154
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,834
I want to keep mine
for the next 20 or 30 years.

1155
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,670
Jesus, Hart.

1156
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,130
Give it a rest.

1157
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,132
Sure, give it a rest.

1158
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,385
What are you doing?

1159
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,430
Don't do it.

1161
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,933

1162
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,103
Thank you so much.

1163
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,606
I can't believe it!

1164
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,486
Hi, Mom.

1165
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,072
Don't do that!

1166
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:22,577
That slow, creepy thing in the shadows.
Your father used to do that.

1167
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:23,828
Mom.

1168
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:27,748
This isn't gonna work.

1169
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,002
Honey, of course it's going to work.

1170
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:34,255
The feds caught the Citizen.
We have no one to pin it on!

1171
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,007
Okay, that was bad luck.

1172
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:40,428
But what about all these other letters
from terrorist groups threatening us?

1173
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:42,221
"Women's Liberation Front. "

1174
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:45,850
"Islamic Jihad. " They're not so nuts
about the swimsuit competition.

1175
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,477
Any one of these
could have planted a bomb.

1176
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:50,354
When did we get those?

1177
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,107
I just finished writing them.

1178
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,359
Just like the Citizen letter.

1179
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,737
You're a genius.

1180
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,489
No, Frank. I'm just pissed off.

1181
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,992
Nobody fires me and gets away with it.

01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,369
They want a newer, hotter show...

1183
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,704
...they're gonna get it.

1184
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,873
Mom, you're a little scary.

1185
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:10,708
And you're a little bit sloppy.

1186
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,794
Tuck your shirt.
I don't want to tell you again.

1187
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,047
Let's go home, honey.

Mom?

1189
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,217
Oops.

1190
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:33,856
What's up?

1191
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,489
- Need a hand, boss?
- I got it.

1192
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,873
Okay, Vic. Beautify me.

1193
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:55,044
Hair, makeup, shellac, whatever
it is you do. That shiny stuff...

1194
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:56,545
Where are you going?

1195
01:17:56,755 --> 01:18:01,050
Your Agent McDonald insists that I
depart, or I won't be compensated.

1196
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:04,178
No. After the top 10!
I am completely on my own.

1197
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,931
The FBl is gone, it's not fixed.
I need you!

1198
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,183
Not anymore. The cocoon is open.

1199
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,353
I've taken a woman
without a smidgen of estrogen...

1200
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:14,230
...and made her a lady.

1201
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:17,024
- Come on.
- I've never been prouder of myself.

1202
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:19,527
Or...

1203
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,447
...of any girl I have ever coached.

01:18:24,574 --> 01:18:26,283
You are truly unique.

1205
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:31,455
If I ever had a daughter,
I imagine that she would be...

1206
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,124
...something like you.

1207
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,128
Which is why I never reproduced.

1208
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:42,633
I have a really strong feeling
something will happen to these girls.

You need to stay for me. Please.

I can't.

1211
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,807
But I can leave you this.
I was saving it for tonight.

1212
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,601
It's your size, I believe.

01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:47,143
A theater major...

1387
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:51,314
...she helps run a drama program
for underprivileged children.

1388
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:53,400
New Jersey!

1389
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:58,280
Gracie Lou Freebush hopes
to become a pediatrician.

1390
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:00,782
Gracie, it's you. Go!

1391
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:05,328
KATHY: Her hobbies include
figure skating, water ballet...

1392
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,498
...and taking long,
luxurious bubble baths.

1393
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:12,335
You go, Gracie Lou.

1394
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:15,505
And our fifth finalist:

1395
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:17,674
Texas!

1396
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:21,011
Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major.

1397
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,514
In her spare time,
she works in a homeless shelter...

1398
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:26,308
...and eats Mexican food.

1399
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:31,730
Thank you, ladies.
You were magnificent.

1400
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,029
I want all the lesbians to know...

1401
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:41,531
...if I can make it to the top 10,
so can you!

1402
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:43,491
Big out to Brooklyn! Yo!

1403
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,535
Get her off of there!

1404
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,037
Go to Stan!

1405
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,789
Tina, I love you, baby!

1406
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:52,334
I love you, Karen!

1407
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:57,130
Whoo! Yeah!

1408
01:33:57,381 --> 01:34:02,010
And we'll be right back with our
final five lesbians. Interviews.

1409
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:05,347
Bumper. Commercial.
Can we say "lesbians"?

1410
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:07,140
You got a problem with that?

1411
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,895
In a way, America is like a big ship.

1412
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:15,398
When we work together
and respect each other...

1413
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,234
...that's when the ship
gets safely home.

1414
01:34:19,278 --> 01:34:20,904
Terrific answer.

1415
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:22,197
Damn it.

1416
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,409
New Jersey.

1417
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,704
As you may know,
there are many who consider...

1418
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:35,085
...the Miss United States pageant
to be outdated and antifeminist.

1419
01:34:35,419 --> 01:34:37,087
What would you say to them?

1420
01:34:37,421 --> 01:34:38,755
Oh, my God.

1421
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:42,092
I would have to say,
I used to be one of them.

1422
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:46,596
And then I came here...

1423
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,431
...and I realized that...

1424
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:53,186
...these women are smart,
terrific people...

1425
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:57,941
...who are just trying to make
a difference in the world.

1426
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,695
We've become really good friends.

1427
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:07,033
I know we all secretly hope the other
one will trip and fall on her face...

1428
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:10,704
Wait a minute!
I've already done that!

1429
01:35:15,626 --> 01:35:19,838
For me, this experience has been
one of the most rewarding...

1430
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,967
...and liberating experiences
of my life.

1431
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,555
My God.

1432
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,432
I did it.

1433
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:34,894
And if anyone...

1434
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,646
...anyone...

1435
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,357
...tries to hurt one
of my new friends...

1436
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,401
...I would take them out.

1437
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:45,488
I would make them suffer so much,
they'd wish they were never born.

1438
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:49,659
And if they ran,
I would hunt them down.

1439
01:35:54,373 --> 01:35:55,498
Thank you, Kathy.

1440
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:04,591
A brief, shining moment,
and then that mouth.

1441
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:08,344
Helps if you pull it out.

1442
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,681
Good luck, ladies.

1443
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:14,100
Where's the crown?
I wanted to rub it for luck.

1444
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:15,977
Frank took it to get it polished.

1445
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,980
I'll have it by the time
they announce the winner.

1446
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,691
My God! It's the crown!

1447
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:23,985
Yes, it is. You can taste it now...

1448
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,403
No, no, no!

1449
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:29,824
It goes Texas, Rhode Island
and New Jersey. Let's go.

1450
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:32,160
Not the...
This. In the...

1451
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:33,995
SCOTT:
Finale positions.

1452
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:39,209
Yes. Wear the crown. Be the crown.
You are the crown.

1453
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:49,719
And now, the moment
of truth and beauty.

1454
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,222
STAN:
The envelope, please.

1455
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:06,694
What?

1456
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,739
A lot of tension.

1457
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,825
The fourth runner-up is...

1458
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:13,576
...California!

1459
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:24,170
KATHY:
The third runner-up is...

1460
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:27,924
...Nebraska!

1461
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:38,768
- Am I in danger here?
- Wait here.

1462
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,271
STAN:
The second runner-up is Texas!

1463
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:57,537
Drop it!

1464
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,414
I mean it! Drop it!

1465
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:00,707
This is it.

1466
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:01,958
The moment.

1467
01:38:02,126 --> 01:38:06,129
One of these two ladies
will wear the crown.

1468
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,132
Listen to me!

1469
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,467
I'm gonna reach for my badge, slow.

1470
01:38:11,635 --> 01:38:13,511
You do, and you're dead.

1471
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:17,307
STAN:
The first runner-up...

1472
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:20,810
...who will have to take the winner's
place if, for any reason...

1473
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:23,021
...she cannot fulfill her duties is:

1474
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:26,774
New Jersey! Which means...

1475
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,318
...our new Miss United States is:

1476
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:29,611
Don't take the crown.

1477
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,487
Rhode Island's Cheryl Frasier!

1478
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:35,783
- Don't take the crown. Trust me.
- I can't hear you. What?

1479
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:41,789
STAN:
She reigns over all she sees

1480
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:44,667
She's beauty and she's grace

1481
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:49,547
She's queen of 50 states
She's elegance and taste

1482
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:52,467
She's Miss United States

1483
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:56,554
Hold your crown up high

1484
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:02,101
Go ahead, hold your crown up high

1485
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:06,314
Raise it to the sky

1486
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:09,651
Jersey's gone berserk!

1487
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:11,653
Get her off the stage!

1488
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,529
Get away! Get away!

1489
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:16,783
STAN:
Hold your crown up high

1490
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:21,371
Raise it to the sky

1491
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:26,334
Hold your crown up high

1492
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:34,384
She stands for all that's good

1493
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:37,887
She loves her neighborhood

1494
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:42,976
She's friends with everyone she meets

1495
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,146
She's beauty and she's grace

1496
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,524
She's queen of 50 states

1497
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:54,195
She's elegance and taste

1498
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:57,240
She's Miss United States

1499
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:59,534
Hold your crown up high

1500
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:00,743
Gracie!

1501
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:05,540
Hold your crown up high

1502
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:27,937
She's Miss United States.

1503
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:31,733
Okay.

1504
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,944
Good show, everybody.

1505
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:39,741
- I was right in the middle of my song!
- There she is!

1506
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:45,121
You got nothing on me.
This is ridiculous.

1507
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:48,916
Where you're going, they'd love
to meet a former beauty queen.

1508
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:51,294
When he says meet, he means M-E-A-T.

1509
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:55,298
Miss Hart, you don't understand.

1510
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:59,177
All I'm guilty of is trying to make
the world a more beautiful place.

1511
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:00,636
Look at yourself.

1512
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:03,973
When I met you, Dennis Rodman
looked better in a dress.

1513
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:06,559
But now you're a lady! I did that.

1514
01:41:06,769 --> 01:41:10,980
Vic did that, and a team of highly
specialized federal manicurists...

1515
01:41:11,190 --> 01:41:13,691
...and people who make you beautiful.

1516
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,276
Get in the car.

1517
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,403
You think you saved something.

1518
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:21,949
All you did was to destroy the dream
of young women all over the country.

1519
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,785
Their dream is to get blown up?

1520
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:25,995
You got a good shot
at that insanity plea.

1521
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,622
I earned it!

1522
01:41:27,831 --> 01:41:30,458
Years of bitching beauty
queens and what do I get?

1523
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:34,587
Fired! They steal my life,
they steal my beauty pageant.

1524
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:39,008
Hey! It is not a beauty pageant.
It is a scholarship program.

1525
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:40,718
Yeah, yeah.

1526
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:41,928
"Yes. "

1527
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:52,146
Enjoy running the Miss San Antonio
Women's Correctional Facility Pageant!

1528
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:58,736
- Get it? The Women's Correctional...
- Hey.

1529
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,531
That was good work.

1530
01:42:04,034 --> 01:42:05,243
Right back at you.

1531
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:10,748
So, how does it feel?

1532
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:13,334
Throwing the rule book
out of the window?

1533
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,294
Pretty good, actually.

1534
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:17,880
I was thinking...

1535
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:19,465
...when we get back...

1536
01:42:19,675 --> 01:42:23,052
...after we write up our reports
and you get all ugly again...

1537
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,555
...maybe we could have dinner?

1538
01:42:25,764 --> 01:42:28,224
What? You asking me out on a date?

1539
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:30,560
No. Just a casual dinner.

1540
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,729
If we happen to have sex afterwards,
so be it.

1541
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:40,236
You think I'm gorgeous.

1542
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:43,281
You want to date me...

1543
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,325
...love me and marry me.

1544
01:42:57,796 --> 01:42:59,714
ERIC:
A part of you is gonna miss this.

1545
01:42:59,923 --> 01:43:02,091
The heels.
They do something for my posture.

1546
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:04,510
I'm suddenly very aware
and proud of my breasts.

1547
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,096
- Funny, me too.
- Agent Matthews! Gracie!

1548
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:08,681
Thank God you're still here.

1549
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:10,433
There's been an emergency.

1550
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:14,103
Somebody found some
sort of incendiary device.

1551
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,105
Come on, quickly!

1552
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:17,732
Excuse me. FBl.

1553
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:21,944
CHERYL: She saved the pageant,
she saved our lives, and here she is!

1554
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:26,616
That's not gonna work for me.

1555
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:28,951
I can't go up there!

1556
01:43:29,244 --> 01:43:30,578
It was his idea, Gracie Lou.

1557
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,623
I'd never get you here unless
you could shoot someone.

1558
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,625
You'll get yours, Henry Higgins.

1559
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:37,376
Come on.

1560
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:38,961
Come on!

1561
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,928
Ladies and gentlemen,
agent Gracie Hart of the FBl!

1562
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,641
Not so fast!

1563
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:54,977
Because even though
you're a federal officer...

1564
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:58,981
...to us, you will always be
Gracie Lou Freebush.

1565
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:03,986
The nicest, sweetest,
coolest girl at the pageant...

1566
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,989
...and this year's Miss Congeniality!

1567
01:44:24,007 --> 01:44:25,174
I, uh...

1568
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,635
I don't know what to say.

1569
01:44:28,804 --> 01:44:30,763
Except for...

1570
01:44:31,181 --> 01:44:32,932
...I can't wear this at work.

1571
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:38,187
I never thought anything like
this would happen to me.

1572
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:42,400
I kind of hoped it wouldn't.
But now that it has...

1573
01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:44,402
...I just want to say that...

1574
01:44:44,611 --> 01:44:46,028
...I'm very...

1575
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,283
...very honored.

1576
01:44:51,785 --> 01:44:52,827
And...

1577
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:55,037
...moved.

1578
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:56,914
And...

1579
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,210
...truly touched.

1580
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:06,173
And...

1581
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:15,308
...I really do want world peace.
