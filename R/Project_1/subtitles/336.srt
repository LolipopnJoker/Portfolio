1
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,777
Madeleine?

2
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,531
You want to eat again?

3
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,577
You eat too much because you're depressed.

4
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,038
Madeleine!

5
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:21,957
Yes?

6
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,961
Madeleine!

7
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,671
Yes, Mama?

8
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,631
I'm thirsty, my angel.

9
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,133
I'm coming.

10
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,302
Do you want your medicine?

11
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,845
Yes, my darling.

12
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,437
Do you want to play a game?

13
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm waiting for Papa to come home.

14
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,362
What do you think Papa does?

15
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,323
He's a doctor.

16
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,284
He heals people.

17
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,331
Your papa, he kills people.

18
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,415
Non.

19
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,627
Is that who you love? Murderers?

20
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,575
Maman.

21
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,660
Maman.

22
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,578
Maman. Maman.

23
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,246
Leave me be. Go play.

24
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,666
Maman!

25
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,750
Leave me alone!

26
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,025
Maman!

27
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,684
Is Mr. White home?

28
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,562
No. He's gone.

29
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,023
My name is Lyutsifer Safin.

30
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,568
-Your husband killed my family.

31
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,820
I told you, he's gone.

32
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,741
I know. This will hurt him more.

33
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,944
You okay?

34
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,405
Yes.

35
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,700
Let's go.

36
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,424
How's the view?

37
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,552
It's growing on me.

38
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,932
Can you go faster?

39
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,102
We don't need to go faster.

40
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,480
We have all the time in the world.

41
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,680
- Buonasera, signore.
- Buonasera.

42
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,650
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.

43
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,528
- What?
- No one is coming.

44
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,573
- I wasn't looking over my shoulder.
- Yes, you were.

45
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,616
No. Are we going to
have a row about this?

46
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,119
What are they burning?

47
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,622
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.

48
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,417
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.

49
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,808
Je taime.

50
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,102
Je taime.

51
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,494
Where did you go to?

52
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,372
Today, by the water. Hmm?

53
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,540
Tell me.

54
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,378
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.

55
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,300
Is that why we're here?

56
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,470
- She's buried at the acropolis.
- I know where she's buried.

57
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,683
Can you forgive her? For us?

58
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,146
I left her behind a long time ago.

59
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,781
As long as we're looking over
our shoulder, the past is not dead.

60
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,498
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.

61
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,293
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?

62
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,628
Mm-hmm.

63
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,841
So, I do this, and then...

64
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,426
I'll tell you all my secrets.

65
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,347
Okay.

66
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,419
I'm going to go and do this,

67
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,588
and then I'm going to come back
for breakfast.

68
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,008
Thank you.

69
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,763
And then you're going to tell me
where we're going next.

70
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,267
Home.

71
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,455
Buongiorno.

72
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,007
I miss you.

73
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,624
Madeleine?

74
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,168
Madeleine?

75
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,158
Blofeld sends his regards.

76
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,911
You know...

77
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,372
Madeleine,
she is a daughter of Spectre.

78
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,752
She's a daughter of Spectre.

79
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,257
Your baggage is already down,
Mr. Bond.

80
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,092
As your wife requested.

81
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,433
You were right.

82
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,563
Letting go is hard.

83
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,690
James.

84
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,149
What happened?

85
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,319
What happened?

86
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,862
How did they know I was here?

87
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,157
- What are you talking about?
- Madeleine, how did they know I was here?

88
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,594
- I have no idea what you're...
- Spectre. How did they know?

89
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,037
What are you talking about?
James!

90
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,833
I didn't do anything.

91
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,044
-I didn't do anything.

92
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,260
We're leaving.

93
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,943
There is something
I need to tell you.

94
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,778
I bet there is.

95
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,660
James!

96
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,892
Pick it up. Pick it up!

97
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,989
If's Blofeld, my love.

98
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,700
Your father would be so proud of you.

99
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,495
Your sacrifice will be our glory.

100
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,829
- I don't understand.
- Bravo.

101
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:31,879
Hello?

102
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,839
- Let the sheep out, kid.
- Why?

103
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,591
Because otherwise I'll kill you.

104
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,222
James, why?
Why would I betray you?

105
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,016
We all have our secrets.

106
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,102
We just didn't get to yours yet.

107
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,218
James. James, listen to me.

108
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,821
I'd rather die
than you think I'm tr...

109
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,531
James!

110
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,367
James!

111
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,744
Do something. James!

112
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,873
Say something, James!

113
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,084
Please.

114
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,679
Okay.

115
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,320
Come on.

116
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,627
So...

117
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,172
this is it?

118
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,550
This is it.

119
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,269
How will I know that you're okay?

120
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,771
You won't.

121
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,441

- Proceed.

151
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,144
Please remember to back up
all data by 10:00 p.m. this evening

152
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,937
aue to planned server maintenance.

153
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,150
You okay?

154
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:17,196
You know the SL5, the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?

155
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,282
Have you seen it?
I-I put it in the bloody...

156
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,493
Valdo, you haven't seen
a tub of smallpox, have you?

157
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,625
This was a good soup,
now it is waste,

158
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,501
even if it is joke.

159
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,878
-Idiot.

160
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,672
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup

161
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,050
than in both of your brains combined.

162
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,969
Valdo, that is so unkind. It's so...

163
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,597
One day I will put Ebola
in your tea.

164
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,434
And then I will watch
as your faces sweat blood,

165
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,311
-and I will be laughing.

166
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,396
- Nice. Keep your hair on.
- Wow.

167
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,149
He's got a terrifying imagination,
hasn't he?

168
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,275
Dr. Obruchev.

169
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,277
They are coming.

170
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,362
Who?

171
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,613
Spectre.

172
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,452
Safin.

173
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,079
Do not try to stop them.

174
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,206
This is what
we've been waiting for.

175
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:17,256
They will ask you to enter Bio Security
Level-4 fridge and remove the weapon.

176
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,424
No one must see what you are doing.

177
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,470
They will not kill you.
They think they need you.

178
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,639
They will not kill me?

179
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,018
Transferring the files
as we speak.

180
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,273
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?

181
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,941
-Swallow it. Goodbye.

182
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,025
Swallow the...

183
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:41,738
Yes, I like animals!

184
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,823
Bye-bye.

185
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,327
For goodness' sake!

186
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,046
Danger. Illegal access detected.

187
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,757
Secure all biohazardous materials
immediately.

188
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,679
- Move! Follow!

189
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,433
No! No!

190
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,895
Caution. Unauthorized
personnel located in this sector.

191
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,615
Please, we're scientists.
We're unarmed.

192
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,285
-We're unarmed. What do you want?

193
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,621
Valdo Obruchev.

194
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,540
Uh-huh. Hello.

195
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,335
Open the Bio Security Level-4 fridge.

196
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,921
- And...
- Give me the weapon.

197
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:41,715
What weapon?

198
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,258
We have...

199
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,719
Heracles.

200
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,513
- It requires double authentication.
- Which one?

201
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,392
Him.

202
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,978
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.

203
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,356
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.

204
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,565
- No!

205
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,905
Warning, facility lockdown in progress.

206
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,492
All exits are now sealed.

207
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,079
Warning, facility lockdown in progress.

208
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,165
All exits are now sealed.

209
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,585
Oh, what is...

210
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,879
-It's a safety belt? This?

211
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,592
Wow.

212
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,818
I-l cannot.

213
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,654
There is no elevator!

214
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,703
Magnets.

215
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,069
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual...

216
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,893
-I've seen it.

217
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,859
Oh, Jesus Christ.

218
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,658
Sir, what's the Heracles project?

219
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,453
This lab isn't on the books.

220
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,704
No, it's not.

221
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,417
- There were casualties.
- It was a gas leak.

222
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,336
Shall I alert the PM?

223
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,171
It was a gas leak. I'll handle it.

224
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,339
Moneypenny.

225
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,134
Where's 0077?

226
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,242
Well, isn't this a surprise, Felix?

227
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,326
James.

228
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,245
Who's the blond?

229
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:08,375
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

230
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,629
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

231
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,172
- Babylon.
- Police boy.

232
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,382
I need a favor, brother.

233
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,342
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

234
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,387
I wouldn't ask if you were still
in Her Majesty's Service.

235
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,638
And what does that mean?

236
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,309
Our elected leaders aren't playing nice
in the sandbox.

237
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,561
James.

238
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,650
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

239
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,153
Quiet? Yeah.

240
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,908
I was hoping
you could pick up a package.

241
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,991
- Five.
- Four.

242
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,705
Where's the package?

243
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,623
Short trip. Cuba.

244
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,417
You love it there.

245
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,335
Oh, I love it there?

246
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,628
Valdo Obruchev.

247
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,588
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

248
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,298
Never heard of him.

249
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,842
- Two.
- Three.

250
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,634
Ah.

251
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,886
It's a good life.

252
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,474
You never heard of him? Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

253
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,103
Obruchev was kidnapped three days ago
from a secret MI6 lab in London.

254
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,565
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

255
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,692
in Santiago de Cuba.

256
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,610
He's leaving out the best part.

257
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,112
Spectre.

258
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,323
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

259
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,492
Coincidence?

260
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,497
Come on. It'll be like old times.

261
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:31,875
- Three.
- Two.

262
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,964
You're really
the only guy for the job.

263
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,383
You're the guy.

264
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,135
It's my round.

265
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,686
Hi.

266
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,859
- Scotch.
- Yeah, man.

267
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,531
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

268
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,326
Political appointee.
Not my choice.

269
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,870
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

270
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,206
He smiles too much.

271
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,583
Help us get this
into the right hands.

272
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,145
- What, and you're the right hands?
- I'm not just a pretty face.

273
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,005
I stopped trusting pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.

274
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,216
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

275
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,051
- Bad judgment.
- Yeah.

276
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,889
Harder to tell the good from bad,
villains from heroes these days.

277
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,308
I need you, James.

278
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,871
You're the only one I trust with this.
I'm not screwing around.

279
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,855
I wanna get back to my family,
tell them I saved the world again.

280
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,191
Don't you?

281
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,946
Nice to see you again, Felix.

282
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,908
- At least take my number.
- I've got your number.

283
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,894
In trouble?

284
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,523
Constantly.

285
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,107
Need a ride?

286
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,069
Sure. Why not?

287
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,782
Hold on.

288
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,871
- What's your name?
- Nomi.

289
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,415
- Yours?
- James. Call me James.

290
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,876
- What do you do, Nomi?
- I'm a diver.

291
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,502
What do you dive for?

292
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,171
-I have a thing for old wrecks.

293
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,895
Well, then you've come
to the right place.

294
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,849
After you.

295
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:05,695
Hmm.

296
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,989
Nice house.

297
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,198
Thank you.

298
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,284
Is that the bedroom?

299
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:16,956
Yes, itis.

300
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,102
Well, that's not the first thing
I thought you'd take off, but...

301
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,187
Yeah.

302
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:43,942
You seem like a man
who's gagging for some action, Mr. Bond.

303
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,945
Shall we cut to the chase?

304
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,323
- I'm here as a professional courtesy.
- Well, you're not very courteous, are you?

305
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,075
You've broken my car...

306
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,577
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

307
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,413
Double-07?

308
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:58,915
- Two years.
- Very young.

309
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,584
- High achiever.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

310
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,379
The world's moved on since you retired,
Commander Bond.

311
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,714
- Perhaps you didn't notice.
- No, can't say I had.

312
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,802
And in my humble opinion,
the world doesn't change very much.

313
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:12,887
You would say that.

314
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,516
Look, this all seems like heaven,
this little bubble or whatever.

315
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,645
But it's so obvious
you're a man who only has time to Kill,

316
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,980
nothing to live for.

317
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,816
So, Valdo Obruchev is off-limits.

318
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:28,236
You get in my way,
I will put a bullet in your knee.

319
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,364
The one that works.

320
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,244
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

321
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:43,001
MI6, CIA chasing after the same man,
not communicating with each other,

322
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,545
that's not good.

323
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,588
- Mmm.
- You know what?

324
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,634
Tell M hello, but...
I don't work for him anymore.

325
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,928
Tell him yourself.

326
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,725
By the way,

327
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,852
I'm not just any old double-0.

328
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,396
I'm 007.

329
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,859
You probably thought
they'd retire it.

330
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,071
It's just a number.

331
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:14,240
Yeah.

332
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,118
See you in Cuba?

333
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,039
How's it going, Q7?

334
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,709
Several large files seem to have been
wiped from Obruchev's hard drive.

335
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,503
He was working on
some pretty advanced algorithm...

336
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,172
Can you retrieve the files?

337
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,298
-Trying.

338
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,443
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

339
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,267
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

340
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,679
-Thank you, Q. That's all.

341
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,765
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

342
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,975
007. Tell them something.
Anything.

343
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,687
007.

344
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,939
M, darling. Couple of things.

345
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,235
- Bond.
- I met your new 007.

346
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,446
She's a disarming young woman.

347
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,282
So, Obruchev.

348
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,242
You kept him on the payroll, didn't you?

349
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,995
Stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.

350
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,372
It does. It's Spectre.

351
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,291
Mallory...

352
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,418
what have you done?

353
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,972
- Double-0 trouble?
- The CIA have the advantage.

354
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:21,182
Get me Blofeld.

355
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,059
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

356
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,852
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

357
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:35,071
They stay straight in the middle.
And then they bring him up.

358
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,865
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

359
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,617
- It's crowning day.
- Good.

360
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,619
What is it?

361
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,704
It's nothing.

362
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,832
It's clean. It's clean as can be.

363
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,876
Everyone just wants a party.
Yeah, I want them both fo hear me.

364
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,213
Itll be a surprise.

365
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,031
Felix...

366
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,158
I'm in.

367
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,993
He's in.

368
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,537
There's a young lady in Santiago
I want you to meet.

369
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,712
Paloma?

370
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,925
- You're late.
- L...

371
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,051
Vamos.

372
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,471
Um, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

373
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,640
Huh? What hat?

374
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,061
I forget things
when I get nervous.

375
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,189
This is the biggest job
I've ever had. Come.

376
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,328
This your room?

377
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,455
It's a wine cellar.

378
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,000
Okay, come here.

379
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:00,549
Don't you think we ought to get to know
each other just a little bit before we...

380
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,842
Oh!

381
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,261
No, no, no, no.

382
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,721
Um, no, I'm sorry.

383
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,058
- All right.
- You do it.

384
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,142
Thank you.

385
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,273
Do you mind?

386
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,612
This is going to go brilliantly.

387
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,032
I know.
I've done three weeks' training.

388
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,682
- ¢ Que?
- Let's get a drink.

389
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,934
Good idea.

390
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,358
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

391
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,068
SJ, senor.

392
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,706
-So I can hear you.

393
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,048
What shall we drink to?

394
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,215
Felix?

395
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,885
To Felix.

396
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,971
Remind me to get him a cigar.

397
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,483
¢ Vamos?

398
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,859
- Sure.
- Okay.

399
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,828
Will this sample
be enough for you?

400
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,206
If he has used it, yes.

401
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,957
It is now progressing.

402
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,883
Oops. Sorry.

403
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,429
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

404
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,263
Forgive me.

405
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,058
How much longer?

406
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,939
Aha!

407
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,193
To happy new future for Spectre.

408
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,989
Now it is ready.

409
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:01,897
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

410
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,533
What is this?
Spectre bunga bunga?

411
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,595
You ever been to a party like this?

412
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,080
How do you think I got this job?

413
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,540
Don't get distracted, now.

414
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,917
Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.

415
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,919
I'm seeing a lot of Spectre agents.

416
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,087
Yes.

417
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,506
And it looks like all of them.

418
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:32,887
Wow.

419
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,107
Friend of yours?

420
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,442
Cyclops.

421
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,402
We ran into each other in Italy.

422
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,155
That was an eye-opening experience.

423
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,409
They're wearing earpieces.

424
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:56,952
Scanning.

425
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,462
It'll be all clear.
It'll be clean.

426
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,464
It's good. It's as good as can be.

427
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,341
- It's my party.
- Ah. Found it.

428
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,802
Celebrate me, my birthday,
my crowning day.

429
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,765
Who's the birthday boy?

430
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,726
Um, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

431
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,478
Is he here?

432
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,230
- No, he's...
- Make your way.

433
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,523
Follow the music.

434
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,107
He's in London in prison.

435
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,193
How do you know for sure?

436
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,862
Because I put him there.

437
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,281
Feel my warm embrace.

438
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,368
Experience a delicious surprise.

439
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,248
Let us shepherd humanity
with our new power.

440
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,501
I've spotted him,
our little Russian scientist.

441
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,503
Have you got him?

442
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,547
- I got him.
- Stay with him.

443
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,217
But I see you from my little eye,

444
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,761
and my little eye says hi.

445
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,180
Now, see, now...

446
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:02,893
we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.

447
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,772
Here's fo the end of our pariah.

448
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,734
Oh, my burden, my brother...

449
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,988
James Bond.

450
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,283
-Goodbye, James.

451
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,871
You're popular tonight.

452
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:26,000
You can't run. It's too late.

453
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,965
It's already crawling under your skin.

454
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,510
Don't be alarmed. It's harmless fo us.

455
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:39,096
-Just to him. So delicious.

456
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,188
Sir!

457
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,943
It is working.

458
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,154
It is working. Only Spectre are dying.

459
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,082
Hello.

460
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,129
Are you for my esco...

461
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,255
Huh?

462
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,882
No?

463
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,972
Go!

464
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,611
- Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!

465
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,945
- What was that?
- Get him!

466
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,873
Time to go. Let's go!

467
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,345
- It's clear.

468
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,429
-Huh?

469
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:06,766
May I cut in?

470
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,981
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.

471
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,525
- Cover the exits!

472
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,652
-Paloma.

473
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,199
Don't let them get away!

474
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,789
Have you got them?

475
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,872
Nearly.

476
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,084
No!

477
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,060
Down!

478
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,690
Get them!
Don't let them get away!

479
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,024
Paloma, I know you're busy,

480
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,193
but the curtain's about to come down
on this one.

481
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,154
I can get a car.
Where do you need it?

482
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,237
I'll be right there.

483
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,578
Stay down!

484
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,584
Move!

485
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,448
-Huh?

486
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Come on!

487
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,509
Three weeks' training, really?

488
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:04,593
More or less.

489
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,956
We're still gonna need that car.

490
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,513
- Salud.
- Salud.

491
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,707
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm taking you back to Mother, darling.

492
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,709
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.

493
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,298
Oh. There you are.

494
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,975
Oh! No!

495
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,650
-Stay there! You okay?

496
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,110
I'm great.

497
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,412
I'm gonna borrow
your plane. Sorry.

498
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,351
It's a shortcut.

499
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,743
This is my stop. Goodbye.

500
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,372
- You were excellent.
- You too.

501
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,874
Next time, stay longer.

502
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,083
- I will.
- Hey.

503
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,377
- A cigar for Felix.
- Thank you. Come on.

504
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,462
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

505
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,262
Come on, let's go.

506
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,641
No, no, no, sir.
I am not getting on that.

507
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,436
Well, that's a shame
because we don't have a choice.

508
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,104
Let's go. Come on.

509
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,108
Okay, okay,
what have we got here?

510
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:45,087
Sir, I just saved your life, okay?
Please remember that.

511
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,799
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

512
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,300
Where are you taking me?

513
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,678
Somewhere safe.

514
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,081
At least make it look hard.

515
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,542
Thanks, Felix.
You walked me into a trap. Get in.

516
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,169
What trap?

517
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,005
Spectre's dead. Sit.

518
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,589
- Who's dead?
- All of them.

519
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:30,674
Good.

520
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,804
What is this?
Explain it to me.

521
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,724
I don't have the words
to describe to someone like you.

522
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:39,975
Try one.

523
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,895
It's... perfect.

524
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,480
A perfect what?

525
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,898
What? Assassin.

526
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,502
- Thank you, Bond. Your mission's done.
- Why didn't it kill me?

527
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,087
You don't have to
answer those questions.

528
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,131
- Why Spectre?
- Bond, please stop asking these questions.

529
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,156
Quiet!

530
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,282
Speak up.

531
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:59,244
Because you were never
the intended target.

532
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,079
He was a target? Why?

533
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,457
I changed the DNA
like we decided.

534
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,584
Now the plan is complete
and I'm confused.

535
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who is "we"?

536
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,855
- Did M make you build this?
- He is not allowed to do this.

537
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,079
He is out of line here, Felix.

538
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:12,007
- Did M order you to kill Spectre?
- Ash.

539
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,759
- Don't answer that!
- Is M behind this?

540
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,093
- He is out of line!
- Felix!

541
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,887
Ash, shut your mouth!

542
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,847
M. M helped me build it.

543
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,974
But please,
he does not have the vision

544
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,938
- for how to use it.
- Well, who does? Who does?

545
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,980
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

546
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:35,738
Whoa!

547
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:25,705
I'm with Safin. You understand?

548
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,041
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

549
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,710
I know who you are.

550
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,381
I don't know about you...

551
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,968
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

552
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,973
We need to have a conversation
about the company you keep.

553
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,182
I'm with you.

554
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,019
That's a lot of blood.

555
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,109
So, where are we going?

556
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:56,987
Get in the plane, Doctor.

557
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,406
This might be my last mission.
What do you think?

558
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,659
I think you're just looking
for an excuse not to help me.

559
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,202
-There you go.

560
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:06,246
Paloma, she gave me
a cigar for you to smoke,

561
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,956
and you are gonna smoke it.

562
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,584
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

563
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,545
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

564
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,672
I'm gonna find us a way out.

565
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,133
I'll be over here.

566
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,468
You know, Felix,
we really need to stop meeting...

567
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,935
- Whoa.
- Shit.

568
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,855
I was such a big fan of his.

569
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,821
Felix!

570
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,336
This doesn't look good.

571
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,924
Come on, Felix.
We've been in worse than this. Let's go.

572
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:03,178
It's like back when I was a kid
on that shrimp boat.

573
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,013
You're from Milwaukee.

574
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,432
Am 1? I thought I made that up.

575
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,356
He got me.

576
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:18,568
Just let me go.
Let me go.

577
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,868
-You got this?

578
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,373
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

579
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,126
Make it worth it.

580
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:38,880
James...

581
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,509
it's a good life, isn't it?

582
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,553
The best.

583
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,518
Felix.

584
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,313
Felix.

585
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,439
Felix.

586
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,756
- Name?
- Bond.

587
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,011
James Bond.

588
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,184
How's retirement?

589
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,268
Quiet.

590
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:44,441
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

591
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,609
I thought you two
would get along.

592
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,403
Report, 007.

593
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,529
Thank you.

594
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,198
00... 7.

595
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,201
That must bother you.

596
01:05:58,997 --> 01:05:59,873
Where is he?

597
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,749
He left me... for somebody else.

598
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:02,917
It's...

599
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,919
- So, you lost him?
- You can go in.

600
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,129
- Thank you.
- Thank y...

601
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,756
Alone, I'm afraid.

602
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:11,551
Oh. Does that bother you?

603
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,643
- I get why you shot him.
- Yeah, well,

604
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,396
everyone tries at least once.

605
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:30,612
Has this desk got bigger?

606
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,324
Or have you got smaller?

607
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,829
I can't pretend there weren't
some sorry faces when you left us, Bond,

608
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,707
but you fell so far off the grid

609
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,459
that we thought you must be dead.

610
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:50,632
Now, learning that you...
were, in fact, alive and well and...

611
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,678
working for the CIA, well...

612
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,266
Well, that really was a blow.

613
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,311
Well, they just asked so nicely.

614
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:07,941
It's a shame
that you haven't lost your touch.

615
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,735
We wouldn't be in this mess.

616
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,655
This is your mess.

617
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,158
Blofeld tried to kill me in Cuba,

618
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,410
but someone hijacked his plan.

619
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:25,041
And whoever stole your weapon
used it to wipe out Spectre instead.

620
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:27,710
Now your weapon is on the run

621
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,837
and nobody seems to know who has it.

622
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,799
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

623
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,259
We're looking into it.

624
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:36,261
I can identify the man
that took Obruchev.

625
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,054
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

626
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:40,306
Blofeld.

627
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,434
- Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.
- Yes.

628
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:47,438
He ran a Spectre meeting in Cuba
from Belmarsh.

629
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,856
- How?
- No.

630
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,734
How? No one has access.
No one.

631
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:55,446
Why didn't you shut it down?

632
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,448
Why didn't you shut Heracles down?

633
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,410
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

634
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,369
And to Felix Leiter?

635
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,080
I certainly don't answer
to Felix Leiter.

636
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,124
Perhaps because he's dead.

637
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,090
I'm sorry.

638
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,885
I had a lot of respect for Leiter.

639
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:26,477
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

640
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:27,812
Get me into Belmarsh.

641
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:31,733
No. Blofeld's the only member of Spectre
still breathing. I can't risk that.

642
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,236
Oh, but you will risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

643
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,905
with a corrupt scientist for ten years?

644
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,367
There was nothing to suggest
that Obruchev was working for anyone else.

645
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,287
- I had him down.
- My God, you're thirsty at the moment.

646
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,833
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

647
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:52,629
You have no right to make insinuations
about my judgment.

648
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:56,299
If you've nothing left to give,
you are irrelevant.

649
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,470
You've done your bit
and we thank you for your service, again.

650
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,554
Goodbye.

651
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,558
Moneypenny, send in 007.

652
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:06,851
You can go, Bond.

653
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,777
It's definitely the same desk.

654
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,866
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

655
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,164
Go to Belmarsh.

656
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:32,835
I want everything that Blofeld listens to,
looks at and touches scanned.

657
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,046
Scan every corner of that cell.

658
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:39,592
Scan the whole prison.
In fact, scan the whole damn man.

659
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,470
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

660
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,559
James, uh...

661
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,979
what are you doing for dinner?

662
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:22,844
So, you're not dead?

663
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,220
Hello, Q. I've missed you.

664
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,306
Mmm! That smells great.

665
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,392
Were you expecting somebody?

666
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,228
Um... No. What... Excuse me.

667
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,858
Oh. This is the first time I've...

668
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,568
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

669
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,902
I can't take my focus off...

670
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,821
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

671
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:43,781
No, I need to lay the table.

672
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,037
You know,
they come with fur these days.

673
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:53,708
I want to be very clear
that I am not authorized to help you.

674
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,043
- And I have sworn...
- It's to do with Heracles.

675
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,798
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

676
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:04,886
No, but there's something going on, Q.
We need to find out what it is.

677
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,477
Well, it's never 9:00 to 5:00, is it?

678
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,730
Thank you.

679
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,861
- Um, Bond?
- Yes?

680
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,280
Do you know where this has been?

681
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,782
Everywhere, I should imagine.

682
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,201
Into the sandbox.

683
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,707
Oh. Thank you.

684
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,710
Um, it's a database.

685
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,922
Don't touch that, please.

686
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,256
What's the data?

687
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,634
It's DNA. Multiple individuals.

688
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,052
What was M working on?

689
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,346
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

690
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,972
- Oh, hello.
- What?

691
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,433
There's more. Hidden files.

692
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:54,602
I was asked to recover what I could

693
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,814
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

694
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,816
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

695
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,776
this is what was missing.

696
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,278
Yeah. A complete disk.

697
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:12,995
So, Obruchev is working for someone
who managed to kill all of Spectre?

698
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,372
Not all of them.

699
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,333
Blofeld.

700
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,001
Can you show me the other files?

701
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,837
Mm-hmm.

702
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,302
Wait, this can't just be Spectre.

703
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:30,763
Oh, my God.

704
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,266
There are thousands.

705
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:35,810
Who are they?

706
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,648
They're in categories.
I'm gonna need more time to organize...

707
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,316
There have been, uh, breaches

708
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,486
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

709
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,656
- We've been tracking them.
- Ours?

710
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,868
I can't imagine they're leaving us out,
whoever they are.

711
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:55,580
Well, Blofeld will know who they are.
Q, you need to get me into Belmarsh.

712
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,918
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

713
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,838
Who? M says no one has access.

714
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,923
- Really?
- Did he?

715
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,550
What's that?

716
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,430
Can I just have one nice evening, please,
before the world explodes?

717
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,724
Who has access? Who?

718
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,399
- Morning.
- Morning.

719
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,860
New patient. He's weird.

720
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,195
You can't say that.

721
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,161
I'm sorry I'm late.

722
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,582
I wasn't expecting a new patient.

723
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,340
Sorry if I surprised you.

724
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,301
No. I like surprises.

725
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:56,724
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

726
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:59,393
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

727
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,067
They are usually more of a danger
to themselves.

728
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,572
Foxgloves.

729
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:13,407
Beautiful.

730
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,494
- Did you choose them?
- Yes.

731
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,245
I found them friendly.

732
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:22,541
You know if you eat them,
they can cause your heart to just...

733
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:26,879
stop.

734
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,590
Then I'll make sure not to.

735
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,432
Do you know a lot about flowers?

736
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:42,269
My father had a garden.
He taught me.

737
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:45,064
He died when I was young,
but my interest...

738
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:47,733
remained.

739
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,736
It's difficult to lose a parent.

740
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,281
Especially at a young age.

741
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,200
Yes,

742
01:14:56,283 --> 01:15:00,204
death has a particular effect
on children...

743
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,580
doesn't it?

744
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,294
What effect did it have on you?

745
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:12,466
Profound.
But I saved a life once.

746
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,678
I think that had
more of an effect.

747
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:18,222
Why is that?

748
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,516
Saving someone's life

749
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,728
connects you to them forever,

750
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,438
the same as taking it.

751
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,065
They belong to you.

752
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,322
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

753
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:37,867
so I brought a memory box.

754
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,496
I thought it might interest you.

755
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,043
Sometimes objects can be
more evocative than memories.

756
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:02,099
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

757
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,269
They needed me.

758
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,900
It is a shock to see them
SO many years later.

759
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:14,570
They still need me.

760
01:16:15,613 --> 01:16:17,698
I am rather taken by them.

761
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:18,783
What do you want?

762
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,701
Just a favor.

763
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,536
You owe me.

764
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,122
You murdered my mother.

765
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:28,626
And your father killed
my entire family.

766
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,588
Parents.

767
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,926
I need you to visit someone for me,
wearing this.

768
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:39,845
It's harmless to you.

769
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,936
You are the only one who can do it.

770
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,313
No.

771
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,774
Why would I do anything for you?

772
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,025
Because I...

773
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:57,863
am a man willing to kill
the person you love most.

774
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,950
I've already lost
everyone I've ever loved.

775
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,328
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

776
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,416
That is very sad to hear, Madeleine.

777
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,882
But it is not true...

778
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,638
is it?

779
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,565
Madeleine Swann, really?

780
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,526
Well, yes.
We took your information seriously,

781
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,570
but that was five years ago.

782
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:38,821
Nothing came up.

783
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,031
Well, she's very smart
and very good at hiding things.

784
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,199
She's a useful asset.

785
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,660
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

786
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:46,829
I had to exercise my judgment...

787
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,747
Your judgment is the problem.

788
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,334
That weapon was designed
to save lives

789
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,296
and to eradicate collateral damage
for our agents.

790
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,091
A clean, accurate shot every time.

791
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,802
But it had to be off the books.

792
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,681
There are enough holes
in our national security.

793
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,560
If the world knows what this can do...

794
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:10,769
- They'd kill for it.
- Mmm.

795
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:12,897
Look...

796
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:19,445
if it's an error, it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.

797
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,241
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

798
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:28,287
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

799
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,538
Of this.

800
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:34,084
But we used to be able to
get into a room with the enemy.

801
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,003
We could look him in the eye.

802
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,379
And now, the...

803
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,884
the enemy is just floating
in the ether.

804
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,386
We don't even know
what they're after.

805
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:46,597
Blofeld.

806
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,726
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

807
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:51,894
"We"?

808
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,522
Oh, for fuck's sake.

809
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,025
I see.

810
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,070
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

811
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,364
Well, it's hard to say.

812
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:07,243
I mean, I would imagine world leaders,
innocent civilians,

813
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,869
freedom, you know,
that sort of thing.

814
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,664
Oh, good, well, just the usual.

815
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,165
Just the usual.

816
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:21,423
Blofeld was communicating with his agents
in Cuba through a bionic eye...

817
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,884
which we've now retrieved.

818
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,511
You're welcome.

819
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,973
Spectre's destruction's
going to have huge consequences.

820
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,477
Whoever did this is going to be
very dangerous and very powerful.

821
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:38,524
We need all the information
that we can gather.

822
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:39,608
Sir.

823
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,152
Sir.

824
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:44,989
Bond.

825
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,366
So the rumors are true.

826
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,285
- You look well.
- Tanner.

827
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,204
Sir, there's been a development.

828
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:58,377
They were just dropping,
one right after the other.

829
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,713
It was disturbing, to say the least.

830
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,881
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

831
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:06,302
- Uh, Bond's in the office.
- What?

832
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:13,600
Oh, Bond.
My God, I haven't seen you in, uh...

833
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:14,768
How is your retirement?

834
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:17,271
Shut up, Q.
I know he's staying with you.

835
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,606
- And you're not in the clear either.
- What happened?

836
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,442
He's been reinstated as a double-0.

837
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,696
- Double-0 what?
- What have you got?

838
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:32,453
Q has studied the blood samples I gathered
from the victims of the funeral.

839
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,371
Just look at this.

840
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,582
- What are we looking at?

841
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:40,336
This is the funeral of one of
the dead Spectre agents from Cuba.

842
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:42,421
And here are
the members of their family

843
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,673
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

844
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:48,302
We found Heracles
in the blood samples of all of them.

845
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,181
Now, that's some good work, Nomi.

846
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:54,224
Thank you, sir.
Double-0 what?

847
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:57,853
- What are they?
- They're... They're nanobots.

848
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,397
Right.

849
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,691
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

850
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,610
by the slightest contact with your skin.

851
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,578
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

852
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:16,955
Heracles was...

853
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:22,461
It was designed to be
the most efficient weapon in our arsenal.

854
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:26,715
Passing through people harmlessly
before reaching its intended target.

855
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,093
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

856
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,178
so they can kill anyone
related to the target.

857
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,096
Anyone?

858
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,973
Well, since it's DNA-based,
with further modifications, yes.

859
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:38,560
Families, certain genetic traits.

860
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,605
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

861
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:44,400
that could target a range
from individuals

862
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:46,026
to whole ethnicities.

863
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:50,114
- You infect enough people...
- And the people become the weapon.

864
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:53,617
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

865
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,161
It was in...

866
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,624
I need to call the prime minister.

867
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,128
Tanner, quarantine the families
from the funeral.

868
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,212
Yes, sir.

869
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:09,049
And, Q, hack into Blofeld's
bionic eye. See what you can find.

870
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,136
-You've got your wish.

871
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:15,097
Go to Blofeld
and see what you can get out of him.

872
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,182
And find that cockroach Obruchev.

873
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,059
Sir.

874
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,356
We don't have a trail.

875
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:28,485
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

876
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:30,279
Find him, you'll find Obruchev.

877
01:22:31,238 --> 01:22:33,699
Um... Good luck.

878
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,411
Thanks.

879
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:06,315
I'll be outside when you're done
with your important preparation.

880
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,068
I'll be just a moment.

881
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,321
It's fine.

882
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,675
Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.

883
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,600
Accessing received media stream.

884
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:43,769
I know you and she have a history,

885
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,772
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

886
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,690
She's been very compliant.

887
01:23:48,774 --> 01:23:51,818
If Bond does anything weird in there,
you'll be doing me a huge favor,

888
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:54,196
so don't make it
too easy for him, okay?

889
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,572
Okay.

890
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,908
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

891
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,411
I know you and he have a history,

892
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,455
but don't let him
get in your head.

893
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,019
If you feel yourself
losing control...

894
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:08,377
Oh, Tanner, relax.

895
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,962
I'm not gonna lose...

896
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,260
control.

897
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,892
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

898
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,983
Mr. Bond.

899
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:36,780
007.

900
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,746
Six-seven.
Special cell two now locked off.

901
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,962
Segregation unit secure.

902
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,256
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

903
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:56,008
Just get us a name.

904
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:07,561
Must be nice to catch up
with an old friend so regularly.

905
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:09,938
We're closer than ever.

906
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:15,068
That was awkward.
Does he have that effect on all women?

907
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:18,113
- Fifty-fifty. It's unpredictable.

908
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,535
Isolated in HSU.

909
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,629
You're shaking.

910
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,882
It's not an ideal situation.

911
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,455
Open the door.

912
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:10,415
Open the door.

913
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:13,085
Don't.

914
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,920
What is it?

915
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,465
James, you don't know what this is.

916
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,009
Don't make me do this.

917
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,386
Please.

918
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:24,096
Right. Open the doors.

919
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,472
- Open the door.
- Open it.

920
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:26,682
-What...

921
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,395
Where are you going?

922
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:33,980
Home.

923
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,694
- I'll get her.
- Wait.

924
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,947
- He won't talk without her.
- Just wait.

925
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,117
Special delivery.

926
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:02,718
James.

927
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,720
Hello, Blofeld.

928
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:09,975
Perhaps you can help me.

929
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,603
Cuba was quite the party.

930
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:16,106
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thank you.

931
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,608
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

932
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:22,446
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

933
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,032
with the world's most powerful people,
your friends, all in one room,

934
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:28,493
a noose around my neck,

935
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:31,830
and your hands on
the most valuable weapon in existence.

936
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:34,791
It's like a...

937
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:38,462
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

938
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:42,632
A celebration
of all that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

939
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,676
Yeah, James.

940
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,597
Yeah.

941
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,724
But then it all went wrong,

942
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:51,892
didn't it?

943
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:56,021
My sweet James,
what do you want?

944
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,231
Your enemies are closing in, Blofeld.

945
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:05,071
And the biggest twist here
is that if you tell me who they are,

946
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:06,573
I could save your life.

947
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,493
Mmm, my avenging angel.

948
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,370
My chaser of lost causes.

949
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,998
Now you even chase mine.

950
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,875
But you're asking
the wrong question.

951
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:21,546
Yeah, Cuba was a disappointment,
but we all cry on our birthday.

952
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:26,718
You need fo ask yourself,
why are we here?

953
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:29,888
Accessing media file 472.

954
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:33,391
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.

955
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,018
473.

956
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:37,646
474.

957
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:40,524
475.

958
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:45,821
476, 477, 478.

959
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,451
479.

960
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,545
Logan Ash.
A pleasure fo meet you.

961
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:02,754
Oh, my God, that's him.

962
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,464
I am sorry for your loss.

963
01:29:04,548 --> 01:29:07,551
I believe you know
who [I represent and work for?

964
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:09,719
We have an opportunity for you.

965
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:13,723
You keep coming back to me.
I thought I'd never see you again,

966
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:17,769
- but fate draws us back together.
- Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

967
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,147
- Go.
- Yep. Let me know what happens.

968
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:23,024
Now your enemy is my enemy.

969
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,359
How did that happen?

970
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:25,986
Well, you live long enough...

971
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,195
- Yeah.

972
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,363
Look at us.

973
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:33,410
Two old men in a hole trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

974
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,498
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

975
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,668
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

976
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:42,878
She is irrelevant.

977
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,381
Mmm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

978
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,718
You said it yourself,
she's very good at hiding things.

979
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:54,014
And when her secret
finds its way out, and it will,

980
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:55,640
it'll be the death of you.

981
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,434
Just give me a name.

982
01:29:57,517 --> 01:29:58,852
- Madeleine.
- Oh...

983
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:02,981
Please, just... Please, no games.

984
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,442
Madeleine.

985
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,113
Do you know what?
The two of you should come see me.

986
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:12,157
A little couples therapy.

987
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,243
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

988
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:18,955
Just tell me who they are,
Blofeld...

989
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,209
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

990
01:30:23,293 --> 01:30:26,838
No, I don't want you to leave.
We're just getting reacquainted.

991
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,180
Oh, all right. Come.

992
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,684
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

993
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,604
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

994
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,153
Careful, Bond.

995
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:51,780
It was me.

996
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:54,950
You destroyed Spectre?

997
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:58,244
No.
Vesper's grave.

998
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:00,455
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

999
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:05,085
I knew you'd come visit it.
I just needed to wait for the bon moment.

1000
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,838
She led you straight there
from the goodness of her heart.

1001
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,841
And then you left her for me.

1002
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,134
It doesn't matter.

1003
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,221
Oh, but it does.
She still does, doesn't she?

1004
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,515
My poor little cuckoo.

1005
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,978
You were always
SO very, very sensitive.

1006
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:27,232
This isn't working.

1007
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,525
Keep going.

1008
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,112
All this wasted time,
the life you could have had.

1009
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:36,741
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful, so exquisitely beautiful,

1010
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:39,744
is that you're coming to me
looking for answers,

1011
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:42,706
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

1012
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:43,873
It's Madeleine.

1013
01:31:43,957 --> 01:31:47,127
She holds the secrets you need.
All of them.

1014
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,920
I didn't need to kill you.

1015
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:50,672
I'd already broken you.

1016
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,091
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

1017
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,344
like the one you gave me.

1018
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:58,763
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

1019
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:00,890
Almost.

1020
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:10,358
Die.

1021
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,028
Mmm?

1022
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,699
-Die, Blofeld. Die.

1023
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,409
Jesus. Open the door.

1024
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:20,910
- Bond!

1025
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,037
-Bond!

1026
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:23,955
-Bond!

1027
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,417
-Open the door. Bond!

1028
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,877
-Cuckoo.

1029
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,960
- What the hell are you thinking?
- Yes, I know how to interrogate an asset.

1030
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,065
This interrogation is over.

1031
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:34,924
Tanner, don't lecture me!

1032
01:32:35,008 --> 01:32:37,510
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1033
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:39,179
-in the whole bloody playbook.

1034
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:46,686
Don't move.

1035
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,990
I'm gonna need those, I'm afraid.

1036
01:33:10,919 --> 01:33:11,920
He's dead.

1037
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:17,675
It's a good thing you're not actually
related, or you'd be dead too.

1038
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:21,471
- How do I get this off?
- You don't. You can't.

1039
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:26,851
Nanobots aren't just for Christmas.

1040
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:30,605
Once Heracles is in your system,
it's there forever.

1041
01:33:36,236 --> 01:33:39,447
- Did they find the car?
- We traced it, but she abandoned it.

1042
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:42,158
They searched her flat.
She hasn't been home.

1043
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:45,286
- Is she one of them?
- I don't know.

1044
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:49,541
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1045
01:33:51,084 --> 01:33:53,711
No. I don't know her at all.

1046
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:41,176
Is that for me?

1047
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:45,221
No.

1048
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:49,142
Then why did you come?

1049
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:51,811
Because you told me to.

1050
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,648
I didn't think
you would remember.

1051
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,151
I remember everything.

1052
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:01,029
You need to tell me
who gave you the poison, Madeleine.

1053
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,115
Is he dead?

1054
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:06,326
Yes, he's dead.

1055
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:08,745
Good.

1056
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,374
He told me you didn't betray me.

1057
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:17,754
I understand
you're not built to trust people.

1058
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:20,048
Neither are you.

1059
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:22,550
Then we were fools for trying.

1060
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:24,719
I wanted to.

1061
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:34,312
I don't know
if you wanted me to come here...

1062
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:38,358
or why you tried to kill Blofeld,
or who gave you the poison to do it,

1063
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:40,041
or how long
you've been working for them,

1064
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,611
but I do know...

1065
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:48,576
that for what felt like
five minutes of my life,

1066
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,370
I wanted everything with you.

1067
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,458
And it's not because
I didn't trust.

1068
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:00,797
It was just that feeling.

1069
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:08,346
Now I've come here to find out
who gave you the poison...

1070
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:12,308
but I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1071
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,186
that I have loved you...

1072
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,356
and I will love you,

1073
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:23,486
and I do not regret a single moment
of my life that led me to you...

1074
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:28,449
except when I put you on that train.

1075
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:35,123
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1076
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,418
My timing?

1077
01:36:40,962 --> 01:36:41,963
Don't.

1078
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:52,890
My sense of humor?

1079
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,310
Don't.

1080
01:36:59,272 --> 01:37:00,273
What?

1081
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:01,774
You look...

1082
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:03,443
You look incredible.

1083
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:17,332
This is Mathilde.

1084
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,835
Um...

1085
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:23,546
Hello. I'm James.

1086
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:44,025
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1087
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,069
Well done, 007.

1088
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:48,529
Thank you, sir.
Permission for a capture or Kill.

1089
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:51,199
Have we cleared this with the Americans?

1090
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,993
Granted. And thank you for asking.

1091
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,745
By the book, sir.

1092
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,914
Your predecessor was less deferential.

1093
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:02,585
To be fair,
Commander Bond gave me the lead.

1094
01:38:03,169 --> 01:38:05,171
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1095
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:06,964
-Sir.

1096
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:08,216
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1097
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,551
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1098
01:38:11,177 --> 01:38:12,178
Thank you.

1099
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:16,516
If you hear anything,
what do you do?

1100
01:38:17,475 --> 01:38:19,227
I hide.

1101
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,521
Very good.

1102
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,817
- Bonne nuit.
- Bonne nuit.

1103
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,361
- Dites bonne nuit monsieur.
- Bonne nuit.

1104
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:30,154
Bonne nuit.

1105
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:43,543
She's not yours.

1106
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:46,379
But the...

1107
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,214
Okay, the blue eyes, the...

1108
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:51,217
She's not yours.

1109
01:38:53,219 --> 01:38:54,220
Okay.

1110
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,098
I have something to show you.

1111
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:01,644
Another child?

1112
01:39:13,406 --> 01:39:16,284
What is it with your dad
and secret rooms?

1113
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:17,368
Talk to me.

1114
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:20,329
I wanted to bring you here before.

1115
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,207
To tell you everything.

1116
01:39:24,459 --> 01:39:28,045
Blofeld ordered my father
to assassinate this family.

1117
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:29,839
The boy survived.

1118
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,551
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1119
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:40,224
When I was a little girl,
he came here to kill my father...

1120
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,353
but he found me
and my mother instead.

1121
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:47,815
He spared my life.

1122
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:51,569
And now he's back.

1123
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,280
- And what does he want?
- Revenge?

1124
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:57,867
Me?

1125
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:04,540
Who were they?

1126
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:06,375
Spectre's poisoners.

1127
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:11,172
My father held a banquet for them,
used their own recipe in the dessert.

1128
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:12,298
Dioxin.

1129
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:17,637
They would have suffered horribly.
Scarred him for life.

1130
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:20,431
The family had an island.

1131
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,518
They called it the Poison Garden.

1132
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:28,481
Oh, so...
Blofeld took it from them

1133
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:29,690
and kept running it,

1134
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:33,027
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1135
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,286
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

1136
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:44,872
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,

1137
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:47,375
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.

1138
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:51,254
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1139
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:54,215
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1140
01:40:58,135 --> 01:40:59,762
I'll send you my location shortly.

1141
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:05,685
You're going to find him?

1142
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:11,566
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1143
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:16,028
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

1144
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:27,748
I'm hungry.

1145
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:52,857
How is it?

1146
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:56,360
Not bad.

1147
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:07,747
Excuse me.

1148
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:09,290
Yes?

1149
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:10,374
Bond.

1150
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:11,667
Did you find the island?

1151
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:13,753
Yes, it's part of a chain

1152
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:16,213
in disputed waters
between Japan and Russia.

1153
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:19,884
There's a chemical plant
aating back to the Second World War.

1154
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:21,844
Seems fo have had quite a history.

1155
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:26,098
Sir, Japanese intelligence have reported
suspicious activity on the island.

1156
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:29,101
Q, bring up the satellite images
I just sent through.

1157
01:42:30,311 --> 01:42:32,146
These were taken
over the last few days.

1158
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:36,025
If that is Safin there...

1159
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,777
Then Heracles is there too.

1160
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:39,278
Where do you need
this plane, Bond?

1161
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:40,363
Hang on, Q.

1162
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:42,490
Did 007 manage to locate Logan Ash?

1163
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:45,534
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.

1164
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:56,087
I thought she was following
Logan Ash, not me.

1165
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,338
What? She is.

1166
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:59,298
James, where are you?

1167
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:04,887
Put her in the back.

1168
01:43:06,889 --> 01:43:09,308
There you are.
In you get. Watch your head.

1169
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:14,897
Where are we going?

1170
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,900
We're going on
an adventure, darling. Hang on.

1171
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,741
Q, I am gonna need
that plane, quickly.

1172
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,911
I'm near @rland NATO base.
You think you can get it to me?

1173
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:30,413
Right, yes. We'll be there.

1174
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,164
Thank you.

1175
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:33,248
Maman...

1176
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,626
A mosquito bit me.

1177
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:37,878
It's okay.

1178
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:39,880
Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes?

1179
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:01,359
Maman...

1180
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:03,863
Do mosquitoes have friends?

1181
01:44:03,946 --> 01:44:05,239
I don't know.

1182
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:10,578
I don't think so.

1183
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:27,928
-Hang on.

1184
01:44:38,731 --> 01:44:39,732
James.

1185
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,789
Mathilde!

1186
01:46:03,691 --> 01:46:05,150
They're above us!

1187
01:46:32,344 --> 01:46:33,512
Get out of here!

1188
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:34,596
James!

1189
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:13,320
You stay here.

1190
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:15,364
I'll be back soon.

1191
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:19,076
Anybody comes through that door,
you shoot them.

1192
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:20,411
Unless it's me.

1193
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,789
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.

1194
01:49:39,948 --> 01:49:41,033
Hey!

1195
01:49:56,799 --> 01:49:57,841
Go! Go!

1196
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,641
There! Run him over!

1197
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,546
Nice moves, Bond.

1198
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:38,882
You won't be able to stop him...

1199
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:42,469
so, why don't you
help me out, brother?

1200
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:44,888
I had a brother.

1201
01:50:47,307 --> 01:50:48,851
His name was Felix Leiter.

1202
01:52:11,183 --> 01:52:12,517
Need a ride?

1203
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:15,229
Where have you been?

1204
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:17,606
Chasing after your lead.

1205
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:22,152
Ash?

1206
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:23,320
Dead.

1207
01:52:26,114 --> 01:52:27,699
They took Dr. Swann.

1208
01:52:28,659 --> 01:52:29,743
And her daughter.

1209
01:52:32,037 --> 01:52:34,623
I didn't know she had a daughter.

1210
01:52:35,457 --> 01:52:36,833
Did M get my plane?

1211
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,879
Our plane.
I'm coming with you.

1212
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:45,091
Thank you, 007.

1213
01:53:08,824 --> 01:53:10,033
Hello, Q.

1214
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:11,118
Bond.

1215
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:14,454
Sorry to get you out of bed.

1216
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,959
The objectives of this mission
are threefold.

1217
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:23,005
Confirm the presence of Heracles.
Kill Obruchev and Safin.

1218
01:53:23,088 --> 01:53:26,383
Get Dr. Swann and her daughter
off the island.

1219
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:29,219
And, Bond, I hope they're there.

1220
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,138
Thank you, sir.

1221
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:32,222
Sir.

1222
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:37,436
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.

1223
01:53:40,188 --> 01:53:41,189
It's just a number.

1224
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:42,274
Very well.

1225
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:43,859
Agreed.

1226
01:53:44,818 --> 01:53:46,111
Good luck.

1227
01:53:46,194 --> 01:53:48,155
Bond, your watch.

1228
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:53,910
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.

1229
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,913
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network

1230
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,123
if you get close enough.

1231
01:53:58,206 --> 01:53:59,291
Mm-hmm.

1232
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:01,960
And how strong is it?

1233
01:54:03,003 --> 01:54:04,629
It's fairly strong.

1234
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:06,715
"Fairly strong." What's that mean?

1235
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:09,718
We haven't had the chance
to test it properly. Just be careful.

1236
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:11,678
Right, this is Q.DAR.

1237
01:54:12,346 --> 01:54:14,473
It will map the space
as you move through it.

1238
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,185
Don't touch that.

1239
01:54:19,436 --> 01:54:21,897
And smart blood will track you...

1240
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:24,524
Whoops... and your vitals.

1241
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:34,034
Bond, you don't mind a shot or two
whilst at work?

1242
01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,869
- Shall we?
- Well, I haven't had a drink

1243
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:37,204
-for three or four hou...

1244
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:38,914
- Hours.
- Wow.

1245
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,917
Doesn't sound like you.

1246
01:54:43,627 --> 01:54:44,836
-Ow!

1247
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,296
Good.

1248
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,799
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.

1249
01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:49,966
No, no idea.

1250
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:52,010
Gravity.

1251
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:13,990
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.

1252
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:16,368
Welcome to your family.

1253
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:18,578
How are you progressing?

1254
01:55:18,662 --> 01:55:20,705
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.

1255
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:22,207
My request?

1256
01:55:22,874 --> 01:55:23,875
Svetlana?

1257
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:33,718
Continue.

1258
01:55:34,219 --> 01:55:35,637
What is that?

1259
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:36,763
Insurance.

1260
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:41,184
A simple hair falls from your head,
and now I have your life in my hands.

1261
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:44,563
And yours.

1262
01:55:46,106 --> 01:55:48,942
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.

1263
01:55:50,569 --> 01:55:52,696
You're any less damaged?

1264
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,490
You love a killer.

1265
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,911
You bore his child
despite his rejection.

1266
01:56:00,871 --> 01:56:03,081
You've hidden and lied
your whole life.

1267
01:56:03,665 --> 01:56:05,584
You will do anything...

1268
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:06,835
To survive.

1269
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:13,717
You understand me
the same way I understand you.

1270
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:17,637
Move.

1271
01:56:27,355 --> 01:56:29,107
My father's garden.

1272
01:56:29,733 --> 01:56:31,860
It was his toxic treasure.

1273
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:33,737
Let me show her.

1274
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:34,821
Give her to me.

1275
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:36,531
No.

1276
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,076
I can protect her.

1277
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:45,373
Mathilde.

1278
01:56:45,457 --> 01:56:48,502
Remember what I told you.
Don't touch anything. Okay?

1279
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:55,926
Mathilde.

1280
01:56:56,510 --> 01:56:58,136
It's a poison garden...

1281
01:56:59,596 --> 01:57:01,598
but it's perfectly safe.

1282
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:02,974
-Shh.

1283
01:57:04,059 --> 01:57:05,560
My father made this.

1284
01:57:06,102 --> 01:57:10,273
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1285
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:15,445
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1286
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:21,743
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1287
01:57:21,826 --> 01:57:24,079
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1288
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:27,457
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1289
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,382
Mathilde!

1290
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:37,551
No.

1291
01:57:39,094 --> 01:57:41,012
This one makes you
do as you're told.

1292
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:43,807
So you never misbehave,

1293
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,433
and you're always good.

1294
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:47,394
You mustn't misbehave, Mathilde.

1295
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:50,522
And neither must your mother.

1296
01:57:53,191 --> 01:57:54,192
Ever.

1297
01:57:57,529 --> 01:57:59,447
- Do you like it here?
- No.

1298
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:02,534
Well, you will learn to.

1299
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:05,829
I grew up here, and you will too.

1300
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,085
Such a beautiful child.

1301
01:58:14,462 --> 01:58:15,964
Perhaps we should have some tea.

1302
01:58:16,047 --> 01:58:17,257
- No.
- Make her see the light.

1303
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,301
No. No, you can't separate us!

1304
01:58:19,384 --> 01:58:20,677
- Mathilde!
- Maman!

1305
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:23,388
Remember what I told you!
I'll come looking for you!

1306
01:58:23,471 --> 01:58:24,472
Okay?

1307
01:58:26,433 --> 01:58:27,559
Don't worry.

1308
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:31,229
You have me.

1309
01:58:40,405 --> 01:58:43,533
As soon as you have a line of sight
on the island, drop alfitude,

1310
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:44,909
stay below radar.

1311
01:58:49,497 --> 01:58:51,166
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1312
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,460
-Nope.

1313
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,845
Don't forget fo release the chute,
and open the wings.

1314
01:59:03,928 --> 01:59:05,430
Gravity isn't always your friend.

1315
01:59:21,696 --> 01:59:24,491
Look for a concrete structure
on the west side of the island.

1316
01:59:25,533 --> 01:59:27,243
That's your best bet for getting in.

1317
02:00:13,498 --> 02:00:14,958
Coming up for air, Q.

1318
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:17,210
Right, good.

1319
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:20,964
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1320
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:24,843
Doesn't seem fo get much activity,
but look out for cameras anyway.

1321
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:27,345
Use your watch, Bond.

1322
02:00:38,481 --> 02:00:41,234
- What's going on?
- It's the equipment.

1323
02:00:41,317 --> 02:00:42,902
The cameras are down.

1324
02:00:43,611 --> 02:00:45,029
The whole lower sector.

1325
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:47,365
I'll restart the system.

1326
02:01:02,797 --> 02:01:03,798
Okay.

1327
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:05,008
Ah. There you go.

1328
02:01:05,925 --> 02:01:07,343
Sir, they're in.

1329
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:08,845
Yes, we have it.

1330
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:11,282
You should be able to see
the chemical plant's architecture.

1331
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:12,307
Which one's Bond?

1332
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:16,519
He's the psi.
He's the trident thingy.

1333
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:18,146
Give us the layout.

1334
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:19,522
Right.

1335
02:01:19,606 --> 02:01:23,443
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1336
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:27,030
The main activity should be
fowards the central hub,

1337
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,573
which is directly above you.

1338
02:02:02,065 --> 02:02:03,525
Bond.

1339
02:02:03,608 --> 02:02:05,401
Bond, there's something...

1340
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:08,488
There's something big up ahead.
I can't work out what it is. It's...

1341
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:11,157
These walls must be thick.

1342
02:02:17,622 --> 02:02:18,623
Bond.

1343
02:02:19,916 --> 02:02:22,126
Bond? 007, do you read me?

1344
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:25,463
- We've lost them.
- They've entered a blind spot, sir.

1345
02:02:25,547 --> 02:02:27,841
I can't work out
what it is they've walked into.

1346
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:29,509
Well, just get them back.

1347
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,627
Well, will you look
at those doors.

1348
02:03:05,587 --> 02:03:07,213
This was a missile silo.

1349
02:03:07,297 --> 02:03:08,298
Right.

1350
02:03:10,174 --> 02:03:11,175
Let's go.

1351
02:03:18,892 --> 02:03:20,268
- Everybody, over there.

1352
02:03:20,351 --> 02:03:21,352
In the corner. Now.

1353
02:03:22,103 --> 02:03:23,771
- What? How?
- Move!

1354
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:25,815
Move! On the ground!

1355
02:03:27,275 --> 02:03:28,276
Alarm.

1356
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:31,946
Down, boy.

1357
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:51,132
What are you doing?

1358
02:03:51,215 --> 02:03:55,595
You cannot explode laboratory, please.

1359
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:01,267
This is suicide mission.

1360
02:04:01,976 --> 02:04:03,269
Come on.

1361
02:04:03,353 --> 02:04:05,897
You will never leave this island alive.

1362
02:04:12,195 --> 02:04:13,404
That was the farm.

1363
02:04:14,906 --> 02:04:16,407
And this is the factory.

1364
02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:30,880
They're mass-producing it.

1365
02:04:30,964 --> 02:04:32,382
Nomi, come and look at this.

1366
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:34,968
Well, look, you cannot stop it, mister.

1367
02:04:35,051 --> 02:04:37,178
We have big plan, you know.

1368
02:04:37,261 --> 02:04:38,930
- We have big numbers.
- What is it?

1369
02:04:39,013 --> 02:04:42,266
It's a simulation.
They're not just attacking individuals...

1370
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,601
They're going to kill millions.

1371
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:46,896
It will not fit in a suitcase
this time, lady.

1372
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,065
He's really getting on my nerves.

1373
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,525
Well, shut him up.

1374
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:53,820
Ow!

1375
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,197
My nose.

1376
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:01,828
We have to destroy
this whole facility.

1377
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:03,955
There is no need for violence.

1378
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:06,207
Mr. Safin, they use explosives.

1379
02:05:06,290 --> 02:05:07,583
Shut up.

1380
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:09,043
Mr. Bond...

1381
02:05:10,003 --> 02:05:13,881
you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.

1382
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:18,011
Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?

1383
02:05:18,094 --> 02:05:19,429
Like adults.

1384
02:05:21,889 --> 02:05:23,808
Safin. Where is he?

1385
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:30,440
If I don't come back...

1386
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:33,067
blow it all to shit.

1387
02:05:34,152 --> 02:05:35,778
We don't have
enough explosives for that.

1388
02:05:35,862 --> 02:05:37,655
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1389
02:05:56,924 --> 02:05:59,761
He said you must drink.
For your health.

1390
02:05:59,844 --> 02:06:03,347
Do you trust him?
He made me kill your last master.

1391
02:06:03,431 --> 02:06:05,558
Why do you think
he let you join him?

1392
02:06:05,641 --> 02:06:09,020
I think he wants you to drink.

1393
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:14,275
I want him
to give me my daughter back.

1394
02:06:14,358 --> 02:06:17,570
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

1395
02:06:27,914 --> 02:06:29,916
Do you know what this flower does?

1396
02:06:35,588 --> 02:06:36,964
It makes you blind.

1397
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:42,053
Just a drop of this in your eye,
and you'll never see again.

1398
02:06:44,347 --> 02:06:47,308
Losing one eye is a tragedy.
Losing two...

1399
02:06:47,892 --> 02:06:50,144
- No games.
- This is not a game.

1400
02:07:29,058 --> 02:07:30,101
Welcome.

1401
02:07:31,811 --> 02:07:32,812
On the floor.

1402
02:07:42,029 --> 02:07:43,114
Your sidearm.

1403
02:07:44,782 --> 02:07:45,783
Careful.

1404
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:52,915
She is light as a feather.

1405
02:07:52,999 --> 02:07:54,000
All right!

1406
02:08:05,094 --> 02:08:06,095
Please, sit.

1407
02:08:12,602 --> 02:08:13,895
It's going to be all right.

1408
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,190
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

1409
02:08:17,773 --> 02:08:19,066
James Bond.

1410
02:08:19,942 --> 02:08:22,236
History of violence.

1411
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:23,779
License to kill.

1412
02:08:24,947 --> 02:08:27,408
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

1413
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:29,785
In love with Madeleine Swann.

1414
02:08:31,412 --> 02:08:33,789
I could be speaking to my own reflection.

1415
02:08:33,873 --> 02:08:35,791
We've made slightly different choices.

1416
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:36,876
No.

1417
02:08:36,959 --> 02:08:40,129
We've just developed different methods
for the same goal.

1418
02:08:41,464 --> 02:08:43,466
Only your skills die with your body.

1419
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:47,178
Mine will survive long after I'm gone.

1420
02:08:48,012 --> 02:08:51,432
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1421
02:08:53,643 --> 02:08:54,644
Isn't it?

1422
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:57,855
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1423
02:08:59,148 --> 02:09:01,943
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

1424
02:09:02,026 --> 02:09:03,236
What do you think?

1425
02:09:06,364 --> 02:09:08,532
I think you're right.

1426
02:09:10,034 --> 02:09:11,035
Thank you.

1427
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:12,870
I think we are the same.

1428
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:17,959
We both know what it feels like
to have everything taken from us

1429
02:09:18,042 --> 02:09:19,877
before we're even in the fight.

1430
02:09:20,878 --> 02:09:27,426
It would have been nice to have a chance,
you know, don't you think?

1431
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:30,930
Just... we all should get a chance.

1432
02:09:31,514 --> 02:09:33,474
But this thing that you're building,

1433
02:09:33,557 --> 02:09:38,229
it puts everyone,
the whole world on a battlefield.

1434
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:40,398
Nobody gets a chance.

1435
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:46,904
The thing that no one wants to admit

1436
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:51,033
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1437
02:09:51,117 --> 02:09:55,955
We tell each other lies about
the fight for free will and independence,

1438
02:09:56,038 --> 02:09:58,624
but we don't really want that.

1439
02:09:59,583 --> 02:10:01,627
We want to be told how to live

1440
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:04,964
and then die when we are not looking.

1441
02:10:06,424 --> 02:10:09,427
People want oblivion,

1442
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:14,098
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1443
02:10:16,058 --> 02:10:20,271
So, here I am, their invisible god...

1444
02:10:21,856 --> 02:10:24,608
sneaking under their skin.

1445
02:10:25,735 --> 02:10:28,404
You know that history isn't kind
to those who play God.

1446
02:10:28,487 --> 02:10:29,655
And you don't?

1447
02:10:31,282 --> 02:10:35,703
We both eradicate people
to make the world a better place.

1448
02:10:36,454 --> 02:10:38,122
I just want to be a little...

1449
02:10:40,249 --> 02:10:41,500
tidier.

1450
02:10:42,084 --> 02:10:44,086
Without collateral.

1451
02:10:44,795 --> 02:10:49,050
I want the world to evolve,
yet you want it to stay the same.

1452
02:10:50,217 --> 02:10:51,510
Let's face it...

1453
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:56,182
I've made you redundant.

1454
02:10:56,265 --> 02:10:57,308
No.

1455
02:10:58,517 --> 02:11:00,978
Not as long as there are people
like you in the world.

1456
02:11:02,438 --> 02:11:08,736
And with all due respect to the enormity
of your tidy achievements,

1457
02:11:09,612 --> 02:11:14,825
all you're really doing is standing
in a very long line of angry little men.

1458
02:11:14,909 --> 02:11:18,371
I'm not angry, just passionate.

1459
02:11:20,289 --> 02:11:22,917
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1460
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,879
and you can take
this precious little angel with you.

1461
02:11:28,589 --> 02:11:29,590
And Madeleine?

1462
02:11:31,425 --> 02:11:34,095
- She stays.
- You know I can't do that.

1463
02:11:35,096 --> 02:11:37,640
Ah. That is a shame.

1464
02:11:38,432 --> 02:11:40,684
She really hoped you would.

1465
02:11:40,768 --> 02:11:43,229
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

1466
02:11:43,312 --> 02:11:45,314
You have her tell me that.

1467
02:11:46,190 --> 02:11:50,611
What mother wouldn't sacrifice herself
for her own child?

1468
02:11:52,988 --> 02:11:54,407
Is that what happened to yours?

1469
02:12:00,371 --> 02:12:03,332
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1470
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:09,171
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1471
02:12:12,675 --> 02:12:14,051
I'll do whatever you want.

1472
02:12:14,135 --> 02:12:15,428
Yes, you will.

1473
02:12:18,889 --> 02:12:20,099
I apologize.

1474
02:12:23,602 --> 02:12:24,687
I'm sorry.

1475
02:12:25,855 --> 02:12:27,815
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1476
02:12:28,983 --> 02:12:31,694
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1477
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:35,281
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1478
02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:38,033
No. No. No. No. No.

1479
02:12:39,827 --> 02:12:40,953
I am sorry.

1480
02:12:42,538 --> 02:12:43,539
I'm sorry.

1481
02:12:45,833 --> 02:12:47,751
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1482
02:12:51,297 --> 02:12:52,840
This is power.

1483
02:12:52,923 --> 02:12:53,924
I'm sorry.

1484
02:12:54,758 --> 02:12:57,636
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1485
02:13:07,313 --> 02:13:08,647
James!

1486
02:13:08,731 --> 02:13:10,316
-Where is she?

1487
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:17,406
The first shipment is on the dock
ready for pickup, Doctor.

1488
02:13:17,490 --> 02:13:18,616
Very good.

1489
02:13:19,783 --> 02:13:20,910
My Dou Dou.

1490
02:13:41,055 --> 02:13:43,474
If you don't want
my protection, then...

1491
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:46,185
off you go.

1492
02:13:56,445 --> 02:13:59,615
Move. Our first buyers are arriving.

1493
02:14:12,378 --> 02:14:15,631
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1494
02:14:15,714 --> 02:14:18,384
Several high-speed transports
are headed fowards the island.

1495
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:21,554
Origin unknown. Still no sign of 007.

1496
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:25,599
Come on, Bond. Where the hell are you?

1497
02:14:26,225 --> 02:14:29,603
This is hopeless situation, lady. Please.

1498
02:14:32,314 --> 02:14:34,066
- Bond.

1499
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:35,818
Bond.

1500
02:14:36,694 --> 02:14:39,238
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1501
02:14:39,321 --> 02:14:41,782
Look, lady, please,
please just let me go.

1502
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,077
There was never gonna be
a way out.

1503
02:14:46,537 --> 02:14:49,623
Stop this nonsense.
You don't have a chance, anyways.

1504
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:54,712
Hey. Hey.
I have a good vial for your people,

1505
02:14:54,795 --> 02:14:57,172
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

1506
02:14:57,256 --> 02:14:58,424
-Whoal

1507
02:15:14,064 --> 02:15:16,400
You know, I do not need laboratory

1508
02:15:16,483 --> 02:15:19,320
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

1509
02:15:21,071 --> 02:15:23,407
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?

1510
02:15:23,991 --> 02:15:25,242
Time to die.

1511
02:15:25,326 --> 02:15:27,202
No!

1512
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:38,631
Move! Move!

1513
02:15:43,594 --> 02:15:46,472
They dropped down to a lower level.
There has to be a stairwell down.

1514
02:15:46,555 --> 02:15:47,765
Maman!

1515
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:52,144
Maman!

1516
02:15:52,227 --> 02:15:54,271
I lost my little Dou Dou.

1517
02:15:56,231 --> 02:15:58,192
Mathilde. Mathilde.

1518
02:16:01,904 --> 02:16:04,031
I looked for you all over.

1519
02:16:04,114 --> 02:16:05,282
Where were you?

1520
02:16:05,366 --> 02:16:07,743
I hid like you told me.

1521
02:16:09,578 --> 02:16:11,580
I love you.

1522
02:16:11,664 --> 02:16:13,499
Me too. I love you.

1523
02:16:13,582 --> 02:16:14,708
We should go.

1524
02:16:15,376 --> 02:16:16,460
Yeah.

1525
02:16:17,044 --> 02:16:18,337
It's Q. Do you read me?

1526
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:21,382
Come in, 007. It's Q.

1527
02:16:26,553 --> 02:16:28,180
Traffic. We have traffic.

1528
02:16:28,263 --> 02:16:29,598
I think we just got buzzed.

1529
02:16:29,682 --> 02:16:31,058
Those are two Russian MiGs.

1530
02:16:31,141 --> 02:16:32,559
Traffic. TCAS, you have control.

1531
02:16:32,643 --> 02:16:34,687
I understand,
and I'm doing the best that I can.

1532
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:36,647
Just please wait.

1533
02:16:37,481 --> 02:16:39,566
Sir, I've got the Navy,
the Japanese, the Russians,

1534
02:16:39,650 --> 02:16:40,818
all breathing down my neck,

1535
02:16:40,901 --> 02:16:44,738
demanding to know why we've got
a C-17 circling a disputed island.

1536
02:16:48,158 --> 02:16:50,285
Don't tell them anything just yet.

1537
02:17:08,512 --> 02:17:09,638
Ah. Just in time.

1538
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:11,849
Nomi, you know...

1539
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:15,102
Madeleine, Mathilde, they're my...

1540
02:17:15,185 --> 02:17:16,186
- Hey.
- Hi.

1541
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:22,151
Q. Q, are you there?

1542
02:17:22,234 --> 02:17:23,235
Yes, Bond.

1543
02:17:23,819 --> 02:17:27,489
Do we have any Royal Naval vessels
in the immediate vicinity?

1544
02:17:28,115 --> 02:17:29,283
Uh, yes. Why?

1545
02:17:29,366 --> 02:17:31,952
We are gonna need
an immediate strike on this location.

1546
02:17:32,035 --> 02:17:36,582
This whole island,
it's a manufacturing plant for Heracles.

1547
02:17:36,665 --> 02:17:38,876
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

1548
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:40,544
Mm-mmm.

1549
02:17:40,627 --> 02:17:42,504
Bond, there's something else
you should know.

1550
02:17:42,588 --> 02:17:45,340
Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.

1551
02:17:45,966 --> 02:17:48,427
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

1552
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:50,804
Uh, 20 minutes.

1553
02:17:50,888 --> 02:17:52,806
Q, patch me through.

1554
02:17:53,682 --> 02:17:55,601
- 007.
- M.

1555
02:17:55,684 --> 02:17:58,562
Our operation is attracting
a lot of international attention.

1556
02:17:59,271 --> 02:18:00,689
We're seeing what we can do.

1557
02:18:00,773 --> 02:18:01,774
Come on.

1558
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:04,443
Let's go.

1559
02:18:11,825 --> 02:18:15,204
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

1560
02:18:16,205 --> 02:18:17,623
I want you to have this.

1561
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,251
That'll keep you warm.

1562
02:18:26,465 --> 02:18:29,218
I have to finish this. For us.

1563
02:18:30,302 --> 02:18:31,345
I know.

1564
02:18:41,563 --> 02:18:43,065
I'll just be a minute.

1565
02:18:49,822 --> 02:18:51,156
I've got them.

1566
02:18:52,407 --> 02:18:53,575
This might come in handy.

1567
02:18:54,993 --> 02:18:56,036
Thank you.

1568
02:19:18,851 --> 02:19:20,602
Q, talk to me.

1569
02:19:20,686 --> 02:19:23,730
Our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.

1570
02:19:24,273 --> 02:19:26,108
Bond, M here.

1571
02:19:26,191 --> 02:19:28,777
The situation is diplomatically complex.

1572
02:19:28,861 --> 02:19:31,989
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

1573
02:19:32,072 --> 02:19:34,157
If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese

1574
02:19:34,241 --> 02:19:36,535
and even the Americans will want answers.

1575
02:19:36,618 --> 02:19:38,078
Well, don't give them any.

1576
02:19:40,789 --> 02:19:42,332
Rational minds, Bond.

1577
02:19:42,416 --> 02:19:45,252
I'm trying fo save this
from escalating to all-out war.

1578
02:19:46,712 --> 02:19:51,174
Mallory, if we don't do this,
there will be nothing left to save.

1579
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:54,219
Fire on my mark.

1580
02:19:55,178 --> 02:19:57,723
007, there's another problem.
That room you were just in.

1581
02:19:57,806 --> 02:20:00,392
Yes, I know, I know,
I've got to open the blast doors.

1582
02:20:00,475 --> 02:20:03,478
Otherwise our missiles will bounce off it
like they've hit a trampoline.

1583
02:20:03,562 --> 02:20:05,439
Yes, I know, I know.

1584
02:20:07,149 --> 02:20:08,317
Find the control room.

1585
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:11,236
It should be in a tower
just above the blast doors.

1586
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,947
The missiles will take
about nine minutes from launch.

1587
02:20:14,031 --> 02:20:16,283
Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?

1588
02:20:16,366 --> 02:20:17,868
Plenty of time, plenty of time.

1589
02:23:34,314 --> 02:23:36,900
Bond. Bond, do you read me?

1590
02:23:38,401 --> 02:23:40,654
Yeah.

1591
02:23:40,737 --> 02:23:42,030
Yeah, Q.

1592
02:23:42,114 --> 02:23:44,866
- I read you.
- Sounds like you're in a rugby scrum.

1593
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:46,952
I just showed someone your watch.

1594
02:23:48,411 --> 02:23:50,080
Really blew their mind.

1595
02:23:52,499 --> 02:23:55,544
Right, good.
Now, did you find the control room?

1596
02:23:57,129 --> 02:23:59,965
Well, my Russian is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.

1597
02:24:13,728 --> 02:24:14,729
Okay, Q.

1598
02:24:14,813 --> 02:24:17,524
I've done some research.
Old schematics...

1599
02:24:17,607 --> 02:24:19,651
Q, I am gonna need some...

1600
02:24:19,734 --> 02:24:20,819
Yes?

1601
02:24:22,445 --> 02:24:23,864
-Bond?

1602
02:24:26,324 --> 02:24:27,325
Hello?

1603
02:24:27,409 --> 02:24:29,411
- Power.
- Power?

1604
02:24:29,494 --> 02:24:32,080
Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,

1605
02:24:32,164 --> 02:24:35,375
so it's going to be an overly complicated
and intricate switching system.

1606
02:24:36,168 --> 02:24:39,880
Now, the order in which you engage it
will need to be extremely precise.

1607
02:24:40,630 --> 02:24:42,966
-You're looking for a control panel.

1608
02:24:43,049 --> 02:24:45,510
-There should be a counterweight clutch.

1609
02:24:46,428 --> 02:24:49,514
So, listen very carefully, 007.
The first thing you need fo do...

1610
02:24:49,598 --> 02:24:50,932
Got it.

1611
02:24:52,142 --> 02:24:53,185
I think.

1612
02:25:07,324 --> 02:25:08,992
Yep, that's it. Launch the missiles.

1613
02:25:09,075 --> 02:25:12,662
- Not until you're clear.
- Q, tell M to launch the missiles now.

1614
02:25:13,872 --> 02:25:14,873
Okay. Okay, okay.

1615
02:25:15,457 --> 02:25:16,458
Understood.

1616
02:25:17,167 --> 02:25:19,419
M, Bond says fire.

1617
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:22,547
HMS Dragon here.

1618
02:25:22,631 --> 02:25:23,632
Admiral.

1619
02:25:23,715 --> 02:25:24,758
Sir.

1620
02:25:25,467 --> 02:25:26,635
M here.

1621
02:25:26,718 --> 02:25:28,053
What are my instructions?

1622
02:25:28,803 --> 02:25:30,764
You have permission to launch.

1623
02:25:30,847 --> 02:25:32,641
Roger. Launching the strike.

1624
02:25:47,155 --> 02:25:49,616
Missiles airborne. Nine minutes out.

1625
02:26:18,603 --> 02:26:19,938
No.

1626
02:26:21,147 --> 02:26:22,732
No. No, no!

1627
02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:59,269
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.

1628
02:27:28,173 --> 02:27:33,428
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.

1629
02:27:35,805 --> 02:27:39,059
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.

1630
02:27:46,524 --> 02:27:50,320
Anyone we touch, we are their curse.

1631
02:27:51,196 --> 02:27:53,156
A stroke to their cheek...

1632
02:27:53,823 --> 02:27:55,116
a kiss...

1633
02:27:56,659 --> 02:27:58,828
would kill them instantly.

1634
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:04,876
Yes...

1635
02:28:06,127 --> 02:28:07,379
Madeleine.

1636
02:28:10,048 --> 02:28:13,885
Yes, Mathilde.

1637
02:28:30,610 --> 02:28:32,779
You made me do this, you see.

1638
02:28:37,909 --> 02:28:39,911
This was your choice.

1639
02:29:27,459 --> 02:29:29,502
Q. Q, are you there?

1640
02:29:29,586 --> 02:29:30,712
Bond, there you are.

1641
02:29:30,795 --> 02:29:32,005
Are they safe, Q?

1642
02:29:32,088 --> 02:29:34,466
Yes, they're safe.

1643
02:29:34,549 --> 02:29:36,426
Bond, have you left the island?

1644
02:29:37,218 --> 02:29:39,512
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.

1645
02:29:40,597 --> 02:29:41,764
Won't take a sec.

1646
02:29:43,349 --> 02:29:44,809
No, no, no. Bond...

1647
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:48,688
The missiles have already launched.
Just get out of there.

1648
02:29:59,115 --> 02:30:01,242
Q, how dol I...

1649
02:30:02,118 --> 02:30:04,537
how do I destroy this?

1650
02:30:05,330 --> 02:30:07,081
If the silo doors are open,

1651
02:30:07,165 --> 02:30:09,209
-the missiles will deal with it
-No. No, no.

1652
02:30:09,292 --> 02:30:13,129
If you get it on you,
how do you get it off?

1653
02:30:13,213 --> 02:30:15,256
You know as well as I do
that you can't.

1654
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:16,925
It's permanent.

1655
02:30:17,008 --> 02:30:20,345
Its eternal.
Which is why we have fo destroy it.

1656
02:30:20,428 --> 02:30:22,889
For Christ's sake, James,
Just get off the island.

1657
02:30:23,681 --> 02:30:26,100
It's harmless
unless you're near fo the target.

1658
02:30:28,394 --> 02:30:31,731
Yeah. Well, that's not gonna work.

1659
02:30:37,695 --> 02:30:39,072
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1660
02:30:41,491 --> 02:30:42,742
It's for Madeleine.

1661
02:30:46,913 --> 02:30:48,331
It's all right, Q.

1662
02:30:49,541 --> 02:30:50,750
It's all all right.

1663
02:30:52,919 --> 02:30:54,504
Would you put Madeleine on, please?

1664
02:30:54,587 --> 02:30:56,631
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.

1665
02:31:01,803 --> 02:31:04,264
Nomi, come in.
Can you put Madeleine on?

1666
02:31:05,848 --> 02:31:06,849
Madeleine.

1667
02:31:14,440 --> 02:31:15,984
- James.
- Madeleine.

1668
02:31:16,651 --> 02:31:18,194
- I'm here.

1669
02:31:18,778 --> 02:31:19,946
Where are you?

1670
02:31:21,864 --> 02:31:22,865
Is it done?

1671
02:31:23,825 --> 02:31:26,327
- James?
- Yes. Yes, he's dead.

1672
02:31:26,411 --> 02:31:27,495
Are you both there?

1673
02:31:27,579 --> 02:31:28,580
Yes.

1674
02:31:30,331 --> 02:31:32,750
Good. You're safe. That's good.

1675
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:35,211
Have you left?

1676
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:40,550
No. Um...

1677
02:31:40,633 --> 02:31:42,885
I'm not gonna make it.

1678
02:31:45,388 --> 02:31:46,389
What?

1679
02:31:49,559 --> 02:31:50,393
No.

1680
02:31:50,476 --> 02:31:52,186
- You promised.
- Madeleine.

1681
02:31:53,229 --> 02:31:54,606
Just get off that island.

1682
02:31:56,899 --> 02:31:58,234
I know you can do this.

1683
02:32:01,195 --> 02:32:03,990
Everything's good now.

1684
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:07,535
There's no one left to hurt us.

1685
02:32:08,161 --> 02:32:09,203
Madeleine...

1686
02:32:12,457 --> 02:32:13,875
you have made...

1687
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:20,298
the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

1688
02:32:22,175 --> 02:32:23,926
She's perfect.

1689
02:32:28,139 --> 02:32:29,557
Because she came from you.

1690
02:32:41,110 --> 02:32:43,696
Oh, God. The vial.

1691
02:32:48,201 --> 02:32:49,702
You've been poisoned.

1692
02:32:51,412 --> 02:32:52,413
Yes.

1693
02:32:53,373 --> 02:32:54,624
There must be a way.

1694
02:32:59,295 --> 02:33:00,505
There must be a way.

1695
02:33:12,642 --> 02:33:14,310
We just need more time.

1696
02:33:15,353 --> 02:33:17,188
If we only had more time.

1697
02:33:22,985 --> 02:33:24,862
You have all the time in the world.

1698
02:33:29,033 --> 02:33:30,034
I love you.

1699
02:33:33,788 --> 02:33:35,206
I love you too.

1700
02:33:56,185 --> 02:33:57,895
She does have your eyes.

1701
02:34:01,691 --> 02:34:02,692
I know.

1702
02:34:17,039 --> 02:34:18,040
I know.

1703
02:35:22,730 --> 02:35:25,149
Very hard to know what to say,

1704
02:35:25,233 --> 02:35:29,195
but I thought we should gather
and remember.

1705
02:35:30,488 --> 02:35:31,823
And I...

1706
02:35:32,406 --> 02:35:36,619
I thought this was appropriate.

1707
02:35:40,873 --> 02:35:45,503
"The function of man is to live,
not to exist.

1708
02:35:48,172 --> 02:35:51,259
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.

1709
02:35:52,552 --> 02:35:55,304
I shall use my time."

1710
02:36:07,525 --> 02:36:08,526
To James.

1711
02:36:09,861 --> 02:36:11,279
- James.
- James.

1712
02:36:11,362 --> 02:36:12,405
James.

1713
02:36:15,032 --> 02:36:16,033
James.

1714
02:36:24,542 --> 02:36:27,128
Right. Back to work.

1715
02:36:44,020 --> 02:36:45,605
Mathilde.

1716
02:36:45,688 --> 02:36:46,731
Quoi?

1717
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:48,399
I'm going to tell you a story...

1718
02:36:51,277 --> 02:36:52,361
about a man.

1719
02:36:53,195 --> 02:36:54,447
His name was Bond.

1720
02:36:56,490 --> 02:36:57,825
James Bond.
