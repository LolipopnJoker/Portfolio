We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.

342
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,426
First thing they'll do in Engineering
is establish a collective,

343
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,095
a central point
from which they can control the hive.

344
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,432
The problem is, if we begin firing
particle weapons in Engineering,

345
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,435
there's a risk
that we may hit the warp core.

346
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,774

one of the plasma coolant tanks.

-Data?
-Excellent idea.

348
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,821
Plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact.

349
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,157

351
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,620

854
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:32,068
l didn't build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity.

855
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:37,657
You think l want to go to the stars?
l don't even like to fly! l take trains!

856
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,455
l built this ship so that l could retire
to some tropical island

857
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,001
filled with naked women.

858
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:51,963
That's Zefram Cochrane.
That's his vision.

859
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:56,760
This other guy you keep talking about,
this historical figure,

860
01:15:58,262 --> 01:15:59,846
l never met him.

861
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,682
l can't imagine l ever will.

862
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:08,563
Someone once said, "Don't try to be
a great man. Just be a man,

863
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:11,399
"and let history
make its own judgments."

864
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:13,568
That's rhetorical nonsense.

865
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:18,949
-Who said that?
-You did, 1 0 years from now.

866
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:23,828
You got 58 minutes, Doc.
You better get on that checklist.

867
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,831
They're on the move again.

868
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,500
The Borg just overran
three of our defense checkpoints.

869
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,503
They've taken over Decks 5 and 6.

870
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,380
They've adapted
to every modulation of our weapons.

871
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,006
lt's like we're shooting blanks.

872
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,424
We'll have to work
on finding another way

873
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,344
to modify our weapons
so they'll be more effective.

874
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,681
ln the meantime,
tell your men to stand their ground.

875
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,392
-Sir...
-Fight hand-to-hand if they have to.

876
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,436
Aye, sir.

877
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,776
Wait.
Captain, our weapons are useless.

878
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,861
We must activate
the auto-destruct sequence

879
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:59,072
and use the escape pods
to evacuate the ship.

880
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,198
No!

881
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,535
Jean-Luc, if we destroy the ship,
we destroy the Borg.

882
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,829
We're gonna stay and fight.

883
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,873
Sir, we have lost the Enterprise.
We should not sacrifice...

884
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,750
We have not lost
the Enterprise, Mr. Worf.

885
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,460
We are not going to lose the Enterprise.

886
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,754
Not to the Borg,
not while l'm in command.

887
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,674
-You have your orders.
-l must object to this course of action.

888
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:18,967
-lt is...
-The objection is noted.

889
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:20,802
With all due respect, sir,

890
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,764
l believe you are allowing
your personal experience with the Borg

891
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,975
to influence yourjudgment.

892
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,145
You're afraid.

893
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,940
You want to destroy the ship
and run away. You coward.

894
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,400
DR. CRUSHER: Jean-Luc.

895
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:41,072
lf you were any other man,
l would kill you where you stand.

896
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:43,199
Get off my Bridge.

897
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,342
-So what do we do now?
-We carry out his orders.

898
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,135
Dyson, Kaplan,

899
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,219
-start working on a way to modify...
-Wait!

900
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:04,512
-...the weapon systems.
-This is stupid!

901
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:07,515
lf we can get off this ship
and then blow it up, let's do it!

902
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,934
Once the Captain's made up his mind,
the discussion is over.

903
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,519
Lily!

904
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,275
-You son of a bitch.
-This really isn't the time.

905
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,695
Okay, l don't knowjack
about the 24th century,

906
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,781
but everybody out there thinks
that staying here

907
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,366
and fighting the Borg is suicide.

908
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,242
They're just afraid to come in here
and say it.

909
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,703
The crew is accustomed
to following my orders.

910
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:31,122
They're probably accustomed
to your orders making sense.

911
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:34,042
None of them
understand the Borg as l do.

912
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,170
No one does.

913
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,506
No one can.

914
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,466
What is that supposed to mean?

915
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:50,934
Six years ago,
they assimilated me into their collective.

916
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:56,815
l had their cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body.

917
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:01,986
l was linked to the hive mind,
every trace of individuality erased.

918
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,407
l was one of them.

919
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,159
So you can imagine, my dear,

920
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,537
l have a somewhat unique perspective
on the Borg,

921
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,747
and l know how to fight them.

922
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,999
Now, if you will excuse me,
l have work to do.

923
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,837
l am such an idiot.

924
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,967
lt's so simple.

925
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:28,054
The Borg hurt you,
and now you're going to hurt them back.

926
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,182
ln my century,
we don't succumb to revenge.

927
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,351
We have a more evolved sensibility.

928
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:35,520
Bullshit! l saw the look on your face

929
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,189
when you shot those Borg
on the Holodeck.

930
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,400
You were almost enjoying it!

931
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,530
-How dare you.
-Oh, come on, Captain.

932
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,783
You're not the first man
to get a thrill from murdering someone.

933
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,535
l see it all the time!

934
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,162
-Get out!
-Or what?

935
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:55,832
You'll kill me
like you killed Ensign Lynch?

936
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,710
-There was no way to save him.
-You didn't even try.

937
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:01,212
Where was
your evolved sensibility then?

938
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,548
-l don't have time for this.
-Hey.

939
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:07,260
l'm sorry. l didn't mean
to interrupt your little quest.

940
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,971
Captain Ahab has to go hunt his whale.

941
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:13,725
What?

942
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,853
You do have books in the 24th century?

943
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,981
-This is not about revenge.
-Liar!

944
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,066
This is about saving
the future of humanity!

945
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,903
-Jean-Luc, blow up the damn ship!
-No!

946
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,572
No!

947
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,087
l will not sacrifice the Enterprise.

948
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:47,926
We've made too many compromises
already, too many retreats.

949
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,138
They invade our space and we fall back.

950
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:56,726
They assimilate entire worlds
and we fall back.

951
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:58,853
Not again.

952
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:02,774
The line must be drawn here.
This far, no further!

953
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:09,697
And l will make them pay
for what they've done.

954
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,058
You broke your little ships.

955
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,154
See you around, Ahab.

956
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:56,494
"And he piled upon
the whale's white hump

957
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:01,165
"the sum of all the rage and hate
felt by his whole race.

958
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:07,672
"lf his chest had been a cannon,
he would have shot his heart upon it."

959
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:09,507
What?

960
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,012
Moby-Dick.

961
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,682
Actually, l never read it.

962
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:28,443
Ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him,

963
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,529
a quest for vengeance,

964
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:38,286
but in the end,
it destroyed him and his ship.

965
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,042
