00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,592
I thought the band was
getting pretty good actually.

171
00:13:27,593 --> 00:13:31,598
Yeah, yeah, we could play Holiday Inns
for the rest of our lives.

172
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:35,598
- Or Los Angeles.
- I don't want to be a studio musician.

did you ever wonder if your teachers
went home and got it on at night?

177
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:03,138
When I was in high school,
my teachers were all priests and nuns.

178
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:05,862
I had such a crush on Mr. Griffith.

179
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:09,446
- He could have taken me home anytime.
- Really?

180
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:13,746
- Mm-hmm.
- And who was this Mr. Griffith?

181
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:18,608
Oh, he was my music teacher.

I think maybe...

207
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:14,213
you and I should find some time
to work on an individual basis.

00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:16,665
- That would be great.
- I-I don't have a lot of time.

When a flat precedes
a note like this...

216
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:12,473
it indicates that the note
is to be played a half step lower.

217
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:17,434
A piece based in the F major scale
should have a flat sign...

00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:52,535

"Look on the front page?"

227
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,246

Was that because...

228
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:02,020
you weren't sure or
because your English skills...

229
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:05,592
are on the same level
as your musical theory?

enthusiasm than his students.

A teacher is two jobs.
Fill young minds with knowledge, yes.

273
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:18,993
But more important,
give those minds a compass...

274
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:21,046
so that that knowledge
doesn't go to waste.

Now, I don't know what you're doing
with the knowledge, Mr. Holland...

276
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:26,977
but as a compass you're stuck.

a lot of tough houses.

quit and go home? - Wait a minute.

284

- Or keep playing? - Wait. Aren't
we supposed to be on the same side?

285
00:22:55,879 --> 00:23:00,699
I am. It's just that I...

but I just... - Iris.

- Iris, it just took me by surprise.
That's all. - I just hoped you...

301
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,890
Let me tell you a story, okay?

302
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:35,454
When I was 15 years old, I used
to hang out at a local record store.

303
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:38,798
And there was this guy
who worked there who...

304
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,559
you know, thought he knew what I liked
and he handed me this album one day.

305
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,638
And it was John Coltrane.

306
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:50,183
So I took it home,
and I put it on the machine.

307
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:53,617
And I hated it.
I mean, I really hated it.

308
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:57,437
I just didn't get it.

309
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,621
So I...

310
00:24:59,622 --> 00:25:02,386
played it again.

311
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:07,324
I played it again,
and I played it again.

312
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:12,257
And then, I just
couldn't stop playin' it.

313
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:16,859
I kept listening
to those notes.

314
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,007
And I realized that...

315
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:26,694
that's what I wanted to do
with the rest of my life.

316
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:29,643

with John Coltrane...

the fact that...

I've made absolutely no impact on you
in the last five months.

335
00:26:56,777 --> 00:26:59,439
Mr. Sullivan.

336
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,433
Yeah?

337
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:04,495

do you like to listen to?

515
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:51,187
I don't know why.

516
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:54,445
- [Laughing]
- She swallowed that fly.

517
00:40:54,446 --> 00:40:57,592
Perhaps she'll die
The kid is a natural.

518
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:02,007
It must have been all that music you
played at my stomach while I was pregnant.

520
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:08,927
Ladies and gentlemen,
Radio City Music Hall...

521
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:13,052
is proud to present
Coltrane Gershwin Holland.

522
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:13,553
Dd.

523
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:21,846
Mr. Holland, it has
come to my attention...

524
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,183
that you are teaching
the students rock and roll.

525
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:29,457
- Is this a problem?
- "Is this a problem?" Yes, I think so.

526
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,623
Our only job is to teach.

527
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,780
We cannot teach and the students
cannot learn if there is no discipline.

528
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:38,896
Uh, I'm sorry, uh, what
exactly is your point, Gene?

529
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:43,655
My point is, rock and roll by its very
nature leads to a breakdown in discipline.

530
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:46,704
What would you like me to do?
Deny that rock and roll exists?

531
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:50,633
What I am... What we are saying is that
you should be pushing the classics.

532
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:53,313
Brahms, Mozart, Stravinsky.

533
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:55,405
Stravinsky was the music
of the Russian Revolution...

534
00:41:55,406 --> 00:41:57,481
if you want to talk about
a breakdown in discipline.

535
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:01,549
- You are deliberately exaggerating.
- How about the Kingston Trio?

536
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,048
- How about Sing Along With Mitch?
- Oh, please!

537
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:06,623
Just a minute, gentlemen.

538
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:12,568
Mr. Holland, I do not want to interfere
in the curriculum of any teacher.

539
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:15,360
But next week I have a meeting
with the school board.

540
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:18,147
And there are people
in this community who believe...

541
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:21,157
that rock and roll is a message
sent from the devil himself.

542
00:42:21,158 --> 00:42:26,110
Now when that issue comes up,
what can I tell them?

543
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:33,773
Mrs. Jacobs, you tell them...

544
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:37,621
that I am teaching music...

545
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,620
and that I will use anything...

546
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,590
from Beethoven to Billie Holiday
to rock and roll...

547
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:49,429
if I think it'll help me teach
a student... to love music.

548
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,567
That's...

549
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:55,151
a reasonable answer, Mr. Holland.

550
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:58,334
I can tell them that.

551
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:01,511
Was there something else?

552
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,515
Yes, um, have you been...

553
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:13,265
to any of the football games
this season, Mr. Holland?

554
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:16,788
I can't say that I have. No.

555
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:21,475
Well, Mrs. Jacobs and I feel
that there's something missing.

we don't wanna be here 'til it's dark.

We're not even.

Can you even up here?
Can you, like, even this...

saying when I say "even up"?

you want me to do? Take his tests for him?

No, but I bet if
he played in your band...

610
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:20,378
I could talk Jacobs into
giving him an academic credit...

611

- You know anything at all about music,
Mr. Russ? - No, sir, coach.

You don't have to say "sir,"
and I'm not a coach.

fundamentals of music...

get into the band.

I'll work hard.

Well, which instrument
do you think you'd like to play?

635
00:47:44,308 --> 00:47:48,018
Well, I was kind of thinkin' like...
How about electric guitar?

Well, this is a marching band.

last year with
Romeo and Juliet...

1009
01:16:29,663 --> 01:16:35,783
Mr. Holland and I have come up with the most
wonderful idea for this year's production.

1010
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:38,273
Well, we're not doing a full production.
We're going to do a revue.

1011
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:41,140
A George and Ira Gershwin revue...

1012
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:44,177
- with very few costumes, one set...
- Much cheaper than...

1013
01:16:44,178 --> 01:16:46,679
I know this is going to bother some of you,
but I think we have to consider...

1014
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,243
cutting the senior class
play altogether this year.

1015
01:16:49,244 --> 01:16:51,326
- Are you nuts? Yes! You know what?
- People, people.

1016
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,334
Oddly enough,
it's going to bother me!

1017

People, people. Please.

1018
01:16:55,456 --> 01:16:57,755
Let's keep in mind
why we are here.

1019
01:16:57,756 --> 01:17:01,197
We're looking for things which will keep money
in the school coffers, not take it away.

1020
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:06,058
- At the expense of what?
- I have a responsibility to the Board of Education...

1021
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,704
and there just isn't the money to fund
programs like this; Not anymore.

1022
01:17:08,705 --> 01:17:11,301
Then what am I doing here? I mean,
why are we teaching any of this?

that this year's show will make money.

- What if we get some of my football players...

1027
01:17:24,947 --> 01:17:26,882
to be the dancers
in the show...

1028

1030

It wouldn't be a farce,
because we would get them...

1031
01:17:33,922 --> 01:17:37,849
to be better than the damn June Taylor Dancers,
and then that'll shock the hell out of everybody.

You know, I'm not as popular as you.
I'm not anybody's favorite anything.

You just don't know it. - But...

just as much as you do.

and reading and writing and long division...

1520

I choose long division.

Well, I guess you can cut the
arts as much as you want, Gene.

for the morgue?

1528
01:59:46,272 --> 01:59:49,470
- Jacobs would've fought this.
- She would've lost.

Yes, she would've lost,
but she would have fought this.

are willing to give these kids today.

Mr. Holland. We've done all we can.

Then, do it again. That's what I used to tell
you when you were my student, Michael...

1537

and it served you
pretty well then.

1538

- Well, that was a different time, Mr. Holland.
- I don't think the time...

1539
02:00:23,957 --> 02:00:27,343
was that different; I think
that more was expected of us.

1540
02:00:27,344 --> 02:00:30,889
- Fifteen seconds.
- I think that the big difference is how little you people care.

1541
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:34,816
- And how lazy you've become.
- I resent your tone, Mr. Holland.

And I don't think you have any real
appreciation for our financial problems.

Oh, come on, Michael!

1544
02:00:40,652 --> 02:00:43,490
You know the big problem here is
that you people are willing...

1545
02:00:43,491 --> 02:00:47,867
to create a generation of children
who will not have the ability to think.

1546

that I'm going to take it...
