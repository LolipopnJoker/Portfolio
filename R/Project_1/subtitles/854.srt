1
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,113
As I walk through the Valley
of the Shadow of Death

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,450
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothin' left

3
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,119
'Cause I been blastin'
and laughin' so long

4
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,289
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

5
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:59,125
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

6
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,961
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

7
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:04,922
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

8
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:08,885
On my knees in the night
sayin' prayers in the street light

9
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:14,724
Been spending most their lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

10
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:20,730
They been spending most their lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

11
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:26,736
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

12
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:32,241
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

13
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:35,078
Look at the situation
they got me facin'

14
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:38,081
I can't live with no hope
I was raised by the state

15
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:41,084
So I gotta be down
with the hood team

16
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,128
Took much television-watchin'
got me chasin' dreams

17
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:47,173
I'm a educated fool
with money on my mind

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,134
Got my tin in my hand
and a gleam in my eye

19
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:53,179
I'm a loc'd out gangsta
set trippin' banga

20
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,890
And my homies is down
So don't arouse my anger

21
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,935
Fool, death ain't nothin'
but a heartbeat away

22
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,313
I'm livin' life do or die
What can I say

23
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:05,316
I'm 23, never will I live
to see 24

24
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,777
The way things is goin'
I don't know

25
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:13,783
Tell me why are we
so blind to see

26
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,915
That the ones we hurt
are you and me

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,879

29
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:38,724
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

30
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:44,522
We keep spending most our lives
living in a gangsta's paradise

31
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,608
Power and the money
Money and the power

32
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:50,653
Minute after minute
Hour after hour

33
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:54,907
Everybody's runnin', but half
of them ain't looked what's
goin' on in the kitchen

34
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,492
But I don't know what's cookin'

35
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,537
They say I got to learn
but nobody's here to teach me

36
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:02,790
lf they can't understand it
how can they reach me

37
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:05,084
I guess they can't
I guess they won't

Thank you. Mm-hmm. Okay.

00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,186

00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:09,023
Oh. No, only-- only good.

Long sleeves. Hides the tattoos.

Uh, fully accredited, except for one
term of, of supervised student teaching.

63
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:42,807
Why did you stop so close
to being certified?

64
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:47,061
Well, I met my husband and
started working for his company.

65
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,563
Uh, w-we're divorcing.

66
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,070

Miss Johnson,
I'lI-I'll cut to the chase.

teachers, Mrs. Shepherd, left,

71
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:11,961
and since then we've had
three substitute teachers.

72
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:15,882
The last one, Mrs. Gingrich,
fell ill just this morning.

73
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:19,385
So we have a fulI-time position

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,825
- Carla, they--

-Hal!
-Louanne, d-did she t-tell you

99
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,925
Yeah, yeah. No,
she told me all about it.

100
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,428
She said, you know,

I'll know who to ask, right?
- Yeah. I'll be counting on it.

103
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,940
Fly ho's and chains
and swingin' thangs

104
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,484
Save me

105
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,362
Just another young nigger

106
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,365
Just a-havin' thangs

107
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:07,577
Fly ho's and chains
and swingin' thangs

108
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:09,579
Why must I feel like that

109
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:14,625
Just another young nigger
havin' thangs

110
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:20,631
lt's to your right.

111
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,721
I guess Miss Shepherd's lesson
plans will be in her desk.

112
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,141
Very possibly.

113
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,357
This is your classroom.

114
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:46,449
- Noisy bunch, aren't they?
- Yes, but if you stand there
long enough,

115
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:48,242
they'll usually quiet down.

116
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,244
Don't try and shout over them.

117
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,164
Right. Thanks.

118
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,087
Louanne.

119
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,923
- I'm right next door.
- I wrote this about my life because
it's my shit you never heard before

120
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,592
- Why don't you live in my world
That's my point that you
been searchin' for

121
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,096
I know that you need to relax
A supported fact

122
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,598
A little history
and history of government--

123
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,767
lmmobilizing your physical
and your brain

124
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,769
With the emotion
of subliminal motivation

125
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,314
- Look at that!
- No, no, no. Not yours.

126
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,984
- White bread.
- Snappin' my fingers
appropriately when I rip

127
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:25,029
You get flipped and then I pass
the microphone to my homegirl Chris

128
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:28,699
Now I see you runnin'
I'm comin', boom, how stunnin'

129
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,952
Fast as I step
Got to earn a big rep

130
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,913
For huntin' homies like deer
Crack a beer and some heads

131
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,792
Then go find another poor person
I can trap in my cage for a night

132
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,336
Let loose, fool, run
'Cause my first meal is done

133
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:44,382
- May I have your attention, please?
- How long y'all been together?

134
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:46,426
You run, I'll shoot
'Cause your homies said 'boo' to me

135
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,053
Your life is a joke
Smoked by the A to the K

136
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:52,807
You went to bed without a trace
lnfrared dot marks the spot

137
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,977
-So duck or find your ass shot
-What happened to Miss Shepherd?

138
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,521
- Better not do that.

139
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:03,818
- What happened to Miss Shepherd?
- Ooh, no, she ain't askin' about
Miss triflin'-ass Shepherd.

140
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:06,154
You playin' yourself.
Playin' yourself.

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,116
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Listen up! Yo, listen up!

142
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:12,577
White Bread wanna know

00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,415
We killed the bitch.

144

Kick it, kick it, kick it,

Ohh! No, no, no.
Everybody, everybody. Emilio ate her.

147
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,095
Bullshit.

148
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,481
- That bitch was too ugly to eat.
- Yeah!

149
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,109
Fed her to my dogs.

150
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,911
But I'll eat you.

151
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:07,548
What is your name?

152
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:10,384
Emilio Ramirez.

153
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:17,809
- Now, Emilio!
- Emilio, you in trouble!

154
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:29,237

00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:39,539
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio!

158
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,933
Madison surrendered
to the nationalists.

159
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:06,691
Hamilton himself could have already have
composed the message that embraced--

160
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:13,823
Donna. Donna,
take over the class.

161
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:21,622
Shut up!

162
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,548
What happened to Miss Shepherd?

163
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:32,925
- Well, she quit.
- Why?

164
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,220
Well, she was a very
high-strung individual.

165
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,306
What, did she have a breakdown?

166
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,641
No. She quit before that.

167
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,227
One of the substitutes,
she had a breakdown.

168
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,939
- That's how they weed them out.
- Who are these kids, rejects from hell?

169
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:51,486
No. They're bright kids with
little or no educational skills...

170
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,697
and what we politely call
a lot of social problems.

171
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,699
Damn it, Griffith,
you could've warned me!

172
00:11:56,824 --> 00:12:00,953
Hey, Louanne,
you said you wanted to teach.

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,997
- Now, is that a load of bull or what?
- No!

174
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:04,582
- So teach.
- I ca--
- What?

175
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:07,001
I can't teach them!

176
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:11,506
Yes, you can. All you gotta do
is get their attention.

177
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,384
Or quit.

178
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:26,020
I'm back!

179
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,633
"She decided that if Brian broke a rule
she would utilize these consequences:

180
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:59,429
The first time he broke a rule his name
would be put on the board."

181
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,613
This is the life

182
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:25,204
This is the life

183
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,708
This is the life

184
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,422
Okay, you little bastards.

185
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,048
- Come on
- Put your back into it

186
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,258
- Come on
- Put your back into it

187
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,927
- Come on
- Put your back into it

188
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,637
- Come on
- Put your back into it

189
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:44,307
- Come on
- Put your back into the beat

190
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:45,975
Achieve the goals
in which you seek

191
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:47,727
Don't let nobody
steer you wrong

192
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:49,604
Or you'll be singin'
that same old song

193
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,939
- How someone's always holdin you down
- There she is.

194
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,649
- Just keep your two feet on the ground
- Girl, you didn't get enough yesterday?

195
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:56,486
And when you come you be direct
'cause punks get no respect

196
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:59,155
- My eyes to the west side
- East side, west side

197
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:12,335
How you doin'? Yeah.

198
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:21,177
Hey, everybody, everybody, look!
A cowboy!

199
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,931
Put your back into it
Put your back into it

200
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:29,894
- Put your back into it
- Don't talk about-- Don't talk
about yourself like that.

201
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:33,356
"I am a--"

202
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:37,318
- Shut up! Y'all sound
like them fifth-graders!
- You shut up!

203
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:43,991
"Does... anyone...

204
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,660
know--"

205
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,083
- What's "karate"?
- Karate, you stupid asshole.

206
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,462
- You're so stupid.
- You're a Marine? A for-real Marine?

207
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:59,757
- Discharged, but yes.
- Estupido.

208
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:02,760
I'll try some karate
with you, Miss Johnson.

209
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:09,892
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed
to touch a student.

210
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:13,396
But if you really think you know
what you're doin', come on up here.

211
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,566
Hey, sounds like a challenge to me,
ése. You'd better get up there.

212
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:20,737
Oh, I know what I'm doin'.
There's no sense doin' it though
if you can't touch me.

213
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:25,950
Okay, anybody else know
any karate? What about you?

214
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:29,454
- Durrell Chang Chang.
- I know some motherfuckin' karate.

215
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:33,332
Whoo! Durrell, gimme it!

216
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,334
- Durrell.
- Shit.

217
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:43,050
- What about you? You know any karate?
- Raul. Yeah, I know enough.

218
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,136
- Okay, Raul.
- Go on up there.

219
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:47,513
Come on up here.

220
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:50,183
- All right. Yeah, shit. I'm
gonna take that motherfucker.
- Come on, Nacho.

221
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,060
Shit. All right.
Come on, let's go, ése.

222
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:54,729
Let's go.

223
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:07,700
Shit!

224
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,078
You guys--
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

225
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,414
You guys don't know shit.

226
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,125
-"l don't know shit," man.
I know what I'm doin', lady.
-You don't even know any throws.

227
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:21,798
Now, I heard that a Marine
can kill a man with his, uh,
bare hands. ls that true?

228
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,092
Absolutely.

229
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:27,261
Oh, shit.

230
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,643
Okay, h-here's how it starts.

231
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,396
Um, okay, where's a-- Can you two move
that desk down there a little bit?

232
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:44,445
Um, okay, everything is
slow motion at first.

233
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:47,281
- Um, Durrell.
- Yeah.

234
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:51,327
Okay, you, um, you move into
Raul like you're gonna hit him.

235
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:53,371
Yeah, I can do that.

236
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:54,789
- Okay.
- Nacho.

237
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:59,001
Now, Raul, you're gonna
step into Durrell...

238
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:01,921
and you're gonna
grab his wrist, okay?

239
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:08,136
You're gonna turn your body
away from him so that your butt
is in his stomach. Okay?

240
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:11,472
Fuck you!
Get the fuck off me, man!

241
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,308
What you gonna do?

242
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,811
- Man, you wish, homes! You wish, man!
- Bring it on, homes!

243
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,397
- Fuck you! Get your hands off me!
- Bring it on, Nacho.
- You wish, man!

244
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:23,109
- Bring it on.
- Now, it's a hip throw.
lt's a hip throw.

245
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,779
- Okay, take your fighting
stance again, okay.
- Nacho.

246
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,031
Okay, grab his wrist.
Okay.

247
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,325
Now, now this time,
as you move in,

248
00:17:31,492 --> 00:17:34,996
you're gonna take this hand,
you're gonna grab onto this shoulder.

249
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:36,998
Okay? Ready?

250
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,209
Oh, shit!

251
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:44,213
Thank you! Hey! Hey!
All right!

252
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:47,508
- Ow, man! I'll kick your
motherfuckin' ass, ése!
- Sucker! Sucker!

253
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:58,227
Well, that was "A" work.

254
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,229
You'd make good Marines.

255
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,942
ln fact, from this moment,

256
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:07,695
each one of you
is like an inductee...

257
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:11,115
- Who's a duck?
- with a clean record.
- Quack.

258
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:16,287
- So, if you wanna pass,
- Quack quack.

259
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:18,289
all you have to do is try.

260
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,295
Oh, homes.

261
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:29,842
Because at this point,
everyone has an "A."

262
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,428
- What?
- ls she serious?

263
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,936
But it's up to you to keep it.

264
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:45,399
-Bullshit.
-Yo, why don't you shut up, man.

265
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:49,070
What if it ain't bullshit? Ain't
never had no fuckin' "A" before.

266
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,282
I once knew a man
who couldn't read

267
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:55,368
He said it ain't no thang
'cause I graduated twice

268
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,744
With the game I possess

269
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:58,287
Bulletproof vest
to the chest

270
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:00,790
But when his kids needed help
to prepare for a test

271
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:03,751
lt was stress 'cause Pops
didn't achieve any academics

272
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:06,129
And true, indeed
This problem is an epidemic

273
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,549
Who want to work five long hard days
through it and get taxed

274
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:11,134
So that's a message
for your mind

275
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:14,720
The story's been told
about a thousand times

276
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,431
So here's a message
for your mind

277
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,725
One thousand-one
One thousand-two

278
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:21,644
So here's a message
for your mind

279
00:19:29,277 --> 00:19:31,154
Morning.

280
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,245
- Okay, today we are going
to conjugate some verbs.
- What?

281
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,414
Hey, what about karate?

282
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,500
Well, I can't just teach you karate.
I'll show you another hold next week.

283
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,336
Get outta here!

284
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:57,638
Belt it out, too.
I wanna hear it.

285
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:09,525
We eat green beans for dinner.
What you do with 'em?

286
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,736
"We eat green beans for dinner."

287
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,656
- Okay--
- Hey, Pam. Pam!

288
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,661
Ye-- Yo, Chris!

289
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,297
Hey. Hey. Hey, what's up?

290
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,348
Hey, man, it's not
a big deal, okay?

291
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,523
ls that true?

292
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:51,442
lf we wanna die?
Shit, no.

293
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:54,904
We want you to die.

294
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:59,367
- ls that true?
- Well, if it was between
you and us, hell yeah.

295
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,453
- Okay.
- Hey! Hey! I don't care
if I live or die!

296
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,375
- What about that?
- Suicide, man.
- What's all this bullshit with dying?

297
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,546
- You want us dead?
- No, darlin', but I do
want you to keep your "A."

298
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:13,548
So, no, I'm gonna make it
real easy on you, okay?

299
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:18,928
All you have to do is tell me the verb
that makes this sentence true.

300
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:22,056
We choose to do some karate.

301
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,976
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, give me a verb
instead of "choose."

302
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,812
- We're going to die?
- We must die, okay.

303
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:32,567
- Okay, "we must die." ls "must"
a verb? Can you, uh--
- No, "must" ain't no verb.

304
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:37,238
- Can you "must" something?
- Yeah. I must piss right now.
You'd better believe it.

305
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:47,915
Okay, what verb that we used
today is the most powerful?

306
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:50,668
- Die.
- Piss.

307
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:53,087
Oh, you so stupid!

308
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:58,050
- Choose.
- Choose.

309
00:21:58,176 --> 00:21:59,927
- What's your name?
- Callie.

310
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:02,430
Callie, why?

311
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,475
Because that's the difference between
owning your life and being afraid.

312
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,268
Saying "l choose"
no matter what.

313
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:09,270
You mean, like a guy's got
a gun to your head...

314
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:12,106
and he's pulling the trigger
and you say, "l choose to die"?

315
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,153
No, you ain't choosin' to die,
but you can choose to die
without screaming, right?

316
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,447
I mean, you could always
choose somethin'.

317
00:22:19,614 --> 00:22:21,783
- Not where I live.
- Shit.

318
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:23,993
Did you read that somewhere
in this class?

319
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:32,794
No. ln our class we readin' this book
called My Darling, My Hamburger.

320
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,629
- From this.
- My what?

321
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:37,632
- My Darling, My Hamburger.
- Hamburger?

322
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:42,929
Possessive pronoun, noun,
possessive pronoun.

323
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:45,807
- Oh, watch it, girl.
- Let's see.

324
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,850
E-Excuse me.

325
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,811
- Excuse me, Miss Johnson.
- Uh-- Oh, yes.

326
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:53,106
Would you stop by the principaI's office
before your next class, please?

327
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,401
Mr Grandey would like
to speak to you.

328
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:59,529
The principal!

329
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:02,990
Oooh, White Bread in trouble!

330
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,888
Yes. I'll talk to you later.

331
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,474
Bye-bye.

332
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:32,478
Miss Johnson, this is an office.
We knock before we enter.

333
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,690
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,191
Please.

335
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:47,702
Now, Miss Johnson,
I'm taking into consideration
the fact that you're new...

336
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:51,873
and therefore don't know that teaching
karate is against school policy...

337
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,918
and can lead to a lawsuit
in case of an injury.

338
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:59,213
But you can avoid this kind of error--
you simply follow the curriculum...

339
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,716
dictated by
the Board of Education.

340
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:09,140
Well, um, sir, that's
almost impossible, um--

341
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:12,852
Most of my students don't
even know what a verb is.

342
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,604
lf you're going to teach them,

343
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:19,484
I'm sure there's a better sentence
than "We choose to die."

344
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,904
I'm sure there are, but I--
I-l needed a sentence that
would get their attention...

345
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:27,533
- Mmm.
- and, well, it had to
be better than this.

346
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:33,206
Miss Johnson, that is the approved
curriculum for second period.

347
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,500
Your class.

348
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:39,045
Now, I know the newer the teacher,
the smarter she is,

349
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:44,675
but I-I'm afraid you're just
going to have to go along
with our policies,

350
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:47,678
even if you don't
agree with them.

351
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,141
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,394
What a fuckin' idiot.

353
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:02,902
- Griffith.
- Don't let them get to you.

354
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:06,197
I'm not. I-ln fact, I'm about to
challenge the entire curriculum.

355
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:11,619
- lf I could just find the paper
in the Xerox room.
- You can't. There isn't any.

356
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,288
- What do you mean?
- I mean there isn't any.

357
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:18,584
I mean, we're out of Xerox paper and art
paper and we're short on pencils.

358
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:22,630
But we do have plenty of students.
I guess that, uh, balances things out.

359
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:26,801
Thanks.

360
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:36,727
Another fuckin' idiot.

361
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:39,772
No, I can't run, I can't hide
from all this pressure

362
00:25:39,897 --> 00:25:42,984
lf I sell out, that means
I'm coppin' to a lesser charge

363
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,070
- And whenever there's a will
baby, there's a way
- Shit!

364
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:49,115
Each one teach one I always say
the murder rate is risin'

365
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:53,327
Society ain't scarin' me
Life is like a puzzle
Ain't no tellin' when they'll bury me

366
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:57,290
- Problems, problems
How are we gonna solve 'em
- So, what's on today's lesson plan?

367
00:25:57,415 --> 00:26:01,335
A little kickboxing?
Some, uh, target practice, huh?

368
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:04,505
No. My own little
secret weapon.

369
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,425
Problems, problems
How are we gonna solve 'em

370
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,682
Okay, so, "never" is--

371
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,976
- lt's a verb!
- Adverb! Adverb!
- Adverb! Adverb!

372
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,228
Adverb! Fantastic!

373
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:21,689
- Whoo!
- You guys'll be reading poetry soon.

374
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:24,233
- You guys are sharp.
- Oh, my--

375
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,069
- Whoa!
- Okay.

376
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,323
- Homeboy!
- King of the calle!

377
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,700
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

378
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:38,581
- Sit down.
- Honourable sensei. Hmm.

379
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:42,543
lt's obvious that "homeboy"
is a noun.

380
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,714
Noun is correct!

381
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,634
Well, give me my damn candy bar.

382
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,177
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

383
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,555
Boy, poetry will be a piece
of cake for this crowd.

384
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:58,768
Yo, how come you keep sayin' poetry?
What's poetry got to do with this shit?

385
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:01,604
Poetry? WelI--

386
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:04,565
Because if you can read poetry,
you can read just about anything, hon.

387
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:08,319
- When you're ready for poetry,
you're ready for bear.
- I say bring on the bear!

388
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:11,781
- I'm always ready for bear. Shit.
- I'm always ready to see you bare.

389
00:27:11,948 --> 00:27:15,993
- Whoa!
- Oh, shut up, you stupid!
- Oh, yeah? Ohh! Ohh!

390
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:20,206
Well, okay, here's the bear.

391
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:23,376
So what the fuck is that?

392
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:29,298
- I just happen to have copies
of-of-- of a poem...
- Wait for me! Shit!

393
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:33,094
- That's okay.
- written by the greatest poet.

394
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,263
My Darling, My Hamburger.
How's that?

395
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,809
- Okay, here's the deal.
- She was joking about the bear.

396
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:44,188
When we finish this assignment,
I am gonna take...

397
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:46,065
all of you...

398
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,151
to a place that has...

399
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:51,863
the highest parachute jumps,

400
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:53,948
the biggest roller coaster,

401
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:56,075
the best rides,

402
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:58,911
the most delicious hot dogs,

403
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,663
the hardest games...

404
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,792
and the best prizes
in the world.

405
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,003
- You're kiddin'.
- For real?

406
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,047
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Huh?

407
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:13,009
- And we don't gotta pay for it?
- Not a penny.

408
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:16,137
So then, who pays?

409
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,723
The Board of Education.

410
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,975
- Lord, did you hear that?
- I don't believe it.

411
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:25,813
- Sound good?
- Hey!

412
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,109
That's bullshit, man!

413
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,404
I'm sorry?

414
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:38,326
Since when has the Board of Education
done anything for us, huh?

415
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:41,329
Yeah, man, we fuckin'
barely get lunch.

416
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,583
Well, I'm sorry you feel
that way, Emilio.

417
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:50,296
Good.

418
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:54,842
- Uh, Durrell, you wanna read
the first four lines?
- Oh, man, you trippin', man.

419
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,928
I ain't readin'. You trippin'.

420
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:02,725
- Okay, how about the f--
- You've got to read it.
- How about the first line?

421
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,230
I'm scared to death, motherfucker,
all right? That's all.

422
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:22,703
- Move slowly to the right, people.
- Yep, yep

423
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,623
Miss Johnson.

424
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:28,376
- You better be for real.
- Yep, yep

425
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:34,173
- Yep, yep
- Miss Johnson?

426
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:36,509
Yes, Callie?

427
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:39,929
lf you wanna get the class
to listen, get Emilio.

428
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,225
- Yep, yep
- lt's all right

429
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:47,353
- lt's all right
- As you may have heard

430
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,105
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one

431
00:29:49,272 --> 00:29:52,108
- To smoke a fat one
- And drink a Thunderbird

432
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:55,027
- Drink a Thunderbird
- lt's okay

433
00:29:55,153 --> 00:29:58,030
- lt's okay
- To play this loud

434
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:04,078
- Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down
- Wait

435
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:07,457
- I'll get you, you little fucker.
- Yep

436
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:10,418
- Poetry?
- Poetry, yeah.

437
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,962
- These kids?
- Why not these kids?

438
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,298
Well, hey, go for it.

439
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:18,885
No, but I gotta find a gimmick
first, you know. Something
that'll grab their attention.

440
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,095
- Who's your favourite poet, Griffith?
- My favourite?

441
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,056
- Oh, there are so many.
How do I choose?
- I'm serious.

442
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:26,893
Mmm. Serious. Okay.

443
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:29,353
- Big D. Dylan.
- Get out!

444
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,355
Why not?

445
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,900
Well, I don-- He's n-- You know,
he's not for everybody.

446
00:30:34,025 --> 00:30:36,944
I mean, he's a little
long-winded, don't you think?

447
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,280
I suppose that's 'cause
he wrote drunk.

448
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:41,199
He had a drinking problem?

449
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:43,659
Well, the guy's Welsh.
There ain't a lot to do there.

450
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:46,079
I thought he was from Minnesota.

451
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:49,373
You know, if the guy's your
favourite poet, you might want
to read up on him a little bit.

452
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,626
He was Welsh and
he drank himself to death.

453
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:54,921
Dead? He's not dead.
I saw him yesterday on MTV.

454
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,675
You saw Dylan Thomas on MTV.

455
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:02,845
No. Bob Dylan.

456
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,223
Oh--

457
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:08,476
-Bob Dylan? Ohh!
-He looked dead. He looked dead.

458
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:12,105
- Ohh!
- Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

459
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:15,358
Play a song for me

460
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:19,153
"Hey, Mr Tambourine Man--"

461
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,322
- Tambourine!
- Tambourine!
- Tangerine.

462
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,158
"T-Tambourine Man,

463
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:27,495
Play a song for me

464
00:31:27,662 --> 00:31:31,791
I'm not sleepy and there is
no place I'm going to"

465
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,584
Wow, he can read.

466
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,628
Thank you. Taiwana?

467
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,967
The next three lines, Taiwana.

468
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,261
"Hey, Mr Tambourine Man

469
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:45,721
Play a song for me

470
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:49,475
ln the jingle-jangle morning
I'll come following you"

471
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,561
- Good.
- All right.

472
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:53,521
- Yes.
- What does that mean?

473
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,023
What do you think it means?

474
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:58,109
What, some guy's
got a tambourine...

475
00:31:58,234 --> 00:32:01,654
and this other guy wants him to
play it 'cause he can't sleep.

476
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:04,449
- Okay.
- Yeah, but how come he want
to play the tambourine?

477
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:07,285
Don't he got a radio or somethin'?
You know what I'm sayin'?

478
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:12,331
Well, you kn-- That's a good point.
I mean, i-i-it's-- it's a weird choice.

479
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:16,794
So, what if I told you
that Mr Tambourine Man...

480
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,671
is a code name?

481
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:22,133
- A code name for what?
- James Bond.

482
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,802
- A drug dealer.
- ls it?

483
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,804
Well, a lot of people think so.

484
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:30,016
You know, this song is from the '60s,
when you couldn't sing about drugs,

485
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:32,268
so they had to make up codes.

486
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:37,899
So what was the code?
What does "Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me" mean?

487
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:41,069
- Well, you figure--
- "Play a song for me"
means "give me the stuff."

488
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:43,946
Yeah, it's like that nigger
been out drinkin' all night
and smokin' some shit...

489
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:46,449
and everybody broke out on his
ass, you know what I'm sayin'?

490
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:50,661
And he's high-- he's still high,
but he's kinda low and shaky.
You know-- "jingle-jangle."

491
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:54,082
Yeah, and he needs something, like
a big hit of crack or cocaine and shit.

492
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:56,250
He's crazy, okay?

493
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,378
So, what do you think, Emilio?
Do you think that Raul is right?

494
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:06,094
- All right, it's too
personal to discuss.
- What?

495
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:09,555
You mean you choose not to
participate in the discussion?

496
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,975
- Boy's too slick.
- Not about somethin' so personal.

497
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:20,441
Wanna draw for it?

498
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,610
What?

499
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:26,489
High card, you don't have to
discuss anything.

500
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:31,244
Why do I gotta draw for it?
That's the way it is now.

501
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:52,265
Listen to this.

502
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,977
Name one of the most influential
presidents of the 20th century.

503
00:33:56,144 --> 00:33:58,980
- Roosevelt.
- Simple, right?

504
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:02,608
Wrong.
A history teacher's nightmare.

505
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,154
How about Snoop Doggy Dogg
for an answer?

506
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,741
Joe Montana. Winston Churchill.

507
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:14,954
But this-- this is the best.

508
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:19,083
"l will not answer this question on the
grounds that it is culturally biased...

509
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,627
against individuals
such as myself."

510
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,049
Actually, for this answer I'm
gonna give him partial credit.

511
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,679
Louanne, you lose your
sense of humour, it's over.

512
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:35,349
Uh, here.
New pictures of the rug rats.

513
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:38,603
- Oh, God. People are supposed
to ask first, Griffith.
- Shut up.

514
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:44,025
Ohh. They look like Maggie.
Thank God.

515
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:47,695
Oh, I don't know. Harry with his thumb
in his mouth, he kinda looks like me.

516
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:50,865
ls that his thumb?
I thought that was a cigarette.

517
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,201
- How is Maggie?
- Good.

518
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:55,369
She wants you to come over
for dinner.

519
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:59,874
We had some fun times, you and Maggie
and me and-- what's his name?

520
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,628
- I remember.
- Yeah.

521
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:10,384
I remember too. That's why it's
hard for me to come to dinner.

522
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,889
- Seeing anybody?
- No.

523
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:19,227
How do you do that? You walk around
with a bag over your head?

524
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:22,146
- No.
- Louanne, it's over six months.

525
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,148
I'm not ready, Hal.

526
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:32,573
You know, I thought you guys
always stuck together. What are
you sitting here with me for?

527
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:37,703
You know, he was my best friend,
Louanne. "Was" is the operative word.

528
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:41,499
He isn't worth your spit.

529
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:52,385
What was that for?

530
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:55,972
Just tell Maggie
she's a lucky lady, Griffith.

531
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:59,767
Yeah, when they made me they
broke the mold. Both of them.

532
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:06,065
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

533
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,284
We gotta stop meeting like this.

534
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:22,749
You sound awful.

535
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,500
I refuse to take
medical advice...

536
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:29,088
from somebody who eats Cheetos
at 8:00 in the morning.

537
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:33,134
Yeah, well, you shouldn't smoke.
Listen to that cough!

538
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:36,304
You know--

539
00:36:38,514 --> 00:36:40,975
- I'll see you inside.
- You're gonna finish
the cigarette, aren't you?

540
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:44,687
No, I'm not. Really.
Honest. I swear.

541
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:48,149
Here! Right here! Yeah!

542
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:01,871
- Guys are off playin' pool.
- You wanna smoke a cigarette?

543
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:04,707
- I gave you your money, man. 350 bucks!
- Three-fifty?

544
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,959
What are you talkin' about, homes?
Are you callin' me a liar?

545
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:10,505
- What, do you think I'm fuckin' stupid?
- Yo, man, no.
Don't get loud, motherfucker!

546
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,382
I'm gonna kick your fuckin'
spic ass!

547
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:16,219
- Fuck you, man!
- Jump back, motherfucker!
- Fight! Fight!

548
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:19,472
- Get back, get back.
- You fuckin' pendejo!
- Okay, okay, okay!

549
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:22,350
Back off! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

550
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,727
- iPuto!
- One of you makes a move,
I will call security!

551
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,563
- Aw, bullshit!
- Big fuckin' deal.
- They don't care.

552
00:37:27,688 --> 00:37:32,360
Okay, get to your classes.
Okay. lt's all over. Move!

553
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,035
-You are stronger than these two
put together, and you know it!
-Bullshit, man!

554
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:42,578
- iVato!
- He wishes, man!

555
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:51,003
You could all be expelled if I report
this to the office, and you know that.

556
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:55,758
Okay, if you give me your word that
it ends here, I'll forget it.

557
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:58,511
ls it over?

558
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:01,556
Yeah.

559
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,558
How about you?

560
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:06,727
- Yeah, simón.
- Absolutely.

561
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:13,901
Okay, I trust you.
Now get to your classes.

562
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:17,947
See you later, puto.

563
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,199
Catch you later, ése.

564
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:30,710
lf you hit those kids,
you'll pay for it. I swear.

565
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:41,012
Get to your class
and behave yourself.

566
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,184
You shouldn't have done that.

567
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:50,271
- Oh? Why not?
- 'Cause you just shouldn't
mess with Emilio.

568
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:53,816
Raul knows that if you make a deal
with Emilio and you fuck up on him,

569
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,818
you get your locker smashed in
with your head.

570
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:58,446
Everybody knows that.

571
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:00,948
Well, maybe they'll all have
time to think about it...

572
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,784
before they get to
the locker-smashing stage.

573
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,912
They're gonna fight,
no matter what they tell you.

574
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:09,957
What do you mean?

575
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:12,627
When? Now?

576
00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:17,465
Where? Angela! Where?

577
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,137
- Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
- Get him!

578
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,639
Keep fightin'!
Keep kickin' his ass!

579
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:29,310
Shit! Fuck!

580
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:32,772
Ohh!

581
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:39,862
Oh, shit.

582
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,451
- Come on! Fuckin' come on!
- Fuck that!

583
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:46,953
Shit!

584
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:52,834
Come on, break it up!
Break it up!

585
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,170
- Get the fuck off me!
- Get outta there!
- iPuto! You motherfucker!

586
00:39:56,295 --> 00:40:00,550
Get back! Now!
Get back! Get back!

587
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:03,010
All of you! Comin' through!

588
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:09,517
- Watch your head.
- Kickin', man.

589
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:13,020
No. Wait a minute. Wait. No, no.
Gimme-- G-- Just give me a minute.

590
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:18,568
- You promised!
- Yeah, but we had to,

591
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:21,529
or we couldn't walk around
with our heads up no more.

592
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:25,241
We got a reputation to protect.
You a Marine. You understand.

593
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,493
Like, if America didn't stand up
everyone would attack it.

594
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:30,705
Well, in our neighbourhood if you don't
stand up you can't walk down the street,

595
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,999
'cause everyone will attack you,
you know?

596
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:37,670
Rata, you fuckin' puto.

597
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:41,048
- Man, I cracked that
motherfucker's head, ése.
- See you in the fuckin

598
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,637
Okay, I see.

599
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:52,059
And I made it worse and I made you and
Gusmaro look bad in front of everyone...

600
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:54,395
by saying that Emilio was
stronger than the both of you.

601
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:57,064
Yeah, well, you thought
you was helpin' us.

602
00:40:57,231 --> 00:41:00,651
Ma'am, I'm sorry. We really have to go.
I gotta get 'em home.

603
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,071
Nasty cut.

604
00:41:50,326 --> 00:41:53,037
You mind telling me what the fight
was about in the first place?

605
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,831
Yeah.

606
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:02,588
I really would like to know
what happened. I'm not gonna
make any trouble for you.

607
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:05,925
- I just wanna know, was it worth it?
- Yeah, it was worth it.

608
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,095
- Why?
- Because it felt good
hittin' him in the face.

609
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,306
- I got him good, man.
- Yeah, you like to hit people?

610
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:14,308
Yeah, I like to hit people.

611
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:19,313
Why?

612
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,024
You feel angry
a lot of the time?

613
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:25,069
So now you're gonna
try and psychologize me?

614
00:42:25,236 --> 00:42:28,823
You're gonna try and figure
me out? I'll help you.

615
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,993
I come from a broken home,
and we're poor. Okay?

616
00:42:33,494 --> 00:42:36,330
I see the same fuckin' movies
you do, man.

617
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,462
I would like to help you,
Emilio.

618
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:46,674
Thank you very much. And how
would you like to do that?

619
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:50,011
You gonna give me some good
advice? "Just say no"?

620
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:53,514
You gonna get me off
the streets? Well, forget it!

621
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,726
How the fuck you gonna
save me from my life, huh?

622
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:05,568
Yep, yep

623
00:43:06,694 --> 00:43:08,571
Karen?

624
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:11,783
I have three, uh,
student files here...

625
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:15,161
- and I can't find a phone
number in any of 'em.
- Yep, yep

626
00:43:15,328 --> 00:43:17,538
Well, sometimes they don't
give a number...

627
00:43:17,663 --> 00:43:20,124
- and sometimes
they don't have a phone.
- Yep, yep

628
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:24,253
- lt's all right
- lt's all right
- As you might have heard

629
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:27,381
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one
- To smoke a fat one

630
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:30,218
- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird

631
00:43:30,384 --> 00:43:32,553
- lt's okay
- lt's okay

632
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:35,556
- To play this loud
- Oh, play it loud

633
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:40,645
Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down

634
00:43:40,812 --> 00:43:42,897
- lt's all right
- lt's all right

635
00:43:43,022 --> 00:43:45,441
- As you may have heard
- Yeah

636
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:48,152
- To smoke a fat one
- Smoke a fat one

637
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:53,074
- And drink a 'Bird
- A Thunderbird, now

638
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:57,578
lt's okay

639
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:07,338
Come on. Come on.

640
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:10,341
Do your homework.

641
00:44:31,446 --> 00:44:35,283
- You have a lovely family,
Mrs. Sanchero.
- Thank you.

642
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:42,790
We know why you're here,
Miss Johnson.

643
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,336
I warned Raul to
stay out of trouble.

644
00:44:47,503 --> 00:44:50,798
He's first in our family to
maybe graduate high school.

645
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:54,010
- So he gonna get punished big
for what he done.
- N--

646
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:57,597
Don't you worry about that.

647
00:44:57,722 --> 00:45:00,600
But he didn't do anything wrong.

648
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,479
-But he expelled for three days.
-l know. No, I know.

649
00:45:04,645 --> 00:45:09,275
But he didn't start the fight. He was
defending himself from a bigger boy.

650
00:45:09,442 --> 00:45:11,986
He was protecting himself.

651
00:45:12,153 --> 00:45:14,906
- Uh, why they send him home?
- lt's just school policy.

652
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:18,326
I-I-lt gives the other boy
time to cool down.

653
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:20,912
Actually,

654
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:25,291
I'm here because I just wanted
to tell you both personally...

655
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:29,378
what a pleasure it's been having
Raul in my class this semester.

656
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:31,923
You must be very proud.

657
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:36,844
Yes.

658
00:45:37,011 --> 00:45:39,972
He's, um--
Well, he's very bright...

659
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:43,518
and funny, articulate.

660
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:48,648
The truth is, he's--
he's one of my favourites.

661
00:46:31,774 --> 00:46:34,152
Uh, soy Louanne Johnson.

662
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,076
Oh.

663
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:47,248
"l will not go down underground

664
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:50,084
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

665
00:46:51,335 --> 00:46:53,713
Okay, this is another
Dylan poem.

666
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,050
Now, is that a code, or does
that just mean what it says?

667
00:47:06,768 --> 00:47:08,811
"And I will not carry myself
down to die

668
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:11,105
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

669
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,691
"My head will be high."
What does that mean?

670
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:17,862
Anybody.

671
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:23,951
Nobody.

672
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:26,454
ls there something
I should know?

673
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:29,624
Yeah. I'll tell you.

674
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,461
You ratted on Raul,
Gusmaro and Emilio.

675
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:36,130
Yeah. You got Emilio
put into detention.

676
00:47:36,255 --> 00:47:38,299
lt wasn't none of your
business, chismosa.

677
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:40,635
And you got Raul
and Gusmaro suspended.

678
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,054
- Now they're gonna get
their fuckin' asses kicked.
- And you got Emilio--

679
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:45,348
- Hey, I didn't rat on anybody.
- Wasn't none of your business
anyway, you chismosa.

680
00:47:45,473 --> 00:47:48,726
- Bullshit.
- Let this--
- Told you she was full of shit.

681
00:47:48,893 --> 00:47:52,897
- Snitches get stitches, bitch.
- Do you wanna talk about this?

682
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:56,484
On you, shit. Whatever
floats your boat, teach.

683
00:47:56,609 --> 00:47:58,861
We don't have no choices
in this room.

684
00:47:59,028 --> 00:48:01,697
Well, if you all feel that strongly
about it, leave the room.

685
00:48:01,823 --> 00:48:04,033
- What?
- Hey, listen.

686
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,914
Nobody's forcing you to be here.
You have a choice.
You can stay, or you can leave.

687
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,000
Lady, why are you playin' this
game? We don't have a choice.

688
00:48:13,126 --> 00:48:16,504
You don't have a choice? You don't have
a choice on whether or not you're here?

689
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:20,007
No. lf we leave, we don't
get to graduate. lf we stay,
we gotta put up with you.

690
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:22,218
Well, that's a choice, isn't it?
You have a choice.

691
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:24,470
You either don't graduate
or you have to put up with me.

692
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:27,348
lt may not be a choice you like,
but it is a choice.

693
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:30,643
Man, you don't understand nothin'. l
mean, you don't come from where we live.

694
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,689
- You-- You're not bussed here.
- Do you have a choice
to get on that bus?

695
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:37,191
Man, you come and live in my
neighbourhood for one week...

696
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,652
and then you tell me
if you got a choice.

697
00:48:39,777 --> 00:48:44,198
There are a lot of people who
live in your neighbourhood who
choose not to get on that bus.

698
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:47,076
What do they choose to do?
They choose to go out and sell drugs.

699
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,496
They choose to go out and kill people.
They choose to do a lot of other things.

700
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:52,874
But they choose not to
get on that bus.

701
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,253
The people who choose to get on
that bus, which are you,
are the people who are saying,

702
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,714
"l will not carry myself
down to die

703
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:02,675
When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

704
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,011
That is a choice.

705
00:49:05,178 --> 00:49:07,513
There are no victims
in this classroom!

706
00:49:12,894 --> 00:49:15,021
Why do you care anyway?
You just here for the money.

707
00:49:15,146 --> 00:49:17,732
Because I make a choice to care.
And, honey, the money ain't that good.

708
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:20,234
- Whatever.
- Read it again, Miss Johnson.

709
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:24,238
- What?
- Read those lines you just read again.

710
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:40,505
"l will not go down underground

711
00:49:40,671 --> 00:49:44,550
'Cause somebody tells me
that death's comin' 'round"

712
00:49:48,888 --> 00:49:51,140
Does that mean
just what it says?

713
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,437
No, it don't mean
just what it says.

714
00:49:56,604 --> 00:49:59,107
Because...

715
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:01,609
you wouldn't go
under the ground...

716
00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:05,488
if someone told you
death was comin'.

717
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:09,200
But you would go into the ground
if you were already dead.

718
00:50:16,624 --> 00:50:19,961
Do the rest of you
agree with that?

719
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:29,345
Well, I kinda agree with it,

720
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:33,391
but I think
it just means that...

721
00:50:33,516 --> 00:50:35,268
he ain't gonna help death out,
you know?

722
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:38,104
lt's not like he's just gonna
lay down and wait for it.

723
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:42,817
I think he's gonna choose-- No,
I think he's gonna make the choice--

724
00:50:42,942 --> 00:50:44,819
to die hard.

725
00:50:47,113 --> 00:50:48,948
Mm-hmm.

726
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:51,451
- Yeah, I agree with that.
- Yeah, me too.

727
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:53,494
- That's what it sounds like to me.
- Okay.

728
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:57,206
Well, what about, uh,
the rest of it? Um--

729
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,333
"When I go to my grave
My head will be high"

730
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:02,170
"Head will be high."
What does that mean?

731
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:06,174
- You're gonna die with pride.
- Right.

732
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:08,843
- See you tomorrow.
- Callie, wait up!

733
00:51:30,323 --> 00:51:34,410
You went to RauI's house last
night, and Gusmaro's too, right?

734
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:37,121
Mm-hmm.

735
00:51:37,288 --> 00:51:39,457
Yeah, that's what they told me.

736
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,211
That's cool.

737
00:51:55,014 --> 00:51:58,267
Hold up, wait a minute
Don't go there 'cause I ain't with it

738
00:51:58,392 --> 00:52:01,687
Hold up, wait a minute
Don't go there 'cause I ain't with it

739
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:09,487
What you want
Baby, I got it

740
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:12,740
What you need
Babe, you got it

741
00:52:12,907 --> 00:52:15,993
All I'm askin'
is for a little respect

742
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:21,457
Yo, kick it, homes!
What you waitin' for, man?

743
00:52:21,624 --> 00:52:24,752
- Are you trying to steal my $2.50, ése?
- Ah, go, go, go.

744
00:52:24,919 --> 00:52:29,173
Man, that ain't shit.
Go faster, man. Go faster, man.

745
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:38,057
- Come on, come on
- Faster, man, faster!
- You got to gimme, gimme

746
00:52:38,224 --> 00:52:41,561
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- I got to get it, get it

747
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:44,981
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- You got to gimme, gimme

748
00:52:45,148 --> 00:52:48,401
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- I got to get it, get it

749
00:52:48,526 --> 00:52:50,236
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Come on, get back.

750
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:53,448
Are you all right, man? That looked
like a real bitch right then.

751
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:57,577
Hey, get the fuck
out of there, man. Look at you!
You look like my grandma, man.

752
00:53:00,455 --> 00:53:02,999
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T
- Miss Johnson,

753
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:06,210
the-- the School Board would have every
right to insist on your dismissal.

754
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:09,505
You informed no one.
You got no permission slips.

755
00:53:09,672 --> 00:53:14,093
Oh, but there was no one to inform.
All the kids just decided to go to
the amusement park at the last minute.

756
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,929
And then they let me come along.

757
00:53:17,054 --> 00:53:20,224
- Did they pay for you?
- No, I paid for them.

758
00:53:23,102 --> 00:53:26,898
I was just so moved
by the invitation.

759
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:33,112
This wasn't, by any chance,

760
00:53:33,237 --> 00:53:37,867
their reward for reading
poetry, was it, Miss Johnson?

761
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:42,705
ln my class, Mr Grandey,
poetry is its own reward.

762
00:53:47,877 --> 00:53:50,713
Angela, would you read
the first line?

763
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,218
"Appetizers. Freshly cut bay shrimp
grilled to perfection."

764
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:58,971
- This is a Xerox of a menu.
- That is correct.

765
00:53:59,138 --> 00:54:03,142
lt's from The Flowering Peach,
the best restaurant in town.

766
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:06,395
- Ever hear of it?
- Yeah, we heard of it.

767
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:08,815
lt's supposed to be like
some special restaurant or somethin'.

768
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:11,150
Mm-hmm.
So, does it sound good?

769
00:54:13,027 --> 00:54:17,490
Because whoever wins the, uh,
the-- the Dylan-Dylan contest...

770
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:19,992
- The what?
- goes there for dinner with me.

771
00:54:20,118 --> 00:54:23,079
Hey, what's the Dylan-Dylan
contest about?

772
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:25,081
Well.

773
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:30,294
There's Bob Dylan,

774
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:33,005
who we've been reading.

775
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:35,007
And then...

776
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:39,512
there's Dylan Thomas,

777
00:54:39,637 --> 00:54:41,347
who also wrote poems.

778
00:54:41,514 --> 00:54:44,976
lf you can find the poem
written by Dylan Thomas...

779
00:54:45,143 --> 00:54:50,022
that is like a poem
written by Bob Dylan,

780
00:54:50,189 --> 00:54:52,442
you win the Dylan-Dylan contest.

781
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:57,363
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me

782
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:03,536
I'm not sleepy and there
is no place I'm going to

783
00:55:03,703 --> 00:55:08,791
Hey, Mr Tambourine Man
Play a song for me

784
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,377
ln the jingle-jangle morning

785
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:15,047
I'll come following you

786
00:55:27,185 --> 00:55:32,273
Yo, every fuckin' poem Dylan Thomas
wrote is about death, man.

787
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,650
Now, how we supposed to know
which one to write?

788
00:55:34,776 --> 00:55:38,154
"The sniper laid him low,
and strewed his brains.

789
00:55:38,321 --> 00:55:40,364
One would not think
the greenness of this valley...

790
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,492
could let a day be sick
with so much blood."

791
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:45,953
Man, that's some Rambo-Schwarzenegger
bullshit you found.

792
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,955
- That's how it's supposed to be, right?
- No.

793
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:50,333
- There's supposed to be killing shit.
- But it-- But it don't--

794
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:53,211
But it don't even mean the same as
"l will not go under the ground."

795
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:57,590
Now you're some sort of
poetic critic, now, right?

796
00:55:57,715 --> 00:55:59,926
- Oh, well, it don't.
- Thank you.

797
00:56:00,093 --> 00:56:02,637
Okay. Listen to this.

798
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:07,600
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

799
00:56:07,725 --> 00:56:11,312
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day.

800
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:15,441
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light."

801
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,986
Where's the code?
Where's the death?

802
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:21,781
Night. All that stuff
about night. That's death.

803
00:56:23,366 --> 00:56:25,451
So it's "Don't go gentle
into that good death."

804
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:29,122
Yeah, but I think "good"
is sarcastic.

805
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:33,459
When he say, "Do not go gentle,"
that's like sayin', "Don't go easy."

806
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:37,171
- So it's the same as
"l will not go down."
- We just won us

807
00:56:37,296 --> 00:56:39,715
Shh.

808
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:42,718
This is the life

809
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:46,889
Everyone has to be somewhere

810
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,562
Oh

811
00:56:52,728 --> 00:56:57,734
I am here

812
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:07,243
This is the life

813
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,372
This is the life

814
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:16,711
- This is my
- Well, the results of the
Dylan-Dylan contest are in.

815
00:57:16,878 --> 00:57:18,838
- Life
- The winners are--

816
00:57:18,963 --> 00:57:22,842
- That's me. Right here.
- Sit down. I am Bob Dylan. Sit down.

817
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:25,970
- Yo, shh! Shh!
- Sorry, Miss Johnson.

818
00:57:26,137 --> 00:57:28,431
- Shh.
- Shh.

819
00:57:30,266 --> 00:57:33,102
Raul, Durrell and Callie!

820
00:57:38,232 --> 00:57:40,193
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

821
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:43,446
- Here's your certificate.
- Hey!
- Congratulations.

822
00:57:44,655 --> 00:57:46,532
Congratulations, Callie.

823
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:49,077
Okay!

824
00:57:49,202 --> 00:57:52,038
But there are no losers in this class.
You guys did great.

825
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:54,499
You all get to pick a prize
from the box.

826
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:57,877
How come they get a prize
when they got the wrong answer?

827
00:57:58,044 --> 00:58:01,547
Well, because sometimes
it takes a lot of wrong answers
to get to the right one.

828
00:58:01,714 --> 00:58:04,967
Hey, everyone can't be right,
'cept for us!

829
00:58:07,512 --> 00:58:09,430
Come on up.

830
00:58:17,647 --> 00:58:20,024
- Miss Johnson?
- Hey, Callie.

831
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:23,861
- Um, I wanted to talk to you
about the restaurant.
- Uh-huh.

832
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:26,406
- I can't go.
- Why?

833
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:29,492
Because I have to work at this
supermarket every night until
June and I already told them--

834
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:31,494
Oh, isn't there any way
to get out of it?

835
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:35,206
No. Because of the schedule
and everything, I have to do it.

836
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:39,252
- But thank you anyway.
- Well, o-okay. Well.

837
00:58:39,377 --> 00:58:41,921
Shoot.

838
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:46,592
Well, no, it's okay. lf you
can't come to dinner, then, uh,
well, we'll bring dinner to you.

839
00:58:46,717 --> 00:58:50,346
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

840
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:53,349
- Thank you.
- I'm taking orders, Miss Roberts.

841
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:04,777
I couldn't find
a parking space.

842
00:59:04,902 --> 00:59:06,779
lt's okay.
I just got here myself.

843
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:09,449
- Oh, you look very handsome.
- How 'bout this jacket?

844
00:59:09,574 --> 00:59:11,451
lt's fantastic.

845
00:59:11,576 --> 00:59:13,578
Go ahead, touch it.
lt's real leather.

846
00:59:13,703 --> 00:59:16,456
- Ooh!
- Hey, where's Callie?

847
00:59:16,622 --> 00:59:18,833
Oh, she had to work.
Where's Durrell?

848
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:22,545
- Oh, he had to work too.
- Oh.

849
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,299
Well, I guess it's just
you and me, handsome.

850
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:28,301
I guess so.

851
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:32,221
Oh. Ladies first.

852
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:34,223
Thank you.

853
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:44,066
- Hey, are you sure they got chicken?
- Mm-hmm.

854
00:59:48,404 --> 00:59:51,282
May I tell you a little
about this evening's specials?

855
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:56,829
The chef is featuring foie gras
with smoked duck and figs
on a hill of bulgar.

856
00:59:56,954 --> 01:00:00,416
Uh, salmon tartar
in potato gaufrette...

857
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:03,377
over wild mushrooms,
and fennel salad.

858
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:05,755
Uh, for the entree
we're featuring...

859
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,675
a complex shellfish
pan roast with orso,

860
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:13,638
a touch of comfit and a broth
thickened with lobster shell oil.

861
01:00:13,763 --> 01:00:16,724
All very, very good.

862
01:00:19,393 --> 01:00:21,562
- Could we have a few minutes, please?
- Ah, yes.

863
01:00:21,729 --> 01:00:24,023
Thank you.

864
01:00:24,148 --> 01:00:26,359
- Are you sure they got chicken?
- Yes.

865
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:29,362
Here. See, it's right there,
sweetie. You see? Poulet.

866
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:34,784
And when the waiter comes back,
you may as well talk to him.

867
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:38,204
lt'll be good practice
for your summer job interviews.

868
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:41,040
I can't talk to that guy. He probably
thinks I'm weird or something.

869
01:00:41,165 --> 01:00:45,545
He does not. He can't help
but notice your natural charm.

870
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:49,507
You just look him straight
in the eye and you talk to him
like you would anyone else.

871
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:52,427
Now, go ahead and call him over.

872
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:59,308
Go ahead. Just give him
a little nod.

873
01:01:05,022 --> 01:01:08,526
- Are we ready?
- Okay, I'll have the chicken.

874
01:01:10,653 --> 01:01:12,530
A whole one.

875
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:17,952
And I'll have the same.

876
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:20,997
And one to go, please.

877
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:24,292
One to go. Thank you.

878
01:01:41,684 --> 01:01:43,311
Hey, Miss J?

879
01:01:43,436 --> 01:01:48,399
I was wondering maybe, like,
in the next couple of days, if I--

880
01:01:48,524 --> 01:01:52,070
- ls everything all right?
- Everything's fine. Thank you.

881
01:01:52,195 --> 01:01:54,280
All right.

882
01:01:54,405 --> 01:01:56,783
Now don't be mad or nothing,
but I gotta be absent...

883
01:01:56,908 --> 01:01:59,535
for a couple of days
without your coming to my house.

884
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,455
lt's important.

885
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:06,125
- You'll have to tell me why.
- I got some shit to do.

886
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:12,131
I gotta make some money
to pay back this guy.

887
01:02:16,594 --> 01:02:19,263
This doesn't sound important
enough to cut school.

888
01:02:19,347 --> 01:02:22,183
lt is. I gotta pay
for this jacket.

889
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,644
See, I got it off the street
from this guy for 200 dollars,

890
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:26,646
and he said he'd trust me
for it until Friday.

891
01:02:26,771 --> 01:02:29,816
Why did you buy it on the street
instead of in a store?

892
01:02:29,982 --> 01:02:32,902
Are you crazy? You know how much
this would cost in a store?

893
01:02:33,027 --> 01:02:37,073
I needed a nice jacket and fast,
and I got it from this guy
'cause he cut me a deal...

894
01:02:37,198 --> 01:02:41,702
'cause he stole it,
probably.

895
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:46,541
So, are you gonna go out and get
a job or are you gonna go out
and steal too to pay him back?

896
01:02:46,707 --> 01:02:49,168
Miss J, I gotta pay him back.

897
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:51,504
He'll kill me.

898
01:02:52,672 --> 01:02:54,632
I didn't have nothing to wear!

899
01:03:04,058 --> 01:03:07,228
Fine. I'll lend it to you.

900
01:03:09,439 --> 01:03:11,983
I can't take your money.
Teachers are poor. Everyone knows that.

901
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:16,070
Well, you don't really
have a choice, do you?

902
01:03:16,195 --> 01:03:18,614
lf you don't pay the guy back,
he'll kill you.

903
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:22,535
lf you cut school, I'll tell
your father and he'll kill you.

904
01:03:22,702 --> 01:03:27,290
- So I'm your only way out.
- Oh, man.

905
01:03:27,457 --> 01:03:30,668
- But I do have one condition.
- Big?

906
01:03:30,793 --> 01:03:32,837
- Huge.
- What do you want, interest?

907
01:03:32,962 --> 01:03:36,257
- Mm-mmm. Bigger.
- Jesus Christ, what is it?

908
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:40,303
Well.

909
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:43,556
- Would you like dessert?
- No!

910
01:03:43,723 --> 01:03:46,642
- Another glass of wine?
- Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

911
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:49,645
- Coffee, perhaps?
- Hey, man, we're talking!

912
01:03:53,399 --> 01:03:55,985
So, what's the condition?

913
01:03:58,279 --> 01:04:01,908
You have to pay me back
on the day you graduate.

914
01:04:04,327 --> 01:04:06,704
But-- But what if
I don't graduate?

915
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:10,291
Well, then you'll never
pay me back the money.

916
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,961
But I know that
if you say you will,

917
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:16,798
you'll kill yourself
keeping your word.

918
01:04:37,527 --> 01:04:40,780
Well, what do you say?

919
01:04:40,947 --> 01:04:45,118
I don't get it. Why do you
care so much if I graduate?

920
01:04:45,243 --> 01:04:47,495
Weird, isn't it?

921
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:55,294
All right, I'll pay you back.

922
01:04:59,132 --> 01:05:01,968
- You have my word.
- Hey.

923
01:05:02,093 --> 01:05:04,804
lt is a very nice jacket.

924
01:05:07,014 --> 01:05:09,475
Thank you.

925
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:30,830
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

926
01:05:30,997 --> 01:05:33,332
- How you doin'?
- Oh, good.

927
01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:36,961
I think this is the first time I ever
brought food into a supermarket.

928
01:05:37,128 --> 01:05:40,506
-Yeah, I can smell it from here.
-Yeah.
-Good. Thanks.

929
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:43,843
Well, Raul says if you don't like it,
he'll take it off your hands.

930
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:47,430
Oh, please.
Like hell he will.

931
01:05:47,597 --> 01:05:50,433
Callie, could you help load
in aisle three, please?

932
01:05:50,558 --> 01:05:55,480
Be right there. I'm telling you,
this place would fall to pieces
if it wasn't for me.

933
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:58,816
You know, Callie,

934
01:05:58,941 --> 01:06:00,818
just between you and me,

935
01:06:00,943 --> 01:06:06,199
with your scores, I think you should
consider going into Advanced English.

936
01:06:06,365 --> 01:06:10,078
- Oh, but I'm gonna be at Clearview.
You didn't know?
- No.

937
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:13,748
You didn't see my record?
I tell you.

938
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:15,750
No, I-- I didn't know.

939
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,628
- Bye now.
- Yeah.

940
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:23,674
ln the middle of a semester?
Are-- Are you moving?

941
01:06:23,758 --> 01:06:26,135
No. I'm pregnant.

942
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:29,806
And since I'm startin' to show,
they thought it was time, you know?

943
01:06:32,433 --> 01:06:37,563
- Who thought it was time?
- The school. They don't let you
stay there if you're pregnant.

944
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,150
But they told me they have this
really good programme at Clearview
for, like, teenage mothers.

945
01:06:41,317 --> 01:06:45,238
And they teach you stuff like parenting
and nutrition, all kinds of stuff.

946
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:47,907
So I thought it would
be good for me, you know?

947
01:06:48,074 --> 01:06:50,326
- Yeah.
- Aisle three.

948
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:55,456
"Degrade first the arts
if you'd mankind degrade."

949
01:06:55,581 --> 01:06:58,876
Hey, that's the spray can poem.

950
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:05,716
-Hey, hey, what's the code word?
-The code word is "great rides
and great prizes."

951
01:07:05,883 --> 01:07:08,594
I'm keeping it undercover
But comin' soon, I surmises

952
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:13,975
Does anybody know where, um,
Durrell and Lionel are today?

953
01:07:16,018 --> 01:07:19,772
- Durrell and Lionel.
- No.
- They around.

954
01:07:19,939 --> 01:07:24,110
Yeah, so what's the prize we're
gonna get for learning this poem?

955
01:07:24,235 --> 01:07:27,864
Learning is the prize.

956
01:07:27,989 --> 01:07:29,866
Yeah.

957
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:33,077
Knowing how to read something
and understand it is the prize.

958
01:07:33,202 --> 01:07:36,456
Okay? Knowing how to think
is the prize.

959
01:07:36,622 --> 01:07:39,959
- I know how to think right now.
- Okay. Well, yeah, well,
you know how to run too.

960
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:42,420
But not the way you
could run if you trained.

961
01:07:42,545 --> 01:07:45,423
You know, the mind
is like a muscle.

962
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:49,510
Okay? And if you want it to be really
powerful, you got to work it out. Okay?

963
01:07:49,677 --> 01:07:54,348
Each new fact
gives you another choice.

964
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:58,227
Each new idea builds
another muscle, okay?

965
01:07:58,352 --> 01:08:01,397
And it's those muscles that are
gonna make you really strong.

966
01:08:01,564 --> 01:08:05,568
Those are your weapons,
and in this unsafe world...

967
01:08:05,735 --> 01:08:07,945
I want to arm you.

968
01:08:08,071 --> 01:08:11,824
- And that's what these poems
are supposed to do?
- Yeah.

969
01:08:11,991 --> 01:08:14,494
Hey, try it. You're just
sittin' here anyway.

970
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,497
Look. Okay.
lf at the end of the term,

971
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:20,708
you're not faster, stronger
and smarter,

972
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:23,836
you will have lost nothing.

973
01:08:24,003 --> 01:08:27,173
But if you are,

974
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:32,261
you'll be that much tougher
to knock down.

975
01:08:32,428 --> 01:08:37,975
So what's "Hire idiots to paint
with cold light and hot shade"?

976
01:08:39,268 --> 01:08:40,978
They're being sarcastic, Raul.

977
01:08:41,104 --> 01:08:43,523
I mean, 'cause you know that light
is supposed to be warm, right?

978
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:45,775
- And shade is supposed to be what?
- Cold?

979
01:08:45,942 --> 01:08:49,779
Exactly. But if you go
and hire an idiot to do the job,
he's gonna do it backwards.

980
01:08:49,904 --> 01:08:52,156
- Hello.
- There you go.
- Hmm.

981
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:56,369
Don't make a big fuss
about this, Louanne.

982
01:08:56,536 --> 01:08:59,747
You have to help me. You have
no idea how bright this girl is.

983
01:08:59,872 --> 01:09:02,834
Yes, I do. And there's nothing
I can do about it.

984
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:06,462
Oh! That just makes me crazy!

985
01:09:06,587 --> 01:09:10,049
What right do these miserable,
self-righteous sons of bitches
from the Board of Education...

986
01:09:10,174 --> 01:09:13,261
have to make a moral judgment
on Callie Roberts?

987
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:15,471
- Do you know--
- Louanne, there are parents
in the next room.

988
01:09:15,638 --> 01:09:17,807
Look, I don't c--
I'm gonna fight this ruling.

989
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:21,686
I'm gonna write an open letter
to every newspaper condemning
the entire School Board.

990
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:24,105
- Oh, you can't do that.
- Why not?

991
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:28,109
Well, first of all, the Board
has nothing to do with it.

992
01:09:30,403 --> 01:09:34,449
We prefer that these girls go to
the mother-to-be programme at Clearview.

993
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:40,538
Oh, wait a minute.

994
01:09:40,705 --> 01:09:44,500
You mean this isn't a rule?
You mean this is your preference?

995
01:09:46,002 --> 01:09:47,920
Well, yes.

996
01:09:48,087 --> 01:09:52,216
You mean Callie Roberts is free
to go to any school she wants?

997
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:56,846
- lncluding this one?
- Unless she's absent
for more than 30 days.

998
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:59,557
And then she has to wait
until the baby's born
before she can come back here.

999
01:09:59,682 --> 01:10:05,438
But, Louanne, once these girls
have babies, very few of them
come back to school anyway.

1000
01:10:05,563 --> 01:10:08,024
I see.

1001
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:12,278
So you make them think
they have to leave.

1002
01:10:12,445 --> 01:10:15,656
You just push 'em out a little earlier,
make it a little harder,

1003
01:10:15,782 --> 01:10:17,950
make it a little more hopeless.

1004
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:20,328
I do what I have to do...

1005
01:10:20,453 --> 01:10:23,456
because it is dangerous to have
a pregnant girl in a classroom.

1006
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:28,294
lt's not a warning, Louanne. I-lt's
prestige, it's stardom, it's attention.

1007
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:30,671
You know, not all these girls
become pregnant by accident.

1008
01:10:30,838 --> 01:10:33,966
- Pregnancy is contagious.
- Yep, yep

1009
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:35,968
- lt's all right
- lt's all right

1010
01:10:36,094 --> 01:10:38,513
As you may have heard

1011
01:10:38,679 --> 01:10:41,474
- Yeah
- To smoke a fat one
- To smoke a fat one

1012
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:44,143
- And drink a 'Bird
- Drink a Thunderbird

1013
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:46,479
- lt's okay
- lt's okay

1014
01:10:46,604 --> 01:10:49,482
- To play this loud
- Play it loud

1015
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:53,569
Mister DJ, don't mean
to sweat you down

1016
01:10:53,736 --> 01:10:55,655
Who is it?

1017
01:10:55,822 --> 01:10:59,075
lt's Louanne Johnson,
Callie's second period teacher.

1018
01:11:03,496 --> 01:11:05,665
Hi.

1019
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:09,001
Um, Callie's getting ready
to go to work.

1020
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:10,878
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

1021
01:11:11,045 --> 01:11:13,548
Curiosity killed the cat

1022
01:11:13,714 --> 01:11:15,508
- Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

1023
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:18,761
- What you doing?
- Watching TV.

1024
01:11:20,596 --> 01:11:23,724
- What's your name?
- Tyeisha.

1025
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:27,103
- Oh, that's a pretty name.
- She just love her TV.

1026
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,815
Why ain't you in bed?
Come here, baby.

1027
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:34,360
Callie? Honey?
Your teacher's here.

1028
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:42,201
- Hi.
- Hi.

1029
01:11:42,326 --> 01:11:45,705
I'm sorry to just bust in
on you like this, but I have
the most wonderful news...

1030
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,666
and I wanted to come
tell you personally.

1031
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:51,919
You do not have to go
to Clearview.

1032
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:57,300
There is nothing in the rules that says
you can't stay exactly where you are.

1033
01:11:57,467 --> 01:11:59,343
But, uh, she already
enrolled in Clearview.

1034
01:11:59,469 --> 01:12:02,597
Uh, well, that's all right. She-- that--
But she doesn't have to go there.

1035
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:06,309
Yeah, but Kimboley wants me
to take the mother-to-be programme
at Clearview, you know.

1036
01:12:06,434 --> 01:12:09,812
He thought it would be a good
idea if I learned how to take
care of the baby and stuff.

1037
01:12:12,106 --> 01:12:14,984
I don't understand.

1038
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:18,738
Do you not want to stay
at Parkmont?

1039
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:22,241
Well, yeah, but I gotta learn how
to take care of us, you know.

1040
01:12:22,366 --> 01:12:24,827
I mean, we're getting our own
place and everything, so--

1041
01:12:28,456 --> 01:12:31,584
Callie, just don't throw away
all you can become.

1042
01:12:33,419 --> 01:12:36,672
Kimboley was so right.
He was so right.

1043
01:12:36,798 --> 01:12:39,592
He told me that you'd probably
try to talk me out of this.

1044
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:41,636
You want to know
what else he said?

1045
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:44,388
He said that you probably
don't even like men...

1046
01:12:44,555 --> 01:12:47,225
and that you're probably not married
and you don't want anybody else to be.

1047
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:50,436
That's why you're always
in everybody else's life.

1048
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:57,860
Look, I'm not saying
that I agree with him, okay?

1049
01:12:58,027 --> 01:13:00,905
Well, Kimboley's wrong.

1050
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:03,449
I was married...

1051
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:05,451
and I was pregnant.

1052
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:10,665
So what happened?

1053
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:15,253
We got divorced...

1054
01:13:15,378 --> 01:13:18,464
and I had an abortion.

1055
01:13:22,135 --> 01:13:24,137
He beat me.

1056
01:13:26,931 --> 01:13:30,268
Well, sometimes
you start out wrong...

1057
01:13:30,435 --> 01:13:33,479
and just keep going.

1058
01:13:47,535 --> 01:13:50,079
Hey, don't touch me.
Oh, get outta here!

1059
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:54,876
I'll see you.

1060
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:57,587
You took something that
fuckin' belonged to me, ése.

1061
01:13:57,754 --> 01:14:00,715
Man, she came to me
with open arms.

1062
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:03,259
Besides, you gotta have
one of these.

1063
01:14:05,344 --> 01:14:07,221
You're dead.

1064
01:14:19,776 --> 01:14:22,612
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

1065
01:14:22,779 --> 01:14:25,948
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothing left

1066
01:14:26,074 --> 01:14:28,618
'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin' so long

1067
01:14:28,785 --> 01:14:31,913
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

1068
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,707
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

1069
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:37,293
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

1070
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:41,172
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

1071
01:14:41,339 --> 01:14:44,383
On my knees in the night
sayin' prayers in the street light

1072
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:49,889
Been spendin' most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1073
01:14:50,014 --> 01:14:52,058
- Hey, Miss Johnson.
- Hey!
- Been spendin' most their lives

1074
01:14:52,183 --> 01:14:55,645
- Haven't seen you guys in a week.
- Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1075
01:14:55,812 --> 01:14:58,397
Thought maybe you got lost
on your way to class.

1076
01:14:58,523 --> 01:15:00,608
I wanted to help you
find your way back.

1077
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:03,444
Get on inside.

1078
01:15:03,569 --> 01:15:06,406
Clean up that pigsty of a room.

1079
01:15:11,702 --> 01:15:14,580
Hi. I'm Louanne Johnson.
I'm the boys' teacher.

1080
01:15:14,747 --> 01:15:16,582
I know who you are.

1081
01:15:16,749 --> 01:15:20,294
You're that white-bread bitch
messin' with my babies' minds.

1082
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,296
I beg your pardon?

1083
01:15:22,422 --> 01:15:25,550
My boys don't go to your school
no more, and that's gonna be it.

1084
01:15:27,343 --> 01:15:29,804
- You took 'em out of school?
- You're damn right I did.

1085
01:15:29,929 --> 01:15:33,766
I saw what they were bringing
home-- poetry and shit.

1086
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:38,688
A waste of time. They got
more important things to worry about.

1087
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:45,153
Don't you think that finishing high
school will be valuable to their future?

1088
01:15:45,278 --> 01:15:47,280
That's not in their future.

1089
01:15:47,405 --> 01:15:51,284
I ain't raising no doctors and lawyers
here. They got bills to pay.

1090
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:53,578
Why don't you just
get on outta here.

1091
01:15:53,703 --> 01:15:57,707
Go find yourself some other
poor boys to save.

1092
01:16:11,304 --> 01:16:14,140
Mama! I could stand
some lemonade.

1093
01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:24,275
"lt is easier
to forgive an enemy...

1094
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:27,028
than to forgive a friend.

1095
01:16:27,153 --> 01:16:31,115
The man who permits you
to injure him...

1096
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,993
deserves your vengeance.

1097
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,538
He also will receive it."

1098
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:40,458
Wow, who wrote that?
Some Mafia guy?

1099
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,460
You know, let's go on
with this poem tomorrow.

1100
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:44,879
Why don't you-- Take out your work
sheets and do the vocabulary drill.

1101
01:16:45,004 --> 01:16:48,382
- Say what?
- Oh, man!
- Man, I don't wanna do no vocabulary.

1102
01:16:48,549 --> 01:16:50,718
I don't wanna do
no damn vocabulary.

1103
01:16:50,885 --> 01:16:53,054
Then don't.

1104
01:16:53,179 --> 01:16:56,641
What do you mean?
You mean I have a choice?

1105
01:16:56,808 --> 01:17:00,561
You're not gonna let me get away with
not learnin' my vocabulary, right?

1106
01:17:04,023 --> 01:17:07,443
That's right. You have to do
your vocabulary.

1107
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:10,279
Words are thoughts
and we can't think without 'em.

1108
01:17:10,405 --> 01:17:13,825
So-- Please?

1109
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:17,620
And so let's just do it, man. She's
gonna be down our back in a minute.

1110
01:17:17,787 --> 01:17:21,124
- Whatever. She's grouchy.
- Grouch.

1111
01:17:21,249 --> 01:17:23,960
- Thanks, Louanne.
- Grouch, grouch.

1112
01:17:24,127 --> 01:17:27,296
Thank you, Louanne.
Such a nice lady, Louanne.

1113
01:17:29,674 --> 01:17:32,885
What do I do?
What the fuck you want from me?

1114
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:35,805
Who, my teacher? You think
I'm gonna fuckin' talk to a teacher?

1115
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:38,433
Like they're gonna
really help me, huh? Huh?

1116
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:41,686
Teachers aren't gonna
fuckin' help me, okay?

1117
01:17:41,853 --> 01:17:45,731
Miss Johnson! Miss Johnson,
we gotta talk to you.

1118
01:17:45,898 --> 01:17:48,860
- There's nothing to talk about, Angela!
- What, are you Superman?

1119
01:17:49,026 --> 01:17:52,029
ls your ass bulletproof?
ls that what you think? Tell her!

1120
01:17:52,196 --> 01:17:54,824
- Tell her what you're gonna do.
- What is it?

1121
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:57,869
- He's strapped.
- Shut the fuck up!
She don't need to know my business.

1122
01:17:57,994 --> 01:18:00,872
ls your business dying? No!

1123
01:18:00,997 --> 01:18:03,916
There's this crackhead named Shorty.
He just came out of jail.

1124
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,502
He says that I'm his girl and
that Emilio took me from him.

1125
01:18:06,669 --> 01:18:09,088
And now he wants to kill Emilio.

1126
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:14,302
Emilio, if this boy is threatening you,
we can go to the police.

1127
01:18:14,427 --> 01:18:16,721
Look, this is nothing you
can do anything about.

1128
01:18:16,846 --> 01:18:19,599
This guy is looking for me to kill me,
and the only way for me to stop him...

1129
01:18:19,724 --> 01:18:22,226
is for me to kill him first.

1130
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:24,687
That's just the way it is,
all right?

1131
01:18:24,812 --> 01:18:28,191
Wait, Emilio, wait, wait, wait, wait,
no! Can we-- Can we talk about this?

1132
01:18:28,316 --> 01:18:31,027
- Come to my house.
- Yeah, right.

1133
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:33,321
Oh, what?
You're too proud to hide?

1134
01:18:33,446 --> 01:18:36,657
lt's better to wander
the streets all night?

1135
01:18:36,824 --> 01:18:39,786
- Come on.
- Please?

1136
01:18:39,952 --> 01:18:41,788
Please, just go.

1137
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:48,461
Go. Go.

1138
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:52,882
- Can we drop you?
- Just go.

1139
01:19:09,065 --> 01:19:11,651
ls this boy your age?

1140
01:19:14,737 --> 01:19:18,074
- Yeah.
- Does he go to Parkmont?

1141
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:21,077
I won't tell you who it is.

1142
01:19:21,202 --> 01:19:23,079
No, don't.

1143
01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:28,251
But if you tell Mr Grandey
about him--

1144
01:19:28,418 --> 01:19:33,756
not about his threatening you,
but about his being on crack--

1145
01:19:33,881 --> 01:19:38,386
he'll be turned over to the juvenile
court for-- for drug abuse in school.

1146
01:19:38,553 --> 01:19:40,888
H-He won't serve hard time,

1147
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:45,268
but by the time he gets out and
he's detoxed, he-- he will have
gotten over trying to kill you.

1148
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:54,360
No, I can't rat on him.

1149
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:57,488
Right. Kill him.
That's better.

1150
01:19:59,031 --> 01:20:01,617
Man,

1151
01:20:01,784 --> 01:20:03,619
you don't understand.

1152
01:20:06,998 --> 01:20:11,794
You asked me once how I was
gonna save you from your life.

1153
01:20:11,961 --> 01:20:14,547
This is how. This moment.

1154
01:20:16,215 --> 01:20:18,968
Right now.

1155
01:20:19,135 --> 01:20:21,512
This will make the difference
in your life forever.

1156
01:20:52,001 --> 01:20:53,878
Emilio?

1157
01:21:01,135 --> 01:21:02,970
Emilio?

1158
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:19,695
- Oh, Mr Grandey.
- ls there a problem, Miss Johnson?

1159
01:21:19,862 --> 01:21:21,864
- Shouldn't you be in class?
- Yes, I'm late.

1160
01:21:22,031 --> 01:21:26,744
Um, I just wanted to ask.
Did Emilio Ramirez come
to your office this morning?

1161
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:29,455
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

1162
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:32,583
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I sent him away.

1163
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:34,794
You-- What do you mean?

1164
01:21:36,879 --> 01:21:40,758
- I mean I sent him away.
- Why?

1165
01:21:40,883 --> 01:21:43,469
Because he didn't knock,
Miss Johnson.

1166
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:47,682
- Here we are.
- Because he didn't knock?

1167
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:52,103
Yes, Miss Johnson. I'm trying to teach
these children how to live in the world.

1168
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:55,481
And in the world, you just don't
burst into someone's office.

1169
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:01,195
Because he didn't knock?

1170
01:22:04,323 --> 01:22:06,534
Damn it!

1171
01:22:39,233 --> 01:22:41,110
Uh, Louanne.

1172
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:45,573
Mr Grandey is with the police.

1173
01:22:45,698 --> 01:22:47,909
- Yes?
- Um.

1174
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:51,621
They just found Emilio Ramirez
three blocks from the school.

1175
01:22:51,746 --> 01:22:54,457
He was shot this morning.

1176
01:22:56,793 --> 01:22:58,628
ls he dead?

1177
01:23:01,672 --> 01:23:05,259
- He's dead.
- I'm very sorry.

1178
01:23:07,053 --> 01:23:09,263
Um...

1179
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:11,474
are you going to tell them now?

1180
01:23:14,018 --> 01:23:16,395
Do you think that's wise?

1181
01:23:19,398 --> 01:23:21,484
Yeah.

1182
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:25,196
Well, uh, perhaps if you talk to them
a little bit about death...

1183
01:23:25,321 --> 01:23:28,491
and-- and-- and what it means.

1184
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:32,161
What would you like me to say?

1185
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:35,164
That if you don't want to die,
remember to knock?

1186
01:23:36,624 --> 01:23:39,252
- That's not fair.
- What is?

1187
01:23:56,602 --> 01:23:58,896
Bad news.

1188
01:24:00,356 --> 01:24:03,443
Emilio was shot this morning.

1189
01:24:05,278 --> 01:24:07,822
ls he dead?

1190
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:11,868
- Yes, baby, he's dead.
- Oh, no.

1191
01:24:59,373 --> 01:25:04,378
Yo! Listen up. Miss Johnson
got something to say!

1192
01:25:04,504 --> 01:25:07,965
- Shh.
- Thank you.

1193
01:25:08,132 --> 01:25:11,469
I just want to say...

1194
01:25:11,594 --> 01:25:14,722
l, uh-- I won't, um--

1195
01:25:17,058 --> 01:25:20,144
I will not be here next year.

1196
01:25:20,269 --> 01:25:22,146
I'm not coming back.

1197
01:25:23,773 --> 01:25:26,067
How come?
ls it something we did?

1198
01:25:26,192 --> 01:25:28,945
No. No, no, no. No. Um--

1199
01:25:32,031 --> 01:25:34,200
I-l never intended to stay.

1200
01:25:34,367 --> 01:25:37,036
Um, this was an unexpected job.

1201
01:25:37,203 --> 01:25:41,124
So if you knew you wasn't
gonna stay, how come you made me
promise what I promised?

1202
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:44,544
I--

1203
01:25:46,587 --> 01:25:49,632
At that time,
I thought I would stay.

1204
01:25:49,799 --> 01:25:51,843
So how come you're leaving?

1205
01:25:53,928 --> 01:25:55,763
I just...

1206
01:25:57,181 --> 01:25:59,642
have my reasons,
certain reasons.

1207
01:25:59,767 --> 01:26:03,896
ls it because it's too sad for you,
what happened to Emilio?

1208
01:26:18,161 --> 01:26:20,121
Maybe.

1209
01:26:20,288 --> 01:26:22,874
And Durrell and Lionel
and Callie. And I just--

1210
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,876
I just think that--

1211
01:26:29,714 --> 01:26:33,050
So if you love us so much and you're
so interested in our graduating,

1212
01:26:33,176 --> 01:26:36,220
- how come you choose to leave?
- Yeah.

1213
01:26:36,345 --> 01:26:41,184
You sad about Durrell and Callie
and Emilio and Lionel, but we're here.

1214
01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:44,937
What about us, huh?
None of us make you feel happy?

1215
01:26:45,104 --> 01:26:49,692
We been working hard and we stayed
in school, man. What about us?

1216
01:26:49,817 --> 01:26:52,028
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1217
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:10,463
Why are you packing up today
when tomorrow is your last day?

1218
01:27:11,672 --> 01:27:13,549
Oh, just gettin' a head start.

1219
01:27:15,093 --> 01:27:16,969
Oh, I see.

1220
01:27:21,057 --> 01:27:25,561
What you did, when you
gave me the 200 dollars?

1221
01:27:28,272 --> 01:27:33,569
That was the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.

1222
01:27:33,694 --> 01:27:36,155
I don't know anybody else
who would give 200 dollars...

1223
01:27:36,322 --> 01:27:38,908
to a Mexican kid
on his word of honour.

1224
01:27:44,872 --> 01:27:47,333
S-So you gotta let me
pay you back.

1225
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:54,173
Even if I don't graduate,
all right?

1226
01:27:54,298 --> 01:27:57,009
Why wouldn't you graduate?

1227
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,681
Ain't no other teacher
gonna give me no "A."

1228
01:28:01,806 --> 01:28:04,517
Yes, they will, if you work for them
the way you worked for me.

1229
01:28:04,642 --> 01:28:07,186
No, but it was different with you.
You gave me an "A" to start with.

1230
01:28:07,353 --> 01:28:11,732
- I didn't have to earn it.
I just had to keep it.
- Are you kidding?

1231
01:28:11,858 --> 01:28:16,404
Keeping an "A" is harder than getting an
"A." Almost anyone can get an "A" once.

1232
01:28:16,571 --> 01:28:19,657
But keeping it,
that's an accomplishment.

1233
01:28:19,824 --> 01:28:22,702
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

1234
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:25,496
Do you realize the work
you did this term?

1235
01:28:25,621 --> 01:28:29,208
Do you realize that
the poetry that we read...

1236
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:31,335
is given to people in college?

1237
01:28:31,502 --> 01:28:33,671
- ln college.
- These same poems?

1238
01:28:33,796 --> 01:28:37,133
- Yes.
- But they weren't even so hard.

1239
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:39,177
So, you see?

1240
01:28:41,345 --> 01:28:43,723
Keep working.

1241
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:46,225
You'll graduate.

1242
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,814
I might even see you
in college.

1243
01:28:51,939 --> 01:28:53,816
What do you think?

1244
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:14,128
I feel so bad about leaving
I can hardly breathe.

1245
01:29:14,295 --> 01:29:18,382
I know, but-- Oh, what the hell.
You're right.

1246
01:29:18,549 --> 01:29:23,096
You gotta be crazy to stay here
and teach these programme classes.

1247
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:25,848
There's no money.
lt's killer work.

1248
01:29:28,309 --> 01:29:30,645
Why do you stay?

1249
01:29:30,812 --> 01:29:33,272
Why do I smoke?
I'm crazy.

1250
01:29:33,397 --> 01:29:35,358
You need any more help?

1251
01:29:35,483 --> 01:29:37,777
No. Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1252
01:29:37,944 --> 01:29:39,779
Yeah. Bye.

1253
01:29:41,656 --> 01:29:44,700
This is the life

1254
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:48,746
Everyone has to be somewhere

1255
01:29:51,165 --> 01:29:53,876
Oh

1256
01:29:54,043 --> 01:29:59,882
I am here

1257
01:30:02,593 --> 01:30:06,764
This is the life

1258
01:30:06,889 --> 01:30:09,600
This is the life

1259
01:30:10,977 --> 01:30:15,189
'Cause this is my life

1260
01:30:15,314 --> 01:30:20,737
This is my life

1261
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,157
Hi.

1262
01:30:26,993 --> 01:30:31,122
Well. Welcome back.

1263
01:30:31,289 --> 01:30:35,084
This is the 29th day,
the last day I have to come back.

1264
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:38,379
So, am I still okay
for next term?

1265
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:41,466
Yeah.

1266
01:30:43,384 --> 01:30:45,762
Did, uh,

1267
01:30:45,928 --> 01:30:49,849
did you come back because
it was your last day or did somebody...

1268
01:30:50,016 --> 01:30:53,269
ask you to come today
to talk me into staying?

1269
01:30:53,436 --> 01:30:56,189
Well, it was both, really.

1270
01:30:56,355 --> 01:31:00,777
See, 'cause I wasn't really sure
what I wanted to do...

1271
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:03,821
until I heard that you
were leaving and--

1272
01:31:03,946 --> 01:31:06,532
'Cause up until then,
I don't know, I thought...

1273
01:31:06,699 --> 01:31:10,078
that you'd always be here
for me, you know.

1274
01:31:10,203 --> 01:31:12,371
You know, whenever I came back.

1275
01:31:13,956 --> 01:31:16,459
But then Raul tells me
that you're leaving...

1276
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:18,461
just like that.

1277
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:24,425
And I realized that this
was my last chance.

1278
01:31:26,594 --> 01:31:28,596
And I decided--

1279
01:31:29,889 --> 01:31:32,975
We decided that...

1280
01:31:33,101 --> 01:31:35,394
we're not gonna just
let you leave like that.

1281
01:31:38,272 --> 01:31:40,817
Yeah, we realized
like the poem said:

1282
01:31:40,983 --> 01:31:43,736
You can't give in.

1283
01:31:43,861 --> 01:31:46,072
"You can't go gentle.

1284
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,326
- You got to rage against
the dying of the light."
- Yeah.

1285
01:31:50,493 --> 01:31:52,703
Yeah, you gotta go for yours.
You know that, right?

1286
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:55,915
- Yeah.
- You gotta kick it in and get it up.

1287
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:59,335
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, no. Wait, wait. I'm not giving in.

1288
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:03,047
Um, this is my choice.

1289
01:32:03,214 --> 01:32:06,467
I have no reason to "rage
against the dying of the light."

1290
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:09,595
'Cause you're not the one who's raging.
We're the ones who are raging.

1291
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,014
See, 'cause we see you
as being our light.

1292
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:18,104
- What?
- You're our Tambourine Man.

1293
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:23,109
- Oh, I'm your drug dealer?
- You got the stuff, Miss J?

1294
01:32:23,234 --> 01:32:27,280
You're our teacher. You got
what we need. lt's the same thing.

1295
01:32:27,405 --> 01:32:31,242
Come on, Miss J. All the poems
you taught us say you can't give in.

1296
01:32:31,409 --> 01:32:33,661
You can't give up.

1297
01:32:33,786 --> 01:32:36,664
- Well, we ain't giving you up.
- No way.

1298
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:41,210
Now, listen, baby, we gonna have to
tie you down to the chair and gag you...

1299
01:32:41,335 --> 01:32:46,340
'cause you know
we want you to stay.

1300
01:32:46,466 --> 01:32:51,179
What you need to stay, girl?
You want a candy bar?

1301
01:32:51,304 --> 01:32:55,808
Okay, on the left and on the right,
a "Louanne, Louanne." Uh, here we go.

1302
01:32:55,933 --> 01:32:59,312
Louanne, Louanne,
Louanne, Louanne.

1303
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:02,899
- Louanne, Louanne, Louanne, Louanne.
- Come on!

1304
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:07,612
Louanne, Louanne,
Louanne, Louanne.

1305
01:33:12,825 --> 01:33:17,080
- You have to go first.
- I don't want to go first.
- Come on. You have to.

1306
01:33:17,246 --> 01:33:19,082
Ready? You go like this. Go.

1307
01:33:21,584 --> 01:33:23,795
- lt go like this.
- This how you do it.

1308
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,882
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.

1309
01:33:28,007 --> 01:33:31,135
Go, Louanne. Go, Louanne.
Go, Louanne.

1310
01:33:37,767 --> 01:33:40,520
Let me see.

1311
01:33:40,645 --> 01:33:43,606
- Excuse me.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1312
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:49,195
- You want to sign my book?
- Yeah, I'll sign your book.

1313
01:34:13,845 --> 01:34:16,556
How'd they get you
to come back?

1314
01:34:16,722 --> 01:34:20,309
They gave me candy
and called me "the light."

1315
01:34:20,476 --> 01:34:22,311
That'll do it.

1316
01:34:51,382 --> 01:34:53,801
I won't do you wrong

1317
01:34:53,968 --> 01:34:56,262
I'll do you right

1318
01:34:56,429 --> 01:35:01,309
You can roll with me
for the rest of the night

1319
01:35:01,476 --> 01:35:05,772
No need to fuss
'cause I don't wanna joke

1320
01:35:05,897 --> 01:35:09,901
Baby, sit right here
and let the chronic smoke

1321
01:35:10,026 --> 01:35:12,945
So hang around, love

1322
01:35:13,112 --> 01:35:15,907
And give it up

1323
01:35:16,074 --> 01:35:20,369
'Cause all the real "G"s
know what I'm thinkin' of

1324
01:35:20,495 --> 01:35:26,084
'Cause you wanna be down, down
so give it up

1325
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:30,213
There's a party over here
So, baby, show your love

1326
01:35:30,379 --> 01:35:34,550
'Cause I got the gin and juice
Yeah

1327
01:35:34,717 --> 01:35:37,804
- You know that, you know that
- I got the gin and juice

1328
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,598
Yeah

1329
01:35:40,765 --> 01:35:44,977
'Cause I got the gin and juice
Yeah

1330
01:35:47,355 --> 01:35:49,982
- I got the, I got the gin and juice
- Yeah

1331
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:53,986
- I got the answer
- 'Cause I got the gin and juice

1332
01:36:03,329 --> 01:36:06,082
As I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

1333
01:36:06,249 --> 01:36:09,502
I take a look at my life
and realize there's nothing left

1334
01:36:09,627 --> 01:36:12,171
'Cause I've been blastin'
and laughin' so long

1335
01:36:12,338 --> 01:36:15,550
That even my mama thinks
that my mind is gone

1336
01:36:15,675 --> 01:36:18,386
I really hate to trip
but I gotta loc

1337
01:36:18,511 --> 01:36:22,098
As they croak I see myself
in the pistol smoke

1338
01:36:22,223 --> 01:36:24,308
Fool, I'm the kind of "G"
the little homies wanna be like

1339
01:36:24,434 --> 01:36:28,020
On my knees in the night
Sayin' prayers in the street light

1340
01:36:28,187 --> 01:36:33,985
Been spending most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1341
01:36:34,152 --> 01:36:39,866
Been spending most their lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1342
01:36:39,991 --> 01:36:46,205
We keep spending most our lives
livin' in a gangsta's paradise

1343
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,802
You spent so many nights
in heat

1344
01:36:59,927 --> 01:37:02,555
- And out of control
- Like that

1345
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:05,183
Waiting impatiently to see

1346
01:37:05,349 --> 01:37:07,852
- What's under my clothes
- Like that

1347
01:37:07,977 --> 01:37:13,107
I just wanna take time
to get right into the point

1348
01:37:13,232 --> 01:37:15,151
Now you got your choice, girl

1349
01:37:15,276 --> 01:37:18,279
- To come and rock this funky joint
- Like that

1350
01:37:18,404 --> 01:37:23,993
Don't you take too long, baby

1351
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:29,123
I'll be waitin' here
for you, baby, baby

1352
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:34,253
Here's a gift
to you from me

1353
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:38,925
Just you wait and see
lt's the curiosity

1354
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:44,764
- lt's the curiosity

1355
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:47,934
- Do you wanna feel my body
- Like that

1356
01:37:48,101 --> 01:37:49,936
Girl, all night long, yeah

1357
01:37:50,103 --> 01:37:52,855

01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,612

lt's the curiosity
