1
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,860
Boy, why are you crying?

2
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,654
Because I couldn't
get my shadow to stick.

3
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:59,157
Besides, I wasn't crying.

4
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:02,076
I shall sew it on for you,
my little man.

5
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:06,247
I shall sew it on for you,
my little man. It may hurt a little.

6
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:07,916
What's your name?

7
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:10,126
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

8
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,295
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.

9
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:14,798
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.

10
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:16,883
She's stealing the show.

11
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:20,136
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.

12
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,179
Louder!

13
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:24,808
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.

14
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:28,770
I shall give you a kiss if you like.

15
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,898
Don't you know what a kiss is?

16
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:34,609
I shall, once you give one to me.

17
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:42,534
Now I shall give you a kiss.

18
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,129
I don't ever wanna become a man.

19
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,592
I always wanna be a little boy
and have fun.

20
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:06,517
{y:i}We wanna be like Peter Pan
{y:i}We don't wanna grow up

21
00:02:09,853 --> 00:02:11,105
Brad.

22
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:14,858
Yeah, I'm at my daughter's play.

23
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:24,243
It's impossible. I'm on a plane
to London tomorrow night with my family.

24
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:28,205
A children's hospital is dedicating
an entire wing to Granny Wendy.

25
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:29,457
Brad....

26
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,542
Peter, you're missing it.

27
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,087
All right. I want a meeting,
tomorrow a.m.

28
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:38,215
Dad, my game! You promised.

29
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,301
Listen, it's my son's big game.

30
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,472
Last game of the season. Santa Series.
I gotta be there. I promised.

31
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:46,682
We'll make it short.

32
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:49,477
I'll be there. My word is my bond.

33
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,522
{y:i}We never, never, never
{y:i}Never, never, never, never

34
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,150
{y:i}Never, never, ever wanna grow up

35
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:58,861
Strike three! You're out.

36
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,869
Bluejays, come on!

37
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,289
Jack! Come on, Bluejays!

38
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:10,457
Bluejays!

39
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,877
Fire it up!

40
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,342
Where is your father? He's missing it.

41
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,887
Daddy'll be here. He promised.

42
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,138
Jerry? Jack?

43
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:26,389
- Jim.
- I said that.

44
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:29,643
Go to the game ahead of me.
Film what I miss.

45
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,437
This is the speech
for your grandmother's tribute.

46
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,480
- On cards?
- Yes.

47
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,690
- Number those. Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.

48
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,651
I loved his annual report.
Read it.

49
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,447
"For the past 70 years,
the Granny Wendy we honour tonight...

50
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,993
has given hope and care
and life to hundreds of orphans."

51
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,244
Great.

52
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,454
Mommy, where's Daddy?

53
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,050
My briefcase.

54
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:15,731
Gotta fly.

55
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,234
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars.

56
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:21,987
It's a lot safer to fly
than crossing the street.

57
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,490
If it's your time to go,
it's your time to go.

58
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:28,452
And remember,
don't let your arms get tired!

59
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,247
What if it's the pilot's time to go?

60
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,375
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
Keep us alive!

61
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,418
Okay, come on!

62
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:39,589
Hi, Mrs. Banning. I'm from the office.
Which one's your son?

63
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:42,300
- He's up to bat!
- Thank you!

64
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,802
Come on, Jack!

65
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,098
Come on, pal!

66
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:50,141
Come on, Jack!

67
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,101
Don't look at me! Focus!

68
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:55,438
Stay focused! Come on, Jack.
One time, Jack.

69
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,400
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,946
Please, not a curve ball.

71
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,116
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!

72
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:13,790
That's the game!

73
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:04,883
Yeah, Brad, that's real good.

74
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:15,728
{y:i}Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
{y:i}your captain again.

75
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:19,690
{y:i}Please do not allow this minor
{y:i}turbulence to disturb you.

76
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,871
{y:i}For now, please sit back, relax.
{y:i}Enjoy the remainder of the flight.

77
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,331
{y:i}Thank you.

78
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,042
Look what Jack drew!

79
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:39,836
That's very nice, dear.

80
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:41,170
What's that?

81
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:42,547
Fire.

82
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,632
Fire! Really?

83
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,384
Is that our plane?

84
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:49,011
Who are these people?

85
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,849
That's Jack, that's me, that's Mom...

86
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:54,726
and that's you.

87
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:56,811
Where's my parachute?

88
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,067
- I won't make it to my birthday.
- You won't die without a phone.

89
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,153
I got the phone in the briefcase.

90
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,738
Talk to him.

91
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:15,789
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?

92
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:17,457
Take a wild guess.

93
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,168
- Jackie!
- Jack.

94
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:22,379
Will you stop?
You can break a window.

95
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,673
They're layered.
You can't break them.

96
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,633
Give me that.

97
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,763
You're afraid you'll get sucked out.

98
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,223
I'm not afraid.

99
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,934
Yes, you are. You're afraid
you'll be sucked out.

100
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:37,686
Just stop.

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,359
Jack, next season,
I'm coming to six games. I promise.

102
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:47,905
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.

103
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,578
My word is my bond.

104
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:56,580
Yeah, junk bond!

105
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,503
When are you gonna stop
acting like a child?

106
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,797
I am a child.

107
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:06,256
Grow up.

108
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,010
{y:i}It's been a long time.

109
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,887
{y:i}Let's have fun, Peter.

110
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:14,181
London's a magical place
for children.

111
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,058
- It was for us.
- And expensive.

112
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,186
Jack, don't do that.
You could put someone's eye out.

113
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,188
Maggie. Maggie.

114
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,274
Peter, it's number 14.

115
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,400
Sorry.

116
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,485
What do you say to Granny Wendy?

117
00:08:26,694 --> 00:08:28,779
- "How do you do?"
- Jack, get down!

118
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,031
Be careful.

119
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,784
Is Granny Wendy the real,
real Wendy from my play?

120
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,036
No, not really.

121
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:36,704
Sort of.

122
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,374
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.

123
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:44,337
It's time to look our best. First
impressions are the most important.

124
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:46,506
Shoes tied. Shirt tucked.

125
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:47,965
You know this.

126
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,928
Remember, you're in England,
land of good manners.

127
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:52,971
Uncle Tootles.

128
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,056
It's snowing!

129
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:08,737
Look at these adorable children!

130
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:11,322
It's good to see you,
Libby... Linda... Lisa...

131
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,616
- Liza.
- I said that.

132
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,370
Oh, Moira, how are you?
You look wonderful!

133
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,039
Oh, my God!

134
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,081
Look at the size...

135
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,500
Look at you! Such a sweet thing!

136
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,046
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs? Oh, good.

137
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:30,425
- Big boy! You could play rugby.
- No, baseball.

138
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:31,551
Oh, look.

139
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,471
- Did you do this for us?
- We've been cooking all week.

140
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,225
You've been cooking?
What've you been cooking? Mince pies?

141
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,519
Peter, look at this.
Look at this.

142
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,604
- Who's that?
- It's you.

143
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:44,815
Was I ever that young?

144
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,652
- What's gotten into you?
- This house has gotten to me.

145
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:52,197
Some of those things I was when
I was young have never left me.

146
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:55,117
Oh, thank God!
We were children in these rooms.

147
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,162
Lost, lost, lost.

148
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,705
Lost what?

149
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,625
I've lost my marbles.

150
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,961
Lisa?

151
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:07,838
Liza.

152
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,966
- He was supposed to be in a home.
- It broke Wendy's heart.

153
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,385
Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
Which is which?

154
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:16,597
Large bag's mine, and the smaller ones
are the children's.

155
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:18,474
Hello, boy.

156
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,443
Hello, Wendy.

157
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:41,831
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here,
by hook or by crook.

158
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,921
I'm sorry it's been
so long between visits.

159
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,800
It's been 10 years between visits.
But never mind.

160
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,386
Come and give me a skwoodge.

161
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:05,188
Oh, Moira, Moira, Moira!

162
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,858
Who is this lovely lady?

163
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,402
It can't be Maggie.

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,572
Yes, it can. And know what?
I just played you at school.

165
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,658
And don't you just look the part.

166
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,829
Can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year!

167
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:22,914
I'm supposed to tell you about...

168
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:27,294
congratulations for opening
the orphan hospital...

169
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:30,839
and how great the dedication is.

170
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:34,718
- Thank you so very much.
- Welcome.

171
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:39,598
Now, there is one rule I insist
be obeyed while you are in my house:

172
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:42,726
No growing up.

173
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,271
Stop this very instant.

174
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,608
And that includes you,
Mr. Chairman-of-the-Board Banning.

175
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,068
Sorry, too late, Gran.

176
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:55,572
And what's so terribly important
about your terribly important business?

177
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,367
You see, when a big
company's in trouble...

178
00:11:58,575 --> 00:12:01,495
Dad sails in, and if
there's any resistance...

179
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,623
He's exaggerating. I'm still
into mergers and acquisitions.

180
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:07,334
And I'm dabbling in
some land development.

181
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,671
Any resistance and he blows them
out of the water.

182
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,801
So!

183
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,638
Peter, you've become a pirate!

184
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,250
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent!

185
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,966
Do you like my dress?

186
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:37,843
Great, Gran.

187
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,554
Thanks.

188
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,516
Hey, Brad. Good news?

189
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:46,727
What?

190
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,564
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.

191
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:55,778
He's trying to suck my blood!
He drools all over my neck.

192
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:57,029
What did they find?

193
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,366
- That's a portable phone...
- A Cozy Blue Owl?

194
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,954
Well, listen.

195
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:08,833
Ask them if anybody
misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

196
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:13,295
Oh, well, I do! Boy, do I ever!
Wow, you kidding?

197
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:14,463
Wait a minute.

198
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:18,718
You telling me a 10-inch owl
has a 50-mile mating radius?

199
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,762
Why don't they just
fornicate someplace else?

200
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:26,851
You're telling me a 5-billion-dollar
deal is falling apart because of this?

201
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:29,353
Somebody shoot me in the head!

202
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,439
Bang! Bang!

203
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,107
Will everybody just shut up!

204
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:34,358
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:36,444
Leave me alone for one moment!

206
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:39,572
Get them out of here!
I'm on the phone call of my life!

207
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,909
Come on, Jack. Out, out, out.

208
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,828
Come with me.

209
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:51,042
I'll show you the window where your
dad and I used to blow out the stars.

210
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,839
I should've stayed
till the deal was done.

211
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,550
Granny asked you to visit every year.

212
00:14:58,758 --> 00:14:59,801
I've been busy.

213
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,597
You promised the children some real time
here. You haven't looked at them once.

214
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,934
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises?

215
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,693
It's Brad, Moira.
I gotta take this call.

216
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:18,904
I gotta fix this.

217
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:21,907
No, you gotta fix your family first.

218
00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:31,833
{y:i}Peter, hello? Are you there?

219
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:38,799
What...?

220
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,595
- I'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.

221
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:47,766
I hated the deal. But I'm sorry
you feel so badly about it.

222
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,686
Your children love you.

223
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,980
They want to play with you.

224
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,899
How long do you think that lasts?

225
00:15:56,734 --> 00:16:00,070
Soon Jack may not even want you
to come to his games.

226
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:04,658
We have a few special years
with our children...

227
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,578
when they're the ones
that want us around.

228
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:11,332
Then you'll be running after them
for a bit of attention.

229
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:14,460
It's so fast, Peter.

230
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,631
It's a few years, then it's over.

231
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,470
And you are not being careful.

232
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,850
And you are missing it.

233
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:37,400
{y:i}Peter, where are you?

234
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,699
{y:i}Peter! Peter! Peter!

235
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:49,913
"All children, except one, grow up."

236
00:16:50,663 --> 00:16:54,083
Now, you know where faeries come from,
don't you, Maggie?

237
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:58,671
"When the first baby laughed
for the first time...

238
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,800
the laugh broke
into a thousand pieces...

239
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:04,219
and they all went skipping about.

240
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:06,805
That was the beginning of faeries."

241
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,056
And look.

242
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,435
I'm Wendy.

243
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:16,189
Or was, a long time ago.

244
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:20,777
But Jack says you're not
the really " real" Wendy.

245
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,071
Do you see where Jack is?

246
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,784
Well, that's the same window.
And this is the same room...

247
00:17:27,993 --> 00:17:32,664
where we made up stories about Peter,
Never Land and scary old Captain Hook.

248
00:17:32,873 --> 00:17:36,835
And do you know, Mr. Barrie, well,
Sir James, our neighbour...

249
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:41,215
loved our stories so much that
he wrote them all down in a book.

250
00:17:41,423 --> 00:17:44,343
Oh, dear me, 80 years ago.

251
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,970
You're really old!

252
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,139
That's very true.

253
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,018
I'm sorry to break this up.
I have to steal Granny...

254
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:56,647
or she'll be late for the most
important event of her life.

255
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,777
Oh, dear.

256
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:05,406
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.

257
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:09,160
It's a hug. Next time you fly,
you won't have to be scared.

258
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,662
She's made you a parachute.

259
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:14,165
That's very clever, dear.

260
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:16,584
Get away from there!

261
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:21,881
What have I told you about playing near
open windows? Keep this window closed.

262
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,758
Do we have open windows at home?

263
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,260
No. They've all got bars on them.

264
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:28,137
Come on. lnto bed.

265
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,351
Who took my baseball?

266
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:37,105
That mean, scary man
at the window stole it.

267
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:38,564
There's no scary man.

268
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:41,818
But he says he's a window washer.

269
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,404
What's this?

270
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:47,448
A baseball glove.
You can catch things with it...

271
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,994
take hot things out of the oven,
hit your sister with it.

272
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:56,291
Tootles made it for me.
It smells nice.

273
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:57,959
It's paper, honey.

274
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:05,675
Hey, Jack.

275
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,969
Faker.

276
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:11,640
You're in charge now.

277
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:15,685
This is my very special watch,
so you can keep track of the time.

278
00:19:15,894 --> 00:19:18,814
Don't go out, Mom. Please.

279
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:24,861
Good night.

280
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:36,874
Dear night-lights,
protect my sleeping babes.

281
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:40,919
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.

282
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:49,470
I read recently that they're now using
lawyers instead of rats for experiments.

283
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:51,764
They do this for two reasons:

284
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:56,352
One, the scientists become
less attached to the lawyers.

285
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:01,148
And two, there are certain things
that even rats won't do.

286
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:10,533
I thank the Board of Trustees
of the Ormond Street Hospital...

287
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,827
for having me here this evening...

288
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,832
and beg your forgiveness because
normally I address shareholders.

289
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:24,505
We don't know each other, and I doubt
that we have very much in common...

290
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:28,885
except this wonderful woman,
Wendy Angela Darling.

291
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,681
Granny Wendy brought me in
from the cold.

292
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,184
She taught me to read and write.

293
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:39,437
She even found people to be
my parents and adopt me.

294
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,274
She's loved so many children...

295
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:47,862
just so efforlete...
efforse... effortlessly.

296
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:50,156
That's her achievement.

297
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:53,410
Many of you here tonight
were once lost children...

298
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:57,247
but Granny Wendy found parents
and homes for each of you...

299
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,832
and saved you.

300
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,083
That's her miracle.

301
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:05,797
I know that if you could stand now, you
would express much better than I have...

302
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:09,968
your feelings of gratitude...

303
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,347
appreciation...

304
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,310
and warm feelings...

305
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,021
for this wonderful woman.

306
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,373
I guess we do have
something in common.

307
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,335
We're orphans.

308
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:05,024
Hook!

309
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,361
Hook.

310
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:44,647
Jack....

311
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:26,982
You all right?

312
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,442
Wendy?

313
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:46,794
Thank you, Nigel. Norman?

314
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:48,170
Neville, sir.

315
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:49,922
Is that English?

316
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,007
Merry Christmas.

317
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:55,761
I was proud of you.

318
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,180
It was a beautiful speech.

319
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:00,141
Yes, it was.

320
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:21,204
Liza?

321
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,080
Tootles?

322
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:30,380
My God! The children!

323
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:39,138
Jack! Answer me!

324
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,598
Maggie!

325
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,603
The wind came up.
The door closed on me...

326
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:48,106
and the children were screaming!

327
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:51,651
The children were screaming!

328
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,121
The window.

329
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:17,511
"Dear Peter:

330
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:21,056
Your presence is required
at the request of your children.

331
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:25,644
Kindest personal regards...

332
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:27,521
J.A.S. Hook...

333
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:29,398
Captain."

334
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:37,740
Have to fly. Have to fight.

335
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:42,119
Have to crow. Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.

336
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,247
Hook is back.

337
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:47,541
Who?

338
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:50,252
Gran!

339
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:58,594
Well, the lab boys can
analyse this little lot.

340
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,225
We've wired the phones, and two
of my lads will be outside at all times.

341
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:08,396
It's possible that this
is some kind of ridiculous prank.

342
00:26:08,604 --> 00:26:10,481
My children are missing.

343
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:14,861
Yes, but the literary history
of the family suggests....

344
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,112
Let's hope...

345
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,406
I've forgotten how to fly.

346
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,534
Yeah, well, one does.

347
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,036
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

348
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:29,876
No more happy thoughts.

349
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:32,295
Lost!

350
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,881
Lost!

351
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:51,564
- The police will do everything they can.
- The police can do nothing.

352
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:55,110
Really? Maybe we should
call the American police.

353
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:57,946
In a crisis, we English
always make a cup of tea.

354
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,281
Moira, would you?

355
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:00,532
Yes, of course.

356
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,034
Don't forget to warm the pot.

357
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:05,745
I'll go.

358
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:08,248
You stay.

359
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:11,918
Don't worry, Gran Wendy,
I wasn't gonna leave.

360
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:15,756
Hand me my book, please.

361
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,889
It's time to tell you, at last.

362
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,017
Tell me what?

363
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,022
How far back can you remember, Peter?

364
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,193
I remember the hospital
on Great Ormond Street.

365
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:38,487
You worked with orphans.

366
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:42,241
You arranged for the adoption
by my American parents.

367
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:45,077
You were 12, nearly 13.

368
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:47,246
I mean, before that.

369
00:27:47,663 --> 00:27:49,331
There's nothing before that.

370
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,294
Try, Peter. Do try.

371
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:56,630
Nothing.

372
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:03,929
You know, when I was young...

373
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:09,560
no other girl held your favour
the way I did.

374
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:16,859
I expected you to alight on the church
and forbid my vows on my wedding day.

375
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:21,030
I wore a pink satin sash.

376
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,618
But you didn't come.

377
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:28,538
Grandma?

378
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,668
Yes, I was an old lady
when I wrapped you in blankets.

379
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:35,628
A grandmother.

380
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:38,673
With my 1 3-year-old granddaughter
asleep in the bed.

381
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:40,133
Moira.

382
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,927
And when you saw her...

383
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,515
that was when you decided
not to go back to Never Land.

384
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,269
Where?

385
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:53,980
To Never Never Land.

386
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:58,568
- I'll get Moira.
- I've tried to tell you...

387
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:01,488
- Maybe the tea's ready.
- I knew you'd forgotten!

388
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,698
I'm not ready to deal with this now.

389
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:07,869
The stories are true. I swear to you.

390
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:10,789
I swear on everything I adore.

391
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:14,001
And now he's come back
to seek his revenge.

392
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,837
The fight isn't over
for Captain James Hook.

393
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:17,963
He wants you back.

394
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:21,717
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack
to the ends of the earth.

395
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:25,262
And, by heaven, you must find a way.

396
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:29,850
Only you can save your children.

397
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:34,021
Somehow, you must go back.

398
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,400
You must make yourself remember.

399
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,946
Remember what?

400
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,785
Peter, don't you know who you are?

401
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,516
Yes, boy.

402
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,436
Yes.

403
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,702
Sorry.

404
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,338
Parachute....

405
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,305
Firefly from hell!

406
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,934
Big damn bug!

407
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,492
It is you! It is! A big you!

408
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,203
It's not bad you're big.
You were always big.

409
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,539
Maybe this means you'll
be twice as much fun.

410
00:31:56,791 --> 00:32:00,336
What fun we'll have again!
What times! What great games!

411
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,550
You're a little....

412
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,886
Faerie.

413
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,100
Pixie.

414
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,019
If less is more, there's
no end to me, Peter Pan.

415
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:18,108
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.

416
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,313
- Banning.
- Pan.

417
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:21,607
Whoever you are, it's still you.

418
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,402
Because only one
person has that smell.

419
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:25,862
Smell?

420
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,489
The smell of someone
who's ridden the wind.

421
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:33,286
The smell of sleeping in trees.
Adventures with lndians and pirates.

422
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:37,040
Remember? The world was ours!
We could do everything or nothing.

423
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,043
I had to be anything
because it was always us.

424
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,216
It's happened. I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

425
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,718
Follow me and all will be well.

426
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:52,347
I'm dying. Heading towards
the white light. I've left my body.

427
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,058
There's my house down there.
There are my feet.

428
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:58,103
- Where are we going?
- To save your children!

429
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,605
- How do you know about my kids?
- Everybody knows!

430
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:04,151
Hook's got them and
you've gotta fight him! Let's fly!

431
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,744
It is true, then.
You did grow up.

432
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:19,374
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me "Tink."

433
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,586
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, bug?

434
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,214
I'm not a bug. I'm a faerie.

435
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:31,970
I do not believe in faeries.

436
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:37,393
Anytime someone says, "I do not believe
in faeries," a faerie falls down dead.

437
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,270
I do not believe in faeries!!

438
00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:53,159
My God, I think I killed it.

439
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,204
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!

440
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,541
Clap your hands, Peter.

441
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,335
It's the only way to save me.

442
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,212
Clap....

443
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,923
Louder.

444
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,425
Louder, Peter!

445
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:14,013
I'm clapping!

446
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,599
Oh, God, you're alive!

447
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:19,102
All right. Now, who am l?

448
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:30,363
You're a Freudian
hallucination of my mother.

449
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:33,825
I don't know why you have wings,
but you have lovely legs.

450
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:35,910
What am I saying?
I'm an orphan.

451
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,873
I've never taken drugs. I missed
the '60s. I was an accountant.

452
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:41,332
Guess again!

453
00:34:44,044 --> 00:34:45,712
Look, stars!

454
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,255
That's right, Peter.

455
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:50,508
Second star to the right
and straight on till morning.

456
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:53,220
Never Land!

457
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:56,826
What a nightmare!

458
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,429
Roll out! Roll out!

459
00:36:27,774 --> 00:36:31,236
Lovely fish! Fresh fish!

460
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:35,407
We keep the eyes in so
they'll see you through the week!

461
00:36:40,078 --> 00:36:43,123
Excuse me. Is there
a pay phone around here?

462
00:36:43,623 --> 00:36:44,582
That is so real.

463
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,917
Peter, get back here!

464
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,586
Get down! Get low!

465
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:48,962
Hide!

466
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:54,050
If it ain't the Mother lnferior.

467
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,052
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.

468
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,598
I fancy them shiny
shoes for my booties.

469
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:01,892
I think you can
get them at Armani.

470
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:05,646
Tink! Tink! Help!

471
00:37:08,649 --> 00:37:10,317
Don't get no blood on them boots!

472
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:12,110
They's mine!

473
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:13,987
Help me! Tinkerbell!

474
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:16,698
You pixie devil!

475
00:37:20,744 --> 00:37:23,163
Please don't! I have a bad back!

476
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,126
You pixie devil!

477
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:36,510
Are you related
to Mighty Mouse?

478
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,435
If you insist on seeing Hook...

479
00:37:44,643 --> 00:37:45,978
do exactly what I say.

480
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:49,523
Your left arm is dead
and hangs lifeless at your side.

481
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:53,194
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.

482
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:56,322
Tilt your head and
glare with your good eye!

483
00:37:56,614 --> 00:38:00,076
Now crack your mouth
and drool. Now growl!

484
00:38:00,284 --> 00:38:01,118
Growl!

485
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,204
- How are you?
- Not bad, and you?

486
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:04,872
Not bad!

487
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:29,272
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!

488
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:34,903
Follow that Hook!

489
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:37,614
Make way for the Hook!

490
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:41,660
Me mother loves that Hook!

491
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:51,795
Give us the Hook!

492
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:55,549
Give us the Hook!

493
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,665
Good morning, Never Land!

494
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:31,001
Good morning, Mr. Smee!

495
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,129
Tie down the main mast, mateys.

496
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:37,049
Because here he is!
The cunning kingfish!

497
00:39:37,758 --> 00:39:39,009
The brave barracuda!

498
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:43,931
A man so deep, he's
almost unfathomable.

499
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:50,604
A man so quick,
he's even fast asleep!

500
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:52,064
Thank you!

501
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:54,150
Let's give him a very big hand...

502
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,652
because he's only got one.

503
00:39:58,321 --> 00:40:01,866
I give you the
steel-handed stingray...

504
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:04,869
Captain James Hook!

505
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,080
Hook! Hook! Hook! Hook...!

506
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:18,132
See how greatly
the men favour you, sir?

507
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:22,095
The pealing spawn.
How I despise them!

508
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,180
Go get 'em, captain!

509
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:29,394
Thank you!

510
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:36,568
Well, my stupid, sorry,
parasitic sacks of entrails....

511
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:41,156
Revenge is mine.

512
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:44,284
Long live the Hook!

513
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,537
I baited that Hook and
now I'm proud to announce...

514
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,623
we have his children.

515
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:53,251
My God! Jack and Maggie.

516
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:57,756
Finally I'm going
to kill Peter Pan...

517
00:40:57,964 --> 00:41:02,552
that cocky boy who cut off
my hand and fed it to the crocodile!

518
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:06,723
And who killed that
cunning crocodile? Who stuffed him?

519
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,600
Who made him into a quiet clock?

520
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:11,812
Who went to the other world
and stole Pan's children?

521
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:14,857
And who didn't
believe I could do it?

522
00:41:15,566 --> 00:41:17,151
Who doubted me?

523
00:41:18,193 --> 00:41:20,487
Who amongst us does not belong?

524
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:22,990
Someone here does not belong.

525
00:41:23,198 --> 00:41:25,909
Stranger amongst the loyal,
I'll weed you out.

526
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:30,164
You!

527
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,920
You!

528
00:41:40,091 --> 00:41:41,842
Where's the carpet, Smee?

529
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,636
Sorry, sir.

530
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:47,598
You!

531
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:49,767
You! That's right, you!

532
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:52,270
No, not you! Not you.

533
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:54,689
You.

534
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:56,566
You!

535
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:03,030
You bet against me bringing
Pan back here, didn't you?

536
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,410
Tell your captain the truth.

537
00:42:11,456 --> 00:42:13,333
Say it. Say it.

538
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:15,543
I did.

539
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,712
- You made a boo-boo.
- I did.

540
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,217
- The Boo Box.
- Not the Boo Box!

541
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:40,777
Boo!

542
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:46,408
Put me down!

543
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:50,787
I want my mommy!
I want my daddy!

544
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:53,081
Hello, children.

545
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,667
Comfy? Cozy?

546
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:58,587
Those are my kids!

547
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:00,797
Those are my kids!

548
00:43:04,635 --> 00:43:07,262
Everything's gonna be all right.

549
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,390
It's all right. Daddy's here.

550
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:14,853
I want those kids out of that net
or you better get an attorney.

551
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,105
Who are you?

552
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:18,732
I'm Peter Banning.
I want my children.

553
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:20,192
Those are your...?

554
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:21,860
These are your children?

555
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:23,195
And you're...?

556
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,363
You're Peter?

557
00:43:24,571 --> 00:43:26,657
You're Peter? No!

558
00:43:27,366 --> 00:43:30,286
- You're Peter?
- Is there an echo in here? Yes!

559
00:43:30,494 --> 00:43:33,122
My great and worthy opponent?

560
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,459
Who is this impostor?

561
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,462
Peter flogging flying Pan!

562
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:43,966
I'm not Peter Pan.
I am just an ordinary....

563
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:46,344
I've got a sworn
affidavit by a T. Bell.

564
00:43:46,677 --> 00:43:50,222
I've got his medical history.
I even got his dental records.

565
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,559
Are you trying to
do me out of my job?

566
00:43:53,768 --> 00:43:56,062
May I show you something?
Will you let go?

567
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,396
Release him.

568
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:00,233
- May I show you this?
- Will you shut him up.

569
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,323
- Captain, put these on.
- I want to see the scar.

570
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:08,866
The hypertrophy.

571
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:13,037
Here's where you sliced him
during the Tiger Lily incident.

572
00:44:13,246 --> 00:44:14,414
That's my appendix!

573
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:15,665
What's this?

574
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:20,962
Faerie footprints. He's Peter Pan
or I've got a dead man's dinghy.

575
00:44:24,215 --> 00:44:26,092
Is it you?

576
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:29,846
My great and worthy opponent?

577
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:32,766
But it can't be.

578
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,311
Not this pitiful,
spineless, pasty, bloated...

579
00:44:36,603 --> 00:44:39,648
codfish I see before me.

580
00:44:40,148 --> 00:44:43,193
You're not even
a shadow of Peter Pan.

581
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,658
You have an obligation to
clarify this Pan problem.

582
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:50,700
This disaster.

583
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:52,786
- Which must be remedied.
- Expediently.

584
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:55,288
I want my children.
The stakes can be no higher.

585
00:44:55,497 --> 00:44:59,876
For me, sir, they could have
sunk no lower. And I want my war!

586
00:45:00,085 --> 00:45:01,753
Blow him out of the water!

587
00:45:02,254 --> 00:45:04,339
Daddy's handling this. It's okay.

588
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:07,176
Pick up your weapon.

589
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:13,515
How much?

590
00:45:22,483 --> 00:45:24,902
Hoist and raise the kiddies!

591
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:36,163
I'll make you a deal,
Mr. Chairman. Fly up there...

592
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:40,418
and touch the fingers of your
children, and I'll set them free.

593
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:41,794
I can't fly.

594
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:45,548
Explode out of there! Stop
this charade! Free your children!

595
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:51,596
I beg your pardon?

596
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:55,141
You must be joking.

597
00:45:56,893 --> 00:46:00,772
Peter Pan has a
real problem with heights.

598
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:03,691
I'm not Peter Pan.

599
00:46:03,983 --> 00:46:07,654
It's okay. Hang on, son.
I'm coming, sweetheart.

600
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:10,990
- Somebody give me a hand.
- I already have.

601
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,127
Save us, Daddy!

602
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:24,754
"Save me, Daddy!"

603
00:46:25,797 --> 00:46:29,551
We know who you are!
What new game is this, Peter? Fly!

604
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:31,720
Stop pretending!

605
00:46:34,848 --> 00:46:36,850
Fly! I know it's you!

606
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:45,400
Be the Pan you are. Fly!

607
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:47,486
Fly! Think a happy thought.

608
00:46:47,986 --> 00:46:51,865
Just touch our fingers
and we'll be able to go home.

609
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:56,036
Touch them, Peter, and
it's all been just a bad dream!

610
00:46:56,244 --> 00:46:58,747
Just reach out and touch them!

611
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,335
Flap your arm and fly!

612
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:07,297
Reach!

613
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:09,800
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.

614
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,434
I don't understand. Why doesn't
he fly? He's a fop Peter Pan!

615
00:47:18,642 --> 00:47:21,353
He's Peter Pan, all right, captain.

616
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:25,941
He's been away from Never Land so
long, his mind's been gentrified.

617
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,235
He's forgotten everything.

618
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:36,494
Please don't give up.

619
00:47:49,423 --> 00:47:51,092
I want to go home.

620
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,225
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
I have decided to cancel the war.

621
00:48:00,351 --> 00:48:03,396
He can't fly, but he can swim!

622
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:05,273
Kill them.

623
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,150
Kill them all.

624
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,069
Bring on the plank!

625
00:48:13,281 --> 00:48:17,368
And I never want to
hear the name Peter Pan again!

626
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:23,291
What about the name Hook? Do you
want to be remembered as a bully?

627
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,419
Or as the great warrior
who defeated a heroic Pan?

628
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:33,301
One week and I'll get him in shape,
and you can have your dirty old war.

629
00:48:34,052 --> 00:48:38,640
It's a trick, captain! Let me blast
that buzzing vixen to pixie hell!

630
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,271
You promised people
the war of the century.

631
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:48,025
Your whole life has been building
to this. Mortal combat, glory!

632
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:49,484
Hook versus Pan!

633
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,195
That is not Pan.

634
00:49:05,834 --> 00:49:06,877
Two days.

635
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:09,797
Four. Bare minimum
for a decent Pan.

636
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:11,673
Three. Final offer.

637
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:14,093
Done.

638
00:49:15,636 --> 00:49:17,638
And you'd better deliver, Miss Bell...

639
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:22,518
or no amount of clapping will bring
you back from where I will send you.

640
00:49:24,937 --> 00:49:25,855
Hear me, men.

641
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,108
I've decided that the so-called Pan...

642
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:32,737
will return in three days to commence
the arbitrament of the sword.

643
00:49:32,945 --> 00:49:34,113
Smee, translate.

644
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:36,198
In three days we'll have a war.

645
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:39,744
A battle between
good and evil, to the death.

646
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,085
Help me!

647
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:31,816
Snow!

648
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:37,029
What...?

649
00:51:37,863 --> 00:51:39,115
What?

650
00:51:51,836 --> 00:51:53,087
Help!

651
00:51:58,301 --> 00:51:59,344
Get me down!

652
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,725
Oh, you're alive!

653
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,477
Oh, get me down!

654
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:08,853
I believe!

655
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:11,231
Lost Boys! Lost Boys! Wake up!

656
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:19,781
Pan's back!

657
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:22,492
Lost Boys! Lost Boys! Wake up!

658
00:52:23,743 --> 00:52:25,620
That was my pillow!

659
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:28,331
I'm up.

660
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,919
Wake up, you sleepyheads!

661
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:36,590
Pan's back! Pan's back! Pan!

662
00:52:46,475 --> 00:52:47,726
Pan!

663
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:55,234
Who's the shrub?

664
00:52:56,818 --> 00:52:58,070
Bangerang!

665
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:08,372
That ain't Peter Pan.

666
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,540
He's old.

667
00:53:09,748 --> 00:53:10,874
He's fat!

668
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:12,751
Not so fat to me.

669
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:16,297
He's an old, fat grandpa man.

670
00:53:21,927 --> 00:53:23,179
Rufio!

671
00:53:31,729 --> 00:53:33,606
That is so dangerous.

672
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:40,279
That's enough!

673
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,573
Okay, mister. All right.

674
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:45,284
The show's over.
Put that thing away!

675
00:53:45,493 --> 00:53:48,121
Put it down before
you poke somebody's eye out.

676
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:51,749
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with that sword?

677
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:56,129
This is an insurance nightmare! What's
this? Lord of the Flies preschool?

678
00:53:56,754 --> 00:53:58,548
Where are your parents?

679
00:53:58,756 --> 00:54:00,633
Who's in charge here?

680
00:54:03,428 --> 00:54:07,390
No, Mr. Skunkhead-with-too-much-mousse,
you're just a punk kid.

681
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,684
I want to speak to a grownup!

682
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,770
All grownups are pirates!

683
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:12,812
Excuse me?

684
00:54:13,438 --> 00:54:15,315
We kill pirates.

685
00:54:16,566 --> 00:54:18,234
I'm not a pirate.

686
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:21,154
It so happens I am a lawyer.

687
00:54:22,197 --> 00:54:24,282
Kill the lawyer!

688
00:54:25,116 --> 00:54:27,202
I'm not that kind of lawyer.

689
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,227
I've been shot!

690
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:57,858
Help!

691
00:54:58,066 --> 00:55:00,152
Help me, somebody!

692
00:55:05,157 --> 00:55:07,576
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!

693
00:55:07,785 --> 00:55:10,162
Hook's kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.

694
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:12,790
We have to make him bangerang!

695
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,292
No, no! Please stop!

696
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,212
Why are you doing this to me?

697
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:22,049
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.
Please teach him.

698
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:24,552
We gotta make him remember.

699
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:38,649
Excuse me.

700
00:55:53,122 --> 00:55:54,374
Help me!

701
00:55:54,582 --> 00:55:56,459
Not you!

702
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:23,361
Oh, my! A wall.

703
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:37,125
Lost Boys, stop! Stop it!

704
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:44,967
Play!

705
00:56:46,718 --> 00:56:47,886
Play.

706
00:57:11,869 --> 00:57:15,080
You're dead, jolly man.

707
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:19,460
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.

708
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:22,588
Hook has got his kids,
and I've got three days...

709
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:26,133
to get him ready to fight.
And I need everybody's help.

710
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,679
Peter Pan's got kids?

711
00:57:37,186 --> 00:57:41,357
He can't fly, fight or crow.

712
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,405
If any of you says this here
scug ain't Peter Pan...

713
00:57:47,613 --> 00:57:48,865
cross the line.

714
00:57:56,164 --> 00:57:58,458
What? I'll be right back.

715
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:00,960
What?

716
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:03,463
You are embarrassing me!

717
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:19,582
Oh, there you are, Peter!

718
00:59:38,684 --> 00:59:40,019
But, Peter...

719
00:59:40,228 --> 00:59:44,190
you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.

720
00:59:48,903 --> 00:59:50,863
His nose got real big.

721
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:54,826
Well, welcome back to Never Land,
Pan the Man.

722
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:58,371
Don't listen to that faerie
and that brainless fungus!

723
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,291
I got Pan's sword! I'm the Pan now!

724
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:05,462
You think this guy's
gonna take it from me? Rufio?

725
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,884
Wait! If Tink believes, maybe he is.

726
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:21,311
Are you gonna follow this drooler
against Capitan Hook?

727
01:00:21,937 --> 01:00:26,733
What's he doing here if he's not Peter
Pan, huh? He don't look happy here.

728
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:30,070
And who are them kids Hook's got?
Give him a chance!

729
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:34,658
Those are my kids, and Hook's
gonna kill them unless we do something.

730
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:39,162
Help me. Please.

731
01:00:39,788 --> 01:00:42,374
Yeah, come on! Give him a chance!

732
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:50,924
Well, I should claw myself
with my own hook.

733
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:54,678
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance!

734
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,432
What have I done?
What have I done, Smee?

735
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:02,394
Agreed to a preposterous plan,
an absurd war.

736
01:01:02,603 --> 01:01:06,148
Now I'm bound by my
indefatigable good form to wait.

737
01:01:06,357 --> 01:01:09,276
- I'll fix you a nice plate.
- Wait for what?

738
01:01:09,485 --> 01:01:14,615
Whether it be three days or three
decades, he'll always be a fat, old Pan.

739
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:19,912
I hate being disappointed, Smee.
And I hate living in this flawed body!

740
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:22,540
And I hate living in Never Land!

741
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:24,917
And I hate, I hate...

742
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:29,505
I hate Peter Pan!

743
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:35,261
Smee? Smee?

744
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,057
I've just had a sublime vision.

745
01:01:44,645 --> 01:01:46,939
All the jagged parts of my life...

746
01:01:47,148 --> 01:01:51,819
have come together to form
a complete and mystical whole.

747
01:01:54,113 --> 01:01:55,573
An epiphany.

748
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:57,659
A " piphy" what?

749
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:00,787
My life is over.

750
01:02:00,995 --> 01:02:02,247
You've lost your appetite?

751
01:02:02,664 --> 01:02:04,124
Yes.

752
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:05,583
Goodbye.

753
01:02:07,043 --> 01:02:09,462
Where're you going?
Are you getting dramatic?

754
01:02:09,671 --> 01:02:10,797
Goodbye, Smee.

755
01:02:11,006 --> 01:02:13,925
Captain, why don't we
play with your island?

756
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:18,305
All the little lndians and
the soldiers and all the Lost Boys?

757
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:20,807
Here we go.

758
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:25,604
No stopping me this time, Smee.

759
01:02:25,812 --> 01:02:26,980
This is it.

760
01:02:27,189 --> 01:02:30,400
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.

761
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:34,696
My finger's on the trigger.
Don't try to stop me, Smee.

762
01:02:34,905 --> 01:02:36,156
Oh, not again.

763
01:02:36,365 --> 01:02:37,199
This is it.

764
01:02:37,491 --> 01:02:42,496
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.

765
01:02:42,704 --> 01:02:47,000
Don't you dare try to stop me
this time, Smee. Try to stop me.

766
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:51,255
You better get up off your ass.
Get over here!

767
01:02:51,463 --> 01:02:52,923
- I'm coming!
- Stop me!

768
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:56,593
This is not a joke!
I'm committing suicide!

769
01:03:00,764 --> 01:03:02,933
Don't ever frighten me like that again.

770
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:05,019
- Sorry.
- What are you, a sadist?

771
01:03:05,227 --> 01:03:07,104
I'm sorry. How do you feel now?

772
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,149
- I want to die.
- Oh, now, now.

773
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:13,152
- There's no adventure here.
- You call this " no adventure"?

774
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,654
Death is the only
great adventure I have left.

775
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,448
Let's get you into bed.

776
01:03:17,656 --> 01:03:18,783
It's all over.

777
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:22,244
- I'm so tired.
- Don't upset yourself, captain.

778
01:03:22,453 --> 01:03:25,039
My career is over.

779
01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:28,167
This was supposed to be the war
to end all wars.

780
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:31,420
- And it will be, captain.
- The ultimate war.

781
01:03:33,798 --> 01:03:37,552
There must be a way to get at him,
to get even with him...

782
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,471
to get him where
it really would hurt.

783
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,851
There must be something I haven't
thought of. Where is he vulnerable?

784
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:48,813
No more talk about
doing away with yourself.

785
01:03:49,022 --> 01:03:52,567
I mean, what would the world be like
without Captain Hook?

786
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:55,278
Indeed. Good form, Smee.

787
01:03:55,695 --> 01:04:00,074
- What would the world be like without me?
- There you go.

788
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:02,160
I'm ready for my nightcap.

789
01:04:02,368 --> 01:04:05,080
Abso-flogging-lutely.

790
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:07,916
I think a bit of skulduggery
would do you good.

791
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:10,919
Take your mind off this Pan business.

792
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:15,090
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll
shoot some lndians out at Long Tom.

793
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:19,052
I'm tired of killing lndians
and Lost Boys. I always kill them.

794
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:22,097
I want to kill Peter Pan.
I wanna kill him!

795
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:24,891
Hear me? I want to kill him.

796
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,768
Oh, dear.

797
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:37,529
I've just had an apostrophe.

798
01:04:37,738 --> 01:04:39,698
I think you mean an "epiphany."

799
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:43,160
Lightning has just struck my brain.

800
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,120
Well, that must hurt.

801
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:48,248
- Pan's kids....
- What about them?

802
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:54,421
You could make them like you.

803
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:56,382
Say, what?

804
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,676
No, no, no.

805
01:05:03,389 --> 01:05:07,017
We could make
the little buggers love you.

806
01:05:07,852 --> 01:05:10,771
No little children love me.

807
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,316
- Captain, that is the point.
- What do you mean?

808
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:17,570
That is the ultimate revenge.

809
01:05:17,778 --> 01:05:20,573
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.

810
01:05:20,781 --> 01:05:22,241
What're you getting on about?

811
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,535
- It's the ultimate payback.
- What is?

812
01:05:24,744 --> 01:05:25,995
Imagine Pan...

813
01:05:26,203 --> 01:05:29,540
when he faces you, and his kids...

814
01:05:29,749 --> 01:05:31,209
standing beside you...

815
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:36,339
ready to fight for the sleaziest
sleaze of the seven seas, Captain Hook.

816
01:05:36,547 --> 01:05:40,176
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, I see.

817
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:42,053
You know, Smee...

818
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:46,015
I like it, I like it, I like it!

819
01:05:46,224 --> 01:05:49,143
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea
I've just had!

820
01:05:49,352 --> 01:05:52,897
Tomorrow, I'll make Pan's brats love me.

821
01:05:53,106 --> 01:05:56,234
Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.

822
01:05:56,442 --> 01:06:00,196
And if he doesn't, those dirty
Lost Boys will jog his memory.

823
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:04,784
Oh, yes, you'll see.
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly...

824
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:07,912
and then, he'll die.

825
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,757
{y:i}Pick 'em up

826
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:20,425
{y:i}Move 'em down

827
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:22,094
{y:i}Pick 'em on up

828
01:06:22,302 --> 01:06:24,096
{y:i}Move 'em on down

829
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:27,307
{y:i}Ain't no time to celebrate

830
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:30,644
{y:i}You are old and overweight

831
01:06:30,978 --> 01:06:33,981
{y:i}Gotta lose a million pounds

832
01:06:34,189 --> 01:06:38,777
{y:i}Get your fat butt off the ground
{y:i}Reach on down and touch your toes

833
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:42,322
{y:i}How long since you looked at those?

834
01:06:42,656 --> 01:06:43,907
{y:i}Shape up

835
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:45,659
{y:i}Lose weight

836
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,119
{y:i}Get thin

837
01:06:47,327 --> 01:06:48,162
{y:i}Gotta win

838
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:53,167
{y:i}Jumping jacks are good for you
{y:i}Now your face is turning blue

839
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,420
{y:i}Swing your arms around your back

840
01:06:56,629 --> 01:06:59,632
{y:i}Give yourself a heart attack
{y:i}Gotta train

841
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,425
{y:i}In the rain

842
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:02,968
{y:i}In the sun

843
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:04,762
{y:i}In the snow

844
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:07,139
{y:i}Ten below
{y:i}Gotta move

845
01:07:07,348 --> 01:07:09,141
{y:i}Gotta do
{y:i}Gotta grow

846
01:07:11,102 --> 01:07:13,187
Go easy on me. I'm a beginner.

847
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,563
Low! High! High!

848
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,320
All right, gramps.
Give it your best shot.

849
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:23,948
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen. Learn.

850
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,534
Okay, you ready?
I don't wanna hurt you.

851
01:07:30,705 --> 01:07:32,165
Watch your skin!

852
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:33,750
Be bangerang, old man.

853
01:07:46,971 --> 01:07:50,225
What are you doing? How does this
help me get my kids back?

854
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:51,893
What do I have to do next?

855
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:56,564
Next, time to fly.

856
01:08:02,737 --> 01:08:06,366
Just think happy thoughts.

857
01:08:06,574 --> 01:08:10,537
All you need is one happy thought,
Peter, and it'll make you fly.

858
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,039
I got it!

859
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:17,335
Not being in this slingshot
would make me very happy!

860
01:08:19,212 --> 01:08:20,672
He's going up!

861
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:23,258
He's coming down!

862
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:30,349
Now, pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.

863
01:08:30,557 --> 01:08:35,354
"Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children."

864
01:08:37,856 --> 01:08:39,107
Anyone?

865
01:08:39,942 --> 01:08:42,361
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?

866
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:46,824
You, the cute little urchin
in the front row....

867
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:51,120
Won't you share your thoughts
with the whole class?

868
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:52,162
Yes.

869
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:55,165
I said Mommy reads to us every night...

870
01:08:55,374 --> 01:08:57,876
because she loves us very much.

871
01:08:58,085 --> 01:08:59,753
Loves you?
Isn't that....

872
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,090
The "L" word, captain.

873
01:09:03,924 --> 01:09:04,758
No, child.

874
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:09,764
Your mother reads to you every night
in order to stupefy you to sleep...

875
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:14,060
so that she and Daddy can sit down
for three minutes without you...

876
01:09:14,268 --> 01:09:19,357
and your mindless, inexhaustible,
unstoppable, repetitive demands:

877
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:21,234
"He took my toy."

878
01:09:21,442 --> 01:09:22,693
"She hid my bear."

879
01:09:22,902 --> 01:09:26,864
"I want to potty. I want a cookie.
I want to stay up."

880
01:09:27,073 --> 01:09:29,700
"I want, I want, I want!"
"Me, me, me, me!"

881
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:31,869
"Mine, mine, mine, mine!"

882
01:09:32,078 --> 01:09:34,997
"Now, now, now!"

883
01:09:35,206 --> 01:09:38,126
Can't you understand, child?

884
01:09:38,543 --> 01:09:42,714
- They tell you stories to shut you up.
- And conk you out.

885
01:09:42,922 --> 01:09:46,593
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!

886
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:49,179
Lie? Me?

887
01:09:51,055 --> 01:09:52,724
Never!

888
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:56,686
The truth is far too much fun.

889
01:09:59,397 --> 01:10:04,527
Before you were born, your parents
would stay up all night together...

890
01:10:04,819 --> 01:10:06,488
just to see the sunrise.

891
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:07,739
Don't be frightened.

892
01:10:07,948 --> 01:10:13,161
Maggie, before you were born,
they were happier.

893
01:10:13,787 --> 01:10:15,580
They were free.

894
01:10:16,498 --> 01:10:19,209
You are a bad man.

895
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:21,294
Smee, flunk the maggot.

896
01:10:21,503 --> 01:10:23,088
Abso-flogging-lutely.

897
01:10:23,296 --> 01:10:25,048
An "F"?

898
01:10:27,759 --> 01:10:29,845
He gave me an "F"!

899
01:10:32,347 --> 01:10:35,475
Your father went to your sister's
school play, did he not?

900
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,646
But did he go to your baseball game?

901
01:10:42,274 --> 01:10:43,817
How'd you know about that?

902
01:10:44,026 --> 01:10:48,614
He missed the most important game
on the most important day...

903
01:10:48,822 --> 01:10:51,116
of your young life.

904
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:54,995
- I wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.

905
01:10:55,204 --> 01:10:57,706
I hate, I hate you, Mr. Hook!

906
01:10:58,415 --> 01:11:01,544
What did I tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.

907
01:11:01,752 --> 01:11:03,003
Of course they do.

908
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:05,631
Come on.
You're depressing the captain.

909
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,094
Jack, listen to me! Never let him
make you forget! Never forget...

910
01:11:10,302 --> 01:11:11,762
Mommy and Daddy!

911
01:11:11,971 --> 01:11:15,308
Think of a way to run home, Jack!
Run home!

912
01:11:15,516 --> 01:11:16,767
Run home?

913
01:11:20,938 --> 01:11:22,815
You are home.

914
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:26,778
Right?

915
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:43,878
Oh, yeah.

916
01:12:10,572 --> 01:12:13,074
No, no, no.
We don't use them.

917
01:12:13,283 --> 01:12:16,828
- Why do you have them?
- So we don't have to use them.

918
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:19,748
Don't crowd me!

919
01:12:20,082 --> 01:12:21,541
Come on, Thud Butt!

920
01:12:33,637 --> 01:12:34,763
Everybody say grace.

921
01:12:34,972 --> 01:12:35,806
Bless this, Lord...

922
01:12:36,014 --> 01:12:37,683
Grace!

923
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:48,944
All of my favourite Never Foods!

924
01:12:49,153 --> 01:12:53,240
Yams, mamey apples and banana squash!

925
01:12:53,532 --> 01:12:57,703
Wash it down, calabash and papaw!

926
01:13:01,874 --> 01:13:03,542
Can you blow on this?

927
01:13:04,376 --> 01:13:05,211
Thank you.

928
01:13:30,153 --> 01:13:32,030
This is good!

929
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,419
Are you eating that?

930
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:50,465
No, please.

931
01:13:51,424 --> 01:13:52,467
Eat!

932
01:13:52,759 --> 01:13:54,844
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?

933
01:13:55,053 --> 01:13:59,349
If you can't imagine yourself being
Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!

934
01:13:59,557 --> 01:14:02,477
Eat what? There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.

935
01:14:02,686 --> 01:14:04,854
This used to be your favourite game.

936
01:14:05,063 --> 01:14:07,983
Forget the games. I want real food!
Steak, eggs...

937
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:12,988
You can't. Eat your heart out,
you crinkled, wrinkled fat bag!

938
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:16,032
- You're very ill-mannered...
- You're a slug-eating worm.

939
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:17,576
You can do better than that!

940
01:14:17,993 --> 01:14:19,036
You're encouraging them?

941
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:24,041
Show me your fastball, dust brain!
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!

942
01:14:24,249 --> 01:14:26,335
Bangerang, Rufio!

943
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:29,463
You're a very poor role model
for these kids, you know?

944
01:14:32,799 --> 01:14:34,802
You don't have
a fourth-grade reading level.

945
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:38,013
- Haemorrhoidal sucknavel.
- Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.

946
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:44,687
Oil-dripping, beef-fart
sniffing bubble butt.

947
01:14:46,772 --> 01:14:49,066
Someone has a severe caca mouth.
You know that?

948
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,943
You are a fart factory!

949
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:54,697
Slug-slime sack
of rat guts and cat vomit...

950
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:56,157
cheesy scab...

951
01:14:56,365 --> 01:14:58,659
picked pimple-squeezing
finger bandage!

952
01:14:58,868 --> 01:15:04,081
A week-old maggot burger with
everything on it and flies on the side!

953
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:07,835
Substitute chemistry teacher.

954
01:15:08,044 --> 01:15:10,338
Come on, Rufio, hit him back.

955
01:15:11,088 --> 01:15:11,923
Mung tongue!

956
01:15:13,257 --> 01:15:15,343
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.

957
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,553
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.

958
01:15:17,762 --> 01:15:18,888
Nearsighted gynaecologist.

959
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:21,724
- In your face, camelcake!
- In your rear, cow derrière!

960
01:15:21,933 --> 01:15:23,893
Lying, crying, spying,
prying ultra-pig!

961
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,104
Lewd, crude bag
of pre-chewed food dude.

962
01:15:26,312 --> 01:15:27,980
Bangerang, Peter!

963
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,611
You man! Stupid, stupid man!

964
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:36,614
If I'm a maggot burger,
why don't you just eat me?

965
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,119
You zebra-headed, slime-coated,
pimple-farming, paramecium brain...

966
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:45,081
munching on your own mucus,
suffering from Peter Pan envy!

967
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,749
What's a " paramecium brain"?

968
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:49,878
I'll tell you what a paramecium is!
That's a paramecium!

969
01:15:50,086 --> 01:15:53,423
It's a one-celled critter
with no brain that can't fly!

970
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:56,426
Don't mess with me, man!
I'm a lawyer!

971
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,428
Banning, Banning!

972
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,936
Rufio! Rufio!

973
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:16,238
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just
go suck on a dead dog's nose?

974
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,039
You're doing it.

975
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:30,419
- Doing what?
- Using your imagination, Peter.

976
01:16:56,487 --> 01:17:01,701
You're playing with us, Peter.
You're doing it, Peter.

977
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:25,058
Drink your papaw, Peter.

978
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:27,977
How is it?

979
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,480
Bangerang.

980
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,234
Catch!

981
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:43,409
Hey, Pockets...

982
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:44,869
catch!

983
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:47,789
Oh, Don't Ask!

984
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,638
Bangerang!

985
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,648
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!

986
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:15,025
Peter, look out!

987
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:16,068
Peter, watch out!

988
01:18:48,684 --> 01:18:50,477
Bangerang.

989
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:07,870
Peter...

990
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,164
can I talk to you?

991
01:19:10,373 --> 01:19:12,041
Sure, Thud.

992
01:19:13,501 --> 01:19:15,795
- I remember Tootles.
- You do?

993
01:19:16,003 --> 01:19:17,463
He was lost too.

994
01:19:18,297 --> 01:19:19,882
How could you know Tootles?

995
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:22,385
He was a Lost Boy.

996
01:19:22,677 --> 01:19:24,971
These are his marbles.

997
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:29,350
These are his happy thoughts.

998
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:40,820
- He really did lose his marbles.
- Yeah, he lost them good.

999
01:19:43,114 --> 01:19:44,991
Peter, you know what?

1000
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,119
My happy thought will help you.

1001
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:50,622
What's your happy thought?

1002
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:53,959
Mine's my mother.

1003
01:19:54,584 --> 01:19:57,420
Do you remember your mother, Peter?

1004
01:19:57,921 --> 01:19:59,381
Wish I could.

1005
01:20:01,591 --> 01:20:03,343
Listen.

1006
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:21,069
My mom sang that song.

1007
01:20:21,278 --> 01:20:24,615
My young Jack, tell me
about the game of baseball.

1008
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:29,620
I can't remember. Are the mates
standing or are they on horseback?

1009
01:20:31,705 --> 01:20:36,627
{y:i}The stars are all my friends

1010
01:20:36,835 --> 01:20:40,673
{y:i}Till the nighttime ends

1011
01:20:40,881 --> 01:20:44,843
{y:i}So I know I'm not alone

1012
01:20:45,386 --> 01:20:49,223
{y:i}When I'm here on my own

1013
01:20:50,266 --> 01:20:54,145
{y:i}Isn't that a wonder

1014
01:20:54,854 --> 01:20:58,190
{y:i}When you're alone

1015
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:02,778
{y:i}You're not alone

1016
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:08,201
{y:i}Not really alone

1017
01:21:52,537 --> 01:21:55,540
Good night, Never Land!

1018
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:36,415
What is it? I hear it.
I hear it again.

1019
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,711
Smee, it's that crocodile,
back from the dead!

1020
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:46,133
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock!

1021
01:22:46,342 --> 01:22:48,219
Is that the clock?

1022
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:54,058
You killed that croc years ago.
We smash every clock we find.

1023
01:22:54,266 --> 01:22:56,435
Little elf didn't know any better.

1024
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:00,815
To the museum, at once.

1025
01:23:14,787 --> 01:23:19,584
Shine 'em up! Put a fresh coat of
varnish on your peg, right here!

1026
01:23:32,931 --> 01:23:34,808
Broken clocks....

1027
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:39,813
Each one ticked its last tock,
and now all is well.

1028
01:23:40,772 --> 01:23:42,107
Just listen.

1029
01:23:42,315 --> 01:23:43,983
I don't hear anything.

1030
01:23:44,401 --> 01:23:47,654
I know! Good form! Exactly!

1031
01:23:47,862 --> 01:23:50,782
Jack, you see this? Come over here.

1032
01:23:50,991 --> 01:23:52,117
You can take it.

1033
01:23:52,325 --> 01:23:56,830
This is Barbecue's very own bedside
clock. He was quite an infamous pirate.

1034
01:23:57,038 --> 01:24:00,792
I smashed this clock
immediately after I gutted him.

1035
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,961
His ship made a pretty bonfire!

1036
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:06,089
Such a pretty, pretty....

1037
01:24:12,137 --> 01:24:15,265
What is that I hear?

1038
01:24:16,934 --> 01:24:18,393
A ticking?

1039
01:24:21,021 --> 01:24:22,981
Smee, stop the ticking!

1040
01:24:23,732 --> 01:24:26,527
Stop that! Stop that "tick-tick"!

1041
01:24:27,152 --> 01:24:30,072
There's no ticking here.
There's nothing left to tick.

1042
01:24:31,865 --> 01:24:34,034
Oh, my God!

1043
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:39,039
This is for the ticking
that might have been.

1044
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:41,959
Get his father's watch!

1045
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,338
Go on.

1046
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:48,340
You know you want to.

1047
01:24:48,632 --> 01:24:50,301
Give it a try.

1048
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:52,595
Go on.

1049
01:24:52,803 --> 01:24:54,472
This is for...

1050
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:57,933
never letting me blow bubbles
in my chocolate milk!

1051
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:03,564
- Good form! Bravo!
- Isn't that wonderful?

1052
01:25:03,773 --> 01:25:07,109
This is for never letting me
jump on my own bed!

1053
01:25:08,152 --> 01:25:11,072
Make time stand still, laddie.

1054
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,909
For always making promises
and breaking them!

1055
01:25:15,118 --> 01:25:17,412
For never doing anything with me.

1056
01:25:18,997 --> 01:25:21,791
For a father who's never there, Jack?

1057
01:25:24,502 --> 01:25:28,673
Jack, for a father who
didn't save you on the ship.

1058
01:25:29,299 --> 01:25:31,384
Who wouldn't save us....

1059
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:33,803
Who couldn't save you, Jack.

1060
01:25:34,304 --> 01:25:37,223
He wouldn't. He didn't even try.

1061
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:41,394
He was there, we were there,
and he wouldn't try.

1062
01:25:44,022 --> 01:25:45,774
Jack...

1063
01:25:45,982 --> 01:25:47,233
he will try.

1064
01:25:49,027 --> 01:25:51,196
And the question will be:

1065
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:55,075
When the time comes,
do you want to be saved?

1066
01:25:56,409 --> 01:25:58,495
Now, don't you answer now.
No, no, no, no.

1067
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:02,874
Now it's time to be
whatever you want to be.

1068
01:26:04,042 --> 01:26:06,420
Put behind you any thoughts of home...

1069
01:26:06,753 --> 01:26:09,548
that place of broken promises.

1070
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:11,633
That what?

1071
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,013
Have I ever made a promise, Jack...

1072
01:26:16,346 --> 01:26:19,558
l have not kept?

1073
01:26:22,269 --> 01:26:23,937
Have l, son?

1074
01:26:52,216 --> 01:26:53,968
Come on. Let's go!

1075
01:27:03,352 --> 01:27:04,520
I don't like this game.

1076
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:07,732
"Steal Hook's hook
As fast as you can."

1077
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,817
"It'll make you proud."

1078
01:27:10,234 --> 01:27:13,071
"Then you crow like Pan."

1079
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,533
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.

1080
01:27:24,415 --> 01:27:27,544
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.

1081
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:35,051
Steal Hook's hook, then crow!

1082
01:27:55,197 --> 01:27:56,740
Jackie, boy! Jack!

1083
01:27:57,699 --> 01:28:00,911
This is for all the games
your daddy missed.

1084
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:03,955
Hook would never miss your game, son.

1085
01:28:04,164 --> 01:28:05,624
You're almost there. Take it.

1086
01:28:05,916 --> 01:28:09,253
- What's he looking at?
- Come on, you're this close!

1087
01:28:09,586 --> 01:28:10,921
What's wrong?

1088
01:28:11,129 --> 01:28:13,423
- Grab it, come on.
- Grab it, Peter!

1089
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,134
Come on, Jack.

1090
01:28:17,177 --> 01:28:18,637
And one!

1091
01:28:31,066 --> 01:28:33,027
Wait for the good pitches.

1092
01:28:33,235 --> 01:28:35,029
Wait for the good pitches!

1093
01:28:41,702 --> 01:28:45,664
Jack! Jack! He's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can!

1094
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:48,667
He's stealing second!

1095
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:55,132
No, now stop it!

1096
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:59,220
We're playing this game according
to Master Jack's rules! Bad form!

1097
01:28:59,512 --> 01:29:02,014
Sit down now! Let's resume the game!

1098
01:29:02,223 --> 01:29:04,308
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?

1099
01:29:09,313 --> 01:29:10,773
Come on, Jack!

1100
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:14,110
Run home, Jack! Run home, Jack!

1101
01:29:21,618 --> 01:29:23,286
"Run home, Jack."

1102
01:29:23,494 --> 01:29:27,457
Smee, no, no, no!
They've got it backwards!

1103
01:29:27,665 --> 01:29:29,334
Tell them to turn it around!

1104
01:29:29,667 --> 01:29:30,919
Maggie?

1105
01:29:31,628 --> 01:29:33,088
Switch!

1106
01:29:38,093 --> 01:29:41,763
Home run, Jack! Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack!

1107
01:29:42,472 --> 01:29:44,975
Home run, Jack. Home run, Jack.

1108
01:29:53,316 --> 01:29:55,193
He can't hit the curve.

1109
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:22,721
My Jack!

1110
01:30:24,932 --> 01:30:26,058
My Jack.

1111
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,362
You did it! Hoist him up!

1112
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:46,078
That's my boy! You did it, son!

1113
01:31:23,825 --> 01:31:24,868
Gotta fly!

1114
01:31:25,827 --> 01:31:27,078
Happy thought.

1115
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:31,541
Happy thought, happy thought,
happy thought, happy....

1116
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:34,252
One great, big happy thought!

1117
01:31:34,669 --> 01:31:36,129
Less is more.

1118
01:31:38,632 --> 01:31:39,883
I can...!

1119
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:15,188
"Tootles. Wendy. John.

1120
01:33:15,396 --> 01:33:18,024
Michael. Peter."

1121
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:44,593
Be careful, Peter. You're
a lot taller than you used to be.

1122
01:33:45,844 --> 01:33:47,512
Well, say something.

1123
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:51,683
Do you like my dress?

1124
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,273
You look beautiful.

1125
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:05,656
What's the occasion?

1126
01:34:06,198 --> 01:34:07,324
You are.

1127
01:34:08,367 --> 01:34:10,244
It's a welcome-home party.

1128
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:17,543
What happened here?

1129
01:34:17,751 --> 01:34:19,003
Hook.

1130
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:21,088
Burnt it when you didn't come back.

1131
01:34:42,068 --> 01:34:43,402
Kiss.

1132
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:50,284
Wendy.

1133
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:55,289
This is Wendy's house.

1134
01:34:55,498 --> 01:34:57,583
Tootles and Nibs built it for her.

1135
01:35:00,628 --> 01:35:02,171
I remember.

1136
01:35:04,257 --> 01:35:06,050
Wendy would sit in that chair.

1137
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:09,887
But it wasn't there. It was here.

1138
01:35:11,055 --> 01:35:14,684
We used to sit here while
she'd darn socks and tell us stories.

1139
01:35:15,935 --> 01:35:17,604
She slept here.

1140
01:35:18,354 --> 01:35:20,315
Tink, your apartment was right here.

1141
01:35:20,523 --> 01:35:21,774
Yes.

1142
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,362
Little Michael in his basket bed,
right here.

1143
01:35:27,322 --> 01:35:28,573
John.

1144
01:35:36,706 --> 01:35:39,834
Teddy. My Teddy.

1145
01:35:44,923 --> 01:35:48,051
Mother used to put him in the pram
to keep me company.

1146
01:35:53,682 --> 01:35:55,684
I remember my mother.

1147
01:35:56,935 --> 01:35:58,687
I remember her.

1148
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:04,318
You can be sure,
very fine schools indeed.

1149
01:36:04,943 --> 01:36:08,697
First, he will attend Whitehall,
then Oxford.

1150
01:36:08,906 --> 01:36:09,865
And of course...

1151
01:36:10,073 --> 01:36:15,079
after graduation, he will prepare
for a judgeship in the highest court...

1152
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:19,875
making time for marriage
and family and all of that.

1153
01:36:20,084 --> 01:36:21,418
Just like his father.

1154
01:36:21,627 --> 01:36:24,255
{y:i}Isn't that what grownups
{y:i}want for their children?

1155
01:36:24,463 --> 01:36:26,549
{y:i}I was afraid.
{y:i}I didn't wanna grow up.

1156
01:36:26,757 --> 01:36:29,760
{y:i}Everybody who grows up
{y:i}has to die someday.

1157
01:36:30,094 --> 01:36:31,846
{y:i}So I ran away.

1158
01:36:42,481 --> 01:36:43,733
{y:i}Tink...

1159
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:47,278
{y:i}...you came and you saved me.

1160
01:36:47,904 --> 01:36:51,866
{y:i}You brought me to Never Land.
{y:i}You taught me to fly.

1161
01:36:54,702 --> 01:36:58,956
{y:i}But I was still a little boy,
{y:i}and I missed my mother.

1162
01:36:59,373 --> 01:37:02,710
{y:i}So I decided to fly home
{y:i}to my very own window.

1163
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:04,587
{y:i}But it was shut.

1164
01:37:06,047 --> 01:37:07,423
{y:i}They'd forgotten about me.

1165
01:37:12,011 --> 01:37:16,891
{y:i}I found other windows to visit,
{y:i}ones that weren't shut closed on me.

1166
01:37:17,517 --> 01:37:21,062
{y:i}That's how I met Wendy.
{y:i}I chased my shadow in her nursery.

1167
01:37:21,271 --> 01:37:25,650
{y:i}I expected my shadow and I would
{y:i}join together like drops of water.

1168
01:37:36,202 --> 01:37:37,746
Boy!

1169
01:37:40,457 --> 01:37:42,250
Why are you crying?

1170
01:37:44,628 --> 01:37:46,213
What's your name?

1171
01:37:47,339 --> 01:37:51,093
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?

1172
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:55,681
{y:i}I came back many times for Wendy.
{y:i}Always in the spring.

1173
01:37:58,517 --> 01:38:00,686
{y:i}And Wendy kept getting older...

1174
01:38:01,311 --> 01:38:02,354
{y:i}...and older.

1175
01:38:02,688 --> 01:38:06,525
{y:i}And then I came back the last time.

1176
01:38:06,859 --> 01:38:11,947
Peter, I can't come with you.
I've forgotten how to fly.

1177
01:38:13,115 --> 01:38:15,284
I'm old, Peter.

1178
01:38:16,243 --> 01:38:18,621
Ever so much more than 20.

1179
01:38:19,455 --> 01:38:22,082
- I grew up a long time ago.
- No, no, no!

1180
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:24,460
- You promised!
- I have children of my own now.

1181
01:38:24,793 --> 01:38:27,296
They have children of their own.

1182
01:38:27,505 --> 01:38:31,967
That's my grandchild, Moira,
asleep in the bed.

1183
01:38:32,301 --> 01:38:34,387
{y:i}When I saw her lying there sleeping...

1184
01:38:34,595 --> 01:38:37,598
{y:i}...at that moment,
{y:i}something changed in me forever.

1185
01:38:37,807 --> 01:38:39,892
I shall give her a kiss.

1186
01:38:41,268 --> 01:38:44,480
No! No, Peter!
No buttons, no thimbles.

1187
01:38:44,689 --> 01:38:49,068
I couldn't bear her heart to be broken
when she finds she can't keep you.

1188
01:38:51,571 --> 01:38:52,613
No.

1189
01:38:54,282 --> 01:38:57,326
I mean a real kiss.

1190
01:39:21,184 --> 01:39:24,312
I can see why you have trouble
finding a happy thought.

1191
01:39:25,772 --> 01:39:28,483
So many sad memories, Peter.

1192
01:39:30,151 --> 01:39:31,820
Bye, Teddy.

1193
01:39:33,905 --> 01:39:37,158
Not Teddy. Daddy!

1194
01:39:37,993 --> 01:39:39,119
Daddy!

1195
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:44,958
Peter, you're a daddy.

1196
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:49,755
Hi, Jack.

1197
01:39:49,963 --> 01:39:53,300
{y:i}I know why I came back.
{y:i}I know why I grew up.

1198
01:39:54,134 --> 01:39:57,054
{y:i}I wanted to be a father.

1199
01:39:57,471 --> 01:39:59,139
I'm a daddy.

1200
01:40:01,558 --> 01:40:03,227
My happy thought.

1201
01:40:04,144 --> 01:40:05,395
I got it!

1202
01:40:05,604 --> 01:40:08,107
I got it! I found it!

1203
01:40:10,526 --> 01:40:11,360
I lost it!

1204
01:40:13,112 --> 01:40:15,823
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!

1205
01:40:43,142 --> 01:40:44,810
Peter Pan!

1206
01:41:12,046 --> 01:41:13,923
He's back! He's back!

1207
01:41:14,132 --> 01:41:15,675
He's back!

1208
01:42:10,105 --> 01:42:11,148
Play!

1209
01:42:11,482 --> 01:42:13,025
Play!

1210
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,638
You are the Pan.

1211
01:43:03,409 --> 01:43:07,455
You can fly, you can fight,
and you can...

1212
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:56,255
Tink, you in there?

1213
01:44:00,008 --> 01:44:01,176
Are you sad?

1214
01:44:01,385 --> 01:44:03,470
No, I'm neither. Please go away.

1215
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:05,013
Oh, you're sick.

1216
01:44:05,556 --> 01:44:07,307
You need a Band-Aid.
Or a thermometer!

1217
01:44:07,516 --> 01:44:10,144
That's how Nibs made
the Wendy lady better.

1218
01:44:10,352 --> 01:44:12,938
Oh, no, Peter! It's not about that!

1219
01:44:13,147 --> 01:44:13,981
Yes, it is!

1220
01:44:14,189 --> 01:44:16,901
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.

1221
01:44:17,943 --> 01:44:19,403
Felt all better.

1222
01:44:21,906 --> 01:44:23,699
Don't we have
the greatest adventures?

1223
01:44:25,576 --> 01:44:28,996
Do you remember your next
great adventure to save your kids?

1224
01:44:29,747 --> 01:44:31,290
Kids?

1225
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:34,543
Peter Pan's got kids?

1226
01:44:35,795 --> 01:44:37,129
Why are you in Never Land?

1227
01:44:37,338 --> 01:44:39,423
To always be a little boy and have fun.

1228
01:44:39,632 --> 01:44:42,552
I like this game. Ask me another one.

1229
01:44:56,941 --> 01:44:58,735
Oh, dear me! I did it.

1230
01:44:58,943 --> 01:45:02,780
Tink, look what happened!
You broke your house.

1231
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,285
You're humongous.

1232
01:45:09,454 --> 01:45:12,373
This is the only wish
I ever wished for myself.

1233
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:16,544
This is the biggest
feeling I've ever, ever felt.

1234
01:45:16,753 --> 01:45:21,758
And this is the first time
I've been big enough to have it.

1235
01:45:22,592 --> 01:45:26,137
Peter, I wanna give you a kiss.

1236
01:45:29,683 --> 01:45:31,977
No, I mean a real kiss.

1237
01:45:37,607 --> 01:45:39,693
I love you, Peter Pan.

1238
01:45:40,318 --> 01:45:42,195
I love...

1239
01:45:42,404 --> 01:45:43,238
her.

1240
01:45:43,447 --> 01:45:45,115
"Her," who?

1241
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:47,618
Mo...

1242
01:45:47,826 --> 01:45:48,785
Moira!

1243
01:45:49,202 --> 01:45:51,163
I love Moira...

1244
01:45:52,122 --> 01:45:54,625
and Jack and Maggie.

1245
01:45:58,253 --> 01:45:59,713
Jack and Maggie....

1246
01:46:05,344 --> 01:46:07,429
I have a plan. Tink?

1247
01:46:08,681 --> 01:46:09,932
Come on. You gotta come.

1248
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,728
When it's all over, you'll leave
and never come back again.

1249
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:22,236
What are you staring at, Peter?

1250
01:46:23,487 --> 01:46:24,947
Save them.

1251
01:46:25,573 --> 01:46:27,033
Go save them.

1252
01:46:30,161 --> 01:46:31,412
You silly ass, go!

1253
01:47:12,704 --> 01:47:17,083
Jack, it's a very special time when
a pirate receives his first earring.

1254
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:22,422
It's like the first time you
run someone through with your blade.

1255
01:47:25,008 --> 01:47:25,842
Now, Jack...

1256
01:47:26,051 --> 01:47:29,721
I'm gonna ask you to bend
your head ever so slightly.

1257
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:32,307
A little more. That's it.

1258
01:47:32,516 --> 01:47:36,395
And brace yourself, lad.
Because this...

1259
01:47:36,603 --> 01:47:38,980
is really going to hurt.

1260
01:47:47,948 --> 01:47:50,242
Smee, what is that?

1261
01:48:01,211 --> 01:48:03,172
Who is that, captain?

1262
01:48:07,134 --> 01:48:08,928
It's Peter Pan.

1263
01:48:09,219 --> 01:48:11,722
Has it been three days?

1264
01:48:12,348 --> 01:48:13,807
'Tis true, Peter...

1265
01:48:14,016 --> 01:48:16,519
time does fly.

1266
01:48:18,187 --> 01:48:20,815
And so do you, I see.

1267
01:48:21,232 --> 01:48:26,112
How did you ever manage to fit
into those smashing tights again, Peter?

1268
01:48:29,782 --> 01:48:32,577
Hand over my son now
and you and your men may go free.

1269
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:37,999
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?
Jack, someone to see you, son.

1270
01:48:41,752 --> 01:48:44,672
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.

1271
01:48:44,881 --> 01:48:46,466
I am home.

1272
01:48:47,592 --> 01:48:48,968
Good form!

1273
01:48:49,469 --> 01:48:53,431
You see, Peter, he is my son.
He loves me dearly.

1274
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:56,768
And I'm prepared to fight
dearly for him.

1275
01:48:56,976 --> 01:49:00,522
I've waited long to shake your hand
with this.

1276
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:03,441
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom!

1277
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,569
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.

1278
01:49:37,851 --> 01:49:42,564
Don't you love it, laddie? Once you've
shed blood, it's hard to stop!

1279
01:49:42,773 --> 01:49:45,150
It's a pirate's life, my lad!

1280
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:47,236
Jack, Jack!

1281
01:49:47,569 --> 01:49:50,906
- Don't I know him?
- No, you've never seen him before!

1282
01:49:52,658 --> 01:49:55,702
You won't believe this,
but I found my happy thought.

1283
01:49:55,911 --> 01:49:59,039
It took me three days,
then guess what happened?

1284
01:49:59,248 --> 01:50:00,791
Up I went!

1285
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,294
You know what my happy thought was?

1286
01:50:07,673 --> 01:50:09,341
It was you.

1287
01:50:19,143 --> 01:50:22,813
That's my dad... but he hates to fly!

1288
01:50:23,022 --> 01:50:25,107
Bangerang!

1289
01:51:04,814 --> 01:51:07,525
Call out the militia!
We'll need every last man!

1290
01:51:16,284 --> 01:51:21,206
If there's anybody not fighting,
get here quick!

1291
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,134
Form ranks!

1292
01:51:32,342 --> 01:51:35,470
Form ranks!

1293
01:51:36,304 --> 01:51:38,932
Show them
the white light we're made of!

1294
01:51:39,141 --> 01:51:42,269
Remember the fires from hell
that forged you!

1295
01:51:42,477 --> 01:51:44,438
Charge!

1296
01:51:46,315 --> 01:51:47,983
Now!

1297
01:51:52,362 --> 01:51:55,699
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!

1298
01:52:18,848 --> 01:52:21,559
Smee! Do something intelligent!

1299
01:52:23,853 --> 01:52:26,772
"Smee, Smee"! What about Smee?

1300
01:52:29,275 --> 01:52:30,943
What about Smee?

1301
01:52:31,903 --> 01:52:33,029
What about me?

1302
01:52:40,953 --> 01:52:42,413
Thud ball!

1303
01:52:54,509 --> 01:52:55,760
Fire!

1304
01:53:07,021 --> 01:53:09,524
Hey, wait!

1305
01:53:10,358 --> 01:53:11,526
Look out below!

1306
01:53:18,491 --> 01:53:21,620
Somebody help!

1307
01:53:32,047 --> 01:53:34,341
Here we go. Take it, take it, take it!

1308
01:53:34,967 --> 01:53:37,260
Lost Boys, down!

1309
01:53:43,725 --> 01:53:45,394
My eyes!

1310
01:53:45,811 --> 01:53:49,148
It's time for Smee.

1311
01:53:58,866 --> 01:54:01,994
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!

1312
01:54:12,713 --> 01:54:13,881
Hook!

1313
01:54:17,718 --> 01:54:20,221
Rufio.

1314
01:54:23,766 --> 01:54:25,643
The old man is mine.

1315
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:29,605
Jack! Save me!

1316
01:54:29,814 --> 01:54:31,274
Maggie!

1317
01:54:42,035 --> 01:54:43,786
Get down here!

1318
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:46,080
Maggie!

1319
01:54:46,289 --> 01:54:47,874
Daddy!

1320
01:54:49,834 --> 01:54:51,294
Wait, ain't you...

1321
01:54:51,502 --> 01:54:52,962
Peter Pan.

1322
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:04,766
Daddy!

1323
01:55:04,974 --> 01:55:06,726
Daddy?

1324
01:55:09,229 --> 01:55:13,400
Peter Pan's my dad?

1325
01:55:32,794 --> 01:55:34,880
I'll never lose you again.

1326
01:55:37,716 --> 01:55:40,719
Lost Boys, we got them on the run!

1327
01:56:16,172 --> 01:56:17,965
Here comes Pan!

1328
01:56:22,428 --> 01:56:24,096
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.

1329
01:56:26,807 --> 01:56:28,601
Hook! No!

1330
01:56:36,526 --> 01:56:38,277
Do you know what I wish?

1331
01:56:38,486 --> 01:56:39,529
What?

1332
01:56:41,823 --> 01:56:44,117
I wish I had a dad...

1333
01:56:44,867 --> 01:56:46,411
like you.

1334
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:53,084
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

1335
01:57:04,137 --> 01:57:06,848
Are you ready for me, Peter?

1336
01:57:07,474 --> 01:57:10,602
Come on. Humour the Hook.

1337
01:57:11,019 --> 01:57:12,062
Dad.

1338
01:57:19,277 --> 01:57:20,403
I wanna go home.

1339
01:57:20,612 --> 01:57:23,240
What are you talking about?
You are home.

1340
01:57:36,461 --> 01:57:37,838
Where are you going?

1341
01:57:52,102 --> 01:57:53,354
Lost Boys!

1342
01:57:56,273 --> 01:57:57,107
Peter!

1343
01:57:57,858 --> 01:58:00,986
Where are you going?
Come back here and fight me!

1344
01:58:01,195 --> 01:58:03,280
I'll find you wherever you are!

1345
01:58:03,489 --> 01:58:05,574
Bad form, Peter! Come back.

1346
01:58:05,783 --> 01:58:09,412
You need a mother very, very badly!

1347
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:14,417
Smee! Follow me!

1348
01:58:14,625 --> 01:58:17,753
- Stairs!
- Just moving your personal....

1349
01:58:19,839 --> 01:58:22,341
Wherever you go, wherever you are...

1350
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:26,929
l vow there will always be daggers
bearing notes signed "James Hook."

1351
01:58:27,138 --> 01:58:31,726
They will be flung at the doors of
your children's children's children.

1352
01:58:31,934 --> 01:58:33,811
Do you hear me?

1353
01:58:43,821 --> 01:58:45,490
What do you want, old man?

1354
01:58:49,869 --> 01:58:51,037
Just you.

1355
01:58:51,246 --> 01:58:53,414
You've got me, James Hook.

1356
01:58:57,168 --> 01:58:59,671
Pan "The Avenger" is back.

1357
01:58:59,879 --> 01:59:03,758
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.

1358
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:15,520
It's Hook and me this time.

1359
01:59:15,854 --> 01:59:18,565
- Prepare to die.
- To die would be a great adventure.

1360
01:59:18,774 --> 01:59:21,568
Death is the only adventure
you have left.

1361
01:59:32,829 --> 01:59:34,706
I remember you being a lot bigger.

1362
01:59:34,915 --> 01:59:36,583
To a 10-year-old, I'm huge.

1363
01:59:51,807 --> 01:59:53,601
No pain, no gain, James!

1364
02:00:08,491 --> 02:00:10,368
Good form, old man.

1365
02:00:14,330 --> 02:00:18,084
You know you're not really Peter Pan.
This is only a dream.

1366
02:00:18,292 --> 02:00:22,672
You'll wake up, you'll be Peter Banning,
a selfish man who drinks too much...

1367
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:27,677
who's obsessed with success and runs
and hides from his wife and children.

1368
02:00:29,554 --> 02:00:31,431
I believe in you.

1369
02:00:31,639 --> 02:00:34,350
- I believe in you.
- I believe in you, Peter.

1370
02:00:35,810 --> 02:00:37,895
I believe in you.

1371
02:00:39,772 --> 02:00:41,357
You are the Pan.

1372
02:00:41,566 --> 02:00:43,443
You're Peter Pan.

1373
02:00:45,737 --> 02:00:46,654
I believe in you...

1374
02:00:47,906 --> 02:00:49,365
Peter Pan.

1375
02:01:09,386 --> 02:01:10,846
- Bad form!
- Jack, stop!

1376
02:01:12,097 --> 02:01:14,182
Now we end this.

1377
02:01:23,275 --> 02:01:25,986
You blackguard!

1378
02:01:36,079 --> 02:01:37,873
Hello! Tick-tock, tick-tock...

1379
02:01:38,081 --> 02:01:40,667
Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock!

1380
02:01:40,876 --> 02:01:45,255
I think not! I think James Hook's
afraid of time, ticking away!

1381
02:01:54,014 --> 02:01:55,057
Tick....

1382
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:10,072
Good form, Peter. I am fallen.

1383
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:18,205
Give me my dignity. You took my hand.
You owe me something.

1384
02:02:30,718 --> 02:02:35,306
You killed Rufio. You kidnapped
my children. You deserve to die.

1385
02:02:35,515 --> 02:02:39,894
Strike, Peter Pan. Strike true.

1386
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:45,108
Daddy, let's go home. Please?

1387
02:02:45,316 --> 02:02:48,236
He's just a mean old man
without a mommy.

1388
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:53,032
Yeah, Dad, let's go.
He can't hurt us anymore.

1389
02:02:53,783 --> 02:02:56,786
Bless you, child. Good form, Jack.

1390
02:02:56,995 --> 02:03:01,166
After all, what would
the world be like...

1391
02:03:02,334 --> 02:03:04,085
without Captain Hook?

1392
02:03:05,337 --> 02:03:08,882
I want you to take your ship and go.

1393
02:03:09,216 --> 02:03:12,135
I never want to see your face
in Never Land again.

1394
02:03:19,726 --> 02:03:22,980
- Peter, look out!
- Fools, James Hook is Never Land!

1395
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:27,651
Whenever children read, it will say:

1396
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:31,196
"Thus perished Peter Pan."

1397
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:44,126
What's happening?

1398
02:04:08,526 --> 02:04:11,988
I want my Mommy!

1399
02:04:32,717 --> 02:04:34,802
Hook's gone.

1400
02:04:35,219 --> 02:04:37,931
Hook's gone! Hook's gone!

1401
02:04:41,184 --> 02:04:43,269
Bangerang!

1402
02:04:46,689 --> 02:04:47,524
No more Hook!

1403
02:04:47,732 --> 02:04:50,985
No more Hook! No more Hook!

1404
02:04:54,406 --> 02:04:56,700
Hurray for Pan the Man!

1405
02:05:04,416 --> 02:05:06,501
What's wrong, Peter?

1406
02:05:06,835 --> 02:05:11,840
I can't stay. I've done what I came
to do, and now I have to go back.

1407
02:05:15,677 --> 02:05:18,805
Tink, make my kids glow.

1408
02:05:27,981 --> 02:05:32,694
Jack, Maggie, all you have
to do is think one happy thought...

1409
02:05:32,903 --> 02:05:34,655
and you'll fly like me.

1410
02:05:38,742 --> 02:05:39,993
Mommy!

1411
02:05:41,328 --> 02:05:42,788
My dad...

1412
02:05:43,831 --> 02:05:45,499
Peter Pan.

1413
02:05:49,670 --> 02:05:51,755
Tink, you know the way.

1414
02:05:51,964 --> 02:05:53,841
I'll be just behind you.

1415
02:06:15,947 --> 02:06:19,700
Don't leave us, Peter,
and don't say goodbye.

1416
02:06:19,909 --> 02:06:21,369
What's "goodbye"?

1417
02:06:21,577 --> 02:06:24,288
It's going away. That's what it is.

1418
02:06:24,497 --> 02:06:26,374
Forgetting about us all over again.

1419
02:06:26,582 --> 02:06:29,502
You're all my Lost Boys.
I'll never forget you.

1420
02:06:30,128 --> 02:06:31,379
Never.

1421
02:06:34,716 --> 02:06:36,801
So who do I leave in charge?

1422
02:07:12,671 --> 02:07:16,216
I want you to take care of everyone
who's smaller than you.

1423
02:07:17,259 --> 02:07:19,469
Then who do I look after?

1424
02:07:20,387 --> 02:07:22,055
Never Bugs.

1425
02:07:23,307 --> 02:07:24,975
Little ones.

1426
02:07:47,289 --> 02:07:50,626
That was a great game.

1427
02:07:51,252 --> 02:07:53,337
{y:i}Thank you for believing.

1428
02:08:28,915 --> 02:08:30,375
I know her.

1429
02:08:31,417 --> 02:08:34,003
She looks like an angel.

1430
02:08:34,212 --> 02:08:36,714
Let's not wake her yet.

1431
02:09:25,305 --> 02:09:29,059
My dear child,
have you been up all night?

1432
02:09:30,102 --> 02:09:33,647
I see them in their beds
so often in my dreams.

1433
02:09:34,189 --> 02:09:36,358
When I wake up, they're still there.

1434
02:10:19,527 --> 02:10:23,072
Tink? Tink? Tink?

1435
02:10:32,248 --> 02:10:33,082
Hello.

1436
02:10:36,211 --> 02:10:40,381
Having trouble with the missis?
You will have, by the time you get home.

1437
02:10:46,638 --> 02:10:47,472
Tink!

1438
02:10:49,557 --> 02:10:53,103
Say it, Peter. Say it and mean it.

1439
02:10:54,562 --> 02:10:56,439
I believe in faeries.

1440
02:10:56,856 --> 02:10:59,776
Do you know that place
between sleep and awake...

1441
02:11:00,193 --> 02:11:02,195
where you still remember dreaming?

1442
02:11:04,573 --> 02:11:06,867
That's where I'll always love you...

1443
02:11:07,826 --> 02:11:09,494
Peter Pan.

1444
02:11:12,289 --> 02:11:14,166
That's where I'll be waiting.

1445
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:35,646
Nana!

1446
02:11:35,854 --> 02:11:39,191
Oh, give us a kiss!
Come here, you drool machine!

1447
02:11:46,907 --> 02:11:48,367
Tink?

1448
02:12:06,093 --> 02:12:09,555
Brad! Hi! Have you been
holding this long?

1449
02:12:10,473 --> 02:12:13,810
I'm incredible! Yeah. Never Land!

1450
02:12:15,061 --> 02:12:19,565
Lost Boys. Jim Hook. Duel to
the death. I'll fill you in later.

1451
02:12:19,774 --> 02:12:21,526
Listen, I'd love to chat...

1452
02:12:21,734 --> 02:12:24,028
but I gotta climb
a drainpipe now.

1453
02:12:24,654 --> 02:12:29,659
Why? Because I ran out of faerie dust.
If not, I would've flown up. Why!!

1454
02:12:35,915 --> 02:12:39,043
- There were pirates...!
- And monsters there!

1455
02:12:39,794 --> 02:12:41,129
Just like you said!

1456
02:12:41,337 --> 02:12:42,797
Granny Wendy!

1457
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:44,883
Let me in!

1458
02:12:45,508 --> 02:12:46,968
Please.

1459
02:12:49,471 --> 02:12:51,890
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?

1460
02:12:54,476 --> 02:12:57,604
What did I tell you about this window?

1461
02:12:57,812 --> 02:12:59,272
Always keep it open!

1462
02:13:01,066 --> 02:13:04,069
Never, ever, ever close....

1463
02:13:23,589 --> 02:13:25,132
I have to take this.

1464
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:29,636
Have you ever known what it's like to
feel the exhilaration of really flying?

1465
02:13:29,845 --> 02:13:31,597
Feel this.

1466
02:13:32,556 --> 02:13:34,099
Where have you been?

1467
02:13:34,308 --> 02:13:35,559
Fly me, Daddy, fly me!

1468
02:13:35,768 --> 02:13:39,313
Anytime, Maggie.
To infinity and back again.

1469
02:13:39,855 --> 02:13:41,607
Hello, Peter.

1470
02:13:42,233 --> 02:13:45,569
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?

1471
02:13:47,238 --> 02:13:49,323
I think these belong to you.

1472
02:14:01,752 --> 02:14:02,587
Look!

1473
02:14:03,004 --> 02:14:06,215
See, look! I didn't lose
my marbles after all!

1474
02:14:06,424 --> 02:14:07,884
Wendy, look! See?

1475
02:14:08,092 --> 02:14:10,803
I didn't lose my marbles after all!

1476
02:14:12,597 --> 02:14:14,348
Hello, boy.

1477
02:14:15,391 --> 02:14:17,268
Hello, Wendy lady.

1478
02:14:17,894 --> 02:14:19,145
Give us a skwoodge.

1479
02:14:30,198 --> 02:14:32,075
Boy, why are you crying?

1480
02:14:32,617 --> 02:14:35,829
I don't know.
A tear for every happy thought.

1481
02:14:36,037 --> 02:14:36,871
One for me?

1482
02:14:37,831 --> 02:14:39,582
- One for me?
- One for me?

1483
02:14:39,791 --> 02:14:42,001
And one for me!

1484
02:14:56,683 --> 02:14:58,685
Seize the day!

1485
02:15:02,105 --> 02:15:05,233
So your adventures are over.

1486
02:15:05,442 --> 02:15:06,902
Oh, no.

1487
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:08,695
To live....

1488
02:15:08,904 --> 02:15:11,698
To live would be
an awfully big adventure.
