1
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,413
Captain.
Yes, sir?

2
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,665
Tell them we wish to board at once.

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,460
With all due respect,

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,963
the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor
wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,965
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,177
As you know, our blockade
is perfectly legal,

7
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,389
and we'd be happy to
receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,498
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,500
This way, please.

10
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,676
We are greatly honored by
your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,678
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,973
My master will be with you shortly.

13
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,270
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,439
I don't sense anything.
It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,485
It's something... elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,988
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,241
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,202
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,329
But not at the expense of the moment.

20
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,374
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,418
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,257
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,509
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,470
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,849
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,935
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,937
I knew it.

28
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,273
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,444
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,446
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,450
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.

32
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,493
Send a droid.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,792
Is it in their nature to
make us wait this long?

34
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:16,505
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear for
something as trivial as this trade dispute.

35
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,310
What is it?

36
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,063
This scheme of yours has
failed, Lord Sidious.

37
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,733
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

38
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:40,696
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime
in my sight again.

39
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,575
This turn of events is unfortunate.

40
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,788
We must accelerate our plans.
Begin landing your troops.

41
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,625
My lord, is that legal?

42
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,044
I will make it legal.

43
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,463
And the Jedi?

44
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,967
The chancellor should never have brought
them into this. Kill them immediately.

45
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,389
Yes. Yes, my lord. Uh, as you wish.

46
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,017
Captain, look!

47
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,561
Shields up!

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,900
Sorry.

49
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,570
Dioxis.

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,036
They must be dead by now.

51
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,082
Destroy what's left of them.

52
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh! Excuse me.

53
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,386
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

54
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,055
Uh-oh. Blast them.

55
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,354
What is going on down there?

56
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,440
We lost the transmission, sir.

57
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,947
Have you ever encountered a
Jedi knight before, sir?

58
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,992
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

59
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,828
Yes, sir.
That won't be enough, sir.

60
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,913
I want droidekas up here at once!

61
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,624
We will not survive this.

62
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,597
Close the blast doors!

63
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,354
That will hold them.

64
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,574
They are still coming through.

65
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,618
This is impossible!

66
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,958
Where are those droidekas?

67
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,295
Master! Destroyers!

68
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,429
They have shield generators!

69
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,224
It's a standoff. Let's go.

70
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,939
They're no match for droidekas.

71
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:24,527
Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

72
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,996
Battle droids.
It's an invasion army.

73
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,376
This is an odd play for
the Trade Federation.

74
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,629
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

75
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,634
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

76
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,637
You were right about one thing, Master.

77
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,224
The negotiations were short.

78
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,811
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

79
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,021
It's Queen Amidala herself.

80
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,817
At last we are getting results.

81
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,945
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

82
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,156
You will not be so pleased
when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy.

83
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,994
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

84
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,663
I was not aware of such failure.

85
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,499
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

86
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,335
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

87
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,713
I know nothing of any ambassadors.

88
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,215
You must be mistaken.

89
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,342
Beware, Viceroy.

90
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,137
The Federation has gone too far this time.

91
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,308
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

92
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,977
You assume too much.

93
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,897
We will see.

94
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,026
She's right. The senate will never...
It's too late now.

95
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,154
Do you think she suspects an attack?
I don't know.

96
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,658
But we must move quickly
to disrupt all communications down there.

97
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:03,918
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

98
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,211
How could that be true?

99
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,674
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

100
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,511
It must... handiwork... negotiate...
ambassadors-

101
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,306
nobody would...
Senator Palpatine.

102
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,308
What's happening?

103
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,310
Check the transmission generator.

104
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:26,273
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: Invasion.

105
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,692
The Federation would not dare go that far.

106
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,655
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

107
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,616
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

108
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,953
Negotiation? We've lost all communications.

109
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,372
And where are the chancellor's ambassadors?

110
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,167
This is a dangerous
situation, Your Highness.

111
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,672
Our security volunteers will be no match
against a battle-hardened Federation army.

112
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,844
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

113
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,508
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship,

114
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,719
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

115
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,596
They may have gotten on one
of your landing craft.

116
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,182
If they're down here, sir, we'll find them.

117
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:47,146
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

118
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,995
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

119
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,165
Get down!

120
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,542
Ay-yee-yee! Wha!

121
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,635
Was'n dat? Hey, wait!

122
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,679
Oh, mooie-mooie! I love you!

123
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,973
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

124
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,810
I spake. The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

125
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,855
Now, get out of here.
No, no, mesa stay.

126
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,983
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

127
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,235
That won't be necessary.
Oh, but it 'tis.

128
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,238
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

129
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,784
Oh, no! Whoo!
Stay down!

130
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,334
You saved my again.

131
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,336
What's this?
A local.

132
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,215
Let's get out of here before
more droids show up. More?

133
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,550
"More" did you spake?

134
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:03,555
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

135
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,892
Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

136
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,354
A city?
Uh-huh.

137
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,650
Can you take us there?
Uh, on second thought, no.

138
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,236
Not really, no.
No?

139
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,488
'Tis embarrassing,

140
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,575
but, uh, my afraid my've been banished.

141
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,787
My forgotten.
Da bosses would do terrible tings to me.

142
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,957
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

143
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,127
- You hear that?
- Yah.

144
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:37,005
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

145
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,675
If they find us, they will crush us,

146
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,346
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

147
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,350
Oh. Yousa point is well seen.

148
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,853
This way. Hurry!

149
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,444
How much further?
Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

150
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,446
Ah, my warning you.

151
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,701
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

152
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,121
Oh, don't worry.
This hasn't been our day for warm welcomes.

153
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,167
Ar, Ar, Ar! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

154
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,009

Ohh.

Ay, ay.

164
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,843
How wude.

165
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,896
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk!
Yousa cannot bees hair.

166
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,526
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

167
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,531
A droid army is about to attack the Naboo.
We must warn them.

168
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,285
Wesa no like da Naboo.
Tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk-tkk.

169
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,162
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

170
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,207
Day tink day brains so big.

171
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,461
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

172
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,922
Mesa no tink so.

173
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,883
Day not know of uss-en.

174
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,970
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle.

175
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,473
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

176
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:38,353
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

177
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,023
Then speed us on our way.

178
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,692
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

179
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,570
We could use a transport.

180
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,489
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

181
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,743
Hmm?
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

182
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:57,622
'tis goen through the planet core.

183
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,583
Now...

184
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,543
go.

185
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,879
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

186
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,089
Master, what's a bongo?

187
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,175
A transport, I hope.

188
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,344
Deysa setten yousa up.

189
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:14,139
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

190
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,393
Mmm... any help here would be hot.

191
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,605
Master, we're short on time.

192
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,400
We'll need a navigator
to get us through the planet's core.

193
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,444
This Gungan may be of help.

194
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,657
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

195
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:37,621
Hisen to be pune-ished.

196
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,998
Ohh.
I saved his life.

197
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,584
He owes me what you call a "life-debt."

198
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:46,546
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

199
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,049
Binkssssss,

200
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,761
yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

201
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,264
Mm, uh-huh.

202
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,728
Begone wit him!

203
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,775
Count me outta dis one.

204
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,028
Better dead here than dead in da core.

205
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:13,281
Yee gods! What mesa sayin?

206
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,261
Dis is nutsen. Oh, gooberfish!

207
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,639
Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
It's a longo tale-o,

208
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,811
buta small part of it would be mesa...
clumsy.

209
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,774
- You were banished because you were clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

210
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,916
Mesa caused mabbe
one, two-y lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

211
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,085
Yud-say boom da gassar,

212
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,005
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

213
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,347
Big gooberfish! Huge-o teeth!

214
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:34,196
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

215
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,793
The invasion is on schedule, my lord.

216
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,880
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

217
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:56,468
They will have no choice
but to accept your control of the system.

218
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:01,264
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

219
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,392
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

220
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,938
You will find controlling
her will not be difficult.

221
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,981
Yes, my lord.

222
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,319
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.

223
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,949
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

224
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,165
Where wesa goin?
Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

225
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,043
Ohh, maxi big, da Force.

226
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,921
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

227
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,006
We're losing power.

228
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,758
Ohhh, no!

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,933
Wesa dyin' here.

230
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,727
Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
What "yet"?

231
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,855
Monsters out dare. Leak'n in here.

232
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,944
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

233
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,531
Power's back.
Huh?

234
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,700
Aah, monster's back!

235
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,834
Relax.

236
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,919
Ohh.
You overdid it.

237
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,687
Horrible.
Head for that outcropping.

238
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,773
Oh, boy.

239
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,144
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

240
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,980
Ah, victory.

241
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,621
Mmm, dis'n loverly.

242
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,171
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

243
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,467
The queen and I will sign a treaty
that will legitimize our occupation here.

244
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,720
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

245
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,349
I will not cooperate.
Now, now, Your Highness.

246
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,561
In time, the suffering of your people
will persuade you to see our point of view.

247
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,815
Commander.
Yes, sir.

248
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,527
Process them.
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

249
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,570
Roger, roger.

250
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,447
Whoops!

251
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:01,087
- We should leave the street, Your Highness.
- Get their weapons.

252
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:04,716
Whoa! Yousa guys bombad!

253
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,220
We're ambassadors for
the supreme chancellor.

254
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,222
Your negotiations seemed to
have failed, Ambassador.

255
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,141
The negotiations never took place.

256
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,643
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

257
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,189
- They've knocked out all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

258
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,733
In the main hangar. This way.

259
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,407
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

260
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:33,036
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

261
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,247
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

262
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,083
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

263
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,921
They need her to sign a treaty to make this
invasion legal. They can't afford to kill her.

264
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,173
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

265
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,258
There's no logic in the
Federation's move here.

266
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,302
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

267
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,846
Our only hope is for the
senate to side with us.

268
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,390
Senator Palpatine will need your help.

269
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,520
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

270
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,522
We are brave, Your Highness.

271
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,858
If you are to leave, Your
Highness, it must be now.

272
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,444
Then I will plead our case to the senate.

273
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,322
Be careful, Governor.

274
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,417
We'll need to free those pilots.

275
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,461
I'll deal with that.

276
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,384
Halt! I'm ambassador to
the supreme chancellor.

277
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,469
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

278
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,806
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

279
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,559
Coruscant? Uh, that doesn't compute.

280
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,561
Uh, wait. You're under arrest.

281
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,360
Come on. Move!

282
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,242
Go!

283
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,477
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.

284
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:28,401
Hello, boyos.

285
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,408
There's the blockade.

286
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,420
The shield generator's been hit!

287
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,513
How wude!

288
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,108
We're losing droids fast.

289
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,612
If we can't get the shield generator fixed,
we'll be sitting ducks.

290
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:18,826
The shields are gone.

291
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,458
The power's back!

292
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,756
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

293
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,467
Deflector shields up at maximum.

294
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,730
There's not enough power to get us to
Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

295
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,733
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

296
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,027
Here, Master. Tatooine.

297
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,739
Small, out of the way, poor. The Trade
Federation have no presence there.

298
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,700
How can you be sure?

299
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,743
It's controlled by the Hutts.

300
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,705
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

301
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,124
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than if we landed...

302
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,084
on a system controlled by the Federation,

303
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,547
except that the Hutts aren't looking
for her, which gives us the advantage.

304
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,013
And Queen Amidala, has
she signed the treaty?

305
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,808
She has disappeared, my lord.

306
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,062
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.

307
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,149
I want that treaty signed.

308
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,317
My lord,

309
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,987
it's impossible to locate the ship.

310
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,322
It's out of our range.

311
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,159
Not for a Sith.

312
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,161
This is my apprentice,

313
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,204
Darth Maul.

314
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,834
He will find your lost ship.

315
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,466
This is getting out of hand.

316
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,593
Now there are two of them.

317
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,763
We should not have made this bargain.

318
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:10,605
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

319
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,608
Without a doubt,
it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

320
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,028
It is to be commended. What is its number?

321
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,866
R2-D2, Your Highness.

322
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,080
Thank you, R2-D2.

323
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,999
Padmé.

324
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,251
Clean this droid up as best you can.

325
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,337
It deserves our gratitude.

326
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,716
Continue, Captain.

327
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,220
Your Highness, with your permission,

328
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:45,389
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

329
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,810
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

330
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:51,562
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

331
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,607
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

332
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,695
Hello.

333
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,782
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

334
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,368
I'm Padmé.

335
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,496
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

336
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,623
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

337
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,792
Uh-huh.

338
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,546
How'd you end up here with us?
My no know.

339
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,341
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

340
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,261

00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,517
Huh. Mesa getten berry, berry scared.

343
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,902
That's it... Tatooine.
There's a settlement.

344
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:44,157
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

345
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,218
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

346
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,762
That'll complicate things. Be wary.

347
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,057
I sense a disturbance in the Force.
I feel it also, Master.

348
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,019
Don't let them send any transmissions.

349
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,735
This sun doen murder to mesa skin.

350
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,321
Wait!

351
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,364
Wait.

352
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,120
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

353
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:35,041
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

354
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,210
The spaceport is not going to be pleasant.

355
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,503
The queen wishes it.

356
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,547
She's curious about the planet.

357
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,134
This is not a good idea.

358
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,178
Stay close to me.

359
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,819
Moisture farms, for the most part.

360
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:08,824
Some indigenous tribes and scavengers.

361
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:13,246
The few spaceports like this one are havens
for those that don't wish to be found.

362
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,289
Like us.

363
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,210
Dissen berry berry bad.

364
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,505
Oh! Icky icky goo!

365
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,771
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

366
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,611
Good day to you.

367
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,531
What do you want?

368
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,742
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

369
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,955
Ah, yes! Nubian. We have lots of that.

370
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,541
Boy, get in here now!

371
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,543
My droid has a readout of what I need.

372
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,839
What took you so long?

373
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,049
I was cleaning the fan switches.

374
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,677
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

375
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,306
So... let me take thee out back, huh?

376
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,268
Ni you'll find what you need.

377
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,770
Hmm?
Don't touch anything.

378
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,904
Hmm.

379
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,783
Are you an angel?
What?

380
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,620
An angel. I heard the deep
space pilots talk about them.

381
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,623
They're the most beautiful creatures
in the universe.

382
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,293
They live on the moons of Lego, I think.

383
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,754
You're a funny little boy.

384
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,797
How do you know so much?

385
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,760
I listen to all the traders and star pilots
who come through here.

386
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:55,139
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

387
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:59,226
You're a pilot?
Mm-hmm. All my life.

388
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,687
How long have you been here?

389
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:05,816
Since I was very little. Three, I think.

390
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,652
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt,

391
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,447
but she lost us betting on the Podraces.

392
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,324
You're a slave?

393
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,661
I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
I'm sorry.

394
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,499
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

395
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,335
Hmm. Hmm.

396
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,838
Where... Wheres yousa goin?

397
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,299
Ugh!

398
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,471
I got ya.
Hey!

399
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,348
What?
Hit the nose.

400
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,017
Oh! Uh.

401
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,606
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,359
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.

403
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,946
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, huh?

404
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,032
Saying of which,

405
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,493
how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?

406
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,703
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,664
Republic credits?

408
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,708
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,920
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,715
No, they won't.
Credits will do fine.

411
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,634
No, they won't!

412
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,972
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,309
I'm a Toydarian.
Mind tricks don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:26,564
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:31,193
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,829
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,415
Oh! Aw! Ooh! Uh!

418
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,127
Ai, ai! Whoa, ai!
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

419
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

420
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,134
I was glad to meet you too.

421
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,222
What? Wha... Oh.

422
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:08,022
Outlanders. They think we know nothing.

423
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,065
They seemed nice to me.

424
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,109
Clean the racks...

425
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,569
...then you can go home.

426
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,529
Yippee!

427
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,954
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

428
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,956
A few containers of supplies.

429
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,126
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with,

430
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,545
not in the amount you're talking about.

431
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,131
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

432
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:36,091
I'll check back later.

433
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,594
Noah gain! Noah gain.

434
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,514
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

435
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,141
Wesa be wobbed un crunched!

436
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,394
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

437
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,281
Hmm? Ah, mooie-mooie.

438
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,535
Hey, hey!

439
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,078
Are you going to pay for that?

440
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,996
Huh? Wanga?

441
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,957
It costs seven wupiupi.

442
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,170
Ah! Chubaa...

443
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,053
Is this yours?

444
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,846
Who, mesa?

445
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,892
Ouch! Ouch!

446
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:29,144
Careful, Sebulba.

447
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,272
He's a big-time outlander.

448
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,942
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

449
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,946
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

450
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,116
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

451
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,661
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

452
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,915
- Hi.
- Hi there.

453
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,876
Your buddy here was about to be
turned into orange goo.

454
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,463
He picked a fight with a Dug,
an especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

455
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,217
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

456
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:04,346
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

457
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,307
Thanks, my young friend.

458
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,475
But... But...

459
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,979
But mesa doen nutten!

460
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,614
This storm will slow them down.

461
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,408
Looks pretty bad.

462
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,119
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

463
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,455
We'll be right there.

464
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,546
Here, you'll like these pallies.

465
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,299
Here.
Thank you.

466
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,719
Oh, my bones are aching.

467
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:48,349
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

468
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,393
Do you have shelter?
We'll head back to our ship.

469
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,104
Is it far?
It's on the outskirts.

470
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,607
You'll never reach the outskirts in time.

471
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,611
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

472
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,197
Come on. I'll take you to my place.

473
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,088
Mom!

474
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:22,883
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ahh, dissen cozy.

475
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,386
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

476
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,098
I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

477
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,558
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

478
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:35,187
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.
Oh, mooie-mooie.

479
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,156
Isn't he great? He's not finished yet.

480
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,117
He's wonderful.

481
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,120
You really like him?

482
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,206
He's a protocol droid to help Mom. Watch.

483
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,878
Oh. Oh. Uh... Where is everybody?

484
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,298
Whoops. Yeah.

485
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,592
Oh, hello.

486
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,012
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

487
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,973
How might I serve you?

488
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,934
He's perfect.
Oh. Perfect.

489
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,563
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

490
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,525
I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable.

491
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,820
Oh, hello.
I don't believe we have been introduced.

492
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,032
R2-D2. A pleasure to meet you.

493
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,161
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

494
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,000
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

495
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,963
My parts are showing? My goodness! Oh!

496
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,053
The death toll is catastrophic.

497
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,514
We must bow to their wishes.

498
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,683
You must contact me.

499
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:57,519
It's a trick. Send no reply.

500
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:01,106
Send no transmissions of any kind.

501
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:04,777
It sounds like bait to
establish a connection trace.

502
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,864
What if it is true, and
the people are dying?

503
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,492
Either way, we're running out of time.

504
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,257
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

505
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,177
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

506
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,179
Move against the Jedi first.

507
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,015
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

508
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,017
to sign the treaty.

509
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,311
At last we will reveal
ourselves to the Jedi.

510
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,855
At last we will have revenge.

511
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,858
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

512
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,361
They will be no match for you.

513
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,204
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

514
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,290
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

515
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,919
Any attempt to escape-
And they blow you up!

516
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,463
Boom!
How wude!

517
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,007
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

518
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,009
The Republic's antislavery laws...

519
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,470
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

520
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,598
We must survive on our own.

521
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,351
Xcuse me.

522
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:22,855
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

523
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:27,609
They have Podracing on Malastare.
Very fast, very dangerous.

524
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,279
I'm the only human who can do it.

525
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,574
You must have Jedi
reflexes if you race pods.

526
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,951
Don't do that again.

527
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,959
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

528
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,463
What makes you think that?

529
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,843
I saw your laser sword.
Only Jedis carry that kind of weapon.

530
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,846
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

531
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,848
I don't think so.

532
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,100
No one can kill a Jedi.

533
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,020
I wish that were so.

534
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,188
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

535
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:08,400
I came back here and freed all the slaves.

536
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,945
Have you come to free us?
No, I'm afraid not.

537
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,408
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

538
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,999
I can see there's no fooling you, Anakin.

539
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,169
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic,

540
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,254
on a very important mission.

541
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,466
How did you end up out
here in the outer rim?

542
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,178
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

543
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,388
I can help.

544
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:42,267
- I can fix anything.
- I believe you can.

545
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,228
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

546
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,065
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

547
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,693
These junk dealers must have
a weakness of some kind.

548
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:56,281
Gambling. Everything here revolves around
betting on those awful races.

549
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:00,577
Podracing. Greed can be a powerful ally.

550
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,580
I built a racer. It's the fastest ever.

551
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:06,166
There's a big race tomorrow on Boonta Eve.

552
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,877
- You could enter my pod.
- Anakin!

553
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:12,089
- Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

554
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,049
You could make him think it was yours...

555
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,426
and get him to let me pilot it for you.

556
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:20,722
I don't want you to race. It's awful.
I die every time Watto makes you do it.

557
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,016
But, Mom, I love it.

558
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,645
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

559
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,064
Anakin.

560
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,984
Your mother's right.

561
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:35,195
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

562
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,407
No.

563
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:48,041
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

564
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,799
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

565
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,801
We'll find some other way.

566
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,178
No.

567
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,764
There is no other way.

568
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,185
I may not like it, but he can help you.

569
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,896
He was meant to help you.

570
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,370
Are you sure about this?

571
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,165
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?

572
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,292
The queen will not approve.

573
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,336
The queen doesn't need to know.

574
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,005
Well, I don't approve.

575
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,842
The boy tells me you want to
sponsor him in the race.

576
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:43,972
How can you do this?
Not on the Republic credits, I think, huh?

577
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,266
My ship will be the entry fee.

578
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,477
Oh, not bad!

579
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,563
Not bad, huh? A Nubian, huh?

580
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,983
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

581
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,611
What would the boy ride?

582
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,281
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It will take some long time to fix it.

583
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,535
It wasn't my fault, really.
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

584
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,039
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

585
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,626
Mmm. That you did, huh.

586
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,545
The boy's good. No doubts there, huh?

587
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,966
I have acquired a pod in a game of chance,
the fastest ever built.

588
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:25,180
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

589
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,227
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee,

590
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,229
and I supply the boy.

591
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:36,233
We split the winnings,
um, 50-50, I think, huh?

592
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,987
If it's going to be 50-50,
I suggest you front the cash for the entry.

593
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,156
If we win,

594
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:47,077
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,413
And if we lose, you keep my ship.

596
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,251
Either way, you win.

597
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,384
Deal!

598
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,851
Your friend is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,778
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,614
We could be stuck here a very long time.

601
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,242
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help,

602
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:30,787
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,873
And...

604
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,834
there's something about this boy.

605
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,009
You should be very proud of your son.

606
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,137
He gives without any thought of reward.

607
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,098
Well, he knows nothing of greed.

608
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:54,186
He has a-
He has special powers.

609
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,189
Yes.

610
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,983
He can see things before they happen.

611
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,903
That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes.

612
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,863
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,824
He deserves better than a slave's life.
Why, certainly.

614
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:11,286
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,333
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,377
Who was his father?

617
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,965
There was no father.

618
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,762
I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,140
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,602
Can you help him?

621
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,646
I don't know.

622
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,777
I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

623
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,869
Hey, hi, Ani.

624
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,455
Hi.

625
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,792
Wow, a real astro droid.

626
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,381
How did you get so lucky?
That isn't the half of it.

627
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,509
I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
What?

628
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,344
With this?

629
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,222
You're such a joker, Ani.

630
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,600
You've been working on that thing
for years. It's never gonna run.

631
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,894
Come on. Let's go and play ball.

632
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,273
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

633
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,656
Hey, Jar Jar.

634
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,200
Keep away from those energy binders.

635
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:35,787
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

636
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,956
Sorry. Okay.

637
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,545
My tongue is fat.

638
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,798
My tongue... Wrench.

639
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,551
Where is da wrench? Oh, dare it is.

640
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,262
Hey. Uh-oh.

641
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,557
Uh, Ani, I'm stuck. Ani-

642
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:59,686
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

643
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,399
You don't even know if
this thing's gonna run.

644
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,609
It will.
I think it's time we found out.

645
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,945
Here, use this power charge.
Yes, sir!

646
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,114
Come on, Kitster. Let's move away.

647
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,408
My... My mouth.

648
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:17,162
Ani, I'm stuck.

649
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:22,292
Uh, hey. My tongue is fat. Ani!

650
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,378
You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

651
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,132
Oh. Th... Thank you.

652
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,134
Go.

653
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:49,277
It's working! It's working!

654
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,415
Stay still, Ani. Let me clean this cut.

655
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,503
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

656
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,463
Most of them.

657
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,590
Has anyone been to 'em all?

658
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,510
Not likely.

659
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,679
I wanna be the first one to see 'em all.

660
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,433
Ani, bedtime!
Ow!

661
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,269
There we are. Good as new.

662
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,231
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

663
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,859
What are you doing?
Checking your blood for infections.

664
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,613
Go on. You have a big day tomorrow.

665
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,615
Sleep well, Ani.

666
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,370
Obi-Wan?
Yes, Master?

667
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,123
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

668
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,584
Wait a minute.

669
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,670
I need a midi-chlorian count.

670
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,300
The reading is off the chart.

671
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,261
Over 20,000.

672
00:50:56,345 --> 00:51:00,056
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

673
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,933
No Jedi has.

674
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,102
What does that mean?

675
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,146
I'm not sure.

676
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,469
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

677
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,306
Patience, my blue friend. You'll have
your winnings before the suns set.

678
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,642
And we'll be far away from here.

679
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:29,312
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

680
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:33,274
I warn you, no funny business.

681
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,528
You don't think Anakin can win?
Don't get me wrong, no.

682
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,155
I have great faith in the boy.

683
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,407
He's a credit to your race,

684
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,744
but, uh, Sebulba there is
going to win, I think.

685
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,581
Oh, no!

686
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,587
Why do you think that?

687
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,508
He always wins!

688
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,094
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

689
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,224
- I'll take that bet.
- You what?

690
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,727
I'll wager my new racing pod against, say,

691
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,729
the boy and his mother.

692
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,525
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

693
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,194
The boy, then.

694
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,989
Hmm. Well, uh-

695
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,953
We'll let fate decide, huh?

696
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,498
I just happen to have a chance cube here.

697
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,668
Blue, it's the boy.

698
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,964
Red, uh... his mother.

699
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:52,312
You won this small toss, outlander,
but you won't win the race!

700
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,522
So it makes little difference!

701
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:09,245
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,543
What'd he mean by that?
I'll tell you later.

703
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,712
Good morning.

704
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,797
Oh, my.

705
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,883
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

706
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,972
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

707
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:31,476
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

708
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,855
- Do what?
- Finish the race, of course.

709
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,568
- You've never won a race?
- Well, not exactly.

710
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,695
Not even finished?

711
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,323
Kitster's right. I will this time.

712
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,492
Of course you will.

713
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,979
...Podracers.

714
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,981
That's absolutely right.

715
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:24,153
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:27,865
I see the contestants are making their way
out onto the starting grid.

717
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,829
I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.

718
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,920
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

719
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,092
Sebulba!

720
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,771
And in the front row,
nearside pole position,

721
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,940
Mawhonic!

722
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,152
A hearty hello...

723
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:08,030
to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

724
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,867
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

725
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,036
And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

726
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:18,750
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

727
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,380
And hoping for a big win today,

728
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:28,885
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

729
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,059
And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker,

730
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,645
a local boy.

731
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,441
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

732
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,912
Huh?

733
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,541
Pee yousa!

734
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,171
Be safe.

735
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,674
I will, Mom. I promise.

736
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,020
Uh-oh.

737
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,484
You won't walk away from this one...

738
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,861
you slave scum.

739
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,240
Don't count on it, slime ball.

740
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,575
You're Bantha fodder!

741
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,541
You all set, Ani?
Yep.

742
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,543
Right.
Whoa!

743
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,049
Remember, concentrate on the moment.

744
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,928
Feel, don't think. Use your instincts.

745
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,680
I will.

746
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,015
May the Force be with you.

747
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,986
Jabba the Hutt.

748
00:58:12,406 --> 00:58:14,907
Mmm.

749
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,832
Welcome.

750
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,461
Begin the race!

751
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,559
Hey, it looks like they're
clearing the grid.

752
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,645
Is he nervous?
He's fine.

753
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:49,150
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

754
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,153
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

755
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,155
You should too.

756
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,699
You assume too much.

757
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,869
Start your engines.

758
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:42,495
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

759
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,382
Oh!

760
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,142
Oh, no! No!

761
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,733
Wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

762
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:27,415
Well, it looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

763
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,502
Come on, Ani!

764
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,885
And there goes Skywalker!
Go, Ani, go!

765
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,179
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

766
01:01:55,754 --> 01:02:00,591
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out on the canyon dune turn.

767
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,518
Doowat macroon!

768
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:16,524
Ooh, there goes Quadinaros' power coupling.

769
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,111
Cheespa wata!

770
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:21,821
Ooh!

771
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:25,825
- Chubba Ni chees Sebulba!
- Paketa!

772
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,618
Kulkah meeka!

773
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:32,373
Ody Mandrell coona wa wunda dungo!

774
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:40,798
Whoa!

775
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:46,428
Oh, no!

776
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:49,390
Oh.

777
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:54,353
Where is Master Anakin?

778
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,649
Look. Here he comes.

779
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,821
It looks like Skywalker is
moving up in the field.

780
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,157
Yay! Yippee!

781
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,166
He has to complete two more circuits?

782
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,209
Oh, dear.

783
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,428
Ah.

784
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,931
Ha!

785
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,654
Skywalker's spinning out of control!

786
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:28,549
Oh, I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

787
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,349
Here he comes! Owoo!

788
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:40,602
At the start of the final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead,

789
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,188
followed closely by Skywalker!

790
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,857
Go, Ani!

791
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:13,552
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

792
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,684
Whoa-oa!

793
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,404
Huh?

794
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,911
- It's Skywalker!
- Sebulba!

795
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:43,332
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

796
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,209
Did he crash-ed?

797
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,965
Wah hota!

798
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:29,336
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

799
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,017
He's catching Sebulba!
Inkabunga!

800
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,686
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

801
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,148
Wha... Chuba da noya!

802
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,345
That little human being is out of his mind.
Punda tah punda!

803
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:04,056
They're side by side!
Bangu du bangu!

804
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,911
Poo doo!

805
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,210
Yippee!
Yay!

806
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,921
Ya eeka buta! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

807
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,174
I can't believe it.

808
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,176
The crowds are going nuts!

809
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:43,428
Oh! Ah! Oh! Ah!

810
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:49,977
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah!

811
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,145
Yay, Ani!

812
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,525
Mom, I did it! Yeah!

813
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:05,951
Ohh!

814
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:08,912
Good going, Ani!

815
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,252
We owe you everything, Ani.

816
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,754
Mmm!
Aww.

817
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,007
It's so wonderful, Ani.

818
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:22,843
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

819
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,178
I'm so very proud of you.

820
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,685
Oy chuba no.

821
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:37,524
You.

822
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:39,943
You swindled me!

823
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:43,905
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

824
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,907
I lost everything.

825
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,910
Whenever you gamble,
my friend, eventually you'll lose.

826
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,913
Bring the parts to the main hangar.

827
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:55,334
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

828
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,795
You can't have him. It wasn't a fair bet.

829
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,426
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

830
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,595
I'm sure they can settle this.

831
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:11,016
Take him.

832
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,816
Hidoe!

833
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,819
Well, we have
all the essential parts we need.

834
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:26,073
I'm going back.
Some unfinished business. I won't be long.

835
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,660
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

836
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,622
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

837
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,624
Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

838
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,293
Yes, Master. That shouldn't take long.

839
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,545
Come on. Hup!

840
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,303
Hey. These are yours.

841
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,347
Yes!

842
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,684
Mom, we sold the pod!

843
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,186
Look at all the money we have!
My goodness!

844
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,231
But that's so wonderful, Ani.
And he has been freed.

845
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,109
- What?
- You're no longer a slave.

846
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,946
Did you hear that?

847
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,199
Now you can make your
dreams come true, Ani.

848
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,035
You are free.

849
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,040
Will you take him with you?

850
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,459
Is he to become a Jedi?
Yes.

851
01:12:19,544 --> 01:12:21,461
Our meeting was not a coincidence.

852
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,005
Nothing happens by accident.

853
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,676
You mean I get to come
with you in your starship?

854
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,678
Anakin,

855
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,391
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge,

856
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,394
and even if you succeed, it's a hard life.

857
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,689
But I wanna go.
It's what I've always dreamed of doing.

858
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,650
Can I go, Mom?

859
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:45,986
Anakin,

860
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,322
this path has been placed before you.

861
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,950
The choice is yours alone.

862
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,456
I wanna do it.

863
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,251
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

864
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,462
Yippee!

865
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,469
What about Mom?

866
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,474
Is she free too?

867
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:19,102
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

868
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:22,147
You're coming with us, aren't you, Mom?

869
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:33,450
Son, my place is here. My future is here.

870
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:36,953
It is time for you to let go.

871
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,247
I don't want things to change.

872
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,750
But you can't stop the change...

873
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,920
any more than you can stop
the suns from setting.

874
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,923
Oh, I love you.

875
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,514
Now hurry.

876
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,437
Thank you.

877
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:05,440
I'll watch after him. You have my word.

878
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:10,111
Will you be all right?

879
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,155
Yeah.

880
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,785
Oh! Oh, my. Oh!

881
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,787
Hello, Master Anakin.

882
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,956
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

883
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,458
and I'm going away in a starship.

884
01:14:23,543 --> 01:14:26,503
Master Anakin,
you are my maker and I wish you well.

885
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:30,841
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

886
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:36,304
I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, 3PO,
give you coverings and all.

887
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:40,350
I'm gonna miss working on you.
You've been a great pal.

888
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:43,353
I'll make sure
Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

889
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,188
Sell me?

890
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:46,940
Bye.

891
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,942
Oh, my.

892
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,302
I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

893
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,096
Ani.

894
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,600
Will I ever see you again?

895
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,937
What does your heart tell you?

896
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,524
I hope so.

897
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,526
Yes.

898
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:33,528
I guess.

899
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,531
Then we will see each other again.

900
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,454
I will come back and free you, Mom.

901
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,497
I promise.

902
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,717
Now, be brave...

903
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,511
and don't look back.

904
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:00,513
Don't look back.

905
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:48,728
- Qui-Gon, sir, wait! I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

906
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,150
Go! Tell them to take off!

907
01:17:07,707 --> 01:17:09,624
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

908
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:11,418
Take off.

909
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:14,337
Over there. Fly low.

910
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,152
Are you all right?

911
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,154
I think so.

912
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,156
What was it?

913
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,659
I'm not sure,
but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.

914
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,746
My guess is it was after the queen.

915
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,373
What are we gonna do about it?

916
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,210
We shall be patient.

917
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,130
Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

918
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,424
Hi.

919
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:03,261
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

920
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:13,354
Your queen is lost, your
people are starving,

921
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,356
and you, Governor, are going to die...

922
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:18,359
much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

923
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,612
This invasion will gain you nothing.

924
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,740
We're a democracy. The people have decided.

925
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:25,784
Take him away.

926
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:32,082
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

927
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,584
for these rumored underwater villages.

928
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,128
They will not stay hidden for long.

929
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,892
The death toll is catastrophic.

930
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:53,603
We must bow to their wishes.

931
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,980
You must contact me.

932
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,996
You all right?

933
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,791
It's very cold.

934
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,677
You come from a warm planet, Ani.

935
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,179
A little too warm for my taste.

936
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,557
Space is cold.

937
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:32,851
You seem sad.

938
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,271
The queen is worried.

939
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,731
Her people are suffering, dying.

940
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,402
She must convince the
senate to intervene, or...

941
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,197
I'm not sure what'll happen.

942
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,701
I made this for you...

943
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,037
so you'd remember me.

944
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,457
I carved it out of a japor snippet.

945
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,377
It'll bring you good fortune.

946
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,379
It's beautiful.

947
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,882
But I don't need this to remember you by.

948
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,930
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani,

949
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,600
but my caring for you will remain.

950
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,480
I care for you, too, only I...

951
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,733
Miss your mother.

952
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:44,380
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

953
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,257
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

954
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,636
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

955
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,168
It is a great gift to see
you alive, Your Majesty.

956
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,088
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

957
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,882
I'm anxious to hear your
report on the situation.

958
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,593
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

959
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:34,847
Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor
to finally meet you in person.

960
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:37,558
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

961
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,812
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

962
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,648
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

963
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,652
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

964
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,654
There is a question of procedure,

965
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,490
but I'm confident we can overcome it.

966
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,493
I must speak with the
Jedi Council immediately.

967
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,454
The situation has become
much more complicated.

968
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:06,129
Ani, come on.

969
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,018
The queen's a bein'
grossly nice, mesa tinks.

970
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,354
Pitty hot.

971
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:55,511
There is no civility, only politics.

972
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:59,515
The Republic is not what it once was.

973
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,896
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

974
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,898
There is no interest...

975
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,108
in the common good.

976
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,444
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

977
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:14,447
There is little chance
the senate will act on the invasion.

978
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,450
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

979
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:21,662
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

980
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,625
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

981
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,504
The bureaucrats are in charge now.
What options have we?

982
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:33,174
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

983
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,176
of a stronger supreme chancellor,

984
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,762
one who could control the bureaucrats...

985
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,722
and give us justice.

986
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:44,102
You could call for a
vote of no confidence...

987
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:46,104
in Chancellor Valorum.

988
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,731
He has been our strongest supporter.

989
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:54,070
Our only other choice
would be to submit a plea to the courts.

990
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,532
The courts take even longer to
decide things than the senate.

991
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,535
Our people are dying, Senator.

992
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:04,372
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

993
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,083
To be realistic, Your Majesty,

994
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:12,255
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

995
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,050
That is something I cannot do.

996
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,977
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

997
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,022
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

998
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:34,318
Impossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

999
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,614
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

1000
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,826
Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

1001
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,829
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

1002
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,957
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

1003
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,001
May the Force be with you.

1004
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,465
Master Qui-Gon.

1005
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,009
More to say have you?

1006
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,180
With your permission, my master,

1007
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,684
I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

1008
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,812
A vergence, you say?

1009
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,064
Located around a person?

1010
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,066
A boy.

1011
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:17,987
His cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life-form.

1012
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,032
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

1013
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,036
You refer to the prophecy...

1014
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,538
of the one who will bring
balance to the Force.

1015
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,457
You believe it's this boy?

1016
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,210
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

1017
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:34,962
Revealed your opinion is.

1018
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:37,089
I request the boy be tested, Master.

1019
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:42,428
Oh? Trained as a Jedi you
request for him, hmm?

1020
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:45,306
Finding him was the will of the Force.

1021
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,350
I have no doubt of that.

1022
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,067
Bring him before us, then.

1023
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,996
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1024
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:11,040
Let him in.

1025
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:17,838
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padmé's not here right now.

1026
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,258
Who is it?

1027
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:23,386
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1028
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,388
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1029
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:30,393
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

1030
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:34,355
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

1031
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,357
We will tell her for you.

1032
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:39,068
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1033
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,279
Thank you, Your Highness.

1034
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:59,338
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1035
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:10,516
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

1036
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,019
a tragedy has occurred...

1037
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:16,647
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1038
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,775
and has now engulfed our entire planet...

1039
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,902
in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

1040
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,238
This is outrageous!

1041
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,907
I object to the senator's statements.

1042
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:31,078
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1043
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:35,082
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

1044
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,168
recently elected ruler of the Naboo,

1045
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,170
who speaks on our behalf.

1046
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,928
Honorable representatives of the Republic,

1047
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,140
I come to you
under the gravest of circumstances.

1048
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:54,268
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1049
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:57,813
I object! There is no proof!

1050
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,815
This is incredible.

1051
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,986
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo
to ascertain the truth.

1052
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,322
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

1053
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:09,241
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1054
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,744
A commission must be appointed.
The point...

1055
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,997
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
- Enter the bureaucrat.

1056
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,792
The true rulers of the Republic.

1057
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:22,046
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation,
I might add.

1058
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:26,384
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength
will disappear.

1059
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,304
The point is conceded.

1060
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,307
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1061
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:35,935
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1062
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,937
I will not defer.

1063
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:41,565
I've come before you to resolve this attack
on our sovereignty now.

1064
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,694
I was not elected
to watch my people suffer and die...

1065
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,530
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1066
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,827
If this body is not capable of action,

1067
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:55,955
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1068
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,584
I move for a vote of no confidence...

1069
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,670
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1070
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:14,807
Vote now! Vote now!

1071
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,685
Vote now! Vote now!
Order!

1072
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,688
Now they will elect a new chancellor,

1073
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:22,690
a strong chancellor,

1074
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,693
one who will not let our tragedy continue.

1075
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:31,699
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1076
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,744
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.

1077
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:37,747
Do not defy the council, Master,
not again.

1078
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:40,624
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1079
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:46,255
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1080
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:49,508
They will not
go along with you this time.

1081
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,511
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1082
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,183
A ship.

1083
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,770
A cup.

1084
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,688
A ship.

1085
01:30:03,774 --> 01:30:06,317
A speeder.

1086
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,196
Hmm.

1087
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,742
How feel you?

1088
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,744
Cold, sir.

1089
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,872
Afraid are you?

1090
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,916
No, sir.

1091
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,627
See through you we can.

1092
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:26,629
Be mindful of your feelings.

1093
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,507
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1094
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,719
- I miss her.
- Mmm.

1095
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,305
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?

1096
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:38,599
What has that got to do with anything?

1097
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,018
Everything.

1098
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,188
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1099
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,191
Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate.

1100
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:50,694
Hate leads to suffering.

1101
01:30:57,202 --> 01:31:00,120
I sense much fear in you.

1102
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,428
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1103
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,430
I don't know.

1104
01:31:18,515 --> 01:31:21,100
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1105
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,604
I hope not.

1106
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,315
Gungans no dyin' without a fight.

1107
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,317
Wesa warriors.

1108
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,821
Wesa got a grand army.

1109
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:37,324
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1110
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:40,286
Your Highness?

1111
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:43,581
Your Highness.

1112
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,834
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1113
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,003
as supreme chancellor.

1114
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:52,006
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

1115
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:56,802
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1116
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,596
Who else has been nominated?

1117
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,017
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1118
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:08,063
I feel confident our situation
will create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1119
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:11,775
I will be chancellor.

1120
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,528
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats,

1121
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,865
there'll be nothing left of our people,
our way of life.

1122
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,867
I understand your concern, Your Majesty.

1123
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:23,495
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1124
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:29,376
Senator, this is your arena.

1125
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,420
I feel I must return to mine.

1126
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,926
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1127
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,011
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

1128
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,013
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1129
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,515
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1130
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,143
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1131
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,145
Captain.
Your Highness.

1132
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,147
Ready my ship.

1133
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,943
Please, Your Majesty, stay
here where it's safe.

1134
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,237
It is clear to me now
that the Republic no longer functions.

1135
01:32:57,322 --> 01:33:01,659
I pray you will bring
sanity and compassion back to the senate.

1136
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,421
The Force is strong with him.

1137
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:16,465
He is to be trained, then?

1138
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,970
No, he will not be trained.

1139
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:22,805
No?

1140
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,850
He is too old.

1141
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:30,771
He is the chosen one. You must see it.

1142
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:35,526
Mmm. Clouded this boy's future is.

1143
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,530
I will train him, then.

1144
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,704
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

1145
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,790
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1146
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,251
Impossible to take on a second.

1147
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,003
The code forbids it.

1148
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:57,548
Obi-Wan is ready.
I am ready to face the trials.

1149
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,301
Our own counsel we will
keep on who is ready.

1150
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,303
He is headstrong,

1151
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,765
and he has much to learn of the
living Force, but he is capable.

1152
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,892
There is little more he can learn from me.

1153
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,355
Young Skywalker's fate...

1154
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,315
will be decided later.

1155
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,985
Now is not the time for this.

1156
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,738
The senate is voting for a
new supreme chancellor,

1157
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,532
and Queen Amidala is returning home,

1158
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,869
which will put pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1159
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:29,288
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1160
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:33,792
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1161
01:34:35,045 --> 01:34:36,962
This is the clue we need...

1162
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:39,339
to unravel the mystery of the Sith.

1163
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,259
May the Force be with you.

1164
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,358
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1165
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,360
From your point of view.

1166
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1167
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,867
His fate is uncertain. He's not dangerous.

1168
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:09,369
The council will decide Anakin's future.

1169
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:12,372
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1170
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,799
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1171
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:24,134
You won't be, Ani.

1172
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:28,347
I'm not allowed to train you,
so I want you to watch me and be mindful.

1173
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,350
Always remember:

1174
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:34,103
Your focus determines your reality.

1175
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,397
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.

1176
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,316
Master, sir,

1177
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,028
I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.

1178
01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:46,657
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1179
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,327
Midi-chlorians are a
microscopic life-form...

1180
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,704
that resides within all living cells.

1181
01:35:54,124 --> 01:35:57,000
They live inside me?
Inside your cells, yes.

1182
01:35:57,127 --> 01:36:00,629
And we are symbionts with them.
Symbionts?

1183
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:04,633
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1184
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,636
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1185
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,556
and we would have no
knowledge of the Force.

1186
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,558
They continually speak to us,

1187
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,352
telling us the will of the Force.

1188
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,604
When you learn to quiet your mind,

1189
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,606
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1190
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:21,608
I don't understand.

1191
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:25,195
With time and training, Ani, you will.
You will.

1192
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,287
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to
continue to serve and protect you.

1193
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,289
I welcome your help.

1194
01:36:35,373 --> 01:36:38,792
Senator Palpatine fears
that the Federation means to destroy me.

1195
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:42,087
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1196
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,090
Wesa goin' ho-o-o-me!

1197
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:48,093
Come on, R2.

1198
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,730
Is the planet secure?

1199
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:03,734
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1200
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,945
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1201
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:12,910
Good. I will see to it that in the senate
things stay as they are.

1202
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:16,914
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1203
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,916
Yes, my lord.

1204
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,918
A Sith here?

1205
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,800
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1206
01:37:28,885 --> 01:37:31,303
And those two control the pitch?

1207
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,765
You catch on pretty quick.

1208
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:36,767
As soon as we land,

1209
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,603
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1210
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,440
I agree. I'm not sure
what you wish to accomplish by this.

1211
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,443
I will take back what's ours.

1212
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:48,987
There are too few of us, Your Highness.

1213
01:37:49,072 --> 01:37:50,989
We have no army.

1214
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:54,660
And I can only protect you.
I can't fight a war for you.

1215
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:56,745
Jar Jar Binks.

1216
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:59,873
Mesa, Your Highness?

1217
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,876
Yes. I need your help.

1218
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,342
I have one battleship on my scope.

1219
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,552
It's a droid control ship.

1220
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,554
They've probably spotted us.

1221
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,682
We haven't much time.

1222
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:32,072
Jar Jar is on his way to the
Gungan city, Master. Good.

1223
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:35,075
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1224
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,078
The Gungans will not be easily swayed.

1225
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:41,039
And we cannot use our power to help her.

1226
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,919
I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior, Master.

1227
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:49,798
It's not my place
to disagree with you about the boy.

1228
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:55,012
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1229
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:58,015
You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan.

1230
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,352
And you're a much wiser man than I am.

1231
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:06,189
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1232
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:21,580
Desa nobody dare.

1233
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:23,874
The Gungan city is deserted.

1234
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,543
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1235
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:29,755
Do you think they have been
taken to the camps?

1236
01:39:29,839 --> 01:39:32,174
More likely they were wiped out.

1237
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,385
Mesa no tink so.
Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1238
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,930
When in trouble, Gungans
go to sacred place.

1239
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,933
Mesa show you. Come on. Mesa show you!

1240
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,914
Your Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1241
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:13,882
Uh, h-heyo dadee,
Big Boss Nass, Your Honor.

1242
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:17,094
Jar Jar Binks.

1243
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:21,348
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1244
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,725
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1245
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:26,978
I come before you in peace.

1246
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,940
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1247
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:33,235
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1248
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:37,072
Yousa all bombad.

1249
01:40:37,156 --> 01:40:40,784
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1250
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,786
Your Honor.

1251
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,374
Whosa dis?

1252
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,419
I am Queen Amidala.
Huh?

1253
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,296
This is my decoy,

1254
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:56,758
my protection, my loyal bodyguard.

1255
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,179
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1256
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:04,182
Although we do not always
agree, Your Honor,

1257
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:07,185
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1258
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,187
- Ah.
- The Trade Federation...

1259
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:11,481
has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1260
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:14,901
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1261
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:17,237
I ask you to help us.

1262
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,073
No, I beg you to help us.

1263
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:22,534
We are your humble servants.

1264
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:28,582
Our fate is in your hands.

1265
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:31,168
Mmm.

1266
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:42,512
Ha!

1267
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:50,061
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1268
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,443
Me-e-esa lika dis!

1269
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,361
Maybe...

1270
01:41:58,446 --> 01:42:01,031
wesa...

1271
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:03,033
bein friends.

1272
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:11,124
Yippee! Ya-hoo!

1273
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:13,543
We've sent our patrols.

1274
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,130
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1275
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:19,424
It won't be long, my lord.

1276
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:22,677
This is an unexpected move for her.

1277
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,804
It's too aggressive.

1278
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:27,349
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1279
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:30,018
Let them make the first move.

1280
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,062
Yes, my master.

1281
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:37,234
Deysa comin!

1282
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,736
All right!

1283
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,490
They're here!

1284
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,534
Good. They made it.

1285
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:51,915
Yousa doen grand.

1286
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,961
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1287
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:57,963
Ah, no, no, no.

1288
01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:01,049
So, wesa make you...

1289
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,176
bombad general.

1290
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:05,679
General?

1291
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,766
Captain.

1292
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,519
Your Highness.
What is the situation?

1293
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,521
Almost everyone's in camps.

1294
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:17,857
A few hundred police and guards have
formed an underground resistance movement.

1295
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,527
I brought back
as many of the leaders as I could.

1296
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:25,282
The Federation army's also much larger
than we thought, and much stronger.

1297
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:29,703
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1298
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,705
The battle is a diversion.

1299
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:35,000
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1300
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:37,669
R2.

1301
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:41,381
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1302
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:43,383
Once we get to the main entrance,

1303
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,303
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.

1304
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,347
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1305
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:52,726
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1306
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,728
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1307
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:56,980
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1308
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:59,482
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1309
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:02,027
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1310
01:44:02,111 --> 01:44:06,865
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1311
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,285
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1312
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:13,580
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1313
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,582
We will send what pilots we have...

1314
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:18,710
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1315
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,921
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1316
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,924
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1317
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,926
There's an even bigger danger.

1318
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,928
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness,

1319
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,264
he will return with another droid army.

1320
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:34,601
Well, that is why we must not
fail to get the viceroy.

1321
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,603
Everything depends on it.

1322
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:44,611
She is more foolish than I thought.

1323
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:49,658
We are sending all troops to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1324
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:52,452
It appears to be made up of primitives.

1325
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:55,121
This will work to our advantage.

1326
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,999
I have your approval to
proceed, then, my lord?

1327
01:44:58,084 --> 01:45:00,543
Wipe them out.

1328
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:04,172
All of them.

1329
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,913
Halt!

1330
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:42,085
Starting up the shield.

1331
01:46:11,282 --> 01:46:12,824
Open fire.

1332
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:32,177
Once we get inside, you find a
safe place to hide and stay there.

1333
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:34,220
Sure.
Stay there.

1334
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:52,280
Roger. Roger.

1335
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:03,374
I thought the battle
was going to take place far from here.

1336
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:06,002
This is too close.

1337
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,634
Ani, find cover.

1338
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,721
Quick!
Get to your ships!

1339
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,860
Aah!

1340
01:47:43,082 --> 01:47:45,041
Aah!

1341
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:17,866
- Fighters straight ahead.
- Roger, Bravo Leader.

1342
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:19,242
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1343
01:48:27,084 --> 01:48:28,960
Cease fire.

1344
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,970
Steady. Steady.

1345
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:15,298
Activate the droids.
Yes, sir.

1346
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:33,691
Ouch time.

1347
01:49:47,790 --> 01:49:50,166
Fire!

1348
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:52,460
Whoa-ohh!

1349
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:05,139
Aah! Whoa!

1350
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:13,022
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1351
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:16,526
Red group! Blue group! Everybody, this way!

1352
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:18,653
Hey, wait for me!

1353
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:21,155
Stay where you are. You'll be safe there.

1354
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,700
- But I...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1355
01:50:35,421 --> 01:50:38,715
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1356
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:00,862
We gotta do something, R2.

1357
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,596
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1358
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:33,102
Oops, wrong one. Maybe it's this one.

1359
01:51:33,187 --> 01:51:36,606
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1360
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:40,276
Yeah!

1361
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:47,617
Let's go!

1362
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,952
It's on automatic pilot.

1363
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:02,423
Try to override it.

1364
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:02,900
We don't have time for this, Captain.

1365
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,908
Look! There they are.

1366
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,369
That's where the autopilot's taking us.

1367
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:27,091
Huh? Waaah! Aah! Aah!

1368
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:29,135
Aah!

1369
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:33,014
Aaah! Hmm!
Dumb droid. Take that!

1370
01:53:33,098 --> 01:53:36,350
Get off! Get off! Get off! Get off!

1371
01:53:36,435 --> 01:53:38,436
Ooh! Ooh! Mooie!

1372
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,897
Whoo-hoo! Aah!

1373
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:48,779
The deflector shield is too strong.

1374
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,457
This is tense!

1375
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:03,794
Whoa! R2, get us off this autopilot.

1376
01:54:03,879 --> 01:54:06,047
It's gonna get us both killed.

1377
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:10,176
You did it, R2!

1378
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,969
Okay, let's go left.

1379
01:54:15,057 --> 01:54:17,850
Go back?

1380
01:54:17,935 --> 01:54:22,271
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1381
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:31,572
I'll try spinning. That's a good trick.

1382
01:54:31,657 --> 01:54:33,658
Whoa!

1383
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:39,789
I know we're in trouble. Just hang on.

1384
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:48,673
Go!

1385
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:54,262
Ascension guns!

1386
01:57:00,305 --> 01:57:01,972
Retreat! Retreat!

1387
01:57:03,725 --> 01:57:05,643
Dis is nutsen.

1388
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:17,488
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1389
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:20,282
Ohh! Ohh!

1390
01:57:35,715 --> 01:57:38,134
Hey! Hey!

1391
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:41,846
Give me a lift! Aaah! Oh!

1392
01:57:46,143 --> 01:57:47,768

01:57:47,853 --> 01:57:49,520

01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:51,564

1396
01:57:53,692 --> 01:57:56,819
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

1397
01:57:57,988 --> 01:57:59,613
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1398
01:57:59,698 --> 01:58:02,741
Whoa-ohh!

1399
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:04,743
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1400
01:58:06,455 --> 01:58:08,706
Help me!

1401
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:13,294
Jar Jar! Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1402
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:26,182
Put down your weapons. They win this round.

1403
01:58:39,070 --> 01:58:41,322
We're hit, R2! Aah!

1404
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:57,505
I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop!

1405
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:06,180
Everything's overheated.

1406
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:09,683
Oops. This is not good.

1407
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:59,108
No!

1408
02:00:21,756 --> 02:00:24,300
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1409
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:26,260
Mesa tink of something.

1410
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:28,804
- Hands up.
- My give up.

1411
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,806
My give up.

1412
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:42,610
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1413
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:46,655
Time for you to sign the treaty and end
this pointless debate in the senate.

1414
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:48,532
Viceroy!

1415
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:50,618
Your occupation here has ended.

1416
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:55,497
After her. This one's a decoy.

1417
02:01:02,047 --> 02:01:04,673
Captain!

1418
02:01:12,223 --> 02:01:14,850
Jam the doors.

1419
02:01:17,646 --> 02:01:21,190
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1420
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:25,754
Yes! We have power.

1421
02:02:25,839 --> 02:02:28,382
Shields up.

1422
02:02:30,135 --> 02:02:31,885
Take this!

1423
02:02:33,221 --> 02:02:35,681
And this!

1424
02:02:35,765 --> 02:02:37,725
Whoa!

1425
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:44,106
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1426
02:02:44,232 --> 02:02:47,443
There seems to be a problem with
the main reactor. Impossible!

1427
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:49,445
Nothing can get through our shield.

1428
02:02:50,655 --> 02:02:53,449
Let's get outta here.

1429
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,250
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1430
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:07,796
We didn't hit it.

1431
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:14,428
Now, this is Podracing.

1432
02:03:14,512 --> 02:03:18,307
- Look, one of ours, out of the main hold!
- Whoo!

1433
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:25,689
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1434
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:39,119
What the...

1435
02:03:39,204 --> 02:03:41,497
Was'n they doing?

1436
02:03:41,581 --> 02:03:45,167
The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

1437
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:49,254
They all broke-ed.

1438
02:04:37,637 --> 02:04:41,056
No, it... it's too late.

1439
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,517
No.
Obi-Wan.

1440
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,645
Promise-

1441
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:48,981
Promise me you will train the boy.

1442
02:04:49,065 --> 02:04:51,024
Yes, Master.

1443
02:04:54,612 --> 02:04:57,656
He is the chosen one.

1444
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,034
He... will bring balance.

1445
02:05:02,203 --> 02:05:04,121
Train him.

1446
02:05:31,107 --> 02:05:32,941
Now, Viceroy,

1447
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:36,486
you're going to have to go back to
the senate and explain all this.

1448
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:41,491
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise good-bye.

1449
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:58,800
We are indebted to you for your bravery,
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1450
02:05:58,885 --> 02:06:00,761
And you, young Skywalker.

1451
02:06:00,845 --> 02:06:04,932
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1452
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:13,982
Congratulations on your
election, Chancellor.

1453
02:06:14,067 --> 02:06:17,527
Your boldness has saved
our people, Your Majesty.

1454
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:20,030
It's you who should be congratulated.

1455
02:06:20,114 --> 02:06:24,076
Together we shall bring
peace and prosperity to the Republic.

1456
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:33,543
Confer on you the level of Jedi knight
the council does.

1457
02:06:33,628 --> 02:06:38,382
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1458
02:06:38,466 --> 02:06:40,425
I do not.

1459
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:42,552
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1460
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:47,933
The chosen one the boy may be.

1461
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:49,935
Nevertheless,

1462
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:52,938
grave danger I fear in his training.

1463
02:06:53,022 --> 02:06:56,608
Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1464
02:06:56,693 --> 02:06:58,610
I will train Anakin.

1465
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:04,116
Without the approval of
the council, if I must.

1466
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,618
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you.

1467
02:07:06,703 --> 02:07:08,620
Need that you do not.

1468
02:07:10,707 --> 02:07:14,001
Agree with you the council does.

1469
02:07:15,044 --> 02:07:18,380
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1470
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:47,951
What will happen to me now?

1471
02:07:48,036 --> 02:07:51,163
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1472
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:54,624
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1473
02:08:03,426 --> 02:08:06,511
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1474
02:08:06,596 --> 02:08:10,057
Mmm. Always two there are.

1475
02:08:10,141 --> 02:08:13,268
No more, no less.

1476
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:16,146
A master and an apprentice.

1477
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:18,148
But which was destroyed?

1478
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:21,151
The master or the apprentice?

1479
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:47,886
Hello, everybody!

1480
02:09:34,517 --> 02:09:36,434
Peace!
