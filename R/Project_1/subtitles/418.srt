1
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,331
He slaughtered our men. . .

2
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,543
our brothers. . .

3
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,921
our sons.

4
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,886
The dead cry out
to us for justice.

5
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,223
On their souls,
I swear to you.

6
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,311
The man who took
our loved ones from us. . .

7
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,523
the man who has brought us
such pain and sorrow.

8
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,818
We will find him.

9
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,696
We will bring him here.

10
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:06,370
We will not rest
until his blood flows
into this very ground.

11
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,875
We will have our revenge.

12
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,106
Sir? Excuse me.

13
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,483
Yeah.

14
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,402
The finish is included
in the cost of the wash.

15
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,780
That's okay,
I'd rather do it myself.

16
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,574
I'm a little
obsessive that way.

17
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,784
Lenore.
Bryan.

18
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:27,994
Hi. How are you?

19
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,328
Fine. You?

20
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,080
Mmm, good, good.

21
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,248
ls something up?

22
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,001
No.
It's Saturday,
two o'clock.

23
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,044
Kim's driving lesson?

24
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,879
Uh. . . Music lesson
got switched.

25
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,257
The Tuesday one
or the Friday one?

26
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,342
I have no idea.

27
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,262
You know how kids are.
Mmm-hmm.

28
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,014
Especially the ones
who are desperate

29
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,765
to pass their driving
test at the third try.

30
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:50,933
She's not desperate.

31
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,895
But she failed
the test twice, Lennie.
It's important.

32
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,190
So, where is she, really?

33
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,402
I've never been
a good liar, have I?

34
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,529
(CHUCKLING)
No, it's not your forte.

35
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,783
She's at her boyfriend.

36
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,289
She has a boyfriend?

37
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,332
Do you want to
come in for a drink?

38
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,460
Yeah.
I think you should.

39
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,299
Why didn't she tell me,
for God's sake?
(LENORE SIGHING)

40
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,760
She probably didn't
want you running
a full security check. . .

41
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,763
of everything he's done
since kindergarten.

42
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,226
But she's okay, right?

43
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,352
Yeah, she's okay.

44
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,403
Lennie, tell me
it's none of my business. . .

45
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,363
but are you okay?

46
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
No.

47
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,495
Not really.

48
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,830
We've separated.

49
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,794
Lennie, if there's
anything I can do. . .

50
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,671
Well, I better. . .

51
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,548
Thanks for the wine.

52
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,258
Bryan.

53
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:07,927
Don't.

54
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,512
I don't even know
where the kid lives.

55
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,058
You found her in a city
of 1 2 million people
within 72 hours.

56
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,101
Promise me.

57
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,977
I just told you--
Promise.

58
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,939
I'm going to
give her her space.

59
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,364
Let me show you
what I know

60
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,118
Let me take you
where I'll go

61
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,665
I want to, yeah,
share with you

62
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,043
Why won't you let me...

63
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,254
Um. . . Just wait a sec.

64
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,463
What?

65
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,553
I really like you.

66
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,055
What is it?

67
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,560
Um. . .
It's okay. It's okay.

68
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,187
Take all the time you need.

69
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,211
Hi.

70
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,172
May I help you?

71
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,427
ls Kim here?
Yeah, and you are. . .?

72
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,678
Her father.

73
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,098
Mr. Mills,
what a pleasure.
I'm Jamie.

74
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,059
Come in.

75
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,063
Can I get you anything?
A drink?

76
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,899
Just my daughter
will be fine.

77
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:46,942
Dad?

78
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,110
Hi.

79
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,445
What are you doing here?

80
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:51,864
I know how important
it is for you
to pass your test.

81
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,949
Wait. Kim, you don't
have a license?

82
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,743
Have you ever tried to
parallel park an Escalade?

83
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,287
I told you to take
the test with my car.

84
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,622
God. Dad.

85
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,752
Thank you.

86
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,130
A pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Mills.

87
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,807
BRYAN: Could we slow down
a little bit, please?

88
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,226
I can't believe
you just did that.
(SIGHING)

89
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,312
You're leaving on
fall break next week.

90
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,440
This is the only time
I can get to do this
before I go to Istanbul.

91
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,651
We planned this.
When you make plans,
you keep them.

92
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,235
No, Dad,
you planned this.

93
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,655
How did you
even find me?

94
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,864
Your mom and I
were talking.

95
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,282
Why didn't
you tell me you
have a boyfriend?

96
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,742
Because I knew
you'd overreact. . .

97
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,954
and I just want to
feel normal even if
I'm just pretending.

98
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,247
Remember to brake
before the stop--

99
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:42,998
Dad.

100
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,255
Mom doesn't know
where Jamie lives.

101
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,135
GPS?

102
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,514
I had it installed
in your phone.
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,850
You hear so many
scary stories of goings-on
with people your age--

104
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,186
Dad, I don't even know
how to start
feeling normal again. . .

105
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,688
but this
definitely isn't it.

106
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,608
Kim, you can move.

107
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,623
Use your side mirror.

108
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,556
Perfect. Why couldn't you
do that in the test?

109
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,391
I don't know.

110
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,060
Maybe I didn't really
want a license.

111
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,228
Listen. . .

112
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,023
of course I know
where you're coming from.

113
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,734
But you have to trust me
to figure this out.

114
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,070
Don't do this
again, please?

115
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,488
I won't.

116
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,159
And don't go running
a background check on him
with your friends.

117
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,660
I won't.

118
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,329
Okay.

119
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,331
See you Wednesday.

120
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,875
Two o'clock.

121
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,710
Love you.

122
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,087
Hey, I love you.

123
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,282
Yeah.

124
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,909
Sam. Hi. It's me.

125
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,455
Listen. I want you to
run a check on someone.
Jamie Conrad.

126
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,165
The usual.
Not too deep.

127
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,333
You got it.

128
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,542
Okay. Thanks.

129
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,642
Sir.

130
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,935
Thank you.

131
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,317
Mr. Pitrel?

132
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,861
I have a registered letter for you.

133
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,656
-Can you take that up, Sébastien?
-Yes, sir.

134
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:24,827
Here.

135
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,998
Sébastien?

136
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,566
Where is he?

137
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,025
I told you.

138
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,696
I don't know.

139
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:20,757
Where is he?

140
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,638
Okay.

141
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,769
You want to play with me.

142
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,438
No, no!

143
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,613
But I'm a good player, too.

144
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,580
Shh !

145
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,002
Look.

146
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,587
PITREL: No, no!

147
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,759
I guess the rules
are changing.

148
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,555
This man came to Paris.

149
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,310
He used a card
to come into our house

150
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,520
and kill my friends. .

151
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,356
And my brother.

152
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,905
This is your card.

153
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,122
Where is he?

154
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,125
Where is he?
(MUFFLED SCREAM)

155
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,217
LENORE: Stu,
where are you going?
Come back!

156
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,088
What's happened?
Are you okay?

157
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,007
Yeah, I'm great.

158
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,591
Come in. I'll get Kim.

159
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,926
Hey, hey, hey.

160
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,512
Lennie, talk to me.

161
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,018
We had this trip
planned to China
for Kim's spring break. . .

162
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,187
as a family, to try
and work things out.

163
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,856
And when Stu and I--

164
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,233
I just thought
it would be nice
for Kim and I

165
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,110
to be away together. . .

166
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,862
away from
all the tension.

167
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,697
He canceled everything.

168
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,615
All the reservations.

169
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,201
I just can't believe
he did this to us.

170
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,874
I'm just so tired.

171
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,043
Just the fighting,
the lawyers.

172
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,961
He's turned into
such a bastard.

173
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,671
I'm sorry, Lennie.

174
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,214
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,385
I'm sorry.
This is really
not your problem.

176
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,846
It's my turn to have--

177
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,349
I'll figure it out.

178
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,975
Look. . .

179
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,227
why don't you and
Kim come with me?

180
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,731
But we can't
impose on you.
You're working.

181
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,066
You're not imposing.

182
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,734
I'm working
for three days.

183
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,153
Then you can come over.

184
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,404
lt could be fun.

185
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,073
That's so sweet.

186
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,992
I don't know.
I can't think right now.

187
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,703
Sure, I understand.
No pressure.

188
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,915
I leave in the morning.
I work three days. Call me.

189
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,417
If you're coming,
I'll hang around.
If not, I'll come back.

190
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,585
That's it.

191
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,212
I'll go get Kim.

192
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,171
Okay.

193
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,672
Thank you, Bryan.

194
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,185
SAM: She is
definitely coming.

195
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,521
I don't know.
Sam, I don't know.
Oh, come on.

196
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,231
You should have insisted.
Mmm-hmm.

197
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,441
Come on, guys.
Cut me some slack.

198
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,859
She's going
through a hard time.

199
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,236
I didn't want to
make it harder on her.

200
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,029
She was confiding in me.

201
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,782
Oh ! I didn't know you guys
were still so cozy. . .

202
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,076
that she shares her
marriage issues with you.

203
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,452
Wait a minute.

204
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,039
I know you guys
were close, obviously,
but are you close again?

205
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,457
Close like--

206
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,126
I'll lay money
she's still got
something for him.

207
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,794
Don't go there, friend.

208
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,547
(CHUCKLING)
Maybe he still has
something for her!

209
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,299
Can we talk about basketball?
For God's sake, come on !

210
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,068
Istanbul.

211
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,829
Thank you, Mr. Mills.

212
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,665
You made my stay
feel very secure.

213
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,588
Thank you.
Have a safe trip home.

214
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,797
You also.

215
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,441
You've reached Lenore.
Leave a message
after the beep.

216
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,318
Hey, it's me.

217
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,861
No message from you. . .

218
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,530
so I guess you probably
found some place to go.

219
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,866
I hope things are
a little easier.

220
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,161
If you ever need
to talk or anything,
I'm here.

221
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,787
I mean, I'll be there.

222
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,790
I'll probably
ship out tomorrow.

223
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,043
No news from Kim.

224
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,295
I guess she's busy
with the boyfriend
and all.

225
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,546
Dad.

226
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,758
Surprise!

227
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,843
Oh, my God. Kim, baby.

228
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,888
Hey, Lennie.
Hello, Bryan.

229
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,724
I was just
leaving you a message.
When I didn't hear, it was--

230
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,059
We wanted to
surprise you.

231
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,810
Well, you succeeded.

232
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,396
You guys could have
been surprised.

233
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,814
I could have been out
of here and headed home.

234
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,399
Mom's been calling Sam.

235
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,068
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh. Yes.

236
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,528
We've been tracking you.

237
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,738
Exactly.
You're not the only one
who's got moves.

238
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,031
Apparently not.

239
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,659
Welcome to Istanbul.

240
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,251
Not too shabby, huh?

241
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:30,460
Wow.

242
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,421
Oh, my God.

243
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,799
Mom, look at this.

244
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,634
Oh, my God !

245
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,802
KIM: It's crazy, right?

246
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,136
LENORE: It's beautiful !

247
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,264
Thank you so much.
My pleasure.

248
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,765
Listen, I'll let you
get settled. . .

249
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,142
and I'll come
and collect you
in half an hour?

250
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,602
Okay.

251
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,939
Later.

252
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,542
Good morning.

253
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,215
Good.

254
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,633
Go.

255
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,467
Fast.

256
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,552
Let's go.

257
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,268
LENORE: Hey.
Hey.

258
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,853
You look great.

259
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:12,896
You, too.

260
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,024
So, where are we heading?

261
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,861
Well, I am
going nowhere.
I'm beat.

262
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,406
I'm just going to
take a nice long bath
and get into bed.

263
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,616
Lennie. Are you sure?

264
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Yeah.

265
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,953
I guess it's just
you and me, kiddo.

266
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,872
Anything special
you'd like to do?

267
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,875
Kind of. Maybe.

268
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,196
Hey.
Hey.

269
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,073
You ready to take off, too?

270
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,991
No, I thought I'd stick around
for a couple of more hours.

271
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,201
Really?
Yeah.

272
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,578
Cool.
No. Just kidding.

273
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,748
Come on. Let's go.
All right.
It's so crazy here.

274
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:21,923
On this side is Europe,
and the other side is Asia.

275
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,511
And every conquest since,
for the last 2,500 years. . .

276
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,931
whether it was
the West going East
or the East going West. . .

277
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,517
they all used this
very same waterway.

278
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,812
You want some tea, baby?
Yeah.

279
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,439
Just one, please.

280
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,607
How do you know
all this stuff?

281
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,276
How do I know it?

282
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,780
I read it in a book
on the flight over.

283
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,283
And you can
borrow it
if you wish.

284
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,325
Yeah, I would.

285
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,122
So, this Jamie. . .

286
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,167
ls it. . . serious?

287
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,793
That was a really
smooth transition.

288
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,298
I don't know.

289
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,133
It's only been
a few months.

290
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,135
Are you in love with him?

291
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,805
I guess I'm not sure yet.

292
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,349
Have you ever
been in love before?

293
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,856
Not the way that
Mom talks about it.

294
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,816
How does she
describe it?

295
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,819
She said when
you guys met. . .

296
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,240
that it was
super special.

297
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,201
Super special?
She said that?

298
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,662
I think the exact
word she used was. . .

299
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,998
"magical."

300
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,169
Magical, huh?

301
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,759
It's good to see
you again, my friend.

302
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,264
ls everything prepared?

303
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,391
As you requested.

304
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,726
Ah ! Perfect.

305
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,273
Yeah?
He's in the lobby.

306
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,983
Wait until he's outside.

307
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,110
And remember, alive.

308
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,781
He's on to me.
I'm leaving.

309
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,758
Hey.
BRYAN: Hi.

310
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,760
I thought we were
having lunch in the bazaar.

311
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,969
Um. . .

312
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,304
Jet lag just hit me. . .

313
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,557
so I figured I'd
veg out by the pool
and let you guys go.

314
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,975
Meet up with you later?

315
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,894
I guess. Okay with you?

316
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,145
Of course. It's fine.

317
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,105
Oh, okay. Bye.
Hey, Kim.

318
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,107
That book I was
telling you about?
It's on my dresser.

319
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,068
Definitely.

320
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,070
No adventuring.
I'll go call the car.

321
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,321
Have fun.

322
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,657
Hey, Kim.

323
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,158
(SOFTLY) I know
what you're doing.

324
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,785
(CHUCKLING) What?

325
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,001
Yeah?

326
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,504
The daughter
is staying here.
What can we do?

327
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,799
I want all three of them.

328
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,009
Yes?

329
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,348
She thinks we just
fell off the turnip truck.

330
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,557
What do you mean?

331
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,267
She's trying
to play cupid.

332
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,435
Oh, I see.

333
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,354
When you first
came back. . .

334
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,189
and said you wanted to
make up for all that time

335
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,108
that you lost with Kim?
Uh-huh?

336
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,819
I thought, "Right.
Three weeks, he's gone."

337
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,530
That was usually
about the limit
you stuck around.

338
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,115
Give or take a week.

339
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,285
Not too close.

340
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:04,372
LENORE: You really
proved me wrong.
I thought you'd never change.

341
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Why not?

342
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,501
I don't know.
Your personality.

343
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,462
When you commit
to something. . .

344
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,047
you focus all
your energy there.

345
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,549
Like a dog with a bone.

346
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,384
Nice analogy.

347
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,511
(CHUCKLING)
You know what I mean.

348
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,348
When you give,
it's 1 00 percent
of 1 00 percent.

349
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,393
If I was on to something,
it was just that thing.

350
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,229
Even though I tell myself
I should change. . .

351
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,732
I could never
give it up.

352
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,359
You gave us up.
Mmm-mmm.

353
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,862
No, never.

354
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,905
Not in here.

355
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,425
Driver, turn left.

356
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,597
Lennie, don't.

357
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,266
What?

358
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,855
Will you tell me
what's going on?

359
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,023
It's okay.

360
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,822
Where is he?

361
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,871
You see the gallery entrance
in the middle of the block?

362
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,998
Will you tell me
what's going on?
Do you see it?

363
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Yeah, I see it.

364
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,335
When we stop,
I want you to get out

365
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,045
of the car like
you're a shopper.

366
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,463
I want you
to go inside.

367
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:36,839
Will you tell me
what's going on?

368
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:37,965
Listen to me.

369
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,425
Lennie, there's
no time for this.

370
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,219
Just talk to me!
Listen.

371
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,138
When you exit the back
of the fabric store,
turn right.

372
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,973
Take the first
street on the right,

373
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,683
then left on
the very next street.

374
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,561
Go straight
until you come
to a set of steps.

375
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,023
There's a red corridor.
It's a lane.

376
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,526
When you exit the lane,
there's a cab stand.

377
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,944
Go back to the hotel.

378
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,571
Get Kim.
Get the head of
hotel security. . .

379
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,449
and demand that he
cordon off your room.

380
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,743
Do not open
the door for anyone.

381
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,830
No room service,
no police, no one.
You wait for me.

382
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,581
I can't believe
this is happening.

383
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,749
I need you to focus.

384
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,004
Are you ready?

385
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,047
No.

386
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,216
I need you to be ready.
I need you to be ready.

387
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:21,509
Come on, focus.

388
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,802
Driver, stop.

389
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:25,805
Okay, go.

390
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,431
Wait, what about you?

391
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,599
I'll be fine.

392
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,018
It's the guys following us
who are about to
have a problem.

393
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,354
When a dog
has a bone. . .

394
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,731
the last thing you
want to do is try
and take it from him.

395
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,738
Be careful.

396
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,243
Out of the car.

397
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,746
Come on. Move,
move, move!

398
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,918
Sir! Please.

399
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,296
Please. Sir!

400
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,258
He knows.

401
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,468
Do it now.

402
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,488
Come on.

403
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,261
Shit.

404
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,110
Come on, Kim,
answer the goddamn phone.

405
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,744
He's gone!

406
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,925
Oh, God, no!
Somebody help me!

407
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,136
The key!
Open the door, please!

408
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:12,555
Shit!

409
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,728
I'll blow his brains out.

410
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,945
Oh, Bryan !

411
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,155
Please!

412
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,991
Drop the gun.

413
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,413
I really wish
you were here.

414
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,082
Me too.
You have no idea.
(PHONE BUZZING)

415
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,293
What?

416
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,961
My dad's calling.

417
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,421
He's on a date
with my mom.

418
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,258
I'll call you right back.

419
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,176
Miss you. Bye.

420
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,347
How's it going?

421
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,849
Listen to me
carefully, Kim.

422
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,270
Your mother and I. . .

423
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,938
are going to be taken.

424
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,357
Daddy!

425
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,026
Oh, my God.

426
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,153
And people are going to
come for you, too.

427
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,031
Leave the place
where you are calmly.

428
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,158
Go to where the book
is I told you about.

429
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,870
There's a door.
Go into the room and
hide in the closet.

430
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,039
You got that?
Yes.

431
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,874
Good. I'll call you.

432
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,543
Go, now.

433

434
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:55,069
No!

435
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,547
She is in room 422.

436
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,591

437
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,275

453
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,685

Look!

463
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,738

very carefully.

and pull yourself together.

did they leave?

Yes. What do they want?

Okay.

What are we
going to do?

I want you to go
to the U.S. Embassy.
You'll be safe there.

490
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,422

491
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,760
I'll figure something out.

492
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,387
Where are you now?

493
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,389
I don't really know, Kim.

494
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,058
Dad, how can I tell them
where to find you, then?

495
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,018
You can't.
Now get going.

00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,439
No. Tell me what to do.

No, Kim.

500
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,443
Dad, if you
tell me what to do,
I can do it.

501
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,861
Kim, this is
not a game.

502
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,531
I know that.
It's my parents' lives.

503
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,367
Dad, please.

504
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,744
You're wasting time.

505
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,874
Please.

506
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,709
Tell me what to do.

507
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,630
Can you get out of
the closet safely?

508
00:43:59,053 --> 00:43:59,761
Yes.

509
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,807
If you can,
take the case with you.

510
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,767
Okay.

511
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:17,779
I'm out.

512
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:23,452
The combination
is 23-28-84.

513
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,668
Is it open?
Yeah.

514
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,587
Okay. Do you see a map?

515
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,463
Yeah.

516
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,630
Take the map.

517
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,258
You'll see a scale
on the top
in kilometers.

518
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,509
Do you see it?

519
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,138
Yeah, I see it.

520
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,432
Take a shoelace
from one of my shoes
in the closet.

521
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,684
Use it as a guide.

522
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,105
There's a pen
in the case.

523
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,356
Take it.

524
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,319
Draw a circle
with the hotel in
the center of it.

525
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:00,280
It's done.

526
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,282
Make the diameter
three kilometers.

527
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,493
You got that?

528
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:13,877
It's done.

529
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,962
Draw another circle
with the market
in the center.

530
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,549
Okay.

531
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,635
Do the circles
intersect at any points?

532
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,011
No.

533
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,306
Now, take one of
those little cans,

534
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,974
the ones with
the pins on the top.

535
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,309
It's a grenade.

536
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,978
I want you to
go to the balcony
with the grenade.

537
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,982
Is there a safe place
you can throw it?

538
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,904
There's a parking garage.

539
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,239
Anyone on it?

540
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:43,740
KIM: No.

541
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,742
I want you to
pull the pin
out of the grenade. . .

542
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,494
count to three
so I can hear it,

543
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,162
then toss it as
far as you can.

544
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,039
And then run back
into the room.

545
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,917
Keep the phone on
so I can hear
the explosion.

546
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,420
One. . .

547
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,672
two...

548
00:45:58,923 --> 00:45:59,589
three.

549
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,892
One, two, three. . .

550
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:15,855
Dad?

551
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,401
Now draw a circle
on the map with the hotel
in the middle. . .

552
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,029
and the circumference
at 4.5 kilometers.

553
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,747
Do the circles
intersect at any points?

554
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,791
Yeah, at two points.

555
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,918
I'm at one of the two
intersecting points.

556
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:40,797
Now go outside
and look at the flags
on the rooftops.

557
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,425
Do you see the flags?

558
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,053
Yes.
Are they in the wind?

559
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,056
Yeah.
Going east, right?

560
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,560
I think so, yeah.
How did you know?

561
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:54,769
Now look at the map.

562
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,898
I want you to go to
the point where the circles
intersect at the east.

563
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,650
I want you to take
one of the guns,

564
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,402
get to a rooftop,
wait for my call.

565
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,903
And two of the grenades.

566
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:07,991
Go to the rooftop at
the most easterly point.

567
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,160
Get up to the rooftop.

568
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,786
Wait for my call.

569
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,748
Be casual, Kim.
Blend in.

570
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,583
Okay.
(METAL CLANGING)

571
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:23,590
Dad?

572
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,780
Who are you?

573
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,616
Those clothes don't belong to you.

574
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,867
Help!

575
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,078
There's a thief in here!

576
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,393
You know this man?

577
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,154
This one?

578
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,406
No.

579
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,201
This one?

580
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,161
What do you want?

581
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,913
You recognize
none of them.

582
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,581
To you,
they were nothing.

583
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,917
But to other people. . .

584
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,671
they are sons
and grandsons.

585
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,257
Fathers and husbands.

586
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,426
And you killed them all.

587
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,722
Like they were
so many nothings.

588
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,897
(WHISPERING)
And this one?

589
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,108
You recognize him?

590
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,611
You do recognize him.

591
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,448
Him, you didn't just kill.
Him, you strapped to a chair.

592
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,326
You attached electric
cables to the chair.

593
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,370
You turned
the current on. . .

594
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:44,207
and you left it on
until his heart burst.

595
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:48,836
He's the one who
kidnapped dozens of girls
and ruined their lives.

596
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,838
He was my son.

597
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:55,093
Marko, from Tropojë.

598
00:50:55,928 --> 00:51:00,014
And I have come to
take you to Tropojë. . .

599
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:03,810
to face you to the people
whose lives you have ruined.

600
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,186
To give them justice.

601
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,063
You mean to
give them revenge.

602
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,359
lt if gives us peace
call it anything you wish.

603
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,238
I killed your son
because he kidnapped
my daughter.

604
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,409
I don't care
what he did !

605
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,246
I only know. . .

606
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,291
I will never see
his face again.

607
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,002
I will never
hear his voice.

608
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,302
And as you held
him responsible
for your daughter. . .

609
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,095
I hold you
responsible for him.

610
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,349
Your death will
not be quick.

611
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,184
lt will not be pleasant.

612
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,644
But before you die. . .

613
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,605
this is what
you will see.

614
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,149
Bring her in.

615
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,036
Bryan. . .

616
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:30,521
How long will it take
for the blood to
rush to her head. . .

617
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,190
and have no place to go?

618
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,695
About 30 minutes.

619
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,573
You are right.
You're an expert for this.

620
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,117
So you have
30 minutes
to watch her die.

621
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,745
She had nothing
to do with this.

622
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,830
Do what you
want with me.
Let her go.

623
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,749
Don't play
the hero with me.

624
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,834
Now we are going to
catch your daughter.

625
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,254
She will be sold
to the lowest brothel
in this world.

626
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,881
LENORE: No! No!

627
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:00,343
She will be abused
by so many men. . .

628
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:05,264
that she'll be nothing more
than a piece of meat
a dog would not have.

629
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:21,698
Don't listen
to them, Lennie.

630
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:23,366
Kim is safe.

631
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,617
I spoke with her.

632
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,327
She's safe.

633
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,372
You have to stay calm.
Breathe slowly.

634
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,540
You have to.

635
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,875
I won't let anything
happen to you,
or to her.

636
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,085
I promise.

637
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,217
MAN: Hello, Murad?
Shh !

638
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
Quiet.

639
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,137
We lost the girl.

640
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,472
The girl has gone.

641
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,474
I'll be back as
soon as we get her,
then we move.

642
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,059
Come on!

643
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,146
Hold on, Lennie.

644
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,794
Hold on, Lennie.
Hold on.

645
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,010
What's he doing?

646
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,013
Get out of the way!

647
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,807
Sorry! Sorry!

648
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,101
Come back!
You have to pay!

649
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,691
Lennie.

650
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:51,287
I'm with you, baby.
I'm here. I'm here.

651
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,313
Come on. Call.

652
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,732
Please, come on.

653
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:21,859
Lennie.

654
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:22,819
Bryan.

655
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,071
Lennie. Lennie.

656
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,823
I'm coming back.

657
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,669
Please.

658
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,128
I'm here.

659
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,255
Set off another grenade.

660
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,150
Dad?
You're close.

661
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,528
I want you to
keep moving east.

662
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,072
Count to 30
and then set off
another one.

663
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,700
One, two, three. . .

664
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,539
1 8, 1 9. . .

665
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,377
26, 27. . .

666
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,546
28, 29. . .

667
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,131
30.

668
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,930
Go out and check
what's going on.

669
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,106
Kim.
Yeah.

670
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:45,651
Look east.
Look for a white
cloud of steam.

671
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,654
I see it.

672
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,281
Run to it.
Tell me when
you're there.

673
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,167
I'm going down.

674
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,977
Dad.
Where are you?

675
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,145
I'm right by the steam.

676
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,189
Drop the gun
down the vent.

677
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,024
Oh, God, they're here.
They're coming.

678
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,901
Drop the gun,
Kim, and run.

679
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:30,571
Go.

680
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,657
Dad! They're coming.

681
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,234
I'm coming back.

682
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,807
Drop that.

683
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:05,434
On your knees!

684
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,564
Don't do this.

685
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,233
Please.

686
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,912
Dad?

687
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:27,498
Dad ! Dad !

688
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,000
Baby.

689
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,631
Where's Mom?
ls she okay?

690
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,551
She's safe.
She's safe.

691
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,104
Slow down,
slow down, slow down.

692
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,942
I've got a fare.

693
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:01,365
I'll be back.

694
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,459
That man had
the same tattoo
as the men in Paris.

695
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,087
It's not you
they want, Kim.
It's me.

696
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,147
I want you to wait here.
I'm going to get Mom.

697
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,441
Wait five minutes,
and if I don't show up. . .

698
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:39,111
I want you to
go straight here,
to the American Embassy.

699
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,614
Tell them
what happened.
Dad. . .

700
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,990
No time, Kim.
Give me your phone.

701
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,493
You wait five minutes,
not a moment longer.

702
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,163
No matter what happens,
time runs out, you go.

703
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,664
You understand me?

704
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,791
Okay.

705
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:29,972
No!

706
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,224
No.

707
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,143
Bryan !

708
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:54,580
Yes?

709
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:21,857
Move!

710
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,776
You killed him.
I had no choice. Move.

711
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,986
Where's Mom?
She's fine,
she's not far.

712
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,030
Where is she?
Come on, move!

713
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,117
I don't want
to do this.
Keep going, Kim.

714
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,118
Where are we going?

715
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,621
Go straight.
We have to go
to the Embassy.

716
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,500
I'm not sure I can.

717
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,460
Do you know
how to shoot?
No.

718
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:42,628
Then drive.

719
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,386
They escaped.

720
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,641
Officer down in Balat.

721
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,558
Copy.

722
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,519
Shit, cops.

723
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,979
I have to stop.

724
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,315
No, I just shot
one of them.
Now, go.

725
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,658
Come on, go!

726
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:36,723
Right.

727
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,188
Back, back, back!

728
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,024
Come on, move!

729
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,444
Come on, Kim.

730
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,453
Go, go!

731
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,540
Faster.

732
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,128
Keep going.

733
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,100
Left!
Yeah.

734
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,645
They're in the taxi!

735
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,066
Keep going.

736
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,236
Oh, no.
Shit.

737
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,821
Stay low. Keep going.

738
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:38,785
Come on, faster.
I can't.

739
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,913
You can do it!
I can't!

740
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,499
Come on, move! Move.

741
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,585
Dad !
Keep going.

742
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:47,961
KIM: Move!

743
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,088
Right.

744
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,143
Oh, shit.

745
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,855
No!

746
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,504
Come on, Kim. Move!

747
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,258
Go!
I'm trying.

748
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:44,518
Come on, keep going.

749
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,230
Turn left.

750
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,657
Shit.

751
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,118
Dad !

752
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,953
Keep going. Stay low.

753
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,426
Faster, Kim.
I can't.

754
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,261
(HORN BLARING)

755
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,266
Come on, faster!
Dad !

756
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,767
Keep going.

757
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,439
You can make it.

758
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:32,733
Do it.

759
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,508
Here! Don't stop.

760
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,593
But the soldiers.

761
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,011
They'll move.

762
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:04,389
Down, Kim !

763
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:24,993
MAN ON P.A. : Nobody shoot.

764
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,703
It's a suicide bomber.

765
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,793
Are you okay?

766
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,002
Yeah.

767
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:39,341
Keep your head
down, Kimmie.

768
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,682
Hey, Bry.

769
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,061
Sam, we're in a courtyard
of the U.S. Embassy
in Istanbul...

770
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,604
in a smashed-up car.

771
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:53,772
Don't ask.

772
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,233
Can you call someone
to make sure we
don't get shot?

773
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,442
Yeah, of course.

774
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,069
Thanks.

775
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,613
It's Bry.
He's in trouble
in Istanbul.

776
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,076
Mom didn't
get away, did she?

777
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:09,538
No.

778
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,373
Oh, God, Dad.

779
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:12,833
Tell me the truth.
ls she. . .

780
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,627
No, no, no, Kim.
No, she's not.

781
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,923
But they have her.

782
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,301
And they will use her
until they get
what they want.

783
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:25,178
Me.

784
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:31,309
You'll be safe
here in the Embassy
until I come back.

785
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:34,062
Kimmie, it's
going to be okay.

786
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,356
Nothing's okay.

787
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,900
Kim, listen.

788
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,405
I have to find them. . .

789
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:45,282
and bring your mom back.

790
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,117
And then I have to
make sure these people

791
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,869
never bother us
again in our lives.

792
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,581
What are you
going to do?

793
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,086
What I do best.

794
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,494
Mrs. Mills.

795
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:36,291
What should I do
with you, Mrs. Mills?

796
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,477
I have nothing
against you.

797
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,896
You didn't kill my son.

798
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:46,861
But your husband did.

799
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:51,408
Now, he betrayed
you by choosing

800
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:54,494
to save your daughter
instead of you.

801
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,914
He left you here
like a dog.

802
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,461
At least
my daughter
is still alive.

803
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:23,481
Mrs. Mills,
you're a good mother. . .

804
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,735
and a brave woman.

805
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,156
For that,
I'm going to send
you back home. . .

806
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,826
piece by piece.

807
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,151
Shut up!

808
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,495
Ohri, shoot this dog.

809
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,099
Go and see
what's happened.

810
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,028
Let's go.
Move through here,
to the hammam.

811
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:21,362
Hurry!

812
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,227
Mirko!

813
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,731
You stay here.

814
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:41,693
LENORE: No!

815
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:22,984
No.

816
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,105
No. Bryan !

817
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,107
MURAD: Come on !

818
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:38,643
You can't come in!

819
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,478
Get lost.

820
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,654
Lennie.

821
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,569
Lennie.

822
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,948
I'm here, baby.
I'm here.

823
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:24,368
I'm coming back, Lennie.
I'm coming back.

824
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,369
Okay?

825
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,702
What are you
waiting for?

826
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,580
You have other sons?

827
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:11,749
Two.

828
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:15,878
And if I killed you,
they will come
and seek revenge.

829
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:19,632
They will, for sure.

830
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,592
And I will
kill them, too.

831
01:26:23,386 --> 01:26:25,429
You can change that.

832
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,432
You can go home,
live your life.

833
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:31,435
Enjoy your sons,
your grandsons.

834
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:34,814
And my other son. . .

835
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,650
Marko.

836
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,155
The son you killed.

837
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:47,284
Am I supposed to
just forget it?

838
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,285
No.

839
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,704
You will just have
to live with it,

840
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:52,957
like the parents of all
those kidnapped girls.

841
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,961
Or you can die here.

842
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,337
What are you
telling me?

843
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:03,008
What I'm saying is,
if you give me your word. . .

844
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:08,973
I will throw down this gun
and simply walk away.

845
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:12,643
Why?

846
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:17,606
Because I am
tired of it all.

847
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,927
Lennie, I'm here.

848
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,013
I'm here, baby.
I'm here.

849
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,349
Come on, baby.

850
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,356
It's okay. It's okay.

851
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,192
It's okay.

852
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,653
We're safe.

853
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:49,490
Bryan. . .

854
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,533
Kim.

855
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:52,993
Kim. . .

856
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:57,915
She's safe.

857
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:09,969
We're all safe.

858
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,371
Okay.

859
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,500
Line it up.

860
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:44,628
That's it.

861
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:48,048
Now, begin to cut.

862
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,719
Not too fast,
not too fast.

863
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:55,848
Straighten it out.
Straighten, straighten.

864
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:58,892
That's it.

865
01:29:59,060 --> 01:29:59,935
Stop, stop, stop.

866
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,813
Perfect.

867
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,497
Perfect score.

868
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,374
Great!

869
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:24,793
Congratulations.

870
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:26,378
Thank you.

871
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,884
I was perfect.

872
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:35,846
I've been
saying that since
the day you were born.

873
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:38,057
Congratulations.

874
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,893
So, what would
you like to do
to celebrate?

875
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:42,853
Um. . .

876
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:44,438
I think I have an idea.

877
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,606
Yeah?

878
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:46,982
Yeah. I'll drive.

879
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,525
Of course.

880
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:01,538
Don't knock it
till you try it

881
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,166
Just come out to LA...

882
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:13,300
Here you go.
Three double-chocolate fudge.

883
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,178
Thank you.

884
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:17,638
Who's having
the strawberry?

885
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,431
I'm sorry,
but I just
ordered three.

886
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,558
Actually, the order
said four.

887
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,310
I ordered the fourth one.

888
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,645
For who?

889
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:27,815
Oh, Jamie.

890
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:28,857
Hey.

891
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,068
Hi.

892
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,277
Hi. Perfect timing.

893
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,612
Jamie.

894
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:35,906
It's cool if he
joins us, right?

895
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,074
Of course it is, honey.

896
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:38,575
Dad?

897
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,663
Of course it is, honey.
Behave.

898
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,123
It's nice to see
you again, sir.

899
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,835
Nice to see you, too.
Sit down.

900
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:49,711
Hi.

901
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,130
LENORE: We got you
a strawberry.

902
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:52,214
Oh, please.

903
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:53,298
Thanks, Dad.

904
01:31:53,466 --> 01:31:56,760
Don't shoot this one.
I really like him.

905
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:19,992
You know I'm not one
to break promises

906
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:27,291
I don't want to hurt you
but I need to breathe

907
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:34,882
At the end of it all
you're still my best friend

908
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:42,973
But there's something inside
that I need to release

909
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,812
Which way is right
Which way is wrong

910
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:52,858
How do I say that
I need to move on

911
01:32:53,693 --> 01:33:00,032
You know we're
headed separate ways

912
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:05,203
And it feels like I am
just too close to love you

913
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:12,628
There's nothing
I can really say

914
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:19,927
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more

915
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:22,220
Got to be true to myself

916
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:28,185
And it feels like I am
just too close to love you

917
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:31,521
So I'll be on my way

918
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:06,556
You gave me more
that I can return

919
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:14,564
Yet there's oh, so much
that you deserve

920
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:20,112
There's nothing to say
nothing to do

921
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:24,282
I've nothing to give
I must leave without you

922
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:29,621
You know we're
headed separate ways

923
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:36,753
And it feels like I am
just too close to love you

924
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:44,302
There's nothing
I can really say

925
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:51,518
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more

926
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,729
Got to be true to myself

927
01:34:54,439 --> 01:35:00,110
And it feels like I am
just too close to love you

928
01:35:00,903 --> 01:35:11,079
So I'll be on my way

929
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:22,632
And it feels like I am
just too close to love you

930
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,806
There's nothing
that I can really say

931
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:37,230
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more

932
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,524
Got to be true to myself

933
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:45,697
And it feels like I am
just too close to love you

934
01:35:46,532 --> 01:36:04,174
So I'll be on my way
