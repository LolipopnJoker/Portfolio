1
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,970
<i>I</i> used to think

2
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,701
<i>this was the beginning of your story.</i>

3
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,813
<i>Memory is a strange thing.</i>

4
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,279
<i>It doesn't work like I thought it did.</i>

5
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:55,156
<i>We are so bound by time, by its order.</i>

6
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,577
Okay.

7
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,314
Okay. Come back to me.

8
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,120
Come back to me.

9
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,092
Come back to me.

10
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,754
Stick 'em up!

11
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:37,432
Are you the sheriff
in this here town?

12
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,700
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna getcha!

13
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,364
No!

14
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:46,035
You want me to chase you?
You better run!

15
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,505
- Ah!
- Oh!

16
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,697
<i>I remember
moments in the middle.</i>

17
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,734
I love you.

18
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,970
I hate you!

19
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,983
<i>And this was the end.</i>

20
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,522
Shhh...

21
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,828
Come back to me.

22
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,661
You come back to me.

23
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,513
<i>But now I'm not so sure</i>

24
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,745
<i>I believe in beginnings and endings.</i>

25
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:05,919
<i>There are days that define
your story beyond your life.</i>

26
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,590
<i>Like the day they arrived.</i>

27
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,195
Good morning.

28
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,296
Morning.

29
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,869
Where is everyone?

30
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,543
Okay. Well, let's get started.

31
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,449
Today we are talking about Portuguese

32
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,544
and why it sounds so different

33
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,954
from the other Romance languages.

34
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:44,392
The story of Portuguese begins
in the kingdom of Galicia...

35
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,727
Sorry.
In the Middle Ages,

36
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,397
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

37
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,744
Any news you want to share?

38
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,148
Dr. Banks, can you turn
the TV to a news channel?

39
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,494
<i>But police have
already set up a blockade</i>

40
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:26,832
<i>here around the area.</i>

41
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,272
<i>As you can see,
we've got just about as close as we can,</i>

42
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,603
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

43
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,008
<i>Montana right now
is on complete lockdown.</i>

44
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,172
<i>The object apparently
touched down 40 minutes ago,</i>

45
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,113
<i>just north of I-94.</i>

46
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,618
<i>We're wailing to hear if this is perhaps</i>

47
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,349
<i>an experimental vessel</i> or...

48
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,515
Hold on, it...

49
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:50,288
<i>I'm learning that more objects
like this have landed in</i>

50
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,624
<i>as many as eight other locations</i>

51
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,688
<i>around the world.</i>

52
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,529
<i>Yes, can we?</i>

53
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:59,866
<i>This is from a site in Hokkaido.</i>

54
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,533
<i>This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.</i>

55
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,413
Okay. Um...

56
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,381
I'm sorry. Class is dismissed.

57
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,522
You are an idiot!
You drove right into me!

58
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,098
You just ruined my car!

59
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,930
<i>For now, we're simply
asking for cooperation</i>

60
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,096
<i>while authorities assess the object.</i>

61
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,366
<i>So, you're saying it's not ours?</i>

62
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,204
<i>Do you even know if it's from Earth?</i>

63
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,675
We're still collecting information.

64
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,010
<i>We're coordinating with other countries.</i>

65
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,877
<i>We're not the only ones to</i>

66
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,109
<i>have one of these in our backyard.</i>

67
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,208
<i>If this is
some son' of peaceful first contact,</i>

68
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,878
<i>why send 12?</i>

69
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,649
<i>Why not just one?</i>

70
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,400
Yeah, I know. I saw that, too.

71
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,339
Uh-huh.

72
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,243
Uh-huh. I don't know, Mom.

73
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,976
I'm watching
the same news coverage you are.

74
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,082
Well, Mom,
please don't bother with that channel.

75
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:03,025
How many times do I have to tell you?
Those people are idiots.

76
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,591
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

77
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,431
Okay. Exactly. So...

78
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,170
Um, me? Yeah, um, you know me.

79
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,103
I'm about the same.

80
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,271
Mom, I'm fine.

81
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,943
Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.

82
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,522
<i>And around eight
hours after landing,</i>

83
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,495
<i>there are still no signs
of what might be called</i>

84
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,964
<i>"first contact'</i>

85
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,867
<i>Now, the objects measure
at least 1,500 feet tall...</i>

86
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,529
<i>Two are reported
to have penetrated Russian airspace.</i>

87
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,040
<i>One in Siberia, and the other
off the coast of the Black...</i>

88
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,804
<i>"above the ocean.</i>

89
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,311
<i>So far, there are 12 unidentified objects</i>

90
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,711
<i>spread across the globe.</i>

91
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,374
<i>There is no obvious logic
to their locations</i>

92
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,146
<i>and no evidence that
the ships are even occu...</i>

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,712
<i>entertain the idea that
If it is a kind of vessel,</i>

94
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,224
<i>it may be unmanned.</i>

95
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,318
<i>Regardless, we have
a protocol for scenarios like this.</i>

96
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,063
<i>After Tuesday's
extraordinary events,</i>

97
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,126
<i>the President this morning has
declared a state of emergency,</i>

98
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,000
<i>with as many as 5,000 National Guard</i>

99
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,300
<i>being deployed to
the state of Montana alone.</i>

100
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,898
<i>Borders are closed
and flights have been grounded,</i>

101
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,774
<i>stranding millions of travelers.</i>

102
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,244
<i>Panic buying of gas, water and food</i>

103
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,077
<i>continues to escalate,</i>

104
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,949
<i>and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted</i>

105
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,954
<i>all caps on overtime
for law enforcement.</i>

106
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,920
<i>The ATF has put a temporary ban
on new gun licenses,</i>

107
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,016
<i>forcing many independent suppliers of</i>

108
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,116
<i>hunting equipment and firearms</i>

109
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,127
<i>to close their doors to the public.</i>

110
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,528
<i>Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...</i>

111
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,827
Two days...

112
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,663
<i>from the site of the 12 UFOs.</i>

113
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,361
And already, the public expects us

114
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,302
to know the answers.

115
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,338
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

116
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,269
We never formally met,

117
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,110
but two years ago,
you did some Farsi translations

118
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,545
for Army Intelligence.

119
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,774
Oh.

120
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,477
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

121
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,779
You made quick work
of those insurgents.

122
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,024
You are on the top of everyone's list

123
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,458
when it comes to translations.

124
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,225
And you have another
two years in your SSBI,

125
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,391
so you still have lop-secret clearance.

126
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,800
That's why I'm in your office
and not at Berkeley.

127
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,363
<i>Okay.-</i>

128
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,139
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

129
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,323
<i>Why are you here?</i>

130
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,991
<i>Can you... Can you understand us?</i>

131
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,864
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

132
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,385
Now you heard it.
What do you make of it?

133
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,283
Is that...

134
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,018
Yes.

135
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,960
How many?

136
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:38,900
- How many what?
- Um, how many, um, speaking?

137
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,530
Two.

138
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,376
Assume they were not speaking
at the same time.

139
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,574
Are you sure? Did they have mouths...

140
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,083
How would you approach
translating this'?

141
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,082
Do you hear any words? Phrases?

142
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,220
I don't... I don't know.

143
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,991
So what can you tell me?

144
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,292
I can tell you that it's impossible

145
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,334
to translate from an audio file.

146
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,495
I would need to be there,
to interact with them.

147
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,574
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

148
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,439
I didn't need it because
I already knew the language,

149
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,636
but this... This is... Ah...

150
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,909
I know what you're doing.

151
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,918
- Tell me what I'm doing.
- I'm not taking you to Montana.

152
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,053
It's all I can do
to keep it from turning into a tourist site

153
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,388
for everybody who has a TS clearance.

154
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,414
I'm just telling you what it would take

155
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,925
to do this job.

156
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,427
This is not a negotiation.

157
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,190
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

158
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,937
Good day.

159
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,806
Colonel?

160
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,977
You mentioned Berkeley.

161
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,378
Are you going to ask Danvers next?

162
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,779
Maybe.

163
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,285
Before you commit to him,

164
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,983
ask him the Sanskrit word
for war and its translation.

165
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,327
<i>An agreement on sharing
scientific discoveries</i>

166
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,026
<i>looks closer tonight,</i>

167
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,730
<i>as Russia and China join talks
at the United Nations.</i>

168
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,297
<i>Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis</i>

169
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,537
<i>as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell</i>

170
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,202
over 2, 000 points...

171
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,986
Morning.

172
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,154
Colonel?

173
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,333
<i>Gavisti.</i>

174
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,336
He says it means "an argument."

175
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,894
What do you say it means?

176
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,528
A desire for more cows.

177
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,163
Pack your bags.

178
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,736
- All right. Give me 20 minutes'?
- Takeoff in ten.

179
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,682
Dr. Banks.
Right this way, please.

180
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,423
<i>Contact and ready to approach...</i>

181
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,025
Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make
sure you're properly secured.

182
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,540
You okay?

183
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,585
<i>Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.</i>

184
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,591
<i>Language is the foundation
of civilization.</i>

185
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,025
<i>It is the glue
that holds a people together.</i>

186
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,960
<i>"R is me first weapon drawn
in a conflict"</i>

187
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,701
<i>Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.</i>

188
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,293
<i>That's quite</i> a <i>greeting.</i>

189
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,303
<i>Yeah, well, you wrote it.</i>

190
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,964
<i>Yeah.</i>

191
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,508
<i>It's the kind of thing
you write as a preface.</i>

192
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,636
<i>Dazzle them with the basics.</i>

193
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,805
<i>Yeah, it's great. Even if it's wrung.</i>

194
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,178
<i>It's wrong?</i>

195
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,549
<i>Well, the cornerstone of civilization
isn't language,</i>

196
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,121
<i>it's science.</i>

197
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,785
<i>Ian is a theoretical physicist
from Los Alamos.</i>

198
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,960
<i>You'll be reporting to me,
but you'll be working with him</i>

199
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,463
<i>when you're in the sheik.</i>

200
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,628
<i>That's what they're calling the UFO.</i>

201
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,166
<i>What do they wan!
And where are they from?</i>

202
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,732
<i>And beyond that, how did they get here?</i>

203
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,364
<i>Are they capable of
faster-than-fight travel?</i>

204
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,967
<i>We prepared
a list of questions to go over,</i>

205
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,207
<i>starting with a series of
"handshake" binary sequences...</i>

206
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,839
<i>How about we just talk to them</i>

207
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,315
<i>before we start throwing
math problems at them?</i>

208
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,680
<i>This is why you're both here.</i>

209
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,318
<i>I'll bring the coffee.</i>

210
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,394
<i>Coffee with some aliens.</i>

211
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,990
I want you to take
these two to Dr. Kettler.

212
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,859
YES, sir.

213
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,489
Follow the captain to medical.

214
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,295
It should take just a few minutes,

215
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,462
and then we'll get started.

216
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,811
We'll take care of your bag.
I'll lake your cell phones.

217
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,750
Cell phones!

218
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,819
Follow me.

219
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,654
Put these on. You're gonna
wear them at all times.

220
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,939
Sir, they're here.

221
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,505
Louise Banks?
Ian Donnelly?

222
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,476
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

223
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,843
- Last night.
- Same.

224
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,746
Last time
you did something stressful?

225
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,511
Does now count?

226
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,349
Just saying...

227
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,184
Uh, who was being carted off
in the medevac?

228
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,747
Not everyone is able to
process experiences like this.

229
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,759
I'm gonna get some blood from you

230
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,420
and give you an immunization dose

231
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,691
that covers a battery of bacterial threats.

232
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,859
Could you sign these, please?
And roll up your sleeves.

233
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,368
Either of you claustrophobic?

234
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,870
- No.
- No.

235
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,429
Currently taking any medications?
Allergies?

236
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,031
Pregnant?

237
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,542
No.

238
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,703
The booster is a kick to your system,

239
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,940
so you may experience
some side effects,

240
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,606
nausea, dizziness, headaches,

241
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,379
a ringing in your ears,
like you have tinnitus.

242
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,443
They wouldn't go, either way.

243
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,729
You see what's happening to him?

244
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,233
How does this even work?

245
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,433
The readings do not change,

246
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,629
<i>but I don't know,</i>

247
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,966
<i>it's like we're insects
on a piece of paper,</i>

248
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,131
<i>and they're easing us out of the house.</i>

249
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,971
<i>A1 exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds,</i>

250
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,308
<i>gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.</i>

251
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,474
Have you found
a scientific explanation for it?

252
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:47,983
Like, is it for them?

253
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,984
<i>Uh, no. We think it's for us.</i>

254
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,749
<i>Air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,</i>

255
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,485
<i>so after about two hours,
we run out of oxygen.</i>

256
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:59,154
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air into a room.

257
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,753
Atmosphere...

258
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,923
Excuse me?

259
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,094
If their atmosphere is
different from Earth,

260
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,603
it would certainly take hours

261
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,936
to rebalance their O2 content
and pressure for us

262
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,941
every time they open their door.

263
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,443
So, they could suffocate us
if they wanted.

264
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,342
This is Agent Halpern
with the CIA.

265
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,779
Let me get you two to your stations.

266
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,112
Yes, sir.

267
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,948
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

268
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,783
What do they want?
Where are they from?

269
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,187
Why are they here?

270
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,518
This is the priority.

271
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:29,524
Everyone, this is Dr. Ian Donnelly.

272
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,288
He'll be running this team here.

273
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,455
Have they responded to anything?

274
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,123
Shapes, patterns, numbers, Fibonacci?

275
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,499
We can't tell what they're saying

276
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,469
when they respond to "hello," so...

277
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,203
Don't get ahead of yourself.

278
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,033
What have you figured out?

279
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,169
We're just getting started.
Good morning!

280
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,182
This is Dr. Louise Banks.
She'll be heading your team.

281
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,683
It's a pleasure meeting you.

282
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,345
Dr. Banks is
taking over the mission from Dr. Walker.

283
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,389
That's a 15-minute warning.

284
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,390
You scuba-dive before?

285
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,854
What kind of radiation exposure
are we walking into?

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,230
Nominal. These are just for safety.

287
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,996
So, is there any physical
contact with the, um...

288
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,766
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

289
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,738
There's a wall. Like, a glass wall.

290
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,503
You can't get to them.

291
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,541
So, what do they look like?

292
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,741
You'll see soon enough. Hurry up.

293
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,298
The <i>suits</i> are clumsy at <i>first,</i>

294
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,430
<i>but you get used to them.</i>

295
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,806
<i>I'll open a second vehicle.</i>

296
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,248
<i>We'll be there in a few minutes.</i>

297
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:04,413
<i>Make sure you hold on to something.</i>

298
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,204
Copy, Condor.
We <i>will</i> observe, but not initiate. Over.

299
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,445
Watch your step.

300
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,453
<i>We'll keep
Alpha channel open. Over.</i>

301
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,045
<i>Alpha, be advised.
Humidity increased since yesterday.</i>

302
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,146
<i>Every 18 hours,</i>

303
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,454
<i>the door opens up at the bottom.</i>

304
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,692
<i>That's where we go in.</i>

305
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,166
<i>Zero movement.
Alpha detail, clear to proceed. Over.</i>

306
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,542
Copy, Condor.

307
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,477
<i>Beginning our ascent now. Over.</i>

308
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,881
Ten feet.

309
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,388
<i>Five</i> feet.

310
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,059
<i>Two, one...</i>

311
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,249
<i>Alpha clear to enter antechamber.</i>

312
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,858
<i>Moving into position.</i>

313
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,466
<i>Thirty feel from target.</i>

314
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,370
<i>Suit telemetry now full strength,</i>

315
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,067
<i>despite unknown interference.</i>

316
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,879
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

317
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,970
<i>20.3%.</i>

318
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,637
<i>No known contaminates. Over.</i>

319
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,519
<i>Radio signals are decreasing.</i>

320
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:34,621
90%, 85%..

321
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,209
Yeah, that just happened.

322
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,802
<i>All right, let's move!</i>

323
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,000
<i>Time is wasting.</i>

324
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,208
<i>You ready? You ready?</i>

325
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,713
<i>Let's do it!</i>

326
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,181
<i>Condor, I'm proceeding first
with Captain Marks, over.</i>

327
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:37,017
<i>Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over!</i>

328
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,221
It's all good, sir.

329
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,729
<i>You can proceed.</i>

330
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,561
<i>Stand by! Okay, bring ii up.</i>

331
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,431
<i>Vitals are low.</i>

332
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,373
<i>Radio signal strength
stable at 75%. Over.</i>

333
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,877
You okay?

334
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,849
Yeah.

335
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,578
Dr. Banks?

336
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,518
<i>You can do this. Come on.</i>

337
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,357
<i>I</i> don't <i>know.</i> I... <i>I</i> think...

338
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,731
<i>Grab her.</i>

339
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,142
<i>Donnelly, are you all right?</i>

340
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,479
Dr. Donnelly, you good?

341
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,423
<i>Dr. Donnelly,
are you all right?</i>

342
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,463
<i>Please respond. Over.</i>

343
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,155
Yeah.

344
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,158
<i>Holy fuck!</i>

345
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,304
<i>We're gonna go down there,</i>

346
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,140
<i>and you're gonna start your job.</i>

347
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,941
- Okay.
- Okay?

348
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,106
<i>Okay-</i>

349
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,341
<i>Everybody, move out!</i>

350
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,149
<i>Alpha detail is in position.</i>

351
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,777
<i>Team is in position.</i>

352
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,343
<i>We're on the move.</i>

353
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,228
Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.

354
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,002
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

355
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,606
So, what happens now'?

356
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,037
They arrive.

357
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,333
<i>Dr. Banks?</i>

358
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,475
Dr. Banks?

359
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,315
You can start.

360
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,956
<i>In airlock.</i>

361
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,689
<i>Do not stop until you have
passed the airlock door.</i>

362
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,787
<i>Do noi attempt to remove hazmat suits</i>

363
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,767
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

364
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,325
<i>Hazmat suits</i>

365
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,338
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

366
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,271
Wait. Just a minute. Just a minute.

367
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,110
Clear.

368
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,737
- All right.
- Step on out, please.

369
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:34,880
Now hold that.

370
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,621
Am I fired?

371
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,396
You're better than the last guy.

372
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,024
That doesn't
make me feel any better.

373
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,731
You both have till 02:00 hours
to figure something out.

374
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,240
Okay. What happens then?

375
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,003
You go back in.

376
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,038
<i>Violence continues to spread</i>

377
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,945
<i>across the US today in
the wake of the 12 landings.</i>

378
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,346
<i>The president has declared</i>

379
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,079
<i>a mandatory dusk-to-dawn curfew</i>

380
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,552
<i>after the crackdown
by the National Guard Miler!</i>

381
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,386
<i>To prevent</i> a <i>third night of
footing across the country.</i>

382
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,427
<i>In North Dakota, 144 members of</i>

383
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,223
<i>the Saint Lawrence Pentecostal Cult</i>

384
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,231
<i>are feared dead after they set
their compound ablaze.</i>

385
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,733
<i>Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens</i>

386
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,463
<i>set in motion</i> a <i>prophesy that...</i>

387
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,415
Uh, we're up in 15.
You got any new intel?

388
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:20,486
<i>Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.</i>

389
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,223
Where does that get you?

390
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,960
<i>Well, they play audio back at us,</i>

391
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,160
<i>from an unseen source.</i>

392
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,759
Audio of what?

393
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,067
<i>Uh, it's bits of conversation
from the room.</i>

394
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,005
<i>Random clips of dialogue.</i>

395
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,343
<i>Really, we have nothing;.</i>

396
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,180
<i>T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.</i>

397
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,251
<i>T-minus 14 minutes to shell access.</i>

398
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,272
<i>T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.</i>

399
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,336
<i>T-minus 9 minutes to shell access.</i>

400
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,937
<i>What's that for?</i>

401
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,949
<i>A visual aid.</i>

402
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,679
<i>Look, I'm never
gonna be able to speak their words,</i>

403
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,345
<i>if they are talking,</i>

404
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,287
<i>but they might
have some sort of written language</i>

405
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,292
<i>or basis for visual communication.</i>

406
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,794
<i>Okay. Let's get started.</i>

407
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,234
<i>Human.</i>

408
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,592
<i>"Human."</i>

409
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,842
<i>I'm human. What ave you?</i>

410
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,746
<i>Human.</i>

411
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,233
<i>Oh my God!</i>

412
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,467
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

413
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,976
<i>Yes, sir!
It's uploading back is base camp.</i>

414
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,745
<i>Louise, that's incredible.</i>

415
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,087
<i>Human.</i>

416
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,203
<i>Human.</i>

417
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,617
<i>Okay, slow down now.</i>

418
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:04,951
Slow down.

419
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,469
<i>I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,</i>

420
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,009
<i>but Dr. Banks,
is this really the right approach?</i>

421
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:30,342
<i>Trying to teach them
how to speak and read?</i>

422
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,210
<i>That's gotta take longer.</i>

423
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:35,580
<i>You're wrong. It's faster.</i>

424
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:41,590
Everything you do in there,
I have to explain to a room full of men

425
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,522
whose first and last question is...

426
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,652
"How can this be used against us?"

427
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,425
So you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

428
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,492
Kangaroo.

429
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,831
What is that?

430
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,394
In 1770,

431
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,268
Captain James Cook's ship ran aground

432
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,670
off the coast of Australia,

433
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,505
and he led a party into the country,

434
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,203
and they met the Aboriginal people.

435
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,769
One of the sailors pointed at

436
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,609
the animals that hop around

437
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,410
and put their babies in their pouch,

438
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,178
and he asked what they were,

439
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,379
and the Aborigine said, "Kangaroo."

440
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,451
And the point is'?

441
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,323
It Wasn't till later
that they learned that

442
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,089
"kangaroo" means
"I don't understand." So,

443
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,263
I need this so that we don't
misinterpret things in there.

444
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,890
Otherwise, this is gonna
take 10 times as long.

445
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,064
I can sell that for now.

446
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,494
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary words

447
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,939
before the next session.

448
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,533
Fair.

449
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,045
And remember what happened
to the Aborigines.

450
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,080
A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out.

451
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,891
It's a good story.

452
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,392
Thanks.

453
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,953
It's not true.

454
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,157
But it proves my point.

455
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,273
<i>We think
we were able to reproduce</i>

456
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,114
<i>some prime number sequences
back at them.</i>

457
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,482
<i>So that's something.</i>

458
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,148
Well, congratulations.
You're a parrot.

459
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,891
<i>It's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard,</i>

460
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:24,985
<i>don't you see?</i>

461
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,085
<i>They cam seem to follow our algebra,</i>

462
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,031
<i>but complex behaviors, that clicks.</i>

463
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,933
Well that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

464
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,011
Problem is,
not everyone shares our policy

465
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,015
of being open with the aliens.

466
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,106
Have you met General Shang?

467
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,345
The call sign for him is Big Domino.

468
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,681
Whatever Shang does,

469
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:53,517
at least four other nations will follow.

470
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,784
Louise? We have to gain ground today.

471
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,291
<i>Okay.-</i>

472
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:00,795
- You have a vocabulary list for me?
- I do.

473
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:08,301
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

474
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,861
Yes, so that we can learn

475
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,634
their names if they have names,

476
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,538
and then introduce pronouns later.

477
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,201
These are all grade-school words:

478
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,643
eat, walk.

479
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,677
Help me understand.

480
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,380
Okay. Um...

481
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,555
Oh, no, no, no! Not the top!

482
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,195
Okay, this is where
you wanna get to, right?

483
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,757
- That is the question.
- Okay.

484
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,063
So, first, we need to make sure that

485
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,230
they understand what a question is.

486
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,104
Okay, the nature of
a request for information

487
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:48,768
along with a response.

488
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:53,076
Then, we need to clarify
the difference between

489
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:56,277
a specific "you" and a collective "you,"

490
00:42:56,374 --> 00:43:00,550
because we don't wanna know
why Joe Alien is here,

491
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,524
we want to know why they all landed.

492
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,028
And purpose requires
an understanding of intent.

493
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,393
We need to find out:

494
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,399
do they make conscious choices?

495
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,594
Or is their motivation so instinctive

496
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,728
that they don't understand
a "why' question at all?

497
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,295
And... And biggest of all,

498
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,602
we need to have enough
vocabulary with them

499
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,437
that we understand their answer.

500
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,606
I get it.

501
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,047
Stick to your list.

502
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,608
Just

503
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,411
don't add anything to it.

504
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,938
Mare at <i>2.97.</i>

505
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,097
<i>21.4%. Over.</i>

506
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,766
<i>Condor, Alpha's now in the nave.</i>

507
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:56,674
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

508
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,269
Let's get started.

509
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:12,291
<i>Louise. Louise. I am Louise.</i>

510
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,769
<i>What is that?</i>

511
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,467
<i>Is that a new symbol? I can'! tell.</i>

512
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,269
<i>I don't know.
I think it's the symbol for human again.</i>

513
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,641
<i>It just has a lime um on the end,</i>

514
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,644
<i>maybe to indicate</i> a <i>question.</i>

515
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,442
<i>1 don't know.</i>

516
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:34,710
<i>I don? know, Louise.</i>

517
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,149
<i>I think they're getting confused.</i>

518
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,686
Dr. Banks,

519
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,983
<i>perhaps we should
move on to the next word.</i>

520
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,806
<i>Dr. Banks!</i>

521
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,301
<i>It's</i> okay.

522
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,468
<i>What's going on?</i>

523
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,877
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

524
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,243
Yeah, I'm fine.

525
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:08,976
<i>Are you insane?</i>

526
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,711
They need to see me.

527
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,651
<i>She's taking off her hazmat suit.</i>

528
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,380
Is it okay?

529
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,624
<i>You're risking contamination.</i>

530
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,093
They need to see me.

531
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,662
Dr. Banks...

532
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,889
<i>Dr. Banks.</i>

533
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:24,262
<i>She's walking
towards the screen.</i>

534
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:28,728
<i>Should we abort?</i>

535
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,238
<i>Recourse noted.
Stand by for further orders.</i>

536
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,935
<i>Go back to your stations.</i>

537
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:51,953
Now that's a proper introduction. Hey.

538
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,030
Louise.

539
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,165
I am Louise.

540
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,503
Ian, do you want to introduce yourself?

541
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,476
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

542
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,443
Louise.

543
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,815
<i>Screw it!</i>

544
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,652
<i>Everybody dies, right?</i>

545
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,865
<i>Sir, Donnelly is
taking off his hazmat suit.</i>

546
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,197
<i>Permission to abort?</i>

547
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,965
<i>Continue the session.</i>

548
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,716
Ian.

549
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,347
Louise.

550
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,422
You...

551
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,353
Who are you?

552
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,388
I think those are their names.

553
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,762
They have names.

554
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,197
So, what are we gonna call them?

555
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,859
I don't know.

556
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,365
I was thinking Abbott and Costello.

557
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,771
Yeah.

558
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,606
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

559
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,945
I like it.

560
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,642
Wow!

561
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,297
Team 1, exit your vehicle

562
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:21,063
<i>and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.</i>

563
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,736
<i>Leave your respirator on until
you reach the equipment</i> room.

564
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:01,603
I know. Shhh!

565
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,108
<i>Team 2, exit your vehicles</i>

566
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,644
<i>and continue to
the decontamination tent.</i>

567
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,281
<i>Leave your respirators on</i>

568
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:16,984
<i>and do not hesitate</i>

569
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,890
<i>until you have reached
the equipment room.</i>

570
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:23,488
How do you feel?

571
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,331
<i>Overworked.</i>

572
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,392
Well, I guess I don't need to tell you

573
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,971
you're putting yourself at risk.

574
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,539
There's no signs of
radiation poisoning yet.

575
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,339
We'll see how your blood tests look.

576
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,971
For now, I'm gonna
give you another boost.

577
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,481
<i>Okay.-</i>

578
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,347
No radiation.

579
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,079
Nothing else we can detect either,

580
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,552
but I'd give them a strong
cocktail, regardless.

581
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:49,420
It's the first time
we've made significant progress.

582
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:55,027
All right. We'll take the risk.

583
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,428
Okay, honey...

584
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:57,898
<i>What is going on there?</i>

585
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,094
Honey...

586
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,361
<i>Just tell me!</i>

587
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,370
You don't need to worry, okay?

588
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:05,100
<i>- How can I not worry?</i>
- Just <i>calm</i> down.

589
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,731
Just calm down.

590
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,607
<i>Becky asked me
if the monsters are going to kill Daddy!</i>

591
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,272
Honey, it's not gonna happen.

592
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,182
<i>Just stay safe.</i>

593
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:18,684
You don't need to worry.

594
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,744
<i>Please! I'm so scared!</i>

595
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,783
<i>All junior xenolinguistics</i>

596
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:28,056
<i>and science personnel must observe</i>

597
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,758
<i>general curfew
unless expressly authorized</i>

598
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,460
<i>for extended work hours by unit COs.</i>

599
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:37,198
<i>Curfew in effect as of 2200 hours.</i>

600
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:41,870
<i>Notice to all late workers,
fire watchers and night staff</i>

601
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:46,381
<i>Effective immediately,
midnight rations will be served all night.</i>

602
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,624
<i>Here are some of the many things</i>

603
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,756
<i>we don't know about heptapods.</i>

604
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:42,133
<i>Greek. Hepta, "Seven." Pod, "Foot."</i>

605
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,796
Seven feet. Heptapod.

606
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,833
<i>Who are they?</i>

607
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,775
<i>Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way</i>

608
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,609
<i>is hampered by the fact that,</i>

609
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,616
<i>outside being able to see them
and hear them,</i>

610
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:58,778
<i>the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.</i>

611
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:04,050
<i>The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown,</i>

612
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:07,357
<i>The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.</i>

613
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:10,694
<i>Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,</i>

614
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:13,359
<i>they do so without detection.</i>

615
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,960
<i>The air between the shells is untroubled</i>

616
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,006
<i>by sonic emission or light wave.</i>

617
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,042
<i>Are they scientists? Or tourists?</i>

618
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,543
<i>H they're scientists,</i>

619
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,910
<i>they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.</i>

620
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,316
<i>Why did they park where they did?</i>

621
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,878
<i>The worlds most decorated
experts can't crack that one.</i>

622
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,548
<i>The most plausible theory is</i>

623
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,149
<i>that they chose places on Earth</i>

624
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,728
<i>with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.</i>

625
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,820
<i>But there are exceptions.</i>

626
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,888
<i>The next most plausible theory is that</i>

627
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,558
<i>Sheena Easton had a hit song</i>

628
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,159
<i>at each of these sites in 1980.</i>

629
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,898
<i>So, we just don'! know.</i>

630
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,907
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

631
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,070
<i>Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.</i>

632
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,841
<i>The first breakthrough was</i>

633
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,509
<i>to discover that there's no correlation</i>

634
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:06,349
<i>between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.</i>

635
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,602
<i>Unlike all written human languages,</i>

636
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:26,197
<i>their writing is semasiographic.</i>

637
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,767
<i>It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.</i>

638
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,409
<i>Perhaps they view our form of writing</i>

639
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,817
<i>as a wasted opportunity,</i>

640
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:41,480
<i>passing up a second
communications channel.</i>

641
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,460
<i>We have our friends in Pakistan to thank</i>

642
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:52,557
<i>for their study of how heptapods write,</i>

643
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:56,571
<i>because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.</i>

644
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,465
<i>Like their ship or their bodies,</i>

645
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,943
<i>their written language has no forward</i>

646
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:05,344
<i>or backward direction.</i>

647
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:09,315
<i>Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,</i>

648
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,819
<i>which raises the question,
"ls this how they think?"</i>

649
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,788
<i>Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,</i>

650
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,418
<i>starring from either side.</i>

651
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,657
<i>You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,</i>

652
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,529
<i>as well as how much space
they would occupy.</i>

653
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,795
<i>A heptapod can write
a complex sentence</i>

654
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,999
<i>in two seconds, effortlessly.</i>

655
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,974
<i>It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.</i>

656
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:38,036
<i>Next, expanding vocabulary.</i>

657
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,913
<i>Louise thinks it could
easily take another month</i>

658
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,439
<i>to be ready for that.</i>

659
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,462
Hey...

660
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,131
Oh, hey.

661
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:05,400
Weber's looking for you.

662
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,203
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

663
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,303
Come on up!

664
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,805
Thanks.

665
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,748
Nice out here, huh?

666
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:22,221
Yeah, it's a nice view.

667
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,485
Away from the noise.

668
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,760
You know, I was just thinking about you.

669
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,730
You approach language
like a mathematician.

670
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:37,999
You know that, right?

671
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,336
I will take that as a compliment.

672
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:41,909
Yeah, well, it is.

673
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:47,913
As I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

674
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:50,076
that I didn't even know existed,

675
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,914
it's like, "What?"

676
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,022
I guess that's why I'm single.

677
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:59,185
Trust me, you can
understand communication

678
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,921
and still end up single.

679
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,436
I feel like everything
that happens in there

680
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,635
comes down to the two of us.

681
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,703
Yeah, that's a good thing though, right?

682
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,248
You and I?

683
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:28,053
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

684
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:29,715
Thank God I've got you!

685
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,232
<i>Tonight,</i>

686
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:45,239
<i>the first photograph
of the aliens goes viral.</i>

687
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,071
<i>Biological contamination
is a major risk factor</i>

688
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,405
<i>at the Montana site.</i>

689
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,571
<i>So say environmental pressure groups.</i>

690
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,477
<i>800, 000 march on Washington</i>

691
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,141
<i>to protest the government's
handling of the crisis.</i>

692
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,083
<i>All this, and more special coverage.</i>

693
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:02,956
<i>First contact with
whoever it is that is inside that thing,</i>

694
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,323
<i>and who's running the show?</i>

695
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,654
<i>The government.</i>

696
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:07,751
<i>That's right, folks, the same government</i>

697
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,424
<i>who ruined our healthcare
and bankrupted our military.</i>

698
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:11,591
<i>Look at these people!</i>

699
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,430
<i>Most of them don't even have guns!</i>

700
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,492
<i>We could be facing a full-scale invasion.</i>

701
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,333
<i>Our president's willing to sit back</i>

702
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,600
<i>and let them waltz in
and take our country.</i>

703
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,939
<i>We are failing asleep
at the wheel, people!</i>

704
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:24,273
<i>You know what I'm talking
about. I know you do.</i>

705
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,678
<i>What if the smartest thing
we could do right now</i>

706
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,613
<i>would be to give them</i> a <i>show of force?</i>

707
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,674
<i>I'm talking about</i> a <i>shot across the bow.</i>

708
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:31,775
<i>What do you think?</i>

709
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,321
<i>Caller No. 1, you're on the air.</i>

710
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,651
<i>What do you think?</i>

711
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,646
<i>What's this word?</i>

712
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,157
Planet.

713
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,735
That's, like, um...
The Earth is a planet.

714
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:32,837
<i>Want to see my project
for Miss Garriott's class?</i>

715
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,610
Yeah, little nose.

716
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,350
We had to make up our own TV show.

717
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,412
If we had one.

718
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:43,992
And who are those two people?

719
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,424
That's you and Dad.

720
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,926
The show is called

721
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,190
"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."

722
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,095
Oh!

723
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,190
Well, it's lovely.

724
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,637
Okay...

725
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,199
Um...

726
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,943
You know it's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

727
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:06,537
I know. I'm not.

728
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,779
'Cause we both love you very much.

729
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:13,445
I know. It's just a cartoon. It's not real.

730
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,113
Louise?

731
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:20,661
You all right?

732
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,825
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

733
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:31,068
I'm not sure it's something
I can... I can explain.

734
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,904
When was
your last checkup with Dr. Kettler?

735
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,738
I'm okay.

736
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,142
I'm gonna get some air.

737
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,237
- I'm okay.
- All right.

738
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,010
I'm fine. Yep.

739
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,475
<i>How you feeling?</i>

740
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,206
Um...

741
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:50,918
I need some sleep, but I'm fine.

742
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,384
Yeah.

743
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,916
You know, I was doing
some reading, um,

744
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,423
about this idea

745
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,893
that if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

746
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,555
then you can actually rewire your brain.

747
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,564
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

748
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:07,600
Mm-hmm.

749
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,329
The theory that, uh...

750
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,394
It... It's the theory that, uh,

751
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,201
the language you speak determines

752
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:14,708
how you think and...

753
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,244
Yeah. It affects
how you see everything.

754
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:18,608
It was, uh...

755
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,739
I'm curious...

756
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,340
Are you dreaming in their language?

757
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:36,188
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

758
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:41,362
I don't think that that
makes me unfit to do this job.

759
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,814
Did you sleep?

760
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,117
A little.

761
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,491
Do you know Mandarin?

762
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:11,232
It is shifting.

763
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,402
The voice you're about to hear

764
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,807
belongs to a Chinese military chief...

765
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,239
General Shang.

766
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,805
Pull <i>n</i> up!

767
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:33,414
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

768
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,422
if you want to look.

769
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,980
Wait, go back.

770
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:39,984
<i>Stop-</i>

771
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,922
He's saying that each of the 12

772
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,967
is offering advanced technology.

773
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,468
Go back again. And play.

774
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,663
Um...

775
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:58,168
"Our science team
is attempting to decode the sets."

776
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:01,172
"Sets." I don't know what that means.

777
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,841
Something about advantage,

778
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,783
suits, honor and, uh, flowers.

779
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,378
I don't...

780
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:10,358
I don't know. That's all.

781
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,859
I don't know what it means either.

782
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,327
An hour ago, China mobilized forces.

783
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:17,865
And now, Russia's following suit.

784
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,298
Shang's about to start something.

785
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,359
Following suit. Suits.

786
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,035
Suits, honor, flowers...

787
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,872
Colonel, those are
all tile sets in mah-jongg.

788
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,511
God, are they...

789
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,744
Are they using a game
to converse with their heptapods?

790
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:40,412
Maybe. Why?

791
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,923
Well, let's say that
I taught them chess instead of English.

792
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,050
Every conversation would be a game.

793
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:49,221
Every idea expressed through
opposition, victory, defeat.

794
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:50,593
You see the problem?

795
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,394
Hmm...

796
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,730
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

797
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,701
Everything's a nail.

798
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,502
We need to ask the big question.

799
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,339
Ready or not.

800
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,417
Yeah, I know,
but between there and there.

801
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:22,356
Well, it's time to go.

802
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,716
Okay...

803
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,155
Heptapods' purpose.

804
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:05,331
Heptapod purpose Earth.
What is your purpose?

805
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,440
Do we only have Costello?

806
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,854
Okay. There you are.

807
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,801
What does it say?

808
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:55,117
Offer weapon.

809
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,153
You saw what they wrote!

810
01:07:01,284 --> 01:07:02,595
Using a word they don't fully understand.

811
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,189
- Could be a request.
- A warning.

812
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:07,200
Enough! Louise?

813
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,327
We don't know if they understand

814
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:12,030
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

815
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:14,005
Our language, like our culture, is messy,

816
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,871
and sometimes, one can be both.

817
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:17,342
And it's quite possible

818
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,674
that they're asking us
to offer them something,

819
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,179
not the other way around.

820
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:23,375
It's like the first part of a trade.

821
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:25,350
So, how do we clarify their intentions

822
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:26,749
beyond those two words?

823
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:27,844
Well, I go back in.

824
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,854
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

825
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:31,551
It's more complicated than that.

826
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:34,060
How is it more complicated than that?

827
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,528
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense

828
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,189
is on the line for you.

829
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,837
We need to sit on this information

830
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,341
till we know what it means,

831
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,274
so we aren't sharing it with our enemies.

832
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:51,777
We must consider the idea

833
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:53,913
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves

834
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:56,417
until only one faction prevails.

835
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,417
- There's no evidence of that.
- Sure there is.

836
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:00,886
Just grab a history book.

837
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,583
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

838
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,127
They even got a name for it in Hungary.

839
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:16,599
Yeah. We're a world
with no single leader.

840
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,370
It's impossible to
deal with just one of us.

841
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,772
And with the word "weapon" now...

842
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,538
Halpern. Yes, sir!

843
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:45,788
No confirmation yet. Standing by.

844
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,836
Anything? What did they say?

845
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,471
China and Russia are off the grid.

846
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:53,803
They aren't speaking to anyone.

847
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:57,503
Whatever they learned
in their last session has them spooked.

848
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,612
YES, sir!

849
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,478
We have orders to do the same.

850
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:03,744
These are our allies!

851
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,978
You can't shut us down!

852
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,747
- Put us on radio silence.
- Do it.

853
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:10,416
We received a message
from the hept... Damn it!

854
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,955
We need to be talking to each other!

855
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,790
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.

856
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,960
<i>Base-camp talk is now offline.</i>

857
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,368
<i>All interpreters and
international liaisons,</i>

858
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:29,034
<i>stand down and
report to unit coordinators.</i>

859
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,539
We've never
re-entered a session before.

860
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,276
Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

861
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,511
We've just gotta step on it' all right?

862
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:40,554
"Use weapon."

863
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:41,986
<i>This is the alien message</i>

864
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,318
<i>said to have provoked
the Chinese government</i>

865
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:46,120
<i>to withdraw their scientists from</i>

866
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,785
<i>the international mission today.</i>

867
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:50,057
<i>In a statement, General Shang said,</i>

868
01:09:50,153 --> 01:09:52,292
<i>"China no longer trusts the aliens</i>

869
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:53,731
<i>"who want to divide us.</i>

870
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:56,497
<i>"Humanity must be protected."</i>

871
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:59,300
<i>China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.</i>

872
01:10:02,165 --> 01:10:04,076
<i>Alpha one niner,</i>

873
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,669
<i>this is Condor, over.</i>

874
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:13,811
<i>Alpha-one-niner,
this is Condor, come in. Over.</i>

875
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:21,328
<i>Captain Marks, Condor
not receiving transmission.</i>

876
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,597
<i>Squelch Mice if you hear line.</i>

877
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,362
<i>Captain Marks, all escort units</i>

878
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,264
<i>are ordered to cease all activity.</i>

879
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:01,199
No, no, no.
Dr. Banks, you can't go in there.

880
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,201
I just need to ask one question.

881
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,261
Dr. Banks!
The session is finished.

882
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,602
You can't... You can't go
back in. It's dangerous.

883
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:09,575
Look, we just need
five minutes. Don't sweat it.

884
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,374
Marks, let them go.

885
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:16,048
Hey, Abbott!

886
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:24,115
So, what are we calling this'?
Session 37?

887
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,716
Uh, no, 36, part 2.

888
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,626
Why are they on their own?

889
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:38,069
We've been attempting
to hail Captain Marks.

890
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,902
The escort units are not responding, sir.

891
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:43,068
Why not? Send security.

892
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:50,142
"Offer weapon, question mark."

893
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,656
Are you offering us something?

894
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,259
Technology, apparatus, method?

895
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,498
Yeah, see, this is a different word.

896
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:14,336
This... This segment, it's a lot busier.

897
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:23,209
Give technology

898
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,214
How.

899
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,697
What's he doing?

900
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,635
<i>Captain, on your ten.</i>

901
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:54,706
<i>Security detail inbound, sir.</i>

902
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:57,478
<i>T-minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.</i>

903
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,542
<i>Okay, this is it.
Lock and load.</i>

904
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:01,883
<i>We just need to
hold them off until it's done.</i>

905
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:04,481
<i>Copy that.
Warning shots and suppressive fire only.</i>

906
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,860
<i>Load up and get to coven.</i>

907
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:08,088
<i>Stay frosty and we can avoid casualties.</i>

908
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:37,180
Abbott wants me to write on the barrier.

909
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:43,961
Can you even do that?

910
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,962
I don't know.

911
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,715
I can't do it with both hands.

912
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:17,853
Louise...

913
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:34,369
What is that?

914
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:22,516
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

915
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,354
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

916
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,421
How do you feel?

917
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,029
How is Ian?

918
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,269
Same as you. He's okay.

919
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,374
Who, um... Who did this?

920
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,210
Ah, some soldiers.

921
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,546
They've been watching too much TV.

922
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,112
What is that?

923
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:56,622
Take it easy. Take it easy.

924
01:16:58,214 --> 01:17:01,286
The sites no longer secure.
We're standing by to evacuate.

925
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:03,294
Where's Ian?

926
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,298
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

927
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,130
He wouldn't leave until
he knew you were okay.

928
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:13,896
Your whole tent is on the clock

929
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,739
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

930
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:23,982
This is all of it?

931
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,576
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

932
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,023
Not as far as I can see.

933
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,925
You see something?

934
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,494
Oh, I don't know yet.

935
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,427
I'm gonna need my team to get
together with Louise's team.

936
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,090
I need everybody working on this.

937
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,600
We cannot leave.

938
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,100
Glad to see you're awake.

939
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,934
We need to go back in
and explain this wasn't our fault.

940
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,007
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to.

941
01:17:47,096 --> 01:17:49,440
What happened in there was an attack.

942
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,499
We can hope for the best,

943
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,077
but I have orders to
prepare for retaliation.

944
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,512
We may have to evacuate.

945
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:54,642
No, that's the wrong move.

946
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,944
As long as they stay' we have to stay.

947
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,142
Well, they're not leaving.

948
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,986
Why does this feel worse?

949
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,655
<i>China is on the offensive.</i>

950
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,392
<i>They're positioning the military</i>

951
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,199
<i>to blow the alien vessel
right out of the sky.</i>

952
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,725
<i>And if this happens,</i>

953
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,468
<i>we can't sit around
waiting for retaliation.</i>

954
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,062
<i>So, get prepared.</i>

955
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:55,331
<i>The Air Force and infantry
are standing by.</i>

956
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:56,432
YES, sir.

957
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,675
<i>Tonight, China becomes
the first world power</i>

958
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,411
<i>to declare war against the aliens.</i>

959
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:07,077
<i>Following the failure of diplomatic efforts</i>

960
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:08,678
<i>at the United Nations,</i>

961
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,748
<i>China has confirmed that its
language experts have tonight</i>

962
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,521
<i>delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.</i>

963
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,028
<i>In a televised statement,</i>

964
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:19,099
<i>General Shang, chairman of
the People's Liberation Army,</i>

965
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:22,863
<i>said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory</i>

966
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,266
<i>or face destruction.</i>

967
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,533
<i>And he urged ail other world leaders</i>

968
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:29,701
<i>to unite with China
and take a similar stance.</i>

969
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:34,207
<i>With a huge buildup oi forces
at their landing sites,</i>

970
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:37,045
<i>Pakistan, Russia and Sudan
are thought to be</i>

971
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,710
<i>following China 's lead.</i>

972
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:56,392
It can't be random.

973
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:14,013
It's going to take us years.

974
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,994
What's this term here?

975
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,996
Mom...

976
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,136
Mom...

977
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:31,761
Hmm? Sweetie...

978
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,000
Uh, what's this term for that thing,

979
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:36,007
like a... Like a technical term,

980
01:20:36,098 --> 01:20:37,600
where we make a deal,

981
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,668
and we both get something out of it.

982
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,509
A compromise.

983
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,946
No...

984
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,212
Like, it's a competition.

985
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:46,877
Mm-hmm...

986
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,545
But both sides end up happy.

987
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,221
Like a win-win.

988
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,486
More science-y than that.

989
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:56,621
If you want science, call your father.

990
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,309
Thank you.

991
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,752
Sorry.

992
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,155
It's okay.

993
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,092
I'm up.

994
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,556
What time is it?

995
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,900
It's time you opened that
bottle you've been hiding.

996
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,233
You cracked something, didn't you?

997
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:45,573
Yeah. Come here.

998
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:49,039
Take a look at this section.

999
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,846
It seems to be talking about time.

1000
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,513
Their symbol for time is everywhere.

1001
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,078
So what is this?

1002
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:00,687
A formula for faster-than-light travel?

1003
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,854
Who can tell?

1004
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,454
There are too many gaps.

1005
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:06,089
Nothing's complete.

1006
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:07,690
Then it dawned on me.

1007
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,258
Come here.

1008
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,067
Right here.

1009
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,973
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.

1010
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,975
How much of this is data?

1011
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,706
How much of it is negative space?

1012
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,646
So, I measured it.

1013
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,753
0.0833 recurring.

1014
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:35,119
Perhaps you'd like that as a fraction.

1015
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,997
One of twelve.

1016
01:22:42,758 --> 01:22:46,262
What they're saying right here
is that this is one of 12.

1017
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,171
"We are part of a larger whole."

1018
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:50,436
Or we're one of 12 contestants
for the prize.

1019
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:51,910
Why do I have to talk to him?

1020
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,411
We're all working together.

1021
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,779
We need to talk to the other sites,

1022
01:22:55,838 --> 01:22:58,341
help them with what they've
gotten from the heptapods.

1023
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,646
We're blacked out.

1024
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:01,948
China just threatened
to destroy their shell.

1025
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:03,080
We're on our own.

1026
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,956
But this says that all of
the pieces fit together.

1027
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,857
And I'm telling you
that no one else cares.

1028
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:08,487
Two hours ago,

1029
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,655
we pulled this audio off
a secure channel in Russia.

1030
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:13,426
Someone on the science team
there was broadcasting wide.

1031
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,527
<i>In their final session, the aliens said,</i>

1032
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:21,665
<i>"There is no time. Many become one."</i>

1033
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,300
<i>I fear we have all been given weapons.</i>

1034
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:28,041
<i>If anyone is receiving this, please...</i>

1035
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:35,620
Well, I mean,

1036
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:38,155
there are a lot of ways

1037
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,624
you can interpret what he said.

1038
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,721
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

1039
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:43,888
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

1040
01:23:43,986 --> 01:23:45,158
to keep their secret.

1041
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,791
"Many become one"
could just be their way of saying

1042
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,563
"some assembly required."

1043
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:51,399
Why hand it out to us in pieces?

1044
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,200
Why not just give it all over?

1045
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:55,536
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

1046
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,904
Even if I did believe you,

1047
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,708
how in the world are you gonna
get anybody else to play along

1048
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,713
and give up their <i>data?</i>

1049
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:05,080
We offer ours in return.

1050
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:06,652
Yeah?

1051
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,153
A trade?

1052
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,721
It's a non-zero-sum game.

1053
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:15,054
Non-zero-sum game.

1054
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:18,027
That's it. Yeah.

1055
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,929
Thanks.

1056
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:28,102
Nine of the landing sites
have gone

1057
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,436
total comms blackout.

1058
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,533
Only way to reach them
is lo physically drive there

1059
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,012
and yell at the border guards,
which we're doing,

1060
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,377
but it won't be fast enough.

1061
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,849
There must be a way
to get the message to them.

1062
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,853
To our allies, maybe,
but it's too little too late.

1063
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,446
<i>What we need is to get
all the other nations online</i>

1064
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:45,456
<i>before one starts global wan.</i>

1065
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,527
<i>And there's no way for us to reach them.</i>

1066
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,587
Okay, hold on a second. There is!

1067
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,188
It's right above us.

1068
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:55,636
That's problematic
for us right now.

1069
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:58,763
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

1070
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,966
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

1071
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:03,805
Look, they're not our enemy.

1072
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:06,038
They've made no act of
aggression towards us.

1073
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,181
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

1074
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,738
That's not the question.

1075
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:11,409
What is the question?

1076
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:13,749
How do we get you
back in that room

1077
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:15,447
when it's half a mile straight up?

1078
01:25:15,544 --> 01:25:17,285
I think our work here is done.

1079
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,290
It's in the hands of our superiors now.

1080
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:43,009
What the hell is she doing?

1081
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:38,804
Oh, my God! Oh, God, no!

1082
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:01,308
Costello...

1083
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:05,716
Where's Abbott?

1084
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,876
I'm sorry.

1085
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,077
We're sorry.

1086
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:47,057
I need you to...

1087
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:51,426
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

1088
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,007
I don't...

1089
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,075
I don't understand.

1090
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:18,214
What is your purpose here?

1091
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:47,143
How can you know the future?

1092
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,234
I don't...

1093
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:10,768
I don't understand' Who is this child?

1094
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:17,611
The show <i>is</i> called

1095
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:20,185
<i>"Mommy and Daddy talk to Animals."</i>

1096
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:57,054
Wait! No! Wait!

1097
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:47,732
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

1098
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:49,502
Are you all right?

1099
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,446
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1100
01:32:54,536 --> 01:32:55,947
What happened?

1101
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:58,381
I'm trying to figure it out.
This is too big.

1102
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,920
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

1103
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,215
Why?

1104
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:04,348
Russia and Sudan are following China.

1105
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:08,387
I don't understand.

1106
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:09,688
<i>Help me, Mama.</i>

1107
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:13,221
Louise? Whoa!

1108
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,456
Mom!

1109
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:18,794
Mama!

1110
01:33:21,196 --> 01:33:23,198
Sorry, honey.

1111
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:28,375
What day is it? Do you know, baby?

1112
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:30,211
Sunday.

1113
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:38,717
Are you gonna leave me like Daddy did?

1114
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:42,386
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

1115
01:33:42,484 --> 01:33:44,555
You're gonna see him this weekend.

1116
01:33:45,887 --> 01:33:48,731
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

1117
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:58,911
It's my fault.

1118
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:04,076
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

1119
01:34:05,907 --> 01:34:07,580
What?

1120
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:11,320
Well...

1121
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,756
Believe it or not,

1122
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,489
I know something that's going to happen.

1123
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:21,260
I can't explain how I know. I just do.

1124
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:26,100
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

1125
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:30,435
And he said I made the wrong choice.

1126
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:36,040
What? What's going to happen?

1127
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:42,883
It has to do with a really rare disease.

1128
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:48,023
And it's unstoppable.

1129
01:34:49,551 --> 01:34:52,122
Kind of like you are,

1130
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:55,827
with your swimming and your poetry

1131
01:34:55,957 --> 01:34:57,527
and all the other amazing things

1132
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,366
that you share with the world.

1133
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:00,996
I'm unstoppable?

1134
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:03,737
Yeah.

1135
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,657
I got you.

1136
01:35:23,418 --> 01:35:26,490
Louise? Louise?

1137
01:35:28,423 --> 01:35:31,063
I just realized why my husband left me.

1138
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:32,661
My husband left me.

1139
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:34,272
You were married?

1140
01:35:34,362 --> 01:35:36,899
Come on! Let's get out of here.

1141
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:12,710
Mama?

1142
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,211
Yeah?

1143
01:36:14,302 --> 01:36:16,805
Why's my name Hannah?

1144
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:21,650
Get those people back, please.

1145
01:36:21,743 --> 01:36:24,485
Well, your name is very special,

1146
01:36:24,579 --> 01:36:26,752
because it is a palindrome.

1147
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:30,556
It reads the same forward and backward.

1148
01:36:30,752 --> 01:36:33,164
All right, guys,
give me a hand here.

1149
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:35,234
- Yes, sir.
- That goes in the bag.

1150
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,231
Ready to go!

1151
01:37:00,782 --> 01:37:03,786
<i>Evacuation underway.</i>

1152
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:08,195
Hey...

1153
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:12,328
We're done here!
We're taking this with us.

1154
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:38,961
I can read it.

1155
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,667
- I know what it is.
- What?

1156
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,295
It's not a weapon. It's a gift.

1157
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,308
The weapon is their language.

1158
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:51,640
They gave it to us.
Do you know what that means?

1159
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,737
So we can learn Heptapod. If we survive.

1160
01:37:54,836 --> 01:37:57,510
If you learn it, when you really learn it,

1161
01:37:57,638 --> 01:37:59,982
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do,

1162
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:03,079
so you can see what's to come.

1163
01:38:03,177 --> 01:38:05,179
But time, it isn't the same for them.

1164
01:38:05,313 --> 01:38:07,520
It's non-linear.

1165
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:10,185
Look, we did our best,
but it wasn't enough.

1166
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:12,863
The captain will load you up.

1167
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,557
You're lifting off in 5 minutes.

1168
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:18,762
Ian, Louise, it was
an honor to work with you.

1169
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,897
Good luck.

1170
01:38:24,499 --> 01:38:26,342
Hey, Colonel...

1171
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,218
I'm gonna find out where we're going.

1172
01:38:42,717 --> 01:38:44,856
Wake up, Mommy!

1173
01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:22,095
Dr. Banks...

1174
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,964
A pleasure.

1175
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:28,734
General Shang,
the pleasure is mine, really.

1176
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,833
Your president said

1177
01:39:30,932 --> 01:39:34,141
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

1178
01:39:34,235 --> 01:39:35,908
Yeah.

1179
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:39,007
But I confess,
the only reason why I'm here

1180
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:42,747
is to meet you in person.

1181
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:47,183
Me? Well, I'm flattered. Thank you.

1182
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:50,092
18 months ago,

1183
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:52,755
you did something remarkable,

1184
01:39:52,854 --> 01:39:56,859
something not even
my superior has done.

1185
01:39:58,259 --> 01:39:59,863
And what's that?

1186
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:01,632
You changed my mind.

1187
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:07,974
You're the reason for this unification,

1188
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:12,440
all because you reached out to me
at my private number.

1189
01:40:14,442 --> 01:40:16,649
Your private number?

1190
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:19,121
General, I... I don't know
your private number.

1191
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:27,060
Now you know.

1192
01:40:28,556 --> 01:40:31,799
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

1193
01:40:31,893 --> 01:40:36,638
but I believe it was important
for you to see that.

1194
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:40,140
I called you, didn't I'?

1195
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:43,646
Yes, you did.

1196
01:40:54,482 --> 01:40:56,086
Louise!

1197
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:15,041
All right,
let's shut down the system.

1198
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:18,844
Sir'? There's a sat line
here dialing China.

1199
01:41:20,675 --> 01:41:22,677
Here? What do you mean "here"?

1200
01:41:24,845 --> 01:41:27,086
Come on, come on!

1201
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:29,183
Whose phone is it?

1202
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:34,791
It's your phone' sir.

1203
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:43,565
Search base camp now.

1204
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:45,905
Find out who's using that phone.

1205
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:47,706
And hold on to those coordinates.

1206
01:41:47,802 --> 01:41:48,906
YES, sir.

1207
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:51,243
Come on... What do I say?

1208
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:53,877
What do I say?

1209
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,255
Come on.

1210
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:09,959
I will never forget what you said.

1211
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:24,310
You told me my wife's dying words.

1212
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:42,899
We found the source
of the phone call.

1213
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:45,083
It's in the clean room.
We're waiting for instructions.

1214
01:42:48,129 --> 01:42:49,938
What are you doing?

1215
01:42:50,031 --> 01:42:52,102
- What are you doing?
- Changing someone's mind.

1216
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:54,177
- Can you buy me 20 seconds?
- We don't have time for this.

1217
01:42:54,201 --> 01:42:55,612
No, trust me. Buy me 20 seconds.

1218
01:42:55,703 --> 01:42:57,705
- Do you trust me?
- Okay. Yeah.

1219
01:43:00,975 --> 01:43:04,616
Dr. Banks, drop the phone
now or we shoot!

1220
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:09,120
Drop it!

1221
01:43:09,216 --> 01:43:10,320
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

1222
01:43:11,986 --> 01:43:14,830
You are committing
an act of treason!

1223
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,997
- Yes.
- Drop it!

1224
01:43:22,063 --> 01:43:23,701
It's done. I'm done.

1225

are sifting through information</i>

1238
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:09,187
<i>received from the UK, Japan,</i>

1239
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:10,586
<i>Sierra Leone and Venezuela.</i>

1240
01:44:10,678 --> 01:44:12,589
<i>The information they have acquired</i>

1241
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,387
<i>from both of their landing sites...</i>

1242
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:16,621
<i>Also confirming it to be
one of the 12 pieces</i>

1243
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:19,061
<i>of this puzzle that is
being slowly put together.</i>

1244
01:46:08,329 --> 01:46:10,673
<i>So, Hannah,</i>

1245
01:46:12,233 --> 01:46:14,907
<i>this is where your story begins.</i>

1246
01:46:16,904 --> 01:46:19,043
<i>The day they departed.</i>

1247
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:24,580
You all right?

1248
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:32,356
<i>Despite knowing the journey
and where it leads,</i>

1249
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:37,226
<i>I embrace it.</i>

1250
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:42,529
<i>And I welcome every moment of it.</i>

1251
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:46,670
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

1252
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:01,917
H-A-N-N-A-H.

1253
01:47:15,796 --> 01:47:18,402
Now backward. H...

1254
01:47:18,532 --> 01:47:21,103
H-A-N-N-A-H!

1255
01:47:21,201 --> 01:47:22,612
Hannah!

1256
01:47:22,703 --> 01:47:24,705
You ready, baby?

1257
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,943
Hi!

1258
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:33,616
Don't worry. See you.

1259
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:36,717
Daddy!

1260
01:47:45,893 --> 01:47:47,395
You okay?

1261
01:47:51,899 --> 01:47:53,674
Are you ready?

1262
01:47:57,171 --> 01:47:58,912
Oh, guess what? Star stuff!

1263
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:03,921
- Ian'?
- Yeah?

1264
01:48:04,011 --> 01:48:07,652
If you could see your whole life
from start to finish,

1265
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,921
would you change things?

1266
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:21,997
Maybe I'd say
what I feel more often.

1267
01:48:22,096 --> 01:48:23,700
I... I don't know.

1268
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:41,850
You know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

1269
01:48:41,949 --> 01:48:43,519
for as long as I can remember.

1270
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,557
You know what surprised me the most?

1271
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:52,462
It wasn't meeting them.

1272
01:48:57,231 --> 01:48:59,472
It was meeting you.

1273
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:43,286
I forgot how good it
felt to be held by you.

1274
01:49:52,352 --> 01:49:54,354
You wanna make a baby?

1275
01:50:28,589 --> 01:50:31,229
Yes. Yeah.
