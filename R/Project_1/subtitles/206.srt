2
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,434
Mike.

3
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,453
What are you doing?
- Drive, Marcus.

4
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,034
Not so hard.

5
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,888
Four minutes?  Harder.

6
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,220
So I have to go harder and
slower at the same time?

7
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,706
I'm riding Collins.

8
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:38,006
We are approaching 22 Street.

9
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,604
Understood.  We see them.

10
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,265
I have to throw up.

11
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,446
As long as you leave that. That is
hand-stitched leather. Swallow it.

12
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,719
I turn off 6th Street.

13
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:06,079
You had to go to the right.

14
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,509
You are the navigator.
That's why you're sitting there.

15
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:12,412
And where are your glasses?
Put on your glasses.

16
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:15,052
I don't need that.
- You don't see a ball.

17
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,505
Relax.
- A bus.

18
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,889
Sorry, rich whites.

19
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:41,606
We are black, but also agents.
We'll keep ourselves that way.

20
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:06,045
Even the Batmobile is
not running so tightly.

21
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,090
I want to get out of here now,
damn it.

22
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:31,559
Come on.
- You brush that away.

23
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:33,795
No, you are going to
brush that away.

24
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:37,391
Law enforcement. Aside.
- Out of the way.

25
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:45,473
Daddy.

26
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,013
Funny jacket.

27
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,025
You are now pop-pop.

28
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,639
You should see him.

29
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:07,146
You can see it in his eyes.

30
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,224
And his ears.

31
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,424
And by the name,
Marcus Miles Burnett.

32
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,910
That is my name. - His name too.

33
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:18,692
We named it after
you for Reggie's idea.

34
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:23,574
It seemed respectful
to me. I hope you like it.

35
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:25,099
Cool.

36
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,852
But you still have to
marry my daughter.

37
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,854
Uncle Mike.
Do you want to hold the baby?

38
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,691
No, Uncle Mike doesn't
want that.

39
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,210
Hold on.

40
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,637
No, Mike. - Stop it.

41
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:43,466
That's because of the baby.
- Stop the Greeks.

42
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:47,458
You should see the baby.
- I'll wait outside until you get back to normal.

43
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:51,944
Mike.  The baby.

44
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,915
SANTA MARIA IXCOTEL
PRISON MEXICO

45
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,410
Come on, ladies.

46
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:11,506
Prutsers.

47
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:13,320
Hurry up.

48
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:17,723
Aretas.

49
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:21,435
Aretas?

50
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,359
Hurry up.

51
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:27,841
What is this?

52
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:37,918
Stop the ambulance.

53
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,997
Mom.

54
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:21,932
My son.

55
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,953
MEXICO CITY

56
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,845
Don't grieve for his death.

57
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:12,268
Your father's soul is
no longer behind bars.

58
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,674
This is the last thing he
gave us before his death.

59
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:23,907
You are a man now. You are
ready for what needs to happen.

60
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:28,304
Bring honor and respect
back to our family.

61
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:35,083
Your father hid millions of
dollars before he went to jail.

62
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,695
With this you can find it.

63
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,657
We take back what is due.

64
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:59,452
With that money we
can finally take revenge.

65
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:06,858
We will chase the people
who destroyed our family.

66
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,835
He must die last.

67
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,466
Come here, Marcus.

68
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:27,491
We are here to toast
to one of our colleagues.

69
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,665
And I hope your namesake...

70
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:35,162
ever follows in the footsteps
of his old grandfather...

71
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:38,172
to keep our beautiful city safe.

72
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,825
Marcus.

73
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:48,289
May the name Marcus Burnett frighten
all the bastards for years to come.

74
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,249
Thanks everyone.

75
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:58,076
Mike and I have been working with
the police for about 25 years.

76
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,127
And with success.

77
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:02,474
You are all toppers.

78
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:06,012
And I want to thank you.
It was an enormous honor.

79
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,403
PORT OF MIAMI

80
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:22,810
That money is well hidden. If there is
nothing in it, you still have to pay.

81
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:33,126
Hidden treasures in
the ocean. Not wrong.

82
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:37,887
This is more than enough
for the cost of the materials.

83
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:43,170
This is the part that
you can keep.

84
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,195
What do you say?

85
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,179
We had a deal.

86
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,096
I want to renegotiate.

87
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,501
Come here.

88
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:09,702
Look at me.

89
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:13,234
I do not renegotiate.

90
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,417
My family takes
charge of this city again.

91
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:22,493
We need some loyal employees.

92
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,410
Who wants a job?

93
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:28,047
How is your dental insurance?

94
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:33,536
Say that again.

95
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,314
Quiet.

96
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:46,002
Give yourself a pay raise.
Start with that pile there.

97
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:48,394
Okay?

98
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,847
You work for me now.

99
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:02,328
Instruct your people. If you
cooperate, I'll let you live.

100
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:08,532
Grab that money, guys.  Forward.

101
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,362
Mom.

102
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,176
Armando.

103
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,538
It's ours.

104
00:12:18,663 --> 00:12:21,533
That went quickly.
- We have a new base.

105
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,328
You have been there so long
that you sound like a gringo.

106
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,597
I am done.

107
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:35,358
Here we go again.
- I mean it this time.

108
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:38,757
When I looked that baby in
the eye, something changed.

109
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,826
I want to see that kid grow up.

110
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:47,568
Theresa doesn't want you to get
fat at home and destroy things.

111
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,769
We have more time
behind us than before us.

112
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,211
It is time for a change.

113
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:56,048
I'm having a great time now.

114
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:57,995
You paint your beard.

115
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:02,549
You paint your beard. - No.

116
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,288
That is Midnight
Cocoa Bean. I know that.

117
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,862
Cut it off.  Hack.

118
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:13,636
Do you want to be reminded of your cool
shirts and your number of dead criminals?

119
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,715
It's all about family.

120
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:18,487
Hey, Grandpa.
- Rita.

121
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:21,687
No, pop-pop.
That's how he wants to be called.

122
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,360
Do you have photos, pop-pop?
- Of course.

123
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,208
Let me see.
- Look.

124
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,574
Those ears.

125
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,655
My grandson.
- What a sweetheart. He is beautiful.

126
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:38,747
Very much, inspector. I hear
you're going to lead AMMO.

127
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:44,126
Congratulations. What is AMMO?
- Advanced Miami Metro Operations.

128
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,294
A small team that
uses new methods.

129
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:51,484
They are going to replace us oldies.
- Or teach them something new.

130
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,510
I'm really happy for you,
Marcus.

131
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:09,203
Softy.

132
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:11,381
What?
- She's perfect for you.

133
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:15,440
Very smart.
Confident. Ambitious.

134
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,321
She was not the one.

135
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:20,884
What is that? Sad
and dying alone?

136
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,238
You are jealous.

137
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,175
- How long have you been married? 20 years?
- 26.

138
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,946
And when did you last have sex?

139
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,982
That doesn't concern you.
- Exactly.

140
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:33,919
How many great women
do you let go?

141
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:37,681
You do it often, but have
you ever been in love?

142
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,562
Of course.

143
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,871
I've been in love.

144
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:43,455
Once.

145
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,854
Long ago.
- You never told me.

146
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,032
I don't tell you everything.

147
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,883
I keep running after criminals
until I am one hundred.

148
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:58,238
After the hospital you are not allowed
to say anything about 'running'.

149
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:01,603
What do you mean?
What happened there then?

150
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,002
When we ran to
Marcus. I walked you out.

151
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:08,539
You've only seen
my one good butt.

152
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:12,638
So you claim you
ran faster than me?

153
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,192
Indeed.

154
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:15,490
Not really.

155
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,391
I find this a bit sad, though.

156
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:21,795
Don't stretch. That is unfair.

157
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:25,200
Who do you bet on, Cap?
- I'm putting 50 on a broken knee.

158
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:28,274
What do we bet on?

159
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:33,068
If I win, we will
stop. Then we retire.

160
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,051
If I win, you will break those
talks. Then we continue to the hole.

161
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,803
Bad boys for life.

162
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,018
You are not really boys anymore.

163
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:47,712
Get the ambulance ready. He
needs an infusion and oxygen.

164
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,266
No, he.

165
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,770
Ready. Af.

166
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:54,654
You can do this, Marcus.

167
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,068
Come on.
- Where are you?

168
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,832
Come.

169
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:04,141
Keep breathing.

170
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,997
Where are you?

171
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:30,025
Get help.
- Agent shot.

172
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:32,703
Ocean Drive, in the 700 block.

173
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,455
Hold on.

174
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:40,637
Get help.
- Who did this?

175
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,645
Do not die.

176
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:45,298
Come on, Mike.

177
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:46,852
Call an ambulance.

178
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:51,248
I have him on the phone.

179
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:55,975
It'll be fine.

180
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,389
Don't die, man.

181
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,166
I'm here, Mike.

182
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,136
Dear God.

183
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,140
It's me, Marcus.

184
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,793
You have given me many
beautiful things lately.

185
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:38,718
I haven't been to church in
a while. At Easter, I believe.

186
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:43,247
But I'll be honest: I
wasn't there with my head.

187
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,066
I still believe so.

188
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:47,986
Only...

189
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:53,396
I was ashamed of some
of the things we had to do.

190
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:56,536
I know.  'You shall not kill.'

191
00:17:56,768 --> 00:18:00,570
But they were crooks.
All of them.

192
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:04,602
Mike has hardly
had a real life yet.

193
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,082
No wife, no children.

194
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:13,329
Would you please give
him one more chance?

195
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:16,569
He is my very best friend.

196
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,168
My brother.

197
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:22,387
If you save it, I swear...

198
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,387
that I will never use
violence again.

199
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:32,304
A famous officer fights
for his life after a shelling.

200
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,544
Witnesses heard shots and
saw a motorcycle driving away.

201
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,717
Mike Lowrey is in a
critical condition.

202
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:41,006
Tell Cap what we know.

203
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:46,353
Kelly. The ballistics.
- The bullets in Lowrey were SS190s.

204
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,675
From a P90 Herstal. But these were
specially made 5.7x28mm patterns.

205
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,229
Find out who the maker is.

206
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:58,253
We look at 4chan and compare
that with info Yan the FBI.

207
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,378
Mike is like a son to me.

208
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:05,718
Find that bastard.

209
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,940
It's personal to me too.

210
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,754
Let's put everything on it,
okay?

211
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,319
Sure.

212
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:26,969
MEXICO CITY

213
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:30,052
Lowrey should have died last.

214
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:34,822
I'm here. I learned how
to do something like that.

215
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,893
You trained me.

216
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:41,201
That agent was a threat, but not the rest.
- Are you listening to me?

217
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,621
I wanted him to
see the others die.

218
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,469
Finish it.  Do what I say
from now on.

219
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,161
RODRIGO VARGAS COMPLAINER

220
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,746
THE BIGGEST PURCHASER OF MIAMI

221
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:18,985
Retired prosecutor
Rodrigo Vargas was shot.

222
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,030
DR. JACK WEBER FORENSIC EXPERT

223
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,364
The DEA mourns
Jack Weber's death...

224
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,047
a very experienced
forensic expert in Miami.

225
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:40,564
RIGHT LEON SORENSON

226
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,294
There you are.

227
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,773
Another murder has
been committed.

228
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:52,626
Judge Leon Sorenson
was shot on Wednesday.

229
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,862
The war against law enforcement
officers continues.

230
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:13,837
Three more people have been killed
who have a link with our case.

231
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:16,928
War against the rule of law.
- The same shooter as with Mike.

232
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:20,579
What are the links?
- Cameras, witnesses, tire tracks.

233
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,275
Everything points to the
same engine.

234
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,090
A HALF-YEAR LATER

235
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:58,725
Thank you for being here.
It means a lot to the family.

236
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:05,203
You are now married.
You can kiss the bride.

237
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,747
I really have to stop
with greens.

238
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,769
You are top.

239
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:31,675
Ladies and gentlemen,
time for the first toast.

240
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:36,641
I give the floor to agent
Mike Lowrey...

241
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:40,455
who everyone here knows
as Uncle Mike.

242
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:05,508
First: Reggie, I'm very
surprised that you're still here.

243
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:07,881
I remember your first
date with Megan.

244
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:11,861
Marcus and I have
made every effort...

245
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,491
to prevent you from coming back.

246
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:18,174
But believe me,
love is not easy.

247
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,200
Your relationship
will be tested.

248
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:26,691
Your father and I have
endured many storms.

249
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,854
We have a mantra that we tell
each other when things go wrong.

250
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,682
It brings us back
together again.

251
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:39,629
Reggie and Megan, I
want to share it with you.

252
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:43,590
We drive together,
we die together.

253
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:46,142
Bad boys for life.

254
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,205
No.

255
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:05,614
What do you mean no?
- You know that.

256
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:10,131
Even when I heard you were alive, I
knew that this question would come.

257
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:12,912
Look at me, Mike.  No.

258
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:17,101
You don't even know what I'm going to say.
- Yes, I know you.

259
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,818
AMMO is on top of it.

260
00:24:19,982 --> 00:24:24,530
AMMO?
Cap, with all due respect...

261
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:29,309
but AMMO is a high school
musical boy band with weapons.

262
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:33,334
They have nothing yet.
- How do you know that? They have something.

263
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,854
What then?
- They have something.

264
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:40,992
The bullets in your body were custom
patterns from the P90 Herstal.

265
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,839
AMMO will search for the seller.

266
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:45,868
How?

267
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,127
With first-class police work.

268
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:52,113
Sir...

269
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,588
You are really desperate.

270
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:59,221
It does not work. I will not let
you investigate your own case.

271
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,937
Then let me do the Vargas case.

272
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:08,319
I don't want Internal Affairs to
ram a Hubble telescope in my ass.

273
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,592
You know the rules.
- Out with rules.

274
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:15,387
Put me and Marcus on this case.

275
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:19,577
Have you spoken to your partner?

276
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:28,151
Are you retired?
- My daughter is getting married. Is this necessary now?

277
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,176
I told you, right?

278
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:37,413
You have lost our race. You
do not keep your promise.

279
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:42,944
Bad boys for life, right?
- For life, yes. And you're dead.

280
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,103
What are you talking about?

281
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:48,213
Your heart has stopped
three times.

282
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:53,580
Marcus, that bastard took something
from me and I want it back.

283
00:25:53,744 --> 00:25:57,016
What then, Mike?
You are still here.

284
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,518
He just stole the myth.
"Bulletproof Mike."

285
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:05,754
But I've seen you bleed.
You are human just like us.

286
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:07,685
That guy is bleeding too.

287
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:13,543
If you want to take
revenge, people will die.

288
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,605
Count on that.

289
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:21,430
He shot me down.
- And now you are filled with hatred.

290
00:26:22,478 --> 00:26:26,830
You must start thinking about
your karma. This was a sign.

291
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:31,837
A sign to go fast, yes.
Do I let that bag win?

292
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:35,175
'Go fast'?
Are you sometimes 20?

293
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:37,793
You better go slower.

294
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:42,801
You know, Rita called me every
day when you were in the hospital.

295
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:45,484
You have a future together.

296
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:48,954
My future is to grab
that bastard.

297
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:50,655
Not mine.

298
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,415
For the record.

299
00:26:56,612 --> 00:27:02,142
Someone shoots me on the
street and you don't do a shit?

300
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:03,713
You just quit?

301
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,001
How dare you?

302
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:11,078
I sat next to your bed.

303
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,957
I wiped the drool off your chin.

304
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:20,050
You can't do this to me.

305
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,388
I'm asking you.

306
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:32,099
I beg you, man.

307
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,569
I need this.

308
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:38,476
Bad boys.

309
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:41,095
Again.

310
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,187
No, Mike.

311
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:14,400
MEXICO'S DANGEROUS SET

312
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,421
DEATH DRUGSBAAS
WAS HERO IN MEXICO

313
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:25,139
Everything for you, dad.

314
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:36,434
He is not dead.

315
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,759
Did you want that?

316
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:42,459
He can only die if he
has suffered just like us.

317
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,750
Don't kill him until I say so.

318
00:28:44,915 --> 00:28:46,814
He will suffer.

319
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:55,032
AGENT FINALLY RESTORED

320
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,309
A gift for your fans.

321
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,141
A video of a detective who
is being shot went virally fast.

322
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:26,888
The video appeared on the Dark Net
and was soon shown on social media.

323
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:30,949
The authorities think the
shooter posted the video himself.

324
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:35,892
To slow.

325
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:37,489
You go backwards.

326
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,295
I still had the key.

327
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:42,892
What is it?

328
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:47,253
I hear you want to participate.
That is of course not possible.

329
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,316
Who says that?

330
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:52,688
Michael, you were shot.

331
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:54,588
Yes, I always hear that.

332
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:58,517
Why do you think that is?
- Are you my psychologist now?

333
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:04,344
You always say that if you don't want to talk.
- No, if you are going to be a psychologist.

334
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:10,140
This case is exactly what
AMMO was founded for.

335
00:30:10,304 --> 00:30:12,693
You just have to trust me.

336
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:16,426
Come on.  Why do you
always do that?

337
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:19,798
This is not about
whether or not I trust you.

338
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,861
Oh no?

339
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:26,640
Have you already recovered?
- Yes, it's fine.

340
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:28,729
Are you okay?

341
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,225
Are you sure?

342
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,844
You are flying ahead of me now.

343
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,624
If you do this, you make
mistakes that you cannot reverse.

344
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:40,654
Hasta el fuego.

345
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:43,994
What does that mean?
Why would you think that?

346
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,711
Until you burn?  Until you die?

347
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:51,426
You know you
shouldn't ask me to stop.

348
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:54,143
I am asking you precisely
because I know you.

349
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,385
Because I care about you.

350
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:02,191
As a girlfriend.

351
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,682
Let us handle this.

352
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,322
Alexa, volume softer.

353
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,361
Marcus, leave the house.

354
00:32:19,524 --> 00:32:23,702
Sorry honey. How
about a day of wellness?

355
00:32:36,793 --> 00:32:38,283
Is that Manny's car?

356
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:44,828
Where's Manny?
- Behind.

357
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:57,270
Shit, Mike Lowrey.

358
00:32:57,627 --> 00:33:00,250
What are you doing
here? You look like a ghost.

359
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:04,365
They say you're dead. I
have to show you something.

360
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:07,605
On the street they say that
police work is not for you.

361
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,581
Come work for me.

362
00:33:09,777 --> 00:33:12,432
See, there you are shot.

363
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,256
And suddenly you are
trending worldwide.

364
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,471
My hand, man.

365
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:24,065
The police cannot do this. Am I
not being informed of my rights?

366
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:29,929
You should ask me questions and I
will tell you that you can get lost.

367
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,984
My hand.

368
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:40,492
P90 Herstals, custom. Who makes them?
- I'm not in that business anymore.

369
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,242
My mistake.

370
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:45,571
Mike, chill.

371
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,620
Miami is full of vegans...

372
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:51,734
and you have earned that expensive
cart by selling pork chops?

373
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:55,201
I am a hardworking family man.

374
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:09,814
Do you put pork fat on my suit?
- Sorry, Mike.

375
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:12,957
Booker Grassie.

376
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,516
That's his name.
Booker Grassie.

377
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:17,363
That's his name, man.

378
00:34:22,905 --> 00:34:25,399
Mike, the handcuffs.

379
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:33,013
Booker Grassie. The only arms
dealer who adjusts P90 Herstals.

380
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:36,998
What did I say?
- I can't investigate my own case.

381
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:41,275
But that bag has posted a
video of that attack on me.

382
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,515
I can go get it myself
or you let me participate.

383
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:47,042
Or I can shoot you myself.

384
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:49,544
Damn.

385
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:04,424
Suppose I ask you for help and
then you draw your own plan...

386
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:08,788
Know then that I am going
to get a lot of shit over me.

387
00:35:08,913 --> 00:35:12,547
No golden watch, no
beautiful police house.

388
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:15,069
I am hanging on a thin thread.

389
00:35:15,232 --> 00:35:18,471
A very thin thread in a storm.

390
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:21,063
And it's insane.

391
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:24,173
You mean to do it?
- I said that.

392
00:35:24,368 --> 00:35:26,571
And imagine that I am very fat.

393
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:28,710
I can imagine it, Cap.

394
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,658
What is he doing here?
- He's coming to help.

395
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:35,287
I don't want him to work
for me. I don't work for her.

396
00:35:35,515 --> 00:35:38,073
He only gives advice.
You're the boss.

397
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:42,415
You have a past,
don't make it personal.

398
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:46,335
I'm the only professional
here. You do what I say.

399
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:50,677
This is a bad idea.
- Otherwise he'll do it on his own.

400
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,157
This way we can control him.

401
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,757
I'm here, you know.

402
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,280
Mike gives advice.
He observes. No more.

403
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:07,697
What do you have?

404
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:12,014
The maker of those patterns
is going to do another deal.

405
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:15,748
Booker Grassie.
- Did you tell him more?

406
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:18,468
He told me that.

407
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:21,186
So I have not forgotten.

408
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:27,541
I like that.  Teamwork.

409
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:30,555
Already a wonderful
relationship.

410
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,386
Guys, this is Detective
Michael Lowrey.

411
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:39,072
He will advise us.

412
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,398
The police have no suspects yet.

413
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,542
And the shooter is still...

414
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:48,703
Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you for recovering so quickly.

415
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,487
It's a lot better now, thanks.

416
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,485
You look good, Michael.

417
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:58,595
She calls me by my full
name, but you can call me Mike.

418
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,077
Sure, Mike.

419
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:02,101
Great, Michael.

420
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:04,591
Are you one of those?
- There is always one.

421
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,589
Until he is no longer there.

422
00:37:06,786 --> 00:37:09,046
What does that mean?
- It's Mike Lowrey.

423
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:11,470
Do normal once. - We go.

424
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,480
Can we still do
something together?

425
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:22,379
Not with that.
We're going with the Crawdaddy.

426
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,901
Take a look inside.

427
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,653
Need help, grandpa?
- Go do your thing, kid.

428
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:30,339
Do it nice and cool, you know.

429
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:37,316
Everyone is way too serious.

430
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:41,542
Invasions are fun. A kind
of excursion with weapons.

431
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,785
This is not a raid.
We're going to post.

432
00:37:45,507 --> 00:37:49,305
To post? So we're just
going to watch a crime?

433
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,352
We record how the
deal takes place.

434
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,775
And then he will tell us
everything we want to know.

435
00:37:56,972 --> 00:38:01,066
Or: because he is there
and we are there too...

436
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:05,980
we can just pick it up.
- Thank you for your contribution.

437
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,762
Booker Grassie has sold the
bullets that shot at Michael.

438
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:17,445
Can you stop calling me
Michael where everyone is there?

439
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:19,083
That's your name.

440
00:38:24,063 --> 00:38:26,385
Relax and clear your mind.

441
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:30,516
Use God's inspiration to bring
people peace and tranquility...

442
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:33,955
by invading their
soul with your heart.

443
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,946
We are here.

444
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:47,681
Excuse me,
Mr. Lowrey. Can I pass?

445
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,409
Of course.

446
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:53,610
You're the technician,
aren't you?

447
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:58,065
Are they leaving you in the van?

448
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:01,701
Yes, I feel more
comfortable here.

449
00:39:02,914 --> 00:39:05,403
I'm sending Big Barry.
- Isn't that you?

450
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,150
That's our drone.

451
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,865
So you send the drone on it.

452
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,999
Just fly.

453
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:23,783
Barry is the only one who
can do something fun.

454
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:28,525
Black pickup.
Those are our H-77 Boyz.

455
00:39:28,722 --> 00:39:30,122
Who are they?

456
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,165
Give me a wide-angle image.

457
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,298
Zoom in.

458
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:54,133
Booker sells them
a 5.7x28mm crate.

459
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:57,795
That is Booker Grassie.
- It is going to happen.

460
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,013
Audio.

461
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:00,538
This is it.

462
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,088
These shoot right through
everything and everyone.

463
00:40:05,213 --> 00:40:06,405
I offer a guarantee...

464
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,589
He's there.  We can catch him.

465
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,925
No, that's too risky.

466
00:40:12,188 --> 00:40:13,588
Out of it. - We are waiting.

467
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,242
You're the boss. - I know.

468
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:19,284
I just said that.
- And I confirm.

469
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:20,952
You had something, didn't you?

470
00:40:21,149 --> 00:40:22,587
Not really.
- Something like that.

471
00:40:22,785 --> 00:40:25,334
I want to see the money.

472
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:28,114
The money.
- Wait.

473
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:30,993
Something back.  The guy.

474
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:33,609
That bag is empty.

475
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,880
There is no money in it.
It's a rip deal.

476
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:40,607
They are going to kill
him. We need Booker alive.

477
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,238
Come with him, Kelly.

478
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:53,755
Show the bodycams.

479
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:10,369
Michael, do nothing until
the rest are in position.

480
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:20,704
Can we start counting the money?
- Beautiful number.

481
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,124
Put it harder.

482
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,730
Now.

483
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:34,258
Put it down.

484
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,411
Do you hear me?

485
00:42:36,548 --> 00:42:39,687
Give me cover fire. We
are coming your way.

486
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:43,971
If you want to stay
alive, stay with me.

487
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:46,392
If you sew me, I'll shoot you.

488
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:48,479
I count to three.

489
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:51,461
Get the car.  Get the things.

490
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:53,718
One two...

491
00:42:54,602 --> 00:42:56,002
three.

492
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:39,211
Look at me.  Do not die.

493
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,546
P90 Herstals.  Who bought it?

494
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,727
Call an ambulance.

495
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,324
Just let them come.

496
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:02,301
Calm. - Do what I say once.

497
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,898
He is dead.

498
00:44:08,777 --> 00:44:14,434
Is that Diego or his twin brother?
- His twin brother. Don't, Carmelita.

499
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:23,591
Yes?
- With Carver Remy.

500
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:28,072
I'm just busy. Don't waste
my time. Leave me alone.

501
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:29,903
It is important.

502
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:32,470
Keep an eye on my baby.

503
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:36,747
I am retired. I only talk to
the rats in my basement.

504
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,171
Carmelita shot the wrong guy.

505
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:43,560
The guy who shot
Mike wants to kill me.

506
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:49,056
I am followed by that guy on a black
motorcycle who was on the news.

507
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:53,729
Would I lie to you? Yes, that's
why you are no longer an informer.

508
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:58,336
What do you want from me?
- Put me in insured custody.

509
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,838
Or use me as bait.
Do something.

510
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:03,503
The guy is after me.

511
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:05,905
Have you spoken to Mike?
- I called you.

512
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:09,098
19th and Miami. Third
floor. I'm waiting for you.

513
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:22,327
What did I say? What did I say?

514
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,223
That you had to give advice,
advise.

515
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,955
You must see this battlefield.

516
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:32,661
They did that to each other.
- Did you shoot anyone?

517
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:37,070
Yes of course. But
they had already started.

518
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:40,362
You promised. - No.

519
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,549
I said I could imagine you as a fat
guy on a thin thread. With sharks.

520
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:48,984
You would watch.
- And I saw things.

521
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:53,427
Cap, look.
That bag is empty.  No money.

522
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,179
He scratched his nose and then I
saw that there was nothing in it.

523
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,305
Very impressive.
- I like her.

524
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,971
Without me,
Grassie would have been dead.

525
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:07,710
Fortunately then, because he is lying
in a body bag and looks pretty dead.

526
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:11,264
Good job, Mikey.
- Jochie, seriously.

527
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:14,786
Children must know their place.

528
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:17,228
I don't care about your opinion,
Grandpa.

529
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:20,709
That I fucked your mother
doesn't make me your grandfather.

530
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,428
Stop that.
- Nice and cool.

531
00:46:24,593 --> 00:46:28,706
Stop it.
- I completely beat you up.

532
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:32,557
Then hit.
- Are you toddlers? Come with me.

533
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:34,926
I have time today.

534
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,703
Quiet. Walk on.

535
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:39,599
Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

536
00:46:40,983 --> 00:46:43,417
Do you want...
- Go ahead.

537
00:46:57,964 --> 00:46:59,364
What?

538
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,577
What a sad thing.

539
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:09,087
Where's your car?
- The girls went to the spa with them.

540
00:47:17,545 --> 00:47:18,901
Are you okay?

541
00:47:19,026 --> 00:47:21,099
Yes fine. With you?

542
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,172
Better than ever.

543
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,404
You would,
if you really wanted to...

544
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:31,268
can drive the maximum speed.

545
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:33,735
We have been overtaken
by a Prius.

546
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:38,738
And what is that? Are your
balls in there sometimes?

547
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:43,674
None of my balls
needs your company.

548
00:47:49,928 --> 00:47:52,954
Do you take little Marcus
on a murder investigation?

549
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,995
We drop it off at the spa.

550
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:57,102
Drop off at the spa?

551
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,795
Carver is scared. He won't wait.
- It's that way.

552
00:48:02,027 --> 00:48:06,126
What does that guy who shot me with
a tell-tale like Carver Remy do?

553
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:08,936
We're going to figure
that out, jerk.

554
00:48:10,194 --> 00:48:14,457
Sorry, little Marcus. Pop-pop
cannot swear like that.

555
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:19,515
But with bastards like Mike
Lowrey you have no choice.

556
00:48:19,914 --> 00:48:22,095
Sorry, I'll do it again.

557
00:48:31,022 --> 00:48:33,336
Take the baby inside.
- Look at it.

558
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,047
Then you will never know
who wanted to kill you.

559
00:48:36,212 --> 00:48:39,584
When I go inside, Theresa
Burnett is going to kill me.

560
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:41,998
Grab your baby and go inside.

561
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:46,196
Mike, Carver is scared.
He doesn't wait all day.

562
00:49:06,562 --> 00:49:08,479
I finish Marcus completely.

563
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:10,892
To drive.
- What has she done?

564
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:14,926
What have you done? Is
she coming? She's coming.

565
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:19,653
You've known Theresa for a
long time. How angry was she?

566
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:22,562
On a scale of 1 to 10?
- 10 is then...

567
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:25,770
When I broke up with your sister?
- I was then at 10.

568
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:28,911
Why do you start about that?

569
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,563
A Theresa-10 is...

570
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:35,821
When you knocked over your coffee in my Ferrari.
- Yes, exactly.

571
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:39,259
Then she is on a 9.

572
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,416
Make it a 10.

573
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:48,185
I have forgotten the wipes.
- Horrible.

574
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:54,533
Are you stopping now?

575
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:56,946
The light was orange.

576
00:49:57,113 --> 00:49:58,633
We are in a hurry.

577
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:04,814
Are you afraid they'll see
you like that?

578
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:09,178
Mike Lowrey is here.

579
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:12,650
Mike Lowrey in a Nissan Quest.

580
00:50:14,966 --> 00:50:19,064
Nobody cares, Mike.
- He's my Uber driver.

581
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:24,618
You must always be one
step ahead of criminals.

582
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:29,478
You don't have to stop for
pigeons. They do fly away.

583
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:39,397
I just hope that's
a safe or a piano.

584
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:45,546
That car belongs to my wife.
- And that's Carver Remy.

585
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,356
You do not know.
It can be anyone.

586
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,555
Cover the front door.
- I am retired. I'm a citizen.

587
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,407
This is a sign.
A sign from God.

588
00:51:06,904 --> 00:51:10,143
She knows it.  She always knows.

589
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,242
A 3-15 at the Broadmoor Hotel.

590
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:34,939
God, I've asked you more
than once to help Mike...

591
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:39,104
but he really gets a beating.

592
00:51:41,353 --> 00:51:42,774
Lord, give me a sign.

593
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,233
What are you doing?

594
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:57,293
Better than it goes with you
when Theresa sees this car.

595
00:53:06,881 --> 00:53:08,281
I had him.

596
00:53:08,865 --> 00:53:11,211
I could have caught him.

597
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:14,451
I don't understand, mama.
- Armando.

598
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:20,105
With a bullet, the bag your father
took from me gets away too easily.

599
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:22,783
He must suffer.

600
00:53:23,015 --> 00:53:26,188
And only then should he die.

601
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:28,535
Do you hear me?
- Yes.

602
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,968
Pass the ball.  Very well.

603
00:54:01,465 --> 00:54:03,999
Very good, Callie. Make
sure they prefer to play soccer.

604
00:54:05,168 --> 00:54:07,777
You got rid of that case.
- I know.

605
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:13,360
If she makes a violation,
you make one back.

606
00:54:14,716 --> 00:54:17,721
There is a Buddhist.

607
00:54:17,986 --> 00:54:23,172
He lives high in the mountains
and walks down a winding road.

608
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:29,680
And from nowhere a man
comes up to him on a horse.

609
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:33,909
Also a Buddhist, I
think. I'm not sure.

610
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:37,543
Let's say they are
both Buddhists.

611
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:42,928
The guy on that horse
runs so fast for him...

612
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:46,925
that he must dive to the side
in order not to be trampled.

613
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:49,105
He stands up and says:

614
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:52,178
'Where are you going?'

615
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:56,440
And that guy on the horse says:

616
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,759
'I do not know. You have
to ask the horse that. "

617
00:55:03,114 --> 00:55:05,590
"Ask the horse?"  Cool.

618
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:11,272
That's what I meant.

619
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,742
I looked that way too.

620
00:55:17,056 --> 00:55:23,464
The horse represents
all our fears and traumas.

621
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:27,329
That's why we just
keep on going...

622
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:32,285
so that we can no longer
even answer a simple question.

623
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,366
'Where are you going?'

624
00:55:37,076 --> 00:55:39,023
Where are you going, Mike?

625
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:46,689
No, Callie.  Do not fit.  Shoot.

626
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:57,888
Missing is in the family.

627
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:02,579
You have to take control
of your life.

628
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:08,393
Grab the reins before your
horse crashes into a ravine.

629
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:20,465
Come eat with us.

630
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:24,813
Callie will like that. And
I tell a Buddhist story.

631
00:56:24,978 --> 00:56:27,918
Are you going to cook again?
- Really.

632
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:31,123
I do order pizza.
- That seems fine.

633
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:39,197
Bingo.

634
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:47,324
Shoot him.

635
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:53,654
I can help.  What should I do?

636
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:57,057
Shoot.
- Shut up.

637
00:56:59,403 --> 00:57:01,582
Through her.
- Out of the way.

638
00:57:01,947 --> 00:57:03,630
I can help.
- Behind that car.

639
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:10,997
What is wrong with you?
You could shoot.

640
00:57:11,196 --> 00:57:13,244
No innocent people.

641
00:57:13,443 --> 00:57:15,292
You are insane.

642
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:20,063
Shots have been fired.
Agent down.

643
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:21,834
The José Marti park.

644
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:26,822
Send a heli. This is
Detective Mike Lowrey.

645
00:57:27,021 --> 00:57:33,132
The Chief Inspector was shot.

646
00:57:55,135 --> 00:57:56,535
Ready.

647
00:57:56,754 --> 00:57:58,735
To target.  Fire.

648
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:35,882
You were right.

649
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,145
You said there would
be deaths if I got involved.

650
00:59:26,779 --> 00:59:28,198
Just one last time?

651
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,385
Just one last time.

652
01:00:03,596 --> 01:00:06,171
They are all dead.
Is it time now?

653
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,355
Kill him.

654
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,716
But first look him in the eye and
say something to him on my behalf.

655
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,241
What, mama?

656
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:22,778
All Booker cover companies
have the same accountant.

657
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:25,387
Picante Jenkins, CPA.

658
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:28,524
You don't hear that name often.

659
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:39,486
So we're just going to chat?

660
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:44,042
What is that all about?

661
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:48,466
What do you mean?
- You don't need a grenade launcher.

662
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,283
But I want one.

663
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:52,462
He is an accountant.

664
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,962
We're not going in there like that.
- How not?

665
01:00:56,193 --> 01:01:00,815
We have been bad boys all our
lives. Now we have to be good men.

666
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,536
Doesn't that sound like a meter?

667
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:09,730
Good men,
what are you going to do?

668
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:15,541
If you sing it as if you
mean it, it is quite successful.

669
01:01:17,952 --> 01:01:19,371
Call and talk.

670
01:01:19,669 --> 01:01:21,069
Yes. Knock Knock.

671
01:01:24,258 --> 01:01:26,041
Law enforcement.  To the ground.

672
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:29,243
What is this?
- We would knock and talk.

673
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:31,125
You destroyed my door.

674
01:01:31,357 --> 01:01:35,912
Sorry about the door. With
some super glue it will be fine.

675
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:37,266
Where's your order?

676
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:40,766
On your knees, with your
hands behind your head.

677
01:01:43,738 --> 01:01:46,577
If you don't stop, I'll
shoot you in the head.

678
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,460
No.
- Yes.

679
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:52,091
He is an accountant.
We just want to talk to him.

680
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,261
So you want to
talk to a sniffed...

681
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:58,266
These are the latest figures.

682
01:01:58,398 --> 01:02:00,841
Leave this to me.

683
01:02:01,007 --> 01:02:04,638
I'm going to penetrate
his soul with my heart.

684
01:02:07,214 --> 01:02:08,633
Just pay attention.

685
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:13,816
Hey, ass lick. I'm
going to fist you hard.

686
01:02:13,983 --> 01:02:16,194
That is unpleasant.

687
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,826
I realize that this is
a difficult situation.

688
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:22,005
Stay away from me.
- Stay away from him.

689
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:25,703
We only want your
client's receipts.

690
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:27,816
Booker Grassie.  Everything...

691
01:02:33,926 --> 01:02:35,840
How deep did you
get in his soul?

692
01:02:37,062 --> 01:02:39,802
Sometimes you have to
suffer for the good cause.

693
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:43,155
Don't turn the other cheek.
- Get off me.

694
01:02:45,426 --> 01:02:48,491
I know you're scared.

695
01:02:48,648 --> 01:02:52,030
We are all scared.
Sometimes fear is...

696
01:03:31,268 --> 01:03:32,841
What do you think?

697
01:03:36,122 --> 01:03:38,285
That you should do this.

698
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,991
Seems better to me too.

699
01:03:42,582 --> 01:03:46,845
MLK is doing it. Brother Malcolm
takes over, say whatever you want.

700
01:03:47,009 --> 01:03:51,435
You are the agent who was shot.
It doesn't bother you, does it?

701
01:03:51,633 --> 01:03:55,272
If you didn't have that
gun, I would beat you rotten.

702
01:03:55,437 --> 01:03:59,043
So this is the only thing that
keeps you from doing that?

703
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:03,133
Bring it on.

704
01:04:08,915 --> 01:04:11,865
Links safe.
- Cuff him.

705
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:14,325
What are you doing here?

706
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,998
I called them.

707
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:20,556
We would be bad boys
one more time, right?

708
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,688
This is the last time. But
this is the remix, Mike.

709
01:04:24,918 --> 01:04:27,049
We now work together with AMMO.

710
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:32,066
Cut it off.

711
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:34,755
You have three seconds
before I bite it off.

712
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:38,199
Fuck that finger.

713
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:43,186
Okay. Judge, prosecutor,
informant, chief inspector and you.

714
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:46,794
What do you have in common?
- Hundreds of things.

715
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:49,910
847 overlapping cases
between the victims.

716
01:04:50,074 --> 01:04:52,008
Who wants to kill you?

717
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,009
Who not? And those
are just the criminals.

718
01:04:56,174 --> 01:04:59,812
I don't trust anyone who doesn't
want to kill him. Put me there.

719
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:01,715
And thanks, Marcus.

720
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:05,256
And that accountant?
- His administration is a mess.

721
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:08,044
But I'm in his Keychain.

722
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,307
And thus? - All his socials.

723
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:16,439
Many dickpics, few clues.

724
01:05:16,636 --> 01:05:19,029
Do a face recognition.
- Okay.

725
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,259
Three days before I was shot.

726
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,982
Go back to that necklace.

727
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:27,908
Zoom in.

728
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:31,470
Zway-Lo.

729
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,349
Who is Zway-Lo?
- Lorenzo Rodriguez.

730
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:39,629
His nickname is Zway-Lo. I used to be his
basketball coach before he became a criminal.

731
01:05:39,826 --> 01:05:42,252
Sat on the couch at the
competition for the title.

732
01:05:42,515 --> 01:05:46,876
Are you putting a ten-year-old kid on the couch?
- He called me a jerk.

733
01:05:47,139 --> 01:05:50,418
Did you win?
- No, he was our best man.

734
01:05:50,648 --> 01:05:55,402
We lost 40 points difference.
But there is no 'me' in 'team'.

735
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,862
In 'jerk' though.
- Shut up.

736
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:03,082
Zway-Lo deals in drugs and weapons.
He is one of Taglin's lieutenants.

737
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,837
Taglin was murdered
the night Mike was shot.

738
01:06:06,035 --> 01:06:08,296
He's someone else's
lieutenant now.

739
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,953
Lorenzo Rodriguez. No
mortgage, no bank account.

740
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,150
But it's his birthday tomorrow.

741
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:21,578
There are three places where someone like
him would celebrate: Ditto, Ice 45, Zillion.

742
01:06:21,776 --> 01:06:23,185
Can you access their files?

743
01:06:23,865 --> 01:06:26,152
Ice 45 does not have its
internet security in order.

744
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,610
OK, Ice 45.

745
01:06:28,741 --> 01:06:30,143
Ditto.

746
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,840
Zillion.

747
01:06:32,997 --> 01:06:35,128
Over there.  Rodriguez.

748
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:39,035
The party is tonight.
- In Zillion.

749
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:45,299
We meet in the club at
eleven. Put on nice clothes.

750
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:51,235
We only hold him. In and out.
There must be absolutely no deaths.

751
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,455
No deaths. Has anyone
informed the bad guys?

752
01:06:55,686 --> 01:07:00,756
Use rubber balls. You can
shoot as many as you want.

753
01:07:01,345 --> 01:07:04,682
Bad boys, bad boys,
what are you going to do?

754
01:07:04,879 --> 01:07:07,789
if they come after you?

755
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:12,534
No not at all. You will
never do that again.

756
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:16,296
And the text is incorrect. It
takes a long time to learn.

757
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:19,404
So don't.  I really don't.

758
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:23,559
Find your own number.

759
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,189
Unbelieveable.

760
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:05,666
Softy.

761
01:08:05,796 --> 01:08:08,739
Keep your opinion nice for you.

762
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:11,226
Just leave me.

763
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:13,876
Hello ladies.
Is Georgio there too?

764
01:08:14,205 --> 01:08:16,657
I don't know who that is.
- The line starts there.

765
01:08:18,588 --> 01:08:19,988
Nicole, Paige.

766
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:22,154
Rafe.

767
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:26,734
You look so good. So beautiful.
- You too.

768
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:30,332
That's my uncle Michael
and his friend uncle Marcus.

769
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,964
Can they come in?
He just got divorced.

770
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:36,547
How sad.

771
01:08:36,672 --> 01:08:37,962
Come on in.

772
01:08:38,087 --> 01:08:41,128
Come on.  Mind your step.

773
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:45,447
It really is like that.
- No.

774
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,548
Where is our target?

775
01:08:59,778 --> 01:09:03,442
Second floor. The
VIP section. I see him.

776
01:09:14,893 --> 01:09:16,293
Hey, baby.

777
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,566
Target confirmed.

778
01:09:27,881 --> 01:09:32,166
You can only get in or
out one way. He's trapped.

779
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:36,353
The man on the right has a weapon.
- Follow our plan.

780
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:39,298
Kelly, you take his bodyguard.

781
01:09:49,605 --> 01:09:54,707
Mike, how can she turn like that?
She must have strong buttock muscles.

782
01:09:56,704 --> 01:10:01,644
I'm going to be honest with you.
I haven't had sex in a long time.

783
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:06,257
Too long.  I have really
weird fantasies, Mike.

784
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:08,939
Marcus.
- I feel trapped since...

785
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:14,533
You know they can hear you, don't you?
- It's too loud. They don't hear us.

786
01:10:14,764 --> 01:10:21,175
Sometimes I see really crazy things
on the internet. Like a man who...

787
01:10:24,579 --> 01:10:25,979
We can hear you.

788
01:10:28,668 --> 01:10:32,953
That was just a joke. You
haven't heard anything, have you?

789
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,159
In position.
- We're going to start.

790
01:10:36,454 --> 01:10:38,776
Mike, Marcus,
I see you upstairs.

791
01:10:39,889 --> 01:10:41,917
Mike and Marcus
on the right stairs.

792
01:10:43,193 --> 01:10:45,091
Rita on the left staircase.

793
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,409
Everyone in position?

794
01:10:49,606 --> 01:10:51,666
Ready.
- Ready.

795
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:55,560
Great dress.
You really have style.

796
01:10:55,822 --> 01:10:57,621
Thanks.

797
01:10:57,851 --> 01:10:59,845
Stand-by.

798
01:11:00,042 --> 01:11:02,528
Not going.
I'm with my girlfriends.

799
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:06,388
They may also come along.
- I can't go tonight.

800
01:11:06,619 --> 01:11:09,104
A knee in his balls and gone.

801
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:11,166
From Tétouan.

802
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:13,326
Bye, baby.

803
01:11:13,523 --> 01:11:15,781
That is not an undercover dress.

804
01:11:16,044 --> 01:11:19,773
You should have put on
something more undercover.

805
01:11:19,972 --> 01:11:21,372
Happy Birthday.

806
01:11:21,575 --> 01:11:25,240
OK people.  Let you hear.

807
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:31,000
We have a special guest. It's
his birthday. Congratulate him.

808
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:34,109
Three two one. - Happy Birthday.

809
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:36,296
We love you, Zway-Lo.

810
01:11:40,656 --> 01:11:42,456
Really cool.

811
01:11:42,718 --> 01:11:44,190
Warmly, jerk.

812
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:18,294
You go in jail, asshole.

813
01:12:18,524 --> 01:12:21,076
I say "crook", you say "cell."

814
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,003
Law enforcement.  No movement.

815
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:35,116
I already said he was sporty.

816
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:36,950
To jump. - Look at it.

817
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,881
He escapes.  To jump.

818
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:44,274
Zway-Lo.

819
01:12:46,933 --> 01:12:48,333
Out of the way.

820
01:12:50,107 --> 01:12:51,547
I need this.

821
01:12:51,745 --> 01:12:53,314
Sorry. - What are you doing?

822
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:55,343
Do not. - Police matters.

823
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:58,093
This is my car.
- Out of the way.

824
01:13:00,254 --> 01:13:04,508
What good is it to jump
if you just take the stairs?

825
01:13:04,705 --> 01:13:06,700
I said I didn't want to jump.

826
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,941
Zway-Lo turns left
on 2nd Avenue.

827
01:13:15,048 --> 01:13:18,025
Are you wearing your seat belt? Is it now like this?
- Really.

828
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:21,200
Number 1 is after me.

829
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,328
I enter Overtown.

830
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:27,942
That's left soup. Zway
has dangerous guys there.

831
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:30,429
We are dangerous guys.

832
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:38,939
Stupid Nerf-gun with its rubber bullets.
They shoot bullets, we make rubber bears.

833
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:42,572
Mike, stop for a moment. I
have to tell you something.

834
01:13:42,769 --> 01:13:46,401
Should I stop? Let's
see if Zway cooperates.

835
01:13:46,566 --> 01:13:49,871
Zway-Lo, Marcus wants to stop.

836
01:13:50,036 --> 01:13:53,700
Can we take a time out?
- I have to tell you something.

837
01:13:53,897 --> 01:13:55,696
What?
- I promised God something.

838
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:57,327
Who?
- God.

839
01:13:58,217 --> 01:13:59,820
What the hell are you?

840
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:05,515
I promised God that I would renounce
violence if you continued to live.

841
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:09,312
He knows that's bullshit.
Violence is our thing.

842
01:14:12,945 --> 01:14:14,385
It's about your soul.

843
01:14:14,615 --> 01:14:17,102
We must protect and serve.

844
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:20,375
I'll do that jerk a favor.

845
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,947
Do you have to see that?

846
01:14:40,144 --> 01:14:42,990
That guest is just like the
Elephant Man.

847
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:46,428
Do you see that? - Yes I see it.

848
01:14:46,657 --> 01:14:50,387
It calls me.  I can not help it.

849
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:53,955
Stop. What is wrong with
you? Stay away from it.

850
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:57,261
Do not touch.
He'll soon be fine.

851
01:14:57,458 --> 01:15:00,075
That's gross.
- Do not touch that.

852
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:07,603
Do not touch that.
- Again.

853
01:15:07,768 --> 01:15:09,172
Overtown wakes up.

854
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,408
AMMO, where are you?
- We are now entering Overtown.

855
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:13,972
Pack your bags.

856
01:15:19,957 --> 01:15:21,357
Come.

857
01:15:33,421 --> 01:15:34,989
We have your husband.

858
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,600
I shoot him.

859
01:15:39,762 --> 01:15:42,637
Wake up, Zway-Lo.
- Waking.

860
01:15:43,179 --> 01:15:44,466
Wake up now.

861
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:46,096
Coach Burnett?

862
01:15:47,506 --> 01:15:49,238
Jerk.

863
01:15:50,742 --> 01:15:52,473
Do you still find me a jerk?

864
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,916
Who wants to kill me?
- Everyone.

865
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,363
I already said that.

866
01:15:58,488 --> 01:16:00,284
Forget about me.  Kill them.

867
01:16:00,546 --> 01:16:03,552
What is he saying?
- Finish them both.

868
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:08,944
You both go for it.
- They are coming.

869
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:14,696
Thank God.

870
01:16:18,488 --> 01:16:20,611
Why are you letting him escape?

871
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:23,711
Cover fire.

872
01:16:41,592 --> 01:16:43,585
Get in.
- There is a pit bull.

873
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:47,703
Hurry up. Do you want
to be bitten or shot?

874
01:16:49,207 --> 01:16:50,644
Hurry up.

875
01:17:02,214 --> 01:17:03,717
Shit.
- What is there?

876
01:17:03,913 --> 01:17:06,756
It is just like the basement
of an angry white man.

877
01:17:09,567 --> 01:17:11,429
A hand grenade.

878
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:14,370
Pull out the pin.
- This is not Vietnam.

879
01:17:15,482 --> 01:17:17,442
Then hold him.
- Jerk.

880
01:17:39,731 --> 01:17:41,396
What else do you have?

881
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:47,475
Shoot that thing.

882
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:50,972
No, I have promised
God to stop using violence.

883
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:58,750
Who do you think gave
you that weapon?

884
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,380
That is God's weapon.

885
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:02,506
Yes?
- Because you are in need.

886
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:03,985
That's true.

887
01:18:04,110 --> 01:18:07,214
Yes, you do God's work.

888
01:18:07,444 --> 01:18:10,155
Just like David and Goliath.
- With his pendulum.

889
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:12,998
Yes, that's your pendulum.

890
01:18:13,195 --> 01:18:15,123
To kill enemies.

891
01:18:15,352 --> 01:18:18,129
You know, bad boys of the Bible.

892
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:21,756
Exactly. Amen.
- Amen.

893
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:28,032
Where's your glasses?
- I don't need glasses.

894
01:18:28,195 --> 01:18:29,595
You don't touch anything.

895
01:18:41,693 --> 01:18:43,093
Come.

896
01:18:57,052 --> 01:18:59,829
Get that quad.
I take it behind me.

897
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:26,333
Mike.
What the hell are you doing?

898
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,189
I don't want to die like that.

899
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,973
My mistake.
- Really.

900
01:20:55,747 --> 01:20:59,112
Out of the way.
Get out the way.

901
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:14,467
Hasta el fuego.

902
01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:14,575
Dorn, I need you.

903
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,567
I have experienced this before.

904
01:22:19,765 --> 01:22:22,194
Very often.  It will be fine.

905
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:25,149
Zway-Lo's telephone.
Can you get in there?

906
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:31,487
Yes, what am I looking for?
- His contacts.

907
01:22:33,393 --> 01:22:36,118
And it has to be a bit fast.

908
01:22:38,154 --> 01:22:41,011
Then I have to do
some illegal things.

909
01:22:41,242 --> 01:22:43,079
Do you think that's okay?

910
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:46,889
Yes.
- Get started then.

911
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:53,884
Dorn is a big guy. How did
he become so good at this?

912
01:22:54,082 --> 01:22:56,183
In which? - Technical things.

913
01:22:56,381 --> 01:22:59,926
He looks like a killer.
- That's right. He was a bouncer.

914
01:23:00,059 --> 01:23:02,193
Someone was harassing a woman...

915
01:23:02,456 --> 01:23:06,002
He slapped the guy
and he fell down dead.

916
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:08,005
Since then he has
avoided violence.

917
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:11,486
Got you.

918
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,197
The last two months.

919
01:23:17,299 --> 01:23:18,699
Mexico.

920
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:21,195
What are you looking for?

921
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:27,939
Send the message 'Hasta
el fuego' to all those numbers.

922
01:23:31,487 --> 01:23:35,262
Happened.
- Let me go now.

923
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,265
Sure? - Yes, go.

924
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:46,416
PRISON DATABASE

925
01:24:08,858 --> 01:24:11,648
BABY BORN IN
PRISON MARCH 20, 1996

926
01:24:40,482 --> 01:24:42,025
We have to stop.

927
01:24:42,256 --> 01:24:44,586
What do you mean?
- AMMO is canceled.

928
01:24:46,513 --> 01:24:47,913
Sorry.

929
01:24:48,134 --> 01:24:51,647
Everything will be fine.
 Trust me.

930
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:53,421
Everything will be fine.

931
01:25:14,603 --> 01:25:16,003
Are you okay?

932
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:20,152
I think he's my son.

933
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:36,046
24 years ago, before
we became partners...

934
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:42,384
Howard took me straight from the
course. Nobody knew who I was.

935
01:25:42,549 --> 01:25:46,621
He let me go undercover
at the Aretas cartel.

936
01:25:48,198 --> 01:25:51,776
Sorenson. Weber.
Vargas. Carver.

937
01:25:51,941 --> 01:25:56,112
All the victims were in
that case. This is revenge.

938
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:58,180
You weren't in that case.

939
01:25:58,378 --> 01:26:02,384
Not in name.
It was that secret.

940
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,470
I was Ricky Rollins.

941
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,904
Benito Aretas. He is
dead. He's not after you.

942
01:26:10,069 --> 01:26:12,728
Not him, but his wife.

943
01:26:14,371 --> 01:26:15,771
Isabel.

944
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:21,988
I was her driver. We
had a very intense bond.

945
01:26:22,154 --> 01:26:26,390
We talked about everything and she
explained how everything worked.

946
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:30,461
How I should
behave. How to dress.

947
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:33,614
She made Mike Lowrey.

948
01:26:36,143 --> 01:26:37,785
We fell in love.

949
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:39,854
So the only time you...

950
01:26:40,051 --> 01:26:43,301
Isabel Aretas.  The only time.

951
01:26:43,926 --> 01:26:48,030
We would take action.
DEA, ATF. Everyone.

952
01:26:48,196 --> 01:26:51,643
And I would disappear
without a trace.

953
01:26:51,808 --> 01:26:54,336
Isabel and I wanted
to walk away together.

954
01:26:54,468 --> 01:26:56,541
What came in between?

955
01:26:56,707 --> 01:26:58,977
They call her "La Bruja."

956
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:01,431
The witch.

957
01:27:02,105 --> 01:27:05,725
She did black magic.

958
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:07,471
Santa Muerte.

959
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:14,450
That woman was
a merciless killer.

960
01:27:15,734 --> 01:27:20,803
So I had to put my loved one behind
bars for the rest of her life.

961
01:27:23,701 --> 01:27:27,222
I chose the police
and I still do that.

962
01:27:28,968 --> 01:27:32,390
Did you fuck a married witch?

963
01:27:34,203 --> 01:27:37,797
Is that your summary
of what I just told you?

964
01:27:37,922 --> 01:27:41,970
It is quite something. You
think you know someone...

965
01:27:42,136 --> 01:27:46,415
Now I understand why
you look like a drug dealer.

966
01:27:46,613 --> 01:27:48,555
Do you want to hear it or not?

967
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:53,459
You are not sure if he is your son. You
don't know who that witch was doing.

968
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:58,167
Benito Aretas was infertile.

969
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:02,150
Isabel gave birth to her son,
eight months after her arrest.

970
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:06,199
"Hasta el Fuego." He said that to
me when I jumped from that heli.

971
01:28:06,464 --> 01:28:08,372
Isabel and I made that up.

972
01:28:09,113 --> 01:28:11,968
It is not even good
Spanish. It was a joke.

973
01:28:12,093 --> 01:28:15,260
Something of:
together until we burn.

974
01:28:15,385 --> 01:28:17,392
The traitor is coming.

975
01:28:17,623 --> 01:28:19,466
Prepare yourself.

976
01:28:19,665 --> 01:28:22,594
I will. Come with me.

977
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:26,182
He's the right age.

978
01:28:26,347 --> 01:28:30,066
He is just as crazy,
ruthless and fearless as I am.

979
01:28:30,265 --> 01:28:32,173
He is the crazy version of me.

980
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:35,498
No, you are the crazy
version of yourself.

981
01:28:36,882 --> 01:28:39,053
You draw conclusions
too quickly.

982
01:28:39,252 --> 01:28:42,543
It will be fine by itself.
Trust that.

983
01:28:45,408 --> 01:28:46,808
You're right.

984
01:28:53,012 --> 01:28:54,412
I love you, man.

985
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:56,699
And I yours.

986
01:28:58,279 --> 01:29:00,254
I have to go.

987
01:29:59,148 --> 01:30:01,913
Can I pass?

988
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:09,023
That's a good place.

989
01:30:11,757 --> 01:30:13,237
I'm sitting there.

990
01:30:13,435 --> 01:30:17,022
Can I come and see
you? Remember your toes.

991
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:18,998
Very well.

992
01:30:22,554 --> 01:30:26,273
I'm not letting you go on
a suicide mission alone.

993
01:30:27,262 --> 01:30:31,870
This is my thing. I don't
want others to die as a result.

994
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:34,207
She is a 'bruja'.

995
01:30:34,406 --> 01:30:37,136
She can melt your
eyes in your head.

996
01:30:37,302 --> 01:30:39,309
And let your dick fall off.

997
01:30:40,923 --> 01:30:44,939
I meant penis. By the way, you
interfere with your own affairs.

998
01:30:46,223 --> 01:30:48,559
Marcus, please go home.

999
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:52,543
We fly together,
we die together.

1000
01:30:52,742 --> 01:30:55,177
That is just something we say.

1001
01:30:55,342 --> 01:30:57,613
There is nothing wrong.

1002
01:30:57,746 --> 01:31:00,345
I understand that a bit...

1003
01:31:01,334 --> 01:31:03,671
Where do you come from?

1004
01:31:08,742 --> 01:31:13,219
What will you do when you see him? Are
you going to put your son behind bars?

1005
01:31:13,417 --> 01:31:16,215
No. I kill him.

1006
01:31:17,533 --> 01:31:20,825
Are you really going
to kill your own son?

1007
01:31:21,715 --> 01:31:24,710
I'm going to put it
in a body bag.

1008
01:31:25,633 --> 01:31:28,233
Can we change places?

1009
01:31:33,865 --> 01:31:36,564
You know you're going
to hell then.

1010
01:31:36,762 --> 01:31:38,342
I don't believe in hell.

1011
01:31:38,508 --> 01:31:42,062
Hell is in you.
Killing your own son.

1012
01:31:42,294 --> 01:31:46,079
You will be completely
swallowed up by that darkness.

1013
01:31:46,278 --> 01:31:49,701
Maybe I have already
been swallowed.

1014
01:31:51,085 --> 01:31:53,553
I died, remember?

1015
01:31:53,719 --> 01:31:55,628
I'm putting an end to this.

1016
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:06,032
I should have known it was your son.
He really gave you a big beating.

1017
01:32:06,231 --> 01:32:09,655
A beating directly
from your loins.

1018
01:32:09,853 --> 01:32:12,058
A supernatural beating.

1019
01:32:19,369 --> 01:32:21,607
Can I be the godfather?

1020
01:32:21,805 --> 01:32:23,517
Do you know what you can be?

1021
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:25,426
What?
- Quiet.

1022
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:27,105
Do I have to be quiet?

1023
01:32:27,336 --> 01:32:30,431
You made a witch
baby with La Bruja...

1024
01:32:30,597 --> 01:32:33,493
who wants to kill you,
and me too...

1025
01:32:33,691 --> 01:32:38,102
and who wants to suck our
blood out, but I must be quiet.

1026
01:32:44,096 --> 01:32:47,191
Why do you fuck a witch
without a condom?

1027
01:32:47,356 --> 01:32:49,529
Pack that thing, man.

1028
01:32:49,727 --> 01:32:52,788
We have to change seats.

1029
01:34:05,193 --> 01:34:07,069
We are now even again.

1030
01:34:20,372 --> 01:34:21,772
We go.

1031
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,699
Did you call them again?
- Rita called me.

1032
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:43,207
Everything good?

1033
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:51,421
I feel better with them there.
- Me too.

1034
01:34:53,003 --> 01:34:55,306
How did you get that toy?

1035
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:59,916
The DEA in Cuernavaca. If we
catch her, they get the honor.

1036
01:35:00,114 --> 01:35:03,011
When we perish,
they know nothing.

1037
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:05,809
All eyes on me.  I'm the bait.

1038
01:35:06,008 --> 01:35:09,530
We're going to Hidalgo Palace.
An old hotel outside the city.

1039
01:35:09,729 --> 01:35:12,263
I'm talking to her, you're
looking for the shooter.

1040
01:35:12,429 --> 01:35:15,687
And if she shoots you?
- No, she just wants to talk.

1041
01:35:15,885 --> 01:35:18,618
We have a past together.

1042
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:22,668
We grab them and
fly home before dawn.

1043
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:26,850
Dorn, give me a map.

1044
01:35:27,015 --> 01:35:30,010
We can watch from the outside...

1045
01:35:30,209 --> 01:35:31,656
and...

1046
01:35:32,777 --> 01:35:34,258
from the inside.

1047
01:35:34,456 --> 01:35:38,011
Stay away from the shooter.
That's mine.

1048
01:35:38,177 --> 01:35:39,888
Indeed.

1049
01:35:53,718 --> 01:35:56,779
You color outside the lines today,
don't you?

1050
01:36:00,468 --> 01:36:02,276
Do not die.

1051
01:36:02,474 --> 01:36:05,072
Make sure we both come home.

1052
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:33,591
No threats yet.

1053
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:37,966
I keep an eye on everything
inside. Outside I block everything.

1054
01:36:38,098 --> 01:36:42,209
She really isn't alone.
- This is the cartel. That is not nothing.

1055
01:36:42,441 --> 01:36:46,321
Marcus walks to the rear.
- We see your position from the air.

1056
01:36:46,519 --> 01:36:50,103
I don't see anything yet.
I'm getting closer.

1057
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:34,233
Hola, Ricky.

1058
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:36,731
Or should I call you Mike?

1059
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:38,325
Hola, Isabel.

1060
01:37:55,805 --> 01:37:58,027
Not very thorough.

1061
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:03,473
You melted once when
you touched me.

1062
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:05,599
I finish her myself.

1063
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:09,304
Keep it.

1064
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:13,686
Where is he?

1065
01:38:13,913 --> 01:38:16,619
This was once our place.

1066
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,713
I wanted to kill you...

1067
01:38:18,908 --> 01:38:20,646
but you survived.

1068
01:38:21,582 --> 01:38:24,223
Maybe I made you too strong.

1069
01:38:25,622 --> 01:38:27,022
Or maybe...

1070
01:38:28,264 --> 01:38:30,454
Santa Muerte wants to
tell us something.

1071
01:38:33,517 --> 01:38:36,061
We had to meet one more time.

1072
01:38:36,555 --> 01:38:38,939
This is fierce telenovela shit.

1073
01:38:49,576 --> 01:38:51,187
I already arranged that.

1074
01:38:55,182 --> 01:38:56,857
Everything is gone.

1075
01:38:58,212 --> 01:39:00,434
Marcus, can you hear me?

1076
01:39:00,628 --> 01:39:05,404
They disturb us. They know we are here.
- I still have Baby Barry.

1077
01:39:05,533 --> 01:39:07,669
Now we are alone.

1078
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:10,857
Why didn't you say I had a son?

1079
01:39:16,281 --> 01:39:17,681
What did you do then?

1080
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:20,849
Cared for him.

1081
01:39:21,047 --> 01:39:22,624
Like you took care of me?

1082
01:39:28,016 --> 01:39:32,222
It had to be a
surprise. After we fled.

1083
01:39:41,361 --> 01:39:42,761
People are coming.

1084
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,191
About 20, 30.
- We have to go there.

1085
01:39:46,316 --> 01:39:47,375
Other entrances?

1086
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:50,662
That might be
a ventilation shaft.

1087
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,080
How could you do that to our son?
- My son.

1088
01:39:54,344 --> 01:40:00,127
Who does he think I am?
- What you are: a coward and traitor.

1089
01:40:03,153 --> 01:40:04,664
Do not do this.

1090
01:40:14,230 --> 01:40:15,708
Walk.

1091
01:40:24,748 --> 01:40:26,127
Do you see that?

1092
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,660
Let drop.

1093
01:40:28,461 --> 01:40:31,157
Bring it on.

1094
01:40:31,618 --> 01:40:32,996
What are you going to do?

1095
01:40:33,121 --> 01:40:34,541
Hasta el fuego.

1096
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:38,453
Do not. That means fire, right?
- Cállate.

1097
01:40:38,685 --> 01:40:42,233
You must talk.
This is a heavy shit.

1098
01:40:42,465 --> 01:40:45,224
Careful with that thing.
- Calm down, Marcus.

1099
01:40:45,686 --> 01:40:49,168
This is all because
you are not talking.

1100
01:40:49,367 --> 01:40:52,453
He must tell you something. It
is not pleasant, but it has to.

1101
01:41:23,821 --> 01:41:25,857
Mike, they're going to the heli.

1102
01:41:29,142 --> 01:41:30,542
Marcus.

1103
01:41:37,539 --> 01:41:38,939
Put on your glasses.

1104
01:41:39,127 --> 01:41:41,425
You just pitched badly.

1105
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:47,863
Mike, be careful.

1106
01:41:51,017 --> 01:41:54,564
You were right with the glasses.
- I've been saying that for years.

1107
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:03,398
It looks like hd.

1108
01:42:07,505 --> 01:42:09,015
Forward.

1109
01:42:15,618 --> 01:42:17,424
12 o'clock contact.

1110
01:42:30,365 --> 01:42:31,875
Run.

1111
01:42:40,022 --> 01:42:42,550
Isabel and the shooter
went up the stairs.

1112
01:42:42,813 --> 01:42:44,213
Can you cover us?

1113
01:42:44,357 --> 01:42:46,557
Kelly, right flank.

1114
01:42:46,755 --> 01:42:49,644
Rafe, to the left.

1115
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:51,878
Dorn, follow Rafe.

1116
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:57,231
Great guy, you have to hurt some
people. I'll pay for your therapy.

1117
01:42:57,463 --> 01:43:00,450
I really need that. - Okay fine.

1118
01:43:00,682 --> 01:43:04,161
I will stay here. You go to the stairs.
- To the stairs.

1119
01:43:06,035 --> 01:43:09,943
Good job, inspector.
- You too.

1120
01:43:10,305 --> 01:43:12,012
You are not that stupid.

1121
01:43:12,243 --> 01:43:13,643
On my mark.

1122
01:43:14,870 --> 01:43:16,270
Now.

1123
01:43:20,979 --> 01:43:22,379
New weapon.

1124
01:43:36,384 --> 01:43:37,784
Come on.

1125
01:43:49,555 --> 01:43:51,261
Shoot them down.

1126
01:43:51,657 --> 01:43:53,057
Over there.

1127
01:44:20,889 --> 01:44:23,154
How did they get all
those helis?

1128
01:44:49,661 --> 01:44:51,061
Mike.

1129
01:44:51,698 --> 01:44:53,536
Shoot the pilot.
- On the rotor.

1130
01:44:56,493 --> 01:44:58,496
What are you shooting at?
- The pilot.

1131
01:44:59,318 --> 01:45:02,010
Shoot the rotor. If
you shoot the pilot...

1132
01:45:03,325 --> 01:45:04,725
Touch.

1133
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:20,206
You have a crazy family, Mike.

1134
01:45:36,729 --> 01:45:38,129
The whole thing is collapsing.
Get out.

1135
01:45:38,371 --> 01:45:40,012
Mike?  Marcus?

1136
01:45:58,636 --> 01:46:00,278
On your knees, Isabel.

1137
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:37,885
Let that be a lesson to you,
witch.

1138
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:40,608
Armando...

1139
01:47:43,444 --> 01:47:44,844
you are my son.

1140
01:47:49,455 --> 01:47:50,867
You are my son.

1141
01:47:54,251 --> 01:47:56,024
I don't want to fight.

1142
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,000
Stay down.

1143
01:48:19,312 --> 01:48:21,019
Stay down, I said.

1144
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:30,018
I did not know.
If I had known...

1145
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:41,579
Mike, what are you doing?

1146
01:48:44,963 --> 01:48:51,663
I try to penetrate his
soul with my heart.

1147
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:56,656
No, Mike.
I had a hard time then.

1148
01:49:06,346 --> 01:49:07,746
Who are you?

1149
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:10,439
I already said that.

1150
01:49:11,568 --> 01:49:12,968
Liar.

1151
01:49:23,233 --> 01:49:24,633
Your last chance.

1152
01:49:27,702 --> 01:49:29,102
Who are you?

1153
01:49:31,908 --> 01:49:33,385
Just ask your mother.

1154
01:49:41,931 --> 01:49:44,066
Is it true what he says?

1155
01:49:46,432 --> 01:49:49,093
Does not matter. He
means nothing to you.

1156
01:49:49,259 --> 01:49:51,689
Do you see all those fuego?

1157
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:54,416
Is this possible outside?
- Shut up.

1158
01:49:54,582 --> 01:49:56,749
Who is he? - Say it.

1159
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:58,381
Say it, mama.

1160
01:50:01,548 --> 01:50:03,519
Is he my father?

1161
01:50:05,656 --> 01:50:07,593
Is he my father?

1162
01:50:07,824 --> 01:50:09,224
Yes.

1163
01:50:11,964 --> 01:50:13,364
Finish him.

1164
01:50:23,794 --> 01:50:25,699
Wait.

1165
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:58,723
Lay down.

1166
01:51:06,676 --> 01:51:09,370
We have to get out of here.
- We have to leave. Now.

1167
01:51:10,783 --> 01:51:12,183
We have to get out of here.

1168
01:51:19,195 --> 01:51:21,823
Hold on.  Hold on.

1169
01:51:23,861 --> 01:51:25,800
Do not let me go.

1170
01:51:28,363 --> 01:51:29,763
I have got you.

1171
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:32,897
I can't come to you.

1172
01:51:33,095 --> 01:51:34,495
I don't like it.

1173
01:51:36,611 --> 01:51:39,141
To pull.
I don't want to die like that.

1174
01:51:43,314 --> 01:51:44,714
I don't like it anymore.

1175
01:51:50,905 --> 01:51:53,533
Hurry up.
My ass is almost done.

1176
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,820
We have to get out of here.

1177
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:18,704
Bullet wound in the chest.
Give him medical assistance.

1178
01:52:19,756 --> 01:52:21,858
I got him. - Put it down.

1179
01:52:22,155 --> 01:52:24,355
Give him a trauma.

1180
01:52:32,966 --> 01:52:34,366
Calm.

1181
01:52:34,674 --> 01:52:39,307
I can't promise that everything
will be fine after what you did...

1182
01:52:40,819 --> 01:52:43,282
but I will be there for you.

1183
01:52:49,922 --> 01:52:51,630
I'm your uncle Marcus.

1184
01:52:52,846 --> 01:52:54,949
But that will come later.

1185
01:53:21,566 --> 01:53:23,033
Boys.
- There he is.

1186
01:53:25,837 --> 01:53:29,385
Time to toast on our
new Chief Inspector.

1187
01:53:29,945 --> 01:53:31,981
On our new chief inspector.

1188
01:53:33,165 --> 01:53:36,647
My mother's greetings.
- You keep reminding me of that, don't you?

1189
01:53:36,845 --> 01:53:39,177
I have news for you.

1190
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:44,698
According to my therapist it is
good to do a group session together.

1191
01:53:44,864 --> 01:53:47,951
It is really cool. - Yeah right.

1192
01:53:48,116 --> 01:53:51,960
Marcus, I want to talk to you.
- I will think about it.

1193
01:53:53,013 --> 01:53:54,589
He wants us to go into therapy.

1194
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:57,283
I'm not going.
- Me neither.

1195
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:05,268
We don't say these kinds
of things to each other, but...

1196
01:54:07,405 --> 01:54:08,805
Thanks.

1197
01:54:10,198 --> 01:54:11,841
You do not have to thank me.

1198
01:54:12,827 --> 01:54:18,708
If you want to stop, I'm
not going to stop you.

1199
01:54:18,906 --> 01:54:23,604
You've earned it. And I'm
100 percent behind you.

1200
01:54:23,868 --> 01:54:26,134
You forget one thing.

1201
01:54:26,332 --> 01:54:28,270
We said 'for life'.

1202
01:54:28,928 --> 01:54:30,571
For life, buddy.

1203
01:54:34,186 --> 01:54:38,620
There is my nephew.
- Little Marcus just woke up.

1204
01:54:38,884 --> 01:54:40,724
But first something else.

1205
01:54:41,678 --> 01:54:45,850
I have a surprise for you. Three
days at the Marion Springs Resort.

1206
01:54:46,114 --> 01:54:50,385
As a saving grace for
the time it didn't happen.

1207
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:54,427
Yes, just the two of us.

1208
01:54:54,625 --> 01:54:58,304
But Megan and Reggie
are on a honeymoon.

1209
01:54:58,634 --> 01:55:01,853
I have the baby this
weekend. Together with AMMO.

1210
01:55:02,117 --> 01:55:05,895
Then you can go with Theresa. Do
you still have those blue pills?

1211
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:09,411
I don't need that.
- That's what you said about your glasses.

1212
01:55:09,608 --> 01:55:11,218
That baby looks good on you.

1213
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,109
Yes, it fits you well.

1214
01:55:14,308 --> 01:55:16,213
Do you think?
- Yes.

1215
01:55:17,922 --> 01:55:20,287
You can manage, don't you?
We're going, guys.

1216
01:55:20,551 --> 01:55:23,902
Wait a minute. We
would do this together.

1217
01:55:24,297 --> 01:55:27,615
I have to work. I'll come
by tomorrow. With wine.

1218
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:32,749
Don't, Rita. We would
all look after the baby.

1219
01:55:32,874 --> 01:55:34,162
I am in the car.

1220
01:55:34,287 --> 01:55:35,687
App my mother.

1221
01:55:36,028 --> 01:55:38,097
That is not...

1222
01:55:52,754 --> 01:55:56,992
We don't do that with
the next generation.

1223
01:55:57,223 --> 01:55:59,029
You have to sing well.

1224
01:56:10,581 --> 01:56:12,337

01:56:38,101 --> 01:56:39,676
How are you?

1226
01:56:39,874 --> 01:56:41,274
I'm serving my sentence.

1227
01:56:43,161 --> 01:56:44,770
A long sentence.

1228
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:51,243
There may be a chance
to make it a little shorter.

1229
01:56:51,934 --> 01:56:53,346
Interested?

1230
01:56:55,877 --> 01:56:57,277
Yes man.
