1
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,557
My planet
Arrakis is so beautiful

2
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,192
when the sun is low.

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,098
Rolling over the sands...

4
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,101
you can see spice in the air.

5
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,417
At nightfall,
the spice harvesters land.

6
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,054
The outsiders
race against time

7
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,457
to avoid the heat of the day.

8
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:43,236
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

9
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,240
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

10
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,347
These outsiders,
the Harkonnens,

11
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,449
came long before I was born.

12
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,451
By controlling
spice production,

13
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,353
they became obscenely rich.

14
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,156
Richer than
the Emperor himself.

15
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,334
Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

16
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,636
but one day,

17
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,039
by Imperial decree,
they were gone.

18
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,315
Why did the Emperor
choose this path?

19
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,085
And who will
our next oppressors be?

20
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,105
It's good you're up early.

21
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,833
Your father wants you
in full dress

22
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,610
before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

23
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,778
Full dress?

24
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,381
Military?

25
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,984
Ceremonial.

26
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,394
Why do we have to go
through all this

27
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,920
when it's already
been decided?

28
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,389
Ceremony.

29
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,091
Mm.

30
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,993
Thank you.

31
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,830
If you want it,
make me give it to you.

32
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,231
Use the Voice.

33
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,068
Mom, I just woke up.

34
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,311
Give me the water.

35
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,680
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

36
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,143
Give me the water.

37
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,623
Almost.

38
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,058
Almost?

39
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,560
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

40
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,530
- Mm-hmm.
- You look tired.

41
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,732
More dreams?

42
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,405
No.

43
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,010
Extreme temperatures

44
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,745
and treacherous weather events

45
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,582
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,

46
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,551
with sandstorms
powerful enough

47
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,252
to cut through metal.

48
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,055
Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen

49
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:59,726
have adapted
well enough to survive.

50
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:04,263
Preferring to inhabit the
remotest regions of Arrakis,

51
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,265
the Fremen share
the deep desert

52
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,934
with the giant sandworms

53
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,437
known to the Fremen
as Shai-Hulud.

54
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,107
Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe

55
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,876
their characteristic
blue eyes,

56
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,911
the Eyes of Ibad.

57
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,014
Little else is known
of the Fremen,

58
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:26,119
except that they are
dangerous and unreliable.

59
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,921
Fremen attacks
make spice harvesting

60
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,890
extremely hazardous.

61
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,627
For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen

62
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,062
which preserves life

63
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,931
and brings
enormous health benefits.

64
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,633
For the Imperium,

65
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,869
spice is used
by the navigators

66
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,637
of the Spacing Guild

67
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,607
to find safe paths
between the stars.

68
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,908
Without spice,

69
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,978
interstellar travel
is impossible,

70
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,546
making it by far

71
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,816
the most valuable substance
in the universe.

72
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,300
Smile, Gurney.

73
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,470
I am smiling.

74
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,039
How much will it cost them,

75
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,641
traveling all this way
for this formality?

76
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,043
Three Guild Navigators.

77
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,813
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

78
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,799
By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

79
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,834
ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

80
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,737
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

81
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,075
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

82
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,078
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

83
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,680
representatives
of the Spacing Guild

84
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,050
and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

85
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,821
The Emperor has spoken.

86
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,058
"House Atreides
shall immediately

87
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,894
take control of Arrakis

88
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,163
and serve as its steward."

89
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,767
Do you accept?

90
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,846
We are House Atreides.

91
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,848
There is no call
we do not answer,

92
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,250
there is no faith
that we betray.

93
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,355
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

94
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,858
House Atreides accepts.

95
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,296
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

96
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,867
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

97
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,475
Your seal.

98
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,512
So, it's done?

99
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,616
It's done.

100
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,677
How was it?

101
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,254
Stabilizers are too loose.

102
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,347
- We'll dial it in.
- Thank you, my friend.

103
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,515
Got it.

104
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,217
Duncan.

105
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,385
My boy.

106
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,886
Hey. Hey.

107
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,521
Paul, my boy.

108
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,692
So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

109
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,227
With the advance team.

110
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,795
Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

111
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,130
with the advance team.

112
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,066
I'd like you
to take me with you.

113
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,701
You would?

114
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,637
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.

115
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,140
Duncan.

116
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,475
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

117
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,644
What's going on?

118
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,146
Can I trust you
with something?

119
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,480
Always. You know that.

120
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,855
I've been having dreams.

121
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,927
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

122
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,937
Okay.

123
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,238
So?

124
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,874
I saw you.

125
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,280
With the Fremen.

126
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,115
Ah.

127
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,616
So, I do find them.

128
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,052
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

129
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,622
Lanville!

130
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,931
I saw you lying dead.

131
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,633
Fallen in battle.

132
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,270
It felt like
if I had been there,

133
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,139
you'd be alive.

134
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,612
First off, I'm not gonna die.

135
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,912
You're not
taking me seriously.

136
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,982
That's why
you want to come with me.

137
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,417
Listen.

138
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,152
Dreams make good stories,

139
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,654
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

140
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,823
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

141
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,259
Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

142
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,560
I did?

143
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,895
No.

144
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,066
Hey.

145
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,301
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

146
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,705
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

147
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,542
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

148
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,602
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

149
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,878
Out of the question.

150
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,322
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

151
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,481
like the rest of us.

152
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,849
I've been training
my whole life.

153
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,184
What is the point

154
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,628
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

155
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,886
You know why, Paul.

156
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,055
You're the future
of House Atreides.

157
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,558
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

158
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,359
Yes.

159
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,061
And look where that got him.

160
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,734
I need you by my side.

161
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,871
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

162
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,506
What danger?

163
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,474
The Fremen? The desert?

164
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,510
Political danger.

165
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,648
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

166
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,750
and this threatens
the Emperor.

167
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,087
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

168
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,256
he sets the stage for a war

169
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,491
which would weaken
both houses.

170
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,761
But if we hold firm,

171
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,930
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

172
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,333
we could be stronger
than ever.

173
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,034
What does that mean?

174
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,236
Mining spice,

175
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,837
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

176
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,181
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

177
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,607
No.

178
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,843
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

179
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,613
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

180
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,215
Here on Caladan,

181
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,784
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

182
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,722
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

183
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,760
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

184
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,228
Learn what I do.

185
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,063
What if I'm not, Dad?

186
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,100
Not what?

187
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,137
The future of House Atreides.

188
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,952
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

189
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,758
I wanted to be a pilot.

190
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,394
You never told me that.

191
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,499
Your grandfather said,

192
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,335
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

193
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,072
He's called to it,
and he answers."

194
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,642
And if your answer is no...

195
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,949
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

196
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,018
my son.

197
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:07,132
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

198
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,471
In their memory...

199
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,809
give it a try.

200
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,820
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

201
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,556
How many times
do we have to tell you?

202
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,096
I could tell it was you

203
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,892
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

204
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,729
Someone
might imitate my stride.

205
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,063
I know the difference.

206
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,732
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

207
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,569
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

208
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,071
Choose your blade.

209
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,906
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

210
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,042
Give us a song instead.

211
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,714
That's rude.

212
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,767
Come on.

213
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,868
Come on.

214
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,169
Old man.

215
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,383
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

216
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,292
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

217
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,593
- Mood?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,795
What's mood to do with it?

219
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,630
You fight
when the necessity arises,

220
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,731
no matter the mood.

221
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,899
Now fight!

222
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,405
Come on!

223
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,453
I have you.

224
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,254
Aye.

225
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,989
But look down, my lord.

226
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,659
You'd have joined me in death.

227
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,627
I see you found the mood.

228
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,441
Will it be that bad?

229
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,010
You don't get it, do you?

230
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,345
You don't really understand

231
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,115
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

232
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,018
For 80 years,

233
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,254
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

234
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,823
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

235
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,025
Can you imagine the wealth?

236
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,027
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

237
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,630
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

238
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,766
They're not human,
they're brutal!

239
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,768
You have to be ready.

240
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,878
Lord Baron.

241
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,082
Rabban.

242
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,852
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

243
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,221
It's done.

244
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,822
Very good.

245
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,894
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

246
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,030
How can the Emperor

247
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,666
take everything we've built

248
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,035
and give it to that Duke?

249
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,403
How?

250
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,406
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

251
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,276
What does he mean?

252
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,718
When is a gift not a gift?

253
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,023
The Atreides' voice is rising,

254
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,393
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

255
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,632
A dangerous, jealous man.

256
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,338
Paul.

257
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,541
Paul, wake up.

258
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,381
What's wrong?

259
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,784
Get dressed and come with me.

260
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,572
What is this?

261
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,575
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

262
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,811
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

263
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,414
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

264
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,383
She would like to meet you.

265
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,585
Why?

266
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,021
She wants to know
about your dreams.

267
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,224
How does she know
about my dreams?

268
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,428
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

269
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,897
He only needs a moment.

270
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,999
Hello, young master.

271
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,769
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

272
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,076
What's happening?

273
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,434
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

274
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:37,649
Paul...

275
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:11,283
Who are you?

276
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,923
Defiance in the eyes.

277
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,658
Like his father.

278
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,326
Leave us.

279
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,470
You must do everything

280
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,862
the Reverend Mother tells you.

281
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,910
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

282
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,414
Come here.

283
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,770
Kneel.

284
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,809
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

285
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,070
Put
your right hand in the box.

286
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,022
Your mother bade you obey me.

287
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,566
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

288
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,302
A poison needle.

289
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,670
Instant death.

290
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,240
The test is simple.

291
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,876
Remove your hand from the box

292
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,544
and you die.

293
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,247
What's in the box?

294
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,582
Pain.

295
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,387
No need to call the guards.

296
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,089
Your mother stands
behind that door.

297
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,891
No one would get past her.

298
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,366
Why are you doing this?

299
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,435
An animal caught in a trap

300
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,338
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

301
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,340
What will you do?

302
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,374
Silence.

303
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:27,052
I must not fear.

304
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,388
I must not fear.

305
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,663
Fear is the mind-killer.

306
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,000
Fear

307
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,469
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

308
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,007
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

309
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,307
to pass over me
and through me.

310
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,958
And when it has gone past...

311
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,503
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

312
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,275
And where the fear
has gone,

313
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,144
there will be nothing.

314
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,651
Only I will remain.

315
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,189
Enough.

316
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,409
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

317
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,078
we sift people.

318
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,048
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

319
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,716
like an animal,

320
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,018
we could not let you live.

321
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,754
You inherit too much power.

322
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,032
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

323
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,858
Because you are Jessica's son.

324
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,561
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

325
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,230
Jessica?

326
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,606
You've been training him
in the Way.

327
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,714
Tell me about these dreams.

328
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,916
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

329
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,220
A girl.

330
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,955
On Arrakis.

331
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,423
Have you dreamt of her before?

332
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,862
Many times.

333
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,600
Do you often dream
things that happen

334
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,868
just as you dreamed them?

335
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,573
Not exactly.

336
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,811
Goodbye, young human.

337
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,247
I hope you live.

338
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,157
Did you have to go that far?

339
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,992
You chose
to train him in the Way,

340
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,994
in defiance of our rule.

341
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,629
He wields our power.

342
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,499
He had to be
tested to the limits.

343
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,835
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

344
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,904
You were told
to bear only daughters.

345
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,339
But you, in your pride,

346
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,341
thought you could
produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

347
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,842
Was I wrong?

348
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,678
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

349
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,014
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

350
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,151
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

351
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,088
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

352
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,689
We have other prospects

353
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,159
if he fails his promise.

354
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,264
Do you see so little hope?

355
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,698
On Arrakis,
we have done

356
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,433
all we can for you.

357
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,335
A path has been laid.

358
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,671
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

359
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,253
Paul.

360
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,722
What does it mean?

361
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,758
That I could be The One?

362
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,193
You heard.

363
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,831
The Bene Gesserit serve

364
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,400
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

365
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,703
but there's more to it.

366
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,339
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

367
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,840
from the shadows.

368
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,542
I know.

369
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,078
You don't know everything.

370
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,447
For thousands of years,

371
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,183
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

372
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,385
- to bring forth...
- The One?

373
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,021
A mind...

374
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:36,094
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

375
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,730
Past and future.

376
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,034
Who can help us
into a better future.

377
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,905
We think he's very close now.

378
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,042
Some believe he's here.

379
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,048
All part of a plan.

380
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,187
Shield.

381
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,498
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

382
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,600
Blown past falling sand..."

383
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,379
Thufir Hawat.

384
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,352
Young master!

385
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,721
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

386
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,723
Exciting, to say the least.

387
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,292
My lord.

388
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,994
How are you, old friend?

389
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,396
My advance team
has secured the city.

390
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,499
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

391
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,469
My lady.

392
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,875
Lisan al-Gaib!

393
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,661
Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!

394
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,730
Lisan al-Gaib!

395
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,066
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

396
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,102
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

397
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,105
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

398
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,209
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

399
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,679
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

400
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,614
They follow
their old masters' rules.

401
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,848
Mandatory attendance.

402
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,218
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

403
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,292
Atreides!

404
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,963
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

405
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,800
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

406
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,369
Atreides! Atreides!

407
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:23,241
Let's get you
out of the sun.

408
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,810
The heat can kill
in this place.

409
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,794
They were pointing at us.

410
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,130
What are they shouting?

411
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,134
Lisan al-Gaib.
"Voice from the Outer World."

412
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,937
It's their name for "messiah."

413
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:56,307
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

414
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,843
Planting superstitions.

415
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,746
Preparing the way, Paul.

416
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,148
These people
have waited for centuries

417
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,983
for the Lisan al-Gaib.

418
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,785
They see you,

419
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,521
they see the signs.

420
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,593
They see
what they've been told to see.

421
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,699
We're good to go.

422
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,544
Shield Wall.

423
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,512
Protects the city
from the weather

424
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,081
and the worms.

425
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,764
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

426
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,135
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

427
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,770
on our comms system.

428
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,441
It's so quiet.

429
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,544
Yeah.

430
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,479
That's what worries me, too.

431
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,988
There's the spaceport

432
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,724
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

433
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,893
Our two
most vulnerable points.

434
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,261
I want you guarding them.

435
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,963
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

436
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,099
- we're dead here.
- My lord.

437
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,802
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

438
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,675
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

439
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,244
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

440
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,846
That's what they say.

441
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,581
That's what they say.

442
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,822
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

443
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,105
What is your name?

444
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,341
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

445
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,178
The rest of you may go.

446
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,379
Thank you.

447
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,650
Shadout.

448
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,519
It's an old Chakobsa word.

449
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,721
"Well-dipper."

450
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:34,968
You know the ancient tongues?

451
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,460
I know many things.

452
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,697
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

453
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,467
If you mean to harm me,

454
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:46,036
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

455
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,639
it won't be enough.

456
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,877
The weapon is meant as a gift

457
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,013
if you are truly The One.

458
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,430
Do you know this?

459
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,400
It's a crysknife.

460
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,605
Do you know its meaning?

461
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,444
It's a maker...

462
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,019
A maker of the deep desert.

463
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,957
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

464
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,626
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

465
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,395
Lisan al-Gaib.

466
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,597
The mother and the son.

467
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,271
It is yours.

468
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,476
Tooth of Shai-Hulud.

469
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,409
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!

470
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:36,614
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

471
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,158
Hello.

472
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,263
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

473
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,668
They're out here.

474
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,371
Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

475
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,439
They don't care
about heatstroke.

476
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,378
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

477
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,614
Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

478
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:13,150
They can't survive without me.

479
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,451
Each one of these

480
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,121
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

481
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,891
Twenty palm trees.

482
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,728
A hundred lives.

483
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,864
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

484
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,365
No, no, no.

485
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,034
These are sacred.

486
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,873
Old dream.

487
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,916
The largest and most dangerous

488
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,986
organism on Arrakis
is the sandworm,

489
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:53,190
capable of reaching
400 meters in length.

490
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,659
To avoid making
rhythmic noises,

491
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,227
which attract the sandworms,

492
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,265
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,

493
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,368
a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm

494
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,439
which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.

495
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:11,175
What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis

496
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,843
is thanks to the Fremen,

497
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,846
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants

498
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,949
such as saguaro, burrobush,

499
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,120
sand-verbena and incense bush.

500
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,457
The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,

501
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:31,061
stretching more than
450 feet deep.

502
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,030
These plants cling to life

503
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,400
in a parched,
nutrient-poor landscape.

504
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,272
It's a hunter-seeker.

505
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,374
The operator must be nearby.

506
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,956
The Harkonnen agent
was cemented

507
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,849
into that hole six weeks ago.

508
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,651
Ran the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe

509
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:01,819
inside the walls.

510
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,190
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

511
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,691
You have my resignation.

512
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,135
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

513
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,360
Sire, my honor demands...

514
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,162
They tried to take
the life of my son!

515
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,798
I don't give a damn
about your honor.

516
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,467
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

517
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,735
Your Grace.

518
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,312
The thing must leave.

519
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,881
You can speak
without fear.

520
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,250
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

521
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,818
Get out.

522
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,991
It understands.

523
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,593
Activate silence.

524
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,510
It must
never be known.

525
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,513
There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

526
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,217
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

527
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,952
On that matter,

528
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,222
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

529
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,258
But his wife
is under our protection

530
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,960
and by extension, her son.

531
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,563
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

532
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,636
House Harkonnen
would never dream

533
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,705
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

534
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,408
I give you my word.

535
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,143
We will not harm them.

536
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:54,932
If the Duke's son lives...

537
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,501
No Atreides will live.

538
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,003
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

539
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,171
She sees too much.

540
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,006
I said I would not harm them.

541
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,341
And I shall not.

542
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,743
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

543
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,514
And the desert takes the weak.

544
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,850
My desert.

545
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,655
My Arrakis.

546
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,259
My Dune.

547
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,798
Your first
strategy meeting.

548
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,099
Paul Atreides,

549
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,101
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

550
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,302
like a hero of old.

551
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,873
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

552
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,275
Gotta keep an eye on you.

553
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,444
Attention!

554
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,820
Let's get started.

555
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,057
Thufir. Operations.

556
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,827
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

557
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,564
The Harkonnens were taking

558
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,134
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

559
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,870
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

560
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,472
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

561
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,907
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

562
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,176
Not with the equipment
they left us.

563
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,746
How bad is it?

564
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,487
These are spice silos.

565
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,924
We're meant
to fill every crate.

566
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,926
All of them?

567
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,863
Every 25 standard days.

568
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,265
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

569
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,067
But who's
meant to arbitrate?

570
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,411
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

571
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,736
to oversee the transition?

572
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,238
Who did the Emperor appoint?

573
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,107
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

574
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,709
Been here 20 years.

575
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,611
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

576
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,747
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

577
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,215
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

578
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,751
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

579
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,286
A meeting's long overdue.

580
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,588
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

581
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,190
A hostage.

582
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,558
I love it.

583
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,726
Hmm.

584
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,062
He's here, my lord.

585
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,954
Take care
of them. They are friends.

586
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,054
Duncan!

587
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,457
Ah! My boy!

588
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,462
I swear you're getting taller.

589
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,165
Well,
you smell much worse.

590
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,838
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

591
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,005
Hidden in the desert,

592
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,807
in a community
called a sietch.

593
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,251
Stilgar, the leader
of that sietch,

594
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,077
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

595
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,480
This sietch, how is it hidden?

596
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,647
It's underground.

597
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,683
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

598
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,451
How big was the place?

599
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,987
I'd say 10,000 people.

600
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,622
And there are
hundreds of sietches.

601
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,258
Millions of Fremen.

602
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,494
You were right.

603
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,930
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

604
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,199
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

605
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,767
I never saw them.

606
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,537
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

607
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,205
And I gotta tell you,

608
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,708
I have never come
so close to dying.

609
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,611
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

610
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,279
They fight like demons.

611
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,214
Desert power.

612
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,385
Duncan.

613
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:36,953
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

614
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,388
Sire.

615
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,057
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

616
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,227
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

617
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,529
Let him pass.

618
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,547
Stop there.

619
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,315
Hey! Hey!

620
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:09,886
Mm.

621
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,888
Stilgar.

622
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,024
Welcome.

623
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,594
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

624
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,496
of any man that respects mine.

625
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,833
Hmm.

626
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,572
Hold.

627
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,741
Thank you, Stilgar,

628
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:35,245
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

629
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,681
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

630
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:46,809
I'm glad you've come.

631
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,626
I believe your people and mine

632
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,027
have much
to offer one another.

633
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,462
No, no, you are Outworlders.

634
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,231
You come here for the spice,

635
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,766
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

636
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,569
That's true.

637
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,407
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

638
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,043
Name what you want.

639
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,311
If it's in my power to grant,

640
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,879
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

641
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,816
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our sietches.

642
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,752
Do not trespass in our lands.

643
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,289
The desert was ours
long before you came.

644
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,157
So, come and dig your spice,

645
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,459
but when you have it,

646
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,661
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

647
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,563
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

648
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,432
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

649
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,102
Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

650
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,503
The Emperor

651
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,339
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

652
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,174
to rule and protect.

653
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,777
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

654
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,680
if duty compels me.

655
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,683
But your sietches
will be yours forever.

656
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,352
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

657
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,692
That's very honorable.

658
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,461
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

659
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,697
Won't you stay?

660
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,165
We would honor you.

661
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,335
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

662
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,281
I don't like him.

663
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,617
Our plan bears fruit.

664
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:22,118
But it will take time?

665
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,453
Yes.

666
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,690
It will take time.

667
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,827
Here, this is for you.

668
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,900
It's a paracompass.

669
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,502
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

670
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,205
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

671
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,407
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

672
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,176
The Fremen make these?

673
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,078
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

674
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,579
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

675
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,648
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

676
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,994
That's a sand compactor.

677
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,922
My God, man,
you've gone native.

678
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,323
You admire them.

679
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,093
I do.

680
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,862
They're fierce but loyal.

681
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,731
They're attuned to the desert.

682
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,065
Part of it.

683
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,267
It's part of them.

684
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,535
You wait till you see it.

685
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,771
It's beautiful out there.

686
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,076
Sunrise warning, all workers.

687
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,113
Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.

688
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,948
We are currently 90 degrees,

689
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,418
and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.

690
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:30,787
Last warning call.

691
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,256
The Judge of the Change, sire.

692
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,291
Dr. Liet Kynes.

693
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,793
My lord Duke.

694
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,162
Welcome to Arrakis.

695
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,330
You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

696
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,332
Thank you for the stillsuits.

697
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,501
They are of Fremen make.

698
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,669
The best.

699
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,070
With your permission, sire,

700
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,581
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

701
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,740
Whoa.

702
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,642
It's all right.

703
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,479
It's all right.

704
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,149
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

705
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,855
A stillsuit

706
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,926
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

707
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,594
Even this early
in the morning,

708
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,464
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

709
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:50,633
It cools the body

710
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,537
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

711
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,941
Your body's movements
provide the power.

712
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,709
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

713
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,878
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

714
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,213
Mm.

715
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,690
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

716
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,016
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

717
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,451
Most impressive.

718
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,488
Let's have a look at you, lad.

719
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,225
You've...

720
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,526
worn a stillsuit before?

721
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,228
No, this is my first time.

722
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,066
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

723
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,001
Who taught you to do that?

724
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,136
It seemed the right way.

725
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:35,964
Are you Fremen?

726
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,584
I am accepted
in both sietch and village.

727
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,354
Now, come and see
the spice sands

728
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,490
on which
your livelihood depends.

729
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,629
What would you do

730
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,264
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

731
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,466
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

732
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,135
It's worm territory.

733
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,872
Dust cloud.

734
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,142
I see it.

735
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,377
That's one of your harvesters.

736
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,547
You can see the spice

737
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,440
scattered over the surface.

738
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,943
A rich spice bed

739
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,478
by the color.

740
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,081
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

741
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,431
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

742
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,668
Wormsign?

743
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:41,037
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

744
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,339
Worms travel deep
but get closer

745
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,807
to the surface
when they attack.

746
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,110
If you are patient,

747
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,046
we should see one.

748
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,614
A worm always comes?

749
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:54,484
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

750
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,653
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

751
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,222
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

752
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,556
It attracts the worms

753
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,326
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

754
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,130
Is that a worm?

755
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,144
Big one.

756
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,546
You have good eyes.

757
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,882
Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

758
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,484
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

759
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,254
Who calls Delta Ajax niner?

760
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,388
Over.

761
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:33,890
They seem pretty calm
about it.

762
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,492
Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

763
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,728
Wormsign north
and east of you.

764
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,830
3.7 kilometers.

765
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,432
Delta Ajax niner,

766
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,333
this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.

767
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,004
Stand by for contact fix.

768
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,110
Worm is on intercept course
to your position.

769
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,778
Contact in five minutes.

770
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,680
So, what happens now?

771
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:00,283
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

772
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,518
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

773
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,220
Calling
carryall Alpha Zero.

774
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,122
Ready for docking sequence.

775
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,691
Contact five minutes. Over.

776
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,198
Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?

777
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,903
There it is.

778
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,381
This is carryall Alpha Zero

779
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,741
to Delta Ajax niner.

780
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,876
Approaching from your east.

781
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,812
Correcting altitude and
preparing docking equipment.

782
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:33,416
Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

783
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:36,953
T-5.

784
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:38,488
Copy that.

785
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,399
Prepare
to be airborne in 30 seconds.

786
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,725
Docking sequence
initiated. Brace yourselves.

787
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,131
Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.

788
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,665
What is going on?

789
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,768
It's one of
the anchors. It's dead.

790
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,137
Shit.

791
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,272
Carryall
unable to receive.

792
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,241
Unable to lift
without that anchor.

793
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:00,009
All call! All call!

794
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,079
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!

795
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:05,114
Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.

796
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,649
Hydraulics are dead.

797
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,317
We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.

798
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,561
Contact in four minutes.

799
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,585
Try it again!

800
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,418
How many men on that crawler?

801
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,488
Crew of 21.

802
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:13,632
Our ships
can take six each.

803
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,824
That's still three short.

804
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:16,592
We'll find a way.

805
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:31,140
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

806
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,844
We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

807
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,946
We'll set down on the west.

808
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,225
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

809
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,360
Yes, Gurney,

810
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:52,805
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

811
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,363
Yes, sire.

812
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,108
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

813
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,200
Guide them in.

814
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,501
Delta Ajax niner,

815
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,070
put seven men each
in my ships now.

816
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,430
Contact in two minutes.

817
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:06,369
Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.

818
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,039
Where are they?

819
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,141
Sir,
there's protocol for a reason.

820
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,944
If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.

821
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,646
Besides, we've got
a full load of spice.

822
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,781
- We can't just leave it.
- Damn the spice!

823
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,484
I want every man
off that crawler now!

824
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:36,565
Hey!

825
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:37,733
Hey!

826
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,336
Seven over here,
seven over there.

827
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,674
Go! Go! Go!

828
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,591
Kwisatz Haderach.

829
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:19,208
Kwisatz Haderach awakes.

830
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,052
Hurry! Get on!

831
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:39,829
It's here!

832
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:43,833
Paul!

833
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,536
Paul!

834
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:54,810
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

835
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,046
Get up!

836
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,682
Let's go!

837
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,385
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

838
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,719
Run!

839
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:30,446
Hey!

840
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,400
Bless the Maker and His Water.

841
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,702
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

842
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:56,705
May His passage
cleanse the world

843
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:59,275
and keep the world
for His people.

844
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,500
Hey!

845
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,635
- You cannot take such risks.
- Yes, sir.

846
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,003
You have responsibilities.

847
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,281
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

848
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,306
Go.

849
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,441
Dr. Kynes.

850
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,112
You saw it.

851
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,180
With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

852
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,516
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

853
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,518
We've been set up to fail.

854
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,321
That carryall was just old.

855
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,456
The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

856
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,860
You know what will happen

857
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,462
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

858
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,268
I'm not here
to take your part.

859
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:03,372
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

860
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:09,645
Take good care of your family.

861
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,118
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

862
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,571
Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

863
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,707
You seem to be sensitive.

864
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:44,146
You'll be fine.

865
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,883
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

866
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,762
That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

867
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,365
I had a vision.

868
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,603
My eyes were wide open.

869
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:10,606
What did you see?

870
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,814
Kwisatz Haderach.

871
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,950
You can see.

872
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,027
It's confusing.

873
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,662
I thought I saw my death,

874
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,930
only it wasn't.

875
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:45,868
I know a knife is important,
somehow.

876
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,172
Someone will hand me a blade,

877
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,976
but I don't know who,
or when, or where.

878
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:59,048
Some things, though,
are crystal clear.

879
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,482
I can feel it.

880
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,722
I know you're pregnant.

881
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,630
You can't know that.

882
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,366
I barely know that.

883
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,468
It's only been a few weeks.

884
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:11,896
Atreides legions

885
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,256
are the finest
in the Imperium.

886
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,725
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

887
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,635
Just so.

888
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,204
Three battalions.

889
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,305
As agreed.

890
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,015
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

891
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,017
No.

892
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,519
Don't think I want to know.

893
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,664
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

894
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,523
he hasn't been the same.

895
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,493
He's distracted.

896
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,531
Jessica, you gave me a son.

897
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,999
And from the moment
he was born,

898
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,968
I never questioned you.

899
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,504
I trusted you completely.

900
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,773
Even when
you walked in shadows.

901
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,876
Now I'm asking you
this one thing.

902
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,681
If anything happens...

903
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,150
will you protect our son?

904
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,386
With my life.

905
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,889
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

906
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,162
Will you protect Paul?

907
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,736
Why are you
having these thoughts?

908
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,745
Leto, this is not you.

909
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,753
I thought we'd have more time.

910
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,341
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

911
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,343
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

912
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,054
You need to sleep.

913
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,257
No.

914
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,625
Not like that.

915
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,143
I should have married you.

916
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,156
Hawat. Security.

917
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,893
Security.

918
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:49,458
Sir. Sir.

919
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,127
The shield's come down.

920
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,971
God in heaven.

921
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:06,041
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

922
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:51,820
Go! Go! Go!

923
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:55,717
With me! With me!

924
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,780
Atreides!

925
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,048
Atreides!

926
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,391
- Sardaukar!
- Sardaukar!

927
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,438
I'm sorry, my lord.

928
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,244
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

929
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,781
Why?

930
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:35,684
I had no choice.

931
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:39,621
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

932
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,257
They take her apart
like a doll.

933
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,360
I will buy her freedom.

934
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,028
And you are the price.

935
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:53,435
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

936
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,837
And you

937
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:57,806
will kill a man for me.

938
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:05,714
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

939
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:10,719
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

940
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:15,056
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

941
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,859
It will be your last breath.

942
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,295
But if you choose
your moment well,

943
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,865
it will also be the Baron's.

944
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:58,660
Paul.

945
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,244
To hell, dogs!

946
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,643
I've never had a highborn.

947
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:05,346
You?

948
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,515
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

949
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:11,419
She's highborn enough for me.

950
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:13,755
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

951
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,823
And give her a long goodbye.

952
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,692
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

953
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,194
Don't talk.

954
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,041
Remove her gag.

955
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,952
Shut up.

956
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,280
Remove her gag.

957
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:21,422
Kill him.

958
01:29:30,398 --> 01:29:31,678
Set us free.

959
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,381
Stop!

960
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:48,015
Cut the rope.

961
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,186
Give me the knife.

962
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,965
Your pitch was too forced.

963
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,441
It's a fremkit.

964
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,622
They've crippled the ship.

965
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:41,829
Mmm.

966
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:01,549
Ah.

967
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:06,087
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

968
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:27,108
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

969
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,777
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

970
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,013
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

971
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,849
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

972
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,224
My lord Baron.

973
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,793
Dr. Yueh.

974
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:47,562
The traitor.

975
01:32:48,763 --> 01:32:49,897
What do you want?

976
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,301
I jammed their comms

977
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,403
and lowered their shields.

978
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:56,737
Hmm.

979
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:59,073
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

980
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,642
The bargain
to the letter.

981
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:04,245
And what was I to do for you?

982
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,480
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

983
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,483
Yes.

984
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:45,586
I said I'd set her free.

985
01:33:45,653 --> 01:33:47,488
That you could join her.

986
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,527
So, join her.

987
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:04,672
What do you think is next?

988
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,645
It's a thumper.

989
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,313
No stillsuits.

990
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,315
The one thing
we actually need.

991
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:22,990
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

992
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:25,860
But no more.

993
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:31,565
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

994
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,535
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

995
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,408
And your bloodline
ends forever.

996
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:54,655
What did you say?

997
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,167
Here I am...

998
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:09,236
here I remain.

999
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:53,674
Kynes!

1000
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:56,710
It's not safe for you here.

1001
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,121
Will you tell
the Great Houses

1002
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,625
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1003
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:02,283
How the best of them
were murdered?

1004
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:05,019
I am commanded to say nothing.

1005
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:07,688
To see nothing.

1006
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:11,892
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

1007
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:02,509
There's spice
in the tent.

1008
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,098
That's the future.
It's coming.

1009
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:47,848
Holy war
spreading across the universe

1010
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:49,216
like unquenchable fire.

1011
01:40:02,162 --> 01:40:05,065
Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1012
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,235
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

1013
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:19,713
Somebody help me, please.

1014
01:40:20,414 --> 01:40:21,582
Paul.

1015
01:40:23,884 --> 01:40:25,586
It's coming.

1016
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,087
I see a holy war spreading

1017
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:29,089
across the universe
like unquenchable fire.

1018
01:40:29,189 --> 01:40:32,192
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1019
01:40:32,259 --> 01:40:33,427
in my father's name.

1020
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:34,527
Paul.

1021
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:36,196
Fanatical legions worshipping

1022
01:40:36,263 --> 01:40:38,432
at the shrine
of my father's skull.

1023
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,735
A war in my name!

1024
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:43,670
Everyone's shouting my name!

1025
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:44,738
Paul.

1026
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:50,511
Paul Atreides.

1027
01:40:50,577 --> 01:40:53,547
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1028
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:57,117
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1029
01:40:57,217 --> 01:41:00,020
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1030
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:01,327
Get off me!

1031
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,858
You did this to me!

1032
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:07,628
You Bene Gesserit
made me a freak!

1033
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:35,055
My father is dead.

1034
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:13,026
Someone's near.

1035
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,462
You need to drink.

1036
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,333
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1037
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,942
Sweat and tears.

1038
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:34,314
All right,
let's get out of here.

1039
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,289
That's Duncan.

1040
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,631
Duncan.

1041
01:43:59,266 --> 01:44:00,467
My lady.

1042
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:01,969
Paul.

1043
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,438
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1044
01:44:04,538 --> 01:44:05,739
We know.

1045
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:08,976
My lord Duke.

1046
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:23,757
Here.

1047
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:27,327
Drink this.

1048
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,970
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1049
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:38,505
on the planet at once.

1050
01:44:38,605 --> 01:44:40,741
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1051
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:42,843
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1052
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:45,479
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1053
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:48,248
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1054
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:49,683
you know it.

1055
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:54,521
So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1056
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,758
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1057
01:44:57,824 --> 01:44:59,860
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1058
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,928
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1059
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:24,117
Storm's coming.

1060
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,233
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1061
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:41,468
We'll be safe here.

1062
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,238
Do you know
what this place is?

1063
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,741
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1064
01:45:51,144 --> 01:45:52,979
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1065
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:55,482
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1066
01:45:58,485 --> 01:46:01,088
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1067
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:02,322
The work had begun,

1068
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:04,057
but then the spice
was discovered.

1069
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:07,160
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1070
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:08,428
Tanat,

1071
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:10,173
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1072
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:11,431
Yes, Liet.

1073
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:13,009
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1074
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,501
Of course, Liet.

1075
01:46:16,837 --> 01:46:18,739
Who are you to the Fremen?

1076
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:10,566
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1077
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:12,159
Dr. Kynes?

1078
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:15,662
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1079
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:17,831
The Sardaukar coming

1080
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,633
and picking them off
one by one.

1081
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,237
Only together
can they stand a chance

1082
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:25,806
against the Imperium.

1083
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:30,010
Would you bear witness?

1084
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,246
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1085
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:36,249
If they believe me,

1086
01:47:36,316 --> 01:47:38,018
there would be general warfare

1087
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:40,320
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1088
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:41,988
Chaos

1089
01:47:42,088 --> 01:47:43,523
across the Imperium.

1090
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:45,025
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1091
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,594
with an alternative to chaos.

1092
01:47:47,661 --> 01:47:49,596
The Emperor has no sons.

1093
01:47:49,663 --> 01:47:51,665
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1094
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:54,534
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1095
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:56,369
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1096
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,138
He brought you here
to kill you.

1097
01:47:58,205 --> 01:48:00,707
What don't you understand?

1098
01:48:00,807 --> 01:48:03,977
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1099
01:48:08,181 --> 01:48:10,951
The Fremen speak
of the Lisan al-Gaib.

1100
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:13,787
Careful.

1101
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,054
The Voice from the Outer World

1102
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:17,290
who will lead them
to paradise.

1103
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:19,826
Superstition.

1104
01:48:24,631 --> 01:48:26,366
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1105
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:27,734
and lost him in battle.

1106
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:34,674
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1107
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:41,815
I've seen your dream.

1108
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:47,153
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1109
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:49,155
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1110
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:50,757
with a wave of my hand.

1111
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:47,607
Sardaukar!

1112
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:51,945
No! Duncan!

1113
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:53,279
Paul, no!

1114
01:50:53,346 --> 01:50:54,946
- Duncan, no!
- No!

1115
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:57,335
- No!
- Paul, no!

1116
01:50:58,318 --> 01:50:59,619
Duncan, no!

1117
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:02,155
- He's locked the door.
- Duncan! No!

1118
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:53,106
He's gone.

1119
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:54,274
Duncan!

1120
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:55,942
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1121
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:05,952
Paul, go! Paul!

1122
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:26,539
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1123
01:52:57,904 --> 01:52:59,572
Follow the light.

1124
01:52:59,639 --> 01:53:01,841
You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1125
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:03,810
That storm out there
is your best shot.

1126
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:06,479
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1127
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,683
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1128
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:12,018
Are you not coming with us?

1129
01:53:12,118 --> 01:53:13,319
It only seats two.

1130
01:53:13,419 --> 01:53:15,121
I'll go to the next station

1131
01:53:15,188 --> 01:53:16,923
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1132
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:18,291
How?

1133
01:53:19,025 --> 01:53:20,960
I'm Fremen.

1134
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:23,263
The desert's my home.

1135
01:53:23,329 --> 01:53:24,430
Good luck.

1136
01:53:24,497 --> 01:53:25,698
Good luck.

1137
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:09,195
I serve only one master.

1138
01:56:09,295 --> 01:56:12,632
His name is Shai-Hulud.

1139
01:56:57,677 --> 01:56:59,245
There are jet flares
behind us.

1140
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:35,014
Paul. We're not high enough!

1141
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:09,082
I must not fear.

1142
01:58:09,148 --> 01:58:10,817
Fear is the mind-killer.

1143
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:14,654
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1144
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:23,229
See the friend.

1145
01:58:26,999 --> 01:58:29,902
See the friend.

1146
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:35,408
The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...

1147
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:40,980
but a reality to experience.

1148
01:58:44,283 --> 01:58:46,519
A process
that cannot be understood

1149
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:48,855
by stopping it.

1150
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:51,357
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1151
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:54,827
We must join it.

1152
01:58:54,927 --> 01:58:56,696
We must flow with it.

1153
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:58,431
Let go.

1154
01:58:58,498 --> 01:59:00,500
Let go.

1155
01:59:47,346 --> 01:59:51,484
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1156
01:59:52,985 --> 01:59:55,555
Winds at 800 kilometers
an hour.

1157
02:00:00,226 --> 02:00:02,528
Nothing survives such a storm.

1158
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:04,030
They're dead.

1159
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:07,266
It's a certainty.

1160
02:00:14,273 --> 02:00:16,576
So, it's done. Finally.

1161
02:00:18,711 --> 02:00:20,546
Send word to Giedi Prime

1162
02:00:20,613 --> 02:00:23,449
to begin selling
our spice reserves.

1163
02:00:24,283 --> 02:00:26,385
But slowly.

1164
02:00:26,452 --> 02:00:29,121
We don't want
the price to fall.

1165
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:30,723
You have no idea
how much it cost me

1166
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:33,292
to bring such a force
to bear here.

1167
02:00:33,392 --> 02:00:36,262
Now I only have
one requirement.

1168
02:00:36,362 --> 02:00:37,463
Income.

1169
02:00:38,297 --> 02:00:40,099
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1170
02:00:40,866 --> 02:00:42,301
Squeeze hard.

1171
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,769
Yes, Uncle.

1172
02:00:45,371 --> 02:00:46,472
And the Fremen?

1173
02:00:47,607 --> 02:00:49,041
Kill them all.

1174
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:14,066
We're above
5,000 meters.

1175
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:53,766
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1176
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:48,781
And breathe through this.

1177
02:05:18,978 --> 02:05:21,247
Now
we have to find the Fremen.

1178
02:05:22,815 --> 02:05:24,149
Are you good?

1179
02:05:24,216 --> 02:05:25,584
Yeah.

1180
02:06:32,451 --> 02:06:34,219
Paul...

1181
02:06:40,759 --> 02:06:44,597
Don't be frightened.

1182
02:06:44,663 --> 02:06:47,900
Even a little
desert mouse can survive.

1183
02:06:48,934 --> 02:06:52,104
Don't be frightened.

1184
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:54,006
You'll need
to face your fears.

1185
02:06:54,106 --> 02:06:55,674
A friend...

1186
02:06:55,774 --> 02:06:58,911
A friend will help you.

1187
02:07:00,279 --> 02:07:02,114
Follow the friend.

1188
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:06,285
You have much to learn.

1189
02:07:08,487 --> 02:07:11,290
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1190
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:16,195
Come with me.

1191
02:07:43,822 --> 02:07:47,559
The sietch
where Duncan lived

1192
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,828
is somewhere off that way.

1193
02:07:51,997 --> 02:07:55,000
I can see
greenery over there.

1194
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:56,235
There.

1195
02:07:56,335 --> 02:07:58,337
That means
Fremen live there.

1196
02:08:02,675 --> 02:08:04,810
We'll cross after dark.

1197
02:08:04,877 --> 02:08:06,879
That's how the Fremen do it.

1198
02:08:09,848 --> 02:08:12,351
We're about to enter
worm territory.

1199
02:08:12,418 --> 02:08:14,253
We can't walk
like regular humans.

1200
02:08:14,353 --> 02:08:15,754
If we do, we're dead.

1201
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:17,856
We'll have to walk
like the Fremen do.

1202
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:19,491
It's called a sandwalk.

1203
02:08:19,558 --> 02:08:22,227
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

1204
02:08:22,327 --> 02:08:23,729
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1205
02:08:23,829 --> 02:08:25,364
Okay. Follow me.

1206
02:08:25,431 --> 02:08:27,199
Do the same moves.

1207
02:08:40,379 --> 02:08:42,014
I think this is
the right direction.

1208
02:10:04,596 --> 02:10:05,664
It's close by.

1209
02:10:06,532 --> 02:10:08,467
Let's get out of here.

1210
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:12,171
Wait.

1211
02:10:12,271 --> 02:10:14,139
It's drum sand.

1212
02:10:18,777 --> 02:10:20,712
run.

1213
02:10:26,652 --> 02:10:28,353
Go! Go!

1214
02:11:40,459 --> 02:11:41,593
It's a thumper.

1215
02:11:46,899 --> 02:11:48,901
Someone set off a thumper.

1216
02:12:03,448 --> 02:12:05,717
Paul! Run!

1217
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:21,733
How big are they?

1218
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:23,001
That was insane.

1219
02:12:27,739 --> 02:12:29,274
Someone called it.

1220
02:13:01,206 --> 02:13:03,775
Do not run.

1221
02:13:03,842 --> 02:13:06,478
You will only waste
your body's water.

1222
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:08,513
Hold.

1223
02:13:16,188 --> 02:13:17,154
Stilgar.

1224
02:13:17,155 --> 02:13:18,725
Hey!

1225
02:13:18,824 --> 02:13:20,058
You know me. I was there

1226
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:21,893
when you came
to my father's Council.

1227
02:13:21,994 --> 02:13:22,994
Oh.

1228
02:13:23,028 --> 02:13:25,063
This is the Duke's son.

1229
02:13:25,163 --> 02:13:26,798
Why are you waiting?

1230
02:13:26,865 --> 02:13:28,734
We need their water.

1231
02:13:28,834 --> 02:13:31,069
This is the boy
I told you about.

1232
02:13:31,169 --> 02:13:32,404
We can't touch him.

1233
02:13:36,808 --> 02:13:38,219
They are weaklings.

1234
02:13:38,243 --> 02:13:40,012
Jamis.

1235
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:41,980
That was a brave crossing
they made

1236
02:13:42,047 --> 02:13:44,916
in the path of Shai-Hulud.

1237
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:48,153
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1238
02:13:49,187 --> 02:13:50,889
Nor did his father.

1239
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:53,592
My thumper
saved his life.

1240
02:13:53,692 --> 02:13:56,161
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1241
02:13:56,228 --> 02:13:57,929
He's not The One.

1242
02:14:00,699 --> 02:14:02,367
We have powerful friends.

1243
02:14:02,434 --> 02:14:05,604
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

1244
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:06,938
you will be well rewarded.

1245
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:09,841
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1246
02:14:09,908 --> 02:14:11,443
in your flesh?

1247
02:14:14,246 --> 02:14:16,281
Hmm...

1248
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:18,016
The boy is young.

1249
02:14:18,083 --> 02:14:20,285
He can learn our ways.

1250
02:14:20,385 --> 02:14:23,021
He may have sanctuary.

1251
02:14:23,088 --> 02:14:25,424
But the woman is untrained...

1252
02:14:28,093 --> 02:14:29,594
and too old to learn.

1253
02:15:00,959 --> 02:15:03,095
back, you dogs.

1254
02:15:04,729 --> 02:15:06,932
She'll cut my throat.

1255
02:15:11,903 --> 02:15:14,406
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1256
02:15:14,473 --> 02:15:16,141
And a fighter?

1257
02:15:16,241 --> 02:15:18,410
Conversation ran short.

1258
02:15:18,477 --> 02:15:20,679
Peace, woman.

1259
02:15:20,779 --> 02:15:22,114
Peace.

1260
02:15:22,914 --> 02:15:24,449
I judged hastily.

1261
02:16:03,655 --> 02:16:06,057
I would not
have let you hurt my friends.

1262
02:16:31,349 --> 02:16:33,919
They say you're the Mahdi.

1263
02:16:34,019 --> 02:16:35,854
But you look
like a little boy.

1264
02:16:37,355 --> 02:16:38,823
You chose the hardest way up.

1265
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:40,225
Follow me.

1266
02:16:47,699 --> 02:16:49,267
Give it to me.

1267
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:57,909
You will have
your own maula pistol

1268
02:16:58,009 --> 02:16:59,911
when you've earned it.

1269
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:01,046
Give it to me.

1270
02:17:06,785 --> 02:17:08,920
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1271
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:11,623
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1272
02:17:11,723 --> 02:17:13,124
I will not have them.

1273
02:17:20,065 --> 02:17:21,466
Jamis,

1274
02:17:21,566 --> 02:17:23,902
I have spoken. Be still.

1275
02:17:23,969 --> 02:17:25,570
You talk like a leader.

1276
02:17:26,571 --> 02:17:28,440
But the strongest leads.

1277
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:31,543
She bested you.

1278
02:17:32,944 --> 02:17:35,246
I invoke the amtal.

1279
02:17:35,313 --> 02:17:37,749
You may not challenge
a Sayyadina.

1280
02:17:37,816 --> 02:17:39,317
Then who will fight
in her name?

1281
02:17:39,417 --> 02:17:42,153
Jamis, don't do this.

1282
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:44,322
Don't. The night is fading.

1283
02:17:44,422 --> 02:17:47,325
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1284
02:17:47,425 --> 02:17:49,461
Where is her champion?

1285
02:18:00,305 --> 02:18:02,307
I accept her champion.

1286
02:18:34,472 --> 02:18:38,376
Paul Atreides
must die...

1287
02:18:40,145 --> 02:18:44,849
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

1288
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:51,222
Don't be frightened.

1289
02:18:51,323 --> 02:18:52,891
Don't resist.

1290
02:18:58,963 --> 02:19:00,899
When you take a life,

1291
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:03,968
you take your own.

1292
02:19:35,734 --> 02:19:38,203
I don't believe
you're the Lisan al-Gaib.

1293
02:19:39,704 --> 02:19:41,740
But I want you
to die with honor.

1294
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:56,054
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1295
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:01,693
It's made
from a tooth of Shai-Hulud.

1296
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,461
The great sandworm.

1297
02:20:05,096 --> 02:20:07,899
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1298
02:20:12,203 --> 02:20:14,572
Where is the Outworlder?

1299
02:20:18,910 --> 02:20:20,812
Jamis is a good fighter.

1300
02:20:21,780 --> 02:20:23,448
He won't let you suffer.

1301
02:20:24,916 --> 02:20:26,551
Chani...

1302
02:20:29,654 --> 02:20:30,722
Um...

1303
02:20:38,763 --> 02:20:39,964
Never mind.

1304
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:37,489
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1305
02:21:45,296 --> 02:21:47,232
You should welcome my blade.

1306
02:21:50,735 --> 02:21:52,504
This world will kill you.

1307
02:21:55,874 --> 02:21:57,408
Quicker this way.

1308
02:22:37,048 --> 02:22:38,683
Do you yield?

1309
02:22:40,919 --> 02:22:42,863
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1310
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:45,822
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1311
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:47,559
Only death is the test of it.

1312
02:22:55,967 --> 02:22:57,902
- Is he toying with him?
- No.

1313
02:22:59,237 --> 02:23:00,905
Paul has never killed a man.

1314
02:23:11,649 --> 02:23:16,087
Kwisatz Haderach.

1315
02:23:19,123 --> 02:23:22,160
Kwisatz Haderach.

1316
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,130
Climb up. Rise.

1317
02:25:18,543 --> 02:25:20,445
You're one of us now.

1318
02:25:20,545 --> 02:25:22,380
A life for a life.

1319
02:25:22,447 --> 02:25:24,515
Come with us to Sietch Tabr.

1320
02:25:24,582 --> 02:25:25,616
No.

1321
02:25:25,717 --> 02:25:27,251
Paul needs to get off-world.

1322
02:25:27,351 --> 02:25:29,420
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1323
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:30,755
you have ships.

1324
02:25:30,855 --> 02:25:32,957
- No.
- You have...

1325
02:25:33,057 --> 02:25:35,126
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1326
02:25:36,561 --> 02:25:38,296
And my father came,

1327
02:25:39,230 --> 02:25:41,532
not for spice,

1328
02:25:41,599 --> 02:25:43,901
not for the riches,

1329
02:25:43,968 --> 02:25:46,104
but for the strength
of your people.

1330
02:25:49,107 --> 02:25:51,209
My road leads into the desert.

1331
02:25:53,878 --> 02:25:55,246
I can see it.

1332
02:25:57,749 --> 02:25:59,383
If you'll have us,

1333
02:26:00,284 --> 02:26:01,886
we will come.

1334
02:26:50,501 --> 02:26:52,003
Desert power.

1335
02:26:53,304 --> 02:26:55,006
This is only the beginning.
