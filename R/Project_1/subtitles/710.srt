1
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,628
I just had the strangest dream.

2
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,669
It's Friday.

3
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,178
We're at the hospital.

4
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,808
But it's not a hospital,
it's a forest of sorts.

5
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:56,561
And I know that because
right next to you there's a bear.

6
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,695
A grizzly, 
cooling his feet in a stream.

7
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:06,199
And all of a sudden,
you begin to deliver...

8
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,532
...and I can't get to you.

9
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,493
But the bear can.

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,913
And next thing I know...

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:20,172
...he is holding our beautiful baby boy.

12
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,293
And here's where it gets odd. Uh ....

13
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,720
He chews the cord.

14
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,341
But, strangely, I'm okay with it.

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,685
That's gotta be a good sign.

16
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,487
Theodore. Loved it.

17
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:48,401
But remember that article I told you about?
Naming kids after famous people?

18
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:53,118
I don't want Teddy to think he's a failure
if he doesn't wind up on Mount Rushmore.

19
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,703
This was tough, because it's mythological.
Round Table, the whole deal.

20
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,837
But "The Name Game." Remember that?

21
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,088
"The Name Game"?

22
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,716
"Art-Art-bo-Bart, Banana-Fauna-fo-Fart."

23
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,127
Brings us to Casey.

24
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,761
This whole next slew of names:

25
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,469
Casey, Jordan, Dylan, Drew, Taylor,
Tyler and probably mostly Skylar...

26
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,760
...are all names that
could be girls' names.

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,519
Why don't we just out to the chase
and call him Cindy?

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,814
Yeah, Atlanta.
Trying to get out of this place.

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,774
- Denver's where it's at, man.
- Mm-hm.

30
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,190
They got the whole underground
government conspiracy thing going on.

31
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,984
- That so?
- I'm hearing a lot of chatter...

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,533
- ...on the message boards.
- Gotcha. I should grab this.

33
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,413
- Sorry. Hey, honey.
- Hey, sweetie.

34
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,745
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

35
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,912
I'm about halfway through it.
I thought I'd take a little break.

36
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,924
Ha, ha. I didn't want you to think I was
arbitrarily dismissing those names.

37
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,550
You considered them carefully.

38
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,585
It's just such a big decision, you know?

39
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,756
I know.
Clearly, you're taking it very seriously.

40
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,765
More importantly,
what are you wearing?

41
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,096
Armani Exchange.

42
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,228
I'm talking to my--
No, no, that's just the driver, baby.

43
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,266
Okay, listen, I'm about to be dropped off.
I should go.

44
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,607
- I love you, can't wait to see you.
- I love you too. Safe flying.

45
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,361
- Here you go.
- Perfect.

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,488
Yep.

47
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,450
What in the eff?

48
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,536
- Goddamn it!
- We done knocked it right off.

49
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,293
Hey, man! You just hit my car!

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,125
- You just knocked my door off, man.
- Sorry about that.

51
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,130
First things first,
is everybody okay?

52
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,758
I'm in a Town Car!
Don't you know airport protocol?

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,420
Town Cars have the right of way always!

54
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,650
That right there is some serious damage.

55
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,942
That ain't shit!

56
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,363
My brother-in-law
is gonna kill me. I'm through!

57
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,826
You okay?

58
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,991
Sorry about my friend.
He's been drinking.

59
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,661
You smell boozy too.
Drinking and driving together?

60
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,670
Well, we haven't been drinking.

61
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,834
I mean, we split a six-pack.
of 40s. But ....

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,627
You know what?

63
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,929
My father always had a saying:

64
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,931
When a day starts like this,
it's all uphill from here.

65
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,013
That's actually incorrect.

66
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,929
- My dad used to say it.
- No, it's all downhill from here.

67
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,439
Everybody wants to be up.
Nobody wants to be down.

68
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,852
It's easier as you go down.
He didn't know what he was talking about.

69
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,862
- Hey, Shelby? We good?
- We're cool, man. I'll take care of it.

70
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,773
- Okay.
- Go get them, Hollywood!

71
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,362
Excuse me. Sir?
You mind picking these up?

72
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,530
I can't. You're not supposed to touch
other people's luggage at an airport.

73
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,374
Handle your own baggage.

74
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,883
Bag check!

75
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,142
- This your bag, sir?
- Is there a problem?

76
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,399
- I'm gonna have to Search it real quick, sir.
- Yeah. Feel free.

77
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,277
Mad magazine? That's cute.

78
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,528
That's not mine.

79
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,234
- This is your bag?
- That's not--

80
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,238
Jackpot

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,074
That's definitely not mine.
My bag got switched with this--

82
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,365
- You packed your bag yourself?
- But not that.

83
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:26,252
I've never done drugs in my life.
This is absolutely" This is crazy.

84
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,911
Maybe you a drug mule.

85
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,582
- Do I look like a drug mule?
- I don't know, how do drug mules look?

86
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,921
- You're the expert.
- What, like me?

87
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,757
- Who said that?
- Your eyes.

88
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,219
My eyes said something? Did my mouth?
I don't think you look like a--

89
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,135
Do you mind not tossing it up so much?

90
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,055
Whoo! Funky motherfucker, ain't you?

91
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,515
You are so inappropriate, it's crazy.

92
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,060
I been called a lot of things,
but "inappropriate"'?

93
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,069
That's some fucked-up shit, yo.

94
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,050
Oh, my goodness.

95
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,461
Look at this, Sonny.

96
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,799
Fancy.

97
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,971
Died and gone to heaven.

98
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,793
Are you not aware
that there's a person here?

99
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,252
Sorry.

100
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,500
Well, hello!

101
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,003
How you doing?

102
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,172
What brings you up to first class?

103
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,341
The seat that I procured--

104
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,679
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me.

105
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,312
I was in low class, and my seat belt
didn't work, and they bumped me up.

106
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,518
It's called economy.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,024
Lucky day. Nice to see you.

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,523
Sorry how we met, but, you know ....

109
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,862
Oh, you know what?

110
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,994
- I think we switched our bags at the curb.
- I know we did.

111
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,872
Your bag was confiscated.
It had paraphernalia in it.

112
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,206
Marijuana pipe.

113
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,540
Well, that's a medical apparatus.

114
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,125
- I have glaucoma.
- Sure, you have glaucoma.

115
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,543
Attention, in preparation for takeoff,
please turn off all electronic devices...

116
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,589
...and if you have a laptop, please stow it.
Thank you and enjoy your flight.

117
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,883
They made the announcement.
You should turn that off.

118
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,348
- Yeah, I get it.
- Just turn it off. You know why?

119
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,479
- I'm gonna turn it off.
- They get uneasy...

120
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,063
...because they know terrorists use their
phones to trigger bombs in their luggage.

121
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,568
Shh. Pst, pst, pst.

122
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,400
- That's not the word you want to say.
- "Terrorist" or "bomb"?

123
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,405
- You said both the words.
- I understand.

124
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,444
- I'm trying to tell you that I read--
- Stop trying to tell me and listen.

125
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,113
Don't say words
that put people on edge.

126
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,498
- I'm trying to be informative.
- it's not cool.

127
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,752
Would you and your friend mind
stepping to the front of the plane?

128
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,911
My friend?

129
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,877
I'm sorry, I need you
to come with me, please.

130
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,919
Listen. This clown,
I've never seen before in my life.

131
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,383
That's not true.
We switched bags at curbside.

132
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,594
- That was an accident. And he had--
- Sir!

133
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,600
Federal air marshal.
Please step to the front of the plane.

134
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,056
What? Why?

135
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,596
Drop the device.

136
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,436
- it's not a device, it's a BlackBerry.
- Drop the device!

137
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,771
What are you gonna do, rent-a-cop?
Shoot me--?

138
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,523
it's okay, everyone. He'll be fine.

139
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,111
It's only a rubber bullet.

140
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,909
Good news, Mr. Highman.
They found your bags on the airplane.

141
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,999
- Oh, good.
- Unfortunately, that plane's over Kansas.

142
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,336
- Figures.
- But I do have your cell phone for you.

143
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,966
Now, if you wouldn't mind just signing this.
it's a simple release.

144
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,254
So I don't sue you.

145
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,765
Just saying we acted in accordance
with state law.

146
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,925
- Sure did.
- Good.

147
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,811
If you put your address there,
I'll have your bags shipped.

148
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,476
Let them land at LAX and I'll pick them up
when I get there. When's the next flight?

149
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,816
- In an hour, but you won't be on it.
- Why's that?

150
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,480
You're on the No-Fly list.

151
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,025
- Why?
- It says right here.

152
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,994
- You and your friend.
- Who?

153
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,874
- The gentlemen I just interviewed.
- I've never seen that dipshit before.

154
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,079
- Really?
- Yeah.

155
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,962
- He had nice things to say about you.
- I'm on a No-Fly list? This is ridiculous.

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,337
- Regardless-
- No.

157
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,297
I have a pregnant wife, I have to get back.
This is a huge misunderstanding.

158
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,342
- What am I supposed to do?
- Have you ever seen Forrest Gump?

159
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,672
Yes.

160
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,139
Well, he ran across country,
and he was pretty stupid.

161
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,349
So I have faith in you.

162
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,852
You're free to leave.

163
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,975
What kind of incident?

164
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,018
I'm probably overstating.

165
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,859
It's the manageable kind.
A micro-incident.

166
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,197
But it unfortunately landed me
on a No-Fly list.

167
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,870
What did you do, Peter?
Did you snap at somebody?

168
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,373
Nope. I did not. I was cool,
calm and collected the whole time.

169
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,661
I was completely in my rights.

170
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,545
You get so carried away sometimes.

171
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,046
How are you gonna get home?

172
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,708
I have a plan.
And the plan is sorting itself out.

173
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,468
- But my wallet is traveling.
- What?

174
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,881
The ID's in it, I've been trying
to rent e car, I had the office fax--

175
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,641
But I am exhausting any
and all opportunities to--

176
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,143
Hey! I've been looking all over for you.

177
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,058
- Stay away from me.
- But I found something of yours.

178
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,650
Honey, this might all be solved.
I'll call you right back.

179
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,488
Peter?

180
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,566
You got my stuff?

181
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,699
- I grabbed it before they zip-tied me.
- Rally Monkey?

182
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,280
- You get my wallet?
- I didn't see it.

183
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,698
Where's my bag?

184
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,085
I saw your bag, but I didn't grab it
because my hands were full.

185
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,245
You know, I had this thing in my hand.

186
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,090
- What kind of car did you get?
- I didn't, because I don't have a license...

187
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,219
...because it's in my wallet
that's on the .... Right?

188
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,671
Oh, shoot. What a bummer.

189
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,381
Yeah, bummer.

190
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,300
Thanks for the doll.

191
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,935
Fucking idiot.

192
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,388
Hey, you wanna ride with us?

193
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,600
No, I'm fine.
I'm not really a big dog person.

194
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,189
Look, I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

195
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,401
But I have a really great personality
once you get to know me.

196
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,407
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

197
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,786
I got 90 friends on Facebook.
Twelve pending, but I got 90 friends.

198
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,122
I'll cover expenses.

199
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,375
You can pay me back
when we get to Hollywood.

200
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,251
- L.A.
- Huh?

201
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,209
It's not called Hollywood.
it's Los Angeles.

202
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,628
Yeah, but I'm going to Hollywood.

203
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,252
What's your name?

204
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,632
Peter.

205
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,717
My name's Ethan. Ethan Trembling.

206
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,803
And this little guy...

207
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,805
...this little butterball...

208
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,514
...this is Sonny.

209
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:04,478
And we would be honored
to have you ride with us. Come on.

210
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,567
It'll be fun.

211
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,332
JK. LOL.

212
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,617
HI. "Hop in."

213
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,625
Life's weird, isn't it? Buckle up.

214
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,723
- You have any brothers or sisters?
- No.

215
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,135
- You have a dog?
- Nope.

216
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,848
What's your favorite color?

217
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,858
- Blue.
- That's so cool. Mine's green.

218
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,690
Wow.

219
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,527
- Do you like hot dogs?
- Yes, I do.

220
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,488
I'm more of a corn-dog man, myself.

221
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,369
I once ate a foot-long corn dog
on a nude beach.

222
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,950
I'll never do that again.

223
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,201
- At what age did you lose your virginity?
- I'm not gonna discuss that.

224
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,790
- I was 9 years old.
- Boy.

225
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,876
Great gal. Great gal.

226
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,381
Sheila Pimples.

227
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,293
I'm getting a headache,
not because of you.

228
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,507
It's just, I'm under a lot of pressure.

229
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,468
My wife and I are having a baby.

230
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,349
- On Friday. That's who the monkey's for.
- Oh, really?

231
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,055
- Yep. C-section.
- That's sweet.

232
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:27,316
- So if we could just .... Thanks.
- I understand. God, I totally understand.

233
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,477
I was supposed to meet
a big time agent in Hollywood.

234
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,520
Luckily, he postponed.

235
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,314
- So you're an actor.
- Yep.

236
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,323
Yep. You know what?

237
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,656
In fact, I wouldn't mind having
a fresh pair of eyes--

238
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,071
Hey, hey, hey.

239
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,749
My apologies. Look at this.

240
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,036
- Okay. If you'd just look at the road.
- I got it.

241
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,079
- Oh, your headshots.
- Headshots.

242
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,090
This one, this is a laid-back guy
with a Hawaiian shirt...

243
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,592
...but he packs a piece.

244
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,094
- Interesting.
- Yep.

245
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,963
This one was my father's favorite.

246
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,762
He says it really showed my spirit.

247
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,096
And I agree with him.

248
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,386
What's that, a--'?

249
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,727
That's a gang member,
a construction worker, and ....

250
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,267
And a nerd. A professor.

251
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,686
No. I'm Malcolm X.

252
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,205
He thinks he's human. So stupid.

253
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,327
What brought you to Atlanta?
Business or pleasure?

254
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,791
- Business.
- Business.

255
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,130
What kind of business?

256
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,129
Architecture.

257
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,795
- How'd you get into architecture?
- College. Anything else?

258
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,804
- Because I'm trying to--
- I'm sorry.

259
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,467
We're gonna be traveling.
It wouldn't hurt to get to know each other.

260
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,561
Okay.

261
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,848
Ethan, what brought you to Atlanta?
Business or pleasure?

262
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,311
My daddy died.

263
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,317
I went to Atlanta to go to his funeral.

264
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,320
Gee, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

265
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,232
He was a great guy, man.
That's why I'm heading out West.

266
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,652
He's the one that motivated me
to get on the TV.

267
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,161
TV?
ea h.

268
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,455
Tough business to break into.

269
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,115
So competitive.

270
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,284
I have a friend, he's in that industry.

271
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,204
- Does he work on Two and a Half Men?
- No. He--

272
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:15,794
That's too bad.
Because Two and a Half Men...

273
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,085
...is the reason I wanted
to become an actor.

274
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,049
- Right.
- Especially the second season.

275
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,964
Here's the plan.

276
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,179
We are just outside Birmingham...

277
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,687
...and we got a late start, so we will
only make it just to inside Louisiana.

278
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,314
Early to bed, early to rise.

279
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,568
Long 16- to 18-hour haul,
which will land us in Phoenix, Arizona.

280
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,229
- Eight hours outside of L.A.
- You know what'd be nice?

281
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,148
If we could stop at the Grand Canyon.

282
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,191
We're not going to the Grand Canyon.

283
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,907
That would be easily 120 miles off
our optimum route.

284
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,241
That's too bad.

285
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,866
Daddy would've loved
the Grand Canyon.

286
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,329
Why do you even have this?

287
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,665
Oh, because this is my daddy.

288
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,042
These are his ashes.

289
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,883
Why are your father's ashes
in a coffee can, Ethan?

290
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,211
Because he's dead, Peter.

291
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,052
- I know. I know that part.
- Don't you listen to anything?

292
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,718
I'm just saying,
normal people put remains in an urn.

293
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,519
This is vacuum-sealed.

294
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,181
You broke the seal
when you poured out the coffee.

295
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,897
You poured your father's remains in
and closed it. That didn't reseal it.

296
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,609
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

297
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,072
God. We shouldn't have come here.

298
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
I'm allergic to waffles.

299
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,456
Come on, Sonny. Thank you.

300
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,426
We need to make a brief pit stop
in Birmingham.

301
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,429
Actually, our next stop is Shreveport.
That's where we rest.

302
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,091
- it's 10 minutes away.
- Let's see if we can make it.

303
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,136
Why you making a pit stop in Birmingham?
We gotta make time.

304
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,270
I left my glaucoma medication
on the plane.

305
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,272
Wait, wait, wait. Your what?

306
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,933
You mean your weed?

307
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,477
- it's medical marijuana, Peter.
- No, it's weed.

308
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,988
- Why do you make everything so dark?
- it's weed.

309
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm saying I really don't want to stop
and buy drugs. Is that okay?

310
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,779
I didn't want to play this card,
certainly not this early.

311
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,789
But guess what. Guess who's got
the Subaru Impreza. Me.

312
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,666
Guess who's got all the money. Me.

313
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,293
Guess who's got
a winning personality. Me.

314
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,251
What do you have?
You have a nice hairline, fine.

315
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,790
You have a strong jaw, fine.

316
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,925
But I gotta tell you something, mister.

317
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,462
Your personality needs some work.

318
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,005
My God.

319
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,594
Now, do you want a ride
to California or not?

320
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,180
- Yes, please.
- Good. Hold Dad.

321
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,971
- Dad!
- I'm sorry. I got it. I got it, I got it.

322
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,271
Okay. God Almighty, holy moly.
It's like I'm traveling with a Child.

323
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,110
- Did you use the restroom?
- I need to take a pee-pee.

324
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,620
- Peter?
- Crisis averted, I'm driving.

325
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,496
- Driving how?
- Let me talk to her.

326
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,159
With a guy- Please don't.
With a guy that I met in a rent-a-car.

327
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,999
You're gonna drive 2000 miles
with a guy you just met?

328
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,287
Say hi to--

329
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,879
Sarah? Hi, this is Ethan Tremblay.
I'm riding with Peter. How are you?

330
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,215
I'm fine. How are you?

331
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:10,007
Good, good. I wanted to let you know
I have your package, and he is A-okay.

332
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,345
And I will have him
delivered by Thursday.

333
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,681
Thank you so much.

334
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,973
Hey, Sarah? One other thing.
Do you have a hairdresser out West?

335
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,642
I got this killer perm,
and it needs major upkeep.

336
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,231
I'm sorry, did you say
that you have a perm?

337
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,192
Yeah, a perm. Like a permanent.

338
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,027
- it's heinous.
- Do you mind?

339
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,068
- Can I just talk to my husband, please?
- Yeah. Okay, hold on.

340
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,202
- She wants to talk to you.
- I know.

341
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,580
- So that's what I'm dealing with.
- Oh, my God.

342
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,037
Yep. God bless us all.

343
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,749
- Stop worrying.
- I'm not worried.

344
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,960
She's very legitimate.
I found her on Craigslist.

345
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,295
Who is it?

346
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,505
Fantastic.

347
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,253
Hi. it's Ethan. I called you earlier.

348
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,300
Honestly, like two minutes, okay?
Just buy it and then go.

349
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,514
- Hey.
- Hi.

350
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,724
- That was fast.
- Yeah, we were very close.

351
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,231
I'm Ethan, this is Peter.

352
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,734
- Are you a cop?
- Why? Are you not a licensed pharmacist?

353
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,692
Okay, you just look really official.

354
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,950
And you know if I ask you if you're a cop
and you are a cop, you have to say yes.

355
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,736
That's a myth. That's actually incorrect.
But I'm not.

356
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,702
- No, he's an architect.
- I'm an architect. So ....

357
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,958
- Wait, it's a myth?
- Yeah.

358
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,212
Shit! I did not know that
this whole fucking time.

359
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,215
- That's good news.
- You're fucking scary, is what you are.

360
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,877
- Come in. The pharmacy's in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

361
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:33,389
Hey, Peter, can you watch my kids just for
five minutes, while we hen" You know.

362
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,017
- Real quick.
- Thanks.

363
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,610
Who are you?

364
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,273
I'm Peter.

365
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,738
I'm Alex. This is Patrick.

366
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,247
Great. Alex. Mommy gave you
a boy's name.

367
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,874
What's that supposed to mean?

368
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,243
Alex is also a name for a boy.

369
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,629
So your mom kind of screwed you.

370
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,344
Sorry, my hand slipped.

371
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,640
That one I just got in. it's an Afghan blend
of Wild Widow and AK-47.

372
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,355
You know, I'm not crazy about blends.

373
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,316
I find that the high is a bit shapeless.

374
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,822
A purist. Well, that's cool.

375
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,949
You'd probably love Northern Lights.

376
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:38,830
I mean, this has got great body.
It smokes like a fucking dream.

377
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,663
Oh, that's just Barry.
He's renting a room from me.

378
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,169
Hey, Barry. How you doing? I'm Ethan.

379
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,798
Listen, did you remember to TiVo
Judge Mathis?

380
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,709
Yeah. it's on there,
if you just look at the menu.

381
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:55,130
Nice perm, man. Well done.
Well done on that perm.

382
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,095
Oh, thanks, bro.
It's not a perm, it's natural.

383
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,510
Nobody gets perms anymore.

384
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,687
Wait, wait. Don't tell me. Is that a perm?

385
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,019
Yeah. it's a perm. Yeah.

386
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,650


387
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,228
Oh, my God.
You didn't have your real hair.

388
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,364
- Where do you even get those anymore?
- I know! it's like ....

389
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,699
I was just kidding about--
This isn't a perm.

390
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,489
- Excuse me?
- This isn't a perm. I was joking.

391
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,242
- Oh, my God. Thank God. Because I was--
- Ha, ha!

392
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,661
You got us. You got us both, man.

393
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,876
You know, only, like,
fucking jerk-offs get perms.

394
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,838
- That was good. Very good.
- That was hilarious.

395
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,725
- Where are you from?
- Los Angeles.

396
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,352
- Is that where you're going?
- Mm-hm.

397
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,937
Can you take us with you?

398
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,853
No, but there's an organization
called Child Protective Services.

399
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,942
- What's this?
- it's a tie. You've never seen a tie before?

400
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,610
Why do you wear it?

401
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,195
Because I wear it.

402
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,577
- It looks stupid.
- Well, it's not.

403
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,079
Just take your hands off of me.

404
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,116
Please stop doing that.

405
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,373
Stop. Please stop doing that now.

406
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,083
- Will you please--?
- it's Reggie.

407
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,375
Is that right? Well, maybe Reggie
needs to take a nap.

408
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,595
Hey, quit it. I'm not kidding.

409
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,478
You okay, bubba?

410
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,943
- What?
- Nothing.

411
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,613
"Nothing" is right.

412
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,871
And now, you come to me and you say:

413
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,751
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

414
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:55,629
But you don't even have the decency
to call me the Godfather.

415
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,927
And you come to my house...

416
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,348
...on the day that my daughter
is to be married...

417
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,929
...and you ask me to kill someone.

418
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,345
For money.

419
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,857
But that is not justice.

420
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:20,654
That's amazing.
I had chills, like, that second paragraph.

421
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,695
When the line-- The murder.
That is so fucking good, Ethan.

422
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,206
Thank you. I've been
working on the hand gestures to get it right.

423
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,617
Did you write that yourself?

424
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,660
No. The Mafia wrote it.

425
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,707
Ch, that was so--
It was nice meeting you, anyway.

426
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,750
Play it cool, or I'll thump you again.

427
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,840
Sure, sure. You all set?

428
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,174
Yeah. Good to go.

429
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,510
How were they?
They behave themselves?

430
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,016
Pretty much. Pretty much.

431
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,176
- Ch, good.
- Yeah.

432
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,345
I mean, they're great kids.

433
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,347
We good?

434
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,356
- See you. Good luck.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

435
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,237
Good luck with your acting stuff.

436
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,058
--is judging the character.

437
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,890
When an actor is preparing a scene...

438
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,397
...first thing is read the scene over
many times.

439
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,560
First, before you do any work on it,
let it work on you.

440
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,482
Read the material over and over again.
The entire script, if at all possible.

441
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,901
Hey, Hollywood.

442
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,740
Card's been declined.

443
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,247
- What's that?
- Your card? it's no good.

444
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,908
- Oh, gosh.
- it's okay.

445
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,078
You know what? I bet I tapped it out
when I rented this car.

446
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,588
Great. We'll pay cash.
How much you got?

447
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,918
Sixty bucks.

448
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:03,170
You have 60 bucks entirely?

449
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,804
- Yes.
- How much did you spend on marijuana?

450
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,341
- On your medicine?
- I don't know, around 200 bucks.

451
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,850
- Two hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

452
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,307
Sixty bucks for gas, food,
lodging, everything?

453
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,813
She's the only dealer in town.
She names her price.

454
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:19,227
What were you thinking when you spent
almost all of our money on drugs?

455
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,987
- I don't think in those terms.
- What terms do you think in?

456
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,148
I'm not an accountant.
I'm not even Jewish.

457
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,610
- Are you an adult?
- Of course I'm an adult. I'm 23 years old.

458
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,780
You are the most shot-out
23-year-old I've ever seen.

459
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,916
How have you made it?
How have you not run yourself over?

460
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,580
I've done that.

461
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,462
How have you survived?
That's my question.

462
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,122
- Mostly luck.
- Yeah.

463
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,087
That's what I thought.
Just dumb fucking luck.

464
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,336
- Fuck me.
- Whoa! For heaven's sakes, Peter.

465
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,924
- We're screwed, Ethan.
- How so?

466
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,307
- You spent all our money on weed!
- it's just another speed bump.

467
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:54,016
You know what? I'm gonna call my wife.
She's gonna wire me money. That's it.

468
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,014
She can't. You don't have an ID.

469
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,859
She'll wire it to you.
See? That's an adult solving a problem.

470
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,938
- Let's go.
- I told you I was lucky.

471
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,651
Get in the car.

472
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,488
Hold on one second. I'm gonna go get
a brochure for my scrapbook, okay?

473
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,543
- How do you spell the last name?
- T-R-E-M-B-L-A-Y.

474
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,843
Here we go.
Five hundred dollars. Ethan Tremblay.

475
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,003
I just need to see an ID.

476
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,887
There you go.

477
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,305
Yeah, this doesn't say Tremblay.

478
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,644
It says Ethan Chase.

479
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,728
Oh, jeepers Creepers.
He's right, he's right.

480
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,521
What do you mean, "he's right"?

481
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,860
Ethan Tremblay is my stage name.
I'm an actor.

482
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,697
- Your stage name. What is your real name?
- Ethan Chase.

483
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,863
- It doesn't sound like an actor's name.
- Ethan Chase does.

484
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,202
Ethan Tremblay doesn't
make any goddamn sense.

485
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,333
It sounds like it was made up.

486
00:26:58,492 --> 00:26:59,744
Yeah, I made it up.

487
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,380
Ethan, I know you made it up.
it's your fucking stage name.

488
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,088
Why did you have my wife wire money
to your stage name?

489
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,877
- I wasn't thinking.
- Right.

490
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,592
Just trying to commit to the new name.

491
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,724
Do you guys wanna discuss this,
perhaps out in the parking lot?

492
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,601
One sec. Do you have anything else
with your name on it?

493
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,559
- Yes. Of course. Yes, yes.
- Good.

494
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,894
What was I thinking?

495
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,562
- He has two names.
- That's fantastic.

496
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,821
But one sec.

497
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,532
- What the fuck is this?
- it's an ID.

498
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,367
It's a photo ID.

499
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,497
- No, I can't accept this either.
- Why?

500
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,751
Because it's a picture of yourself.
Anyone could take a picture...

501
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,753
...in a beautiful turtleneck,
put whatever name they want.

502
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,086
But why go to all that trouble
just for 500 bucks?

503
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,217
I don't know why you would,
but you could.

504
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,381
So I get to call my pregnant wife and have
her drive all the way to Western Union.

505
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,051
Start this whole process all over again,
send it to the correct name...

506
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,264
...and we'll be good.

507
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,225
- Absolutely.
- Great.

508
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,106
We'll have to do that tomorrow.
We close in five minutes.

509
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,267
It's 6:35, sir.

510
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,436
What are you, my boss?
You make the hours?

511
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:11,449
I say when we close. I got reservations
at Chili's. I'm meeting my boys.

512
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,076
- You have a reservation at Chili's?
- Mm-hm.

513
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,577
That's actually smart. I mean,
it gets busy on a Wednesday night.

514
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,742
Are you gonna stare at me?

515
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,628
Do your fucking job
until your shift is over, hillbilly.

516
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,414
- Keep dreaming, faggot. No way in hell.
- Oh, really?

517
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,255
Excuse me, Peter. Sir.

518
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:35,802
I'm sorry about my friend. We really just
need the money to get to Los Angeles...

519
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,467
...so he can be there
for the birth of his first child.

520
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,479
That's such a sweet story. You know
where I was when my daughter was born?

521
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,811
- Chili's?
- Iraq.

522
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:49,020
How about I call my sergeant in Fallujah
and tell him your story, see what he thinks?

523
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,860
Aren't you closing?
Is it gonna take a long time?

524
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,696
He's being sarcastic, Ethan,
and also letting us know...

525
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,202
...that he's a "battle-hardened" veteran...

526
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,365
...who did some half-assed tour
and talks about it all the time.

527
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,032
How dare you.

528
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,873
- Smooth move, that.
- You're sick.

529
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,497
You fucked up. Bigtime.

530
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,173
- I fucked up?
- Yeah.

531
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,883
I fucked up bigtime?

532
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,170
You spit on your own window.

533
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,847
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, sport?

534
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,684
What were you saying about
my half-assed tour of duty?

535
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,392
- I'm sorry. I had no idea.
- No idea what?

536
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,056
- I'm handicapable?
- Handicapable.

537
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,976
- How could you know?
- I couldn't know, and I'm sorry.

538
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:33,318
Can I tell you something? Honestly,
it's my fault. I'm just having a bad day.

539
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,732
- You had a bad day?
- Yeah.

540
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,151
It's about to get a whole lot worse.

541
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,490
- Okay, now put that away before you--
- Help!

542
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,163
Oh, I know that shit hurt, huh?

543
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,699
- Ah. Fucking hick.
- Oh, God.

544
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,037
The kid's got moves.

545
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,874
You wanna fuck up my dinner plans,
I'll fuck you up.

546
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,339
I call that little move "the wheelbarrow."

547
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,050
- Peter, get up, get up.
- Come on. Come on.

548
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,057
- Courtesy of Western Union, huh?
- Hold on one second.

549
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,723
- Oh, where you going, huh?
- Call the cops.

550
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,516
Fuck the cops.

551
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,931
Here comes the train.
Choo-Choo!

552
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,571
it's closing time

553
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,232
Time to roll to Chili's

554
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,777
And chow down with my fuckin' boys

555
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,589
You okay, buddy?

556
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,761
Don't call me that. Buddies have each
ether's backs when an assault takes place.

557
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,519
Peter, that man was handicapped.

558
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,932
You can call me Peter. Or Mr. Highman.

559
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:54,194
I'll call you Mr. Chase.
Unless that was a fake ID too.

560
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,283
Why you have a stage name is beyond me.
You're not really an actor.

561
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,321
What does that mean, "really an actor"'?
What is a real actor?

562
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,615
A real actor is someone
who can really act.

563
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,455
Well, go ahead, give me an action to do.
Give me a scene.

564
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,369
- No. I don't want to.
- You should.

565
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,542
Okay. I'm Julia Roberts.

566
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,672
You have terminal cancer.

567
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,754
We're engaged.

568
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,342
Break the news to me.

569
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,047
Julia Roberts...

570
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,558
...as you know, we're engaged.

571
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,807
I have terminal cancer.

572
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,185
Awful.

573
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,225
- What?
- Sorry, that's my feedback.

574
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,394
- I thought that was really good.
- Nope.

575
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,905
I'll give you one more shot.
it's Super Bowl Sunday.

576
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,487
You're a coach with a spotty career.

577
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,199
You're down 31 points.

578
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,580
Bust into the locker room
and fire the guys up.

579
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,536
All or nothing. Action.

580
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,328
- Stupid. That would never be in a movie.
- it's in a movie every two years.

581
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,913
Every two years.

582
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,513
Okay, guys, we need to get out there.

583
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,926
Really need to get going.
Pollard, what are you doing?

584
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,722
You're acting like a girl out there.
What are you, a girl or something?

585
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,059
Jackson, come on, man,
you gotta get yourself together.

586
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:18,946
- What are you, a girl or something?
- Let's up the stakes. Your wife calls.

587
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,356
She wants a divorce.

588
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,859
- The coach's wife?
- The coach you're playing.

589
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,995
His wife calls. She wants a divorce.

590
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,910
Ring-ring.

591
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,451
Hello?

592
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:38,715
Hey, fellas, it's gonna be a minute.
it's my wife. She wants a divorce.

593
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,171
Hey, sweetheart.

594
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,886
What's that?

595
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,305
No, don't--

596
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,433
This is not a good time.

597
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:11,123
Because I lost my dad,
I don't want you to leave me right now.

598
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,464
I don't wanna be left alone.

599
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,423
I miss him so much.

600
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,137
You can't do this.

601
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,128
I got soda. I got water.

602
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,213
Okay. Great.

603
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,631
Thank you.

604
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,260
- Crazy rain.
- Nuts.

605
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,273
I think we're done for today.
We'll sleep in the car.

606
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,317
Okay.

607
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,526
We'll kill it tomorrow. But this is ....

608
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,533
So tell me something about your dad.
What did he do for a living?

609
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,496
He was a toll-booth operator.

610
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,751
Really?

611
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,210
He was a real people person.
He loved his job.

612
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:46,093
He'd come home every night and he'd laugh
about how long his line was.

613
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,846
Because he enjoyed talking to everybody
that went through the toll booth.

614
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,848
Oh.

615
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,598
What about you? Where's your dad?

616
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,478
Uh ....

617
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,190
No idea.

618
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,860
When's the last time you saw him?

619
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,854
1977.

620
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,651
Ooh.

621
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,566
Ouch.

622
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,496
Yep. Came into my room, said,
"Petey, I got an important job for you.

623
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,954
I need you to wake me up,
5:30 tomorrow morning."

624
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,746
And I was ecstatic because
he never asked me to do anything.

625
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:27,964
I didn't even know I existed
in his eyes. So ....

626
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,716
It was just a big deal. I was so excited.

627
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:35,134
I set the alarm clock. I could barely sleep.
I just watched it all night.

628
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,099
When it went off at 5:30,
I snuck into his room...

629
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,140
...I gingerly wake him up.

630
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,897
He smiled at me.

631
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,062
First time I ever saw him...

632
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:54,824
...uh, smile.

633
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,160
But he had his bags packed
by the front door...

634
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,372
...and he picked them up,
put them in the back of his car...

635
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,747
...and drove away.

636
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,878
Last time I ever saw him.

637
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,805
it's so funny.

638
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,104
Oh, my gosh.

639
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,107
My dad would never do that.
He loved me.

640
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,375
What's that sound?

641
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,295
What sound?

642
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,756
Mm.

643
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,966
No, it stopped.

644
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,344
- Okay, it's back.
- That's me. I'm just masturbating.

645
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,057
What? Why?

646
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,972
This is how I go to sleep.

647
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,062
Oh, don't, don't, don't. Come on, dude.

648
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,897
I'm right here next to you.

649
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,857
Just shut your eyes, Peter.

650
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,989
They're closed. The sound.

651
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,320
Just bear with me.

652
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,491
- How long is this gonna take?
- Ugh!

653
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,037
If you keep interrupting me
it's gonna take a little longer...

654
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,327
...but it usually just takes
about 35 minutes.

655
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,040
Is that all?

656
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,179
Your fucking dog's doing it too.

657
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,848
Sonny! Stop!

658
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,516
Sonny, no. Stop.

659
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,443
Good boy.

660
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,085
I

661
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,238
Come here, garbage face. Come here.

662
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,232
Don't even think about it.
Had to be done.

663
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,192
Please. Don't.

664
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,448
Intolerable. Intolerable.

665
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,204
Son of a bitch.

666
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,465
Goddamn it. No.

667
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,349
Great. This is great.

668
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,010
Fuck.

669
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,804
Don't.

670
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,149
Okay.

671
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,070
We are gathered in the presence
of the Lord and all things holy...

672
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,699
...to celebrate the passing of one Mr.--
I don't remember his fucking name.

673
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,862
Chase. Or a.k.a. Tremblay.

674
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:10,333
May he forever reside and dwell
in the sunlight of the spirit.

675
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,995
Amen.

676
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,005
You know, I just wanna offer
an explanation, sir...

677
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,920
...as to why you wound up
on the side of Interstate 20.

678
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,839
It's not your fault. it's your kid.

679
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,260
He's an incredibly difficult person
to travel with.

680
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,270
In fact, I don't know how or why...

681
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,854
...you didn't just strangle him
in the fucking Crib.

682
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,885
Hey, buddy.

683
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,473
Forget something?

684
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,225
No. I got ....

685
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,140
I got coffee.

686
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,438
Dunkin' Donuts.

687
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,977
Thought maybe you left me.

688
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,147
I picked up breakfast
so we can eat on the road, make up time.

689
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,446
- Why'd you leave my stuff out here?
- it's your property.

690
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,409
- That makes sense.
- Yep.

691
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,907
Want me to drive?

692
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,247
- It is your shift.
- Okay. Very good.

693
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,333
I'll grab the other items.

694
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,622
- Okay.
- Okay.

695
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:40,836
Come on, Sonny.

696
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,751
Sonny, come on.

697
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,922
I was thinking, "There's no way
that Peter would have left me here.

698
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,475
We've had our bumps in the road,
but he's not gonna leave me."

699
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:54,433
- Oh, please, no. it's not my car.
- Right.

700
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,643
Yeah. Come on. Get in, Sonny.

701
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,360
You know, my mind works
in mysterious ways.

702
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,022
And I thought, "God, why would
he wanna travel alone, you know?"

703
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,440
You have a nice shower?

704
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,653
- Yes, excellent.
- Great.

705
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,285
You know, rest areas
have the nicest showers.

706
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,697
The nicest showers.

707
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,418
This coffee's hot.

708
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,541
- it's hot coffee.
- Whoo!

709
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,054
- Have we crossed the Mississippi River?
- We're in Texas.

710
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,387
The Mississippi River was the river
we crossed in Mississippi.

711
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,135
That's too bad.

712
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,725
Would have been a great sendoff
for my papa.

713
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:41,860
Put his ashes in the old river. Let the ashes
float down to New Orleans, you know?

714
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,233
Spend Mardi Gras there.

715
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,320
- I'm gonna get some shuteye, okay?
- Nothing he loved more than jazz music...

716
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,493
...and women's titties.

717
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,249
- Did I snore last night?
- Mm-hm.

718
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,044
Sorry. I'm a deep sleeper.
it's a condition.

719
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,548
You know when they say, "That guy
could sleep through an earthquake"?

720
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,674
I've actually slept
through an earthquake.

721
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,887
I also fell asleep during a job interview
at Bank of America.

722
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,174
I didn't sleep last night.
I'm gonna try now.

723
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,717
You should have masturbated...

724
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,682
...because I had a glorious orgasm
and I slept like a baby.

725
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,060
- of a gentle coast

726
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,806
And a sun to maybe dissipate

727
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,520
Shadows of the mess you made

728
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,954
Hey! Get up!

729
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,919
Ethan, wake up! Goddamn it!

730
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,464
Son of a bitch.

731
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:28,587
NO!

732
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,441
I can't feel my arm.

733
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,876
What happened?

734
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,458
I'll see if the rental agreement's in the ....

735
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,680
You know what? I have coverage.

736
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,215
That's good.

737
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,190
- Stay away from me.
- Jeez Louise, are you okay?

738
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,568
Am I okay? Do I look okay?

739
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,820
I have a broken arm, three cracked ribs.

740
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,323
I have seven stitches in my armpit.
Does that answer your question?

741
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,993
No, not okay.

742
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,488
- Peter, I am terribly sorry.
- Are you?

743
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:42,658
Sonny's all banged up. I'm a wreck.
You don't have a scratch.

744
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,497
Doctor said I was in such a deep sleep
I didn't tense up.

745
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,503
- I told you I was a deep sleeper.
- Yeah.

746
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:51,087
Did the doctor say it is not advisable
to fall asleep while driving?

747
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,752
I was just trying to rest my eyes
for a few seconds.

748
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,387
But seriously, next time
try not to tense up. Really.

749
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,383
- One sec.
- Who's that?

750
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,849
My actual friend. He's come to pick me up.
All the way from Dallas.

751
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,855
- Oh, good. Shotgun.
- Nope. Not us.

752
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,857
Just me. We're done.

753
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,360
And by the way,
it's been a fucking pleasure.

754
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,864
But just so my conscience is clear,
let me let you know...

755
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,571
...why you're not coming with us, okay?

756
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:21,533
It's not because you got me kicked off
a plane and shot by an air marshal.

757
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:26,543
Not because you stood by as I had my ass
handed to me by a handicapped hillbilly.

758
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,578
I am certainly not leaving you here...

759
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,590
...because you almost got me killed
during the most important week of my life.

760
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,877
I am leaving you here
for a far more fundamental reason:

761
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,092
I despise who you are at a cellular level.

762
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,758
I've heard that before,
and I'm trying to work on it.

763
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,471
- Great. Now hear this:
- Yes.

764
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,888
Beware. I'm warning you,
don't go to Hollywood.

765
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,399
The streets are not paved with gold.
They are paved with the carcasses...

766
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,402
...of imbeciles like you
who think they're gonna make it.

767
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,108
"Pray you, avoid it."

768
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,115
Did you get that? That was Shakespeare.
Heard of him?

769
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,652
Yes, I've heard of him.
He's a famous pirate.

770
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,820
And by the way, it's Shakesbeard.

771
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,740
Let me give you a little bit
of friendly advice.

772
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:11,876
Nobody who calls themselves "Hollywood"
has ever made it in Hollywood.

773
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,132
That I've never heard before.

774
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,262
Sonny, you will be sorely missed,
you little bat-faced piece of shit.

775
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,726
- I have never...
- Well, get used to it.

776
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,603
...in all of my 23 years!

777
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,860
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What the fuck?

778
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,771
- We're moving out.
- You all right?

779
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,655
- What's going on?
- Thank you so much.

780
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,612
Who's the dude you yelling at?

781
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,494
He's nobody. A guy I was traveling with.
He's trouble.

782
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:44,869
He looks sad as shit.

783
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,705
- And you just spit on his dog.
- I spit on his d-- God, I did.

784
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,873
I was seeing red because he has a way of
getting under your skin. I'm fine. Let's go.

785
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,837
- You wanna leave him here?
- Trust me.

786
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,343
- Pete, how long have I known you?
- Twenty years.

787
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,549
- Twenty years.
- Yep.

788
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,557
Your energy's off. You don't wanna mess
your karma up. You have a child coming.

789
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,515
So whatever you need to do to fix between
you and DeBarge, you need to fix it.

790
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,185
Trust me.

791
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,731
Make it right.

792
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,365
Hollywood, come here.

793
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,664
- You see what I'm working with here?
- Oh, wow.

794
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,338
Okay, I've calmed down a bit.

795
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,545
- You ready to apologize?
- What? Fuck you!

796
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,959
- Wait. Oh, no.
- Let's go.

797
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,254
Pete, Pete, relax.

798
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,675
Fix it.

799
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,182
First of all,
I'm sorry that I spat on Sonny.

800
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,342
I have no recollection
of that whatsoever.

801
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,353
Now, if you're gonna travel
with me to Los Angeles...

802
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,015
...I gotta give you a couple guidelines.
Number one:

803
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:58,186
If you ask me a single question,
I'm going to flip out on you.

804
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,447
- So don't do that. Do you understand?
- Somewhat, yes.

805
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,734
If you fall asleep for any reason...

806
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,904
...other than the fact that
you're in a bed and it's nighttime...

807
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,447
...I will disembowel you.

808
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,785
Make sense?

809
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,074
- Somewhat.
- Great.

810
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:15,586
If you're allergic to waffles,
don't eat waffles.

811
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,372
- Then don't take me to a Waffle House.
- Shut up!

812
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,587
- Relax.
- Get your stuff and get in back.

813
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,092
- Hold Sonny.
- Nope.

814
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,219
Hand me that dog, I will rip it in half.

815
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,134
You better check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

816
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,614
And then, his fault,
we're both put on a No-Fly list.

817
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,778
- A No-Fly list? You?
- Yeah, and it just--

818
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:54,951
Yeah. Just got worse from there.
Because he's pathological, I think.

819
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,994
He'll just start beating off.

820
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,253
- What?
- Yes.

821
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,461
- No lotion?
- No, no, he was dry-docking.

822
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,007
Is that a drainage ditch coming up?

823
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,094
Yes, it is.

824
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,803
- Would you mind?
- I'm hitting it.

825
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,140
Real hard.

826
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,523
Ethan, you all right?

827
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,817
Yeah, we're good.

828
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,779
Next time, don't tense up your body.
Just stay loose.

829
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:33,614
- There's another one up here too.
- Want to hit him again?

830
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,341
We can't take your Range Rover, D.

831
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,380
Yes, you can. I prefer my pickup anyway.

832
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:53,518
- I'll ship it back as soon as I get there.
- No need. I'll be in L.A. on Friday.

833
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,644
You will? What are you doing in L.A.?

834
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,851
I'm not gonna miss
the birth of your baby.

835
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,688
Doesn't it burn you up
that she's getting a C-section?

836
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,571
I mean, that body was so flawless,
just banging.

837
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,322
How did you know we were
getting a C-section?

838
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,483
She told me. Coffee?

839
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,326
Sure.

840
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,584
What is going on?

841
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,502
What are you talking about?

842
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,210
What's with all these stories
he has about your wife?

843
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,874
They used to date in college?

844
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,508
It was like 20 years ago.

845
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,385
Yeah, but come on, you don't see it?

846
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,673
This guy's good-looking.
He's a football player. He's charming.

847
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,264
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- He has beautiful hands.

848
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,803
I think there's something going on.

849
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,519
- Here you go.
- What's this picture from?

850
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,854
- What's that?
- This picture of you and Sarah.

851
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,861
Oh, yeah, that was February.
We was in San Diego.

852
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,192
She didn't tell you?

853
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,699
She mentioned that she bumped into you.
She didn't say that--

854
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:54,078
That we were throwing them back.
Getting wasted, having a good time.

855
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,705
Just sort of reliving some things,
you know, just ....

856
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,458
- Real good girl. Fantastic.
- She is. Slipped her mind.

857
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,712
February. isn't that about
nine months ago?

858
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,085
- No questions.
- Nine, 10 months.

859
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,925
Nine.

860
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,846
Where you at with the names?
She said you were being a real hard-ass.

861
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:15,554
- She said that?
- Yeah, she hit me in a e-mail.

862
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,469
- You and his wife exchange e-mails?
- Yeah.

863
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,263
What else do you exchange?

864
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,227
- Ethan.
- Body fluids?

865
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,817
- What is he talking about?
- I don't even listen to him.

866
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,070
This is not bothering you? The e-mails--

867
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,571
Each ether's ejaculate?

868
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:30,898
What?

869
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,612
It's when your urine turns white.

870
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,244
Okay, new rule: You can't...

871
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,872
...say a fucking word.

872
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,079
This is horrible. It tastes like cat litter.

873
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,663
I think it tastes delicious.

874
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,705
You should. I was all out,
so I used the coffee you brought.

875
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,464
Oh, boy.

876
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,253
That's his dad, it's his dad.

877
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:53,262
Fine. I'll buy some other coffee.
I apologize. What's the big deal?

878
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,592
His dad is the coffee.

879
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,975
He passed away and his remains
were in the fucking can.

880
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,554
Get him the fuck out.
The beard, the dog, get him out!

881
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,142
- I get it.
- Get him out!

882
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,023
I know. It took eight minutes, right?

883
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,490
Oh, God! So stupid!

884
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,199
Where are the ashes?
Where are my dad's ashes?

885
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,662
Relax.

886
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,619
- It was an accident.
- Where is it?

887
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,332
- Where?
- Right where I'm pointing.

888
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,543
There's the coffee machine right there.

889
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,459
There's the can, there's the Coffeemaker.

890
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:35,675
We're gonna retrieve this.
I got it, I got it. Slow down, it's okay.

891
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,340
Can we just calm down?

892
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,058
Let me take it.

893
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,727
Oh, God.

894
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,977
Will you relax?

895
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,480
Oh!

896
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,148
it's okay.

897
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,908
Come here, I'll help you pick it up.

898
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,326
There we go.

899
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,333
Get it back in there.

900
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,039
I'm sorry we drank your father.

901
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,331
It's okay.

902
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,705
Are you all right? Are you sure?

903
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,591
Yeah, there's plenty of him still in here.

904
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,052
Darryl only made three cups of coffee...

905
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:00,761
...and I think there's about eight cups
of my dad left in here.

906
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,175
Great.

907
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,264
At least he tasted good.

908
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,977
Not bad.

909
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,733
Yeah, strong.

910
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,896
He was full-flavored.

911
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,899
Robust blend.

912
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:21,239
He really enjoyed coffee.

913
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,406
And in the end,
he was enjoyed as coffee.

914
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,249
Kind of circle of life.

915
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,577
Lion King. All that.

916
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:37,919
I'll tell you what, the moratorium on
asking questions is officially lifted.

917
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,920
Fire away.

918
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,717
Okay.

919
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,926
- How's your arm?
- Not bad.

920
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:47,436
Do you think Darryl slept with your wife?

921
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,264
- No.
- I do.

922
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,104
I mean, why would he lend you
this very fancy car...

923
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:56,111
...and give you all that
walking-around money? It's ....

924
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:57,943
Because he's my friend.

925
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,940
That's why.

926
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,780
Have you ever been
to the San Diego Zoo?

927
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,616
I have a question for you.

928
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,622
How did those three questions
come into your head?

929
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,957
I was thinking about your wife and Darryl,
Darryl getting your wife pregnant.

930
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,123
What their baby would look like,
maybe like a zebra baby.

931
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,133
Then I thought,
"Well, I've never seen a zebra."

932
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,466
And I thought, "Well, I should maybe
go to the San Diego Zoo...

933
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,723
- ...when we get to California--"
- Nope, I've never been to the zoo.

934
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,555
Next question, please.

935
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,931
Hey, hon.

936
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:33,357
It's your ever-faithful and adoring husband
calling from West Texas.

937
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,562
Just checking in.

938
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,355
Weird, it went to voicemail.
Are you on the other line with Darryl?

939
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,982
I actually talked to him...

940
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,861
...and he told me about the lovely weekend
you guys spent in San Diego.

941
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,076
Didn't jibe with the way
you recounted it...

942
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,991
...so maybe with all your e-mails
and phone calls...

943
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,910
...you can get your story straight.

944
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,837
If there's something you need to tell me
before we go down this road...

945
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,548
...if I'm gonna have a surprise
in the delivery room...

946
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,055
...I would just appreciate it
that you erase any and all--

947
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,681
Call me.

948
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,512
- Was I right or was I wrong?
- About what?

949
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:15,190
The Darryl thing, your wife,
and the mystery about the baby.

950
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,226
She's sleeping. I left a message.

951
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,607
And the casual manner with which you
bring up this topic, it makes me edgy.

952
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,993
So if you wouldn't mind not doing that
anymore I'd really appreciate it.

953
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,078
- I got some snacks.
- Yes, I see.

954
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,911
Unfortunately, I need you to drive.
I'm on Vicodin.

955
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,918
I'm not supposed to operate
heavy machinery.

956
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,874
I will tell you this:

957
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:40,758
If you blink, if you even look like you
might be dozing, let alone fall asleep...

958
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:45,262
...I'm gonna put hands on you. I'm gonna
choke you out with your own scarf.

959
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,550
Wrap that thing around your neck
and choke you the fuck out. Promise.

960
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,144
Seems a bit drastic.

961
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,600
Take off your glasses.

962
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,686
I bought them,
I wanted to showcase them.

963
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,270
It's night. You're driving.

964
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,937
You act like you've never been
in a fender-bender.

965
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,481
- Remove them.
- Okay.

966
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,909
- Jolt Cola? Drink it.
- Yeah.

967
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:11,743
- You're not the boss of me, you know.
- I know. Just drink it.

968
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,991
Please.

969
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,922
Attaboy.

970
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,755
By the way, when I fell asleep...

971
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,924
...that was a one-time occurrence.

972
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:35,100
- I know what I'm doing. I'm a grown man.
- Did you remember to use the restroom?

973
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,684
Oh.

974
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,660
Hey you, out there on your own

975
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,954
Sitting naked by the phone

976
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,168
Would you touch me?

977
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:08,383
Hey you, with your ear against the wall

978
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:12,554
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?

979
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:22,686
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?

980
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,986
Open your heart, I'm coming home

981
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,039
This is some stuff.

982
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,000
This window is not working.

983
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,088
No, I locked them so we could get
a good clambake going on in here.

984
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,343
That way, Sonny could get stoned.

985
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,015
Am I stoned?

986
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,347
Do you feel stoned?

987
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,746
But it was only fantasy

988
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,792
No matter how he tried
He could not break free

989
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,508
And the worms ate into his brain

990
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:45,939
Hey you
Don 't tell me there 's no hope at all

991
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,732
Together we stand

992
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,402
Divided we fall

993
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,502
Then what? How did it resolve?

994
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:09,045
Well, it turns out the cheese grater
was underneath the mattress.

995
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:14,513
Ha, ha!
That is so sophisticated. And has heart.

996
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,763
The show has heart.

997
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,267
How do you know so much about this?

998
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:22,646
I run a fan site for the show. Not official,
but I've run a fan site for about six years.

999
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,973
I started it at an internet caf.

1000
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,517
Used to go in there and wash my feet.

1001
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,856
What was the site called?

1002
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,567
It'sRainingTwoAndAHalfMen.com.

1003
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:33,944
Wow.

1004
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:38,196
That is sublime. Can I retract every
derogatory statement I've made about you?

1005
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,831
Thank you, Peter. That's very sweet.

1006
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,287
- Hand me a Bugle.
- Sure.

1007
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,499
Thank you.

1008
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,789
- Will you feed one to the hound?
- Very well.

1009
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,963
Are we on the highway still?

1010
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,177
Relax, Peter, I've got it covered.

1011
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,512
Are you certain?

1012
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,644
You're getting paranoid.
That pot got to you.

1013
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,973
Okay. All right, you see the flag?

1014
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,230
It looks like a border crossing,
it says "Mexico"--

1015
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,316
- Oh, Lord. Gosh.
- What?

1016
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,323
I thought that said Texaco.
We're low on gas.

1017
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,325
- Okay, we're fine.
- Yep.

1018
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,031
We're good. We're good.

1019
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,662
What are you gonna tell them?

1020
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,164
All I'm gonna do is say,
"Look, we made a mistake."

1021
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:26,076
- And we're gonna ask to turn around.
- Perfect.

1022
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,710
Okay, I need you to be quiet.
Sit straight. Don't say anything.

1023
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,500
Won't that be suspicious
if they ask me a question?

1024
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,669
- Let me handle everything.
- You handle it.

1025
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,008
- Here we go.
- Uh-oh. He's looking right at me.

1026
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,515
Peter, please be quiet, okay?

1027
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,511
I'm sorry.

1028
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,099
Hello. The weirdest thing happened.
We just kind of got shifted--

1029
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,518
Are you guys American citizens?

1030
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,061
Yes. Yes, we are.

1031
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,025
- The both of you?
- Yes, absolutely.

1032
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,189
Can I see your passports?

1033
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,699
We don't have passports.

1034
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,573
The thing is,
we didn't mean to end up here.

1035
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:05,286
Somehow, I must have taken
the wrong exit, and we're here, so ....

1036
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,122
If we could just maybe turn around
and go back?

1037
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,249
You wanna turn around?

1038
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,915
Yeah, it was a mistake.
We're trying to get back--

1039
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,001
What's wrong with your friend?

1040
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,591
Peter, don't do that.

1041
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,723
Why are your eyes so glassy?
You been partying?

1042
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,717
No, I have glaucoma.

1043
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:27,433
What about your friend,
does he have glaucoma too?

1044
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:32,062
Answer the man. Do you have glaucoma?
No, he doesn't have glaucoma.

1045
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,819
What about the dog,
does he have glaucoma?

1046
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,901
Because his eyes are glassy as fuck.

1047
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,868
Shut off the car.
Give me the keys, please.

1048
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,907
Wait right here.

1049
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,296
- Did I blow it?
- No, we're fine.

1050
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,419
You are smooth.

1051
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,842
- Wow.
- Hand me Sonny, please.

1052
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,756
God, my heart was in my throat.
I was flipping out.

1053
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:06,510
Could you hand me my father's ashes?
They're on the floorboard.

1054
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,764
Wow. What's--? What are you doing?

1055
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,622
We took the wrong exit,
we wound up here by mistake.

1056
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,409
No matter how many times you ask,
that's my answer.

1057
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,623
You sound like Jason Bourne, man.

1058
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,380
You don't know where you're going.
No ID.

1059
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,167
I wanna speak to
the American consulate.

1060
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,676
I'm American, I have rights.

1061
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,461
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1062
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,802
Hey, Ramon.
He wants to talk to his consulate.

1063
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,063
Hello, sir.
Welcome to the American consulate.

1064
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,520
- How can I help you?
- That's unacceptable.

1065
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:01,156
What are you laughing about?
This is a serious matter. I have rights.

1066
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,316
You americanos sneak into our country.

1067
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,494
You bring drugs, you party.
You sleep with our women.

1068
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,076
I've never heard of an American
sneaking into Mexico.

1069
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,867
This would be an isolated incident.
it's usually the reverse.

1070
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,541
I'm getting tired of your cavalier attitude.

1071
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,546
Well, I apologize. I'm sorry.

1072
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:21,335
You attempted to transport drugs
across an international border...

1073
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,257
...dude.

1074
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,635
This is serious shit.

1075
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,425
Okay, Daddy.

1076
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,840
There.

1077
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,657
Shit!

1078
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,630
Son of a bitch!

1079
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,093
Stop!

1080
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,644
Help!

1081
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,147
Oh, shoot.

1082
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,085
- Pull over!
- What the fuck?

1083
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,263
Pull the car over!

1084
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,058
Hold on, Sonny, it's about to get rough.

1085
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,650
Oh, God.

1086
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,886
Ethan?

1087
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,014
Hollywood!

1088
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,827
Oh, crud.

1089
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,411
Peter? Peter, are you okay?

1090
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,092
How many laws did we just break?

1091
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,427
I don't know, 60?

1092
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,051
I had no idea where I was going.

1093
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,845
Then I see you. Remember,
when we jackknifed together?

1094
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:03,356
- But you didn't look like you.
- We locked eyes.

1095
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,358
- God, you looked crazy!
- Yeah. Well, I'm in stealth mode.

1096
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,737
- That's why I got the scarf on my head.
- You were like a commando.

1097
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,739
- You were a Comanche warrior.
- Thanks.

1098
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,900
- It was the greatest ever.
- Thank you.

1099
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,319
Don't move. Ready?

1100
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,825
What? Oh.

1101
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,332
That's your new headshot.
Ha-ha-ha!

1102
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:25,203
- Yeah.
- How could it not be?

1103
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,584
God, the pain is extraordinary.

1104
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,630
- Will you e-mail that to me, please?
- Yeah.

1105
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,054
Okay. All right. Just not too much, Peter.

1106
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,263
Rescue. A daring rescue.

1107
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,061
- You came back for me.
- Of course I did.

1108
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,642
You're so brave.

1109
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:46,479
I made you a promise.
I told you I was gonna get you home.

1110
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,393
I'm getting you home safe, okay?

1111
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,441
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- What?

1112
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,106
- I'm gonna give you a smooch.
- No.

1113
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,444
- Come on, baby.
- No way!

1114
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,781
- Give me a little smooch.
- Stop, Peter! I'm driving! Oh!

1115
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,661
Sick!

1116
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,073
You got it.

1117
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:04,584
- Everything's up and down with you.
- I owe you bigtime.

1118
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,961
No way I'd see my kid
if you hadn't done that.

1119
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,955
There's no way.

1120
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,965
I love you, dude.

1121
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,969
I love you too, Peter.

1122
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,809
Oh, dear.

1123
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,315
Sweetheart, I am so sorry.

1124
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,485
You know how I get.
I've always been jealous. It's ....

1125
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,325
You knew about that.
I told you I ran into him there.

1126
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:45,833
I know, and I know it has nothing to do
with you. it's just my shit. it's my shit.

1127
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,996
Just listen to me, okay? Don't say anything.
Just listen to me.

1128
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:52,166
I would never betray you,
Peter, you know that.

1129
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,759
We're a family now.

1130
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,336
Nothing else matters.
Do you understand?

1131
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:02,551
- You're so right.
- Can you just get home safely, please?

1132
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,644
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

1133
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,871
Wake up. Ethan.

1134
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,332
Check it out.

1135
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,606
I'm telling you, I wouldn't make it up.

1136
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,067
You sure? I could've sworn
I read it was man-made.

1137
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:00,404
Nope. Not correct. Very old.
Formed over time.

1138
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,194
Grand Canyon. Known fact.

1139
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,035
Peter, I have a photogenic memory.
I have recall for--

1140
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:11,078
Ethan, I promise you. it's old. it's the
Grand Canyon, it's not the Hoover Dam.

1141
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,839
Well, I know it's not the Hoover Dam,
that was built by the Pilgrims.

1142
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,916
Also incorrect.

1143
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,256
It's magnificent though.

1144
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,848
- You didn't have to stop, you know.
- That's okay. it's the perfect place.

1145
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,301
Let's hit the road.
I can do that any time.

1146
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,221
We've got time.
We don't have to be in L.A. till morning.

1147
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:31,765
What are you doing? Relax.

1148
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,980
We should just stick with the plan,
you know?

1149
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,565
But I thought this was part of the plan.

1150
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,650
What am I missing, Ethan?

1151
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,693
What's really going on?

1152
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,739
When I said the Grand Canyon
wasn't on the way, you said:

1153
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,906
"Too bad, it would've been perfect."

1154
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,292
When we passed
the Mississippi River you said:

1155
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,202
"Too bad, Dad loved titties and jazz."

1156
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:57,624
I just-- You know, we got stuff to do
and I don't wanna step on it.

1157
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,758
I know it's hard to say goodbye.

1158
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:04,343
And I didn't know your dad, but from what
you've told me he was a great father.

1159
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:06,716
He was a cool guy.

1160
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:09,557
I'm just saying.

1161
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:11,846
I'm just suggesting.

1162
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,314
If you got it in you...

1163
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,528
...he deserves a grand gesture.

1164
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,074
Okay.

1165
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:36,879
Come on, Sonny.

1166
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,177
Come here, sweetheart. Yeah.

1167
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,021
Dad, you were like a father to me.

1168
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:05,069
And...

1169
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,655
...I don't know how
I'm gonna make it without you.

1170
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:20,044
But I know that you'll look after me
from up there.

1171
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,588
I'm gonna make you proud, Dad.

1172
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,681
Okay.

1173
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,551
I promise.

1174
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,805
I love you.

1175
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,234
Say hi to Mom.

1176
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,462
Bye, Daddy.

1177
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:14,435
He was a greet guy. You would've
loved him. He was just like me.

1178
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,018
Hey ....

1179
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:26,448
There's something I've been wanting
to tell you I feel pretty awful about.

1180
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,859
I kind of want to get it off my chest. I ....

1181
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,956
I ditched you at the rest stop
in Louisiana.

1182
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,494
- What?
- I had no intention of coming back.

1183
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,129
So wrong.

1184
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,252
Why would you do that?

1185
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:47,134
Because I'm a pig. I'm an asshole.
I'm working on it.

1186
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,973
Well, you know what?
You came back with doughnuts.

1187
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,893
I think that says more
about you than leaving does.

1188
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,474
So...

1189
01:15:58,179 --> 01:15:59,226
...just--

1190
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,140
You're something else. Thanks.

1191
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,818
That's a load off.

1192
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:11,902
Well, there's something I've been
wanting to get off my chest too.

1193
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,160
Shoot.

1194
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:16,990
I'm not really 23 years old.

1195
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:20,872
I know.

1196
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:22,666
It's okay.

1197
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,040
The other thing is...

1198
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,502
...Peter...

1199
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,847
...I have your wallet
and I've had it this whole time.

1200
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,474
What?

1201
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,307
What are you talking about?

1202
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,182
Peter...

1203
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,475
...okay,
listen.

1204
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,357
Why would you do that?

1205
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,490
I saw it on the plane
and I didn't wanna be alone.

1206
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:53,492
I was feeling vulnerable
because of my father's death.

1207
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:57,656
And I just didn't wanna go across country
by myself, you know?

1208
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,079
- it's all here.
- Yeah.

1209
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:04,587
All my money, all my credit cards.
Everything ....

1210
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,540
Everything I needed.

1211
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,591
This whole time.

1212
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:17,675
- You're okay with it?
- it's in the past.

1213
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,886
What are you gonna do?

1214
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,307
- Okay.
- Okay.

1215
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,193
- Thanks, Peter.
- Yep.

1216
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,105
Okay. Okay.
Let's just hit the road then, right?

1217
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:34,242
- You get Sonny, and I'll drive.
- I'll grab him in a minute.

1218
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,744
- After I fucking kill you!
- OW!

1219
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,914
You little thief prick.

1220
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,915
Die, thief. You thief.

1221
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:43,534
Calm down!

1222
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,088
Peter, count to 10. it'll help. Aah!

1223
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,550
The phone's ringing!

1224
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,343
- Hello, dear.
- Peter, it's happening.

1225
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,807
- What?
- You won't believe it. My water broke.

1226
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,981
- How?
- Where are you?

1227
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,018
I'm at the Grand Canyon.
I'll be there in a minute.

1228
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,438
What? Did you just say
the Grand Canyon?

1229
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:14,949
Peter?

1230
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:18,031
Mom? He's at the Grand Canyon.

1231
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,946
Oh, my God.

1232
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:22,198
- Who was it?
- My wife has gone into labor.

1233
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,785
- I thought we were having a C-section.
- Get in the car.

1234
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,876
You stepped on my Capezios.
Okay, okay, okay!

1235
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,541
Let's go!

1236
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,126
Good God, you maniac.

1237
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:52,149
Not gonna make it. That's great.
I'm gonna miss the birth of my child.

1238
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,154
We are gonna make it.

1239
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,315
There's no "we." Don't say "we."

1240
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:03,035
- Okay, look-- No. Me first.
- Please, can I--?

1241
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,325
No. You can't. I told you I saw red.

1242
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:08,415
I told you I was gonna put hands on you.
I have a problem.

1243
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,501
And I'm sorry you were
the recipient of it.

1244
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,337
But I warned you.

1245
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,085
- I'm sorry.
- Fine.

1246
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,096
But in the future,
when we're hanging out as buddies...

1247
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,384
...if we get into a fight,
don't go for my face.

1248
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:25,268
- That's how I make a living. Okay?
- Okay.

1249
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:27,975
Still bleeding.

1250
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:31,062
Check the glove, there's probably
a first-aid kit or something.

1251
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:33,770
Clean yourself up.

1252
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,863
Check this thing out.

1253
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:49,035
Oh, shoot.

1254
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,376
I can't believe I did that.

1255
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,050
Sorry, Peter. I'm so sorry.

1256
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,224
I didn't think it was loaded. Pull over.

1257
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,306
- No, I wanna keep going.
- No. Pull over.

1258
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:07,811
- I don't want to.
- Pull over.

1259
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,393
No, it didn't happen,
it didn't happen! Why'?!

1260
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,605
- I'm in shock!
- It burns!

1261
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,571
Pull over! Pull over!

1262
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,903
Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!

1263
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,335
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

1264
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,086
It's right there, yep.

1265
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:42,884
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry.

1266
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,141
We gotta stop the bleeding.
I need your scarf.

1267
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:48,644
- Turn around?
- No. No, a tourniquet. A tourniquet.

1268
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,270
What the fuck are you doing?

1269
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,023
Turn around! Stay still. I got it.

1270
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:57,028
You're fine. Right here.
I need you to tie it. I only got one hand.

1271
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,439
It's deep.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1272
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,778
We're going to a hospital.
We're gonna be fine.

1273
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,283
Oh, God! What did I do?

1274
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:06,616
- Stop freaking out. it's okay.
- What did I do? What did I do?

1275
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:10,829
Let's do a little acting exercise like we did
at the rest stop in the bathroom, okay?

1276
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:13,627
You're a sergeant,
I'm just a grunt in your platoon...

1277
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:18,007
...but you promised me that you'd get me
home to my high-school sweetheart.

1278
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,968
Okay.

1279
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,461
Action.

1280
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,175
- Peter.
- Yeah?

1281
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:29,844
I puked on the wound.

1282
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,637
I know. it's okay, buddy.

1283
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,231
I need you to drive, but we gotta go.

1284
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,858
Okay?

1285
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,948
Come on.

1286
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:47,157
Get in the back seat, private.
What are you, a girl or something?

1287
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,491
- Excellent.
- Like that?

1288
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,156
- Yeah, let's roll.
- Yeah, okay.

1289
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,162
- Figured it out yet?
- Figured what out?

1290
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,699
Your son's about to be born.
What will you name him?

1291
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,540
- I'll know it when I see him.
- How about "Sonny"?

1292
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:39,455
No. Not naming my son
after a masturbating dog.

1293
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,215
Don't listen to him, Sonny. He loves you.

1294
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,217
Sonny, no!

1295
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,588
Sonny. Sorry.

1296
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,681
We're heading home!

1297
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,905
I made it.

1298
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,031
- Okay, come on.
- I made it.

1299
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,947
Oh, the monkey, the monkey,
the monkey.

1300
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:17,126
Sonny, we'll be right back, okay?

1301
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,790
Got it.

1302
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,581
Oh, fuck.

1303
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,090
Thank you.

1304
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,678
I have an expectant father
and a gunshot victim.

1305
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,555
I know where we're going. Right here.

1306
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,515
Then we out left.

1307
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,102
- Shoot.
- What?

1308
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,262
I forgot to crack a window for Sonny.

1309
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:40,148
- The door's off the car, Ethan.
- Right. Okay, good.

1310
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:42,981
See? Together we think of everything.

1311
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:49,153
Okay, here we go.

1312
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,655
- Let's get you cleaned up. Right?
- Great. Yeah.

1313
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,664
Give me these guys.

1314
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,873
It's all about to go down.

1315
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:03,460
Give you a vest, cover up the blood.

1316
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,640
Have I told you that I love your perm?

1317
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,303
Thank you, Peter.

1318
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:17,470
Look who's come around.

1319
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:19,263
Sarah?

1320
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,978
No, come on, come on.
This way, this way. Here we go.

1321
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,563
Ma'am.
- Here we go.

1322
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,070
Put your handcuffs in your pocket.
Hide them.

1323
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,152
- Here's the Rally Monkey.
- Boom.

1324
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,321
- Ohh!
- Just keep pushing.

1325
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,031
Sarah?

1326
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,328
- Sarah?
- Peter?

1327
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,488
- You hear that?
- Go!

1328
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,158
- Peter!
- Sarah!

1329
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,581
Darryl. What the fuck?

1330
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,170
- Whoa, whoa. Whoa, hey.
- Who the hell is this guy?

1331
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,880
You gotta go, man. You gotta go.

1332
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:51,511
- Peter!
- Peter, it's this way.

1333
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,513
What the fuck?

1334
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,175
Baby! Baby, you made it!

1335
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:59,595
- Jesus, Peter, are you okay?
- Baby?

1336
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,855
No, I just lost a little blood.

1337
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,184
- Ohh! Oh, my God!
- Everybody relax.

1338
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,352
Relax. We need to find a hospital, okay?

1339
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,613
- Who are you?
- My name is Ethan Tremblay.

1340
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:12,365
- I'm your husband's best friend.
- it's nice to meet you.

1341
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:15,528
Nice to meet you too.
Let's get that baby out of your vagina.

1342
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,196
Okay.

1343
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:19,615
- Breathe.
- Ahh!

1344
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,462
Look at the babies.

1345
01:25:25,746 --> 01:25:28,750
Look at that baby, right?

1346
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,711
You see it?

1347
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:33,879
- Hey. What do we got?
- You little rascal.

1348
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,548
- Look what you made.
- Show me.

1349
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:40,136
Ohh. He's really cute.

1350
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,554
That's a handsome boy.

1351
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,769
- It's a girl, actually.
- Mm-mm.

1352
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:46,229
- Yep.
- No, the--

1353
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,393
Dr. Greene says it happens all the time.

1354
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,608
You know, ultrasounds
aren't always reliable.

1355
01:25:50,771 --> 01:25:51,818
Right.

1356
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,779
- Little Rosie.
- Rosie?

1357
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:58,954
Little Rosie Highman.
Does that sound strange to you?

1358
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,830
No, it's such a pretty name.

1359
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,162
Sarah thought you'd be okay with it.

1360
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:06,750
- When did you talk to Sarah?
- Right after I cut the umbilical cord.

1361
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:12,134
- You out it?
- The tether of life from mother to child.

1362
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,418
I got to cut that.

1363
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:14,882
- No.
- Yes.

1364
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,092
- You?
- I kept some.

1365
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,598
I kept a little bit of it
and put it in my wallet.

1366
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:22,636
- it's good for sore ankles and stuff.
- Wow.

1367
01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:26,853
Wow. Oh, my God.

1368
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,855
Oh, my God. Ethan, I dreamt this.

1369
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,942
- This is crazy. I had this strange dream...
- Yeah?

1370
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:34,448
...that was today.

1371
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,654
And there was a bear.

1372
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:38,531
What?

1373
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,446
- And the bear chewed the cord.
- Mm-hm.

1374
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,912
That's spot-on if you think about it.
That's like a one in a ....

1375
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,121
You know what I mean?

1376
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,206
- I don't get it. What--?
- Forget it.

1377
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,292
It's-- it's....

1378
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,800
It's gotta be a good sign.

1379
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:00,883
I guess I'll maybe leave you
with your family...

1380
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,393
...and I got that meeting with that agent.

1381
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:04,599
- it's Friday.
- Yeah.

1382
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:05,853
Yeah, good luck.

1383
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,600
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

1384
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,857
It has all of my information.

1385
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:15,898
- Mm-hm.
- In case you wanna get a soda.

1386
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,987
- Or, you know, I could babysit.
- Right.

1387
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,827
I'll keep it handy.

1388
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,872
We had a crazy few days.

1389
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,540
That was nuts.

1390
01:27:29,703 --> 01:27:32,001
We should do it again.
Go across country again.

1391
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,166
Okay.

1392
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,919
- Sure.
- Call me tomorrow about it.

1393
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,763
- If I don't--
- Call me tomorrow about it.

1394
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,595
I might e-mail you.
Please don't take it personally.

1395
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:43,930
No, no, e-mail's fine.

1396
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:50,065
- Bye, Sonny.
- Do you mind if Sonny and I take the truck?

1397
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,691
Feel free.

1398
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,771
- it's been a real pleasure, Peter.
- Been a lot of things.

1399
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,200
Thanks.

1400
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,205
Hey. Ethan.

1401
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,379
Welcome to Hollywood.

1402
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,795
What? You want me
to come back and talk to you?

1403
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,055
I was just saying
in the most general sense.

1404
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,553
The city welcomes you.

1405
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,970
Just make sure you call me tomorrow.

1406
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:30,393
I'll call you.

1407
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:41,484
Be right there.

1408
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,326
Hello?

1409
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:52,502
Oh, hey. I'm Stu, the tutor.
Are you Jake?

1410
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,288
No, I'm his father.

1411
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,172
Oh.

1412
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:58,466
I'm Stu, the tutor.

1413
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,252
Right.

1414
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,921
Have you been smoking pot?

1415
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,136
No, sir. Not at all.

1416
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,931
Perhaps you're smelling my cat.

1417
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,098
- Your oat?
- Yes, sir. He's an outdoor cat.

1418
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,608
You know what, he's really funny.

1419
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,815
Don't get crazy.
I'm telling you, the show's funny.

1420
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:20,356
Come on. You love him.
You know you love him.

1421
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,775
I survived him. There's e difference.

1422
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:26,536
Um, uh, Charlie, this is Jake 's tutor, Stu.

1423
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,448
- Hey.
- I'm not high, man, it's my cat.

1424
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:33,118
Relax, Stu. We're not cops.

1425
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,162
Oh, really? He sure looks like the heat.

1426
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,502
Like clockwork. I told him
we'd call him after we watched it.

1427
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:40,338
He's excited.

1428
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,887
If she says his name, I'll freak out.

1429
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,222
Pita bread?

1430
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:47,632
Hummus?

1431
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,468
Again, no thank you.

1432
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,980
You got any more pot?

1433
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:56,850
Not for $9 an hour I don't.

1434
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:00,149
I mean, I don't know
what you're talking about.
