1
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,737
Slave in the Magic Mirror,

2
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,282
come from the farthest space.

3
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,203
Through wind and darkness,
I summon thee.

4
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,372
Speak!

5
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,917
Let me see thy face.

6
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,047
What wouldst thou know, my Queen?

7
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,925
Magic Mirror on the wall,

8
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,095
who is the fairest one of all?

9
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,683
Famed is thy beauty, Majesty.

10
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,895
But hold, a lovely maid I see.

11
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,275
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace.

12
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:18,322
Alas, she is more fair than thee.

13
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:22,451
Alas for her! Reveal her name.

14
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,496
Lips red as the rose.

15
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,583
Hair black as ebony.

16
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,127
Skin white as snow.

17
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,130
Snow White!

18
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,334
Want to know a secret?

19
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,210
Promise not to tell?

20
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:18,007
We are standing bу a wishing well

21
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,136
Make a wish into the well

22
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,847
That's all уou have to do

23
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,017
Аnd if уou hear it eсhoing

24
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,520
Your wish will soon come true

25
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,359
-I'm wishing
-I'm wishing

26
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,195
For the one l love

27
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,657
-To find me
-To find me

28
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,368
-Today

00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,038
-I'm hoрing

30
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,208
Аnd I'm dreaming of

31
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,586
-The niсe things
-The niсe things

32
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,547
-Нe'll say

00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,574
-Today

37
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,244
-Oh!
-Hello.

38
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,413
-Oh.
-Did I frighten you?

39
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,582
Wait! Wait, please.

40
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,210
Don't run away.

41
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,922
Now that l've found you

42
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:44,301
Нear what l have to say

43
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,805
One song

44
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,475
l have but one song

45
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:56,939
One song onlу for you

46
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:05,072
One heart tenderlу beating

47
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,993
Ever entreating

48
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,497
Сonstant and true

49
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,084
One love

50
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,963
That has рossessed me

51
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,467
One love

52
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:29,138
Thrilling me through

53
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,641
One song

54
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:37,021
My heart keeрs singing

55
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,649
Of one love

56
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:46,655
Onlу for you

57
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,672
Take her far into the forest.

58
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,009
Find some secluded glade

59
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,637
where she can pick wildflowers.

60
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,847
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,726
And there, my faithful Huntsman,

62
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,187
you will kill her!

63
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,815
But, Your Majesty, the little Princess!

64
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,399
Silence!

65
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,695
You know the penalty if you fail.

66
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:30,324
Yes, Your Majesty.

67
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,494
But to make doubly sure

68
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,247
you do not fail,

69
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,544
bring back her heart in this.

70
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,056
One song, I have but one song

71
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,781
Hello there.

72
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,741
What's the matter?

73
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,536
Where's your mama and papa?

74
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,205
Why, I believe you're lost.

75
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,749
Oh, please don't cry.

76
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,215
Come on, perk up.

77
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,885
Won't you smile for me?

78
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,928
That's better.

79
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,473
Your mama and papa can't be far.

80
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,311
There they are!

81
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,064
Can you fly?

82
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,943
Good-bye. Good-bye!

83
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,078
I can't, I can't do it.

84
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:03,167
Forgive me.
I beg of Your Highness, forgive me.

85
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,044
I don't understand!

86
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,755
She's mad, jealous of you!
She'll stop at nothing!

87
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,174
-But, but who?
-The Queen.

88
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,258
-The Queen?
-Now, quick, child, run.

89
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,761
Run away, hide!

90
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,847
In the woods! Anywhere!
Never come back!

91
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,809
Now, go. Go! Go!

92
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:25,022
Run! Run! Hide!

93
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,058
Oh!

94
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,230
Please don't run away.

95
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,983
I won't hurt you.

96
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm awfully sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

97
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,117
But you don't know
what I've been through.

98
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,912
And all because I was afraid.

99
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,582
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.

100
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,170
What do you do
when things go wrong?

101
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,591
Oh! You sing a song!

102
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,582
With a smile and a song

103
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,086
Life is just like a bright, sunny day

104
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,506
Your сares fade away

105
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,301
Аnd your heart is young

106
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,516
With a smile and a song

107
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,103
Аll the worId seems to waken anew

108
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,356
Rejoiсing with you

109
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,693
Аs the song is sung

110
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,573
There's no use in grumbling

111
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,034
When raindroрs сome tumbling

112
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,664
Remember you're the one

113
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:16,670
Who сan fill the worId with sunshine

114
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,382
When you smile and you sing

115
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:25,220
Everything is in tune and it's sрring

116
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,724
Аnd life flows along

117
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:33,896
With a smile and a song

118
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,487
I really feel quite happy now.

119
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,947
I'm sure I'll get along somehow.

120
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,867
Everything's going to be all right.

121
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,205
But I do need a place to sleep at night.

122
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,042
I can't sleep in the ground like you

123
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,045
or in a tree the way you do.

124
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,716
And I'm sure no nest would possibly
be big enough for me.

125
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,386
Maybe you know where I can stay.

126
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,889
In the woods somewhere?

127
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,141
You do?

128
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,311
Will you take me there?

129
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,316
Oh, it's adorable!

130
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,861
Just like a doll's house.

131
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,711
I like it here.

132
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,475
Ooh, it's dark inside.

133
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,155
Guess there's no one home.

134
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,201
Hello?

135
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,329
May I come in?

136
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,437
Oh!

137
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,942
What a cute little chair!

138
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,031
Why, there's seven little chairs!

139
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,617
Must be seven little children.

140
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,246
And from the look of this table,
seven untidy little children.

141
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,252
A pickaxe. A stocking, too!

142
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,592
And a shoe!

143
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,350
And just look at that fireplace.

144
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,310
It's covered with dust.

145
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,112
And look, cobwebs everywhere!

146
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,073
My, my, my!

147
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,409
What a pile of dirty dishes!

148
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,122
And just look at that broom!

149
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,752
Why, they've never swept this room.

150
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,089
You'd think their mother would...

151
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,758
Maybe they have no mother.

152
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,678
Then they're orphans.

153
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,139
That's too bad.

154
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,975
I know!

155
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,602
We'll clean the house
and surprise them.

156
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,105
Then maybe they'll let me stay.

157
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,780
Now, you wash the dishes.

158
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,116
You tidy up the room.

159
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,077
You clean the fireplace.

160
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,163
And I will use the broom.

161
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,547
Just whistle while you work

162
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,679
Аnd сheerfully together
we сan tidy uр the рlaсe

163
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,015
So hum a merry tune

164
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:27,022
lt won't take long when there's a song
to helр you set the рaсe

165
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,357
Аnd as you sweeр the room

166
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,568
lmagine that the broom

167
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:36,865
ls someone that you love and soon
you'll find you're danсing to the tune

168
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,827
Oh, no, no, no, no! Put them in the tub.

169
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,371
When hearts are high the time will fly

170
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,707
So whistle while you work

171
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,052
Not under the rug.

172
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,309
So whistle while you work

173
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,294
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

174
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,546
ln our mine the whole day through

175
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:43,259
To dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
is what we like to do

176
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,512
lt ain't no triсk to get riсh quiсk

177
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,806
lf ya dig, dig, dig
with a shovel or a рiсk

178
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,560
-In a mine
-In a mine

179
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:57,357
-Where a million diamonds
-Shine

180
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,526
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

181
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,861
From early morn 'til night

182
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,574
We dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
uр everything in sight

183
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,077
We dig uр diamonds by the sсore

184
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,329
А thousand rubies

185
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,623
Though we don't know
what we dig 'em for

186
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,959
We dig, dig, dig-a-dig, dig

202
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,413
Let's see what's upstairs.

203
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,231
Oh, what adorable little beds!

204
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,528
And look,
they have their names carved on them.

205
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,573
Doc, Happy,

206
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,366
Sneezy, Dopey...

207
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,202
What funny names for children!

208
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,998
Grumpy, Bashful and Sleepy.

209
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,002
I'm a little sleepy myself.

210
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:43,249

00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,089
Look!

220
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,969
Our house! The lit's light...
The light's lit.

221
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,476
Jiminy Crickets!

222
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,062
-The door is open.
-The chimney's smoking.

223
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,647
-Something's in there.
-Maybe a ghost.

224
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,315
-Or a goblin.
-A demon.

225
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,817
Or a dragon.

226
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,362
Mark my words,
there's trouble a-brewin'.

227
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,865
Felt it coming all day. My corns hurt.

228
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,660
-Gosh!
-That's a bad sign.

229
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,787
-What'll we do?
-Let's sneak up on it.

230
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,623
Yes. We'll squeak up... Sneak up.

231
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,167
Come on, hen... Men. Follow me.

232
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,427
Careful, men.
Search every cook and nanny...

233
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,888
Hook and granny... Crooked fan...

234
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,723
Search everywhere.

235
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,745
Quiet.

236
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,086
Look! The floor, it's been swept!

237
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,258
Chair's been dusted!

238
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,095
Our window's been washed.

239
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,972
Gosh, our cobwebs are missing.

240
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,267
Why, why, why, why,
the whole place is clean!

241
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,145
There's dirty work afoot.

242
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,273
Sink's empty.

243
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,276
Hey, someone stole our dishes!

244
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,988
They ain't stole.
They're hid in the cupboard.

245
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,076
My cup's been washed.

246
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,412
Sugar's gone.

247
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,624
Something's cooking.

248
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,293
Smells good!

249
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,588
Don't touch it, you fools!
Might be poison.

250
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,845
See? It's witches' brew.

251
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,307
Look what's happened
to our stable... Table.

252
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,810
Flowers!

253
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,771
-Huh?
-Look, goldenrod.

254
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,483
Don't do it. Take them away.
My nose! My hay fever!

255
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,654
You know I can't stand it.
I can't... I can't... I... Oh.

256
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,204
Thanks!

257
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,504
Hey!

258
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,181
Ya crazy fool!
Fine time you picked to sneeze!

259
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,017
I couldn't help it. I can't tell.

260
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,562
When you gotta, you gotta.
I... I... I gotta.

261
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,398
It's coming.

262
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,444
-Don't let him.
-Stop him.

263
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,695
Oh!

264
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,615
-No, tie it tight.
-Don't let go.

265
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,074
-Hold him tight.
-I'll tie it.

266
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,618
Make a hard knot.

267
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,828
There, that will hold him.

268
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,873
Thanks!

269
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,210
Quiet, you fool!
You want to get us all killed?

270
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,718
-What's that?
-That's it.

271
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,555
-Sounded close.
-It's in this room right now.

272
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,414
-It's up there.
-Yeah. In the bedroom.

273
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,753
One of us has gotta go down
and chase it up.

274
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,964
Up. Down.

275
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,942
Here, take it.

276
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,945
Don't be nervous.

277
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,631
Don't be afraid. We're right behind you.

278
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,842
Yes! Right behind ya.

279
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,552
Here it comes!

280
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,189
-It's after us.
-Don't let it out.

281
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,857
Hold it shut.

282
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,079
-Here it comes.
-Now's our chance.

283
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,288
Get it now!

284
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,665
-Quick!
-Give it to it!

285
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,750
Don't let it get away!

286
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,839
Hold on there. It's only Dopey.

287
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,758
-Did you see it?
-How big is it?

288
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,386
-Was it a dragon?
-Has it got horns?

289
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,680
-Was it breathing fire?
-Was it droolin'?

290
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,598
What was it doin'?

291
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:45,106
He says it's a,
a monster asleep in our beds!

292
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,149
-Let's attack.
-While it's sleeping.

293
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,275
Yeah, while it's sleeping.

294
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,736
-Hurry, men. It's now or never!
-Off with its head.

295
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,363
-Break its bones.
-Chop it to pieces.

296
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,198
We'll kill it dead.

297
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,018
-Jiminy Crickets!
-Gosh!

298
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,895
-Gee!
-What a monster!

299
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,564
It covers three beds.

300
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,275
Let's kill it before it wakes up.

301
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,235
Which end do we kill?

302
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,140
Well, eh, ah...

303
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,644
-What is it?
-Why, it... It's a girl!

304
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,482
She's mighty purdy.

305
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:14,153
She's beautiful, just like a angel.

306
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,656
Angel, hah! She's a female!

307
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,660
And all females is poison!
They're full of wicked wiles.

308
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,830
What are wicked wiles?

309
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,333
I don't know. But I'm agin 'em.

310
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,836
Not so loud. You'll wake her up.

311
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,006
Let her wake up!
She don't belong here nohow.

312
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,549
-Look out.
-She's movin'.

313
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,718
-She's wakin' up.
-What'll we do?

314
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,178
Hide.

315
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,184
Oh, dear.

316
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,355
I wonder if the children are...

317
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,359
Oh!

318
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,701
Why, why, you're little men!

319
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,042
How do you do?

320
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,217
-I said, how do you do?
-How do you do what?

321
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,595
Oh, you can talk! I'm so glad!

322
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,349
Now, don't tell me who you are.
Let me guess.

323
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,352
I know, you're Doc.

324
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,231
Why, why, why, yes. Yes! That's true.

325
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,235
And you're, you're Bashful.

326
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,738
Oh, gosh!

327
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,618
And you, you're Sleepy.

328
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,745
How'd you guess?

329
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,749
And you?

330
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,962
And you're Sneezy.

331
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,429
-Yes, and you must be...
-Happy, ma'am. That's me.

332
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,390
And this is Dopey. He don't talk none.

333
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,102
-You mean he can't talk?
-He don't know. He never tried.

334
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,605
Oh, that's too bad.

335
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,235
Oh!

336
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,404
You must be Grumpy.

337
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,157
Oh, yes! Yes!

338
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,619
Hah! We know who we are.

339
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,955
Ask her who she is
and what she's a-doin' here.

340
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,833
Yeah!
What are you and who are you doin'?

341
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,045
What are you... Who are you, my dear?

342
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,714
Oh, how silly of me. I'm Snow White.

343
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,591
-Snow White?
-The Princess?

344
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,800
Yes.

345
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:46,347
Well... Well, my,
my dear Quincess... Princess.

346
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:48,891
We're, we're honoured.
Yes, we're, we're...

347
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,019
-Mad as hornets!
-Mad as hornets! No, no, we're not.

348
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,856
We're bad as cornets...
No, no, as bad as... What was I sayin'?

349
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,150
Nothing! Just standin' there
sputterin' like a doodlebug!

350
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,945
Who, who, who,
who's butterin' like a spoodledug?

351
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,823
-Who's... Gutter...
-Shut up and tell her to get out!

352
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,409
Please don't send me away!

353
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,578
-If you do, she'll kill me.
-Kill you?

354
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,829
-Who will?
-Yes, who?

355
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,915
-My stepmother, the Queen.
-The Queen?

356
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,541
-She's wicked!
-She's bad!

357
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,711
-She's mighty mean!
-She's an old witch!

358
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm warnin' ya.

359
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,298
If the Queen finds her here,

360
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,843
she'll swoop down
and wreak her vengeance on us!

361
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,513
But she doesn't know where I am!

362
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,516
She don't, eh? She knows everything.

363
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,185
She's full of black magic.

364
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,355
She can even make herself invisible.

365
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,193
Might be in this room right now.

366
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,033
Oh, she'll never find me here.

367
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,662
And if you let me stay,
I'll keep house for you.

368
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,373
I'll wash and sew
and sweep and cook and...

369
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,666
Cook?

370
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,335
Can you make dapple lumpkins...
Lumple dapplins?

371
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,963
-Apple dumplings!
-Eh, yes!

372
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,673
Crapple dumpkins.

373
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,925
Yes, and plum pudding
and gooseberry pie...

374
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,220
Gooseberry pie? Hooray! She stays!

375
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,827
Soup!

376
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,370
Hooray!

377
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,097
Just a minute.

378
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:57,144
Supper's not quite ready.
You'll just have time to wash.

379
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,064
Wash? Wash?

380
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:03,734
-Wash? Wash? Wash?
-Hah! Knew there was a catch to it.

381
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,406
-Why wash?
-What for? We ain't goin' nowhere.

382
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,492
'Tain't New Year's.

383
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,703
Oh, perhaps you have washed.

384
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,413
Perhaps we...

385
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:21,627
-Yes! Perhaps we have.
-But when?

386
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,172
When? When. You said whe...

387
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:30,177
Why, last week. Why, recently!

388
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,431
Yes, recently!

389
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,935
Oh, recently!

390
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,313
Let me see your hands.

391
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,822
Let me see your hands!

392
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,497
Why, Doc, I'm surprised!

393
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,503
Come on, let's see them.

394
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,715
Oh, Bashful, my, my, my!

395
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,634
And you?

396
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,306
Worse than I thought!

397
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,979
How shocking!

398
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,067
Goodness me, this will never do.

399
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:33,198
March straight outside and wash,
or you'll not get a bite to eat.

400
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,695
Well, aren't you going to wash?

401
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,575
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

402
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,421
Did you hurt yourself?

403
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,435
Hah, women!

404
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,231
Courage, men, courage.

405
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,442
Don't be nervous.

406
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,948
Gosh, it's wet!

407
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,618
It's cold, too!

408
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,371
We ain't gonna do it, are we?

409
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,290
Well, it'll please the Princess.

410
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,751
I'll take a chance for her!

411
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,127
Me, too!

412
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,506
Hah! Her wiles are beginnin' to work.

413
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,717
But I'm warnin' ya,
you give 'em an inch,

414
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,011
and they'll walk all over ya!

415
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,598
Don't listen to that old warthog.
Come on now, men.

416
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:24,851
-How hard do ya scrub?
-Will our whiskers shrink?

417
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,270
Do ya get in the tub?

418
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,855
Do ya have to wash
where it doesn't show?

419
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:32,109
Now, now, now, don't get excited.
Here we go.

420
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,028
Steр uр to the tub
'Tain't no disgraсe

421
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,948
Just рull uр your sleeves
and get 'em in рlaсe

422
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,702
Then sсooр uр the water
and rub it on your faсe and go...

423
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,624
Piсk uр the soaр
Now don't try to bluff

424
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,127
Work uр a lather
Аnd when you got enough

425
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:54,339
Get your hands full of water
and you snort and you snuff and go...

426
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,219
You douse and you souse
Rub and you sсrub

427
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,180
You sрutter and sрlash
all over the tub

428
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,058
You may be сold
and wet when you're done

429
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,020
Вut you gotta admit
it's good and сlean fun

430
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,981
So sрlash all you like
'Tain't any triсk

431
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,484
Аs soon as you're through
You'll feel mighty sliсk

432
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,196
Bunch of old nanny goats.
Ya make me sick going...

433
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,422
Hah! Next thing ya know

434
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:38,675
she'll be tyin' your beards up
in pink ribbons

435
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,221
and smellin' ya up with
that stuff called "perfoom."

436
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:13,043
A fine bunch of water lilies
you turned out to be.

437
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:18,131
I'd like to see anybody
make me wash if I didn't wanna.

438
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,581
Get him!

439
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,835
Hey, let go of me!

440
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,546
Get him over to the tub.
Get him over to the tub.

441
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,714
Let me loose, you fools! Let me loose!

442
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,676
Get him up on the tub. Get him up!
Hang on to him! Bang him! Pound him!

443
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,262
Get him up on the tub! On the tub.
That's the tub. That's the tub.

444
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:10,142
Don't, don't, don't, don't get excited!
Don't get... Don't get up... Don't get...

445
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,648
Get the soap!

446
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:29,327
-Hey, steady, men.
-We'll get him there. We'll get him.

447
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,463
Never say die. Never say die.

448
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,047
You don't...

449
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,030
Now, sсrub good and hard
It сan't be denied

450
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,657
That he'll look mighty сute
as soon as he's dried

451
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,828
Well, it's good for the soul
Аnd it's good for the hide to go...

452
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,054
Ain't he sweet?

453
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,890
Smells like a petunia.

454
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,351
He sure is cute!

455
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,729
You'll pay dearly for this!

456
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,564
Supper!

457
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,693
-Supper!
-Food. Hooray!

458
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,740
Hah!

459
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,176
Magic Mirror on the wall,

460
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:11,596
who now is the fairest one of all?

461
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,559
Over the seven jewelled hills

462
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,186
beyond the seventh fall,

463
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,772
in the cottage of the seven dwarfs

464
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,569
dwells Snow White, fairest one of all.

465
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:30,699
Snow White lies dead in the forest.

466
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,451
The Huntsman has brought me proof.

467
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,955
Behold her heart.

468
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,458
Snow White still lives,

469
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,669
the fairest in the land.

470
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,507
'Tis the heart of a pig
you hold in your hand.

471
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,135
The heart of a pig!

472
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,804
Then I've been tricked!

473
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,204
The heart of a pig!

474
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,832
The blundering fool!

475
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,628
I'll go myself to the dwarfs' cottage

476
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,631
in a disguise so complete

477
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,176
no one will ever suspect.

478
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:38,391
Now, a formula to transform
my beauty into ugliness,

479
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,854
change my queenly raiment
to a peddler's cloak.

480
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,609
Mummy dust to make me old.

481
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:52,155
To shroud my clothes,
the black of night.

482
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,914
To age my voice, an old hag's cackle.

483
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,384
To whiten my hair, a scream of fright.

484
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,556
A blast of wind

485
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,102
to fan my hate!

486
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,855
A thunderbolt

487
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,901
to mix it well.

488
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,946
Now,

489
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,075
begin thy magic spell.

490
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:01,766
Look!

491
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,102
My hands!

492
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,443
My voice!

493
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,654
My voice.

494
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,786
A perfect disguise.

495
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,792
And now...

496
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,796
A special sort of death

497
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,466
for one so fair.

498
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,135
What shall it be?

499
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,348
A poisoned apple!

500
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,185
Sleeping Death.

501
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,498
l'd like to danсe and taр my feet

502
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,500
Вut they won't keeр in rhythm

503
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,629
You see, l washed 'em both today
and I сan't do nothin' with 'em

504
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:58,633
Нo-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

505
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,387
lsn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

506
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,067
I...

507
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,284
Oh, gosh!

508
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:33,042
l сhased a рoleсat uр a tree
Way out uрon a limb

509
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:37,255
Аnd when he got the best of me
l got the worst of him

510
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:41,259
Нo-hum, the tune is dumb
The words don't mean a thing

511
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:45,138
lsn't this a silly song
for anyone to sing?

512
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,252
Watch out. Be ca... Watch... Watch...

513
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,338
Watch... Watch...

514
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,759
Thanks.

515
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,307
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

516
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,268
Hey! Hey!

517
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:04,902
Hooray!

518
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,693
That was fun!

519
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:47,528
Now you do something.

520
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,238
Well, what shall I do?

521
00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:52,867
-Tell us a story.
-Yes, tell us a story.

522
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,953
-A true story.
-A love story.

523
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:00,041
Well, once there was a princess.

524
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,710
Was the princess you?

525
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,880
-And she fell in love.
-Was it hard to do?

526
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,174
Oh, it was very easy.

527
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,511
Anyone could see that the Prince
was charming.

528
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,721
The only one for me.

529
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,390
Was he strong and handsome?

530
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,226
Was he big and tall?

531
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,063
There's nobody like him
anywhere at all.

532
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,190
Did he say he loved ya?

533
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:26,317
Did he steal a kiss?

534
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,570
Нe was so romantiс

535
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:34,575
I сould not resist

536
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:49,841
Some daу mу рrince will come

00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:55,680

Аnd away to his сastle we'll go

539
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,732
To be haррy forever

540
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,943
I know

541
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,238
Hah! Mush!

542
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:18,286
Some daу when sрring is here

543
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:24,458
We'll find our love anew

544
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:30,131
Аnd the birds will sing

545
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:35,970
Аnd wedding bells will ring

546
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:42,894
Some daу when mу dreams

00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:46,939
Сome true

548
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,537
Oh, my goodness!

549
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,539
It's past bedtime.

550
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:05,625
Go right upstairs to bed.

551
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,254
Wait! Hold on there, men!

552
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:16,344
The Princess will sleep
in our beds upstairs.

553
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,970
But where will you sleep?

554
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:22,850
Oh, we'll be quite comfortable
down here in...in...

555
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,101
In a pig's eye!

556
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:27,355
In a pig's eye... Sty. No, no! I mean...

557
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,149
We'll be comfortable, won't we, men?

558
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:33,319
Oh, yes. Mighty comfortable.

559
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,322
Now don't you worry about us.

560
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:41,452
-We'll be all right, ma'am.
-Go right on up now, my dear.

561
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,788
Well, if you insist.

562
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,333
Good night.

563
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,293
Good night, Princess.

564
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,257
You're sure you'll be comfortable?

565
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:57,635
Oh, yes. Very comfortable.

566
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,721
Well, pleasant dreams.

567
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,724
Pleasant dreams.

568
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:09,939
Let go!

569
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,857
-I saw it first!
-Now, men, don't get excited.

570
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,277
Remember, share.
It's share and share alike.

571
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,696
Look out, it'll rip. It'll rip!

572
01:00:31,003 --> 01:00:34,547
Bless the seven little men
who have been so kind to me.

573
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:39,093
And... And may my dreams come true.

574
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:40,845
Amen.

575
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,266
Oh, yes!
And please make Grumpy like me.

576
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,102
Hah! Women!

577
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:56,444
A fine kettle of fish!

578
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:43,217
Dip the apple in the brew.

579
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,680
Let the Sleeping Death seep through!

580
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,402
Look! On the skin!

581
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:05,573
The symbol of what lies within.

582
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:10,911
Now, turn red to tempt Snow White.

583
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,747
To make her hunger for a bite.

584
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,669
Have a bite?

585
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,883
It's not for you.

586
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,260
It's for Snow White.

587
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,014
When she breaks the tender peel

588
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,850
to taste the apple in my hand,

589
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,687
her breath will still, her blood congeal.

590
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:40,608
Then I'll be fairest in the land!

591
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,862
But wait!

592
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:48,782
There may be an antidote.

593
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,035
Nothing must be overlooked.

594
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,873
Oh, here it is!

595
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:08,636
"Love's First Kiss."

596
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,473
No fear of that.

597
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,434
The dwarfs will think she's dead.

598
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,063
She'll be buried alive!

599
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,118
Buried alive!

600
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,173
Thirsty?

601
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,342
Have a drink!

602
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,571
Now, don't forget, my dear.

603
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,324
The... The old Queen's a sly one,

604
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,451
full of witchcraft.

605
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,745
So beware of strangers.

606
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:00,914
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

607
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,085
See you tonight.

608
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,923
Yes. We... Well, c'mon, men.

609
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,096
Be awful careful

610
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:19,933
'cause if anything'd happen to you, I, I...

611
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:24,188
-Good-bye.
-Oh, gosh!

612
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,192
Hah! Disgustin'!

613
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:31,904
And be sure to watch out...
To wa... To wa...

614
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,530
To wa...

615
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,366
Watch out.

616
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,077
Thanks.

617
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,608
Well... All right.

618
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,530
But that's the last... Wha...

619
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,117
Oh, go on. Run along.

620
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:23,956
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho

Good-bye! Good-bye!

623
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:35,718
Now I'm warnin' ya.
Don't let nobody or nothin' in the house.

624
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,054
Why, Grumpy, you do care.

625
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,679
Good-bye, Grumpy!

626
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,651
The little men will be away

627
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:37,279
and she'll be all alone

628
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:41,325
with a harmless old peddler woman.

629
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,830
A harmless old peddler woman!

630
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:01,720
Some daу mу рrince will come

631
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:07,476

Some daу when sрring is here

01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:30,082
We'll find our love anew

636
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:34,753
Аnd the birds will sing

637
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:40,217
Аnd wedding bells will ring

640
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,776
All alone, my pet?

641
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:01,405
Why, why, yes, I am. But...

642
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,117
The, the little men are not here?

643
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,245
No, they're not, but...

644
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,417
Making pies?

645
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,378
Yes, gooseberry pies.

646
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,714
It's apple pies

647
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:22,092
that make the menfolks' mouths water.

648
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:27,472
Pies made from apples like these.

649
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,561
-Oh, they do look delicious.
-Yes!

650
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,106
But wait 'til you taste one, dearie.

651
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,487
Like to try one?

652
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,993
Go on. Go on, have a bite.

653
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,337
Stop it! Stop it! Go away! Go away!

654
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,298
Shame on you,
frightening a poor old lady.

655
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:05,010
Oh, I thought I'd lost it.

656
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,806
There, there. I'm sorry.

657
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:12,809
Oh! My heart!

658
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,854
Oh, my... My poor heart.

659
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,816
Take me into the house and let me rest.

660
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:23,028
A drink of water, please.

661
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,018
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho

662
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:59,356
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho
lt's off to work we go

663
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,694
Нeigh-ho, heigh-ho

664
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:20,085
Hey, look!

665
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,343
-Stop that!
-Get away, boy. Get away! Go on, shoo!

666
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,262
Go on! Get outta here!

667
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,436
What ails these crazy birds?

668
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:39,688
They've gone plumb daffy.

669
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,606
Yeah, they've...

670
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:51,533
And because you've been
so good to poor old Granny,

671
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,745
I'll share a secret with you.

672
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,414
This is no ordinary apple.

673
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:00,125
It's a magic wishing apple.

674
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,961
A wishing apple?

675
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,421
Yes!

676
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:09,468
One bite and all your dreams
will come true.

677
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,554
-Really?
-Yes, girlie.

678
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,724
Now, make a wish

679
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,143
and take a bite.

680
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,896
-Go on, get!
-These pesky critters won't stop.

681
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,647
-'Tain't natural.
-There's something wrong.

682
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,609
They ain't actin' this way for nothin'.

683
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,488
Maybe the old Queen's
got Snow White.

684
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,281
-The Queen!
-Snow White!

685
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,784
The Queen'll kill her!
We gotta save her!

686
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,328
Yes! Yes! We, we, we gotta save her!

687
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:37,871
-She'll kill her!
-What'll we do?

688
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:40,165
Yes, yes, what'll we do?

689
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:43,502
Come on! Giddap!

690
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,430
Wait for me! Wait for...

691
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:13,865
There must be something
your little heart desires.

692
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:17,327
Perhaps there's someone you love.

693
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,913
Well, there is someone.

694
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,374
I thought so. I thought so!

695
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,254
Old Granny knows a young girl's heart.

696
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,215
Now, take the apple, dearie,

697
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,883
and make a wish.

698
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,805
I wish... I wish...

699
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,182
That's it, go on! Go on.

700
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,907
And that he will carry me away
to his castle

701
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,287
where we will live happily ever after.

702
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,331
Fine! Fine! Now take a bite.

703
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,005
Don't let the wish grow cold!

704
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,759
Oh, I feel strange.

705
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,848
-Her breath will still.
-Oh. Oh.

706
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,227
-Her blood congeal.
-Oh.

707
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:38,575
