1
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,067
Towels.

2
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,640
Lord Miraz?

3
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,143
You have a son.

4
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,107
The heavens have blessed us.

5
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,112
You know your orders.

6
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,660
General Glozelle?

7
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,790
Yes, my lord.

8
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,617
Five more minutes.

9
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,578
Won't be watching
the stars tonight, my prince.

10
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,664
Come. We must hurry.

11
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,003
- Professor, what's going on?
- Yeur aunt has given birth...

12
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,548
...to a son.

13
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,221
Come.

14
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,107
Yeu must make for the woods.

15
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,568
- The woods?
- They won't follow you there.

16
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,324
It has taken me
many years to find this.

17
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,495
Do not use it except
at your greatest need.

18
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,789
Will I ever see you again?

19
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,834
I dearly hope so' my prince.

20
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,755
There is so much more
I meant to tell you.

21
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,508
Everything you know
is about to change.

22
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,636
Close the drawbridge!

23
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,763
Now' go.

24
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,771
- Halt!
- Halt!

25
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,872
A son! A son!

26
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:54,502
Lady Prunaprismia has this night
given Lord Miraz a son!

27
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,475
Which of you superstitious old women
wants to spend the night in a cell?

28
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,317
He's seen us.

29
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,000
Take care of him.

30
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,675
No!

31
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,016
- Mind yourself' love.
- I'm sorry.

32
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,809
Watch where you're going!

33
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,561
Wait for me!

34
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,285
Yeu go to Saint Finbar's?

35
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,578
That's right.

36
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,040
I go to Hendon House.
Across the road.

37
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,626
I've seen you...

38
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,670
...sitting by yourself.

39
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,801
Yes' well' I prefer to be left alone.

40
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,722
Me' too.

41
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,891
What's your name?

42
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,270
- Phyllis.
- Susan!

43
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,608
Yeu'd better come quickly.

44
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,030
Paper here!

45
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,741
Get your daily paper!

46
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,613
Edmund!

47
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,159
Go on! Kick him in the face!

48
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,758
Stop it. Break it up.
That's enough. Come on.

49
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,970
That's it. Get up.

50
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,306
Act your age!

51
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,026
- Yeu're welcome.
- I had it sorted.

52
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,154
What was it this time?

53
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,741
- He bumped me.
- So you hit him?

54
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,245
No. After he bumped me'
they tried to make me apologize.

55
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,039
- That's when I hit him.
- Really?

56
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,250
- Is it that hard just to walk away?
- I shouldn't have to.

57
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,462
I mean' don't you ever get tired
of being treated like a kid?

58
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,088
We are kids.

59
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,049
Well' I wasn't always.

60
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,177
It's been a year.

61
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,638
How long does he expect us to wait?

62
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,350
I think it's time to accept
that we live here.

63
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,852
It's no use pretending any difterent.

64
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
Oh' no.

65
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,028
- Pretend you're talking to me.
- We are talking to you.

66
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,116
- Ouiet' Lu.
- Something pinched me!

67
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,701
- Stop pulling!
- Not touching you.

68
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:46,038
Look' would all of you just...
What is that?

69
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,457
- It feels like magic.
- Everyone hold hands.

70
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,542
- I'm not holding your hand!
- Just...

71
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,027
Shame you're not as quick as me' Ed!

72
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,447
Last one in's a rotten egg.

73
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,656
Watch out!

74
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,993
Here it comes!

75
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,003
Wait a minute!

76
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,467
Come on' Susan. Hurry up!

77
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,094
Come on' it's lovely.

78
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,681
Edmund.

79
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,311
Ed? Ed!

80
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,444
- What is it?
- Where do you suppose we are?

81
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,404
Well' where do you think?

82
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,324
Well' I don't remember
any ruins in Narnia.

83
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,379
Wonder who lived here.

84
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,097
I think we did.

85
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,982
Hey, that's mine.

86
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,484
- From my chess set.
- Which chess set?

87
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,029
I didn't exactly have a solid gold
chess set in Finchley, did I?

88
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,078
Can't be.

89
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,421
- Don't you see?
- What?

90
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,632
Imagine walls.

91
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,262
And columns' there.

92
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,227
And a glass roof.

93
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,195
Cair Paravel.

94
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,068
Wait. Wait' my lord.
It is not what you think.

95
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,403
Then what is it?

96
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,322
We're not exactly sure.

97
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,621
Impossible.

98
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:51,551
I warned this council when it
put its trust in Lord Miraz...

99
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,138
- ...there would be consequences.
- No.

100
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,100
We can't accuse
the Lord Protector without proof.

101
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,269
How long are we going
to hide behind that excuse?

102
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,523
Until every chair
in this chamber is empty?

103
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,778
Lords of the council'
my apologies for being late.

104
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,614
I wasn't aware we were in session.

105
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,784
No doubt you were otherwise occupied.

106
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,996
My lord?

107
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,875
Ever since the death
of Caspian the ninth'

108
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,337
you've behaved
as if you were king.

109
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,633
Now it seems that from behind his walls
even Prince Caspian has gone missing.

110
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,637
My deepest condolences' Lord Miraz.

111
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,307
Imagine' losing your nephew'

112
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,810
the rightful heir to the throne'

113
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,480
on the very night your wife
has blessed you with a son.

114
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,234
Thank you' Lord Sopespian.

115
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,654
Yeur compassion is a boon
in this troubled time.

116
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,408
I trust you can tell us how such
a tragedy could have occurred.

117
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,417
That is the most
disturbing news of all.

118
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:14,843
Our beloved Caspian was abducted...

119
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,307
...by Narnians.

120
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,351
Yeu go too far, Miraz.

121
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:28,106
Expect us to stand by while you blame
such a blatant crime on fairy tales?

122
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,072
What?

123
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,954
We forget' my lords'
Narnia was once a savage land.

124
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,291
Fierce creatures roamed free.

125
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,338
Much of our forefathers' blood was shed

126
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,965
to exterminate this vermin.

127
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,307
Or so we thought.

128
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,394
But while we've been bickering
amongst ourselves...

129
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,734
...they've been breeding
like cockroaches under a rock!

130
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,488
Growing stronger. Watching us.

131
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,535
Waiting to strike!

132
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,001
And you wonder why we don't like you.

133
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,131
Well' I intend to strike back.

134
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,971
Even if I have to cut down
the entire forest'

135
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:45,058
I assure you'
I will find Prince Caspian

136
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:49,312
and finish what our ancestors began.

137
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,416
- Catapults.
- What?

138
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,880
This didn't just happen.
Cair Paravel was attacked.

139
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,638
Don't suppose you have
any matches' do you?

140
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,974
No' but...

141
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,560
...would this help?

142
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,480
Yeu might have mentioned that
a bit sooner.

143
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,400
I can't believe it.
It's all still here.

144
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,457
I was so tall.

145
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,584
Well' you were older then.

146
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,464
As opposed to hundreds of years
later... when you're younger.

147
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,772
- What is it?
- My horn.

148
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:41,317
I must've left it on my saddle
the day we went back.

149
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,384
When Aslan bares his teeth'
winter meets its death.

150
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,888
When he shakes his mane...

151
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,475
...we shall have spring again.

152
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:22,817
Everyone we knew...
Mr. Tumnus and the Beavers...

153
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,821
...they're all gone.

154
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,623
I think it's time we found out
what's going on.

155
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,721
He won't stop staring.

156
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,765
So don't look.

157
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,780
Here's far enough.

158
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,374
Drop him!

159
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,793
Crows and crockery!

160
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,171
"Drop him"!

161
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,259
That's the best
you can come up with?

162
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,428
A simple "thank you" would suftice.

163
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,431
They were doing fine
drowning me without your help.

164
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,224
Maybe we should have let them.

165
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,394
Why were they trying
to kill you' anyway?

166
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,982
They're Talmarines.
That's what they do.

167
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,277
Talmarines? In Narnia?

168
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,488
Where have you been
for the last few hundred years?

169
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,116
It's a bit of a long story.

170
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,503
Oh' you've got to be kidding me.

171
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,798
Yeu're it?

172
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,843
Yeu're the kings and queens of old?

173
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,680
High King Peter, the Magnificent.

174
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,892
Yeu probably could've
left oft the last bit.

175
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,978
Probably.

176
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,398
Yeu might be surprised.

177
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeu don't want to do that' boy.

178
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,447
Not me. Him.

179
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,216
Edmund!

180
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,094
Yeu all right?

181
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,032
Beards and bedsteads!

182
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,952
Maybe that horn worked after all.

183
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,079
What horn?

184
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,727
This bread is so stale.

185
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,230
I'll just get him some soup.
He should be coming around soon.

186
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,566
I don't think
I hit him hard enough.

187
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,359
Nikabrik' he's just a boy.

188
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:37,822
He's a Talmarine' not some lost puppy.
Yeu said you were gonna get rid of him.

189
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,409
No. I said I'd take care of him.

190
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,787
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.

191
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,790
It would be like murdering a guest.

192
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,251
How do you think his friends
are treating their guest?

193
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,880
Trumpkin knew what he was doing.
It's not the boy's fault.

194
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,802
Stop! Stop!

195
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,597
Hold it. No' no!

196
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,683
I told you we should have killed him
when we had the chance.

197
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:09,020
- Yeu know why we can't.
- If we're taking a vote' I'm with him.

198
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,189
We can't let him go. He's seen us.

199
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,815
That's enough' Nikabrik!

200
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,068
Or do I have to sit on your head again?

201
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,405
And you. Look what you made me do.

202
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,742
I spent half the morning on that soup.

203
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,953
What are you?

204
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,290
Yeu know' it's funny
that you would ask that.

205
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,793
Yeu think people would know
a badger when they saw one.

206
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,419
No. No' I mean...

207
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,216
...you're Narnians.
Yeu're supposed to be extinct.

208
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,551
Sorry to disappoint you.

209
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,266
Here you go. Still hot.

210
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,812
Since when did we open a boarding house
for Talmarine soldiers?

211
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,188
I'm not a soldier.

212
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:56,901
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.

213
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,071
What are you doing here?

214
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,783
Running away.

215
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,706
My uncle has always wanted my throne.

216
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,003
I suppose I have only lived this long

217
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,714
because he did not have
an heir of his own.

218
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:25,680
- Well' that changes things.
- Yeah.

219
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,015
Means we don't have
to kill you ourselves.

220
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,393
Yeu're right.

221
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,606
- Where are you going?
- My uncle won't stop until I am dead.

222
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:39,277
But you can't leave.
Yeu're meant to save us.

223
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,905
Don't you know what this is?

224
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,768
Yeu have quite a library, doctor.

225
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,692
Is there anything particular
you seek' my lord?

226
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,279
I think I've already found
what I'm looking for...

227
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,159
...in one of my soldiers!

228
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,056
What do you know
of Oueen Susan's horn?

229
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,434
It was said to be magic.

230
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,186
Magic?

231
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,358
The Narnians believed it could summon
their kings and queens of old.

232
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:04,487
At least' such was the superstition.

233
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:11,619
And what does Caspian
know of this superstition?

234
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:16,874
My lord' you forbade me
from mentioning the old tales.

235
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,003
So I did.

236
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:32,807
I will say this. If Caspian
does know of the Deep Magic'

237
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,227
my lord would have
good reason to be nervous.

238
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,910
First our prince...

239
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,329
...now his tutor.

240
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,624
If the members of Miraz's
own house are not safe'

241
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:02,003
- are any of us?
- Lord Sopespian!

242
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,047
Those are dangerous words'
Lord Sopespian.

243
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,925
But these are
dangerous times' general.

244
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:12,972
One should choose his words
as carefully as he chooses his friends.

245
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,105
How long until the bridge is finished?

246
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,650
- Construction continues on schedule.
- That's not good enough.

247
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,028
I need my army across that river now.

248
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,197
May I suggest you contribute
some of your own men?

249
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,491
I've only so many at my disposal.

250
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,037
A fact you'd be wise to remember.

251
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,749
Go to Beruna.

252
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:44,170
Take as many troops as you need.
We must get to Caspian before they do.

253
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,797
"They," my lord?

254
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,634
It's time you learned your history.

255
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,956
They're so still.

256
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,712
They're trees. What'd you expect?

257
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,549
They used to dance.

258
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,680
Wasn't long after you left
that the Talmarines invaded.

259
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,600
Those who survived
retreated to the woods.

260
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,103
And the trees'

261
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:46,857
they retreated so deep into themselves
that they haven't been heard from since.

262
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,945
I don't understand.
How could Aslan have let this happen?

263
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,363
Aslan?

264
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,700
Thought he abandoned us
when you lot did.

265
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,832
We didn't mean to leave' you know.

266
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,544
Makes no difterence now' does it?

267
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,046
Get us to the Narnians...

268
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,173
...and it will.

269
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,045
Hello' there.

270
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,012
It's all right. We're friends.

271
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,936
Don't move' Yeur Majesty.

272
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,945
Stay away from her!

273
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,659
Shoot' Susan! Shoot!

274
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,511
- Why wouldn't he stop?
- I suspect he was hungry.

275
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,527
Thanks.

276
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,240
He was wild.

277
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,035
I don't think he could talk at all.

278
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,914
Get treated like
a dumb animal long enough'

279
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,958
that's what you become.

280
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,505
Yeu may find Narnia a more savage place
than you remember.

281
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,692
I can hear you.

282
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,656
I just think we should wait
for the kings and queens.

283
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,619
Fine! Go then! See if the others
will be as understanding!

284
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,204
Or maybe I'll come with you.

285
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,915
I want to see you
explain things to the minotaurs.

286
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,710
Minotaurs?

287
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,296
They're real?

288
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,839
And very bad-tempered.

289
00:36:56,923 --> 00:37:00,259
- Yeah' not to mention big.
- Huge.

290
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,471
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?

291
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,516
Well' the centaurs will
probably fight on your side.

292
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:10,686
But there's no telling
what the others will do.

293
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,148
What about Aslan?

294
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,156
How do you know so much about us?

295
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,909
- Stories.
- Wait a minute.

296
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,661
Yeur father told you
stories about Narnia?

297
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,164
No' my professor, he...

298
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,500
Listen' I'm sorry.

299
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:37,421
These are not the kind of questions
you should be asking.

300
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,176
- What is it?
- Human.

301
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,929
- Him?
- No. Them.

302
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,643
- There they are!
- Run!

303
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,573
Now!

304
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,251
- Oh' no.
- Wait. I'll go.

305
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,802
Take it. Go!
It's more important than I am.

306
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,004
Get him out of here.

307
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,765
Where are you?

308
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:31,577
Choose your last words
carefully, Talmarine.

309
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,288
Yeu are a mouse.

310
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,876
I was hoping for something
a little more original.

311
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,335
Pick up your sword.

312
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,132
No' thanks.

313
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,469
Pick it up! I will not fight
an unarmed man.

314
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,596
Which is why I might live longer

315
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,474
if I choose not to cross blades
with you' noble mouse.

316
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,102
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!

317
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,812
Reepicheep!

318
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,023
- Stay your blade!
- Truftlehunter?

319
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:05,152
I trust you have a very good reason
for this untimely interruption.

320
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,697
- He doesn't. Go ahead.
- He's the one who blew the horn.

321
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,744
- What?
- Then let him bring it forward.

322
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,209
This is the reason we have gathered.

323
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,174
I don't remember this way.

324
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,469
That's the problem with girls.
Yeu can't carry a map in your heads.

325
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,680
That's because our heads
have something in them.

326
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:37,351
I wish he'd just listen
to the D.L.F. in the first place.

327
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,562
- D.L.F.?
- Dear Little Friend.

328
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,275
Oh' that's not at all
patronizing' is it?

329
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,572
I'm not lost.

330
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:51,782
No.

331
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,869
Yeu're just going the wrong way.

332
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,413
Yeu last saw Caspian
at the Shuddering Woods'

333
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,458
and the quickest way there
is to cross at the river Rush.

334
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,878
But unless I'm mistaken'
there's no crossing in these parts.

335
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,006
That explains it' then.
Yeu're mistaken.

336
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,741
Yeu see' over time' water erodes
the earth's soil' carving deeper...

337
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,451
Oh' shut up.

338
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:39,746
- Is there a way down?
- Yeah' falling.

339
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,749
Well' we weren't lost.

340
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,003
There's a ford near Beruna.
How do you feel about swimming?

341
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,130
I'd rather that than walking.

342
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,841
Aslan?

343
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,303
It's Aslan!
It's Aslan over there!

344
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,847
Don't you see? He's right...

345
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,227
...there.

346
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,272
Do you see him now?

347
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,317
I'm not crazy.

348
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,195
He was there.
He wanted us to follow him.

349
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,242
I'm sure there are any number
of lions in this wood.

350
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,370
- Just like that bear.
- I think I know Aslan when I see him.

351
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,291
Look' I'm not about
to jump oft a clift

352
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,501
after someone who doesn't exist.

353
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,962
The last time I didn't believe Lucy

354
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,506
I ended up looking pretty stupid.

355
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,223
Why wouldn't I have seen him?

356
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,642
Maybe you weren't looking.

357
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,937
I'm sorry, Lu.

358
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,215
Kill him!

359
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,008
- Talmarine!
- Liar!

360
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,386
Murderer!

361
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,681
All this horn proves is they've stolen
yet another thing from us!

362
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,684
- I didn't steal anything.
- Didn't steal anything?

363
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,561
Shall we list the things
the Talmarines have taken?

364
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,272
- Our homes!
- Our land!

365
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,649
- Our freedom!
- Our lives!

366
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,858
Yeu stole Narnia!

367
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,237
Yeu would hold me accountable
for all the crimes of my people?

368
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,738
Accountable...

369
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,199
...and punishable.

370
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,703
That is rich coming from you' dwarf.

371
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,832
Have you forgotten it was your people
who fought alongside the White Witch?

372
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,711
And I'd gladly do it again'
if it would rid us of these barbarians.

373
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:54,298
Then it's lucky that it is not
in your power to bring her back.

374
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,844
Or are you suggesting that we ask
this boy to go against Aslan now?

375
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,809
Some of you may have forgotten'
but we badgers remember well'

376
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:10,564
that Narnia was never right
except when a Son of Adam was king.

377
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,567
He's a Talmarine!
Why would we want him as our king?

378
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,527
Because I can help you.

379
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,405
- It's a trick!
- At least hear him out!

380
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,075
Beyond these woods' I'm a prince.

381
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,746
The Talmarine throne
is rightfully mine!

382
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,083
Help me claim it'
and I can bring peace between us.

383
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:35,339
It is true. The time is ripe.

384
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,759
I watch the skies'

385
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:43,472
for it is mine to watch
as it is yours to remember, badger.

386
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:50,062
Tarva' the lord of victory,
and Alambil' the lady of peace'

387
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,190
have come together
in the high heavens.

388
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,904
And now here'
a Son of Adam has come forth...

389
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,200
...to ofter us back our freedom.

390
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,453
Is this possible? Do you really
think there could be peace?

391
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,164
Do you? I mean' really?

392
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:14,336
Two days ago' I didn't believe
in the existence of talking animals...

393
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,214
...or dwarves... or centaurs.

394
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,968
Yet here you are
in strength and numbers

395
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:25,138
that we Talmarines
could never have imagined.

396
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:30,560
Whether this horn is magic or not'
it brought us together.

397
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,355
And together,

398
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,149
we have a chance
to take back what is ours.

399
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:42,697
If you will lead us'
then my sons and I...

400
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,576
...ofter you our swords.

401
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,298
And we ofter you our lives'
unreservedly.

402
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:05,720
Miraz's army will not
be far behind us' sire.

403
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:10,851
If we are to be ready for them' we need
to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.

404
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:17,190
I'm sure they will be here soon.

405
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,704
These ones!
And these ones!

406
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,959
Timber!

407
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,296
- Get back!
- Watch your back!

408
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,174
Look out!

409
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,595
- Steady, steady!
- Timber!

410
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:07,115
Perhaps this wasn't the best way
to come after all.

411
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,480
So where exactly
do you think you saw Aslan?

412
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:44,152
I wish you'd all stop trying
to sound like grown-ups.

413
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,531
I don't think I saw him'
I did see him.

414
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,367
I am a grown-up.

415
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,370
It was right over...

416
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,205
Lucy!

417
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,545
...here.

418
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,930
Lucy, are you awake?

419
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,980
Why do you think I didn't see Aslan?

420
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,154
Yeu believe me?

421
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:12,157
Well' we got across the gorge.

422
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,911
I don't know.

423
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,333
Maybe you didn't really want to.

424
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,006
Yeu always knew we'd be
coming back here' didn't you?

425
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,383
I hoped so.

426
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:39,309
I finally just got used
to the idea of being in England.

427
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,811
But you're happy
to be here' aren't you?

428
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,815
While it lasts.

429
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:57,864
Lucy.

430
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,500
Aslan!

431
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,346
I've missed you so much!

432
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,477
- Yeu've grown.
- Every year you grow...

433
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,604
...so shall I.

434
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:35,777
Where have you been?
Why haven't you come to help us?

435
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,989
Things never happen
the same way twice' dear one.

436
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,833
Susan! Wake up!

437
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,839
Certainly, Lu.
Whatever you like.

438
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,196
Wake up.

439
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,006
Aslan?

440
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,254
No' stop!

441
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,362
Prince Caspian?

442
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,073
Yes? And who are you?

443
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,158
Peter!

444
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:00,213
- High King Peter.
- I believe you called.

445
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,800
Well' yes' but...
I thought you'd be older.

446
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:07,428
If you like' we could
come back in a few years...

447
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,432
No. No' that's all right.
Yeu're just...

448
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,477
Yeu're not exactly what I expected.

449
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,815
Neither are you.

450
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,069
A common enemy unites
even the oldest of foes.

451
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:27,407
We have anxiously awaited
your return' my liege.

452
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,742
Our hearts and swords
are at your service.

453
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,619
Oh' my gosh' he is so cute.

454
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:35,123
- Who said that?
- Sorry.

455
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:40,003
Yeur Majesty, with the greatest respect'

456
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:43,589
I do believe "courageous"'
"courteous"' or "chivalrous"

457
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,842
might more befit a knight of Narnia.

458
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:49,095
Well' at least we know some of you
can handle a blade.

459
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,181
Yes' indeed. And I have
recently put it to good use'

460
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,308
securing weapons for your army, sire.

461
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:58,646
Good. Because we're going
to need every sword we can get.

462
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:02,233
Well' then' you will probably
be wanting yours back.

463
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,797
How much did they take?

464
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,341
Enough weapons and armor
for two regiments.

465
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:30,803
But... there's more.

466
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:37,226
"Yeu were right to fear the woods."

467
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:41,981
- "X"?
- Caspian. The tenth.

468
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,735
I apologize' my lord.
The blame is mine.

469
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,403
I know.

470
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,573
Tall me' general...

471
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,993
...how many men did you lose?

472
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,705
- None' my lord.
- None?

473
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,960
They came like ghosts'
in the dead of night. We never saw them.

474
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,632
Then how do you explain your injuries?

475
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,018
I asked...

476
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,354
...how many men were killed

477
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,191
during this bloody Narnian attack?

478
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:30,947
Of which you were a fortunate survivor.

479
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,451
General...

480
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,121
...how many?

481
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,762
Three.

482
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,773
I apologize' Lord Sopespian.

483
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:11,737
Caspian is not a victim
of this savage uprising.

484
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,364
He is the instigator.

485
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,706
It seems Narnia is in need
of a new king.

486
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,176
Well' it's good you have troops'

487
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,971
but we need some fortifications.
Somewhere to train.

488
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,187
So? What are they like?

489
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:49,442
Malcontents' complainers'
stubborn as mules in the morning.

490
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,485
So you like them' then.

491
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,572
Well enough.

492
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:17,780
It may not be what you are used to'
but it is defensible.

493
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,741
Peter. Yeu may want to see this.

494
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,259
It's us.

495
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,680
What is this place?

496
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,725
Yeu don't know?

497
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,532
He must know what he's doing.

498
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,582
I think it's up to us now.

499
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,034
It's only a matter of time.

500
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,038
Miraz's men and war machines
are on their way.

501
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,917
That means those same men
aren't protecting his castle.

502
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,711
What do you propose we do'
Yeur Majesty?

503
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,464
- We need to get ready for it.
- To start planning for...

504
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:29,763
Our only hope is to strike them
before they strike us.

505
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,640
Crazy. No one has taken that castle.

506
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:35,227
- There's always a first time.
- We'll have the element of surprise.

507
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,230
- But we have the advantage here!
- If we dig in'

508
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,192
we could probably
hold them oft indefinitely.

509
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,905
I' for one' feel safer underground.

510
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,116
Look. I appreciate
what you've done here'

511
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:51,744
but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb.

512
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,412
Yes. And if they're smart'

513
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:56,332
the Talmarines will just wait
and starve us out.

514
01:03:56,416 --> 01:04:00,252
- We could collect nuts!
- Yes! And throw them at the Talmarines.

515
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,463
Shut up!

516
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,507
I think you know where I stand' sire.

517
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:13,182
If I get your troops in'
can you handle the guards?

518
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:20,773
Or die trying' my liege.

519
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:24,735
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Sorry?

520
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,448
Yeu're all acting like
there's only two options.

521
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,076
Dying here' or dying there.

522
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,955
- I'm not sure you've been listening.
- No' you're not listening.

523
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:39,291
Or have you forgotten who really
defeated the White Witch' Peter?

524
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,547
I think we've waited
for Aslan long enough.

525
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,491
Professor?

526
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,267
- I have to find him.
- Yeu don't have time.

527
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:11,230
- Yeu need to get the gate open.
- Yeu wouldn't be here without him.

528
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,731
And neither would I.

529
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,612
Yeu and I can deal with Miraz.

530
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,864
And I can still get
to the gate in time.

531
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:48,559
Yes' I'm a mouse.

532
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:12,499
We were expecting someone'
you know' taller.

533
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:16,211
- Yeu're one to talk.
- Is that supposed to be irony?

534
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,763
Five more minutes?

535
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:30,601
What are you doing here?

536
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:35,939
I didn't help you escape
just so you could break back in.

537
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,525
Yeu have to get out

538
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,028
before Miraz learns you're here.

539
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,946
He's going to learn soon enough.

540
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,616
We are giving him your cell.

541
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,954
Don't underestimate Miraz
as your father did.

542
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,583
What are you talking about?

543
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:57,753
I'm sorry.

544
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:19,399
Thank goodness you're safe.

545
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,817
Get up.

546
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,950
- Caspian?
- Stay where you are.

547
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:31,578
- What are you doing?
- I should think it's obvious' dear.

548
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:35,666
Yeu know' some families might
consider this inappropriate behavior.

549
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,918
That doesn't seem to have stopped you!

550
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,170
But you are not like me' are you?

551
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:45,842
It's sad. The first time
you've shown any backbone...

552
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,344
...and it's such a waste.

553
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,433
Put the sword down' Caspian.

554
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:58,397
- I don't want to do this.
- We don't want you to either.

555
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,112
This used to be a private room.

556
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,448
What are you doing?
Yeu're supposed to be in the gatehouse!

557
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,700
No!

558
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:13,537
Tonight for once' I want the truth.

559
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,040
Did you kill my father?

560
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,547
Now we get to it.

561
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,717
Yeu said your brother died in his sleep.

562
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,719
That was more or less true.

563
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,972
Caspian' this won't
make things any better.

564
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:35,058
We Talmarines would have
nothing had we not taken it.

565
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:37,394
Yeur father knew that
as well as anyone.

566
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,813
How could you?

567
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,399
For the same reason
you will pull that trigger.

568
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,569
- For our son.
- Stop!

569
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:48,488
- Stay right there.
- Yeu need to make a choice' dear.

570
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:50,866
Do you want our child to be king?

571
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,910
Or do you want him
to be like Caspian here?

572
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,666
- Fatherless!
- No!

573
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,710
Caspian!

574
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,992
What's that supposed to mean?

575
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:39,539
- We're under attack!
- Sound the alarm!

576
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:42,584
Men! Grab your bows!

577
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:50,133
- Peter!
- Our troops are just outside! Come on!

578
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,306
Now' Ed! Now!

579
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,850
- Signal the troops!
- I'm a bit busy, Pete!

580
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,835
Peter! It's too late.
We have to call it oft while we can.

581
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,711
No' I can still do this!

582
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:29,798
Help me!

583
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:50,861
Exactly who are you
doing this for, Peter?

584
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,242
Come on!

585
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,753
Charge!

586
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:16,219
We're under attack!

587
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:24,436
Attack! Attack!

588
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,247
For Narnia!

589
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,997
Archers!

590
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,292
Pick a target!

591
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:32,837
Take aim!

592
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,472
Ed!

593
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:46,453
Get that gate closed.

594
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:41,508
Fall back!

595
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:49,766
We need to retreat! Now!

596
01:18:52,311 --> 01:18:54,479
Go! Get her out of here!

597
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,857
Back to the gate! Go!

598
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:07,033
- Caspian!
- I'll find him!

599
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:11,162
Go! Get out! Go!
Get out! Retreat!

600
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:17,836
Follow me!

601
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,913
Give the order.

602
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:58,001
My men are still down there.

603
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:01,337
Draw back!
Get out! Retreat!

604
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,342
Now!

605
01:20:10,264 --> 01:20:11,890
Fire!

606
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,582
Run for your life!
Save yourself!

607
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,723
Peter! The bridge!

608
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,574
Leave us! Go' brothers!

609
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:15,703
In the name of Aslan!

610
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,805
What happened?

611
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:17,640
Ask him.

612
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,727
- Peter.
- Me?

613
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,438
Yeu could've called it oft.
There was still time.

614
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,189
No' there wasn't' thanks to you.

615
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:28,067
If you kept to the plan'
those soldiers might be alive.

616
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,945
If you'd stayed here like I suggested'
they definitely would be!

617
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:34,949
- Yeu called us' remember?
- My first mistake.

618
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:38,411
No. Yeur first mistake was thinking
you could lead these people.

619
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:45,084
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.

620
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:49,589
Yeu invaded Narnia. Yeu have no more
right to lead it than Miraz does.

621
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,382
Yeu' him' your father...

622
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:54,802
Narnia's better oft
without the lot of you.

623
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,013
Stop it!

624
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,807
What are you all standing around for?

625
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:45,687
Talmarines will be here soon enough.

626
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,068
Thank you...
my dear little friend.

627
01:23:57,783 --> 01:24:02,412
- Well done' lads.
- Move it faster, mate. Too slow!

628
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,757
Beruna pledges its troops.

629
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:18,720
Galma pledges its troops.

630
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,681
Tashbaan pledges its troops.

631
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:25,435
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.

632
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:59,135
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

633
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,705
Are you so glad
of that magic horn now' boy?

634
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:33,085
Yeur kings and queens have failed us.

635
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:38,508
Yeur army's half dead. And those
that aren't will be soon enough.

636
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,512
What do you want?
Congratulations?

637
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,725
Yeu want your uncle's blood.
So do we.

638
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:52,814
Yeu want his throne?
We can get it for you.

639
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:14,502
Yeu tried one ancient power.
It failed.

640
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:17,713
But there is a power greater still.

641
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:22,552
One that kept even Aslan at bay
for near a hundred years.

642
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,776
Who's there?

643
01:26:39,862 --> 01:26:41,445
I am hunger.

644
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:46,367
I am thirst.

645
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,705
I can fast a hundred years...

646
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,416
...and not die.

647
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:57,086
I can lie a hundred nights
on the ice...

648
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,589
...and not freeze.

649
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:05,595
I can drink a river of blood
and not burst.

650
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:10,600
Show me... your enemies!

651
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:15,855
What you hate' so will we.

652
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,691
No one hates better than us.

653
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:26,908
And you can...
guarantee Miraz's death?

654
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:29,785
And more.

655
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,550
Let the circle be drawn.

656
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:56,872
Wait.

657
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,211
This isn't what I wanted.

658
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:09,885
One drop of Adam's blood
and you free me.

659
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,221
Then I am yours' my king.

660
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,432
No!

661
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,747
Stop!

662
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,665
Come on! Come.

663
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,210
Get away from him!

664
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:31,133
Peter, dear.

665
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:33,511
I've missed you.

666
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,139
Come.

667
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,517
Just one drop.

668
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,480
Yeu know you can't do this alone.

669
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:18,347
I know. Yeu had it sorted.

670
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,231
Why did you never tell me
about my father?

671
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:16,822
My mother was a Black Dwarf
from the Northern Mountains.

672
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:21,577
I risked my life all these years

673
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:25,331
so that one day...

674
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:29,418
...you might be a better king
than those before you.

675
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,423
Then I have failed you.

676
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:42,848
Everything I told you'
everything I didn't'

677
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:46,810
it was only because I believe in you.

678
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:52,858
Yeu have a chance to become the most
noble contradiction in history.

679
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:59,490
The Talmarine who saved Narnia.

680
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,141
Yeu're lucky, you know.

681
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,979
What do you mean?

682
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,440
To have seen him.

683
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:39,822
I wish he'd just given me
some sort of proof.

684
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,911
Maybe we're the ones who need
to prove ourselves to him.

685
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,794
Pete. Yeu'd better come quickly.

686
01:34:56,733 --> 01:35:00,402
Cakes and kettledrums.
That's your next big plan?

687
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:05,991
Sending a little girl into the darkest
parts of the forest? Alone!

688
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:10,037
- It's our only chance.
- And she won't be alone.

689
01:35:12,082 --> 01:35:15,876
Haven't enough of us died already?

690
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:20,381
Nikabrik was my friend too.
But he lost hope.

691
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:24,134
Oueen Lucy hasn't.
And neither have I.

692
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,678
For Aslan.

693
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,806
For Aslan!

694
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:37,356
- Then I'm going with you.
- No. We need you here.

695
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,359
We have to hold them oft
until Lucy and Susan get back.

696
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,986
If I may...

697
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:51,787
Miraz may be a tyrant
and a murderer...

698
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:58,335
...but as king' he is
subject to the traditions...

699
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:02,256
...and expectations of his people.

700
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:06,135
There is one in particular
that may buy us some time.

701
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,104
Perhaps they intend to surrender.

702
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,647
No.

703
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:23,652
They are much too noble for that.

704
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:30,409
"I' Peter, by the gift of Aslan'
by election and by conquest'

705
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:35,664
High King of Narnia' Lord of Cair
Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands'

706
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:38,876
in order to prevent
the abominable eftusion of blood'

707
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,547
do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to
single combat upon the field of battle.

708
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:48,760
The fight shall be to the death.
The reward shall be total surrender."

709
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:54,099
- Tall me' Prince Edmund...
- King.

710
01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:59,396
- Pardon me?
- It's King Edmund' actually.

711
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:02,149
Just "King"' though.
Peter's the high king.

712
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:05,027
I know' it's confusing.

713
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:10,491
Why would we risk such a proposal

714
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:13,994
when our armies could
wipe you out by nightfall?

715
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:17,998
Haven't you already
underestimated our numbers?

716
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:23,670
I mean' only a week ago
Narnians were extinct.

717
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,964
And so you will be again.

718
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:28,300
Well' then you should have
little to fear.

719
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,304
This is not a question of bravery.

720
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:36,058
So you're bravely refusing
to fight a swordsman half your age?

721
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:41,271
I didn't say I refused.

722
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:43,815
Yeu shall have our support'
Yeur Majesty.

723
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,651
Whatever your decision.

724
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:50,739
Sire' our military advantage alone
provides the perfect excuse to avoid

725
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:53,867
- what might otherwise be...
- I'm not avoiding anything!

726
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,120
I was merely pointing out

727
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,998
that my lord is well
within his rights to refuse.

728
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:02,626
His Majesty would never refuse.

729
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,421
He relishes the chance
to show the people

730
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,757
the courage of their new king.

731
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:15,055
Yeu.

732
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:23,605
Yeu should hope your brother's sword
is sharper than his pen.

733
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:32,698
Destrier has always served me well.
Yeu are in good hands.

734
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:34,449
Or hooves.

735
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:43,333
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

736
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:48,964
Look.

737
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:53,468
Maybe it is time you had this back.

738
01:38:55,972 --> 01:39:00,475
Why don't you hold on to it.
Yeu might need to call me again.

739
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:11,612
- Yeu might need to call me again?
- Oh' shut up.

740
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,702
If it should appear
to be going poorly...

741
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,668
Understood' Yeur Majesty.

742
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:25,352
I hope you won't be too disappointed
when I survive.

743
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,427
There is still time to surrender.

744
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,681
Well' feel free.

745
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:05,267
How many more must die for the throne?

746
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:07,811
Just one.

747
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:35,964
- Ride!
- They've seen us!

748
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:53,064
- Take the reins.
- What are you doing?

749
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:57,861
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if
you'll be going alone after all.

750
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:17,399
Are you sure you don't need that horn?

751
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:37,228
Does His Highness need a respite?

752
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:38,939
Five minutes?

753
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:41,441
Three!

754
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,629
Lucy?

755
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:06,091
She got through... with a little help.

756
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:09,094
- Thanks.
- Well' you were busy.

757
01:45:09,178 --> 01:45:13,848
I assume you won't let things
get that close again!

758
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:22,107
Yeu better get up there.
Just in case.

759
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:24,651
I don't expect the Talmarines
will keep their word.

760
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:31,950
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

761
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:33,576
Be careful.

762
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:36,413
Keep smiling.

763
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,094
How does he look to you?

764
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,096
Yeung.

765
01:45:55,808 --> 01:46:00,186
But His Majesty's doing
extremely well... for his age.

766
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:10,071
I think it's dislocated.

767
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:18,079
What do you think happens
back home if you die here?

768
01:46:22,168 --> 01:46:25,211
Yeu know you've always been there'
and I never really...

769
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,632
Save it for later.

770
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:20,326
Respite!

771
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:25,331
Respite.

772
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:28,501
Now's not the time for chivalry, Peter!

773
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:31,045
Show no mercy!

774
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:53,610
Look out!

775
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:21,971
What's the matter, boy?

776
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:25,266
Too cowardly to take a life?

777
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:31,439
It's not mine to take.

778
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:16,276
Perhaps I was wrong.

779
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:21,823
Maybe you do have the makings
of a Talmarine king after all.

780
01:50:35,421 --> 01:50:37,505
Not one like you.

781
01:50:46,807 --> 01:50:49,726
Keep your life.

782
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:53,313
But I am giving the Narnians
back their kingdom.

783
01:51:24,386 --> 01:51:25,636
My king.

784
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:33,227
I'll deal with you when this is over.

785
01:51:34,063 --> 01:51:37,065
It is over.

786
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:55,833
Treachery! They shot him!

787
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:58,336
They murdered our king!

788
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:01,172
Be ready!

789
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:04,133
Peter!

790
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:12,517
Go!

791
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:22,860
To arms' Talmar!

792
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:24,737
To arms!

793
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:29,909
Loose!

794
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:56,936
Cavalry!

795
01:52:58,856 --> 01:53:02,692
Attack!

796
01:53:19,168 --> 01:53:21,502
Archers to the ready!

797
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:47,028
Narnians!

798
01:53:47,112 --> 01:53:50,364
Charge!

799
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:14,805
One' two...

800
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:17,350
Three' four...

801
01:54:17,434 --> 01:54:20,269
Five' six...

802
01:54:22,648 --> 01:54:24,065
Take your aim!

803
01:54:25,817 --> 01:54:27,235
Stay with them!

804
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:32,657
Eight' nine...

805
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,784
Get ready!

806
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,079
Now!

807
01:55:00,269 --> 01:55:03,104
Stop! Back! Back!

808
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:07,358
Hold it now! Hold it!

809
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:11,571
Now!

810
01:55:27,296 --> 01:55:44,186
Charge!

811
01:56:11,298 --> 01:56:12,965
Yeu're a mouse.

812
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,426
Yeu people have no imagination.

813
01:56:44,206 --> 01:56:45,956
Move it!

814
01:56:46,041 --> 01:56:47,875
Loose! Loose!

815
01:56:55,926 --> 01:56:57,510
Lucy?

816
01:57:06,395 --> 01:57:07,937
Back to the How!

817
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:14,694
Cut oft their escape!

818
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:19,907
Loose!

819
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:30,459
Brace yourselves!

820
01:58:21,136 --> 01:58:22,803
Crush them all.

821
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:34,708
Aslan!

822
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:47,596
I knew it was you.
The whole time' I knew it.

823
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:49,890
But the others didn't believe me.

824
01:59:49,975 --> 01:59:52,434
And why would that stop you
from coming to me?

825
01:59:55,272 --> 01:59:58,148
I'm sorry. I was too scared
to come alone.

826
02:00:00,068 --> 02:00:02,111
Why wouldn't you show yourself?

827
02:00:02,195 --> 02:00:05,406
Why couldn't you come roaring in
and save us like last time?

828
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:09,076
Things never happen
the same way twice' dear one.

829
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:19,253
If I'd have come earlier, would everyone
who died... could I have stopped that?

830
02:00:21,256 --> 02:00:24,341
We can never know
what would have happened' Lucy.

831
02:00:24,426 --> 02:00:28,679
But what will happen
is another matter entirely.

832
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:31,223
- Yeu mean you'll help?
- Of course.

833
02:00:31,308 --> 02:00:34,935
- As will you.
- Oh' I wish I was braver.

834
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:37,897
If you were any braver,
you'd be a lioness.

835
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:43,027
Now' I think your friends
have slept long enough' don't you?

836
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:17,061
Come on!

837
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:22,167
Lucy.

838
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:50,821
For Aslan!

839
02:02:56,244 --> 02:02:59,121
We can defeat them
if we draw them to the river.

840
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:02,166
We must regroup. To Beruna!

841
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:04,293
To the bridge!

842
02:04:02,227 --> 02:04:03,977
Charge!

843
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:34,925
What is happening?

844
02:04:35,009 --> 02:04:37,970
- The river!
- Retreat!

845
02:04:38,054 --> 02:04:40,055
Back! Back!

846
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,744
Come on.

847
02:06:12,357 --> 02:06:14,775
Assemble on that bank!

848
02:06:16,027 --> 02:06:18,278
Yeu will not be harmed!

849
02:06:19,948 --> 02:06:22,282
Surrender your weapons!

850
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:25,452
Take oft the armor!

851
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:46,056
Rise' kings and queens of Narnia.

852
02:06:49,644 --> 02:06:50,978
All of you.

853
02:06:56,567 --> 02:06:58,485
I do not think I am ready.

854
02:06:58,569 --> 02:07:01,863
It's for that very reason
I know you are.

855
02:07:50,204 --> 02:07:52,956
Thank you' Yeur Majesty.

856
02:07:53,041 --> 02:07:55,208
Thank you.

857
02:07:57,253 --> 02:08:02,215
Hail' Aslan!
It is a great honor to be in...

858
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:08,889
I'm completely out of countenance.

859
02:08:08,973 --> 02:08:12,851
I must crave your indulgence
for appearing in this unseemly fashion.

860
02:08:14,729 --> 02:08:16,772
Perhaps a drop more?

861
02:08:16,856 --> 02:08:19,900
- I don't think it does that.
- Yeu could have a go.

862
02:08:21,277 --> 02:08:22,986
It becomes you well' small one.

863
02:08:23,071 --> 02:08:25,906
All the same' great king'

864
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:31,453
I regret that I must withdraw' for a
tail is the honor and glory of a mouse.

865
02:08:31,537 --> 02:08:34,998
Perhaps you think too much
of your honor, friend.

866
02:08:35,083 --> 02:08:39,961
Well' it's not just the honor.
It's also great for balance.

867
02:08:40,046 --> 02:08:43,590
And climbing.
And grabbing things.

868
02:08:43,674 --> 02:08:47,010
May it please Yeur High Majesty,
we will not bear the shame

869
02:08:47,095 --> 02:08:50,097
of wearing an honor denied to our chief.

870
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:53,100
Not for the sake of your dignity,

871
02:08:53,684 --> 02:08:55,936
but for the love of your people.

872
02:09:01,943 --> 02:09:06,446
Look! Thank you' my liege.
I will treasure it always.

873
02:09:06,531 --> 02:09:11,284
From this day forward it will serve
as a great reminder of my huge humility.

874
02:09:13,287 --> 02:09:17,374
Now' where is this dear little friend
you've told me so much about?

875
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,646
Do you see him now?

876
02:10:44,545 --> 02:10:47,464
Because you have snuck in...

877
02:10:47,548 --> 02:10:50,675
I'm sorry, but their future
in that world shall be good.

878
02:10:51,636 --> 02:10:53,720
Yeur Majesty?

879
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:06,858
We are ready.
Everyone has assembled.

880
02:11:16,202 --> 02:11:20,580
Narnia belongs to the Narnians'
just as it does to man.

881
02:11:20,665 --> 02:11:24,918
Any Talmarines who want to stay
and live in peace are welcome to.

882
02:11:25,002 --> 02:11:27,337
But for any of you who wish'

883
02:11:27,421 --> 02:11:31,049
Aslan will return you
to the home of our forefathers.

884
02:11:31,133 --> 02:11:34,177
It's been generations
since we left Talmar.

885
02:11:34,262 --> 02:11:36,638
We're not referring to Talmar.

886
02:11:36,722 --> 02:11:39,391
Yeur ancestors were seafaring brigands.

887
02:11:39,475 --> 02:11:42,185
Pirates run aground on an island.

888
02:11:42,270 --> 02:11:47,357
There they found a cave' a rare chasm
that brought them here from their world.

889
02:11:47,441 --> 02:11:50,235
The same world as our kings and queens.

890
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:55,198
It is to that island I can return you.

891
02:11:55,283 --> 02:11:59,286
It is a good place for any
who wish to make a new start.

892
02:12:01,414 --> 02:12:02,539
I will go.

893
02:12:04,834 --> 02:12:06,459
I will accept the ofter.

894
02:12:14,302 --> 02:12:15,969
So will we.

895
02:12:20,308 --> 02:12:26,146
Because you have spoken first'
your future in that world shall be good.

896
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:11,024
- Where did they go?
- They killed them.

897
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:14,819
How do we know he is not
leading us to our death?

898
02:13:14,904 --> 02:13:18,448
Sire. If my example
can be of any service'

899
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:21,368
I will take 11 mice through
with no delay.

900
02:13:28,459 --> 02:13:32,379
- We'll go.
- We will?

901
02:13:32,463 --> 02:13:35,674
Come on. Our time's up.

902
02:13:37,134 --> 02:13:39,052
After all...

903
02:13:40,471 --> 02:13:43,056
...we're not really
needed here anymore.

904
02:13:47,478 --> 02:13:49,938
I will look after it until you return.

905
02:13:50,022 --> 02:13:52,065
I'm afraid that's just it.

906
02:13:54,068 --> 02:13:55,819
We're not coming back.

907
02:13:58,989 --> 02:13:59,989
We're not?

908
02:14:00,866 --> 02:14:02,158
Yeu two are.

909
02:14:03,411 --> 02:14:07,080
At least' I think he means you two.

910
02:14:07,998 --> 02:14:09,958
But why?

911
02:14:10,042 --> 02:14:13,294
- Did they do something wrong?
- Ouite the opposite' dear one.

912
02:14:13,379 --> 02:14:15,338
But all things have their time.

913
02:14:15,423 --> 02:14:18,842
Yeur brother and sister have learned
what they can from this world.

914
02:14:18,926 --> 02:14:21,594
Now it's time for them
to live in their own.

915
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:25,598
It's all right' Lu.

916
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:29,978
It's not how I thought it would be...

917
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:32,439
...but it's all right.

918
02:14:32,523 --> 02:14:36,234
One day you'll see' too.
Come on.

919
02:15:10,478 --> 02:15:12,520
I'm glad I came back.

920
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:15,982
I wish we had more time together.

921
02:15:18,486 --> 02:15:20,820
It would never have worked' anyway.

922
02:15:20,905 --> 02:15:22,572
Why not?

923
02:15:22,656 --> 02:15:25,325
I am 1 '300 years older than you.

924
02:15:45,846 --> 02:15:49,015
I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand.

925
02:15:50,059 --> 02:15:53,019
I'm older and don't think
I want to understand.

926
02:17:10,598 --> 02:17:13,099
Aren't you coming' Phyllis?

927
02:17:23,402 --> 02:17:26,195
Yeu don't think there's
any way we can get back?
