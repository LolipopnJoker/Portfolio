Is it the penthouse?
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,634
Welcome to another

78
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:29,300
"Lifestyles of the
average and anxious "

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,208
We move about the apartment

80
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,917
Young architect about town.

81
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:37,717
It's his late 30's,

82
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,875
Or is it his early 40's...

83
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,208
We'll never know...

84
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:42,342
Birthday party.

85
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:46,166
Entranced by the
euphoria and ease...

86
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,883
These glamorous
people exude!

87
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:53,041

birthday boy, himself!

88
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,841

You're looking

90
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:02,083

Rebecca davidson.

92
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,759
The public wants to know...

What an attractive,
successful woman,

94
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,800
Sees in a bozo,
like my roommate.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,125
Well, he's uh...
charming and he's sweet.

96
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:16,467
He's very thoughtful.

97
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,750
He's sort of boyishly
handsome, but...

98
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,175
He has got the
most amazing...

99
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,300

100
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,083

106
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,125

00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:48,604
You two still
together?

112
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:50,917
Yeah, for
5 years now.

113
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,500
Tight as ever.

114
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:02,509
Ã¢â„¢âª true love ã¢â„¢âª

They old.
Real old.

117
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,875
One of them's a
senator now.

118
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,750
Oh, god, no!

119
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,425
Real old!

120
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,050
Can i talk to

121
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,217
I'm not doing
commercials, anymore.

122
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,166
No more talking t-Bones,
or cowboys with heartburn.

123
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,792
I'm only doing
serious stuff.

124
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:22,813
Hi.

125
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:23,634
Jack!

126
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,467
Angela... phew!

127
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:26,834
You look
different.

128
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:28,583
I'm dressed.

129
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,333
That's it!

130
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,750
Gentlemen,
i'm in love.

131
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,841
You?
Yeah.

132
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,667
In a generic
sense.

133
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,800
Right.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,671
So many women...

135
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,542
So little time.

136
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,550
So, jack...

137
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,875
You're not really going
to do this movie in turkey?

138
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,050
Yes, i am.

139
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,675
I leave in a
few short hours.

140
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,333
What is it?
"Zalmon the beautician?"

141
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,342
"Zalmon the
barbarian."

142
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,709
What about the play in
soho you wanted to do?

143
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,675
Excuse me.

144
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,667
You said it was a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

145
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,875
You want my inevitably
brilliant reviews,

146
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,550
Or next
month's rent?

147
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,750
Forget about next month's rent.
Do the play.

148
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,675
That's
sweet of you.

149
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,083
You are a very
decent man.

150
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:34,896
I'm a
goddamn saint.

151
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:36,509
"Saint" is
a bit much.

152
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,609
Hey, how's it
going, baby?

153
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,709
Name's johnny.
Give me five.

154
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,333
I mean,
give me three.

155
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,175
Yeah,
yeah.

156
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,583
I can't believe you
draw "johnny cool."

157
00:07:49,783 --> 00:07:51,291
Coolest cat
in the world, right?

158
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:53,342
No one
cooler, baby.

159
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:57,500
I can't believe it.
It makes me so happy.

160
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,342
What's wrong?

161
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,500
David. The guy you
broke up with?

162
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,458
The good looking one.

163
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:05,217
Incredibly good looking.

164
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,875
He used to read me
"johnny cool" every morning.

165
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,258
Hey, hey.
Poor baby.

166
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,250
Know how to get
over a lover?

167
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,792
Dance with a stranger.

168
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,509
David's an
incredible dancer.

169
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,625
He studied 3 years
with the joffrey ballet.

170
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,759
3 years?

171
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,625
Joffrey ballet?

172
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,925
You guys will
get back together.

173
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,458
Could i call him and
invite him to the party?

174
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,125
Uh, yeah.

175
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,175
Twins!

176
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,041
There it is!

177
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,258
Yeah!

178
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,875
One of the best
clutch shots of all time.

179
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,250
Nobody played
better than...

180
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,425
Reed, west,
chamberlain, baylor.

181
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,500
I'll run it for you
again in slow motion.

182
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,834
People are
asking for you.

183
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,383
Let's go mingle.

184
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,792
"Mingle" sounds like something
sea lions do before mating.

185
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:23,375
You are the guest of honor.
They love you.

186
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:25,834
But these guys need me.
Don't you?

187
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,166
No.
Go on.

188
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,792
Wait, there it is.

189
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,509
Yeah!

190
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:37,041
The greatest clutch shot
in basketball history.

191
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,875
Unarguably.

192
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,709
The best.

193
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,759
Paul, listen.

194
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,504
You are my friend
and a great director,

195
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,250
But i'm not doing
commercials ever again.

196
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,959
I don't want you
to do a commercial.

197
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,834
I need a favor.

198
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,509
All right, shoot.

199
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,171
I'm having a package
delivered tomorrow,

200
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:01,085
But i'm going to san
francisco on a shoot.

201
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:04,000
You're going to
shoot in san francisco?

202
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,625
Who are
you using?

203
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,008
Len peters.

204
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,583
Didn't you like my last
dog food commercial?

205
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:12,925
That was a classic.

206
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,750
Could i have this
package delivered here?

207
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,008
Sure, no problem.

208
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,258
Let me ask
you something.

209
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,858
Do you think i'm
overexposed?

210
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:25,258
Overexposed?
No, not at all.

211
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,583
It'll be delivered tomorrow
and picked up thursday.

212
00:10:29,783 --> 00:10:31,500
Tomorrow; picked
up thursday.

213
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,417
This is a
delicate matter.

214
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,250
Don't mention it.

215
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,592
All right.

216
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:43,250
Ã¢â„¢âª happy birthday,
dear peter ã¢â„¢âª

217
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,250
Ã¢â„¢âª happy birthday to you ã¢â„¢âª

218
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,959
Speech!
Speech!

219
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,583
Oh, uh...

220
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,217
First of all,

221
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:07,088
I want to thank jack and
michael and rebecca...

222
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:10,959
For embarrassing me with
this flow of sentiment.

223
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,133
Awww.

224
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,504
Thanks for coming.

225
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,875
All right.
All right.

226
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,125
i think everybody
had a great time.

227
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:28,875
i sure did.

228
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,709
Why don't you stick
around a while?

229
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,542
I thought sentiment
made you uncomfortable.

230
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,258
I can handle it,

231
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,667
As long as it's
disguised as sex.

232
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,000
Stay tonight.

233
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,709
I can't.

234
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,166
I have to be up at 7 am
for a pretrial meeting.

235
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,166
Happy birthday,
peter.

236
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,834
Mmmm.

237
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:18,834
Yeah, right.

238
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,917
It was a
great party.

239
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,709
You know,
in this light...

240
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,883
You're kind
of ugly.

241
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,583
That rut in the middle
of your forehead...

242
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,342
Is getting
out of hand.

243
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,425
Why does that
happen to you?

244
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,675
As soon as you get
a woman in your room,

245
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,546
You turn into her brother
and solve her problems.

246
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:51,417
Unlike you, and our sexually
insatiable roommate,

247
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,342
I'm a sensitive guy.

248
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,400
I have more on my mind
than pronging chicks.

249
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,458
What's a good year
for pronging chicks?

250
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,917
The '82 bordeaux
works every time.

251
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:03,896
Thank you
very much.

252
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:05,760
Did somebody
die here?

253
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,425
Rebecca
left early.

254
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,583
Michael saved another
doomed relationship.

255
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,509
Post-Party
depression.

256
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,129
I'm out of here tomorrow,
for 10 weeks.

257
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,550
What do you say i
get rid of cherise,

258
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,375
We hunker down with a
bottle of wine and shoot pool?

259
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,425
I got a
better idea.

260
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,750
You two hunker
down, and i'll...

261
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,217
No, no, no.

262
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,417
Just go have
a good time.

263
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,217
Enjoy yourself.

264
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,917
Tough job, but
it's gotta be done.

265
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,425
He's
unbelievable.

266
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,000
The man is
one giant gland.

267
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:51,717
Jack?
Jack?

268
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:54,004
he left already,
cherise.

269
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:56,291
I think he
took my mousse.

270
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,125
That's our boy.

271
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,542
Thanks, peter.

272
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:00,959
See you
around.

273
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,717
Yeah.

274
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,050
it's me, jack.

275
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,792
I'm at the airport, but
i forgot to tell you something.

276
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:12,008
A package is going
to be delivered today.

277
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,316
Some guys will pick it up
thursday before noon.

278
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:16,425
Just put it aside,
and don't worry about it.

279
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,625
It's a very delicate matter,
so don't tell anybody.

280
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:23,500
I'll bring you back
something from turkey.

281
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,300
Maybe a drumstick.

282
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,875
See you later.
Bye-Bye.

283
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,462
Hi, harry.

284
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:41,750
Morning, sir.

285
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,133
Michael?

286
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,834
Get out here.

287
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,800
What is it?

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,834
Just get out here.

289
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,709
What?

290
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,566
What's going on?

291
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,550
I don't know. What?

292
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,917
Oh, okay.
Just look in the hall.

293
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,175
Yeah?

294
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:29,667
Just look out
in the hall.

295
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,083
Okay.

296
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,383
That's a baby.

297
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,941
I know
it's a baby.

298
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:41,500
What's it
doing there?

299
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,133
It's sleeping.

300
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,208
Who do you suppose
it belongs to?

301
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:49,291
Peter, there's a note.

302
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,375
All right,
i'll just play along.

303
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,375
"Dear jack, here is our baby."

304
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,509
Oh, no.

305
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,133
You really don't know
anything about this?

306
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,417
I knew this would happen
to him sooner or later.

307
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,875
"I can't handle this.
I don't know where to turn."

308
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:14,841
Right.

309
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,959
"Someday i hope you
can both forgive me.

310
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,041
Her name is mary.
Love, sylvia."

311
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,509
Who's sylvia?

312
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,917
You need a secretary to
keep track of all his women.

313
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,458
He left a message
about a package...

314
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:28,592
Being delivered today.

315
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,875
He said to put it aside
and not worry about it.

316
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:31,800
He said that
about a baby?

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He takes procreation
a little lightly.

318
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,208
What are we
supposed to do?

319
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:37,666
Pick it up.

320
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:38,925
You pick it up.

321
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,542
I'm not picking it up!

322
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:41,250
You found it!

323
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,337
One of us has
to pick it up.

324
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:51,375
It's not
going to be me.

325
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,583
I don't know
anything about babies.

326
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,050
Neither do i.

327
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,792
We've got to do something.
Be my guest.

328
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,709
It's not my
responsibility.

329
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,125
It's not mine,
either.

330
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,342
Don't yell
at me!

331
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,254
It can't be
that difficult.

332
00:17:14,454 --> 00:17:15,814
Just feed it.
It'll shut up.

333
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,375
I don't know
what babies eat!

334
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:18,759
Soft stuff.

335
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,550
We were babies once.
What did we eat?

336
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,375
It couldn't have been
very good; i can't remember.

337
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,966
Wait!
Where are you going?

338
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:33,375
To get baby food. We can't
feed it cake and goat cheese.

339
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:34,500
What am i supposed to do?

340
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,146
Entertain it.

341
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,792
"Entertain it!"

342
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,792
How do you
entertain a baby?

343
00:17:44,992 --> 00:17:47,425
Hey, junior.

344
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,000
Look at my hands.

345
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,509
Look at this.

346
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,504
It's a glass; a prism.

347
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,502
Look at those colors.

348
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,500
This is nice;
expensive.

349
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,083
You don't like that.

350
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:01,467
How about... oh, look.

351
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,750
It's almost like
japanese origami!

352
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,125
It's a bird!
It's a bird!

353
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:07,875
No, huh?

354
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,133
I'm getting
a headache.

355
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,000
You're giving
me a headache.

356
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,771
How about this?

357
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,342
A hairy chest!

358
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,125
Like that?
You want one of these?

359
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,966
Excuse me.

360
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,875
Where can i get
a jar of baby food?

361
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,333
3rd aisle
to the right.

362
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,125
Right.

363
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,175
They gotta
be kidding.

364
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,775
what's happening, baby?

365
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,970
How you doing today?

366
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,966
My name is johnny.

367
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,959
That's right, but you
can call me mr. Cool.

368
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,175
What's your name?

369
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,667
Haven't i seen you
around the neighborhood?

370
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:02,958
What's the matter?

371
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:04,541
Cat got your tongue?

372
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,125
Why can't you talk?

373
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,917
Come on, kid.
I'm doing my best.

374
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,717
Excuse me.

375
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,133
Is this a good meal
for a baby?

376
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,083
That's for toddlers.
What's a toddler?

377
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:30,258
11/2 to 2 years.

378
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,542
I need something
for a baby.

379
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:33,833
This is
your first?

380
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,041
First what?
Baby.

381
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,050
Yeah.
First and last.

382
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,375
No matter how you prepare,
you're never ready.

383
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:42,258
No, you're not.

384
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,834
What an infant eats...

385
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:45,133
Can you...

386
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,342
Can determine its
entire future.

387
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:51,709
That's fascinating,
but all i need is food.

388
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,717
That's all.

389
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:55,291
What's the best
selling brand?

390
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,291
That white can.

391
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,091
This is the best?

392
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,000
No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells.

393
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,291
How about
this one?

394
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:04,467
That's good,

395
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,750
But it's got
iron in it.

396
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,759
Is that bad?

397
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,467
If your baby's
allergic to it.

398
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,333
How do you know
if she's allergic?

399
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,841
They throw up
all over you.

400
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,333
But they throw up even
if they're not allergic.

401
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:19,792
Some babies can't
hold anything down.

402
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:21,667
What about this one?

403
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,000
That's for older babies.

404
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,333
How old is your baby?

405
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,467
About that old.

406
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,542
You don't know how
old your baby is?

407
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:32,966
Yes i do.

408
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,467
Is she teething?
Teething?

409
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:40,625
Does she cry all night,
chew her fist and drool?

410
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:43,041
All right, i'll
take 3 of these,

411
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,208
And some of these...

412
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,375
Thanks for your time.

413
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,542
You've been a source
of great distress.

414
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:53,791
If she's less than
3 months old,

415
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,041
You've got to
sterilize the nipples.

416
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,959
Here it comes.

417
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,841
Hey!
Look!

418
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,041
I'll give you $10
if you stop crying.

419
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,458
$10 bucks, huh?

420
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,875
I'm going to
pick you up, now.

421
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,208
There you go, jr.

422
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,342
Is that better?

423
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:31,500
How about a
little walk?

424
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,467
Wait a minute.

425
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,883
Okay.
Hey, how about this?

426
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,250
No, we're not going
to keep crying.

427
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,925
No, no, wait.

428
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,217
Ã¢â„¢âª rock-A-Bye baby
on the tree top ã¢â„¢âª

429
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:51,083
Ã¢â„¢âª when the bough breaks
na-Na-Na-Na-Na ã¢â„¢âª

430
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,083
Ã¢â„¢âª something like
laughing... Ã¢â„¢âª

431
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:54,937
Come on!
Where the hell is he?

432
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,792
Milking the cows
or something?

433
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:59,041
Look!
No crying.

434
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:01,091
Hey wait a minute!

435
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,133
You can drive
a guy to drink.

436
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,917
No, not you.
You're a cute little thing.

437
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,383
How about:

438
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,592
Ã¢â„¢âª hush little baby
don't you cry ã¢â„¢âª

439
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:14,417
Ã¢â„¢âª when peter gets home, i'm
gonna punch him in the eye ã¢â„¢âª

440
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,896
All right, here we are.

441
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:19,175
Here we are in my room.

442
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,959
Look around here.
This is nice, huh?

443
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,550
We'll sit down here.

444
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,250
Look!
We're going to watch a little tv.

445
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,917
Yeah, just you and me.

446
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,208
Here you go.

447
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:36,300
Amuse yourself.

448
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,467
Women are wondering,
are they having an orgasm?

449
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,291
men are worried maybe
their penis...

450
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:44,883
Whoa, whoa.

451
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,875
No, you don't
want to hear that.

452
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,917
We'll have a nice conversation
with uncle peter...

453
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:55,041
And let him
have some fun.

454
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,925
That's a good idea.

455
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,625
Where the hell
have you been?

456
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:01,175
Oh, hi,
mrs. Hathaway.

457
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,375
Oh, what a darling
little baby!

458
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:05,717
Is it yours?

459
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,250
No, it's not mine.
Mr. Mitchell's?

460
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,645
No, someone
loaned it to us.

461
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,041
We're watching
her for a while.

462
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,133
What's its name?

463
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,166
Its name is uh,
uh, sylvia.

464
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,258
No, mary, mary.

465
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:23,149
We've had a tough morning,
and we're tuckered out.

466
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:27,041
We have to say good-Bye.
Bye-Bye, mrs. Hathaway.

467
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,759
By the way,

468
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,333
This package just arrived
for you downstairs.

469
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,837
All right,
great.

470
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,689
Could i hold her?

471
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:41,407
I don't think so.

472
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:42,925
I love babies.

473
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,087
Oh, yes.
Tch, tch, tch.

474
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:49,050
I just
love babies.

475
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,083
Unfortunately,
mr. Hathaway and i...

476
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:53,008
Were never able
to have any.

477
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,458
Mr. Hathaway has a
low sperm count.

478
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,841
Some guys have
all the luck.

479
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:02,250
Oh, you are a cute
little bundle, aren't you?

480
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
You do realize
she did a doodle?

481
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,258
Yes, you did.

482
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,792
Would you like me
to change her?

483
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,313
No, i can do it.

484
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:15,634
I'm used to it.

485
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,379
Thanks, we've
got to go now.

486
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:21,125
We're gonna say
bye-Bye, now.

487
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,896
Bye-Bye.

488
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,467
Bye-Bye-Bye.

489
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,583
If you ever need
a baby-Sitter...

490
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:31,291
All right,
thanks.

491
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:33,000
She's a
lovely baby.

492
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,383
Adorable.

493
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,417
This baby hasn't
stopped crying.

494
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,050
She did a doodle.

495
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,759
What the
hell is that?

496
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,713
Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

497
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,667
You're gonna know,
because she did it.

498
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:49,400
I had to go 3 places
and get 4 kinds of formula.

499
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,375
2 kinds of diapers,
bottles, towels, nipples...

500
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,250
You have no idea how
much crap kids need.

501
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,258
How old is she?

502
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,550
You want me to check
her driver's license?

503
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,333
You can tell how old she
is by feeling her teeth.

504
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,312
I'm not feeling
her teeth!

505
00:25:06,512 --> 00:25:08,091
I'm tired of
holding her.

506
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:11,608
I can't hold her
and make her bottle.

507
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:15,125
I'll hold her.
You check the teeth.

508
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,959
Come on!

509
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,316
I can't feel anything.

510
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,425
What's
that mean?

511
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:28,509
She doesn't
have any teeth!

512
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,629
Neither did gabby hayes,
and he was 90.

513
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,750
We'll give her the
stuff for newborns...

514
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,258
And hope she's
not allergic.

515
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,959
You've no idea what
they can be allergic to.

516
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,258
What's that stench?

517
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,175
hold her.

518
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,841
Just hold her.

519
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,920
This is a girl.
Should we be doing this?

520
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,000
Just hold her, so i
can get the diaper off.

521
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,509
Ohh!
Awww!

522
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,754
How could something
so small...

523
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:55,000
Create something
so disgusting?

524
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,854
Beats the shit
out of me.

525
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:58,709
Hand me the
other diaper.

526
00:25:58,909 --> 00:25:59,883
Oh!

527
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,712
Shouldn't we
wash her?

528
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:03,273
We'll wash
her later.

529
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:04,834
Get me
the cotton.

530
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,467
Oh!

531
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,500
Here it is.

532
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,333
Just give me
a little cotton.

533
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,125
I don't need
a package.

534
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:16,917
Get me the
cotton wipies.

535
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,091
This is
disgusting.

536
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,875
It's all over
and it's sticky.

537
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,834
We're going to need some
kind of cleaning fluid.

538
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,217
How about
after-Shave?

539
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,417
Come on, michael,
just get a diaper.

540
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,542
Oh!

541
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,333
Do these tapes go
in front or back?

542
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:47,625
How am i
supposed to know?

543
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,966
These are
way too big!

544
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,625
What size did you get?
They're ultra absorbent.

545
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,146
The more absorbent,
the better!

546
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,467
Hold her!
She's going crazy.

547
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,467
I don't want to.
Come on, michael!

548
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:05,291
You're going to rip it.
I'm not going to rip it.

549
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,008
Yes, you are.

550
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,342
Get me
another diaper.

551
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:12,004
I'll use the tape.
I'll tape it up.

552
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:14,667
I'm an architect,
for christ's sake.

553
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,771
I build 50-Story
skyscrapers.

554
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:18,675
I assemble cities
of the future.

555
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:21,083
I can certainly put
together a goddamn diaper.

556
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:22,458
Take it easy, kid.

557
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,258
There, see?

558
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:31,750
It's working.
A piece of cake.

559
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,883
Yeah.

560
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,917
Nice job, pete.

561
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,667
The little insect
was just waiting...

562
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,937
For that diaper
to fall off.

563
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,208
I think we're
in trouble.

564
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,291
I'm going to
kill jack.

565
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,166
I'm going
to kill him.

566
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,129
This is the deal.

567
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,675
Michael.
What?

568
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,417
You're going to have to
wash where the poop was.

569
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:25,208
Come on.

570
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:26,800
All righty.

571
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You're not getting
anything off that way.

572
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:36,834
There you go.
That's clean.

573
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:38,550
I'll rinse her.

574
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,542
Rinse her
a little bit.

575
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,383
There we go.

576
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,941
This is for
moisturizing...

577
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,470
Don't use the
baby lotion now.

578
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,000
It says,
"prevents chapping."

579
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,425
Just wash her.

580
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,208
I'll put some in
just to make sure.

581
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,175
We gotta get
some help.

582
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:06,417
Jack said this is a
delicate situation,

583
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:08,634
That we shouldn't
tell anybody.

584
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,667
Can you believe him
putting us through hell...

585
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:14,458
To save his
precious reputation?

586
00:30:14,658 --> 00:30:16,333
I'm not doing
it, anymore.

587
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:20,834
Odds.

588
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,709
You're going to
have a headache.

589
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:50,550
Mary, let me
have the pen.

590
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,625
I'm later than usual
for the deadline.

591
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:57,667
Come here.
Okay?

592
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:09,250
Actually, i don't seem
to have them after all.

593
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,625
I must have left
them at the office.

594
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:13,291
I'll get them
in the morning.

595
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,509
Right.

596
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:18,750
Your daddy's
a dead man.

597
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,675
Rebecca you're...

598
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:31,208
I came as soon
as i could.

599
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,634
Who are you?

600
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:36,000
This is jan clopatz;
peter mitchell.

601
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,759
How do you do.

602
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:40,629
Jan is a cellist
from hungary.

603
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,500
He's playing at
carnegie hall.

604
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,217
What a thrill.

605
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:46,983
What's the
emergency?

606
00:32:47,183 --> 00:32:48,750
Just come
with me.

607
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,583
This is the
big emergency.

608
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,717
It's a baby.

609
00:32:57,917 --> 00:33:00,208
Why's that the first
thing everybody says?

610
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:01,417
Of course
it's a baby.

611
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:02,759
It's your baby?

612
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,041
It's not mine.
It's jack's.

613
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:05,883
Jack has
a baby?

614
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,400
I realize that
tends to negate...

615
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,717
Our belief in a
benevolent god.

616
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,941
It doesn't look like jack.
He has more hair.

617
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:15,166
I'm glad you can joke
at a time like this.

618
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:17,249
She needs
to be held.

619
00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,333
Babies like
to be held.

620
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:20,091
Where is he?

621
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,050
Jack's in turkey,

622
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,709
Which is where i'd be
if my baby was in new york.

623
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:26,592
We're dying here.

624
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:29,000
Michael doesn't
know about babies.

625
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,425
I don't know
about babies.

626
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,546
I've got deadlines
hanging all over me.

627
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,667
I've been reading
books about babies.

628
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,634
I can't figure
it out.

629
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,425
It says,
"feed every 2 hours."

630
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:44,008
It takes me 2 hours
to get her to eat.

631
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:48,291
Does it mean 2 hours from
when i start or finish?

632
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:50,959
I've been feeding
her from when i start,

633
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,208
And i'm feeding
her all the time.

634
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,425
Which is it?

635
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,233
Why are you asking me?
You're a woman.

636
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:01,041
That doesn't mean
i know about babies.

637
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,041
Rebecca...

638
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,917
Please stay with me, and
help me take care of her.

639
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:09,792
You want me to
take care of her?

640
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:11,841
Yes.
Now?

641
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:13,000
No, when she
graduates from college.

642
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,258
Yes, now.

643
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,592
I can't do that.

644
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:21,133
Baby take...
very, very much work.

645
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,750
Thanks for telling me.
Is he an idiot savant?

646
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,041
Rebecca, we be late.

647
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,300
Rebecca...

648
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,000
Rebecca,
please.

649
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,133
Stay with me.

650
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,592
I have got
a date!

651
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:45,083
Excuse me for cramping
your romantic style.

652
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,800
Rebecca, we be late!

653
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,675
You can't be
serious about him.

654
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,592
You go out with
other people; so do i.

655
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,917
I don't care if you date
the whole string section.

656
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:58,542
Right now, i need you.
I can't be here now.

657
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:00,208
Oh, she doodled!

658
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:01,717
Doodled.

659
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:03,217
Yes, doodled!

660
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,125
Don't babies
doodle in hungary?

661
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:06,375
We're leaving.

662
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:08,104
Rebecca!

663
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:09,634
Wait.

664
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,375
Come on, rebecca.

665
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:13,008
Don't go.

666
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,275
You're a
very big boy.

667
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:17,342
You're very
capable.

668
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,583
You'll get
through this fine.

669
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,542
I hate the cello!

670
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,166
Don't.

671
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,083
I keep waiting for
"candid camera"...

672
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:36,509
To walk
through the door.

673
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:38,792
What'd you cancel
for tonight?

674
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:41,187
Box seats at shea.
You?

675
00:35:41,387 --> 00:35:43,583
Dinner with
cheryl.

676
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,000
Two more days.

677
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,250
Where'd you put
the baby powder?

678
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,550
I'll get it.

679
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,483
Why'd you put
it there?

680
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:01,366
We're bathing
her in here.

681
00:36:01,566 --> 00:36:03,224
It's just
down the hall.

682
00:36:03,424 --> 00:36:04,883
We don't bathe
her there.

683
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,045
Maybe we should
start, goddamn it!

684
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:11,208
You're going to
clean that up.

685
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:17,125
What time are they
getting here?

686
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:19,008
Before noon.
Good.

687
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:20,542
I see my editor
about 1 pm.

688
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Did you move
my blueprints?

689
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,959
I need them.

690
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,208
Sorry.

691
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,566
I think she
did a doodle.

692
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,966
Your turn to
change her.

693
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,792
I'll give you $1000
if you'll do it.

694
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,250
Coming.

695
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,300
Does jack holden
live here?

696
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,883
Someone asked us to
pick up a package.

697
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:17,258
I love the way everyone
calls it a package.

698
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,208
Tell sylvia she's got a lot of
nerve dumping her problems...

699
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,300
Sylvia?

700
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,834
We considered
calling the cops.

701
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,133
Wait, wait, wait.

702
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,125
... totally
disrupted our lives.

703
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:31,217
We haven't
worked or slept.

704
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,291
There's been shit
all over the place.

705
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:34,333
Shit?

706
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:35,175
What?

707
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,592
The package busted?

708
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,900
Busted?
You could say that.

709
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,008
Did you put
the shit back?

710
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:44,208
No, we had it
bronzed for posterity.

711
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:45,417
Michael.

712
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,542
Her next bottle
is in 45 minutes.

713
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:52,208
It's in the basket.

714
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:54,800
It's a baby.

715
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,467
You're sharp,
aren't you?

716
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,458
20 minutes after eating
she gets tired.

717
00:37:58,658 --> 00:37:59,800
Put her to bed.

718
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,709
I'll get the
powdered milk.

719
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:04,375
Right,
powdered milk.

720
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,133
Yeah,
powdered milk.

721
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,417
We'll take the "powdered milk"
and get out of here.

722
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,087
You want us
to take the baby?

723
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:26,291
That was the
arrangement.

724
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,925
Are you sure?

725
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,583
You're damn
straight.

726
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:34,875
If you say so.

727
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:36,050
Let's go.

728
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,667
You won't forget
what we said?

729
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:39,509
No.

730
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:43,713
She likes to be
rocked to sleep; gently.

731
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:47,717
Gently. Absolutely.
I can handle it.

732
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:51,792
Leave your phone number,
in case you need advice.

733
00:38:51,992 --> 00:38:54,458
I'll call you.

734
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:09,709
Do you hear that, peter?
Just listen.

735
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:12,000
Isn't it
wonderful?

736
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,291
Isn't what
wonderful?

737
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:15,759
Quiet.

738
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,925
Peace and quiet.

739
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,775
Something screwy
is going on.

740
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:22,425
I've got a
funny feeling.

741
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,441
You've been tense
the last 5 days.

742
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:28,458
It's just your
nerves unwinding.

743
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,542
Maybe you're right.

744
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,834
Michael...

745
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,087
What is this?

746
00:39:52,287 --> 00:39:53,383
A package.

747
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,858
When did it
get here?

748
00:39:56,058 --> 00:39:57,991
Sunday.
Mrs. Hathaway...

749
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,016
Go to the window.
Stop them.

750
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:02,041
I'll catch up
with them.

751
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,175
You're beautiful.

752
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,500
Want to go
for a ride?

753
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,709
Hey, up here!

754
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,291
Where will
i put her?

755
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:34,841
On your lap.

756
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,900
We need a
baby car seat.

757
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,759
Put her
in the trunk.

758
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:42,250
You want to ride
in the trunk?

759
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,625
Want to go in
the trunk?

760
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,125
Umph!

761
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,634
Oh, no.

762
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,625
Oh, my god!

763
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:59,375
Want to try this?
It's an adventure.

764
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,091
Why do i
listen to you?

765
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:06,166
It's absurd to put
a baby in the trunk.

766
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,592
Hey!

767
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:12,133
Wonderful.

768
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,649
I gave you
the wrong package.

769
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,179
I made a
terrible mistake.

770
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:19,709
I gave you
the wrong package.

771
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,125
Give me the
baby first.

772
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,375
Give me
the baby!

773
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,917
You're disturbing
the baby.

774
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:26,917
Give me
the baby.

775
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,425
Hey, satch.

776
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,217
This guy's an animal.

777
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,250
I keep him chained
and feed him raw meat.

778
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,300
What's going on?

779
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,125
It's roy
and trigger.

780
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:37,521
What's going on?

781
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:38,717
Nothing, officer.

782
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:42,091
You putting the
kid in the trunk?

783
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,583
No, it's unhealthy
and it's illegal, also.

784
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,091
No, he's not,
officer.

785
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,083
Let me see your
license and registration.

786
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:50,133
Why?

787
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:53,625
You're double-Parked,
wise guy!

788
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,667
All right.
Wait a minute.

789
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,925
Be gentle.

790
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,208
I'll be right
with you.

791
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,709
Come back here!
You, freeze!

792
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,208
I have no
intention of moving.

793
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:15,091
I'm not a criminal.

794
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:17,583
I'm an architect
with a baby, see?

795
00:42:17,783 --> 00:42:20,125
Let me see some i.D.

796
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:23,175
I don't have
any with me.

797
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,921
Up against the
car, spread 'em.

798
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:28,585
My wallet's in
my apartment.

799
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:30,688
You can come up
with me.

800
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:32,592
I'll show you
some i.D.,

801
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:36,208
But i won't spread 'em
because i have a baby.

802
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:38,667
Let's go,
architect.

803
00:42:44,792 --> 00:42:46,217
Here we are.

804
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,171
Can i get you
a cup of coffee?

805
00:42:48,371 --> 00:42:50,125
No thanks.
I'll just wait here.

806
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:52,583
I'll just
be a second.

807
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,258
Here we go.
I'm coming.

808
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,667
The package those
guys came for...

809
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,313
Is full of drugs.

810
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:02,959
What?
Drugs!

811
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,175
Here.

812
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,625
Coming.
Do something with it.

813
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:09,917
Like what?
Hide it!

814
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:13,083
I'm coming.

815
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:16,342
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

816
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:19,333
Remove that from
the cover, please.

817
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:21,383
Sure.

818
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:24,342
Thank you.

819
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:27,816
Shh. Shh.
Shh.

820
00:43:28,016 --> 00:43:31,091
Shhh.
Shhh.

821
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:34,467
Thanks for coming
up, officer.

822
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,333
If there's anything else
i can do, let me know.

823
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,041
I was just
doing my job.

824
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:46,500
I'm detective sergeant
melkowitz, narcotics.

825
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,375
Officer, you can
saddle up now.

826
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:51,417
I'll handle this.

827
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,625
Aren't you going
to ask me in?

828
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:13,125
Can i get you a cup
of coffee; water, beer?

829
00:44:13,325 --> 00:44:14,750
Thanks,
i'm fine.

830
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,083
You don't mind me
asking a few questions?

831
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,050
No, not at all.

832
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,458
Is that your baby
i saw downstairs?

833
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:26,592
No, it's my
roommate jack's.

834
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,458
Who were those 2 men
you were talking to?

835
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:31,925
Friends...
of the mother's.

836
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:34,458
They were going to
take her for a ride.

837
00:44:34,658 --> 00:44:36,467
The baby,
not the mother.

838
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,750
They couldn't
because the car...

839
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,091
Had no
baby seat.

840
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,709
Mind if i have a
look at that baby?

841
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:46,125
I just love
little babies.

842
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:48,417
She's sleeping.

843
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,583
Sounds like
she's awake.

844
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:53,133
Mind if i
see her?

845
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:56,125
She doesn't
like strangers.

846
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:57,217
She may not be decent.

847
00:44:57,417 --> 00:44:59,542
I don't think
she'll mind.

848
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:06,625
There she is,
and she's got a friend.

849
00:45:06,825 --> 00:45:09,467
This is my
other roommate.

850
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,125
Detective melkowitz;
michael kellam.

851
00:45:12,325 --> 00:45:13,342
Hello.

852
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,717
What a cutie.

853
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:18,166
Mind if i hold her?
I just love kids.

854
00:45:18,366 --> 00:45:20,300
I'd rather not.

855
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,592
Go ahead.
It won't hurt.

856
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:25,333
You know how she
is around people.

857
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:26,937
Let him
hold her.

858
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:28,739
He won't
hurt her.

859
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:30,542
He's a
police officer.

860
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:32,750
All right.

861
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,125
Ohhh.

862
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,583
You're a heavy little
girl, aren't you?

863
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,467
Yes. Yes.
Yes.

864
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,083
She really is
heavy, isn't she?

865
00:45:51,283 --> 00:45:52,425
She's a good eater.

866
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,291
Good.
It means she won't grow up to be nervous.

867
00:45:56,834 --> 00:46:03,208
You've got nothing to
be nervous about, sweetie.

868
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:05,125
She's ready
for a change.

869
00:46:05,325 --> 00:46:07,050
Oh!

870
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,583
You know babies;
eat, sleep, and poop.

871
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:11,250
- I'll change her.
- Good idea.

872
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,800
What a cute
little baby.

873
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,050
Do you know where
her father is?

874
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,208
No. He's on location
doing a tv movie,

875
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:23,708
But i have
no idea where.

876
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:26,208
Do you know
this guy?

877
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,375
Not very well.
He's a friend of jack's.

878
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:33,592
I don't remember
his name.

879
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,671
He's paul milner.
He directs tv commercials.

880
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,750
On the side, he dabbles
in heroin smuggling.

881
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,733
Really?

882
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:46,883
Yeah.

883
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,509
I don't know him.

884
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:52,583
I'd appreciate that
glass of water now.

885
00:46:52,783 --> 00:46:55,500
Of course.
No problem.

886
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,667
Thank you.

887
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,083
I've got it.

888
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,000
hi, this
is peter, michael, and jack.

889
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,125
We're out playing.

890
00:47:17,325 --> 00:47:18,125
Shit!

891
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:22,500
Whoever it is, i'm here.

892
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,083
Peter?
Jack.

893
00:47:24,283 --> 00:47:25,467
How are you?

894
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:28,792
I got a message that
you were trying to reach me.

895
00:47:28,992 --> 00:47:32,000
Michael and i really
have to talk to you,

896
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,667
But you called us
at a bad time.

897
00:47:34,867 --> 00:47:36,646
We'll call back later.

898
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:38,425
I'm calling from turkey.

899
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,004
It took me an
hour to get through.

900
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:43,583
It's not an easy
place to phone from.

901
00:47:43,783 --> 00:47:45,300
This place
is amazing.

902
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,709
You will not believe
the stuff i bought for you.

903
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:51,091
This shit is
so cheap here.

904
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:55,083
I probably bought too much,
but i can always smuggle it in.

905
00:47:55,283 --> 00:47:57,133
Ha, ha.
I was kidding.

906
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:01,041
Thanks for calling.
We'll see you when you get back.

907
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,000
Oh!

908
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,966
I gotta get him
a glass of water,

909
00:48:12,166 --> 00:48:15,917
So his mouth isn't dry
when he reads me my rights.

910
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,041
Here you are,
sergeant.

911
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,634
Good-Bye.

912
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:37,841
Nice talking
to you.

913
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,208
It was very
illuminating.

914
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:47,008
He heard the phone call.
We're dead.

915
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:49,834
You think jack's involved?
I don't know.

916
00:48:50,034 --> 00:48:52,125
We gotta talk
to paul milner.

917
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:52,966
Why?

918
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:55,375
He is involved.

919
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,108
Couldn't you think of somewhere
better to hide the drugs?

920
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:02,542
It was perfect until you
insisted that he hold the baby.

921
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:05,467
I'm sorry.
Where'd you put 'em now?

922
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,500
In the garbage pail
under the dirty diapers.

923
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,509
Nobody's gonna
look for it there.

924
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:11,300
You realize we're in
trouble with this cop?

925
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,917
You realize that no one's
coming back for this kid?

926
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:17,883
Jesus, you're right.

927
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,417
We're stuck with her
'til jack gets back.

928
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:23,166
This is disconnected.

929
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:25,258
Oh, i'm late.

930
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:26,709
Wait a minute.
So am i.

931
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:28,729
Oh, damn it.

932
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:30,750
Mr. Kellam?

933
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:33,667
Mr. Mitchell?

934
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:38,358
Hello,
mrs. Hathaway.

935
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,554
It seems
that a horse...

936
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:42,756
Has befouled
the front walk.

937
00:49:42,956 --> 00:49:44,959
Do you know
anything about it?

938
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,166
Mrs. Hathaway,
how nice to see you.

939
00:49:48,366 --> 00:49:50,083
Really nice
to see you.

940
00:49:50,283 --> 00:49:51,759
oh.

941
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:54,667
She can sit
'til 5 p.M. I'll hurry.

942
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,959
Me, too.
I'm worried.

943
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:03,713
I got the one
with the moustache.

944
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:06,709
I'll tell melkowitz
we're moving.

945
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:21,125
There.

946
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,275
There you
go, pal.

947
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:34,008
What can
i do for ya?

948
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:37,291
I'd like "sports illustrated",
"popular science,"

949
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:40,792
Some gum and
that giraffe up there.

950
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:42,834
Which one's
the giraffe?

951
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:44,342
The rubber one.

952
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,375
That's not a giraffe,
that's a dinosaur.

953
00:50:47,575 --> 00:50:48,342
Whatever.

954
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:50,300
The one with
the polka dots?

955
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,917
Yeah, that's it.
That's a dinosaur, not a giraffe.

956
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,750
I don't care.
Just gimme the damn thing.

957
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:02,250
What about your change?
Never mind.

958
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,250
Mrs. Hathaway,
i'm home.

959
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,175
Mrs. Hathaway!

960
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,417
Mrs. Hathaway, where's mary?
I don't know.

961
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:42,841
Mary?

962
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:45,250
Oh. My god.

963
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:47,542
Mary!

964
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,792
Mary!

965
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:51,959
Mary!

966
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:56,041
Mary!

967
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,375
Mary!

968
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:03,542
Mary!

969
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,792
Mary!

970
00:52:24,917 --> 00:52:28,250
thank god.

971
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,333
Thank god.

972
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,458
No, everything's
fine, darling.

973
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:37,874
Everything's fine.

974
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:39,291
Don't you worry.

975
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,083
Nobody's gonna
hurt you.

976
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:45,834
No, it's okay.

977
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:47,396
Peter!

978
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:48,959
Peter!

979
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,816
She's okay.

980
00:52:52,016 --> 00:52:53,041
She's not hurt.

981
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,675
How are you?

982
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,175
I'm fine, just fine.

983
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:04,500
Did you see what those bastards
did to my videotapes?

984
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,125
We got a message.

985
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,625
What'd it say?

986
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,250
"Next time,
we'll take the baby."

987
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:16,709
It's okay.
It's okay.

988
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:18,125
Mr. Kellam?

989
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,883
Mr. Mitchell?

990
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,670
"The champ caught smith with
a savage left hook...

991
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,458
"That sent the challenger
crashing into the ropes.

992
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:33,217
"Smith, his left eye swollen,

993
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:37,875
"And the cut above his right
eye now much more bloody,

994
00:53:38,075 --> 00:53:41,792
Countered with a barrage
of vicious body blows."

995
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:43,050
What are you
reading her?

996
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,917
It doesn't matter
what i read,

997
00:53:46,117 --> 00:53:48,675
It's the tone you use.

998
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,917
She doesn't understand
the words, anyway.

999
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:52,300
Now, where were we?

1000
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:59,250
"The champ began the 5th round
like a man possessed,

1001
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:03,792
"Going straight for his
opponent's body...

1002
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:07,000
With ferocious energy."

1003
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,667
Ooohhh!

1004
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:58,750
Bang!

1005
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,458
Jeez! My face!
Watch out for my face!

1006
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:05,792
Peter!
It's me, jack! Jack!

1007
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:06,634
Jesus, jack!

1008
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:08,759
Jack!
No, wait.

1009
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,583
Get him off me.
You irresponsible...

1010
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:12,258
What is it with you guys!

1011
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,041
We should be asking you
that question.

1012
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:15,342
What'd i do?

1013
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,291
What the hell are you doing
back so soon anyway?

1014
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:21,041
- My part got cut, okay?
- Good!

1015
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:22,687
What is with him?

1016
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,133
Look at this place.

1017
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:27,166
What the hell is
going on around here?

1018
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:32,008
Aw, shit!

1019
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,258
What was that?
I'm not going anywhere...

1020
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,375
'Til you tell me what's going on.
We'll be glad to.

1021
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:39,217
That really hurt, peter.
Ow, ow, ow.

1022
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:42,837
Sunday morning,
i come back from jogging...

1023
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:46,458
To find this basket,
with this baby in it...

1024
00:56:46,658 --> 00:56:47,834
Waiting in the vestibule.

1025
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:49,383
Wha..., What?

1026
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:52,583
Inside is a note from sylvia
saying the baby was yours,

1027
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:54,667
And she was leaving it here
for you to deal with.

1028
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:56,467
Mine?

1029
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,959
Then, along comes another
package with your name on it.

1030
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:01,467
Only this time,
the package has heroin in it,

1031
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:06,291
And the narcotics squad, camped downstairs,
knows all about it. The cops?

1032
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:08,050
I don't believe this.

1033
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,583
I don't know anything about
any drugs or any police.

1034
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,458
I thought i was just
doing a favor for paul.

1035
00:57:12,658 --> 00:57:14,091
I didn't know
what was in that package.

1036
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,467
I certainly don't know
anything about that baby.

1037
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:21,542
Somebody drops a baby off,
and you assume he's mine?

1038
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,583
The child doesn't look
anything like me.

1039
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:28,550
I'm bigger...

1040
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,258
And i have
more hair.

1041
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:32,133
"Dear jack,
here's our baby.

1042
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:35,250
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn."

1043
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,208
"Sylvia."

1044
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:40,883
Oh, my god!

1045
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,583
Stratford.
A year and a half ago...

1046
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,208
I was doing
"taming of the shrew."

1047
00:57:48,408 --> 00:57:49,383
She was the shrew.

1048
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,959
I did some of my
best work in that.

1049
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,383
I got great reviews.

1050
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,675
Jack, you're
such a jerk.

1051
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,083
You're always thinking about yourself.
I want to kill you.

1052
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:01,425
Michael,
we won't have to.

1053
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:06,667
Jack, i would like to introduce
you to your daughter, mary.

1054
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,792
Wait a minute.
You can't be sure this is my kid.

1055
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:15,133
Uh, uh...

1056
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:16,717
What the hell am i
supposed to do with it?

1057
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:21,417
We've put our lives on hold,
jack, taking care of this kid.

1058
00:58:21,617 --> 00:58:24,667
Now, it's your turn.

1059
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,792
Okay, all right.
Fine.

1060
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,083
Until i straighten
this mess out,

1061
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:35,467
I'll take care of her.

1062
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:42,125
Why not? I'm an actor.
I can do a father.

1063
00:58:42,325 --> 00:58:46,042
Yeah.
What can be so difficult?

1064
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:49,759
Good night, jack.
Good night.

1065
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,509
Oh, down we go.

1066
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:55,625
Wait a minute!
What's the matter with her?

1067
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:57,792
Good night, jack.
Good night, jack.

1068
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,383
Hold still, kid.
Jeez.

1069
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,733
How do you put on these
goddamn things, anyway?

1070
00:59:10,933 --> 00:59:14,083
Figure it out for yourself, dickhead.
Nice shot.

1071
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:15,509
Look at
that stuff!

1072
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:17,883
Oh, my god.
What are you guys feeding her, huh?

1073
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:21,166
Oh, no, not on the silk sheets!
Not on the silk sheets!

1074
00:59:21,366 --> 00:59:24,187
Maybe i should show him
how to put on the diaper.

1075
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:27,208
Oh, no. I don't believe this.
Why me? Please!

1076
00:59:27,408 --> 00:59:28,841
Come on,
baby!

1077
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:33,166
Nope.
Let's give him another half hour.

1078
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:35,667
Let him
suffer.

1079
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,759
yes, yes.
I'm trying to reach paul milner.

1080
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:44,000
No, he was supposed to be in san
francisco, but i can't find him.

1081
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,917
Please tell him to call jack
holden as soon as he gets in.

1082
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,675
Is this
urgent?

1083
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,959
Yeah, "urgent's"
an understatement...

1084
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,583
Lady.

1085
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,667
I don't know why i bother
to give you this.

1086
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:00,583
It just goes
right through you.

1087
01:00:00,783 --> 01:00:02,812
Did you get hold
of your friend?

1088
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:05,041
No. Don't forget
to bolt the door.

1089
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,675
I won't.

1090
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:09,709
Remember, there's $250,000 in
heroin in that diaper pail.

1091
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:11,937
The baby wipes
are in the cabinet.

1092
01:00:12,137 --> 01:00:13,966
Right. Heroin's in
the diaper pail,

1093
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:17,417
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.
Where else would they be?

1094
01:00:17,617 --> 01:00:20,383
I can't
believe this.

1095
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,583
You're kidding me?
Thirty-Two benningtons in the london area?

1096
01:00:23,783 --> 01:00:26,383
Yes,
sir.

1097
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,458
Uh, i'll get back to you.
I, i...

1098
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:32,083
Oh, boy.

1099
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,834
I know, i know.
Yes, yes, yes. Sshh.

1100
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:46,083
Oh, god.
Yeah, yeah.

1101
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:50,750
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe i should, uh,

1102
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,667
Maybe i should
try mine, huh?

1103
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,458
Yeah.

1104
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,509
Mom!

1105
01:01:04,709 --> 01:01:06,550
Well, where
is she?

1106
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,083
Oh, mom. Wait 'til you see her.
You won't believe this.

1107
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:12,917
She is so beautiful.
She looks just like you.

1108
01:01:13,117 --> 01:01:15,333
You know, you
boys live like pigs.

1109
01:01:15,533 --> 01:01:17,217
Oh, mom.

1110
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:19,550
Look, there.
Isn't she beautiful?

1111
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,008
There she is!
Look at that little baby!

1112
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:26,250
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.

1113
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,542
Yes, i'm gonna
pick you right up.

1114
01:01:28,742 --> 01:01:30,834
Oh, i'm in awe.
I mean, look at you;

1115
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:32,425
You pick her
up like a pro.

1116
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,759
I pick her up
like a grandmother.

1117
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:36,775
that's called
experience.

1118
01:01:36,975 --> 01:01:38,592
Darling,
let's see you.

1119
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:42,083
She's so lovely.
What's her name? Mary.

1120
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,509
Mary!

1121
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:46,717
Well, mary!

1122
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:49,796
Look at the way
she's looking at me.

1123
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:52,875
For a moment, there,
i had her laughing.

1124
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:55,883
Yeah, just
like me, huh?

1125
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,917
Don't ruin this
for me, jack.

1126
01:01:59,117 --> 01:02:01,634
Oh, she
adores you.

1127
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:04,425
She knows that
you're her grandmother.

1128
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,583
It's like a biological thing,
an instant connection.

1129
01:02:07,783 --> 01:02:12,125
Cut the crap, jack.
What do you want?

1130
01:02:12,325 --> 01:02:15,542
Mom, i can't take
care of her.

1131
01:02:15,742 --> 01:02:17,467
I don't know
what to do.

1132
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,500
I was hoping that you could
take her for a little while,

1133
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,834
Not forever.
You know, until she's ready to vote?

1134
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:26,300
Oh, i would
love to.

1135
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,254
Do you know, jack, some people
live all their lives...

1136
01:02:30,454 --> 01:02:34,208
Without having anything this
wonderful to show for it?

1137
01:02:34,408 --> 01:02:36,008
I know,
mom.

1138
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:39,250
I'm going to do the most
wonderful thing for you;

1139
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,375
Absolutely
nothing.

1140
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:44,800
Why?

1141
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,041
Jack, you've always run
away from responsibility.

1142
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:52,208
Now, you have to
turn and face it.

1143
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:57,800
Mom...
i'm a screw-Up.

1144
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,917
You were a screw-Up.
Now, you're a father,

1145
01:03:01,117 --> 01:03:05,917
And you'll
be a fine one.

1146
01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:07,333
Think so?

1147
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,750
I know it.

1148
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:15,917
Your father, god rest
his soul, he was a screw-Up,

1149
01:03:16,117 --> 01:03:19,250
And he turned
out just fine.

1150
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:20,717
Really?

1151
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:23,500
Don't you remember?
Yeah, i guess

1152
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,875
Now, give
me a kiss.

1153
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:30,050
Mary, give
me a kiss.

1154
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:34,291
Now, you and
your friends...

1155
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:35,841
Clean this
place up.

1156
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:39,458
If not for yourselves,
do it for my granddaughter.

1157
01:03:39,658 --> 01:03:41,550
We will,
we will.

1158
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,667
Bye. Thanks anyway,
mom.

1159
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:50,208
Well, looks like it's
just you and me now, huh?

1160
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:52,675
what?

1161
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,420
Oh, jack?
There's 4 bottles prepared already,

1162
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,966
So you should be fine
until tomorrow morning.

1163
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:03,125
If her bottom gets red,
give her a bottle of water.

1164
01:04:03,325 --> 01:04:05,458
In about 3 hours...
white as marble.

1165
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:07,592
We'll be in seats
d-11 through 14.

1166
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:11,000
If there's a problem,
the usher will get us.

1167
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,258
Oh, here's
the number.

1168
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:17,250
Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?

1169
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,291
When are you
coming back?

1170
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:20,509
Around
midnight.

1171
01:04:20,709 --> 01:04:22,734
Don't worry
about us.

1172
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:24,959
Is this a four?
Yeah.

1173
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:30,041
it's good to have.

1174
01:04:31,959 --> 01:04:34,625
So, uh, what do
you want to do?

1175
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,858
This show's been running
longer than mary's been alive.

1176
01:04:46,058 --> 01:04:48,917
Peter, we agreed not to mention
her name tonight, right?

1177
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:50,675
Right.
My mistake.

1178
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,834
Who did you guys con
into sitting for you?

1179
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:53,425
Jack.

1180
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,667
Jack?
Daddy?

1181
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:58,166
Wooo...

1182
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,467
Are you
hungry?

1183
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:10,467
Well, we're
in luck here.

1184
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:13,966
tonight, the chef has...

1185
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:16,417
Cooked up something
very special for you.

1186
01:05:16,617 --> 01:05:20,063
He has taken the
juice of one cow,

1187
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:23,509
And sauteed it
with a fine sauce.

1188
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:26,800
It is presented,
surrounded by a bottle,

1189
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,625
And topped off with a
delicious rubber nipple, eh?

1190
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:35,375
Excellent choice!
Yes, yes, here we go.

1191
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:38,717
Ah, yes.

1192
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:41,375
what, what?

1193
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:45,879
Here you go.
Come on.

1194
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,041
please?

1195
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:54,625
You don't
want it, huh?

1196
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:00,883
I just changed you.
Huh?

1197
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:05,583
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?

1198
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:15,375
I always wanted to be
a musical comedy star.

1199
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:17,125
- Did you ever try?
- No.

1200
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,175
ladies and gentlemen,

1201
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:26,125
Act ii will begin
in three minutes.

1202
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:31,962
Michael, have you
ever done any acting?

1203
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:35,291
No, no, i leave that to jack.
The idiot.

1204
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,170
Ã¢â„¢âª i got sunshine ã¢â„¢âª

1205
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:43,966
Ã¢â„¢âª on a cloudy day ã¢â„¢âª

1206
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,316
Ã¢â„¢âª when it's cold outside ã¢â„¢âª

1207
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:48,667
Ã¢â„¢âª i got the month of may ã¢â„¢âª

1208
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:52,258
Ã¢â„¢âª i guess you say ã¢â„¢âª

1209
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:55,792
Ã¢â„¢âª what can make me
feel this way ã¢â„¢âª

1210
01:06:55,992 --> 01:06:56,966
Ã¢â„¢âª my girl ã¢â„¢âª

1211
01:06:57,166 --> 01:07:00,291
Maybe he fell asleep,
or fell and hit his head.

1212
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:02,416
He's probably
unconscious.

1213
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:04,342
Come on,
it's started.

1214
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:06,067
- There's an emergency.
- It's terrible.

1215
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:07,792
- I had a great time.
- See you at p.J.'S.

1216
01:07:07,992 --> 01:07:10,292
Sing us a song
from the 2nd act.

1217
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:12,792
Are they always
this strange?

1218
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:14,883
Yes...

1219
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:18,542
Since they got involved
with another woman.

1220
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,250
Wasn't that fun, huh?
Yes.

1221
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:22,383
Ooh, cover
that.

1222
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,983
Jack, where are you?
Jack!

1223
01:07:25,183 --> 01:07:27,583
I'm right here.
What, what?

1224
01:07:27,783 --> 01:07:28,966
What are
you doing?

1225
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:32,125
What's it look like
i'm doing, peter?

1226
01:07:32,325 --> 01:07:33,759
Is everything
all right?

1227
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:37,296
Everything's fine, yeah.
Why are you back so soon?

1228
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:40,834
Uh, we thought that we
might have left the stove on.

1229
01:07:41,034 --> 01:07:42,759
No, no.
The stove's not on.

1230
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:44,834
I think that uncles
peter and michael...

1231
01:07:45,034 --> 01:07:47,175
Are having a
nervous breakdown.

1232
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:52,625
I called, jack.
I let the phone ring for 5 minutes.

1233
01:07:52,825 --> 01:07:53,966
Why didn't you
answer the phone?

1234
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:56,875
Well, because mary and
i were taking a shower,

1235
01:07:57,075 --> 01:07:59,187
Weren't we?
We didn't hear anything.

1236
01:07:59,387 --> 01:08:01,500
Isn't that the
truth, mademoiselle?

1237
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,841
Oh, you are cute.

1238
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:13,208
I never put a phone
in a shower before.

1239
01:08:13,408 --> 01:08:15,709
Do you get many
calls in here?

1240
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:18,375
A steady
stream.

1241
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,291
Here.

1242
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:40,966
"Commercial director
hospitalized after mugging."

1243
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:44,295
Yeah, take a look at this.
It's your friend, paul milner.

1244
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,314
"Don't let this happen to you.
Be at the phone booth...

1245
01:08:47,514 --> 01:08:50,333
At the corner of 81st and
columbus at 8 pm tonight."

1246
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:54,583
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.

1247
01:08:54,783 --> 01:08:56,374
I've had enough
of this doo-Doo!

1248
01:08:56,574 --> 01:08:58,166
I want to finish
this, okay?

1249
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:04,166
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa.

1250
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:13,217
Hello?

1251
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:16,550
Yeah, we got
your message.

1252
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:21,300
Uh-Uh. No good.
We do it our way.

1253
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,208
Because we got the stuff, and
if you don't do it our way...

1254
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:29,759
Come on!
Say it, say it.

1255
01:09:29,959 --> 01:09:32,966
We flush it
down the toilet!

1256
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,959
Okay, now.
Listen, and listen good.

1257
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:39,625
There's a
construction site...

1258
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:30,208
Car 20 following suspects,
south bound, central park west.

1259
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,250
Come on,
peter!

1260
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,841
Damn it, joe,
we lost them!

1261
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:00,379
I've got 3 blocks
to turn around!

1262
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:02,717
That was great.
That was great.

1263
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:05,358
Everybody remember what
they're supposed to do?

1264
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:07,616
Come on, peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.

1265
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:09,875
Next, he'll want us to
synchronize our watches.

1266
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:12,542
Should we
do that?

1267
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:32,175
Yes, thank you.
Hello, sergeant melkowitz.

1268
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:37,291
My name is jack holden.
I think you know my 2 roommates.

1269
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:39,792
I must have been crazy
to agree with that guy.

1270
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:44,959
"Orange elevator."
Here it is.

1271
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,166
"Close door."

1272
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:04,208
Okay.
15, please.

1273
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:05,883
15?

1274
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,417
I'm all
filthy.

1275
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:28,733
What's wrong,
sweetheart?

1276
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:32,375
Come here.
What is it, huh?

1277
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:39,792
Well, you should have
told me before we left.

1278
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:46,083
Oh, boy.
This is not a good time to do this.

1279
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:48,521
Hold still.

1280
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:50,959
There you go.

1281
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:54,634
Michael!

1282
01:12:54,834 --> 01:12:56,667
They're
here.

1283
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,208
You know, this is
really aggravating.

1284
01:13:01,408 --> 01:13:02,966
I'm here,
by the pipes.

1285
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:04,583
I don't have
a lot of time...

1286
01:13:04,783 --> 01:13:07,217
Hold it,
just hold it.

1287
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:09,942
Look, where is the stuff?
Give it to me.

1288
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:12,467
It's in the elevator.
Oh, bullshit!

1289
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:15,509
It's in the control panel.
Check for yourself.

1290
01:13:15,709 --> 01:13:18,959
What am i supposed to do,
bring my handy tool kit here?

1291
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:21,133
You realize...

1292
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:24,670
We had absolutely
nothing to do with this.

1293
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,585
We had no idea what
was in the package.

1294
01:13:27,785 --> 01:13:30,813
I could've figured
that out in 4 seconds.

1295
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:34,041
I mean, you guys
don't behave like pros.

1296
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:36,841
Right!
We're not pros.

1297
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,316
I just said that,
didn't i?

1298
01:13:39,516 --> 01:13:41,792
Why make it
so complicated?

1299
01:13:41,992 --> 01:13:44,979
We've never
done this.

1300
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:47,966
I've got it!
Great.

1301
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:51,003
You're forgiven,
this time.

1302
01:13:51,203 --> 01:13:54,041
Very wise of you
to cooperate.

1303
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:55,342
Glad
it's over.

1304
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:57,841
No happier than
i am, believe me.

1305
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:01,041
Dealing with amateurs is
a real pain in the ass.

1306
01:14:01,241 --> 01:14:03,875
So is dealing
with professionals.

1307
01:14:04,075 --> 01:14:04,834
No doubt.

1308
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,509
Hey, what
is that?

1309
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:12,917
What are you,
abusing my trust here?

1310
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:14,342
Whoa!

1311
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,959
There's someone in there!
Come on!

1312
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,921
Come on,
michael!

1313
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:26,417
Oh, no.
Look out!

1314
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:37,400
I lost my balance.
You all right?

1315
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,667
Did you get it?
Yeah, i got it!

1316
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:55,083
Who's doing this?
I want that camera, punk!

1317
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,717
There's
6 switches!

1318
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:02,959
Aw, these guys
wrecked my day!

1319
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:11,383
Jack!
What the hell happened?

1320
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,291
He hit the wrong button.
He what?

1321
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,750
- Can it go any faster?
- This is it!

1322
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,354
You punks!

1323
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:22,427
Jack!

1324
01:15:22,627 --> 01:15:24,300
Jack!

1325
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,592
Nowhere to run,
nowhere to hide.

1326
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:30,792
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you... i want it!

1327
01:15:30,992 --> 01:15:33,125
Oh, no.

1328
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,258
Jack!

1329
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,649
Hit the button
on the left!

1330
01:15:37,849 --> 01:15:40,041
The one on the
left, jack!

1331
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:41,091
What, what?

1332
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,625
Hit the button
on the left!

1333
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:45,792
There is
no left.

1334
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,709
Come on, get it going faster!
I can't!

1335
01:15:50,909 --> 01:15:52,667
please...

1336
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,959
What's the matter?
Why is this elevator stopped?

1337
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:00,634
I got 'em!

1338
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:03,275
- What's going on?
- It just ain't runnin'.

1339
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,717
- Did you hit the buttons?
- Yeah. It's dead.

1340
01:16:05,917 --> 01:16:11,000
Uncles peter and michael will
be plenty ticked off with daddy.

1341
01:16:14,834 --> 01:16:19,133
Aren't you glad
he's on our side?

1342
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:21,542
You wait for me!
I know where you live!

1343
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,342
Oh, no,
vince.

1344
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:48,667
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening?

1345
01:16:48,867 --> 01:16:49,383
Why?

1346
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:51,625
It's okay, guys,
it's okay.

1347
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:57,733
Hi. Are you
sergeant melkowitz?

1348
01:16:57,933 --> 01:17:01,250
Yeah.
Are you the father?

1349
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,300
Yes, yes,
i am.

1350
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,500
Thanks for
the phone call.

1351
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,750
It was
peter's idea.

1352
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:10,383
She's okay.

1353
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:12,592
The guys you want
are in that elevator.

1354
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:15,834
The drugs are up there, too.
All you need to know is here.

1355
01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:17,675
It's very
illuminating.

1356
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,417
Thanks a lot.
If i have any questions,

1357
01:17:20,617 --> 01:17:23,208
I know where to
reach you guys.

1358
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:25,333
Can i hold
the baby?

1359
01:17:25,533 --> 01:17:27,759
No.

1360
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:29,792
Uh,
i guess not.

1361
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:34,525
Ã¢â„¢âª when the sun goes down ã¢â„¢âª

1362
01:17:34,725 --> 01:17:36,971
Ã¢â„¢âª and it's getting late ã¢â„¢âª

1363
01:17:37,171 --> 01:17:39,417
Ã¢â„¢âª you say it's time for bed ã¢â„¢âª

1364
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:43,650
Ã¢â„¢âª she just takes her time ã¢â„¢âª

1365
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,554
Ã¢â„¢âª acting like she never ã¢â„¢âª

01:17:46,754 --> 01:17:49,458
Ã¢â„¢âª heard a word you said ã¢â„¢âª

1367
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:55,566
Ã¢â„¢âª little baby want
to hold you tight ã¢â„¢âª

1368
01:17:55,766 --> 01:18:00,083
Ã¢â„¢âª she don't ever want
to say good night ã¢â„¢âª

1369
01:18:00,283 --> 01:18:01,258
Ã¢â„¢âª she's your lover ã¢â„¢âª

1370
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:05,500
Ã¢â„¢âª she wants to be daddy's girl ã¢â„¢âª

1371
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:09,796
Ã¢â„¢âª when the morning comes ã¢â„¢âª

1372
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:13,085
Ã¢â„¢âª and it's time to go ã¢â„¢âª

Ã¢â„¢âª try to make you stay ã¢â„¢âª

1377
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:30,670
Ã¢â„¢âª pretty baby gonna

1378
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:35,166
Ã¢â„¢âª she don't ever want

1379
01:18:35,366 --> 01:18:36,425
Ã¢â„¢âª she's your lover ã¢â„¢âª

1380
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:40,500
Ã¢â„¢âª she wants to be daddy's girl ã¢â„¢âª

1381
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:48,213
Ã¢â„¢âª she don't ever want

1383
01:18:52,723 --> 01:18:56,834
Ã¢â„¢âª when she puts her head
upon your shoulder ã¢â„¢âª

1384
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,425
Go again,
please.

1385
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:04,291
I will see you
burn in hell.

1386
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:06,062
You'll see
me where?

1387
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:07,634
In hell.
You heard me.

1388
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:11,166
Yes? And where will you be
while i'm burning in hell?

1389
01:19:11,366 --> 01:19:14,841
I'll tell you where
i'll be, you silly bitch.

1390
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,875
I will be in niagara falls, that's where.
Ha, ha, ha.

1391
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:22,966
Can you say
"michael"?

1392
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:27,250
Huh?
Yeah, can you say "michael"?

1393
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:32,921
Ã¢â„¢âª she won't understand ã¢â„¢âª

1394
01:19:33,121 --> 01:19:35,175
Ã¢â„¢âª why you're feeling sad ã¢â„¢âª

1395
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:40,170
Ã¢â„¢âª 'cause she's
leaving you alone ã¢â„¢âª

1396
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:44,793
Ã¢â„¢âª little woman gonna
make you cry ã¢â„¢âª

1397
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:49,417
Ã¢â„¢âª you don't ever want
to say goodbye ã¢â„¢âª

1398
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:51,008
Ã¢â„¢âª she's a lady ã¢â„¢âª

1399
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:54,917
Ã¢â„¢âª she'll always be
daddy's girl ã¢â„¢âª

1400
01:19:58,417 --> 01:20:02,625
Ã¢â„¢âª little woman gonna
break your heart ã¢â„¢âª

1401
01:20:02,825 --> 01:20:05,834
One bottle, please.
One bottle.

1402
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:09,175
Bottle.

1403
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:12,254
Here it comes.

1404
01:20:12,454 --> 01:20:15,333
Hup.
Ho, yup!

1405
01:20:15,533 --> 01:20:16,875
Ho!

1406
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:18,562
Uh-Oh.

1407
01:20:18,762 --> 01:20:20,322
Ho!

1408
01:20:20,522 --> 01:20:21,883
Ho!

1409
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,212
Ho, ho!

1410
01:20:24,412 --> 01:20:26,342
Hup!

1411
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:29,542
Hey, hey, yo!
Yeah!

1412
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:34,417
Sshh. I know, i know.
Yes, yes.

1413
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,425
What's
the matter?

1414
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,625
She doesn't want
to stop crying.

1415
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:47,083
That's not
like her.

1416
01:20:47,283 --> 01:20:48,217
Well?

1417
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:51,150
Let's give
it a try.

1418
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:53,883
Really?
All right.

1419
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,300
Ã¢â„¢âª do-Do-Dee-Do-Do ã¢â„¢âª

Ã¢â„¢âª good night, sweetheart
good night ã¢â„¢âª

1444
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:10,921
I didn't know
you sang so well.

1445
01:22:11,121 --> 01:22:13,959
Well, it kind of
helps her sleep.

1446
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:18,917
This is having quite
an effect on you.

1447
01:22:19,117 --> 01:22:21,634
You gonna have
any more kids?

1448
01:22:21,834 --> 01:22:25,125
I don't want to talk about it, rebecca.
Good night.

1449
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,583
Peter, i'm having a
lot of trouble sleeping.

1450
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,375
Could you
sing to me?

1451
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:49,667
Ã¢â„¢âª do-Do-Dee-Do-Do ã¢â„¢âª

1452
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,667
All right, i'll
see you later.

1453
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:57,125
Thank you.

1454
01:22:57,325 --> 01:22:59,583
Great.

1455
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,583
Good
morning.

1456
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:06,583
Hello.

1457
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:13,417
There you go.

1458
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:19,458
Yes?

1459
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:24,925
I'm sylvia...

1460
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,834
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.

1461
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,733
Just a
minute.

1462
01:23:33,933 --> 01:23:35,375
How is she?

1463
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:39,717
She's fine.

1464
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:43,041
She's teething.
That can be rough.

1465
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:47,796
Can i see her?

1466
01:23:47,996 --> 01:23:50,125
Sure.
Come on in.

1467
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,542
I don't believe how
wonderful she looks!

1468
01:24:09,742 --> 01:24:12,271
Oh!
Hello, mary!

1469
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:14,800
Hello,
my darling.

1470
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,417
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.

1471
01:24:19,617 --> 01:24:21,592
You're very
beautiful.

1472
01:24:21,792 --> 01:24:25,333
Your hair is growing.
You've changed so much,

1473
01:24:25,533 --> 01:24:27,249
And i've
missed it.

1474
01:24:27,449 --> 01:24:28,966
Mommy has
missed you.

1475
01:24:29,166 --> 01:24:32,000
Oh, i never thought
i'd miss her this much.

1476
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,000
Hello!

1477
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,509
Hello!

1478
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:41,667
Where's my baby?
Is jack here?

1479
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,800
I'll get him.

1480
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,166
Mary, look how
big you've gotten!

1481
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:51,383
Ah!

1482
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:54,208
Michael.
Michael.

1483
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,962
Sylvia's here.

1484
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:02,875
Mary's leaving.

1485
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:27,883
She looks very
happy, jack.

1486
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:31,667
You've obviously
taken good care of her.

1487
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:35,841
I'm sorry.

1488
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:39,587
I shouldn't have left
her the way i did.

1489
01:25:39,787 --> 01:25:43,333
I hope it didn't
cause too much trouble.

1490
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:48,125
No, no.
No trouble at all

1491
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,717
Sylvia...

1492
01:25:53,917 --> 01:25:56,709
There's something
i need to know.

1493
01:25:56,909 --> 01:26:00,625
Is she
really mine?

1494
01:26:00,825 --> 01:26:04,625
Yes, she is.

1495
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:14,125
So, what are you going to do now?
Do you have any idea?

1496
01:26:14,325 --> 01:26:17,500
I, uh...
i'm going home.

1497
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:24,458
I can't work and take care
of mary on my own, so uh...

1498
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:27,834
We're going to move
in with my family.

1499
01:26:28,034 --> 01:26:30,291
They said
they'd help.

1500
01:26:31,667 --> 01:26:34,166
You're going
to london?

1501
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,291
Yeah.

1502
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:51,921
When?

1503
01:26:52,121 --> 01:26:54,250
Tonight.

1504
01:26:57,166 --> 01:26:59,333
Is that what you
really want to do?

1505
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:00,759
Sorry?

1506
01:27:00,959 --> 01:27:03,375
Never mind.

1507
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:09,583
You pack all
the bottles?

1508
01:27:09,783 --> 01:27:11,383
Yeah.

1509
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:14,166
And the cans
of formula?

1510
01:27:14,366 --> 01:27:15,667
You packed 'em.

1511
01:27:15,867 --> 01:27:16,959
Yeah.

1512
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,634
What about
the blender?

1513
01:27:20,834 --> 01:27:23,667
Should we give her that,
to mash up bananas and stuff?

1514
01:27:23,867 --> 01:27:25,258
Sure.

1515
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:29,583
And diapers.
You pack extra pampers?

1516
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:31,333
Yeah.

1517
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:35,175
How can he
let her go?

1518
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,358
If i were jack,
i would not let her go.

1519
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:41,542
Neither would i, michael,
neither would i.

1520
01:27:41,742 --> 01:27:44,759
But he's
the father.

1521
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:47,375
I don't think he
wants her to go.

1522
01:27:47,575 --> 01:27:50,834
But he just
can't admit it.

1523
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:57,750
You know, if you want
anything at all, you call us.

1524
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:59,834
She'll probably be
hungry in an hour.

1525
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:01,208
She's a real
good eater, so...

1526
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:02,759
Like her
daddy.

1527
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:04,959
Some of this
stuff's fragile.

1528
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,925
I got it.

1529
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:09,834
If she wakes up at night,
she likes to be sung to.

1530
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:12,166
50's and 60's
music works best.

1531
01:28:12,366 --> 01:28:13,300
I'll remember
that.

1532
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,191
You're all set.
Everything's packed.

1533
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,083
If you need anything
else, call us.

1534
01:28:19,283 --> 01:28:20,792
Anything.
Okay?

1535
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,875
Thank you.

1536
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:29,041
Well, here, let me.
Go ahead.

1537
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,333
There we go.

1538
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,383
Gloucester hotel,
please.

1539
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,375
I'll write and let you
know how we're doing.

1540
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:43,717
Look,
darling.

1541
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:47,004
Wave goodbye,
sweetheart.

1542
01:28:47,204 --> 01:28:50,291
Bye, mary.
Bye, mary.

1543
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:02,966
Ã¢â„¢âª do-Do-Do-Do-Do ã¢â„¢âª

1544
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:05,628
Ã¢â„¢âª good night, sweetheart ã¢â„¢âª

1545
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:08,291
Ã¢â„¢âª well it's time to go ã¢â„¢âª

1546
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:09,675
Ã¢â„¢âª do-Do-Do-Do-Do ã¢â„¢âª

1547
01:29:09,875 --> 01:29:12,317
Ã¢â„¢âª good night, sweetheart ã¢â„¢âª

1548
01:29:12,517 --> 01:29:14,959
Ã¢â„¢âª well it's time to go ã¢â„¢âª

1549
01:29:15,159 --> 01:29:16,592

Ã¢â„¢âª baby i just can't

01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,125

01:30:30,225 --> 01:30:32,625
Ã¢â„¢âª well it's time to go ã¢â„¢âª

1577
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:34,175
Ã¢â„¢âª do-Do-Do-Do ã¢â„¢âª

1578
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:36,691
Ã¢â„¢âª i hate to leave you ã¢â„¢âª

1579
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:39,008
Ã¢â„¢âª i really must say ã¢â„¢âª

1580
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:42,417
Ã¢â„¢âª oh good night, sweetheart ã¢â„¢âª

1581
01:30:42,617 --> 01:30:43,841
Ã¢â„¢âª good night ã¢â„¢âª

01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:46,834
Ã¢â„¢âª do-Do-Do-Do,
do-Do-Do-Do, do-Do-Do- Ã¢â„¢âª

1583
01:30:47,034 --> 01:30:49,271
Ã¢â„¢âª i hate to leave you ã¢â„¢âª

1584
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:51,509
Ã¢â„¢âª i really must say ã¢â„¢âª

1585
01:30:51,709 --> 01:30:54,083
Ã¢â„¢âª oh good night, sweetheart ã¢â„¢âª

1586
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:56,208
Ã¢â„¢âª good night ã¢â„¢âª

1587
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:12,875
Guys like us shouldn't
be raising kids, anyway.

1588
01:31:13,075 --> 01:31:14,592
Right?

1589
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:16,962
Well,
should we?

1590
01:31:17,162 --> 01:31:19,133
I suppose not.

1591
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:21,959
She's better off
with her mother.

1592
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:27,383
And we are definitely
better off...

1593
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:30,583
Now that everything's back to normal.
Right?

1594
01:31:30,783 --> 01:31:32,500
Whatever you
say, jack.

1595
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:37,917
Right.

1596
01:31:41,291 --> 01:31:44,083
So how come
i feel so bad?

1597
01:31:44,283 --> 01:31:46,091
What'd
you say?

1598
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:49,217
How come
i feel so bad?

1599
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:52,175
I have this ache,
right here.

1600
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:55,208
I don't know.
What do you think, mike?

1601
01:31:55,408 --> 01:31:56,749
Could be
the wine.

1602
01:31:56,949 --> 01:31:58,091
It's not
the wine.

1603
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:00,383
Well, what
is it, then?

1604
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,709
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.

1605
01:32:03,909 --> 01:32:05,425
Maybe it's
something you ate.

1606
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:08,959
Maybe you're not
getting enough sleep.

1607
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:11,091
It's not that.

1608
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,000
Then what the
hell is it?

1609
01:32:15,959 --> 01:32:17,500
I miss mary.

1610
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:22,166
Okay?

1611
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:25,959
I miss mary.

1612
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,166
I just wish there was
something i could do.

1613
01:32:30,366 --> 01:32:33,500
Well, maybe
there is.

1614
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,133
What?

1615
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:40,208
When's her
flight leaving?

1616
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:46,337
Yo, taxi!

1617
01:32:46,537 --> 01:32:48,834
Taxi!

1618
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,834
Kennedy airport.

1619
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:00,966
Who are you
guys chasing?

1620
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:04,417
My baby girl.
Her mother's taking her to london.

1621
01:33:04,617 --> 01:33:05,667
How old?

1622
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:06,717
7 months.

1623
01:33:06,917 --> 01:33:08,425
7 months.
That's hard work.

1624
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,509
Pretty soon,
they start to walk.

1625
01:33:10,709 --> 01:33:12,875
The first time you
hear the word "daddy,"

1626
01:33:13,075 --> 01:33:14,467
Your heart
just melts.

1627
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:17,083
Can you drive a
little faster, please?

1628
01:33:17,283 --> 01:33:18,250
Yeah.

1629
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:35,175
Thank you.

1630
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:38,458
Good
luck, guys.

1631
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:03,208
It's four,
gate four!

1632
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:09,333
Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellows. One at a time.

1633
01:34:09,533 --> 01:34:10,916
Hold it.
Any metal?

1634
01:34:11,116 --> 01:34:12,500
Put it in
here, please.

1635
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,300
Go through.

1636
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,583
Thank you, sir,
one at a time...

1637
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,834
1, 2, 3, 4!

1638
01:34:30,959 --> 01:34:34,125
Miss,
flight 176?

1639
01:34:34,325 --> 01:34:35,291
That's it.

1640
01:35:28,959 --> 01:35:31,417
Thank you.
Good night.

1641
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:05,050
Sylvia.

1642
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,837
Are you all right?
We thought you'd gone.

1643
01:36:08,037 --> 01:36:10,460
I couldn't go, jack.
I couldn't do it.

1644
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,883
I don't want to
make another mistake.

1645
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:16,542
I knew if i took her,
i'd be making another mistake.

1646
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:18,717
I have to work...

1647
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:22,291
And i can't do that and
take care of mary alone.

1648
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:24,217
Do you know
what's it's like?

1649
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:27,375
A one-Room flat,
on your feet all day,

1650
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:29,675
Working or
auditioning.

1651
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:33,317
I'm on the job sometimes
until 3 in the morning.

1652
01:36:33,517 --> 01:36:36,959
Since mary gets up at 5:30,
i don't get much sleep.

1653
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:40,133
And after 5:30,
it starts over at 9:00.

1654
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:43,542
By the time i change her and
play with her, it's 8:00.

1655
01:36:43,742 --> 01:36:44,883
Forget about
sleep after that.

1656
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:48,709
With baby-Sitters, all my money
is sucked down the tubes.

1657
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:51,583
And me so tired, i can't
take mary to the park.

1658
01:36:51,783 --> 01:36:54,083
Getting time for
the park is a bitch!

1659
01:36:54,283 --> 01:36:56,966
I mean, i love
my job but,

1660
01:36:57,166 --> 01:37:01,041
I sometimes feel like i'm just
working to pay the sitters...

1661
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:03,166
And i run
around all day,

1662
01:37:03,366 --> 01:37:05,291
And i don't
get enough sleep.

1663
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:09,583
I don't think i'm taking
very good care of mary.

1664
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:12,250
- Of course you are.
- I am?

1665
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:14,342
We know how
hard it is.

1666
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:16,942
The 3 of us could
hardly manage.

1667
01:37:17,142 --> 01:37:19,200
I don't want
to go to london.

1668
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,829
I want to work
in new york.

1669
01:37:22,029 --> 01:37:24,227
But i can't
do that alone.

1670
01:37:24,427 --> 01:37:26,425
I hope i don't have to.

1671
01:37:26,625 --> 01:37:31,291
I need help.
I need someone to help me.

1672
01:37:31,491 --> 01:37:33,091
We'll help.
We will help!

1673
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:36,091
You can leave her
anytime you want.

1674
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:38,792
When you go for an
audition or shopping,

1675
01:37:38,992 --> 01:37:41,417
Or you want to
be by yourself.

1676
01:37:41,617 --> 01:37:43,550
I hoped you'd
say that.

1677
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:46,625
Really?
Thank you, so much!

1678
01:37:46,825 --> 01:37:48,125
Of course!

1679
01:37:48,325 --> 01:37:49,425
Hold it, guys.

1680
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:51,509
I don't like
this arrangement.

1681
01:37:51,709 --> 01:37:55,091
I just don't want to
be mary's baby-Sitter.

1682
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:58,795
I want... We want to be able
to see her all the time.

1683
01:37:58,995 --> 01:38:02,500
I agree, so what are you saying?
What do you mean?

1684
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,383
I'm saying,
that i think,

1685
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:08,875
Mary should move in
with us permanently,

1686
01:38:09,075 --> 01:38:10,966
That we should
be her family.

1687
01:38:11,166 --> 01:38:16,000
It's lovely of you to offer...
but i couldn't let mary...

1688
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,091
No, no, no, no...

1689
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:19,966
You're right.
She's your daughter.

1690
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:23,208
She needs a full-Time mother.
That's why...

1691
01:38:23,408 --> 01:38:26,583
We think that you
should move in, too.

1692
01:38:26,783 --> 01:38:28,133
It's a great idea!
Yeah!

1693
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:30,542
Oh sylvia, come on.
4 is better than 3.

1694
01:38:30,742 --> 01:38:33,300
Uh, do you
have room?

1695
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,759
I'll build you
and mary rooms.

1696
01:38:35,959 --> 01:38:39,333
Yeah, he builds rooms!
Please say yes!

1697
01:38:39,533 --> 01:38:40,708
Yes!

1698
01:38:40,908 --> 01:38:41,750
Yes!

1699
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:43,354
Yes!

1700
01:38:43,554 --> 01:38:44,959
Yes!

1701
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:56,166
Ã¢â„¢âª something happened
baby, in my life ã¢â„¢âª

1702
01:38:56,366 --> 01:39:00,175
Ã¢â„¢âª the minute i saw you ã¢â„¢âª

1703
01:39:00,375 --> 01:39:03,709
Ã¢â„¢âª all the others
faded from my life ã¢â„¢âª

1704
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:07,800
Ã¢â„¢âª the minute
i saw you, hey! Ã¢â„¢âª

1705
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,041
Ã¢â„¢âª nothing better
baby, in my life ã¢â„¢âª

1706
01:39:11,241 --> 01:39:13,542
Ã¢â„¢âª 'til the minute i saw you ã¢â„¢âª
