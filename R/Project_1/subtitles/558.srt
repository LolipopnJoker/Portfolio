00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,355
Ready?

3
00:01:26,495 --> 00:01:28,205
FBl.

4
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,625
- Throw that piece of shit in there.
- No, wait.

5
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,172
Sit down and shut up, you old fool.

6
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,591
Ten thousand.

7
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,093
- On... bug-eye boy.
- What?!

8
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:43,804
Big balls, huh? Big cojones, huh?

9
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:47,891
- I'll take that bet.
- Ready? And fight!

10
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,458
Y'all never heard of Soul, Korea?

11
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:21,759
- FBl! Everybody freeze.
- Don't move.

12
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,398
- John!
- A little help down here, please?

13
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,483
No doubt. Are you all right?

14
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,988
I'm just takin' a bath
with Old Yeller down here.

15
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:46,492
Could you open the cage? I'm a married man.
I'm not used to this much attention.

16
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,412
Satellite TV and a six-pack
do not a full life make.

17
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,791
You gotta understand. I'm not like you.

18
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,043
On the street, I gotta keep it simple.

19
00:02:56,127 --> 00:03:00,882
You know what I mean? I can't have
a family and home out there distracting me.

20
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,801
That's funny.
I couldn't be out there without it.

21
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:08,514
OK. We've got a live one, people.
Conference room in five.

22
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:12,893
Oh, Malcolm. Didn't recognize you
with the make-up off. Got the Michaels file?

23
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,063
- Got it.
- Good. Bring it here.

24
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:20,359
I'm just sayin', on the street I can't have
no distractions. I gotta be ready for anything.

25
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:26,449
- Nice.
- You too grown for this shit, man.

26
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,544
A prison escape leaves one man dead.

27
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:41,922
Lester Vesco,
serving a life sentence for murder,

28
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:44,467
has escaped from a federal penitentiary.

29
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,888
He is seen here on security cameras
robbing the Century Union Bank.

30
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,808
- Vesco is extremely dangerous.
- Oh, my God.

31
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,978
What's wrong?

32
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,107
Nothing's wrong.

33
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,526
You know, how would you like
to go on a little vacation?

34
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,739
- I don't know. We've never been on one.
- How fast can you get ready?

35
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:25,217
Ready.

36
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:30,471
Well, you look ready to me.

37
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,307
Grab your medicine.

38
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,106
Got your seat belt on?

39
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,191
- Yup.
- Let's roll.

40
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,422
Lester Vesco. Not a nice man, people.

41
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:09,386
Two years ago, he robbed a bank,
popped a guard and the bank manager

42
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,264
and walked out with two million
in cash and bearer bonds.

43
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,476
We got him, but the money
was never recovered.

44
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,020
Twelve hours ago, he killed a prison doctor

45
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:22,941
and drove out the front gate
in the man's Volvo. Very creative.

46
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:28,029
- What about the girl from the robbery?
- Lester's girlfriend. Sherry Pierce.

47
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,824
Never convicted. Worked in the bank.

48
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:33,201
So she gives him access to the vault,

49
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:36,830
cries on the stand
and walks away with two million large.

50
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:39,082
Exactly. But we never proved it.

51
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,503
She's pretty smart.
Keeps a low profile, works two shit jobs.

52
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:45,839
Now it looks like she's in the wind.

53
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,633
So we find her,
we find Lester, we find the money.

54
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:52,929
- What about this stepbrother in Oakland?
- You and Gallagher take it.

55
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:57,726
- Get some warrants. Set up a surveillance.
- Great. Malcolm and I can stay here

56
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,644
and hit the phones.

57
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:03,189
No, no, I've got something special
planned for you two.

58
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:08,153
Sherry's got a long-lost grandmother
in Cartersville, Georgia.

59
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:13,450
And who knows, Malcolm? Maybe you'll find
an Armani outlet - by the Piggly Wiggly.

60
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,536
That's all, people.

61
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:58,912
- There's Big Momma.
- What a classic scene.

62
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:01,540
Genteel old lady, pruning her roses.

63
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,088
Lord, I done told Sadie about this dog.

64
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:11,466
Let me catch you here again
and I'll barbecue some hot dog!

65
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,305
- Got it.
- You know what, man?

66
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:20,308
Erskine and Stoner probably caught
that girl Sherry two days ago.

67
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:24,104
They just wanted us to sit here
pickin' ticks off our asses.

68
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:28,317
Nobody's tried to kill you for days.
The stress must be overwhelming.

69
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,154
I'm just here to catch a bad guy.
If it goes down hard, so be it.

70
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:36,533
If we could get in to plant the surveillance
equipment, we wouldn't be stuck here.

71
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,535
Hey, what do we have here?

72
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:45,709
Must be one of those Southern traditions.
Exchanging baked goods in the street.

73
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:50,839
Nah, you bring them over.
That's how you meet the new neighbors.

74
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,966
Oh, man.

75
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,597
- Where are you going?
- While she's out, I'll set the surveillance.

76
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,224
Stall 'em.

77
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,309
- Stall them?
- Trust me.

78
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:05,771
- Malcolm!
- Four and a half minutes.

79
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,986
- Well, how-dee, ladies.
- Hello, neighbor.

80
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:15,781
Welcome to Maple Drive.
We hope you will come to love...

81
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:19,493
Oh, shut up and give the man
your dry old Bundt cake so I can go home.

82
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:24,247
You'll have to excuse Hattie Mae.
Her stomach's not feelin' too good.

83
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:26,125
I'm Miss Patterson

84
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,377
and this is Miss Other Patterson.

85
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,632
We call her that because she's from
a whole different set of Pattersons.

86
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:42,558
- My name's John.
- John what?

87
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:47,980
- Patterson! Isn't that a weird coincidence?
- Yes, it is.

88
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,482
Maybe we're all related.

89
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:03,787
I used to be married, but not any more.

90
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:06,623
Oh, Lord. Is she with Jesus?

91
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:10,628
No. Actually, Jesus,
I think, is how he pronounces it.

92
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,254
He was the gardener.

93
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:16,425
I caught him spreadin' fertilizer
in the bedroom, if you know what I mean.

94
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:20,179
'Scuse me, honey.
Here's your corn bread. I got to go.

95
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:23,474
No, you can't! Ladies, it was really a pleasure.

96
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:26,143
Wait. You can't leave.

97
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:31,941
Where's this great Southern hospitality I've
heard about, Hattie Mae? lf I can call you that.

98
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:36,571
I was hoping we could sit in the front porch
and shuck corn, shoot squirrels...

99
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:41,075
Boy, you ain't right. Did somebody
hook you up to a jumper cable?

100
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:43,828
When I say I got to go, move - I got to go.

101
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:46,455
Wait!

102
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:53,337
I'm not crazy, just a little lonely.
We could spend some quality time together.

103
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:58,759
Say, you know what I do
when I have an upset stomach?

104
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:01,220
I jog. Yes! Come on!

105
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:05,224
It's good when you got the runs.
Come on, me and you around the block.

106
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:10,062
Listen, either I can go around you, or
I can go through you. Whichever you decide.

107
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:11,773
Fine.

108
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:14,984
Shit!

109
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,202
- You cannot go in there.
- You're sayin' I can't go in my own house?

110
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:28,873
No, I'm telling you, you cannot go in there
without giving me a big

111
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,334
Southern welcome.

112
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:35,963
That's it. A little sugar on it.

113
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,508
If you want a second helping, let me know.

114
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:41,594
- Cos I got two knees!
- No, I'm good. God bless ya.

115
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:44,638
- Cos I got to go.
- Yeah. Thanks for the corn bread.

116
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:49,727
Jesus, let me just make it to the bathroom
before I lose my bowels all over myself.

117
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:55,900
Jesus.

118
00:10:57,652 --> 00:10:59,738
Will I make it?

119
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,408
Have mercy, Lord.

120
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:08,371
Those stewed prunes!

121
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:12,458
They just goin' right straight through me.

122
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:25,866
I done seen a lot of scary shit in my day,

123
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,576
but damn - that was a lotta ass.

124
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,290
I think I need a splint or somethin'.

125
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:36,751
Just... I'll be all right.

126
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:34,768
"Dr Green. Wilshire Pediatrics."

127
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:39,314
Here we go.

128
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,484
God.

129
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,487
Miss it. Miss it.

130
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,989
Think you can throw me off my shit?

131
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:50,200
I'm in the zone.

132
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:53,036
100 dollars. Come on.

133
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,706
- That shit don't count.
- What do you mean?

134
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,333
- You were in my grill.
- 100 bucks, man.

135
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:02,253
Who could be callin' her at this time of night?

136
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:05,007
Trussy! How ya do...

137
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:08,343
Oh, Lord. William's in the hospital again?

138
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:13,348
I'll be there. I'm prepared.
I can stay a week or two weeks...

139
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:17,269
She's leavin', man. Now's our chance
to tap the phones. Come on.

140
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:23,651
- Driver, please get me to the bus station.
- Yes, ma'am.

141
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:27,446
I gotta go and help my friend out
for a couple of weeks.

142
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,586
Over here.

143
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,051
Jesus!

144
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:52,096
Back up off me.

145
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:55,599
- Sorry.
- Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

146
00:14:55,683 --> 00:15:00,896
Go on, leave me a little message. As soon as
I get back, I'll give you a shout. God bless.

147
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:04,399
Big Momma? It's Sherry.

148
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,320
Surprised, huh?

149
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,572
Listen, I was taking a little vacation

150
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:13,159
and I was headed in your direction,

151
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:18,205
and I thought maybe I'd stop in and check
on you since I haven't seen you in a while.

152
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:22,168
But it looks like you're not home,
so I'll see you on the next trip.

153
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:24,545
No!

154
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:27,298
- We lost her.
- No! Look...

155
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:30,634
And, Big Momma, I just want you to know...

156
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,014
I know it’s been a long time
since we've talked, but...

157
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:38,350
I really do love you
and miss you very much.

158
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:42,063
Praise the Lord.

159
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:45,107
It's my baby Sherry!

160
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:48,068
Big Momma, you're there!

161
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,862
Hi!

162
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,535
Yes, I'm here, honey child,
lamb chop, sugar foot.

163
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,662
Hang up.

164
00:15:57,745 --> 00:16:02,458
I know things haven't been so great
between us these past couple of years,

165
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:05,753
and I just want you to know

166
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:11,551
that your place is the only place
that's ever really felt like home for me.

167
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:16,472
And I can't wait to see you
and I love you very much.

168
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,558
Well, I'm...

169
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:24,147
I'm glad it felt like a home to you, Sherry.

170
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,232
You hurry home, then. All right?

171
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,485
And I'm gonna make sure that I lock you up

172
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,113
so you don't get away from me ever again.

173
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:36,116
- Bye, Big Momma.
- OK, Sherry. Bye-bye.

174
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,874
- What the hell did you just do?
- Kept us in play.

175
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:47,879
If Big Momma's not here, she'll leave,
and then we have no case.

176
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,964
Don't worry.

177
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:52,467
Big Momma'll be here.

178
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:25,916
Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

179
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,753
Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

180
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,631
Hello. This is Hattie Mae Pierce.

181
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:28,354
All right, Trent.
Mind your manners. No back talk.

182
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,565
And remember... Look at me.

183
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:33,777
And remember that our business
is our business.

184
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,988
They're here. Now here's the earpiece.

185
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:40,325
If anybody asks, tell them
it's your new hearing aid.

186
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,535
How do I look?

187
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:45,914
If I were an 85-year-old man
with cataracts and a bad hip,

188
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:48,041
- I'd take a run at you.
- Man, shut up.

189
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,918
Big Momma? We're here.

190
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:55,715
Lord!

191
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,176
- Look what the wind done blew my...
- Hi.

192
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:01,930
Damn, you fine...

193
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:04,307
Sherry, you changed.

194
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,644
Me? Look at you, Big Momma!
I hardly recognize you.

195
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,729
Child, that's only make-up.

196
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:15,694
Now come on over here
and give your Big Momma a great big hug.

197
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,407
It's so good to see you, Big Momma.

198
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:25,286
- I thought you'd forgotten all about me.
- Hush your mouth, child.

199
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,374
- Big Momma could never forget that ass.
- What?!

200
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,710
Ma. Asthma.

201
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:34,004
Remember you had asthma?

202
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,381
I remember it like it was yesterday.

203
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:39,968
You used to puff and wheeze
somethin' wicked.

204
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,181
I said "Sherry, are you all right?"
You said...

205
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,851
Oh, damn. Big Momma gettin' light-headed.

206
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,979
Wait a second.
Maybe we should take you upstairs.

207
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:55,150
Bless your little asthmatic heart.

208
00:19:56,944 --> 00:20:00,697
- Who's he?
- Oh, Big Momma. That's Trent, my son.

209
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,200
You haven't seen him since he was a baby.

210
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:06,578
Oh, yeah. Trent!

211
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,789
Hi, Trent.

212
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:13,001
- Say hi.
- I should've known just by lookin' at him.

213
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,839
Look at that nappy little grapefruit head.

214
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:21,885
You know, it runs in the family.
Grapefruit heads.

215
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,096
Your granddaddy had a big-ass head.

216
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:27,307
The hotel out by the freeway had a pool.

217
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:30,394
- Sweetheart...
- He's a quick little one, isn't he?

218
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,438
- Yeah.
- They grow up so fast,

219
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:36,232
what with the color television an' all.

220
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:40,988
But he'll come to find Big Momma
pretty quick herself.

221
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,160
- I'm starving.
- Are y'all hungry?

222
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:50,455
- Actually, we are pretty hungry.
- Come on in. I'm here to take care of y'all.

223
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,833
Come on, Sherry. Come on in.

224
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:58,172
- Sherry, let me get this bag for you.
- Oh, no, Big Momma. I got it.

225
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:00,758
You can take mine.

226
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,843
You are somethin'. Isn't he?

227
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:06,138
You're gonna love Big Momma's cooking.

228
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:10,309
Think it's gonna be windy today.
There's a draught.

229
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:18,525
There we go.

230
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,570
See, Sherry, I like to make sure

231
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:24,781
that my food is properly lubricated.

232
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:27,576
It goes down easier that way.

233
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:32,914
Oh, my God. He's gonna kill her.
This guy can't even make toast.

234
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:35,209
Let's see what's in there to cook now.

235
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,590
We got some pork chops,

236
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:42,216
turkey necks...

237
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,426
Child, you like these?

238
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,303
One for me...

239
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:51,892
Well, I'm probably not gonna eat them,
but you can have mine. All right, Sherry?

240
00:21:51,975 --> 00:21:54,102
Now, Sherry,

241
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,063
sit back, watch and learn.

242
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:02,111
Malcolm, I don't know how to tell you this...
but your face is falling off!

243
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,538
Big Momma? Are you OK?

244
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:17,043
- Where's that pot?
- I'm gonna go and start setting the table.

245
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,962
Yeah, you do that, Sherry. Where's that pot?

246
00:22:22,089 --> 00:22:24,175
Malcolm!

247
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:29,346
What are you doin' over there?

248
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:45,738
- What are you doin'?
- Take it easy!

249
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,494
Big Momma,
I think you just had a Peeping Tom.

250
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:56,123
That's all right, child.
I get them all the time.

251
00:22:56,665 --> 00:23:01,921
You do your housework in the nude
and it tends to attract the wrong element.

252
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:07,010
Nothin' like a little excitement
to get the blood goin'.

253
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:15,560
While I fix dinner,

254
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:19,981
tell me what brings you
to Big Momma's house after all these years.

255
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:22,900
Well, we were just on a little vacation.

256
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,488
Middle of the night seems
a funny time to go on vacation.

257
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,865
I thought you might have been in trouble.

258
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:33,119
- How did you know we left at night?
- I didn't.

259
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,080
No, no.

260
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,295
- Big Momma, are you OK?
- Oh, yeah.

261
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,922
Ain't nothin' but some scaldin' pork grease.

262
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,718
- Here. Let's dry you off.
- So what about it, child?

263
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,138
You in trouble? Is there something
you wanna tell Big Momma?

264
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:59,604
Big Momma, is that duct tape on your face?

265
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:03,149
Oh, dear! The duct tape.

266
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,277
I guess you're wonderin'
why I got the duct tape.

267
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,905
- It's a beauty secret.
- Really?

268
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:13,117
Yes. You never used duct tape
to get rid of them unsightly hairs?

269
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:17,038
- No.
- It works particularly well on the bikini area.

270
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,457
- Really?
- No doubt, girl.

271
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,459
The pork chops are on fire.

272
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,428
Big Momma, here!

273
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:42,271
Who's ready to eat?

274
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:49,153
We could always run down
to Ring-A-Ding Burger.

275
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,114
Get him a Smiley Meal.

276
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,533
Oh, no, Big Momma. This...

277
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,993
This looks great.

278
00:24:56,077 --> 00:25:00,665
Well, then, eat up. Take you a big old forkful.

279
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,001
Watch it. The plate's hot now.

280
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,505
I hope I didn’t put too much seasoning salt.

281
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:14,387
- Would you like me to get that for you?
- No. I got it, Sherry.

282
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,849
Who could it be at this time of night?

283
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,102
Just a second!

284
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,938
I wonder who this could be,

285
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,441
surprisin' me this time of evening.

286
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:32,405
I say, I wonder who could be
at my door so late at night.

287
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,742
There's my sugar.

288
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:40,956
You'd better put that nasty-ass tongue
back in your mouth before I rip it out.

289
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,458
Yes, ma'am. My mouth is closed.

290
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,210
But these hands is open for business.

291
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,092
Big Momma, who was it?

292
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,887
Oh, that's just a Bible salesman.

293
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:01,018
- Sherry, let's go back and finish supper.
- You can run, but you can't hide.

294
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,645
Oh, I'm sorry. Ben Rawley's the name.

295
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,106
- Pleased to meet you.
- Sherry.

296
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:10,485
- Big Momma, you didn't say you had a man.
- Child, I ain't got no man.

297
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,822
Why, she got every man in town
sniffin' round like dogs.

298
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,994
- I do?
- Do I smell some greens?

299
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,373
- Yeah, come on in. There's plenty.
- Oh, no!

300
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:25,208
Now, Ben, you know you can't eat no greens.

301
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,711
Greens give you gas somethin' wicked.

302
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:34,467
Last time I had Ben over for greens,
I had to re-wallpaper.

303
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:39,306
- Ben, let me show you to your car.
- Wait a minute!

304
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,308
You look different.

305
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,186
- Different?
- You know, I said the same thing.

306
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,647
That face and those eyes. You've changed.

307
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,904
- Changed?
- Yes, ma'am.

308
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,239
You're gettin' younger every day.

309
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,828
Sherry, say good night to Mr. Rawley.

310
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,709
Good night. Nice to meet you.

311
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,256
Take it easy, Hattie.

312
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,633
Who the hell do you think you are?

313
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:20,556
Comin' up here, tryin' to put your
nasty-ass lips on me. I am not street booty.

314
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,351
I will not be treated like street poontang!

315
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,437
Ben, if you wanna get with me...

316
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,566
I mean... you will never
get with me! Understand?

317
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,571
And even if I was interested,
which I definitely am not,

318
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,115
you be goin' about it the wrong way.

319
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,161
- How am I supposed to go about it?
- You don't come in a woman's house

320
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,663
and lead with your shaboink-boink!

321
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,375
Women don't respond to that.

322
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,169
I should've bought you somethin'.
Like a corsage.

323
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,881
This ain't no damn prom.

324
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,720
Ben, you gotta bring a woman
somethin' special.

325
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,723
Somethin' that means it's from your heart.

326
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,850
Come on. You's a OG, aren't you?

327
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,812
You's a fake one,
but you's probably a OG, huh?

328
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,856
All right, well, get it together.

329
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:16,195
- Thanks, Hattie, baby.
- Good. Get your ass outta here.

330
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,864
Oh, and that seersucker suit?

331
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,817
Sherry made a call today. Who was it?

332
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,821
A Dr Green in Los Angeles.
A refill on the kid's allergy prescription.

333
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,448
She's done nothing to try and contact Lester.

334
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,742
Well, she will. And when she does,

335
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,537
- we'll be there to catch her.
- That's right.

336
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,999
Superfly!

337
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,335
You know?

338
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,963
You wanna give me those,
or have you grown too attached to 'em?

339
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:29,560
"Prescription called in for Trent Pierce."

340
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:34,107
"Hafarth's Pharmacy, Cartersville, Georgia."

341
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,376
I know what you're up to.

342
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,838
You think you're nickel slick,
but I got your penny change.

343
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,925
What you talkin'?
I'm just takin' in a little air.

344
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:05,137
You can't fool an old fool.
Sadie's got it all figured out.

345
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,183
Look, you old bat, this is a federal...

346
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:13,437
The man ain't been here for two days
and you all over him.

347
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:18,484
Oh! You think me and the white...
No, I don't get down like that.

348
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:22,280
Are you drinkin' that corn liquor?
Are you sippin' on the yak?

349
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:25,324
Maybe I have. But somethin's goin' on.

350
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,578
I got my eye on you two.

351
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:32,123
What a day. What a damn day.

352
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:39,297
Big Momma, someone's here to see you.
They say it's an emergency.

353
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,716
Emergency? What kind of emergency?

354
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,761
Your...

355
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,556
Oh, that.

356
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:52,769
Child, when you get to be my age,
they're like yard dogs.

357
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:57,107
If you don't put 'em on a leash,
they'll just roam all over the neighborhood.

358
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,485
- Big Momma, you gotta come out here quick.
- What you talkin'?

359
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,778
- Big Momma, it's time.
- Time for what?

360
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:05,115
Ritha's gonna have her baby.

361
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,867
Oh. That's great. Thank you for stoppin' by.

362
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,746
Be sure to send me an invitation
to the baby shower.

363
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,582
Her water broke comin' back from the movie.
The baby's due any minute.

364
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,043
- And you got to deliver it.
- Excuse me?

365
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:20,380
- You're the midwife, aren't you?
- Midwife?

366
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,927
Big Momma!

367
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,096
- What are you doing?
- Screamin'!

368
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,723
I find that it calms the spirit.

369
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,185
Matter of fact, let's all scream.

370
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,191
Good. See? It works.

371
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,610
It's not like... I don’t know what I'm doin'.

372
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,237
Take it easy. I've called the paramedics.

373
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,116
Just stall, and then get out of the way
when they get there. OK?

374
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,118
All right. Excuse me, darlin'.

375
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:54,247
Let's close these, OK? You don't want
your business wavin' all in the air.

376
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,082
Oh, no! Don't!

377
00:31:56,166 --> 00:32:00,087
- I said close 'em!
- They don't close!

378
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,632
Well, then, maybe that's how
you got this way in the first place!

379
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:06,301
- Get this baby out of me!
- Where is she?

380
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,929
- Just breathe, sweetie.
- Thank God you're here.

381
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,098
Listen, child. You do
what the paramedic says. OK?

382
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:15,143
Big Momma gonna be in the kitchen...
bakin' up a storm.

383
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,187
- Bakin'?
- Paramedic?

384
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,857
Nolan is a security guard
at the lumberyard.

385
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,569
Head security guard. I got two men
and three dogs workin' up under me.

386
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,238
How you doin'? I'm Nolan, Ritha's brother.

387
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:30,200
- Paramedics? Is something wrong?
- No!

388
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,245
I knew it. I told you this senile old hag
was gettin' too old to be doin' this.

389
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,249
Who are you callin' senile?
You wanna step outside?

390
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,460
Look, I took CPR.
Can't be too much harder than that.

391
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,755
Damn! That's a baby.

392
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:46,675
Will you shut up, please?
Big Momma can handle this. Get outta here!

393
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,220
Big Momma's here, darlin'. Don't worry.

394
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:53,849
OK, now. Nolan, get your chunky ass in gear
and find me some hot water.

395
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,850
Lena, I need towels. Lots of towels.

396
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,353
- Towels.
- Now somebody get me some lard.

397
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,147
Preferably Crisco.

398
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,191
We got a baby about to slide into the world.

399
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,278
- Hold my hand, Big Momma.
- Hold her hand.

400
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:10,115
Hold my hand! Hold my hand!

401
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:15,078
OK, you're doin' good.

402
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,288
I'm doin' good.

403
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:19,208
What they need Crisco for?

404
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,126
They use Crisco for everything here.

405
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:25,047
I can't breathe.

406
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:27,716
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,802
- I saw this in a movie once.
- Stop, Big Momma!

408
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:34,181
- Here are the tongs.
- Is that sterilized?

409
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:37,142
Oh, yeah. I used WD-40
and some Easy Off on it.

410
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:40,521
Big Momma, we're not frying a chicken!

411
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,606
Give me this plunger.

412
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,232
Here we go.

413
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:56,620
- Look at the head.
- I see something.

414
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,874
- The head?
- I don't know. I'm lookin', it's lookin' back!

415
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:01,375
For God's sake.

416
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:04,253
Big Momma, what you doin' now?

417
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,756
I don't think you need those, Big Momma.

418
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:10,050
Hold your breath.

419
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,682
It's a girl!

420
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,893
Oh, Lord!

421
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,355
Ritha, it look like Leroy.

422
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,525
Thank you, Big Momma.

423
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,572
Look at her.

424
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,658
She's somethin' else.

425
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,500
Gimme my baby.

426
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:49,632
That's a baby.

427
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:58,516
Good night, Big Momma.

428
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:01,477
Let me tell you...

429
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,484
Big Momma, you were amazing.

430
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,611
Oh, thank you, child.

431
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:13,447
- I wonder what they'll name him.
- I don't know.

432
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:18,244
If it was a boy, they could have named it,
like... Requan or Trevon.

433
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,329
- Trevon is cute.
- You think that?

434
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:22,539
But it's a girl. You gotta pick a girl name.

435
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,709
Shaniqua.

436
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:27,253
- You don't like that?
- Come on now, Big Momma.

437
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:29,421
It should be a biblical name, right?

438
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:32,300
- Something beautiful like that.
- That's right.

439
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,556
Big Momma, do you remember this?

440
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,477
Oh, my word!

441
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:44,978
Yes.

442
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:48,816
- Here.
- Sherry, no. No, I couldn't, Sherry.

443
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:54,072
Big Momma, I just wanna make sure that
if I ever have to go away for a long time

444
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,866
you have something to remember me by.

445
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,412
Well, all right.

446
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:07,210
And I know it's a little tarnished, but it's
gotten me through some pretty tough times.

447
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:11,756
Tough times? Sounds like a man's involved.

448
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,260
Somethin' like that.

449
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:21,599
Sherry, you know that old boyfriend
you had, who got in trouble?

450
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:25,519
Whatever happened to him?

451
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:28,773
Oh, Big Momma, that's such a long story.

452
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:33,444
I'd better go check on Trent.

453
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,573
- You need anything?
- I'm fine. Thank you, honey.

454
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:40,201
- Sit out here and catch my breath.
- OK. I understand.

455
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:38,343
Shit!

456
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:30,270
Who are you?

457
00:38:30,353 --> 00:38:32,814
- Excuse me?
- Who are you?

458
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:35,484
Oh, me? I'm sorry.

459
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:40,154
Sometimes I just get so caught up
in my work that I forget things and...

460
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:42,699
I'm Malcolm. Hi. How are you?

461
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:48,121
Big Momma asked me to come by and fix...

462
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:51,249
- At 5.45 in the morning?
- No doubt.

463
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,585
I'm an electrician. You know?

464
00:38:55,128 --> 00:38:56,922
Shit!

465
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,970
You're not really an electrician, are you?

466
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:07,891
No. No, I'm the...

467
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:10,144
You got me. I am busted.

468
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:14,856
I didn't go to electrical college,
if that's what you mean.

469
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:17,818
But I'm a handyman.
Yeah, handyman's my thing.

470
00:39:17,901 --> 00:39:20,737
- What are you doing?
- How you doin', man?

471
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:22,822
Wait a minute.

472
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:25,742
Trent?

473
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:27,869
How did you know his name?

474
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:30,706
Big Momma been braggin'
all over town about you.

475
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:33,667
- She has not.
- Yes, she has.

476
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,047
"Trent's so smart.
Trent's so cute. Trent knows karate."

477
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:43,134
- I know a little bit.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

478
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,262
Show me a little bit of your moves.

479
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:53,187
I'd love to show him.
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.

480
00:39:58,525 --> 00:40:00,110
What the hell is he doing?

481
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:09,536
- Trent, baby, be careful.
- You're kinda quick.

482
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,915
Let me show you what I got.
Which way I'm comin'?

483
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:19,880
OK, it just got serious.

484
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:22,216
Honey, careful.

485
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:30,099
- Trent, honey, you cannot be that rough.
- You're only a pre-teen.

486
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:33,810
Why don't you come inside now
and let this man finish his work?

487
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,772
- See you later, Trent.
- Bye.

488
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:39,983
I used to take a little karate myself.

489
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,611
OK, I'm gonna go inside now.

490
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:47,741
I'll come back and check on you in a while
just to make sure you haven't killed yourself.

491
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:50,828
I appreciate it.

492
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,835
You blew your cover.

493
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:00,295
John, if you was thinkin' straight,

494
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:03,924
you'd realize Malcolm's our best shot
for crackin' this case.

495
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:07,845
Sherry ain't never gonna
tell her grandmother about Lester.

496
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,389
Hurry up, man. She's leaving.

497
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:12,850
I'll search the house while you're gone.

498
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:18,606
Sherry?

499
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:20,566
Where are you off to?

500
00:41:20,649 --> 00:41:23,193
I'm dropping Trent off to play basketball.

501
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:26,655
And then... I'm just gonna
go into town for a little bit.

502
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:30,952
OK. Well, good. I'll go with you.
I need to do some shopping anyway.

503
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:33,954
- No!
- Trent, move over.

504
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:36,915
This ass here could do some serious damage.

505
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,961
Sherry, I'm not on your gearshift, am l?

506
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:43,088
- No, Big Momma. You're all right.
- All right.

507
00:41:43,172 --> 00:41:45,425
Get your seat belt on.

508
00:41:45,508 --> 00:41:49,178
Here we go on our way to the store.

509
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:04,735
Shit.

510
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:17,665
- Hattie! I've been lookin' for you.
- Well, good. Keep lookin'.

511
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:21,210
Big Momma, stay and talk to your friend.
I'll talk to you later. OK?

512
00:42:21,294 --> 00:42:23,337
- Wait!
- I'll be right back.

513
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:25,798
Hattie, I need to do this
before I lose my nerve.

514
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,593
You run along or that ain't all you gonna lose.

515
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:31,012
Listen. Hattie, listen to me.

516
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:37,185
It was my mother's.
It's been on my dresser for 30 years.

517
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:42,357
Just sittin' in my little apartment doin' nothin'
when it could have been out seein' the world.

518
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,442
I just want to give you somethin',

519
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:47,988
just to prove to you
I know how to give my heart to a woman.

520
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:51,699
- There you are!
- Girl, we've been lookin' all over for you.

521
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:54,285
Hattie!

522
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,538
Hold on a minute. You losin' weight?

523
00:42:57,538 --> 00:43:00,624
Yeah. I been workin'
with that new ab roller.

524
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,544
With the handles up here.

525
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:05,254
Well, sugar, it workin'. You understand me?

526
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:07,923
- Come on now. We gonna be late.
- Late for what?

527
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:15,639
Maybe you're in a dark alley.

528
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:17,725
Maybe not.

529
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:21,103
Maybe you're walkin' home
from a church social.

530
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:25,942
Maybe you're standin' on your sun porch
smokin' a pack of Virginia Slims.

531
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:28,319
But where's an' ever you be,

532
00:43:29,028 --> 00:43:31,114
you got to be prepared for this.

533
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:38,913
That was a little fast. Let me do it again.

534
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:41,833
Come on, Gertrude. This is good for you.

535
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:50,132
Don't you think you're being
a little rough on the ladies?

536
00:43:51,843 --> 00:43:53,803
You think a mugger'll be easy on you?

537
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:59,142
Somebody attack you on the street, you think
they gonna do it delicately? I don't think so.

538
00:43:59,226 --> 00:44:00,560
Now, where were we?

539
00:44:00,644 --> 00:44:03,688
I think you were gonna ask
for another volunteer.

540
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:07,150
And, personally,
I would consider it a privilege.

541
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:11,487
OK. Let's go with some real-life situations.

542
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,367
All right. Now, first off...

543
00:44:16,075 --> 00:44:18,077
Go on. Stand right there.

544
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:20,580
Here?

545
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:23,917
Let's say

546
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,130
you walkin' down the street,
struttin' your stuff,

547
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:31,007
and somebody scream out
to you "Hey, baby!"

548
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,303
"Back that thing up and show me
what you got." What you gonna do?

549
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:37,806
Well, I'd say...

550
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,849
I got a size ten,

551
00:44:39,932 --> 00:44:43,478
and I'm about to cram it up his bony ass.

552
00:44:43,562 --> 00:44:45,897
What if that don't work?

553
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,234
What if he decide he still wanna
get a little piece of that?

554
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:53,363
All he got to do is this.

555
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,794
You done messed up now.

556
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:14,676
Get him, Hattie Mae!

557
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:21,599
Sorry about that. I didn't think it made
much sense to defend myself delicately.

558
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:41,536
Most attackers seek out people
who look like they can't defend themselves.

559
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,124
- Ain't that right, Nolan?
- Yes.

560
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:48,293
See, you only got a second

561
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:51,797
to turn fear and panic into power!

562
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,549
- Power!
- That's right. You can't be scared.

563
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:56,635
You got to fight back.

564
00:45:56,718 --> 00:45:59,388
There you are! I've been
looking all over for you.

565
00:46:10,065 --> 00:46:12,401
I know I got some explainin' to do.

566
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:18,114
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

567
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:20,868
I paid way too much for this new wig
to mess it up here.

568
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:25,038
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- I feel free!

569
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:27,541
Hattie, are you done with him?

570
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:30,419
- Can I have a go?
- Most definitely.

571
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:32,754
Oh, my damn.

572
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:34,256
OK, ladies...

573
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,634
Big Momma, what is going on?

574
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:58,591
- They make these cars so low.
- Hi, Trent. Momma, you need some help?

575
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,886
No, I'm not that old, Sherry.
I don't need no help.

576
00:48:02,428 --> 00:48:04,722
- How you doin'?
- Good.

577
00:48:04,806 --> 00:48:06,807
How was basketball?

578
00:48:06,891 --> 00:48:10,310
- It was all right.
- You OK? I'm gonna go start dinner.

579
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:13,898
And make sure you put
the fatback in the greens.

580
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,151
Hey. This yours.

581
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:23,365
You didn't know Big Momma
knew that move, did you?

582
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:27,203
That's called an assist.

583
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:32,499
Trent, me and you haven't had much time
to just sit down and talk.

584
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:37,046
Your momma didn't happen
to talk to you about

585
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:40,258
where you were going to next, did she?

586
00:48:40,341 --> 00:48:44,720
She didn't happen to say anything
about meetin' up with an old friend?

587
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:46,555
I don't know.

588
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:52,144
Trent, you know I'm your Big Momma, right?

589
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:55,607
You could talk to me and confide in me.
You know that, right?

590
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,402
I said I don't know. And anyway,
Momma said we shouldn't tell our business.

591
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:03,364
That some stuff we should
just keep to ourselves.

592
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:06,117
Is that right?

593
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:17,295
Did somethin' happen
while you were down at basketball?

594
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,340
- The older guys were mean to me.
- Say what?

595
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:23,885
They kicked me off the court.

596
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:27,930
No, see, I knew it.
Don't nobody mess with my babies.

597
00:49:28,013 --> 00:49:32,810
Who do they think they are, kicking you
off the court? That is a public court.

598
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:36,105
Let me go get my nine, OK?
Oh, no. I'll keep that...

599
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,775
You know what, Trent? Let me calm down.

600
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:43,738
How about we take a little walk
down to the park?

601
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,089
Thank you! Get off the court, suckers.

602
00:50:03,507 --> 00:50:05,427
Is that all you got?

603
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,097
Well, get ready to sit down,
cos you ain't gonna last long once we start.

604
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,057
Ain't that right, Trent?

605
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:14,394
- So, Granny thinks she got game?
- Oh, yes. I got game.

606
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:16,646
Got two words, too: I'm back.

607
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:19,274
- You're too fat to be ballin'.
- Say what?

608
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:22,443
You look like a damn shaved bird.

609
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:24,487
Look at you. Just fly your...

610
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,949
Never mind, young man.
I'm not even gonna get into it with you.

611
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:31,369
- Man, here's your rock.
- Didn't know I could catch that, huh?

612
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:34,164
Back at ya! Didn't know
it was comin'. Let's do this.

613
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,667
Come on, little man.
We gonna take you to school.

614
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,812
We own that ball.

615
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,452
Pickin' on a little man. I'm at ya.

616
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:19,209
Look at ya now. Runnin' your mouth.

617
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,882
What you gonna do, Grandma?

618
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,730
What the hell...?

619
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:45,485
Game point.

620
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,492
- Damn!
- Air Momma!

621
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,499
- That's game.
- Yes!

622
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,002
We won!

623
00:52:04,338 --> 00:52:06,465
Yes! We won!

624
00:52:06,548 --> 00:52:08,508
We won! Oh yes, baby!

625
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:13,931
I'm so happy! We won!

626
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:25,401
It smells good, Big Momma.

627
00:52:25,484 --> 00:52:27,611
- Morning, Sherry.
- Good morning.

628
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,863
Trent wanted waffles. Have a seat.

629
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,492
- No, I'm gonna have some toast.
- OK.

630
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:36,870
Malcolm's been askin' about you.

631
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,872
- Really?
- Yes.

632
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:42,960
He was wonderin' how long
you were gonna be in town.

633
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:48,298
He thought you might be meetin' up
with some old friends from California.

634
00:52:48,757 --> 00:52:51,301
I wonder what would make him think that.

635
00:52:51,384 --> 00:52:53,387
Maybe somethin' you said?

636
00:52:54,221 --> 00:53:00,686
Sherry, if you gonna be in town for a while,
you oughta spend some time with that boy.

637
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,313
Get to know him.

638
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:06,066
You really think he's gonna solve
all my problems, don't you?

639
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:10,029
Oh, yeah. Child, if I was 40 years younger

640
00:53:11,113 --> 00:53:15,910
and able to walk down the street
without trippin' over my own breasts,

641
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:19,413
yes, I'd take him on. I'd give him a taste.

642
00:53:20,122 --> 00:53:22,124
Oh, shoot!

643
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,376
Damn.

644
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,629
- Got a little jam on ya?
- Yeah. I just washed this, too.

645
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:30,049
Big Momma, do you have any soda water?

646
00:53:32,593 --> 00:53:35,262
Yeah. Top shelf, Sherry.

647
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:38,557
Oh, my damn!

648
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,271
- What's wrong, Big Momma?
- Stains.

649
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:48,650
I hate stains because they's hard to get out,
and that's a jammy-jam stain. I know.

650
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:03,958
- Hey, Malcolm.
- Hey, little man. What you up to?

651
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:07,795
We're goin' fishin'.
Mom's gonna let me drive the boat.

652
00:54:09,922 --> 00:54:14,051
- How you doin', Sherry?
- Here to empty out the septic tank?

653
00:54:14,135 --> 00:54:15,678
You got jokes.

654
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:20,099
No. Actually, I was in the neighborhood,
so I was just stopping by.

655
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:22,184
Malcolm, you ever gone fishing?

656
00:54:22,268 --> 00:54:27,106
Oh, yeah. I fish in the neighborhood
all the time. Yeah, I know a thing or two.

657
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:30,734
- Really?
- Yes, really.

658
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:33,112
I do all kind of fishing.

659
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:37,533
I just haven't caught anything
worth holding onto.

660
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:39,744
Maybe you're using the wrong bait.

661
00:54:39,827 --> 00:54:41,996
What kind of bait should I be using?

662
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,039
Mom?

663
00:54:44,123 --> 00:54:46,042
Can Malcolm come with us?

664
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:49,837
Sweetie, I'm sure Malcolm has
more important things to do today.

665
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,214
- Actually, I don't.
- Come on, Malcolm.

666
00:54:52,297 --> 00:54:55,092
Mom doesn't know what she's doin'.

667
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:58,679
I could show you where all the hot spots are.

668
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,808
Sure. I don't see why not.

669
00:55:02,892 --> 00:55:06,729
- Come on, Malcolm. I've never been fishing.
- Never?

670
00:55:07,564 --> 00:55:08,815
Nothin' to it.

671
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:25,456
- Mom, did you see that fish jump?
- I did. Looked like he was smiling at us.

672
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:28,418
- Like he was laughing.
- Laughing at Malcolm.

673
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,631
- That's funny?
- No, I mean...

674
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:37,176
Look at your pole!

675
00:55:39,428 --> 00:55:41,222
Give me the camera.

676
00:55:42,766 --> 00:55:45,393
Hold still. Gotcha!

677
00:55:46,936 --> 00:55:49,689
Are you OK? Do you need a hand?

678
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,821
Oh, man!

679
00:56:00,992 --> 00:56:02,785
- There you go.
- Thank you.

680
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:05,622
- Put that on you. A little nippy, huh?
- Yeah.

681
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:10,877
You know, there's...
something about your eyes.

682
00:56:10,961 --> 00:56:13,463
I don't know. They're really familiar.

683
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:17,634
I know you think you can recognize my eyes.

684
00:56:17,717 --> 00:56:22,305
But you know what? A lot of people
have these eyes. These ain't even mine.

685
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:26,935
I borrowed 'em from a friend,
and I gotta have 'em back by dusk.

686
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,228
Yeah, I'll be... Plop!

687
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:32,149
Hold your hoe. Gotta go.

688
00:56:32,232 --> 00:56:35,526
Then you don't have much time.

689
00:56:40,323 --> 00:56:42,283
He loves it out here.

690
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:45,369
It's a great place to grow up.
You should know that.

691
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:48,039
Yeah, but you forget and you move on

692
00:56:48,123 --> 00:56:52,543
and your life takes you places
that you never thought you'd go.

693
00:56:54,129 --> 00:56:56,965
Where has your life taken you?

694
00:56:57,048 --> 00:57:00,635
Far away from here.
And I'm not sure if I'm goin' back.

695
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:01,970
Really?

696
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:04,931
Mom! I can't catch anything.

697
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:08,310
Keep trying, sweetie.

698
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,147
Sherry, your last boyfriend...

699
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,484
What was he like?

700
00:57:20,279 --> 00:57:22,949
Most people aren't who they say they are.

701
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:28,705
Yeah, well, you gotta
trust somebody sometime.

702
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:32,167
Why not start with me?

703
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:35,462
- Mom!
- They're too fast for you, Trent.

704
00:57:35,546 --> 00:57:39,257
- Why don't you just take a break, OK?
- You don't have to be fast.

705
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:43,929
What you got there?

706
00:57:44,387 --> 00:57:48,349
Let me help you with that, little Trent.
Let me see that.

707
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,438
Sometimes, when you wanna
catch somethin',

708
00:57:55,189 --> 00:57:57,192
you just gotta slow down.

709
00:57:59,152 --> 00:58:01,154
Be patient.

710
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:08,411
Then they might come to you.

711
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,124
Thanks, Malcolm.

712
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,961
That's what I do... catch the lightnin' bug.

713
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,225
I see you're a man of great taste.
Need anything else?

714
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:34,438
Laptop? Cameras? AK-47? Stereos?

715
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:36,690
Rolex?

716
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:38,734
Guess not.

717
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:43,321
- I'll take it.
- Great. That'll be two hundred.

718
00:58:45,323 --> 00:58:46,950
Your girl told me a hundred.

719
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:50,245
I don't care what she said.
That gun'll cost you two.

720
00:59:02,549 --> 00:59:06,219
Two hundred, or this transaction
goes real bad, real quick.

721
00:59:14,478 --> 00:59:17,189
It just went bad, didn't it?

722
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:19,482
Pull it.

723
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,743
A hundred's good.

724
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,828
I can do a hundred.

725
00:59:51,307 --> 00:59:53,892
- Thank you.
- Good night.

726
01:00:29,136 --> 01:00:32,640
Yes, sir. I understand, sir.

727
01:00:32,723 --> 01:00:34,892
Oh, no. Sure, I can handle him.

728
01:00:34,975 --> 01:00:38,438
Yeah. Don't you worry.
He knows exactly what he's doing.

729
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:39,605
Bye.

730
01:00:39,689 --> 01:00:42,441
- What the hell are you doing?.
- Don't start.

731
01:00:42,524 --> 01:00:47,863
No, Malcolm, I loved the little Jerry Maguire
moment with the kid. That was very touching.

732
01:00:47,947 --> 01:00:51,825
It might make it a little awkward
when it's time to arrest her, but...

733
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,538
John, my attraction to her
is strictly professional.

734
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:58,540
- Great.
- And trust me: she's innocent.

735
01:00:58,624 --> 01:01:02,753
And that's based on what?
Your "professional" attraction to her?

736
01:01:04,421 --> 01:01:06,883
- Everybody freeze!
- Goddamn! You freeze!

737
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:10,219
Damn! Y'all cut Big Momma up
into little pieces.

738
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:17,476
- Oh, shit!
- Nobody's done nothin' to Big Momma.

739
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:19,853
FBl.

740
01:01:19,937 --> 01:01:22,773
Looks like we'll have to arrest this guy now.

741
01:01:23,065 --> 01:01:25,818
Shit, man, you ain't gotta do that.

742
01:01:25,901 --> 01:01:30,114
I'm a fellow law-enforcement officer myself.
You know, maybe I can help.

743
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:32,199
Get up. Come on.

744
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:35,328
- OK, OK.
- All right.

745
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:37,538
Now, I've gone undercover as Big Momma.

746
01:01:37,622 --> 01:01:39,457
As you can see.

747
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,584
That what that is?

748
01:01:41,668 --> 01:01:42,919
Yeah.

749
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:47,047
Now listen, Nolan. This is top-secret.
We're after a hardened criminal.

750
01:01:47,131 --> 01:01:49,259
What I need you to do is stake out the bank.

751
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:51,928
- Can you handle that?
- No problem.

752
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:55,389
All right. Now, what I'm saying is,
shut your mouth on this one.

753
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:58,559
I mean it - hush. Don't say nothin'. Nada.

754
01:01:59,685 --> 01:02:01,937
You with me? All right.

755
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:06,651
If you can do that, we might
find a place for you on the force.

756
01:02:06,734 --> 01:02:08,903
- You'd be in.
- In the Bureau?

757
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:10,655
Right in the Bureau.

758
01:02:10,738 --> 01:02:14,950
Probably you'd get the F, but you won't
get the BI until some years have gone by.

759
01:02:15,034 --> 01:02:17,912
- Right. Cos there's some work involved.
- Exactly.

760
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:20,665
Like the bank work. I'm all over it!

761
01:02:20,748 --> 01:02:23,584
- Bye.
- Hot damn!

762
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,317
Trent?

763
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:28,275
Big Momma?

764
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:31,361
- You awake?
- Yes, Sherry.

765
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:33,446
Is everything all right?

766
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:36,700
Oh, yeah. I was just coming
to check you were OK with...

767
01:03:40,119 --> 01:03:42,122
I'm sorry.

768
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:44,207
That scared me.

769
01:03:48,545 --> 01:03:50,589
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

770
01:03:50,672 --> 01:03:52,674
That's good.

771
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:03,101
I remember when I was a little girl
and it used to storm like this

772
01:04:03,185 --> 01:04:05,729
and you would wrap your arms around me.

773
01:04:07,355 --> 01:04:09,315
- You mean like this?
- Yeah.

774
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:15,321
And I just felt like
nothing in the world could ever hurt me.

775
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:17,532
Doesn't this feel so good?

776
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:21,786
It feels so damn good.

777
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:30,796
- Big Momma?
- Yes?

778
01:04:30,879 --> 01:04:33,048
- What's that?
- What's what?

779
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,842
That.

780
01:04:37,302 --> 01:04:38,429
It's...

781
01:04:38,512 --> 01:04:40,889
That's just my flashlight.

782
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:45,978
The storm knocked out all the power and...
I had to get a big old flashlight.

783
01:04:46,061 --> 01:04:48,063
OK.

784
01:04:52,901 --> 01:04:55,695
- You OK?
- Yes. Just tryin' to get comfortable.

785
01:04:55,779 --> 01:04:57,739
All right.

786
01:04:57,822 --> 01:05:01,910
- Let's try to get some sleep.
- That's easy for you to say.

787
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:13,255
You know, when I called you the other day,
I didn't think you'd even wanna talk to me.

788
01:05:13,339 --> 01:05:15,674
Why would you say that, Sherry?

789
01:05:15,757 --> 01:05:19,344
Well, it's been a long time
since we've talked,

790
01:05:19,427 --> 01:05:22,055
and I'm not a little girl any more.

791
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:28,437
And I know that you've probably heard
some things that I'm not very proud of.

792
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:33,650
Well... Maybe I didn't wanna
believe those things.

793
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:37,487
Maybe I only wanted
to believe the best about you.

794
01:05:39,823 --> 01:05:42,243
You sure have changed, Big Momma.

795
01:05:44,036 --> 01:05:45,954
How so?

796
01:05:46,037 --> 01:05:50,584
Shoot, when I was a little girl,
you'd whup my butt if I even looked guilty.

797
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:54,087
Well, it got your hind parts
in shape, didn't it?

798
01:05:56,882 --> 01:05:59,760
Well, you learned your lesson.

799
01:05:59,843 --> 01:06:02,471
Yeah, I learned how to look innocent.

800
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:08,101
- Big Momma...
- Yes?

801
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:12,106
Is there another flashlight under there?

802
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,751
Hi.

803
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,836
What the hell are you doing here?

804
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:37,005
- Somebody may see you.
- No worries about that.

805
01:06:37,088 --> 01:06:39,091
I got Nolan watching the perimeter.

806
01:06:39,175 --> 01:06:43,261
He'd like his own gun, and he wants to know
if we can use secret code names.

807
01:06:43,345 --> 01:06:46,515
- You better watch him.
- Oh? And who's gonna watch you?

808
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:50,435
- What are you talkin' about?
- You slept with her, man. She got to you.

809
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:55,357
- I didn't sleep with her. Big Momma did.
- OK. Thanks for the visual.

810
01:06:55,441 --> 01:06:56,859
You know what I mean.

811
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:59,695
Are you puttin' on your make-up
in the dark now?

812
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:01,530
Big Momma?

813
01:07:02,615 --> 01:07:06,619
- Come on, Big Momma. We're gonna be late.
- Late? Late for what?

814
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:09,538
Church. We're leaving in five minutes.

815
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:17,588
OK, maybe she got to me. But believe me,
this will not affect my work on this case.

816
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:22,968
That big bag she took downtown
the other day.

817
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:25,846
- Yeah?
- She didn't come back with that, did she?

818
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:30,476
Not affect your work. Fine.

819
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:39,234
You know, Malcolm, if you wanna
save this girl, then that's fine.

820
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:42,321
But you gotta get her to confess everything,

821
01:07:42,405 --> 01:07:46,575
or else, when we catch Lester,
she's gonna go down with him.

822
01:08:23,696 --> 01:08:27,241
"Every Time I Feel The Spirit."

823
01:08:27,325 --> 01:08:29,201
Yes, good people,

824
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:32,413
we are not havin' service this morning.

825
01:08:33,873 --> 01:08:36,125
This morning, we're havin' church!

826
01:08:38,211 --> 01:08:42,548
You know, the Lord got me
to thinking the other day that

827
01:08:42,631 --> 01:08:46,344
maybe it's time that I stopped preaching

828
01:08:47,678 --> 01:08:50,514
and started listening!

829
01:08:51,683 --> 01:08:54,685
And maybe one of our saints here

830
01:08:55,686 --> 01:08:59,149
could offer us a word from above.

831
01:08:59,232 --> 01:09:01,109
All right!

832
01:09:01,192 --> 01:09:04,445
Earlier this week, I went to my phone

833
01:09:05,113 --> 01:09:08,616
and the Lord took my dialing finger.

834
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:12,204
- And after about three rings...
- Three rings!

835
01:09:15,873 --> 01:09:17,375
I heard

836
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,337
a sweet, angelic voice say...

837
01:09:23,381 --> 01:09:26,968
Boy, you better get that thing outta my face.
Move, Rev! Go now.

838
01:09:27,385 --> 01:09:30,054
That's right. It was Hattie Mae Pierce.

839
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:37,312
- Saints, we can learn a lot from this lady.
- Yes, we can.

840
01:09:37,395 --> 01:09:42,400
For she has been to sorrow's kitchen

841
01:09:42,817 --> 01:09:44,777
and licked the pot clean.

842
01:09:47,447 --> 01:09:49,491
Are you ready to testify?

843
01:09:53,452 --> 01:09:57,999
Oh, well, I guess I could say a few words.

844
01:09:58,082 --> 01:09:59,917
Go, Big Momma!

845
01:10:01,837 --> 01:10:04,547
You just put me on the spot today, Reverend.

846
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:08,259
I really wasn't expectin' this, Reverend.

847
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:10,303
Well, let's see.

848
01:10:10,387 --> 01:10:13,306
- You know what to say.
- Come on with it.

849
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:16,435
Let's see.

850
01:10:16,518 --> 01:10:19,437
Well, I asked him. I said "Lord,

851
01:10:20,063 --> 01:10:24,067
should I talk about the evils

852
01:10:24,484 --> 01:10:26,486
of drugs?"

853
01:10:26,778 --> 01:10:29,280
No, no, no!

854
01:10:29,363 --> 01:10:32,033
Big Momma don't know
nothin' about no drugs.

855
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:35,870
Unless y'all talkin' about Harry Belafonte.

856
01:10:35,953 --> 01:10:39,624
Lord knows I was addicted
to that man for about ten years.

857
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:45,797
So, anyway, what I'm here to say is

858
01:10:45,881 --> 01:10:48,883
that some of us

859
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,138
Live secret lives.

860
01:10:53,972 --> 01:10:57,810
We don't want people to know the real us.

861
01:10:58,811 --> 01:11:01,896
We hide behind our smiles

862
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,065
and polite conversation.

863
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,069
And underneath it all,
we do a lotta nasty shit.

864
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:12,366
'Scuse me, Reverend.

865
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:15,744
So sorry about that.

866
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:19,331
Anyway, we've all sinned.

867
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,293
Lord knows I've sinned.

868
01:11:23,418 --> 01:11:25,420
I've lusted in my heart.

869
01:11:25,503 --> 01:11:28,131
In my living room.

870
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:31,718
In the hot tub at the Red Roof Inn.

871
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:34,096
Oh, and in the back of an EI Camino!

872
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:36,473
Watch out there, now.

873
01:11:36,556 --> 01:11:41,937
But that's neither here nor there.
OK, please, disregard that last one.

874
01:11:42,854 --> 01:11:45,940
Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that

875
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,902
our secrets...

876
01:11:50,112 --> 01:11:52,364
they eat away at us.

877
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:58,245
So, if we want to be protected - hear me now -

878
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:03,667
we got to confess everything.

879
01:12:05,836 --> 01:12:08,088
Because the truth

880
01:12:09,548 --> 01:12:11,383
shall set you free.

881
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:20,017
And when that day happens,

882
01:12:21,142 --> 01:12:24,730
- won't it be a happy day?
- That's your song.

883
01:13:39,972 --> 01:13:41,807
Hallelujah!

884
01:13:53,945 --> 01:13:57,323
- OK, we're home.
- My bladder got me just runnin'.

885
01:13:57,406 --> 01:14:00,284
Maybe I should come in for a little nightcap.

886
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:02,370
Consider your night capped.

887
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:08,918
- You hear somethin'?
- What?

888
01:14:19,637 --> 01:14:21,638
Freeze!

889
01:14:21,722 --> 01:14:23,266
Surprise!

890
01:14:26,977 --> 01:14:28,437
Surprise.

891
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,815
Surprise, Big Momma.

892
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:33,943
I don't think Big Momma
likes surprise parties.

893
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:37,071
Let's eat.

894
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:40,991
Big Momma, where did you get that from?

895
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:46,789
Come on, why don't you give it to me?
Give it up before you hurt somebody, OK?

896
01:14:46,872 --> 01:14:50,293
- I'm about to go secure the perimeter.
- Nolan!

897
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:55,339
- John...
- This is all we need. Him screwing this up.

898
01:14:55,423 --> 01:15:00,678
- Why'd you let all these people in here?
- It's a surprise party. I didn't know about it.

899
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:04,641
Keep your eyes open.
I'm goin' upstairs to change for the party.

900
01:15:04,724 --> 01:15:06,392
Good idea.

901
01:15:24,994 --> 01:15:27,330
Hi, Ben. How you doin'?

902
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:30,625
I guess you're wonderin'
what I got you for your birthday.

903
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:33,295
Don't tell me
your momma had more jewellery.

904
01:15:33,378 --> 01:15:36,172
If you don't want it, you don't have to...

905
01:15:39,008 --> 01:15:40,969
What is that boy up to now, Big Momma?

906
01:15:41,052 --> 01:15:44,097
You stay down here
and watch the food. I'll go up.

907
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:46,140
All right.

908
01:15:56,442 --> 01:15:59,070
Trent? What are you lookin' for?

909
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:00,739
Nothing.

910
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,160
Why don't you go downstairs
and help your momma with the food?

911
01:16:06,244 --> 01:16:08,622
Yes, ma'am.

912
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:28,099
Damn.

913
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,006
Big Momma?

914
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,382
Yes?

915
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:05,512
Where'd you put the sweet corn?
Is it outside in the freezer?

916
01:17:05,595 --> 01:17:09,224
Sherry, is there anything
you wanna say to Big Momma?

917
01:17:09,307 --> 01:17:11,852
No, Big Momma. Why do you ask?

918
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,938
Oh, really?

919
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:19,651
Then I guess this chain isn't the only thing
that came back to me tarnished.

920
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:29,286
- I found the money, Sherry.
- What money?

921
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:37,794
Oh, my God. It's Lester.

922
01:17:39,505 --> 01:17:41,882
Big Momma, I'm so sorry,

923
01:17:41,965 --> 01:17:45,301
but I gotta go. I gotta get outta here.

924
01:17:45,718 --> 01:17:47,471
Sherry!

925
01:17:55,145 --> 01:17:58,523
Hey, officer. I'm lookin' for...
Miss Hattie Mae Pierce's house.

926
01:17:58,606 --> 01:18:00,901
- You know where she live?
- Big Momma?

927
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:03,403
- Yeah.
- You less than two miles away.

928
01:18:03,487 --> 01:18:05,739
She gonna die when she sees me.

929
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:09,827
Sherry... Now you gonna have to
tell me what's goin' on.

930
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:11,870
- Everything, Sherry.
- I can't.

931
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:16,500
I'm beggin' you to trust me. I mean...
you can trust your Big Momma, can't you?

932
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:20,587
- Now, who's this Lester?
- I thought I was in love with him.

933
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,799
He stole my keys. He got into the vault.
He shot two people.

934
01:18:23,882 --> 01:18:27,677
He must have hid the money in Trent's
locker before they arrested him.

935
01:18:27,761 --> 01:18:30,931
Are you saying you didn't know
anything about the money?

936
01:18:31,014 --> 01:18:34,226
What about that big bag
you had the other day, Sherry?

937
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,937
What about the phone call
you made in town?

938
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:46,780
Happy birthday.

939
01:18:50,868 --> 01:18:54,246
And the phone call was
to set up your surprise party.

940
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:59,918
You're tellin' the truth. You didn't have
anything to do with the robbery.

941
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,754
Of course I did.
I knew that the keys were missing,

942
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:06,967
and I didn't say anything to anybody
because I was afraid I'd lose my job.

943
01:19:07,384 --> 01:19:11,222
Is that it? That's the big mistake
you made, Sherry?

944
01:19:11,305 --> 01:19:14,349
Big Momma, I should have said something.

945
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:17,352
I know what kind of man Lester is.

946
01:19:17,435 --> 01:19:19,438
Oh, Sherry!

947
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:28,072
Big Momma, what are you doing?

948
01:19:28,155 --> 01:19:30,407
Oh, excuse me, child.

949
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:34,245
Sometimes Big Momma just feel like
kissin' folks, that's all.

950
01:19:34,328 --> 01:19:36,330
Well, could you warn me next time?

951
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:38,373
Yeah, sure.

952
01:19:38,457 --> 01:19:40,459
Sherry, listen to me.

953
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,461
You're not to blame.

954
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:46,382
Lester stole the keys. Lester stole the money.

955
01:19:46,716 --> 01:19:48,717
And Lester shot those people.

956
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:56,517
Big Momma, I should have known
I could trust you. Thank you so much.

957
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,603
Everything's gonna be OK. All right?

958
01:20:01,147 --> 01:20:05,609
I'm gonna call Malcolm.
He'll help us fix everything. No worries.

959
01:20:05,818 --> 01:20:07,820
No worries. I'll fix it.

960
01:20:22,502 --> 01:20:24,503
Yes, ma'am!

961
01:20:25,671 --> 01:20:29,967
I've been waitin' on this moment
ever since I first laid eyes on you.

962
01:20:30,051 --> 01:20:32,887
Can't get enough of your love, baby.

963
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,765
Hattie, I'm tired of bein' alone.

964
01:20:35,848 --> 01:20:39,060
Ben, whatever you started in that bed,

965
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:41,353
trust me, you gonna finish alone.

966
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,065
Oh, Hattie baby...

967
01:20:44,148 --> 01:20:47,943
Ben, I swear, if I see your shaboinker,
all hell's gonna break loose.

968
01:20:57,662 --> 01:20:58,996
Holy shit.

969
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:03,668
Good Lord! What in the hell
is goin' on up in there?

970
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:08,297
- Hey, Big Momma.
- Hi, Trent.

971
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:20,893
What in the hell is goin' on over there?

972
01:21:23,729 --> 01:21:26,232
Hey. You're back so soon!

973
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:27,942
What do you mean, "so soon"?

974
01:21:28,025 --> 01:21:30,069
And what the hell's wrong with this door?

975
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:34,365
How about I hop in there
and we go for a spin?

976
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:36,909
Big Momma?

977
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,413
- There you are.
- Everyone's lookin' for you.

978
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:43,207
- What are you doing?
- I'm just freshenin' up.

979
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:46,503
- Come on! Time to cut your cake.
- Everybody's waitin' on you.

980
01:21:46,586 --> 01:21:51,799
Driver, if I give you $20, would you
step outside and kick his ass for me?

981
01:21:51,882 --> 01:21:54,844
- Yes, ma'am.
- No. Sir, you do not have to kick my ass.

982
01:21:54,928 --> 01:21:56,763
Wait a minute. Just wait.

983
01:21:57,388 --> 01:22:00,725
Look. OK, if you really must know,

984
01:22:00,809 --> 01:22:04,687
it's a surprise party for you,
and if you go in there now you'll ruin it.

985
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:07,983
Well, if that’s my party,
looks like I'm missin' it.

986
01:22:08,066 --> 01:22:09,609
Christ.

987
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:34,717
It's so loud in here. Maybe you'd be
more comfortable over at my house.

988
01:22:36,428 --> 01:22:40,640
- We've been lookin' all over for you.
- It's time to cut your birthday cake.

989
01:22:41,015 --> 01:22:43,185
All of this for my birthday?

990
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:48,689
Everybody's all dressed up and looking good.

991
01:22:48,773 --> 01:22:51,735
I wanna freshen up
and get out of my traveling clothes.

992
01:22:51,818 --> 01:22:54,445
No, don't worry about that. You look fine.

993
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:58,533
Listen, I got some dress-up clothes, too.
I wanna put mine on.

994
01:22:59,117 --> 01:23:02,078
Now where's that cake?

995
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:06,291
- Damn!
- That was fast!

996
01:23:08,876 --> 01:23:10,921
What the hell are you doing, Nolan?

997
01:23:11,004 --> 01:23:14,382
Y'all sure went through
a lotta trouble for Big Momma.

998
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:17,719
You know, that's rare these days.

999
01:23:17,803 --> 01:23:21,473
So much else to do
that you forget about people.

1000
01:23:21,556 --> 01:23:23,933
- Big Momma is here.
- What you talking about?

1001
01:23:24,016 --> 01:23:26,895
- She's back. The real Big Momma is back.
- Damn!

1002
01:23:28,146 --> 01:23:30,398
- You want me to take her out?
- No.

1003
01:23:30,481 --> 01:23:34,611
Just keep her away from Malcolm until
we figure out a way to sneak her out of here.

1004
01:23:34,694 --> 01:23:36,779
OK. You got it.

1005
01:23:38,782 --> 01:23:42,035
You know, Big Momma
a whole lotta woman. I may need help.

1006
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:51,419
You two? in my bed?

1007
01:23:51,919 --> 01:23:53,839
Hell, no!

1008
01:23:53,922 --> 01:23:55,924
Hattie Mae, I can explain.

1009
01:23:56,007 --> 01:23:59,010
Explain it to the fat end of my baseball bat.

1010
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:04,307
Trent? Sweetie?

1011
01:24:06,184 --> 01:24:10,188
"Scratch, scratch, scratch,
went the clawing at my door."

1012
01:24:10,272 --> 01:24:15,110
"'Who's there?' I said,
hoping it was only my imagination."

1013
01:24:15,569 --> 01:24:17,946
Mom, look. It's ghost stories.

1014
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:30,209
Where's my Sherry?
Where's my baby Sherry?

1015
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:38,091
- In my house, in my bed...
- Malcolm, I've been lookin' all over for you.

1016
01:24:38,175 --> 01:24:41,177
- You'll never believe who's here.
- Who's here?

1017
01:24:41,594 --> 01:24:46,183
Plenty of fun people. Let's dance over
and meet some, shall we? Come on.

1018
01:24:52,022 --> 01:24:54,024
Sherry?

1019
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:12,418
Big Momma, work it out!

1020
01:25:12,501 --> 01:25:14,503
He don't know what to do with it.

1021
01:25:26,682 --> 01:25:28,475
Shit.

1022
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:32,897
Can I at least say goodbye
to my grandmother?

1023
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,314
Yeah.

1024
01:25:38,444 --> 01:25:40,446
Big Momma?

1025
01:25:42,573 --> 01:25:44,199
Sherry, is that you?

1026
01:25:44,282 --> 01:25:46,577
What a beautiful surprise.

1027
01:25:47,286 --> 01:25:52,250
Yeah, Big Momma. I just wanted to come
and say goodbye, cos we have to leave now.

1028
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,585
But I just got...

1029
01:25:54,668 --> 01:25:58,672
I don't want you to leave.
Please, don't leave.

1030
01:25:58,755 --> 01:26:04,052
No, Big Momma, we have to go now. And I
just wanted to say thank you for everything.

1031
01:26:04,136 --> 01:26:06,472
You said goodbye. Now let's go.

1032
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:09,600
- Freeze, sucker!
- Nolan? What the hell are you doing?

1033
01:26:09,683 --> 01:26:11,351
Put that thing down.

1034
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,857
You freeze... sucker.

1035
01:26:18,192 --> 01:26:20,027
- Don't shoot me.
- Lester, no.

1036
01:26:21,028 --> 01:26:21,988
Oh, shit.

1037
01:26:26,575 --> 01:26:27,869
Oh, Jesus!

1038
01:26:27,952 --> 01:26:30,538
I forgot my keys.

1039
01:26:34,751 --> 01:26:37,545
Big... Big Momma?

1040
01:26:39,463 --> 01:26:42,717
- Are y'all Double mint twins?
- Freeze! FBl.

1041
01:26:49,849 --> 01:26:52,977
Not in Big Momma's house!

1042
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:57,148
Oh, shit!

1043
01:27:03,237 --> 01:27:06,282
I can't feel my knees. Oh, Big Momma!

1044
01:27:06,824 --> 01:27:09,744
- Hit me, you fat piece of junk?
- Lester, no!

1045
01:27:10,787 --> 01:27:12,788
Don't you hit her.

1046
01:27:17,877 --> 01:27:20,296
Don't turn over on me! Oh, Lord!

1047
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:48,241
Oh, man.

1048
01:27:48,324 --> 01:27:49,784
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1049
01:27:49,867 --> 01:27:53,037
- You were all over that shit.
- Yeah. I was somethin', huh?

1050
01:27:53,496 --> 01:27:55,081
Easy.

1051
01:27:55,164 --> 01:27:59,878
But I gotta tell you... This gettin' shot part,
it's not as much fun as you'd think.

1052
01:28:00,336 --> 01:28:02,338
Malcolm.

1053
01:28:05,424 --> 01:28:07,802
Trent.

1054
01:28:10,096 --> 01:28:12,223
Watch out!

1055
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:24,902
Yes. Well, somebody
better tell me somethin',

1056
01:28:24,986 --> 01:28:28,406
cos this sho' is some freaky shit.

1057
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:42,921
Yes, and I'll bust in your head again
if I catch you foolin' around with my kin.

1058
01:28:43,004 --> 01:28:45,006
Blood is thicker than water.

1059
01:28:46,174 --> 01:28:50,136
Is that morphine in there?
God, it beats the hell out of aspirin.

1060
01:28:54,432 --> 01:28:55,809
Sherry.

1061
01:28:59,604 --> 01:29:01,606
Go inside, sweetie. OK?

1062
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:07,570
How's he doin'?

1063
01:29:08,696 --> 01:29:10,532
He's fine.

1064
01:29:11,241 --> 01:29:12,867
Good.

1065
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:16,538
You thought I was guilty
the whole time, didn't you?

1066
01:29:16,788 --> 01:29:19,582
You went to all this trouble
to try to catch me in a lie

1067
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:22,251
and you were the one being dishonest.

1068
01:29:22,752 --> 01:29:24,588
I was just doin' my job.

1069
01:29:24,671 --> 01:29:28,424
So the lake and everything,
that was just you doin' your job, right?

1070
01:29:28,508 --> 01:29:30,009
No.

1071
01:29:30,092 --> 01:29:33,388
"You gotta trust somebody sometime.
Why not start with me?"

1072
01:29:33,722 --> 01:29:36,391
I find that hard to believe, Malcolm.

1073
01:29:55,785 --> 01:29:59,414
How do you feel, Malcolm?
Nervous about your testimony?

1074
01:29:59,498 --> 01:30:01,833
Nervous? No.

1075
01:30:01,917 --> 01:30:03,877
No, I'm cool.

1076
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:07,214
This won't be the first time I've testified.

1077
01:30:07,297 --> 01:30:09,049
This one ain't gettin' away.

1078
01:30:09,132 --> 01:30:11,884
Let's hope. This is your basic
hostile jury. Good luck.

1079
01:30:11,968 --> 01:30:13,971
Yeah. All right.

1080
01:30:26,274 --> 01:30:28,777
Yes, brothers and sisters.

1081
01:30:32,822 --> 01:30:34,825
Reverend, I've come to testify.

1082
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:39,954
- What's he doin' here?
- This is God's house,

1083
01:30:40,038 --> 01:30:42,541
where all of his children are welcome.

1084
01:30:42,749 --> 01:30:45,752
Yeah, maybe all exceptin' him.

1085
01:30:49,131 --> 01:30:51,341
- This better be good, son.
- Yeah.

1086
01:30:51,425 --> 01:30:54,594
Now wobble-wobble, and drop it like it's hot.

1087
01:30:58,807 --> 01:31:01,059
I've come here today to

1088
01:31:01,142 --> 01:31:03,520
ask for understanding.

1089
01:31:05,063 --> 01:31:10,069
I believe the Good Book says
"lf you don't know me, don’t judge me."

1090
01:31:10,152 --> 01:31:12,988
- That was Tupac.
- Definitely Tupac.

1091
01:31:13,071 --> 01:31:14,990
Tupac. All right.

1092
01:31:15,073 --> 01:31:18,243
Well, Trent, what does it say?

1093
01:31:18,327 --> 01:31:22,205
Mom says Jesus said we should
love one another as we love ourselves.

1094
01:31:22,289 --> 01:31:25,918
No, Trent. That's an old lyric from AI Green.
I got it in the car.

1095
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:27,961
Jesus did say that.

1096
01:31:28,044 --> 01:31:30,881
- Amen!
- Yes, he did.

1097
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:34,926
Anyway... Trent, do you remember
that day at the lake

1098
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:38,722
when I told you that
if you wanted something bad enough

1099
01:31:38,806 --> 01:31:41,600
you gotta be patient
and it might come to you?

1100
01:31:42,809 --> 01:31:45,396
Well, I think that only works with fireflies.

1101
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:49,691
But if it's someone important,
you gotta put yourself into it.

1102
01:31:50,192 --> 01:31:52,194
You have to go get it.

1103
01:31:53,112 --> 01:31:55,280
Sherry, the make-up...

1104
01:31:55,364 --> 01:31:57,866
You know, the whole...

1105
01:31:57,949 --> 01:32:00,327
And the protrudeness...

1106
01:32:01,328 --> 01:32:03,121
Excuse me.

1107
01:32:03,205 --> 01:32:05,207
Look, that was fake.

1108
01:32:07,334 --> 01:32:09,753
But what I feel about you...

1109
01:32:10,545 --> 01:32:13,132
That's real.

1110
01:32:13,215 --> 01:32:17,052
You know, Reverend,
I think the Lord is trying to give us

1111
01:32:17,135 --> 01:32:20,389
some true words through this brother here.

1112
01:32:20,473 --> 01:32:23,976
Well, may the angels speed
your path on up here, Big Momma.

1113
01:32:31,733 --> 01:32:34,487
Sherry, why are you still sittin' there?

1114
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:37,614
Girl, come on up here and get your man.

1115
