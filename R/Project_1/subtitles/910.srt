00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,067
Mrs. Yepremian,

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,365
I would like you to meet
my new associate, Dr. Brooks.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,122
-He's here for career day.
-Aw.

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,457
MRS. YEPREMIAN:
He's adorable.

6
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,248
DR. BROOKS: He wants to be a dentist
just like his dad.

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,751
All right, let's see
what's going on in there.

8
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,257
-Oh, boy.
-Ah!

9
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,591
-Dr. Brooks, is this gonna hurt?
-|‘m afraid just a little.

10
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,844
More than a tickle but way less
than paying your taxes.

11
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,843
That's right.

12
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,186
-All right, let's see.

13
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,647
Dr. Brooks!
I think I need a second opinion.

14
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,278
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,649
Son, if you want to be
a great dentist,

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,151
never forget the personal touch.

17
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,488
Here.

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,792
MRS. YEPREMIAN: Ah...

19
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:36,964
Ah!

20
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,993
-Hello, ladies!
-Oh. Hi.

21
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,123
Beautiful day in Miami.

22
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,988
Whoo!

23
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,003
Good morning, fine ladies.

24
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,417
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

25
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,966
-Busy day, doctor.
-Yeah, they all are.

26
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,509
We will be with you all in a while
and we promise to make you smile.

27
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,304
Now, if yourjaw still hurts tonight,
take two pills.

28
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,602
If it still hurts tomorrow, then...

29
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,982
you should probably find
a new dentist.

30
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,018
Huh?

31
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,402
"Find a..."

32
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,117
-|t's a little joke.
-Oh.

33
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,324
Anyway, just call us tomorrow,
let us know how you feel.

34
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,950
-Wow.
-Thank you.

35
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,161
-Sugar cookies.
-Hello, little darling. Hello, you.

36
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,707
-Mom... Hi.
-Teddy bear!

37
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,712
Hi. How are you?
Can I?

38
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,713
Excuse us for a second.

39
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,625
-Enjoy them.
-Come on, Mom.

40
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,261
Mom...

41
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,593
I love that you're involved
in my practice,

42
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,142
but you can't be giving
out sugar cookies in a dental office.

43
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,476
Your father always believed
in the personal touch.

44
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,816
And repeat business.

45
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,102
Hey, T. Got a surprise.

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,316
This guy says
he's an old buddy of yours.

47
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,981
I don't know this man.

48
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,616
Well, I'm Ernesto Julio Raphael Santisto.

49
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,864
-TED: Oh.
-And you've been served.

50
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,831
-Do you validate?
-Oh, no, you got to go.

51
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,658
-Hey, hey, stamp my ticket, man.
-Sure.

52
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,456
-|'m gonna stamp your head.
-Stamp my ticket!

53
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,078
-AMELIA: Ted?

54
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,917
Are you being sued?

55
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,717
Hey, if this is about
that Freeman kid,

56
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:04,967
he's lying.

57
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,005
I mean, okay, maybe I shouldn't have
been drilling left-handed

58
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,764
-but he dared me.
-Would you shut up?

59
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,300
It's about a will.

60
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,843
Phew.

61
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,933
But I definitely think they have
the wrong Theodore Brooks.

62
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,640
It's about some lady in Alaska,
a place called Tolketna.

63
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,521
-RUPERT: Alaska?

64
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,312
They definitely got
the wrong Ted Brooks.

65
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,196
See, they're looking
for the white Ted Brooks.

66
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,024
-Well, her name is Lucy Watkins...

67
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,155
Mom!

68
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,158
Rupert, get her something to drink!

69
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,200
Wait a minute, relax, relax.
Sit down. Breathe, breathe.

70
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,917
Here, rinse and spit.

71
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,754
Oh, Teddy Bear.

72
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,664
How can I?

73
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,334
-How do I?
-How do you what?

74
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,462
Ted...

75
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,258
Teddy...

76
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,063
You're adopted.

77
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,573
AMELIA:
We always meant to tell you

78
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,986
and then your father died...
This doesn't change anything.

79
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,288
I am your mother, no matter what.

80
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,578
You will always be
my teddy bear.

81
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,118
My love. My teddy bear.
My love. My teddy.

82
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,373
RUPERT: Ted!

83
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,883
Ted! Hey, Ted. Come on.
Don't trip on this.

84
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,136
All right?
A lot of people are adopted.

85
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,630
-Famous people.

86
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,717
You know, you got Webster
and Soon-Yi.

87
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,180
And those kids
from Different Strokes.

88
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,599
-They turned out okay.
-I should've known.

89
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,973
-Please.
-There were so many signs.

90
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,265
-Really?

91
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,730
-Yeah, |--
-Like what?

92
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,148
Well...

93
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,272
Like blue cheese!

94
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,650
I love blue cheese,
and they hate it.

95
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,327
Oh! Uncanny.

96
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,163
So how was it living
with strangers?

97
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,884
-Why am | a dentist, Rupert?
-Duh! 'Cause your daddy's a dentist.

98
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,841
Maybe I was meant
to do something different.

99
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,931
Be someone else.

100
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,584
I'm an Eskimo!

101
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,883
-RUPERT: All right, cuz.

102
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,964
-I got you everything you need

103
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,636
for your trip to Alaska.

104
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,765
I'm only going for a couple of days!

105
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,017
Yeah, well, I know you
just wanted a parka, but,

106
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,305
your credit card wanted more.

107
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,975
Oh, I got these shoes for myself.

108
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,479
Whoo! Yeah, ﬂy, right?

109
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,314
-What is all of this, Rupert?
-Okay.

110
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,403
For those cold Alaskan nights,
you know,

111
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,607
other than getting a little na-nooky.

112
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,619
I got you a personal, wearable
warm and cold system.

113
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,204
It's the ultimate climate
control accessory.

114
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,115
But wait, there's more.

115
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,584
There better not be more.

116
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,910
Well...

117
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,043
you're gonna receive a bill
for a massage chair.

118
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,424
-Out!

119
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:32,880
I like that co...

120
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,854
Shut up, Chester! I hate you!

121
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,606
When I bought this condo,

122
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,602
no one told me a little rat
like you lived next door!

123
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,899
I'm so sick
of your barking!

124
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,080
PILOT: Welcome to Anchorage.
We got a real scorcher today.

125
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,116
Expecting a high of three degrees.

126
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,286
WOMAN: As reigning champion,
what have you learned?

127
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,755
MAN: I know that nothing can
be left to chance.

128
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,251
In this race,
man and beast must move as one.

129
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,176
And when I cross the finish line,
nothing refreshes like Powerade,

130
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,764
the only drink on my sled.

131
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,014
MAN OVER P.A.:
Your attention, please.

132
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,431
Final boarding call
for ﬂight 522 to Tolketna.

133
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,849
-Oh! That's me!
- This is the ﬁnal ﬂight

134
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,564
-to Tolketna this month.
-Wait! Hold that plane!

135
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,318
-Wait! Wait! Wait!
-Sir, please! You can't go beyond...

136
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,651
Wait! Wait! Halt! No!

137
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:51,122
Flight 522!
Nonstop to Tolketna!

138
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,623
That's okay, l'll walk!

139
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,968
MAN OVER RADIO: George Murphy,
you're clear for takeoff,

140
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,966
so quit dawdling and move it!

141
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,007
George Murphy? You're the one
that sent me the summons?

142
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,641
Why, yes. At your service.

143
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,261
But, if you're the executor
of the estate

144
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,724
then why are you, uh?

145
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,307
I'm an attorney,
the justice of the peace

146
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,352
and the bush pilot.
A classic triple threat.

147
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,610
MAN OVER RADIO:
8-6-7—2—4-1-Queen, move it!

148
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,488
Or you're going to be
the hood ornament on a 737!

149
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,720
The captain has turned off
the seat belt sign.

150
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,928
You're free to move about the cabin.

151
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,649
-K|D: Right over here!

152
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,819
All right, all right,
over here!

153
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,113
-Who's that?
-Plane! It's George!

154
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,281
Come on!

155
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,339
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

156
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,383
GEORGE:
Welcome to Tolketna International Airport.

157
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,560
The white zone is
for the loading and unloading

158
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,057
of passengers only.

159
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,815
Careful! Gets a little gusty up here!

160
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,709
TED: Help me!

161
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,564
GEORGE: There it is.

162
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,974
Downtown.

163
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,993
BARB: Hey, you guys,
I know you're starving.

164
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,370
Here's your sandwich.

165
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,747
All right, you roughnecks.

166
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,041
Give me back those knives.

167
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,631
These are for eating.

168
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,047
Nobody's going to order dinner,
if the silverware's been in the walls.

169
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,512
Come on, Barb,
we've all seen your food.

170
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,093
Nobody's going to order it, anyway.

171
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,511
Always a little high.

172
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,189
-MAN: Close the door!
-Whoo!

173
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,568
Whoo!

174
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,065
Hey, slick.

175
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,572
To your health, son.
Enjoy.

176
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,669
He looks just like her.

177
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,733
Ah! Excuse me.

178
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,815
Can I get a cup
of decaf latte, please?

179
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,777
Honey, you can get anything
your little heart desires.

180
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,533
Except a decaf latte.

181
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,986
How about a cup of regular?
Fresh brewed yesterday.

182
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,663
Sure, as long as it's hot.

183
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,411
-Coffee...
-Here you go.

184
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,830
A hot cuppa java.

185
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,464
So, how are you enjoying Tolketna?

186
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,182
Just trying to keep up
with the hustle and bustle.

187
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,980
Hey, Mister. We gotta talk.

188
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,900
I've been waiting a long time
for a dentist to come to town.

189
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,645
Yeah, I got a canker sore
in the back of my mouth.

190
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,190
And isn't that stench unbearable?

191
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,903
All right, quiet!
Now, pipe down!

192
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,700
Time to get started!

193
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,157
We got a will to read here!

194
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,711
George! Knock it off!
| just patched the last hole!

195
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,626
GEORGE: All right.

196
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,466
Now, we're here to read
the last will and testament

197
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,096
of Lucy Watkins.

198
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,640
So, here goes.

199
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,855
Oh. "First off, I'd like
to thank you all for coming.

200
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,182
I hope you got a good turnout.

201
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,815
Though, if there was a blizzard,
I understand.

202
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,396
Now, I don't want any crying.

203
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,572
People should enjoy themselves.

204
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:15,905
So, Barb, why don't you pour
a round of wild turkey on me."

205
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,750
Pass it around.

206
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,249
Here ya go.

207
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,140
What's with sasquatch?

208
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,184
Zip your lip.
That's Thunder Jack.

209
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,986
They call him that
'cause he got hit by thunder.

210
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,237
Twice!

211
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,399
You can't get hit by thunder.

212
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,075
GEORGE: Now, pay attention.

213
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,324
"Now, I led a simple life

214
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,407
so don't expect too many goodies
to be bequeathed.

215
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:06,208
First, to Peter Yellowbear,
my neighbor and fellow snow golfer,

216
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,083
-I leave my lucky putter."
-Yeah!

217
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,671
"But don't expect it
to improve your game."

218
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:21,348
"Next. To Barb,
my dear friend and boss,

219
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,812
I give my shearling coat."

220
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,185
"Which kept me warmer
than any man ever did."

221
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,021
You don't have to talk to it
in the morning.

222
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,863
"And...

223
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,581
to my son, Ted Brooks.

224
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,585
I'm sorry you never knew me...

225
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,548
but to you I leave the rest
of my worldly possessions.

226
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,884
| wish it were more."

227
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,263
Oh! "And to Thunder Jack...

228
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,519
I leave my outhouse
and all its contents."

229
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,413
"Now, in conclusion,
I just want to say thanks

230
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:35,051
to all you misfits, outcasts
and just plain weirdos.

231
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,596
You made living in this icebox fun.

232
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,593
lfl end up in heaven,

233
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,050
I'll put in a good word for ya.

234
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,722
And if! end up down below
well, at least it's warm."

235
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,268
-To Lucy!
-ALL: To Lucy!

236
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,275
-WOMAN: Great gal.
-To Lucy.

237
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,576
It's hard to breathe
at this altitude, huh?

238
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,991
Eh, you'll get used to it
after a week or so.

239
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,619
Oh, no, I'm not planning
on being here that long.

240
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,459
I'm just going to poke around,

241
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,381
get a feel for this Lucy,

242
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,127
maybe inventory her valuables.

243
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,794
Valuables?

244
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,055
You obviously didn't know her.

245
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,927
So, is that all you want?
Is to pawn off all her stuff?

246
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,313
Well, do I owe her more than that?
Huh! She pawned off her kid.

247
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,355
Don't talk about Lucy like that.

248
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,232
You don't know anything about her.

249
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,233
Is that my fault?

250
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,326
Never mind. Forget it.

251
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,208
Wow!

252
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,963
-Come on, I'll show you around.
-Oh, uh, no, thanks.

253
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,303
I think I want to go alone.

254
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,719
-Okay.
-Okay.

255
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,529
One ceramic lamp.

256
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,615
With a tacky shade.

257
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,833
One very dirty throw rug.

258
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,801
Yeah... And...

259
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,240
"Arctic Challenge third place."

260
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,827
Hey!

261
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,623
Where did you come from?

262
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,174
Nobody said anything
about Lucy having a dog.

263
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,722
Of course, no one said anything
about her having a son, either.

264
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,685
Oh, you're hungry, huh?

265
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,271
Well, go tell whoever it is
that feeds you.

266
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,827
Alright. Let's go see if we
can find you some chow.

267
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,038
Nope.

268
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,207
In here?
Where's the dog food?

269
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,677
Not in here.

270
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,257
No dog food.

271
00:21:58,901 --> 00:21:59,856
Oh!

272
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,105
-Oh.

273
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,437
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!

274
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,114
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!

275
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,650
Oh! Oh, oh!

276
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,326
Oh! Get back!

277
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,781
Back! Back! Ha, ha!
Back! Ah!

278
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,290
-Uh-oh.

279
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,915
-Oh, oh!

280
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,751
-Nice doggy.

281
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,583
Nice doggy.

282
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,804
Aah! Trouble. Aah!
Stop it!

283
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,673
-Let go! Let go!

284
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,474
-No, not the jacket!

285
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,010
-No, doggies!

286
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,645
-Hey, I come in peace!

287
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,106
Stop it!
Wait, that tickles.

288
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,991
Oh, no!
Okay, wait! Get off!

289
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,903
-Let me go! Stop that!

290
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,743
Give me the door!

291
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,085
Any more surprises?

292
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,920
-Huh?

293
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,022
Whoa! Whoa!

294
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:51,923
Where's those dogs?

295
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,588
-What?
-The dogs, where are they?

296
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,556
They're eating the house.

297
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,597
TED: Wait! Wait a minute!

298
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,391
Oh, you can't go in there!

299
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,099
This one dog is possessed.
He's dangerous.

300
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,354
Demon.

301
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,852
-TED: Wait!

302
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,064
Mr. Thunder?

303
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,523
Look out.

304
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,402
-Hey, whoa!

305
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,410
How you doing, demon, huh?
How's my boy?

306
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,954
-THUNDER: Oh! Looking good, kid.

307
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,498
How much you want
for these mutts?

308
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,382
Oh, uh. Well, I haven't
Checked the blue book yet.

309
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,762
-|'|| give you $200.

310
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,719
-Each?
-No, for the whole lot.

311
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,179
Well, that seems a little low.

312
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,599
I mean, even the puppies
in the mall cost...

313
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,104
You think I'm trying
to chisel you?

314
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,519
-No.
-You think I'm that kind of a man?

315
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,811
Why don't we just step outside
and settle this thing Eskimo style?

316
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,776
-Hey!
-Just you and me,

317
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,195
a rope and a knife.

318
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,996
And the last man breathing
gets the dogs.

319
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,749
-$200 is great.
-No, it's not.

320
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,999
You just stay out
of this, missy.

321
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,334
-You cheap chiseler.

322
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,750
You and I both know
that any of those dogs

323
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,256
is worth $500 and demon's
probably worth $1,000.

324
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,713
Really?

325
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,715
I'm not going to let you
take advantage of him

326
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,349
just because he's some
dumb city slicker.

327
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,313
You want to sell those dogs,
you look me up.

328
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,869
-Oh, what is this stuff?
-S|ump.

329
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,492
-S|ump?
-Mm-hmm.

330
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,748
Mostly the stuff
the butcher can't sell.

331
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,451
Hooves, lips, organs...

332
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,494
Slump.

333
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,584
In Miami, we call them hot dogs.

334
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,547
Oh!

335
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,440
So, why did Grizzly Adams
want these dogs, anyway?

336
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,104
Because the arctic challenge
is in two weeks.

337
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,948
These dogs are champions.

338
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,151
Except for Nana, of course.
Lucy just liked her company.

339
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,288
Arctic Challenge. What is that?

340
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,375
Well, next to the Iditarod,
it's the biggest dog race around.

341
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,749
Five days across 400 miles

342
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,005
of the most beautiful
and rugged terrain in the world.

343
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,541
Who'd be crazy enough to do that?

344
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,710
Your mother.

345
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,628
Oh.

346
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,398
I'm not being frisky.
I... I'm stuck.

347
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,109
That's what all the guys say.

348
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,291
-Oh!

349
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,249
Happens to everyone.
Up and at 'em.

350
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,834
You're all chapped.

351
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,498
Here.

352
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,428
-So, let me ask you something.
-What?

353
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,635
Did Lucy ever mention
about who my father was?

354
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,851
Sorry.
No one even knew you existed.

355
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,349
-Oh, right.

356
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,935
Well, there can't be
too many suspects.

357
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,018
How many black guys
are there around here?

358
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,944
Including you?

359
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,939
Let me see...

360
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,483
Two.

361
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,790
-Arthur?
-Oh, you must be Ted.

362
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,289
I've been waiting
so long for this.

363
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,005
-Would you like to come in?
-Of course. Thank you.

364
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,172
l was so worried that you wouldn't
have the time

365
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,673
to see me before you left.

366
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,010
l have felt this terrible pain
for so long.

367
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,841
Me, too.

368
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,470
So, should I sit on a Chair
or would you prefer me to lie down?

369
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,146
Uh, Chair's fine.

370
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,859
So, it's my left rear molar.

371
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,823
Filling fell out
a couple of years ago.

372
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:32,454
And now it's purple.
And there's this real rotten odor.

373
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,246
Maybe it's infected.

374
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,709
And you're telling me this because?

375
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,090
Aren't you a dentist?

376
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,918
Aren't you my father?

377
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,964
If I say yes,
do | get a discount?

378
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,314
Doesn't even look like me.

379
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,939
I, uh... categorized
all of Lucy's possessions.

380
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,985
These are the recommended prices.
This is what I'll settle for.

381
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,660
And you can keep ten percent
for yourself.

382
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,450
Oh, what about the dogs?

383
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,495
Give them to Johnny Lightning.

384
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,788
You mean Thunder Jack?

385
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,874
Sure, why not?
He wants them.

386
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,879
I haven't got any use for them.

387
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,169
-Thanks. This'll only take a second.
-Yeah, sure.

388
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,044
You‘re leaving?

389
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,174
I don't know
what I was looking for.

390
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,134
But I sure didn't find it.

391
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,004
Well, what were you expecting?

392
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,889
Maybe a little truth.

393
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,722
Find out about myself,
learn why she gave me up...

394
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,477
Hey, why don't you stick
around for a bit?

395
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,191
The arctic challenge is in two weeks.

396
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,272
There's hundreds of people.
TV crews come around.

397
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,649
-lt's going to be fun.
-Look, I like you.

398
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,281
If you're ever in Miami,
look me up.

399
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,367
My number's on all the buses.

400
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,145
Wait! Stop!
I know who your father is.

401
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,972
TED: Hold it, hold it.

402
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,389
GEORGE: What now?

403
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,185
His name is James Johnson.

404
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:15,950
Whoa-whoa!

405
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,078
Relax, relax.

406
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,501
You can do this.
Good.

407
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,378
Ow!

408
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,214
I hate the snow.

409
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,171
Well, well, lookie here.

410
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,640
Come to sell me them dogs?

411
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,594
You? You're James Johnson?

412
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,055
I don't much like
people calling me James.

413
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,474
What...

414
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,646
You're white.

415
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,610
Will you look at that?

416
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,284
-Do you know who I am?
-Yeah.

417
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,033
You're the fella that's going
to sell me those dogs.

418
00:31:58,542 --> 00:31:59,531
No.

419
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,708
I'm your son.

420
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,585
Well, so, how much
you want for them?

421
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,505
You knew?

422
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,505
You knew the whole time,
and you didn't say anything?

423
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,630
I don't see any good coming
from dredging up ancient history.

424
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,514
Is that what I am?
Ancient history?

425
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,095
| tell you what I'm going to do.

426
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,355
I can go up to 300 dollars
for the lot.

427
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,691
The dogs?

428
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,813
-Don't you think of anything else?
-You got no business with them.

429
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,233
I mean, they're special animals.
They need to be taken care of.

430
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,069
-You're a real piece of work.

431
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,828
You know,
I don't believe we're related.

432
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,071
There must be some mistake

433
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,787
because you are definitely
not my father!

434
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,705
Well, tell you the truth,
I don't much give a hoot

435
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,872
one way or the other.

436
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,133
All I'm saying is that
you don't belong here.

437
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,383
I'm sure you've got a nice,
little condominium someplace

438
00:32:55,557 --> 00:33:00,267
with a remote control color TV
and a nice electric blanket.

439
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,186
So, why don't you pack up
your big City butt

440
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,180
and go back there!

441
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,144
No.

442
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,148
I'm not going anywhere.

443
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:17,034
-You are a stubborn fool.
-No, you're the stubborn fool!

444
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,819
You must have something wrong
with that head.

445
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,830
No, you got something
wrong with your head!

446
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,491
No, you got something wrong
with your head!

447
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,039
No, you got something wrong
in your head!

448
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,465
No, you got something wrong
with your head.

449
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,592
Oh, well,
you know what they say.

450
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,850
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, Jack.

451
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,430
Or should I call you father?

452
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,686
Or how about papa?

453
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,765
Or maybe even daddy-o.

454
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,109
TED: I don't belong here?

455
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,287
I'll show him.
I'll be a mush master.

456
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,326
-A regular sled doggy dog!

457
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,210
-Just watch me, Nana.

458
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,091
-Dr. Brooks speaking.
-AMEL|A: Ted.

459
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,885
I promised myself
I wasn‘t going to bother you

460
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,137
but we thought
you’d be home by now.

461

-|s everything all right?
-Everything's fine.

462
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,807
-So, how's Alaska?

463
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,439
Basically, everything's white.

464
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,607
Including my father!

465
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,979
TED: Ma? Are you still there?

466
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,987
-Are you sure?
-Sure, I'm sure.

467
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:44,113
Well, that explains
why you were always so crazy

468
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,077
about that Michael Bolton.

469
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,460
This has gone on long enough, Teddy.
I am coming up there.

-Rupert, off!
-TED: Rupert, ofﬂ

No, I don't need your help.

Never, ever underestimate

00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,051
DDS!

479
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,109
Bad dog! Bad dog! Get back!

480
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,235
Bad doggy!

481
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,113
Bad dog! Bad doggy!

482
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,756
Whoo!
Who made it in the tree, dog?

483
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,458
Who made it in the tree?

484
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,548
That's right! That's right!
You can't climb!

485
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,262
You don't know
what time it is!

486
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,591
Get over here! How you like that?

487
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,387
Oh, that's cold.

488
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,564
I hope your pee-pee freeze up.

489
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,651
Yeah, that's right, go inside!

490

-TED: This ain't over!

491
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,735
This is only round one!

492
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,363
Ooh! Ooh!

493
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,458
You having fun with that doggy?

494
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,414
You know what
your problem is?

495
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,633
See, Demon's got it in his head
that he‘s the alpha dog.

496
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,677
You've got to show him
who's boss!

497
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,428
Bite him in the ear!

498
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,215
I am not putting any part
of that dog in my mouth.

499
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,143
Suit yourself.
Any musher will tell you the same.

500
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,771
-Oh, you're a musher?
-Are you kidding?

501
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,641
I'm the only man ever
to win the arctic flame

502
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,808
three years running.

503
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,443
Congratulations.

504
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,896
Yeah, well, it is kind of
a strange award.

505
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,939
It goes to the person
who comes in last.

506
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,784
In Miami, three-time losers
go to prison.

507
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,579
BARB: Forget it!
Rest rooms are for customers only!

508
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,294
Out of my way, girlie!

509
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,713
-Hi.
-James Johnson.

510
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,639
Were you being coy, or is that
some sick Alaskan mind game?

511
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,300
-|'m sorry.

512
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,974
I swore to Lucy I wouldn't tell
a soul about Thunder Jack.

513
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,515
| just didn't want
to see you leave like that.

514
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,147
Bring it home!

515
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,158
Whoa, there. Come on, whoa!
Good boy.

516
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,615
Excuse me.

517
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,704
It's time for round two.

518
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,835
All right, Nana, if there's
any trouble, you back me up.

519
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,177
-MAN: Oh, Jack!

520
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,301
I got something for you.

521
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,012
Mr. Thunder?

522
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,432
Look, maybe we started off
on the wrong foot.

523
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,937
Huh.

524
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,645
Listen, I know this
can't be easy for you.

525
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,484
It's not for me.

526
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,613
I had to show up on your doorstep
after so many years

527
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,403
-and I got so many questions and...
-I can go to four.

528
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,158
Excuse me?

529
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,198
I can go to 400,
but that's it.

530
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:01,457
-See, it's mainly Demon that I want.
-This is not about the dogs!

531
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,208
MAN: Look, Jack!

532
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,882
Got in your new shipment
of blue cheese.

533
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,884
Oh! Danish, right?

534
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,294
Oh, yeah.

535
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,096
Nothing crumbles like Danish.

536
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,634
I never seen a man who could eat
as much Cheese as you do.

537
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,557
They ought to call you
Monterrey Jack.

538
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,902
Nobody can eat as much cheese
as I can.

539
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,151
Hey. Hey, no, hey.

540
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,815
-Mm...
-Hey, give me that Cheese.

541
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,241
I'll show you eating cheese!

542
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,736
Give me that Cheese.
Come on, give me that cheese

543
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,995
or somebody's going to get hurt.

544
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,201
All right.

545
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,662
Let's get down to business.

546
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,123
You are not equipped
to keep those dogs.

547
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,091
They're not city dogs.

548
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,337
They're athletes.
They have to run,

549
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,800
they have to get
those hearts pounding

550
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,006
othenNise, they go loco.

551
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,766
Loco?

552
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,772
So...
Show me how to run them.

553
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,807
-Yeah, we could teach each other.

554
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,686
I need to learn to mush,
and you need to learn to floss.

555
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,400
Come on, Jack.

556
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,029
-We need a father-and-son activity.

557
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,111
Father and what?

558
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,656
Sure!
Can't you see the resemblance?

559
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,954
Oh, yeah.

560
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,236
Yoo-hoo... Demon.

561
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,739
Ha... Oh!

562
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,161
You want a piece of me?
Huh? You want some of that?

563
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,833
What? What's my name?

564
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,543
You want a piece of me?
Come get it!

565
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,831
Come get it.

566
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,059
This was not a good idea!

567
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,141
Oh!

568
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,940
Who's the alpha dog now?

569
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,946
-Whoa!

570
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,579
Okay. "Place your feet on runners

571
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,331
keeping your weight centered."
Blah, blah, blah, all right.

572
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,418
Okay, just like a jet-ski with fur.
Hey!

573
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,080
Stop that. Hey!

574
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,171
Hey, knock it off.
Stop it.

575
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,218
Hey, how are you going to pull
if you're this way?

576
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,550
You got to look that...
Come on, buddy.

577
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,886
-BARB: Hey.
-Hi.

578
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,180
I thought we could go
for a picnic up on the mountain.

579
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,934
Sorry. Can't.
I'm mushing today.

580
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,436
See you.

581
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,411
You now, it's not something
you just learn overnight.

582
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,114
Hey, it's in my blood.

583
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,665
First off...

584
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,135
You have to step on the gang line
before you cross over.

585
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,809
-All right.

586
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,265
Okay, this is all wrong.

587
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,564
You have Mack next to Scoop.
That's a definite no-no.

588
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,146
Mack always runs best
when he's next to Diesel.

589
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,610
-Okay.

590
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,608
I know what your problem is.
Can you hold that?

591
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,159
Yeah. Hi, sweetie.

592
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,455
All right, that's good.
And Yodel and Sniff over there

593
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,619
are fine where you got them.
They're your wheel dogs.

594
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,291
They're not exactly
the sharpest tools in the shed

595
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,248
but they'll push or pull
anything you give them.

596
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,005
-Look! Twins. All right.
-Okay.

597
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,760
-What do we do with this guy?
-Girl. This is Duchess.

598
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,674
Scoop over there has got
the biggest crush on her.

599
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,380
The only way
to calm him down is to...

600
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,724
Put him with Duchess!
Good girl.

601
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,392
You two make a lovely couple.

602
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,480
Okay, and that just leaves
my evil half-brother, Demon.

603
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,436
-Oh.

604
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,113
No, he's an incredible animal.

605
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,026
-He was Lucy's pride.
-Yeah, with a lousy personality.

606
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,282
Nice doggy.

607
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,447
-Nice doggy, nice...

608
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,284
Maybe you should try
biting him on the ear.

609
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,337
What is it
with you people?

610
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,344
I'm cool. You cool?

611
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,474
-Sorry, Nana.

612
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,064
but, uh, big doggies only.

613
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:23,028
TED: Okay. Alright. Oh, just got
to program my GPS here.

614
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,573
Oh, well. I got
a great sense of direction.

615
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,120
Okay!

616
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,874
Ready, set, move!

617
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,089
Well, at least I don't have to worry
about you getting lost.

618
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,941
Let's see you try
to throw me this time.

619
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,238
No! No! Oh, stop!

620
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:10,405
Hey, Teddy!

621
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,207
-Want to drag?

622
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,419
TED: Oh! Ooh! Bad dog! Bad dog!

623
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,261
-Fore!

624
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,802
-Huh?

625
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,060
Whoa!

626
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,516
Sorry about that.

627
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,066
You know,
I never would have thought of it.

628
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,398
Thunder Jack. Wow!

629
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,319
Oh, I'm glad everybody's
having a great big laugh.

630
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,575
They are. The way you drive
that sled of yours.

631
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,030
That‘s pretty funny.

632
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,155
Whoa.

633
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,461
Hm.

634
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,328
Mush! Mush!

635
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,115
Nice day for a drive, huh, Nana?

636
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,540
Hi. Eat your heart out.

637
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,923
Oh.

638
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:55,347
Nana,
I finally understand sledding.

639
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,981
Hmm. What got into her?

640
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:14,575
No. Oh, no. No.

641
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:18,367
My eyes! My eyes!

642
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,847
Ah, no. Oh!

643
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,105
Ooh.

644
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,109
Oh, got yourself a skunk, huh?

645
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,728
Good eating.

646
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,911
You know, you're getting to be
an embarrassment to me.

647
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,163
Why didn't you just
tell them to stop?

648
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,949
Don't talk to me like I'm four.

649
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,624
You're not the boss of me.
Of course I shouted, "stop".

650
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,380
They wouldn't stop
if you shout, "stop".

651
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,337
You have to shout,
"break and hook".

652
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,547
Break and hook. Got it.

653
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,587
I want to go, I say mush.

654
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,177
Only in the movies
do they say mush.

655
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,596
Here you say, "hike".

656
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,182
If you want to go to the left,
you shout, “haw".

657
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:24,474
And if you want to go to the right,
you shout, "gee".

658
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,439
Why not just say right and left?

659
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,149
Why do they got to make things
so complicated?

660
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,452
Whew! Man, you really stink.

661
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,993
Whew!

662
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,919
What's that?

663
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,089
Don't worry, mountain man.
It'sjust me.

664
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,053
What are you doing here?

665
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,350
I thought it'd be nice
to walk the hill.

666
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:04,226
And it would be nicer
if you give me a ride back down.

667
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,182
Sure.

668
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,320
This is where l was going
to take you for that picnic.

669
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,858
-How did you know about it?
-I found Lucy's diary.

670
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,991
"It's quiet and perfect.

671
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,080
The one place | feel peaceful...

672
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,080
and can think
about the big questions."

673
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,046
This is the place all the folks
around here come for answers.

674
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:34,419
Oh, nothing but time
and places to think around here.

675
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,639
Great places, sure,
but, uh, no Starbucks.

676
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,683
No indoor plumbing.

677
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:45,013
Oh, yeah? You know what else
they don't have in this town?

678
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:50,151
Crime, traffic,
buses to put your face on.

679
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:59,694
If I could just get that old man
to sit down with me for an hour.

680
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,741
Just to find out
what happened.

681
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,450
It isn't like I want
anything from him.

682
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,414
I don't need a father.

683
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,915
I had a father and he's nothing
like my father was.

684
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,294
My dad was a great person.

685
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,638
Everyone looked up to him.

686
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,763
And your mom?

687
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,473
My mom?

688
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,100
She's amazing.

689
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,983
She does everything for me.
For everybody.

690
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,438
And her sugar cookies.

691
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:33,648
Oh! You haven't lived

692
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,312
till you had one
of my mom's sugar cookies.

693
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,076
Yeah, I miss her.

694
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,742
Maybe the answers for me
aren't even up here at all.

695
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,206
Maybe the answers for me
are hopping on the next plane

696
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,712
back to civilization.

697
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,585
You know, the thing about Lucy,

698
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,087
is she didn't always win the race...

699
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,551
but she never quit.

700
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,642
Maybe you need to finish
what you started, Mountain man.

701
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,003
Oh, that's cool.

702
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:47,602
-That's scary.
-You are such a city boy.

703
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,413
So...

704
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,787
how did you sleep?

705
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,466
-Oh. Oh.

706
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:27,550
That's beautiful. Oh, wow!

707
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:17,813
-Let's go!

708
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,950
Whoo-hoo!

709
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,493
Run, dogs, run!

710
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,925
Woohoo!

711
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,065
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh.

712
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,994
Oh, what are the words?
Duck and cover! Uh!

713
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,530
Cap and gown!

714
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,492
Stop!

715
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:19,828
Stop!

716
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:23,044
Stop!

717
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,177
-Oh!

718
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,003
Blink and hook.

719
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:10,012
Oh, stupid dogs.

720
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,431
I hate dogs. I hate 'em.

721
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,553
-I hate 'em. I hate 'em, I hate 'em.

722
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,226
Oh!
Oh, my goodness gracious!

723
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,402
-Hey, wait, let's all be cool.

724
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,283
Yeah, now, if we all stay calm,
there'll be no problems here today.

725
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,364
You know, I'm a big bear fan.

726
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,499
Sure. Uh, my man,
Smoky the bear. Yogi.

727
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,004
Uh, Walter Payton.

728
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:03,016
I can see the headlines:
"Miami dentist eaten by bear."

729
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:44,853
I'm alive!

730
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,687
-I'm alive!

731
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,691
I'm dead. I'm dead!

732
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,788
Mama!

733
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,417
Oh, help me, Lord!

734
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,520
This is insane!

735
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,624
I'm okay.
Got to get help.

736
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,121
-Got to get help.

737
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,683
Move it, keep moving.

738
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,773
Uh-oh.

739
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,366
Oh. 9-1-1.

740
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,163
OPERATOR: You are outside
your coverage area.

741
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,704
Should you like to expand
your service plan

742
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,873
please call back during
our business hours.

743
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,383
This is a recording.

744
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,063
Cold.

745
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,866
Ted, my main man,
you really stepped in it this time.

746
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,288
We tried to tell you
you didn't belong here.

747
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,040
I don't speak dog.

748
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:55,042
Tell me about it.

749
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,630
I like him.

750
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,213
Oh, sure, you'll roll over for anyone
who'll pour you a bowl of slump.

751
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,589
Hmph.

752
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,638
Scooper, you kill me.

753
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,219
AMELIA: Teddy.

754
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,932
-I made you a special treat.
-Mama?

755
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,022
It's your favorite.

756
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:19,025
Blue cheese cookies.

757
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,609
Ted, remember,

758
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,657
no matter what color you are
you can still have soul.

759
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,368
I mean, look at me.

760
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,080
Can I have one of those
blue cheese cookies, please?

761
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah.

762
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,089
BARB: Hey, city boy.

763
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,333
You've got to learn to relax.

764
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,384
Just sit back and listen
to the sounds of nature.

765
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,923
Relax.

766
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,641
Relax.

767
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:52,016
Relax. Relax.

768
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,936
Relax.

769
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:16,786
Where am I?

770
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:21,125
My, my, my.
Sleeping beauty's finally awake.

771
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,714
-Where are Lucy's dogs?
-They're back home where they belong.

772
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:31,139
I saw them coming
through town without you

773
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,178
so I figured that, uh...

774
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,062
What do you think you were doing
coming all the way out here?

775
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,812
l was mushing.
You should have seen me.

776
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,527
You silly greenhorn.
You could have been killed.

777
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,816
Don‘t you know that?

778
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,780
Well, if you would have told me
what I wanted to know,

779
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,694
I wouldn't be out here
in the first place.

780
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:50,987
Oh.

781
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,997
Ain't nothing to talk about.

782
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,496
-|t's not nothing.
-|t's nothing.

783
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,036
It's not nothing.

784
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,961
-|t's nothing.
-|t's not nothing.

785
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,713
-Ted.
-What?

786
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,590
I'll make you a deal.

787
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,001
| tell you what I know,
I get the dogs?

788
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,089
Yeah.

789
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:14,553
Hmm.

790
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,935
Well...

791
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,772
It all happened
right here in this cave.

792
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,404
It was my second race.

793
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,038
l was out about three days
and this storm blew in.

794
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,246
And I should've, you know,
bunked down...

795
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,161
but I kept going,

796
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,627
thinking I could sneak up
a couple of spots, you know?

797
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,087
That's when it turned ugly.

798
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:49,175
The only thing that saved me
was finding this cave.

799
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,636
And Lucy was already here,
hunkered down with her dogs.

800
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,057
Now, I'd met her
a couple of times in town

801
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,689
but we weren't what you'd call
friends, you know?

802
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:05,438
But cold weather brings
people together in a strange way.

803
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,981
Well, you can guess the rest.

804
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,493
When I woke up in the morning,
Lucy and the dogs were already gone.

805
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:15,205
She finished ninth, that year.

806
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,083
I came in 19th.

807
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,626
After the race, I...

808
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,205
I tried to find her...

809
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,082
but she'd already gone.

810
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,552
That's it?

811
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,588
Afraid so. It's all I know.

812
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,594
Well, a bargain's a bargain.
I guess the dogs are yours.

813
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,022
Oh, well,
I'll take good care of them.

814
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,440
I guess I'd better be
getting on home.

815
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,817
Here you go.

816
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,905
Here, have some soup.

817
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,296
I thought you said this was soup!

818
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,170
Well, there's soup in it.

819
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:28,062
Kid, come on. I want to get airborne
before the winds pick up.

820
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,780
GEORGE: Final boarding call.

821
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,694
Hi, Chester.

822
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,573
Hi, buddy.

823
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:12,795
WOMAN: For the mushers and their dogs
nothing can match this moment.

824
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,756
We're here at the starting
line awaiting the signal

825
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,424
to begin the 112th
Arctic Challenge sled dog races.

826
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,307
And we'll be here bringing you

827
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,312
a bird's eye view of all
the color and excitement.

828
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,930
Back to you, Pete.

829
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,614
My people, I love you.

830
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,248
Will you look at that?

831
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,416
Now, Demon, look at me.

832
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,715
My hands are shot.

833
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,339
This is going to be
my last go around.

834
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,345
And probably yours, too.

835
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,771
So, what do you say,

836
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,274
we just give them something
to remember us by, huh?

837
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:19,361
Ah, that's my boy.

838
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,496
ANNOUNCER: There he goes
the Michael Jordan of dog sledding,

839
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:27,077
Olivier Trajean.

840
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:28,954
AMELIA: Teddy?

841
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,171
Oh, my Lord,
it's freezing in here!

842
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,721
You see that dog out front?
That‘s the lead dog.

843
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,933
Those two in back,
they're the wheel dogs

844
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,719
but it's the lead dog that
drives the team.

845
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,479
ANNOUNCER: He's ﬁnished dead last
three years in a row

846
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,685
and he believes...

847
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,651
-Why am | a dentist?
-You always wanted to be a dentist.

848
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,613
Except for that one year
you wanted to be

849
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,115
the Six Million Dollar Man.

850
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:05,912
You were always running
in slow motion.

851
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:10,371
We had to take ten extra
minutes just to get anywhere.

852
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,369
Oh, Teddy.

853
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,421
IS this Tolketna?

854
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,087
-Who's this?
-Oh, that's Barb.

855
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,137
She's just a friend.

856
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,257
Mm-hmm.

857
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,981
So this is...

858
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,786
She's pretty.

859
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,994
She looks just like you.

860
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:57,380
Oh, Teddy, I'm so sorry.

861
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,880
-|'|| get it cleaned up right now.
-Don't bother, I'll get a broom.

862
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,174
So, is this the father?

863
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:09,725
Who?

864
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,761
This white man with her and the baby.

865
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,852
Oh, look how cute you are, Teddy.

866
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,730
He lied to me.

867
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:26,405
Hello? Yes, I need your next flight
to Alaska.

868
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,874
REPORTER: A test of speed
and agility today,

869
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,246
at the Arctic challenge.

870
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,498
Here at the ﬁnish line,
the weather is ﬁne

871
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:39,130
but out on the course,
a massive Arctic storm

872
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,499
is blowing in tonight.

873
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,510
The lead teams are bunking
at the rusty knife checkpoint

874
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,887
hoping that morning
will bring relief.

875
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:03,571
Hey, girl. Good girl.

876
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:07,317
-How they look?
-Feet look good.

877
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:11,279
-Oh!

878
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,994
Old Demon never changes,
huh, Jack?

879
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:17,251
Been kind of ornery
ever since Victoria passed.

880
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:29,639
What kind of a man eats
before he feeds his dogs?

881
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,676
Don't worry, they already docked him
20 minutes for that one.

882
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,771
Uh, Jack, there's a storm
brewing out there.

883
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,727
Everybody's bunking in.

884
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,939
Come on.
I saved you a spot by the heater.

885
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,403
Yeah, thanks, Ernie.

886
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,366
-JACK: Hey!

887
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,319
Come on, Demon! Pick it up.

888
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:53,495
-Pick it up.

889
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,411
Pick it up, Demon.

890
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,163
-Whoa.
-Hey, hold up, there.

891
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,578
The old fool.

892
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:11,681
MAN OVER PA: Flight 1128 arriving
from Seattle and Miami at Gate B.

893
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,181
Hi.

894
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,021
George.

895
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,100
All right, let's go.
I got to find Jack.

896
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,360
Ted, there's something
you need to know.

897
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,646
Later. He lied to me.
Come on.

898
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,780
-Ted? Wait.
-What?

899
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,570
Jack's missing.

900
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,323
-What?
-GEORGE: He made the check-in

901
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,831
at Rusty Knife. Then the old fool headed
straight into a storm.

902
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,662
That's the last
anybody saw of him.

903
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,170
And the weather's gotten so bad
the rescue crews had to turn back.

904
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,545
I know where he is.

905
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,377
You think you know
where he is.

906
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,883
He could be anywhere
within a hundred square miles.

907
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,014
Come on.

908
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,810
BARB: You can't do this.

909
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,643
When I was lost,
he came looking for me.

910
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,479
I'm not going to let
him die out there.

911
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,361
-Ted, you don't even have a lead dog.
-Sure, I do.

912
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,612
There's my lead dog.
Hi, Nana.

913
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,326
-BARB: Nana?

914
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,494
-Nana's not a lead dog.
-Sure, she is.

915
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,876
If I can be a musher,
she can be a lead dog.

916
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,378
Atta girl, Nana.

917
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:33,763
Whoo!

918
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,346
Ted, please be careful.

919
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,024
-Ready up!

920
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:52,361
-Mush! Mush!

921
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,775
Get up there! Ha!

922
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,285
Ha! Mush!

923
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,280
Hey! Hey!

924
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:09,040
And it looks like our winner
is going to be, once again...

925
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,510
Hey!
Isn't that guy going the wrong way?

926
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,296
MAN: Hey, check out Ted.

927
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,262
-Go! Yeah, go!

928
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,511
Get up there!

929
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,305
-Olivier!
-Did you see him?

930
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,273
Whoo-hoo!

931
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,394
Whoo-hoo!
No more slump, boys!

932
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:33,323
It's milk bone for everyone!
Woo-hoo!

933
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,455
Olivier, you've won
the Arctic challenge.

934
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:45,205
-What are you going to do next?
-I'm going to Disneyland, Paris.

935
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,341
-O|ivier!
-Look what you've done.

936
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,921
We must run away.

937
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,973
I am so sorry

938
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,310
but all I've got is
American money.

939
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,149
Paging Dr. Te... Whoa!

940
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,079
-Here, let me help you.

941
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,713
Oh, thank you.

942
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:37,010
-You must be Ted's mother.
-Well, you must be Barb.

943
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,968
So, what did he tell you about me?

944
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:43,259
-He says you make amazing cookies.
-Oh!

945
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,478
Oh, that isjust like Ted.

946
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,478
He wouldn't say a bad thing
about anyone.

947
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,022
-Where is he?

948
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,983
That's it! That's it! Come on, guys.
Come on, come on.

949
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,868
Right, right, left, left,
right! Come on, come on!

950
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,204
Come on! Come on!

951
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:15,253
-Okay, okay.

952
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,047
Two-minute break.
Two-minute break.

953
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,464
Scooper,
what have you got now?

954
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,091
Sure, you can dig,
but you can't pull?

955
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:50,289
But wait a minute. Just wait.

956
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,713
Now, this is my son.
Aren't you supposed to send

957
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,500
a search party or a posse
or something?

958
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,339
Look, ma'am.

959
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,846
We're sorry, but there's simply
no way to go through the pass.

960
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,349
And it's too windy
to send up a chopper.

961
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,143
-|'m sorry.

962
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,267
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

963
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,482
-Did you say your son is out there?
-Mm-hmm.

964
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,277
REPORTER: To the men and women
of the Arctic Challenge,

965
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,909
the Arctic flame is a symbol of hope.

966
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,163
It can't be extinguished
until the last musher has found

967
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:30,325
his way out of the wilderness
and crossed the finish line.

968
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:34,670
This year, that flame flickers
for one man lost out on the trail

969
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,923
old-time sledding legend,
Thunder Jack Johnson.

970
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,967
But we've now learned
of a startling unofﬁcial

971
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,049
rescue effort that's unden/I/ay.

972
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,839
- Ted Brooks.
-Yeah!

973
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,929
Get this!
A dentist from Miami, Florida

974
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:52,684
is bravely facing the storm
with his own team of dogs.

975
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:53,810
You go, Ted.

976
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,476
REPORTER: Tonight, somewhere
in the darkness,

977
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,817
a story as old
as time itself unfolds

978
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:04,150
as man and animal work together,
braving the elements

979
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,741
in what has become not a race
of winners and losers

980
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:11,783
but simply a race for survival.

981
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,464
Whoa, whoa, brake it off.

982
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:44,857
Jack?

983
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,072
-Jack?

984
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,250
Easy, Demon, easy.

985
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,379
Jack?

986
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:11,555
Okay. Good job, boys.
Okay, good, good boy. Good dog.

987
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,643
All right, good boy.
Good job.

988
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,222
Oh, Jack. Jack.

989
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,061
Jack.

990
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:24,855
Okay.

991
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,134
What are you doing here?

992
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:49,968
Your leg's broke.
I'm splinting it.

993
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,595
Yeah. Well, how'd you get here?

994
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:54,560
Same way you did.

995
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,432
-Not bad for a greenhorn. huh?

996
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,063
Not bad at all.

997
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,608
So, what kind of crazy stunt
were you trying to pull out there?

998
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:14,239
Oh, I thought I could win
if I rode off into that storm.

999
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,581
But if I'd bunked in
like I should've,

1000
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,367
I wouldn't have run into that tree,
and...

1001
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,541
What...

1002
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:25,503
-Ah-ah-ah!

1003
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,799
It's the latest
in personal Climate control.

1004
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,428
I guess I ought to thank you
for coming after me.

1005
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,429
Because you didn't...

1006
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,103
You didn't have to, you know.

1007
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,763
It's payback.

1008
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:41,891
Now we're even.

1009
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,862
No, we're not even.

1010
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,161
You know, I've always believed

1011
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:58,074
that a man who don't tell it
like it is, is a liar.

1012
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,743
And I hate liars.

1013
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,543
Well, I lied to you, son.

1014
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,503
l was at that hospital.

1015
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,059
The night you were born...

1016
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,023
Well, you were no bigger
than a loaf of bread.

1017
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,977
I walked into that room,
and the doctorjust

1018
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:28,817
placed you right in my hands,
just like that.

1019
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:35,494
And in all my life,
I'd never seen anything like it.

1020
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,159
But me and Lucy knew that we,

1021
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,328
we had no business
trying to raise you.

1022
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,588
You know, we were no good
for each other and we...

1023
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:49,216
We race dogs.

1024
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,797
But, uh, kids...

1025
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,137
But Lucy...

1026
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,633
wanted to bring you into this world.

1027
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,938
But she knew that it would be better
if somebody else raised you.

1028
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,017
So, now, you can't blame
everything on Lucy.

1029
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,609
l was nowhere near ready
to be a father.

1030
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,406
See...

1031
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,577
we were independent spirits,
Lucy and me.

1032
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:22,162
Oh, we'd see each other
from time to time and,

1033
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:23,916
you know...

1034
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:27,542
But I did love her.

1035
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:32,672
Oh... Oh, I loved that woman.

1036
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,386
I miss her.

1037
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,477
Did she love you?

1038
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,652
Well, she said so once.

1039
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,440
And then she poked me
right in the face.

1040
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,864
Yeah, but you turned out okay.
Look...

1041
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,079
I bet Lucy would be proud of you.

1042
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,005
I know I am.

1043
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:24,849
Mrs. Brooks...

1044
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:27,689
why don't you come inside?

1045
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,185
They'll sound off the siren
when one of them comes in.

1046
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,854
I'm not going to leave him.

1047
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:35,864
I can't.

1048
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,074
TED: All right, guys, let's go.

1049
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:46,617
-Come on, let's go.

1050
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,288
Okay, Demon,
let's get that harness on.

1051
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,550
Oh, that dog's
not going anywhere.

1052
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:57,719
Well, what's wrong with him?

1053
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,552
He's, uh, gnawing at his harness,
won't eat.

1054
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:04,017
He's just one unhappy dog.

1055
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,224
Gnawing at his harness, huh?

1056
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,013
Yeah.

1057
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,651
All right, Demon, let's take
a look at your Chompers.

1058
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:16,521
Oh!

1059
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,657
-Okay, Demon.

1060
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,451
-You leave me no choice.

1061
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,572
Good, good boy.

1062
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,123
Come.

1063
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:40,804
I can't believe you actually
bit that dog on the ear.

1064
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,594
But that's what everyone says
you're supposed to do.

1065
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,766
Well, sure, but...

1066
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:49,183
I never met a man dumb enough
to do it.

1067
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:52,853
Okay.

1068
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:55,815
Okay. All right.

1069
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:59,531
Good boy. Open wide.
There we go.

1070
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,942
Let's see what you got there.

1071
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,910
-Here's the problem.

1072
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,530
Oh, okay, all right.
All right, Demon.

1073
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,249
Trust me,
I'm not going to hurt you.

1074
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,002
Okay?

1075
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,219
My, my, my.

1076
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,760
Well, if you want to bite me now,
go ahead.

1077
01:24:36,822 --> 01:24:37,857
Mush!

1078
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,386
There's a medic down
at Caribou Falls.

1079
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:12,228
What do you want to do?

1080
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:15,440
l have never not finished a race.

1081
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,109
Well, I'm not going
to let you start now.

1082
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,395
Hah!

1083
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,827
Go ahead, Demon!

1084
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:30,390
-Teddy, I'm slipping out. Whoa!
-Hang on, Jack! Hang on.

1085
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:09,717
-Oh. Oh, yeah.

1086
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:23,019
-Demon, get it, baby!
-Way to go, Demon!

1087
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,732
Barb, l have a confession to make.

1088
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,953
Are you Barb?

1089
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,371
I never told Ted he was adopted.

1090
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,211
I know.

1091
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,135
There were so many times
when I could have told him.

1092
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,171
It would have been
the right thing to do.

1093
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,594
I know that now.

1094
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,512
But from the first moment
I held him in my arms...

1095
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,979
I couldn't have loved him more.

1096
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,724
But I was afraid.

1097
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,902
l was afraid if I told him the truth,

1098
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:10,028
he wouldn't love us.
Not in the same way.

1099
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:16,197
AMELIA: Barb, tell me he's going
to cross that finish line.

1100
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,164
He's going to cross
the finish line.

1101
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:24,413
Amelia, he's going to cross
the finish line.

1102
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:27,378
Oh, I know, dear.
It's just a mother's worry.

1103
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:30,134
-I keep thinking...
-|t's the siren. He's coming in.

1104
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:47,694
That's it!

1105
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,193
-MAN: Let's go!
-What's going on?

1106
01:29:01,461 --> 01:29:02,541
Oh...

1107
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,391
Yeah!

1108
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,686
-Oh, Barb!

1109
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,778
Oh. Oh, wait!

1110
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:41,748
Get me a close-up.

1111
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,833
Oh, wow!

1112
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,208
Let me help you, Jack.

1113
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:51,671
Not bad for a dentist
from Miami, huh?

1114
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,176
Not bad.

1115
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:55,549
Not bad at all.

1116
01:29:57,475 --> 01:29:59,215
Ted! Ted!

1117
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,552
Let me through, please.
Ted!

1118
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,815
You're here.
You came all the way here to Alaska.

1119
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:12,237
I got on a plane and 14 hours
of prayer later, here I am.

1120
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:19,744
Come here.
There's someone I want you to meet.

1121
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,789
Jack... This...

1122
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,533
This here's my mama.

1123
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,750
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

1124
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,586
JACK: Well, it, uh...

1125
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:35,218
It certainly is a pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

1126
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,965
You and your husband...

1127
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,389
certainly did a fine job
with this guy.

1128
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:48,640
Oh, Barb.

1129
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,365
TED: He's an amazing guy.
He really is.

1130
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,235
I'm so happy for you.

1131
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,697
Barb, I...

1132
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:09,745
Dr. Brooks,
the honor is yours.

1133
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,756
Jack, I believe you earned this.

1134
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:18,511
Oh, no, no, no.

1135
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:21,845
I think we both should
blow it out together.

1136
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:05,151
Okay, Ernie.

1137
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,533
Dr. Brooks is ready
to see you now.

1138
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:08,947
I haven't finished

1139
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,116
reading about the crown
and the bridge yet.

1140
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,123
-Come on.
-Oh, well...

1141
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:22,965
Oh, here they are.

1142
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,926
Avalanche. Little Aleutia.

1143
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:30,970
And there's Chinook.
And my favorite, Demon Junior.

1144
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,436
Good to see you, Ernie.

1145
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,698
-Doctor, is this going to hurt?
-Oh, just a little.

1146
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,235
More than a tickle
and less than paying your taxes.

1147
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,416
Okay, open wide.
