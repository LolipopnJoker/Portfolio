Good morning, daddy.

00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:31,258
Hey, hey. Ben,
how you doing, man?

31
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:33,587
Oh!

32
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:35,791
Oh, God.

33
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,756
Oh! Daddy's got
to get ready for work.

34
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,625
Can't you stay home?

35
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,803
No. I got a big day
at work today. Real big day.

36
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,100
Kim.

37
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,398
Where's my cell phone?

38
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:51,866
It's with my crayons.

39
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,574
It's not supposed
to be with the crayons.

40
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,109
There you go, sweetie.

41
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,083
OK, now, where's my beeper?
Has anybody seen my beeper?

42
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,152
Oh, here it is.

43
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:17,516
Right by the grape juice.
I wonder how it got there.

44
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:21,256
Are those my note cards that
I've been working all night on?

45
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:24,703
I've been up all night and now
they're... now they're all sticky.

46
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,459
Sorry, baby.

47
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,866
Yeah.

48
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,197
Yeah..

49
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,671
Yeah, I'll see you later.

50
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:35,301
Oh, oh, don't forget
about the orientation today.

51
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:36,466
The what?

52
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:38,873
Chapman academy?
The preschool?

53
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,665
Oh, OK.
Yeah, yeah, right. OK.

54
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:43,206
Is there any way
we could reschedule that?

55
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,338
Oh, you know, maybe we
shouldn't reschedule that.

56
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:49,576
Maybe we should take care of
business and be responsible parents.

57
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,782
Don't worry.

58
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:51,816
Don't be late.

59
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,947
I will not be late.

60
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,221
Promise?

61
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:56,578
I won't be late.

62
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,020
OK, see you later.

63
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,289
Hey, did he promise?

64
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,760
He sure did.

65
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:07,386
Hey, what's going on?

66
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,891
Your worst nightmare.

67
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:10,996
What?

68
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:13,297
Mr. broccoli's a no-show.

69
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,169
He got a call-back
on a potato chip commercial.

70
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,098
These snack foods
are killin' us!

71
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,937
Yeah, I know.

72
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:21,268
Marvin!

73
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:22,272
Yeah?

74
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:23,706
Marvin.

75
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:25,267
The guy who smells the mail?

76
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:29,043
Look, we need a guy to wear a
broccoli suit, not a normal person.

77
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,775
Marvin, my man!

78
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,780
My friend, Marvin. Hey, man, what's goin'
on today? Listen, I need a little favor.

79
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:35,617
We're having a little
focus group in here,

80
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,818
and the guy who's supposed
to wear broccoli suit, left.

81
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,120
I was wondering if you'd put
the suit on and cover for us?

82
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,222
No.

83
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:46,061
Oh, I can't do the broccoli
because it's just not me. Sorry.

84
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:50,294
Hey, can I be the carrot,
though?

85
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,126
Yeah, yeah,
you could be the carrot.

86
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:53,661
Let him try
no. R carrot on.

87
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:54,925
Yeah, you can be the broccoli.

88
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,562
No, I don't want to be a bush.

89
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:59,896
It's not a bush, it's a stalk of broccoli.
It's a strong stalk of broccoli.

90
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:01,432
Yeah, I'm pretty strong.

91
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,966
Yeah, you can make that work.

92
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,400
Go in here and go and switch this
suit on, and get the broccoli.

93
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,565
Trust me on this.

Zowie! Do we have a special

106

"Hey! We have
a brand-new cereal!

107

You're the first kid..."

Help!

109
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:50,772
Ugh!

110
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:53,407
It's super yummy.
And loaded...

111
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:54,708
Phil, help me, ahhh!

112
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,439
With all sorts of stuff
that's good for you.

113
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,305

00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:02,081
Veggie-o's!

00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,917
This cereal sucks!

116
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,419
They're turning on us.

117
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,090
Give it a chance. Let it get in
their mouth. They got to taste it.

118
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,420
No, no.

119
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,964
Take that!

120
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,827
Help me, Charlie!

121
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:22,828
Not in the face!
Save yourself, carrot!

122
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:25,501
Call security now. Oh, sh...
hey, oh, hey, stop that!

123
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:31,136
I guess we better go in, pooch.

124
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,706
Your daddy will come
a little later.

125
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:35,237
Come here, let me see you.

126
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:43,380
Hey!

127
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:45,781
I am so sorry, baby.
I am sorry.

128
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:48,953
Things got crazy at work.
Hey, what's going on, man?

129
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,490
Look at this place. This is
Princeton for preschoolers.

130
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:54,047
Let's just hurry up, so we won't
be late for the orientation.

131
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,616
Hey, what's the
orientation about?

132
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,594
It's a preschool, they're gonna
be playing with blocks, right?

133
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:58,922
Yeah.

134
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:08,732
Unbelievable.

135
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,371
Language skills are a critical
component here at Chapman.

136
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:14,499
They're part
of our core curriculum.

137
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:15,871
You must be Charles.

138
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:17,872
Oh, please call me Charlie.
Nice to meet you.

139
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:18,874
How do you do?

140
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,035
Hi! She's my wife, Kim.

141
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:23,042
Kimberly. I'm miss harridan,
the headmistress.

142
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:24,705
And this is Ben.

143
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:27,281
Well, how do you do, Benjamin?

144
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,751
Oh, come on, little man.

145
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,620
It's a pleasure to meet you.

146
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,975
Shall we begin?

147
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,686
Look at their little outfits.
I like that.

148
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,647
They're cute.

149
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,386
We find uniforms reinforce
the sense of structure.

150
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,692
Oh, yes, structure's good.

151
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:46,363
Our philosophy is that a child
is like a climbing vine.

152
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:50,133
With structure to cling to, and
the right gardener to tend them,

153
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,502
they'll grow to the sky.

154
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:54,770
Sorry.

155
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:56,538
So, Mrs. Hinton,

156
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,039
you're returning to work?

157
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,241
Lawyer,
I believe your file said.

158
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:04,183
Uh, yeah, actually,
I haven't practiced yet.

159
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,309
We just had Ben
when I finished law school.

160
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:09,615
Still a little nervous
about leaving him.

161
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:13,086
Oh, all mothers are.
But you needn't worry.

162
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,047
Our little seedlings
are in very good hands.

163
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:18,387
Turn the darn phone off.

164
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:19,561
It's off, it's off.

165
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,418
And attack!

166
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:23,286
Now mark your books, number 5.

167
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,529
Cat is to mouse as frog is to...

168
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,797
Are they doing S.A.T. Prep?

169
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:31,428
It's never too early to start.

170
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:32,403
Nest.

171
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:34,000
That's right. Nest.

172
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,403
I thought you turned
your cell phone off.

173
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:41,004
It's not my cell phone,
it's my 2-way.

174
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,871
Oh, no. This is bad.

175
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,907
Go ahead.

176
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,441
OK. Thank you, baby.

177
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,005
Um,

178
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,953
I am terribly sorry. I have an emergency
at work, and I gotta get going.

179
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:55,149
I understand.

180
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,350
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:57,781
Hey, little man.

182
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,815
Daddy's got to get going, but
I'm gonna see you later on, OK?

183
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,190
You want to do the rocket ship?

184
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,889
Yeah, come,
let's do the rocket ship.

185
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,067
Sorry about all the noise.

186
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,928
Here you go.
Go to mommy.

187
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:22,636
I'll see you later.
Thank you for your time.

188
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,509
I'm so sorry. He's trying
out a new product at work.

189
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,338
Hmm, well, no need to apologize.

190
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,878
Diligence always sets
a fine example.

191
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,949
Oh, Jenny.
Just in time.

192
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,807
Here's a copy of our curriculum

193
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:38,675
and a list of your
financial obligations.

194
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,420
This is the price per year?

195
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:42,818
Per month.

196
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,688
You know, Ben is starting
preschool today.

197
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:48,719
Oh, yeah, where at?

198
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,292
Over at that Chapman academy.

199
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:52,021
Ah, the marine corps
of day care.

200
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,826
Max goes there.

201
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,127
Really? What do you
think of that place?

202
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,299
It's not like you got much choice. You
got harridan and her merry fembots,

203
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,458
you got idiot Von idiot
and their school for children

204
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,026
who like accidents.

205
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:06,204
Fellows, fellows, numbers just came
in for chocolatey chocolate balls.

206
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,636
Through the roof!

207
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:10,397
That's a big surprise. You hear that, Phil?
Kids like chocolate.

208
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,636
Ice cream, too.

209
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,810
OK, sorry, I forgot I was
talking to the granola-heads

210
00:10:13,811 --> 00:10:15,208
from the natural food division.

211
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:17,679
Now, what was the stinker
you guys got saddled with?

212
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,378
It's not a stinker. It's called veggie-o's,
and it's the cereal of the future.

213
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,081
Right, veggie-blows. I thought
they were killing that.

214
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,746
Jerry! Yo, Jerry!

215
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,881
Catch the numbers on the
chocolatey chocolate balls?

216
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,186
Through the roof, baby!

217
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:31,947
What does he mean,
"killing that"?

218
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,455
Why you listening to Bruce?
Nothing's being killed.

219
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,717
You know this guy's a clown.

220
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,264
If something was going down,
we would know about it.

221
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:39,789
We're killin' it.

222
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:43,393
Hey, come on, Jim. We had one bad test.
And it's a hard nut to crack.

223
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:46,496
Any fool can sell
chocolatey chocolate balls

224
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:49,469
and cotton candy-flavored
cereal to kids, man.

225
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,536
Cotton candy.
That's... that's not bad.

226
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:55,937
Hey, guys, look.
I'm sorry, but it was a dog.

227
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,470
Kids just don't want to eat
vegetables for breakfast. Who knew?

228
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:03,076
It's exactly what I told you 6 months
ago when you put us on this project.

229
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,046
You did?

230
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,547
Well, it's not
just veggie-o's.

231
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,319
We... we're shutting down
the whole health division.

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,648
That's like 300 people.

233
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,792
Yes, it's just not a business
we want to be in.

234
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:16,247
So, where are we
being reassigned?

235
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:23,459
So, pooch, how was your
first day at school?

236
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,385
OK.

237
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,163
Just OK?

238
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:29,398
I don't know anybody there.

239
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,499
Oh, well, give it some time.
You'll make some friends.

240
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,173
How about you, baby?
How was your day?

241
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:37,471
I lost my j-o-b.

242
00:11:37,473 --> 00:11:39,540
You lost your j-o-b?

243
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,808
I got f-I-r-e-d.

244
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,378
Me and 300 other people.

245
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,607
They cannot do that!

246
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,580
What about Jim fields?
Can't he do somethin'?

247
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,648
Jim fields is the one
that pulled the trigger.

248
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,747
Now he's not gonna be
inclined to do anything,

249
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:53,579
'cause when I found out it was him,
I told him to take a flying f...

250
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:54,875
Charlie!

251
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
H-I-j-k-l-m-n-o-p.

252
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,689
Don't worry about this.

253
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,190
I'm a guy in demand, and I'll
have a new job in a week.

254
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,362
A week.

255
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,864
Hey, what if we use
the emergency fund?

256
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,827
We can't. We already used
it on the car payment.

257
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:19,896
OK.

258
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,265
There's no way around it.

259
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:27,011
We gotta pull Ben out of Chapman,
it's just too much money. Look.

260
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,239
Then what are we gonna
do for child-care?

261
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:30,744
Are you gonna
stay home with him?

262
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:33,675
No, I'm not gonna
stay home with him.

263
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:37,219
Look, we just gotta find something
more affordable, that's all.

264
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,777
This is the right address.

265
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,275
You gotta be kidding me.

266
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,246
Hey, we can at least
check it out, you know.

267
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,787
Ben is not goin' here.

268
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,848
Looks can be deceiving.
Let me just go take a look.

269
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:49,016
Looks can be deceiving?
We're in a trailer park!

270
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,015
Yes?

271
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,326
I might have made a mistake,
I'm looking for the preschool.

272
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:55,088
Oh-ho, yes, it is.

273
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,660
Welcome to the...

274
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,366
Sorry.

275
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,997
Welcome to
the touch of Eden preschool.

276
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,032
Can I help you?

277
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh, uh, no, thank you.

278
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,809
Is this the right address, here?

279
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,707
I think so.

280
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,938
Hi!

281
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,042
Hello.

282
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:21,213
We keep the children
right around here.

283
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:30,022
Go ahead.
After you, ma'am.

284
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:34,806
OK.

285
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:35,857
Where'd you get
this address of this place?

286
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,389
No, you picked this place.

287
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:38,933
We should report
this to somebody.

288
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,757
All right,
that's what I'm talking about.

289
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,426
See, I knew there had to be at
least one decent place in town.

290
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,225
Yeah. It looks all right.

291
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:54,539
<i>This is the police.
We have you surrounded.</i>

292
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Oh shit! Go!

293
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:04,412
All right, Charlie.
Give up the keys.

294
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,945
I don't know where the keys are.

295
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,379
D-don't even try it.

296
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,023
I don't know where
the keys to the Benz are.

297
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:10,417
Why don't you drive the minivan?

298
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,578
No. We already talked
about this last night.

299
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:16,616
You're staying home with Ben.
I'm driving the Mercedes.

300
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:20,992
You're gonna have me driving around
town in the dumb minivan all day.

301
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,960
Is the top down?

302
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,901
Hey, you know what, Kim?

303
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,431
Just be careful.
Don't just park it anyplace.

304
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,571
And... and be careful getting
in and out of the car.

305
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:32,468
Don't get any dings
in the door, you know.

306
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:33,699
And make sure...
come here.

307
00:14:33,703 --> 00:14:35,641
Make sure you put
the good gas in there.

308
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,238
'Cause if you put in
the cheap stuff,

309
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,939
it's gonna make the engine start
knocking, and I don't want that.

310
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:43,079
And you don't leave milk inside the
car with the windows rolled up.

311
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,607
Always buckle up the car seat.

312
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:47,011
Don't park in the sun
or the seats will get too hot.

313
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,713
Oh, and no juice unless
it's in a sippy cup.

314
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,605
Bye, baby.

315
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,676
Hey, can you give a call, let us
know what time you'll be back?

316
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,819
Because we'll be here waiting,
just the two of us.

317
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:01,921
Bye, mommy.

318
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:03,524
Not too fast!

319
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,759
See you later.

320
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:10,796
When's mommy coming back?

321
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:13,557
She'll be back
around dinnertime, mommy.

322
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:17,332
Is dinnertime soon?

323
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,703
No, but don't you worry. We're
going to have a lot of fun.

324
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,744
But we need mommy to have fun.

325
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,008
Wow.

326
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:31,039
What are you trying, just break
me down in the driveway?

327
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,244
Why you want to break
your father down like that?

328
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,276
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,710
That's better.

330
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:37,714
'Cause you broke me down smooth just now.
My eyes welled up...

331
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:38,716
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,147
OK, you made my eyes
OK. I up.

333
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:41,251
Look at my eyes.

334
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:42,922
I see your eye twitching.

335
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,950
We're going to have fun!

336
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:03,104
Yes!

337
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:05,035
Do you know
how to change a diaper?

338
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,740
Yeah, but... wait, I thought
Max was potty-trained.

339
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,039
Believe me, so did I.

340
00:16:10,043 --> 00:16:12,312
<i>Don't do that to me!
What are you...</i>

341
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,541
He's throwing things at me,
and it smells.

342
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:16,576
<i>I really need your help!</i>

343
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:20,675
Are you potty-trained?

344
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:21,823
Yes.

345
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:25,482
You got to go stinky?

346
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,586
Yes.

347
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:28,787
Then, go on.
Go stinky, then.

348
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,689
You have a nauseous ache
in the pit of your stomach

349
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,064
that you're a worthless failure?

350
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:41,797
We are worthless failures.

351
00:16:41,798 --> 00:16:42,958
Hey, guys.

352
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,095
Hey, Peggy.
Good. You doing?

353
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,330
What's going on, Nicky?

354
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,869
Yeah, he can be a little hard
to understand sometimes.

355
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,072
Yeah honey, go play.
Have a good time, have fun.

356
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:57,412
And listen, stay away
from that cat poop, OK?

357
00:16:57,413 --> 00:16:59,139
<i>Hija?</i> What is that?
What'd he just say?

358
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,744
Oh, my God, I haven't a clue.

359
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:03,605
The doctor says it's just a phase
he's going through, but...

360
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,714
Well, it kept him
out of Chapman.

361
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,116
Jerks.

362
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:10,747
Max! Max!
Put that mouse down!

363
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,718
Give it to me!

364
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,022
Oh, what are you...

365
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:21,758
You know something, Charlie, I think it's
great, you guys being full-time dads.

366
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,061
Yeah. Yeah,
we're real giants among men.

367
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:26,263
Seriously. You are. You
should be proud of yourself.

368
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,625
Most guys I know, don't even
know who their kids are.

369
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,434
So Joe still hasn't
found anything?

370
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,695
No, and he's driving me crazy.

371
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,403
I should go back to work, but
what am I going to do with Nicky?

372
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,895
Dead mouse.
Dead mouse.

373
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:39,666
There's no good alternative
to that Chapman joint.

374
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:42,165
Dead mouse, dead mouse,
dead mouse.

375
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:54,851
I tell you somethin',
if someone opened

376
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:57,352
a decent day care program around
here, they'd make a killing.

377
00:17:57,354 --> 00:18:00,154
Nicky, what did I say
about the cat poop?

378
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:26,535
What?

379
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,206
A day care center?
You and me?

380
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:30,752
Yes, Phil, this is a
completely under-served market.

381
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:32,849
Harridan has a monopoly
on this whole suburb.

382
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:34,681
All we have to do
is just come in,

383
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:37,686
and establish ourselves as the value
alternative, and we'll clean up!

384
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,689
You think I'd be good
at taking care of kids?

385
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,857
Absolutely.

386
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,188
Excuse me?
Are these your kids?

387
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:45,694
No.

388
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,860
Remember when
you broke my yo-yo?

389
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,195
I did not break your yo-yo.

390
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,459
Yes, you did.

391
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,166
I did not break your yo-yo.
Your yo-yo was broke.

392
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,698
You're killin' me.
You're really killin' me.

393
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,879
Hey! I'm home!

394
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:11,676
Ooh!

395
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:20,453
You said let's do this together.

396
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,154
No, daddy!

397
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,585
And now you're saying
what's going on here?

398
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:32,161
A day care center.
In our house?

399
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:33,932
Yes, Phil's apartment's
too small.

400
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,431
It's only a 2-bedroom place.

401
00:19:35,432 --> 00:19:38,002
Charlie, this is crazy
on like 10 different levels.

402
00:19:38,003 --> 00:19:40,170
What do you and Phil know
about running a day care?

403
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,299
This is not rocket science. We
applied for a license the other day.

404
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:44,695
It couldn't be any more simple.

405
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:45,906
Daddy.

406
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:47,737
OK, what you want?
The rocket ship?

407
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,305
OK, that's what
you wanted, right?

408
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:53,379
Milk.

409
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,080
Oh, you wanted milk?
I'm sorry. He wanted milk.

410
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,452
Yeah, 'cause rocket man needs
milk when he's flying around.

411
00:19:58,453 --> 00:20:00,781
It's for strong bones,
in case you crash, right?

412
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:04,146
We understand each other.
What you think about this?

413
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,816
I think we're talking about
other people's children, here.

414
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:08,885
Do you know what type of
responsibility that is?

415
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:11,033
I'll be just as careful
with them as I am with Ben.

416
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,125
Oh, hey, man, don't be running
your head into stuff.

417
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,360
Watch where you're walking.
What's the matter with you?

418
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,095
What are you gonna do
when you get a real job?

419
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,030
You're just gonna leave
the parents hanging?

420
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,665
Hey, we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

421
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,570
Look, this is not gonna be permanent.
All right.

422
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:28,772
We're not gonna get rich from this, but
it might keep us out of bankruptcy.

423
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:30,135
I don't know, Charlie.

424
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:31,643
Come on, look, Kim.

425
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,144
I can't just sit around here all day.
I got to try to do somethin'.

426
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:36,046
Come on. I need this.

427
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:41,346
I guess you better start
handing out those fliers.

428
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:42,852
All right.

429
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,053
Me, too. Much more sense...

430
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:48,155
OK, you want me
to give you a hug?

431
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:50,058
Here's a big hug. Group hug.

457
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,819
Hmm.

458
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:18,464
You know, the "experienced" part
is what I have to take issue with.

459
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:25,857
I give it 3 days.

460
00:22:25,865 --> 00:22:29,495
So, you 2 guys are running
a day care center?

461
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:32,671
You're signing up people at a
lemonade stand on the front lawn?

462
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:36,906
Wow, that's... Good luck with that.
Come on, Paul.

463
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:40,807
Hey! Hey, wait a minute. Don't you
believe in equality amongst the sexes?

464
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,880
Can't men do everything
women can do?

465
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:46,078
No, no, we can't.
It's unnatural.

466
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,445
A little bit eeky.

467
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,650
You're guys?

468
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:52,820
What did you think
daddy day care meant?

469
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,319
I thought maybe one guy.
Not nothing but guys.

470
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,890
I just thought
it was a clever name.

471
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:58,089
Is this the day care place?

472
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,890
They're guys.
They're all guys.

473
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:01,121
They're what?

474
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:05,155
Excuse me. Listen. We are
2 loving, caring parents,

475
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,762
and we run a day care center.

476
00:23:06,763 --> 00:23:08,701
A couple of sickos
is what you are!

477
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:11,528
Don't be... hey, miss, hey, how
about a free trial offer?

478
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:12,800
Sickos!

479
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,425
Uh-oh. Dear, dear.

480
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,536
Come on!

481
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:20,001
Hi, Peggy! Hi, Nicky.
How you doin'?

482
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,736
Hi! Nicky is so excited
for his big day.

483
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:24,612
Nicky, how old are you, hon'?
Oh, yeah, 5.

484
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,840
OK, I got it.

485
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:28,744
Wait. You're gonna leave Nicky
here with these guys?

486
00:23:28,746 --> 00:23:31,076
Yeah. Oh, come on, you have
trouble with them being guys?

487
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,481
What are you,
from the dark ages?

488
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:35,082
Aren't you for all that gender
equality and all that jazz?

489
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:37,652
Peggy, come on.
Of course we are.

490
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:40,453
OK. So can't women do what men
do and men do what women do?

491
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:42,185
These guys can do the job.

492
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,057
What, are you gonna
vouch for these 2?

493
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:46,118
Yeah, I'll vouch for 'em.
I'll vouch for these guys.

494
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:47,256
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,690
OK, OK, OK. Just...
I'll try it.

496
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:49,831
You're gonna do it?

497
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,358
They'll have a great time.

498
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:52,892
Right, kids?

499
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:54,896
You're a real lifesaver.

500
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:59,228
You know what, you screw this up, I'm
gonna kill you with my bare hands.

501
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:00,965
Here, now, go to Phil.

502
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,770
No, I don't wanna go.

503
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:03,840
Come on.
Let go.

504
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:04,898
I don't wanna go!

505
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:07,265
He's got a little bit
of separation anxiety.

506
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,835
Oh, Dylan!

507
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:11,176
Don't want...

508
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:14,338
I just stopped breastfeeding.

509
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,876
I'd freak out, too.

510
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,180
If you could just grab a leg.

511
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,247
I don't wanna go.

512
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,248
All right.

513
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,449
Here we go.
Come on.

514
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,150
Come on, Dylan.

515
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:23,781
I don't wanna go, E.

516
00:24:23,785 --> 00:24:25,545
OK. OK.

517
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:26,553
Ow! Let...

518
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:29,188
come on. Let go of mom!

519
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:30,219
I don't wanna go.

520
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:31,489
Let go, wow.

521
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,657
Thank you. Oh, man.

522
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:35,658
No lactose, no peanuts,
no shellfish.

523
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,627
Nothing high in fructose.

524
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:39,158
Or sucrose or dextrose.

525
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:41,362
Or maltodextrose.

526
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:43,832
Nothing with red dye number 6.

527
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:44,833
Or number 4.

528
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,769
Or yellow dye number 2.

529
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,870
Will you say "maltodextrose"
for me again? So cute.

530
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:52,573
Maltodextrose.

531
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,074
Ma-maltodextrose.

532
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,905
Or yellow dye number 2.

533
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,176
2, right.

534
00:24:58,177 --> 00:24:59,677
His name's Crispin.

535
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:03,046
My man, Crispin!
How's it goin' there, big guy?

536
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,417
What time's pickup?

537
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:10,248
At 5:00 P.M.

538
00:25:10,253 --> 00:25:12,791
Hmm, I have laser treatment.
Make it 6:00.

539
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,358
Sorry about the outfit.
He won't take it off.

540
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,917
How long has he been
wearin' that?

541
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:19,085
Couple of weeks.

542
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:21,993
Now who are you gonna call if
there are any problems, sweetie?

543
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:23,555
911, mommy.

544
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,063
That's such a good girl.

545
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:29,765
Come on. Come on. Come on, Dylan!
I'll let you hold my keys.

546
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:32,198
How about life savers?
You like life savers?

547
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:34,573
How about money?
A dollar?

548
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:36,602
Ah!

549
00:25:37,673 --> 00:25:39,273
Yeah! A dollar.

550
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:40,374
Hmm.

551
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,575
You are a smart man.
That is yours. All right.

552
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,008
Welcome to daddy day care.

553
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,951
We're your team facilitators. My
name is Charlie and this is Phil.

554
00:25:50,952 --> 00:25:53,719
OK, anybody ever seen
a mission statement before?

555
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,386
Here. Everybody take one.
Take a mission statement.

556
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:58,387
Me!

557
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,218
Here we go. One for everybody.
Slow down.

558
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:01,489
All right. OK.

559
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,759
Now, who wants to be first one
to read the first sentence

560
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,260
on the mission statement?

561
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:10,058
OK, how 'bout you?

562
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:12,396
I don't read yet.

563
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:14,227
OK, I'm looking
for someone who can read.

564
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:18,232
OK, now, by a show of hands, how
many of you guys can already read?

565
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:23,499
OK, uh, raise your hand
if you don't know how to read.

566
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:27,267
OK. Here's what
we're gonna do.

567
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:29,535
I'm gonna read
the mission statement aloud,

568
00:26:29,543 --> 00:26:32,113
and what I want you guys to do
is just follow along

569
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,612
as I read
the mission statement. OK?

570
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:37,584
Doesn't that sound like fun,
interesting fun? Here we go.

571
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:41,952
"As the members and facilitators
of the daddy day care team,

572
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:44,921
we will collectively
strive to provide..."

573
00:26:44,922 --> 00:26:49,291
OK, Sean, don't... don't eat the... the mission
statement. Get that out of your mouth.

574
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,392
"Will collectively
strive to..."

575
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:53,964
And don't you rip the mission
statement, little flash.

576
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:56,433
Because it's a very important
document... hey!

577
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:59,202
N-now, come here.
Hey! Come back here!

578
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:03,868
OK. Uh, so, what he's
really trying to say is...

579
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:14,083
Stop runnin'! Stop runnin'!

580
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:15,938
Come here! Come here!

581
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,476
Hey, come back here!
One second.

582
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,049
OK, up? You want
the rocket ship?

583
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,416
One more?

584
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:24,577
Rocket ship! Rocket ship!

585
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:26,015
Everybody'll get
the rocket ship.

586
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,119
Slow down, slow down, everybody.
Slow down!

587
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:31,560
I thought you said
this was gonna be easy.

588
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:33,257
You know what I'm thinking now?

589
00:27:33,258 --> 00:27:34,618
That it was a huge mistake?

590
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,856
Yeah, you know, Phil,

591
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,660
I never quit anything in life,

592
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:41,062
but I'm not sure how much
longer I can take this.

593
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:42,330
I'll be right back.

594
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,561
Hey, where you goin', man?

595
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:44,555
Trust me!

596
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:45,866
Help me do the rocket ship.

597
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,367
Rocket ship!

598
00:27:52,372 --> 00:27:55,772
4 absent children.
No explanation.

599
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,735
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

600
00:27:57,743 --> 00:28:02,212
In a group this size, 3 absent
children is a coincidence.

601
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,653
4 is a statistical anomaly.

602
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:09,775
Hello, Santa Luma!

603
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,520
Hey, everybody! It's big
Phil with a guitar!

604
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:18,623
OK, why don't you guys enjoy big
Phil while I rest my spine?

605
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,826
Max, bring your dad a chair.

606
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:24,896

That's too loud.

692
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,237
C'mon, man, let go,
it's too loud.

693
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,842
I'm serious.
Let go, crispin. Crisp...

694
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,781
All right, then.

695
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,509
Gettin' kinda late. Where do
you suppose your mommy is?

696
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:33,914
Shut up, butthead.

697
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:36,375
Shut... hey, you stop that!
Hey, you know somethin'?

698
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:40,453
Your mommy and daddy would not like you talkin'
like that. You should not talk like that.

699
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:42,554
When your mommy comes,
I'm gonna tell her that you...

700
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:44,256
I'm delayed, let's go.
Motor's running.

701
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:45,557
Yeah, c'mon, get out of here.

702
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:46,658
Stop!

703
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:47,819
I wish you would.

704
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:49,126
Crispin, don't make that face.

705
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:50,427
What?

706
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,996
Don't make lines.
Quiet the face.

707
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:55,757
Relax the face.
Quiet the face. Quiet.

708
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,996
Yes, c-calm your face.
Show no lines, you know.

709
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,566
You got early drop-off?

710
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,837
No, we don't have anything...

711
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,238
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

712
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,010
I'll see you tomorrow, crispin.

713
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,738
Tomorrow.

714
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:12,343
All right, you're gonna be just
like your father. Look at him.

715
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:15,005
Hanging off of him,
his skin. Hanging off.

716
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,610
Hey, little man.

717
00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:18,880
Hey, dad.

718
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,151
What are you up to?

719
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:25,146
Hmm, just tryin' to read
a story.

720
00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:28,516
Hey, listen, man,

721
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:32,221
I know I was really busy today with those
other kids, taking care of them and all.

722
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:35,693
I know it probably wasn't easy for
you, havin' to share all your toys

723
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:39,332
and watchin' daddy do rocket ship
with everybody, but, you know,

724
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:42,160
now it's just me and you, we
can do whatever you wanna do.

725
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,226
Can we read this story?

726
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:46,268
We sure can read this story.

727
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:47,569
All right.

728
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,670
"There once was
a herd of elephants.

729
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:52,873
"Elephants young, elephants ol',

730
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,975
"elephants tall and short,
fat and thin.

731
00:33:56,144 --> 00:33:58,113
"All were different,
but all were happy,

732
00:33:58,114 --> 00:34:00,381
"and almost all
were the same color.

733
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:02,780
And they all made
the elephant sound."

734
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:03,882
They all said...

735
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:07,345
Let me hear you make that sound.

736
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:10,588
All right.

737
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:12,056
Do it again?

738
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:15,527
Oh, no, I can't do it again, because
daddy might have an aneurysm.

739
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,433
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

740
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:32,766
I'm not cleanin' this up.

741
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,845
Ah!

742
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,358
Hey, take this in there.
Go sit down.

743
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,459
All right, maybe I haven't
had my coffee yet,

744
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:00,032
but it seems like these kids are
multiplying. What's going on?

745
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,201
Yeah, we got 2 new kids.

746
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:02,298
Oh, come on!

747
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:04,268
Listen, we're gonna have to
up our game today.

748
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,327
We need structure
and some planned activities.

749
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:08,735
No, we need Ritalin and
leashes, that's what we need.

750
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:10,967
Hmm.
All we're gonna need is this.

751
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:14,874
All right, everybody,
let's do this.

752
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,765
Everybody, come in here.
OK, here we go.

753
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:19,506
OK, all right, c'mon, let's try
another play. Let's try this.

754
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,612
Let's try this. Here's what
we're gonna do now.

755
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:24,114
Here's a new play, all right.
It's called the baby blitz.

756
00:35:24,116 --> 00:35:26,476
Nicky, I want you to hang back.
We're gonna do a lateral.

757
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:29,215
I want you to go down the
middle for a button-hook, OK?

758
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:31,091
Here, you,
I want you to be my blocker.

759
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,919
How about we just
run in a circle?

760
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:37,755
OK, we can do that. That's an even better
play. Everybody just run in a circle.

761
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:41,862
Yes? All right, let's run in a circle.
Come on, run in a circle.

762
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,996
Tony, you'll see the ball a lot
better if you take your mask off.

763
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:47,202
I'm not Tony, I'm flash.

764
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,274
Hmm.

765
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:57,111
Hey!

766
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,146
How come you're not playing,
little man?

767
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:04,582
Come on, it's football.
You love football!

768
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:05,775
Help!

769
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:08,353
Help! Stuck!

770
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,559
I live in California.
Where do you live?

771
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,060
<i>I am in Hong Kong.</i>

772
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:18,891
Where's Hong Kong?

773
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:22,997
Can you hear me now?

774
00:36:22,998 --> 00:36:24,298
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

775
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:25,359
Can you hear me now?

776
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:26,426
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

777
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,733
Can you hear me now?
What is it?

778
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,866
I thought you liked football,
all this time.

779
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,801
You're gonna tell me
you don't like...

780
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,411
I'll be... I'm gonna be right back,
little man. I got to go...

781
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:44,484
Hey!

782
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:46,878
Hey. Phil.

783
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:50,082
Hey, uh, you got a little
problem over there with Max.

784
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,145
Oh, it's happening.

785
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:53,490
What's happening?
What is it?

786
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:57,417
It! It's happening. He hasn't
gone for a week. That's it.

787
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,423
Oh, no. That's... that's...
It's happenin'?

788
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,926
It's happenin'.
I know the face. Look.

789
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,934
That's your cue. You gotta
go and deal with that.

790
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:08,962
I can't.

791
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:10,666
What do you mean,
I can't.T?

792
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:11,767
You have to do it.

793
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:12,898
I can't.

794
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:13,932
Yes, you can.

795
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:14,936
I can't.

796
00:37:14,937 --> 00:37:16,337
All right, I will!

797
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:17,438
Good. Come on.

798
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:31,506
Oh, oh, oh!

799
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,987
I can't.

800
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:42,858
OK, listen. I can see you
got issues about this,

801
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,957
so I'm gonna take care
of it this time, all right?

802
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,219
Yeah.

803
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:48,186
But in the future, you gotta
work this one out yourself.

804
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:49,460
I gotta work it out.

805
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:51,631
That's your son. And God
willing, when you get older,

806
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:55,129
he's gonna do this for you one day, so
you wanna know that he owes that to you.

807
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:56,197
He owes me.

808
00:37:56,198 --> 00:37:57,358
Yeah. Es you.

809
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,497
Hey, don't get cute
with the thing.

810
00:38:01,502 --> 00:38:03,471
I'm not assuming
you're doin' it.

811
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:05,300
All right,
so how you wanna do this?

812
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:07,095
I can do this myself.

813
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:08,636
Yes. Sure?

814
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,079
OK, well, you go and do it with your
bad self. You go and do it now.

815
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,777
All right. You need anything,
I'm right out here, OK?

816
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:30,987
Hey! Hey, big guy,
how'd it go in there?

817
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,289
I missed.

818
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,560
What does that mean?

819
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,787
I missed.

820
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:37,362
Oh, hell, no.

821
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:07,817
Whew!

822
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:13,485
Hey!

823
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:15,158
Come on!

824
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:17,489
No, no, no!

825
00:39:17,494 --> 00:39:20,604
Come on. You put this down.
You don't play with this.

826
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,997
You ripped up my wife's flowers.

827
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,729
You give me this. You're not supposed to.
Go play with something else.

828
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:27,925
Hey, what's goin' on here?

829
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:29,466
We're spiraling out of control.

830
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,440
Look, don't panic, because they're
like animals. They can smell fear.

831
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:34,609
I don't know what else to do.
I've run out of ideas.

832
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,207
I'll tell you what...

833
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,268
Hey! Hey! Hey!

834
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,438
Quietly, children. Follow me.

835
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,509
6 absences.

836
00:39:47,214 --> 00:39:49,348
Single file.

837
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,579
I have to go make a phone call.

838
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:58,288
Let's get ready to rumble!

839
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:03,191
Let me tell you something, brother.
I have never liked carrots.

840
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,993
And today as I stand here
and look at you before me,

841
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:09,395
having the audacity to think
that you can defeat me,

842
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:11,028
let me tell you something,
brother,

843
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:13,867
I am about to kick
your carrot butt!

844
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:16,298
Let me tell you something,
Mr. broccoli.

845
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:18,472
When the carrot
is done with you,

846
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:20,740
you will be nothing
but a kumquat!

847
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:24,208
I will destroy everything in
this world that is broccoli.

848
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:26,679
The carrot is the lowest
form of vegetable!

849
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,208
Hey. Hey! What about me?

850
00:40:29,213 --> 00:40:30,583
Nobody likes broccoli.

851
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:34,281
Really? Well, Ben likes
broccoli, don't you, Ben?

852
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:36,551
No.

853
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:40,587
You turned my own sprout against me?
Now you're gonna die!

854
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:01,298
OK, come on.
I felt that.

855
00:41:01,304 --> 00:41:04,572
Hey, hey, hey,
hey. Hey! OK!

856
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:05,613
Come on!

857
00:41:06,274 --> 00:41:07,841
Will you stop it?

858
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,543
Ahhh! That's it.

859
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,813
Ah! Hey, hey, hey!
What's that about?

860
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:18,945
I'm sorry.
You made me crazy!

861
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,780
You little maniac, you! Wreckin'
my wife's tables and stuff.

862
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,050
Somebody's at the door.
Ah! My back.

863
00:41:28,924 --> 00:41:30,057
Hey, hi.

864
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:36,128
Is this the, uh,
the Hinton residence?

865
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:38,296
I'm Dan Kubitz, child services.

866
00:41:38,297 --> 00:41:41,497
I'm here to, uh, conduct
a compliance inspection.

867
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,800
Inspection? No one said
anything about any inspection.

868
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,971
Well, we only do it if we
receive a complaint.

869
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:48,300
A complaint?
Somebody complained about...

870
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,405
Well, come on in. You can inspect us.
We got nothing to hide.

871
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:54,539
Um, you caught us at a crazy time.
We're playing with the kids.

872
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,805
Somebody... somebody complained
about us?

873
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:01,245
So, wh-where is the nap area?

874
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:04,017
Right. P area?

875
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,918
Uh, we don't really
have a nap area.

876
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:08,949
We just let them fall asleep
wherever they drop.

877
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:12,855
OK, "sleep where they drop." Well, you know,
I think that should just about do it.

878
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:14,758
Um, what's the bottom line?

879
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:19,259
Well, you need to correct
the deficiencies on this form.

880
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,363
OK.

881
00:42:20,364 --> 00:42:21,764
And also,

882
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:25,865
you need to fill out these
compliance certification documents.

883
00:42:25,868 --> 00:42:27,998
Who wants these,
the carrot or the broccoli?

884
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,903
Carrot.

885
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:32,204
There's a lot of stuff on here.

886
00:42:32,206 --> 00:42:33,666
So we can stay open, right?

887
00:42:33,674 --> 00:42:36,314
As long you have that done by 9 A.M.
tomorrow morning.

888
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:38,276
9 A.M.? 9 A.M.

889
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:41,107
Hey good luck with this. I... I like
what you guys are doing here.

890
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:43,283
I... I don't wanna be the guy
that has to shut you down.

891
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:45,281
Yeah, we'd hate for you
to be that guy.

892
00:42:45,283 --> 00:42:47,053
I will be. Don't wanna be.

893
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:51,345
OK. Safety gates
at the bottom of the stairs,

894
00:42:51,354 --> 00:42:54,356
top of the stairs,
bedrooms, bathrooms.

895
00:42:54,357 --> 00:42:56,717
I've gone safety gate crazy.

896
00:42:56,726 --> 00:42:59,086
Hey, how many kids
have we taken care of?

897
00:42:59,095 --> 00:43:01,425
I've lost track,
they run so fast.

898
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,260
Well, you can get started on
this little batch over here.

899
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:07,026
Ah, you know, it's getting kinda late.
Let's just call it a night.

900
00:43:07,035 --> 00:43:10,595
No, we cannot call it a night. We got a
bunch of kids showin' up here in 5 hours.

901
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,705
I'm serious. We don't know anything
about running a day care center.

902
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:16,208
We don't know anything.
We're not even good parents!

903
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,440
I'm a good parent.

904
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:21,046
What? Does that mean?

905
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:23,447
That thing.
What is that?

906
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:26,019
Uh, you know that rocket
ship thing you do?

907
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,318
Ben doesn't even like that.

908
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:29,389
First of all, you don't know
what you're talkin' about,

909
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,487
'cause that happens to be
Ben's favorite thing.

910
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,259
Well, I've seen it, OK? He only
lets you do it because you like it,

911
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,218
it's the only time
you pay attention to him.

912
00:43:36,226 --> 00:43:37,986
You don't even change
your kid's diapers.

913
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:39,527
I don't like diapers.

914
00:43:39,528 --> 00:43:42,028
Well, you should teach your kid how
to go to the toilet and aim, too,

915
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,500
so every time he goes we don't
have to redecorate the place.

916
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:45,759
You're right.
You're right.

917
00:43:45,766 --> 00:43:47,326
Let me tell you somethin'.

918
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,404
My kid is 4 years old, and for the
first time today, I saw him playin',

919
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:53,071
havin' a good time with the other
kids, just being a normal kid.

920
00:43:53,072 --> 00:43:55,272
I made me feel great, that I
had somethin' to do with that.

921
00:43:55,274 --> 00:43:56,374
We did that!

922
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,375
If we can do that,
we can definitely

923
00:43:58,377 --> 00:44:00,037
get this place up
to code by dawn.

924
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:03,881
Let's go safety gate crazy.

925
00:44:03,882 --> 00:44:05,916
Don't worry,
he's gonna be fine, OK?

926
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:06,917
It's all right.

927
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:13,152
All I got is $5.

928
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:14,556
I can break that.

929
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:19,026
Hey. Hey, listen. I left the
paperwork on the kitchen table.

930
00:44:19,027 --> 00:44:21,457
It's not there.
Please tell me you have it.

931
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:22,892
I don't have it.

932
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,266
Hey, guys.

933
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,870
Marvin, what are you doing?

934
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:38,571
The, uh, door was unlocked. I
got your final paychecks here.

935
00:44:38,574 --> 00:44:39,614
Thanks.

936
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,665
So, what's going on here?

937
00:44:44,344 --> 00:44:46,344
Well, we...
don't even ask.

938
00:44:46,346 --> 00:44:47,406
Hey.

939
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:54,783
<i>Hija.</i>

940
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:02,851
You can understand him?

941
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:04,816
Yeah. Yeah,
he's speaking Klingon.

942
00:45:04,824 --> 00:45:07,362
Oh, that's Klingon. I thought
the kid was an idiot.

943
00:45:07,363 --> 00:45:10,289
God, how much <i>Star Trek</i>
does that kid watch?

944
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:13,559
Charlie, the guy from
child services is here.

945
00:45:13,564 --> 00:45:14,564
Oh, man.

946
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:15,625
Sorry.

947
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,501
No, no, listen.
Why don't you do me a favor?

948
00:45:17,502 --> 00:45:20,568
Why don't you take the kids in the
back and play with them for a while?

949
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:22,969
Keep their attention for a
while, while I talk to this guy.

950
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,771
Whatever you do, don't let this big
bruiser get near the lawnmower.

951
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:27,540
Thanks, Marvin.

952
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:28,641
Hey,

953
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,908
Mr. Kubitz. Hi.

954
00:45:29,909 --> 00:45:31,378
I thought I was early, but...

955
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,507
I was just getting
all the paperwork.

956
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:34,842
Great. Great.

957
00:45:35,413 --> 00:45:36,683
You dropped something.

958
00:45:36,684 --> 00:45:37,810
Yeah.

959
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:40,678
The kids wanted to help out.

960
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:41,952
Oh! Oh, that's sweet.

961
00:45:41,953 --> 00:45:44,549
Yeah. So here's everything
for you.

962
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:48,787
What I'll need is your signature
on the back of her head.

963
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,088
And on the elbow of this kid.

964
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,590
Oh, do you have a pen?

965
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:54,158
I do have a pen.

966
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,759
This is my lucky pen.

967
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,490
Ah, thank you.

968
00:45:57,495 --> 00:45:59,055
And where's on the...

969
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:00,797
initial... initial
the elbow.

970
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:01,798
OK.

971
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:03,029
Sign the back of her head.

972
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,666
Yeah. R neck? OK.

973
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,167
Great. That should
just about do it.

974
00:46:06,168 --> 00:46:07,528
Here we go.
OK.

975
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:09,236
You're ready to roll.

976
00:46:09,237 --> 00:46:12,137
Let's go in and get started.

977
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:15,508
Well, you know,
everything looks OK here,

978
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,579
but it says here
that you now have 11 children.

979
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,838
That's correct.

980
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:21,005
Yeah, yeah.

981
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:24,547
So I assume that you've hired
a 3rd care provider.

982
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,578
Why would you just assume that?

983
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:31,083
Well, section 768 of the child
welfare code specifically states

984
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:35,146
that the ratio of children to
care providers cannot exceed 5:1.

985
00:46:35,155 --> 00:46:36,145
The 768.04.

986
00:46:36,156 --> 00:46:37,156
768.04.

987
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:38,417
The ratio.

988
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:40,324
The ratio thingy. We
resolved that this morning.

989
00:46:40,325 --> 00:46:41,615
We resolved that this morning.

990
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:42,726
Good. Good.

991
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:44,487
We hired someone.Eone.

992
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:46,355
Marvin, Marvin..

993
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:47,396
Yeah.

994
00:46:47,397 --> 00:46:50,057
Marvin has been hired!

995
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:52,426
He's an excellent
right outside with the kids.

996
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,365
Well, I'd love to take a look,
if that's OK with you.

997
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:57,338
Oh, you want to go out there?

998
00:46:57,339 --> 00:46:59,769
I think it's probably a good
idea for me to see for myself.

999
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:01,574
Let's go and have
a look at Marvin.

1000
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:09,977
Now, put your hands up!
Now, wave 'em!

1001
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:16,054
You know, h-he certainly seems like...
like he knows what he's doing.

1002
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:17,322
Oh, yeah, of course.

1003
00:47:17,323 --> 00:47:18,620
I've got to say that.

1004
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:21,051
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had to
interview a lot of people.

1005
00:47:21,056 --> 00:47:24,716
Yeah, it was a really long, grueling,
singling-out process for...

1006
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:32,129
And now, I'm a chicken.

1007
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:35,766
I'm a bird.
Look, I'm a bird.

1008
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:39,197
You can never be too careful when
it comes to kids. You can't.

1009
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,703
And here at daddy day care we
only want to work with the best.

1010
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:44,365
So, we got the top of the
notch and that's Marvin.

1011
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:47,968
Sorry.

1012
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:50,006
Shh. Sorry.

1013
00:47:50,011 --> 00:47:51,641
What did you do to these kids?

1014
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:52,675
What?

1015
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:54,109
Are they on drugs?

1016
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:56,282
Oh, there's this one,
one kid, maybe.

1017
00:47:56,283 --> 00:47:58,511
How'd you get them
to behave like this?

1018
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,076
Just got to know
how to handle them.

1019
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,824
How do you know
how to handle them?

1020
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:05,488
I read <i>Dr. Spock's baby</i>
<i>and child care</i> book.

1021
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:08,119
It's not about <i>Star Trek.</i>

1022
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:09,124
Huh?

1023
00:48:09,892 --> 00:48:11,592
I'm gonna finish.

1024
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:12,693
Yeah. Yeah

1025
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,800
You know,
when... when I was in the back,

1026
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:22,268
I spotted, under... under the
eaves of the, um, of the porch

1027
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:25,699
what looked like a beehive.
A really big beehive.

1028
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:27,035
Don't worry.
All taken care of.

1029
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,609
I don't want
anybody getting hurt.

1030
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,107
No hurt. Gone.

1031
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,538
Guys, you should be proud. You really
have turned this thing around.

1032
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:33,680
Thank you very much.

1033
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:34,907
I'm impressed.
I really am.

1034
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,181
Thank you very much.
And for our own curiosity,

1035
00:48:37,182 --> 00:48:38,949
this little complaint
that you guys got...

1036
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,108
any chance you could tell
us where it came from?

1037
00:48:41,116 --> 00:48:42,646
I'd love to.
I really would love to.

1038
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,450
But that... that... because... I have
a relationship with the state.

1039
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,082
Just for our own curiosity.

1040
00:48:47,086 --> 00:48:48,986
Oh, that was miss harridan.

1041
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:50,547
I'm sure she'll see us.

1042
00:48:50,555 --> 00:48:52,085
We need to talk to you.

1043
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:54,219
Sorry, miss harridan,
they just barged right in.

1044
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,224
That's quite all right, Jenny.

1045
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,286
Gentlemen, please sit down.

1046
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:04,732
Now, what can I do for you?

1047
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,971
We wanted to come down
and personally thank you

1048
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:09,168
for helping to expedite
our accreditation process.

1049
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:12,440
Thanks to your anonymous tips, somebody
from child services came to see us.

1050
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:15,409
I had heard you'd opened
some sort of day care program,

1051
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,176
and, uh, well, I was concerned.

1052
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:21,077
That's very nice of you. But you
don't have to be concerned about us.

1053
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:23,048
Oh, it's not you
I'm concerned about.

1054
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:25,007
It's the children
you're looking after.

1055
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:27,645
Hey, wait a minute. We're parents,
all right. That's a start.

1056
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,250
Any boob can be a parent.

1057
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:32,021
If you want to screw up your
own child, that's your right.

1058
00:49:32,022 --> 00:49:34,150
But when it comes
to other people's children,

1059
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:36,215
there's a higher standard
to answer to.

1060
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,123
Oh, well, Mr. Kubitz seems to
think that we met that standard.

1061
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,515
Show her the thing.

1062
00:49:40,526 --> 00:49:42,986
That piece of paper
doesn't impress me.

1063
00:49:42,995 --> 00:49:45,955
Uh, we're getting it laminated.

1064
00:49:45,964 --> 00:49:50,000
You 2 are just some fly-by-night
operation looking to make a fast buck.

1065
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:52,071
You're just afraid of the competition.
That's all.

1066
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,538
Come on, let's get out of here.

1067
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:55,937
Competition?
Don't flatter yourselves.

1068
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:59,909
Daddy day care will never be in the
same league as this institution.

1069
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,210
Laminated!

1070
00:50:03,211 --> 00:50:06,580
For some reason, that just wasn't as
satisfying as I thought it was gonna be.

1071
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:08,081
You know,
I think we can take her.

1072
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:10,182
All we need is a clove of
garlic and a wooden stake.

1073
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:12,754
Hey, hey, hey, you know what she
said that was right just now?

1074
00:50:12,755 --> 00:50:14,522
These kids need
more than just watching.

1075
00:50:14,523 --> 00:50:16,121
Tomorrow we gotta
take it up a notch.

1076
00:50:16,122 --> 00:50:18,792
We got to start stimulating
their minds a little bit.

1077
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,690
But I'm not a daddy.

1078
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:24,331
You don't have to be a daddy.

1079
00:50:24,332 --> 00:50:27,528
You're a male-type humanoid. That fits
in with the philosophy of the place.

1080
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:31,031
I don't know, guys. I mean, I guess
I... I like hanging out with the kids.

1081
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:32,367
It's kind of cool.

1082
00:50:32,368 --> 00:50:36,637
But, uh, I guess child-care
wasn't necessarily an Avenue

1083
00:50:36,638 --> 00:50:38,938
that I felt professionally
I was headed towards.

1084
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,209
That's exactly what I said.

1085
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,241
Excuse me.
Yes, come on in!

1086
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:46,106
Oh, hey, how are you?

1087
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,410
Hey, guys.

1088
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,511
I am so sorry. I forgot to
write you a check this week.

1089
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,784
Ever since the divorce,
my head's just been like...

1090
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,076
<i>♪ Ooh, dream Weaver ♪</i>

1091
00:50:56,084 --> 00:50:57,052
hi.

1092
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,051
Oh, hi.

1093
00:50:58,052 --> 00:50:59,052
Hi.

1094
00:50:59,053 --> 00:51:00,223
Are you the new daddy?

1095
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,590
I'm your daddy.

1096
00:51:04,756 --> 00:51:06,286
I'm not your daddy.

1097
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:08,287
But I'm your baby's daddy.

1098
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,291
I'm not...

1099
00:51:10,426 --> 00:51:13,956
I'm not your baby's daddy.
I'm going to be...

1100
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:16,085
I'm... I'm...

1101
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:18,233
You're Marvin.

1102
00:51:20,198 --> 00:51:21,628
Marvin.

1103
00:51:21,632 --> 00:51:25,602
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Marvin. I'm Kelli.

1104
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:28,039
Dylan's mom.

1105
00:51:30,072 --> 00:51:31,772
Ah, well...

1106
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,940
I got to run.

1107
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:35,041
Oh, yeah, thank you.

1108
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:36,172
All right.
Bye, guys.

1109
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,306
OK, have... have a good one.

1110
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,376
Thanks.

1111
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:39,377
Bye.

1112
00:51:39,378 --> 00:51:41,578
I'm in.
Do you have a dental plan?

1113
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,207
All right, Marvin.

1114
00:51:44,215 --> 00:51:47,345
Your first assignment is to show us how
you handle those kids the way you do.

1115
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:48,918
Teach us.

1116
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:51,419
Let's put it this way. If this were a
business, and they were customers,

1117
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:52,951
how do you find out
what they want?

1118
00:51:52,955 --> 00:51:54,515
I'd put together a focus group.

1119
00:51:54,523 --> 00:51:56,290
All right, let's do it.

1120
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,831
What we'd like is for you to tell us what
you'd like to get out of daddy day care.

1121
00:51:59,832 --> 00:52:02,387
Help us to help you.

1122
00:52:03,063 --> 00:52:04,633
Who'd like to start?

1123
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:09,529
We need more learning
about things.

1124
00:52:09,535 --> 00:52:11,395
More learning about things?

1125
00:52:11,403 --> 00:52:12,503
Yes.

1126
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:15,272
We're at a very critical age.

1127
00:52:15,273 --> 00:52:17,641
You have to feed our minds.

1128
00:52:17,642 --> 00:52:19,982
OK, all right. You want to
write that down, Marvin?

1129
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:23,007
"Feed our minds."

1130
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:25,453
Great. OK, what else?

1131
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:30,078
Dolphins.
Dolphins are good.

1132
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:31,517
Dolphins are fish.

1133
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:32,618
No, they're not.

1134
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:34,319
Uh-huh, they live in water.

1135
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,820
That doesn't mean they're fish.

1136
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:38,221
Hey, hey, hey, let's calm down.
Lets about something else.

1137
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:40,363
What else would you like
to talk about?

1138
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:42,288
Where do babies come from?

1139
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:43,760
Um...

1140
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:46,931
Why don't we go back to the dolphin
subject and discuss dolphins,

1141
00:52:46,932 --> 00:52:50,060
or if there's anything else on someone
else's mind that we can talk about

1142
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,426
other than that.

1143
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,834
Write that down.

1144
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:54,769
OK, what else?

1145
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:56,900
Could we, um...

1146
00:52:56,905 --> 00:52:59,635
What were you
getting ready to say, Ben?

1147
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:02,041
Come on, I can see you were
getting ready to say something.

1148
00:53:02,043 --> 00:53:03,543
What is it, son?

1149
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:05,584
More, um...

1150
00:53:06,446 --> 00:53:07,676
Drawing?

1151
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,846
More drawings?

1152
00:53:08,847 --> 00:53:13,117
Yeah! Like pictures and stuff.
It's really fun.

1153
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:16,985
OK, yeah, great.
More drawings.

1154
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:19,017
Yeah! Yeah!

1155
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:20,692
More chasing bad guys.

1156
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:22,290
Excellent idea.

1157
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:23,821
We can chase joker.

1158
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,525
Well, wait a second, buddy.
That's Batman's bad guy.

1159
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:29,457
You're flash,
so you want to be chasing...

1160
00:53:29,463 --> 00:53:30,930
Lex Luthor?

1161
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:32,731
No. That's superman.

1162
00:53:32,732 --> 00:53:37,232
You want to be chasing captain boomerang,
gorilla grodd, reverse flash...

1163
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:38,595
the riddler?

1164
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,670

1199
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:46,671
starting tomorrow,
Phil is gonna be hosting

1200
00:55:46,672 --> 00:55:49,070
a three stooges film
festival in the T.V. Room.

1201
00:55:49,072 --> 00:55:51,241
I know everybody's looking
forward to that, right?

1202
00:55:51,242 --> 00:55:52,409
Thanks, daddy!

1203
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,837
And last, but not least,

1204
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:56,111
the thumb suckers support group
is going to be having a meeting

1205
00:55:56,112 --> 00:55:58,278
under the tree immediately
following, uh, nap time,

1206
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:00,507
which starts right after
you guys finish your snack.

1207
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:04,582
So, after you finish, grab a blanket, get
a spot, and we have, uh, we have that.

1208
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,481
Also, next week is going
to be Alpha girls group.

1209
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:10,421
And we're going to have
tai chi under the tree.

1210
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:13,719
And we're going to also have pet
day, so you bring your pets in,

1211
00:56:13,722 --> 00:56:16,322
Cool. Have pet show-and-tell.

1212
00:56:16,324 --> 00:56:20,392
This is my bunny.
His name is tiny.

1213
00:56:20,393 --> 00:56:23,728
I feed him a lot.
5 times a day.

1214
00:56:23,729 --> 00:56:27,259
He poops a lot, too.
6 times a day.

1215
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:29,425
It's like little marbles.

1216
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,667
This is my turtle, sparks.

1217
00:56:31,668 --> 00:56:35,838
He's fast. He's the fastest
turtle in the world.

1218
00:56:39,507 --> 00:56:42,367
Go! Go, sparks, go!

1219
00:56:45,946 --> 00:56:50,246
This is my parrot, Paulie. I'm
teaching him to talk. Talk.

1220
00:56:50,249 --> 00:56:52,879
Shut up, butthead.
Shut up, butthead.

1221
00:56:59,522 --> 00:57:01,222
OK, Becca, where's your pet?

1222
00:57:01,223 --> 00:57:05,258
I had a tarantula,
but I don't know where he is.

1223
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:08,789
OK, all right, don't panic.
Don't panic.

1224
00:57:08,795 --> 00:57:11,755
What do you mean, don't panic? There's
a big spider in here somewhere.

1225
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:13,264
I got a spider on my head!

1226
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,730
So what are we betting on today?

1227
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,865
I'm going to do
a diaper stroke, OK?

1228
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,370
All right.

1229
00:57:22,371 --> 00:57:26,441
Well, if it isn't the geniuses
that brought the world veggie-o's.

1230
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:29,109
So, how's unemployment?

1231
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,210
Actually, I've got the
best job I've ever had.

1232
00:57:31,779 --> 00:57:33,679
Yeah, it's a start-up.

1233
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,348
We offer time-management
facilitation

1234
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:38,118
to mostly working professionals.

1235
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:40,847
Well, that's a tough market.
Sounds pretty cutthroat.

1236
00:57:40,853 --> 00:57:42,593
Yeah. It's a real blood sport.

1237
00:57:42,594 --> 00:57:44,248
What's the money like?

1238
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:46,656
Bruce! Let's go, I got Botox.

1239
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,458
Hi, Charlie.
Hi, Phil.

1240
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,126
Hey, crispin.

1241
00:57:51,127 --> 00:57:52,287
What's up, little man?

1242
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:53,563
How do you know my kid?

1243
00:57:53,564 --> 00:57:56,431
They're his day care teachers,
what do you think?

1244
00:57:57,531 --> 00:58:00,331
Day care?
That's what it is?

1245
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:04,201
Oh, my God. You're wiping
boogers for a living.

1246
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:10,271
Losers, losers, losers.

1247
00:58:10,272 --> 00:58:13,112
Hey, you're paying us
to do it, too, you know.

1248
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:15,509
Losers.

1249
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:19,805
"Do you like
green eggs and ham?"

1250
00:58:19,814 --> 00:58:21,681
Yeah.

1251
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:27,052
"I do not like them, Sam-I-am. I
do not like green eggs and ham.

1252
00:58:27,053 --> 00:58:29,653
Would you like
to eat them here or there?"

1253
00:58:29,655 --> 00:58:31,515
Yeah.

1254
00:58:31,523 --> 00:58:33,523
"I would not like
to eat them anywhere.

1255
00:58:33,525 --> 00:58:35,485
"I do not like
green eggs and ham.

1256
00:58:35,493 --> 00:58:39,662
I do not like them,
Sam-I-am." OK?

1257
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:42,301
Now, see, he was going, he
was going to punch Sam-I-am,

1258
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:45,068
but he walked away. You don't punch, see?
He walked away with it.

1259
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:49,872
Where's mommy?

1260
00:58:51,137 --> 00:58:53,167
Mommy had to work today.

1261
00:58:54,973 --> 00:58:57,643
Remember when you used
to work all the times?

1262
00:58:57,644 --> 00:58:59,911
Yeah, back when
I had a real job.

1263
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,080
Mmm-hmm.
Do you miss work?

1264
00:59:04,146 --> 00:59:05,746
I guess.
I suppose so.

1265
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:07,447
I miss it.

1266
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:09,048
But don't get me wrong.
It's not like

1267
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,218
I don't like hanging out
with you guys, you know.

1268
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:12,777
It's just that daddy used to be

1269
00:59:12,785 --> 00:59:15,345
a big shot down at work.

1270
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:17,954
I had my own office
and a big, pretty view.

1271
00:59:17,956 --> 00:59:20,316
Remember that big,
pretty view daddy had?

1272
00:59:20,325 --> 00:59:23,425
I like it when you spin me
around in that cool chair.

1273
00:59:23,428 --> 00:59:25,688
Yeah, that's a cool chair.

1274
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:27,996
A lot of cool things
about that job.

1275
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,298
Cool chair,

1276
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:32,829
I had people
working underneath me,

1277
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,371
and, just between you and I,

1278
00:59:34,372 --> 00:59:36,328
the pay wasn't that bad either.

1279
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,096
OK, put that down.

1280
00:59:38,104 --> 00:59:39,504
What do you think of that?

1281
00:59:39,505 --> 00:59:41,065
What is it?

1282
00:59:41,073 --> 00:59:43,643
What do you mean?
It's a dog in the sunshine.

1283
00:59:43,644 --> 00:59:45,011
It doesn't look like one.

1284
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:46,740
That's because
it's kinda abstract.

1285
00:59:46,745 --> 00:59:48,475
You have to squint
when you look at it.

1286
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,710
Squint and look and see.

1287
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,314
And when you see it like this,

1288
00:59:51,315 --> 00:59:52,475
that's abstract.

1289
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:55,116
Yeah? You see it?

1290
00:59:55,117 --> 00:59:57,647
How about if you tilt
your head to the side?

1291
00:59:57,652 --> 00:59:58,952
No, the other way.

1292
00:59:58,953 --> 01:00:00,653
Still doesn't look like one.

1293
01:00:00,654 --> 01:00:03,054
OK, well, what are you over
there working on, Michelangelo?

1294
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:04,116
What you got?

1295
01:00:04,123 --> 01:00:05,663
What is that?

1296
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:15,963
There's nothing abstract
about that, now, is it?

1297
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:18,001
Thanks.

1298
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:20,855
That's pretty good.

1299
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:23,326
You got daddy's head
looking kind of round, though.

1300
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:25,025
Is my head that round?

1301
01:00:25,036 --> 01:00:27,266
No. But I got
your mustache.

1302
01:00:27,271 --> 01:00:29,901
Yeah, I see.
A nice green mustache.

1303
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:32,066
That's all right, son.

1304
01:00:32,074 --> 01:00:33,674
All right,
I just paid the mortgage,

1305
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,605
the car loan
and the electric bill.

1306
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:38,280
Look at the balance
in the checking account.

1307
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,246
74 cents.

1308
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:42,177
Yeah. That's right,
74 cents.

1309
01:00:42,182 --> 01:00:43,682
You are my superman.

1310
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:45,083
You got that right.

1311
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:46,651
I've been working hard,

1312
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:49,292
and I think it's time to let off a
little of this frustration I have.

1313
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:51,787
It's time for you to, uh,
take care of your superman.

1314
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:53,219
My superman.
Come here, baby.

1315
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:54,489
That's right.

1316
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,890
Oh, no, the monster's
going to get me! Oh, no!

1317
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:01,994
It's probably a nightmare.

1318
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:04,297
Be right back.

1319
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:06,458
OK, hurry up.
Mommy's coming!

1320
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:08,396
No, I want daddy.

1321
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:11,725
Did everything go OK?

1322
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:13,596
Yeah, everything's just fine.

1323
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,276
What's that face for?

1324
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,977
Since when does he like you
better than he likes me?

1325
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,910
No, don't even trip.
It's not like that.

1326
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,115
I've just been spending
more time with him,

1327
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,947
so he wanted me.

1328
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,521
He's getting
so much more confident.

1329
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:34,250
Remember in the beginning, how he
wouldn't play with anybody else?

1330
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:37,316
Now, he's even playing with
that kid, crispin.

1331
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:39,655
With crispin, who by the way
happened to say "thank you"

1332
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,160
at lunch today
without being told.

1333
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:42,991
And that little girl Becca,
she can read.

1334
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:44,456
She's just a baby.

1335
01:01:44,463 --> 01:01:45,933
I seen her pick up
a <i>curious George</i> book,

1336
01:01:45,934 --> 01:01:48,232
sit down
and read like a grownup.

1337
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:50,567
What's that face?

1338
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:53,565
You know, I haven't
seen you this excited

1339
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:55,400
about something in a long time.

1340
01:01:57,305 --> 01:01:59,705
Yeah, I ain't going to front.

1341
01:01:59,707 --> 01:02:03,076
Them little crumb snatchers
got under my skin.

1342
01:02:03,077 --> 01:02:07,246
Mrs. Plager, I cannot continue
to expose the other children

1343
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:09,207
to such dangerous,
self-destructive,

1344
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:10,705
highly addictive behavior.

1345
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:12,976
So either Juliette
stops the thumb sucking,

1346
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:16,524
or you'll just have to find
yourself another preschool.

1347
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:24,786
Um, are you busy?

1348
01:02:24,794 --> 01:02:27,094
Just pruning a few
weeds from the garden.

1349
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,596
What is it?

1350
01:02:28,597 --> 01:02:31,357
OK, I just thought
you should know

1351
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:34,733
we've lost 3 more students.

1352
01:02:34,735 --> 01:02:37,735
Are you seriously suggesting
you don't know where they are?

1353
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:39,498
No, ma'am.

1354
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,966
I know where they are.

1355
01:02:40,974 --> 01:02:42,314
So do I.

1356
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,207
Daddy day care.

1357
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:49,152
First, it was amusing.

1358
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:52,147
Then it was annoying.

1359
01:02:52,149 --> 01:02:56,079
Now it's really
starting to tick me off.

1360
01:02:56,086 --> 01:02:59,216
Get me a copy of <i>child day
care services regulations.</i>

1361
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:15,267
Uh-oh.

1362
01:03:15,268 --> 01:03:16,728
Hey, Phil, get the door.

1363
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:17,796
Huh?

1364
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:19,603
Get the door!

1365
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:20,971
Huh.

1366
01:03:20,972 --> 01:03:23,012
All right, I got it.
I got it.

1367
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,710
Oh, Mr. Kubitz.

1368
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:30,211
What... what are
you doing here?

1369
01:03:30,212 --> 01:03:31,782
Is this...
is this a bad time?

1370
01:03:31,783 --> 01:03:33,580
No, it's a great time.

1371
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:37,021
Well, is... is the... is the
man of the house at home?

1372
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,817
"Man of the house."

1373
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:40,648
Charlie!

1374
01:03:40,652 --> 01:03:43,152
Mr. Kubitz is here
from child services!

1375
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:45,123
I'll be right there.

1376
01:03:45,124 --> 01:03:48,260
So, uh, let me ask you.
W-w-where are the kids?

1377
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,658
Uh, outside. Marvin's
giving them a puppet show.

1378
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,329
Nice. What's
on the program?

1379
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,828
<i>Pinocchio?
Little red riding hood?</i>

1380
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:55,896
No, uh, <i>wrath of Khan.</i>

1381
01:03:55,897 --> 01:03:57,597
Hey, Mr. Kubitz. Hi!

1382
01:03:57,598 --> 01:03:59,728
Hey, you! Wait!
What are you doing?

1383
01:03:59,733 --> 01:04:00,799
What?

1384
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,170
What's wrong with your face?

1385
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,368
My face?

1386
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:05,269
What's all that stuff, man?
Come on.

1387
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:06,870
What's the matter with you?

1388
01:04:08,305 --> 01:04:09,965
Becca and Jamie.

1389
01:04:10,707 --> 01:04:12,507
Ah, if you'll excuse me,

1390
01:04:12,508 --> 01:04:14,608
I have to see, uh,
2 little girls

1391
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:16,240
because now I'm a big girl.

1392
01:04:16,244 --> 01:04:18,444
He's having fun with...

1393
01:04:18,446 --> 01:04:20,376
Mr. Kubitz, so what
brings you here today?

1394
01:04:20,381 --> 01:04:22,751
You know, I've... I've received
another complaint...

1395
01:04:22,752 --> 01:04:25,418
oh, I guess we know
who that came from.

1396
01:04:25,419 --> 01:04:28,289
Well, I understand that...
that you've acquired

1397
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,448
3 more children
since my last visit.

1398
01:04:30,456 --> 01:04:32,316
Yes. We're 14
altogether now.

1399
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:35,094
But it's still 3 adults, so we're
still under the 5:1 ratio.

1400
01:04:35,095 --> 01:04:36,293
Right.
But you see, Charlie,

1401
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:38,132
it's a totally
different issue this time.

1402
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,198
Charlie, can I talk
to you for a second?

1403
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:41,627
Oh, yeah, give me a sec...

1404
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:43,761
excuse me a second.
I'm going to go handle this.

1405
01:04:43,766 --> 01:04:45,126
Sure. Thanks..

1406
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:46,804
What's going on?

1407
01:04:54,409 --> 01:04:55,409
What's up?

1408
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,410
Flash is gone.

1409
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:58,181
What do you mean,
he's gone? Gone where?

1410
01:04:58,182 --> 01:04:59,379
I can't find him.

1411
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,310
You guys looked everywhere?
He's not in the garage?

1412
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,875
Everywhere.

1413
01:05:02,883 --> 01:05:04,020
What're we going to do?

1414
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:05,777
Is there some kind
of problem out here?

1415
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:07,245
No. Not at all,
Mr. Kubitz.

1416
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:09,791
We're just having a little
conversation about the...

1417
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:11,188
OK, because if it's...
you know...

1418
01:05:11,189 --> 01:05:12,959
no problem at all.
Why... why don't you...

1419
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,057
Hey, kids!

1420
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:16,088
Why don't you meet
our good friend, Mr. Kubitz.

1421
01:05:16,093 --> 01:05:17,159
Say hi.

1422
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,827
Hi, Mr. Kubitz.

1423
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:20,258
Hi, guys.

1424
01:05:20,262 --> 01:05:22,932
Hey, wouldn't it be nice if Mr.
Kubitz played with you guys

1425
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:25,131
while we had a little
important conversation?

1426
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:26,270
Would you be so kind?

1427
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,427
I-is that a good idea?

1428
01:05:27,434 --> 01:05:29,303
Yeah, we're having
a grown-up conversation

1429
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:30,732
the kids shouldn't be privy to.

1430
01:05:30,736 --> 01:05:32,296
So, just for a second.
Please.

1431
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:35,172
Oh, sure. That's different.

1432
01:05:35,173 --> 01:05:37,340
I'm gonna go upstairs.Yard.

1433
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:38,871
I'm gonna check the basement!

1434
01:05:40,343 --> 01:05:42,283
Do we have a basement?

1435
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:49,953
Flash!

1436
01:05:52,652 --> 01:05:53,922
Flash!

1437
01:05:55,053 --> 01:05:56,323
Flash!

1438
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:01,986
Flash!

1439
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:04,317
Flash!

1440
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,021
Flash!

1441
01:06:07,693 --> 01:06:10,063
We have to do the laundry.
God!

1442
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:17,227
Whoo-hoo!

1443
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,340
Flash!

1444
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:28,537
Oh, my God!
They vaporized him!

1445
01:06:28,543 --> 01:06:31,313
All right, he couldn't have gotten too far.
I'm gonna call the police.

1446
01:06:31,314 --> 01:06:32,442
I'll call his parents.

1447
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,746
If only I were a betazoid,
I could sense him.

1448
01:06:37,884 --> 01:06:39,653
Hey, which kid is this?

1449
01:06:39,654 --> 01:06:41,892
I don't know.
Hey, kid, what's your name?

1450
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,450
Tony.

1451
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:45,054
Tony. Tony.

1452
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:47,315
Flash's name is Tony.

1453
01:06:47,323 --> 01:06:49,123
Actually, flash's name
is Wally west...

1454
01:06:49,124 --> 01:06:50,424
hey, hey, hey, hey.

1455
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:58,926
Hey, Tony, how come you aren't
wearing your flash suit?

1456
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,562
I don't want
to be flash anymore.

1457
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:02,726
You don't want to be flash?
Who do you want to be?

1458
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:04,467
Tony.

1459
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:06,398
You want... did you hear that?
He wants to be Tony.

1460
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:07,736
Wants to be Tony.

1461
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:10,767
Oh, that's nice. You want to be Tony.
That's great.

1462
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:12,773
Hey, Tony, have a cookie.
Have a fresh one.

1463
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:15,605
What are you talking
about? Of course, I love you.

1464
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:18,041
I'm just not in love with you.

1465
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:20,776
15 months of
therapy, that's the best you can do?

1466
01:07:20,782 --> 01:07:24,017
That is the dumbest line
I have ever heard.

1467
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:27,519
My mother was right about you.

1468
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:31,615
Wait.

1469
01:07:31,623 --> 01:07:34,693
For what? You think this is gonna change?
You think I'm gonna change?

1470
01:07:34,694 --> 01:07:36,861
You think this is
what I had in mind?

1471
01:07:36,862 --> 01:07:39,260
Being a 55-year-old man,
living with his mother?

1472
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:41,962
You think that's my idea
of a good time?

1473
01:07:41,964 --> 01:07:44,364
I love
passive-aggressive losers.

1474
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:49,995
You know, a-according to
state regulations,

1475
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:52,203
a... a child-care center
in a family home

1476
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:55,435
is limited to
a maximum of 12 children.

1477
01:07:55,441 --> 01:07:58,476
I don't understand. 'Cause we have
plenty of room here for these kids.

1478
01:07:58,477 --> 01:08:00,607
Charlie, I don't make the
rules, I just enforce them.

1479
01:08:00,612 --> 01:08:02,581
You can't have more than 12 kids

1480
01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:03,910
at this kind of location.

1481
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:06,014
So what you are saying is if
we want to stay in business,

1482
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:07,146
we have to fire 2 kids.

1483
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:09,419
Unless you want to move
to a permanent facility

1484
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,918
somewhere else, then yes.

1485
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:20,491
So, who do we cut loose?

1486
01:08:20,493 --> 01:08:22,593
How about Becca and Jamie?

1487
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:25,299
I can't do it.

1488
01:08:26,131 --> 01:08:28,799
We gotta do something.

1489
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,830
Why don't we get a bigger space?

1490
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:34,937
"Space... the final frontier."

1491
01:08:34,938 --> 01:08:37,708
Marvin, I'm serious. Harridan said
we're not real. Let's get real.

1492
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:40,367
Let's get a bigger space, let's
get more kids, hire more people.

1493
01:08:40,376 --> 01:08:42,236
We'll give this woman
a run for her money.

1494
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:43,844
Great. Let's...
let's get a new space.

1495
01:08:43,845 --> 01:08:45,275
Yeah, final frontier!

1496
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,348
You know, if you don't
stop with that <i>Star Trek,</i>

1497
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:49,277
I'll push you in
that sticker bush. Stop!

1498
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:52,282
No! I'm saying that
there is a space available

1499
01:08:52,285 --> 01:08:54,485
called
"the final frontier."

1500
01:08:54,487 --> 01:08:57,217
This used to be
my home away from home.

1501
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:59,423
Jerry, the guy
who owned this place,

1502
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:02,385
he had the ultimate
collection of memorabilia.

1503
01:09:02,394 --> 01:09:03,934
Um, oh, you know what he had?

1504
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,688
Tricorder.

1505
01:09:05,696 --> 01:09:08,856
The... that ensign Riley wore
in "the doomsday machine."

1506
01:09:08,865 --> 01:09:10,825
Yeah, yeah,
I never saw that episode.

1507
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:14,368
I was with him,
not watching also.

1508
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:15,429
Oh!

1509
01:09:17,104 --> 01:09:18,704
Needs a lot of work.

1510
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:21,535
That just means we can fix it
up how we want to fix it up.

1511
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:23,671
Yeah, but we're gonna need
some money to do that.

1512
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:27,210
To make money,
you got to spend money.

1513
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:29,612
To spend money,
you got to have money.

1514
01:09:30,815 --> 01:09:33,275
"Rock for daddy day care.

1515
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:36,853
Help us finance
our new permanent home."

1516
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:39,689
Do you know what this means?

1517
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:41,590
It's a chance
to improve ourselves

1518
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,261
through a little
healthy competition?

1519
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,389
No, you bubble-headed idiot.

1520
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,763
It's a death sentence.

1521
01:09:46,764 --> 01:09:48,862
If they get their hands
on a big enough space,

1522
01:09:48,864 --> 01:09:50,030
they'll ruin me.

1523
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:51,301
They're selling fun.

1524
01:09:51,302 --> 01:09:53,398
I can't compete with fun.

1525
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,731
I should've crushed them
in the beginning

1526
01:09:57,736 --> 01:09:59,296
when they were weak.

1527
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:01,874
It'll be harder now,
but I have no choice.

1528
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:03,843
I've got to stop them.

1529
01:10:04,675 --> 01:10:06,065
How are you gonna do that?

1530
01:10:07,677 --> 01:10:10,077
By any means necessary.

1531
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:26,789
♪ Mother told me ♪

1532
01:10:26,793 --> 01:10:28,963
Yeah, ride the pony.

1533
01:10:29,828 --> 01:10:31,358
Pet the goat.

1534
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:35,362
Get a t-shirt made.
Something to eat.

1535

01:11:46,821 --> 01:11:49,821
You want me to baby-sit so you
can go to the movie, right?

I'll show you.

And then you paint yourself.

See? Put a little paint.

1580
01:12:59,644 --> 01:13:01,411

01:13:48,646 --> 01:13:50,976

01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:07,957
OK?

1599
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:24,238
H-how'd we do?

1600
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,639
We haven't even
put a dent in it.

1601
01:14:31,844 --> 01:14:32,877
Hello?

1602
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:34,638
Charlie, Jim fields.

1603
01:14:34,646 --> 01:14:36,306
Hey, how's your vacation going?

1604
01:14:36,314 --> 01:14:37,884
No, I'm just pulling your leg.

1605
01:14:37,885 --> 01:14:39,182
Listen, buddy,

1606
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,683
are you still looking for work?

1607
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:41,954
<i>'Cause I've got a job for you,</i>

1608
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:43,551
<i>unless you've got other offers.</i>

1609
01:14:43,552 --> 01:14:45,082
No, no,
that's really interesting.

1610
01:14:45,086 --> 01:14:46,816
It's, uh, that's interesting.

1611
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:48,991
But it's just... I've got
something going on right now.

1612
01:14:48,992 --> 01:14:50,049
Before you say no,

1613
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:51,556
let me fax you over
the proposal.

1614
01:14:51,557 --> 01:14:53,057
You can take a look
at the numbers,

1615
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:54,488
you think about it,

1616
01:14:54,492 --> 01:14:56,159
then you get back to me.

1617
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,190
Yeah.

1618
01:14:57,194 --> 01:14:58,761
<i>OK. Great.</i>

1619
01:14:58,762 --> 01:15:01,732
You say hi to the wife
and daughter... son.

1620
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,136
Miss harridan.
Let me guess.

1621
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,251
You couldn't get
child services to come back,

1622
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:20,107
so you're doing
the inspection yourself.

1623
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,245
I apologize.

1624
01:15:21,249 --> 01:15:22,819
I don't like to be sneaky.

1625
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:24,917
Still, rules are rules.

1626
01:15:24,919 --> 01:15:27,489
May I come in?
I have a proposition for you.

1627
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,348
Oh, yeah, please do.

1628
01:15:30,724 --> 01:15:35,264
Can I get you some, uh,
coffee or tea or water

1629
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:37,228
or eye of newt, maybe?

1630
01:15:37,229 --> 01:15:39,759
Water would be lovely.
Thank you.

1631
01:15:39,764 --> 01:15:41,264
Water.
That's an easy one.

1632
01:15:41,265 --> 01:15:43,465
You don't mind tap water,
do you?

1633
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:45,767
We're out of the bottled water.

1634
01:15:48,872 --> 01:15:50,072
Ahem.

1635
01:15:51,274 --> 01:15:53,874
So, miss harridan,
why are you here?

1636
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:59,112
You seem smart,
talented, highly ambitious.

1637
01:15:59,113 --> 01:16:01,813
What on earth are you doing
running a day care center?

1638
01:16:01,815 --> 01:16:04,245
Well, maybe I enjoy
running a day care center.

1639
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:05,350
Obviously.

1640
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:06,651
But is this really how you want

1641
01:16:06,652 --> 01:16:08,322
to spend the rest of your life?

1642
01:16:08,323 --> 01:16:09,520
As a businessman,

1643
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:12,089
you'd have money,
power, respect.

1644
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,890
You're really going to throw
that all away

1645
01:16:13,891 --> 01:16:15,691
just to baby-sit
a bunch of 3-year-old?

1646
01:16:15,692 --> 01:16:18,030
You know, I said I would
listen to your proposition.

1647
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:20,027
I'm all ears, and I've
got other things to do,

1648
01:16:20,029 --> 01:16:21,229
so if you'd be so kind...

1649
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:23,430
oh, all right.
Here it is:

1650
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:25,502
If daddy day care should close,

1651
01:16:25,503 --> 01:16:27,300
for whatever reason,

1652
01:16:27,301 --> 01:16:30,770
I'll take all your children
for the price you charge.

1653
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:34,506
Topflight education
at rock-bottom prices.

1654
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:36,107
Think about it.

1655
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:41,144
Now, wait a minute.

1656
01:16:41,145 --> 01:16:42,275
Mmm-hmm.

1657
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:44,979
You're blowing us off
for cottony cotton balls?

1658
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:47,349
No, cotton candy puffs.

1659
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,080
Apparently the whole thing
was my idea.

1660
01:16:49,085 --> 01:16:50,675
And they offered
to double my salary,

1661
01:16:50,686 --> 01:16:51,916
and let me run the division.

1662
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,950
So, yes,
I am taking myself back.

1663
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:56,855
Go ahead, if that's what's
important to you. I mean...

1664
01:16:56,857 --> 01:16:57,957
Phil and I can manage.

1665
01:16:57,958 --> 01:17:00,258
We'll just find
somebody else. Right?

1666
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,290
Uh, I... I'm going, too.

1667
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:08,326
This is, like, worse than
when Spock betrayed kirk

1668
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:09,302
on <i>Star Trek V.</i>

1669
01:17:09,303 --> 01:17:10,629
Hey, Marvin, it's not like that.

1670
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:12,200
We want you
to come back with us.

1671
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:15,001
And not in the mailroom this time.
We want you to be part of our team.

1672
01:17:15,003 --> 01:17:16,803
Whatever, I don't wanna
be on that team.

1673
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:18,204
I want to be on this team.

1674
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:20,435
We thought a lot
about this, man.

1675
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,810
It's a great opportunity.

1676
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,938
No, this right here
is a great opportunity.

1677
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:27,444
Marvin, this business... this
is the one that has limits.

1678
01:17:27,446 --> 01:17:29,106
And we've reached them, OK?

1679
01:17:29,114 --> 01:17:31,614
Me and Phil, we got
responsibilities to think about.

1680
01:17:31,616 --> 01:17:33,676
We got futures
to take into consideration.

1681
01:17:33,684 --> 01:17:36,124
What about right now?
What about the kids?

1682
01:17:36,519 --> 01:17:37,919
Hey...

1683
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,989
These kids were fine
before daddy day care,

1684
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:42,088
and they'll be fine
when it's over.

1685
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:44,720
You tell yourself that, Charlie.

1686
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:47,285
I finally found
a place where I fit in,

1687
01:17:47,294 --> 01:17:49,194
where I feel like I'm
doing something good,

1688
01:17:49,195 --> 01:17:50,785
and you guys just...

1689
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:52,426
You just spoil it all.

1690
01:17:59,436 --> 01:18:01,436
Well, that couldn't
have gone worse.

1691
01:18:01,438 --> 01:18:05,038
If you think that went bad,
wait till we tell the kids.

1692
01:18:20,952 --> 01:18:22,819
Can I go to work with you?

1693
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:24,620
Oh, no, you can't go
to work with me,

1694
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:26,390
but you can come
visit me at work.

1695
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:28,819
And daddy's gonna be home
at night and on the weekends.

1696
01:18:28,824 --> 01:18:31,124
You know, we can still have
lots of fun together.

1697
01:18:31,126 --> 01:18:33,856
Will Phil and Marvin
still be here?

1698
01:18:33,862 --> 01:18:35,231
No, I'm sorry, little man.

1699
01:18:35,232 --> 01:18:36,960
They're not going
to be around anymore.

1700
01:18:38,232 --> 01:18:40,932
It's just for a while, right?

1701
01:18:40,934 --> 01:18:44,704
Then you're going to come back
and do daddy day care again.

1702
01:18:46,072 --> 01:18:48,606
No, this is...
this is from now on.

1703
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:51,837
Daddy day care, we're not
doing that anymore, Ben.

1704
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:55,880
Let me explain it
to you like this, Ben:

1705
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:57,738
If daddy does this, right,

1706
01:18:57,746 --> 01:18:59,306
I can get money for us.

1707
01:18:59,314 --> 01:19:01,614
And I can use that money
to take care of the house

1708
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:04,546
and to buy food and clothes

1709
01:19:04,552 --> 01:19:06,552
and toys for you to play with.

1710
01:19:06,554 --> 01:19:09,389
I'll sell all my toys.

1711
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:12,058
Oh, why you want to sell
all your toys?

1712
01:19:12,059 --> 01:19:14,789
If I don't have toys,
we don't need money,

1713
01:19:14,795 --> 01:19:16,895
and you can stay with me.

1714
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,400
I wish it was that simple, Ben.

1715
01:19:25,671 --> 01:19:27,701
The development
department will have

1716
01:19:27,706 --> 01:19:29,606
the first samples
ready by next week.

1717
01:19:29,607 --> 01:19:31,837
OK, let's, uh, kick it around.

1718
01:19:31,842 --> 01:19:33,172
What do you think of

1719
01:19:33,176 --> 01:19:34,906
when you think of cotton candy?

1720
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,177
Clowns.

1721
01:19:36,178 --> 01:19:37,278
Chocolate.

1722
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:39,750
Cavities.

1723
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:44,215
Hyperactivity, cavities, and dentist bills.
That's what I...

1724
01:19:44,217 --> 01:19:45,917
Hey, look,
I've been to the other side,

1725
01:19:45,918 --> 01:19:47,118
and I've seen firsthand.

1726
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:48,719
When kids eat this kinda stuff,

1727
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:51,050
they come down crashing so
hard they need an air bag.

1728
01:19:51,055 --> 01:19:53,655
You know what the ingredients are
to these cotton candy balls?

1729
01:19:53,657 --> 01:19:54,657
Puffs.

1730
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:55,858
They're "puffs."
I'm sorry.

1731
01:19:55,859 --> 01:19:58,429
You know what's in here?
Red dye number 4 and sugar.

1732
01:19:58,430 --> 01:19:59,728
You know what, people?

1733
01:19:59,729 --> 01:20:02,059
Charlie is absolutely right.
You can't ignore the reality.

1734
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:03,433
Parents are not going to want

1735
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:05,232
to buy this product
for their kids.

1736
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,533
Not unless those kids
stomp and scream

1737
01:20:08,536 --> 01:20:10,636
and bang their little heads
on the floor

1738
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:12,238
till blood comes out
of their ears.

1739
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,609
Hey, Charlie, you got
those figures that I gave you?

1740
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,068
Yeah, I got them right here.

1741
01:20:17,076 --> 01:20:19,536
Just give me a second to...

1742
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:21,675
We had an independent
marketing firm

1743
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,210
do some preliminary research

1744
01:20:23,214 --> 01:20:26,749
to sort out the core value
of this product.

1745
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:29,620
The subjects that were tested,
aged 2 to 6,

1746
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:31,919
which are key branding years...

1747
01:20:33,321 --> 01:20:35,789
Charlie, you want to join us?

1748
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,590
I'm sorry about that,
Jim. Yeah.

1749
01:20:38,592 --> 01:20:42,261
Why don't you tell everybody
what the core value is?

1750
01:20:42,262 --> 01:20:44,632
What's the most important thing?

1751
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:49,571
My kid.

1752
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,040
Huh?

1753
01:20:54,905 --> 01:20:55,965
My kid, Jim,

1754
01:20:55,972 --> 01:20:58,740
that's the most
important thing. My kid.

1755
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:02,276
And I think I've made
a tremendous mistake.

1756
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:05,407
And so, uh, I quit.

1757
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:10,649
Ooh, what are you doing to me?

1758
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:12,181
You scared me.

1759
01:21:12,185 --> 01:21:13,615
How was the marketing meeting?

1760
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:14,919
I quit.

1761
01:21:15,754 --> 01:21:17,054
I quit.

1762
01:21:17,588 --> 01:21:18,648
You quit?

1763
01:21:18,655 --> 01:21:19,745
I quit and I feel great.

1764
01:21:19,756 --> 01:21:20,886
You should quit with me.

1765
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:21,920
I should quit?

1766
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:23,024
You should quit right now.

1767
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:24,185
We just got here.

1768
01:21:24,192 --> 01:21:26,462
You want to feel how I'm feeling?
Quit. Come on.

1769
01:21:26,463 --> 01:21:27,760
Quit!

1770
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:29,031
Quit with me.

1771
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:39,772
Hey, Marvin, you weren't going to
sell the carrot suit, were you?

1772
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:40,840
The kids love that.

1773
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,380
This stuff

1774
01:21:54,715 --> 01:21:56,915
is not for sale!

1775
01:21:57,984 --> 01:22:00,884
A literal reader
of the text might say

1776
01:22:00,886 --> 01:22:04,286
that Goldilocks
ate the "porridge"

1777
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:07,758
because she was "hungry."

1778
01:22:07,759 --> 01:22:10,427
But what would Freud say?

1779
01:22:10,428 --> 01:22:12,288
Language skills are
a critical component

1780
01:22:12,296 --> 01:22:14,556
of childhood development.

1781
01:22:14,564 --> 01:22:17,502
They're part of the core
curriculum here at Chapman.

1782
01:22:17,503 --> 01:22:19,470
If you'll follow me this way.

1783
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,165
On the path of life,

1784
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,238
the proper first
steps are essential.

1785
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:28,608
With our firm guidance,
your children

1786
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:31,839
will take those steps
right here at Chapman.

1787
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:33,205
Our philosophy

1788
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:36,048
is that a child is like
a climbing vine.

1789
01:22:36,049 --> 01:22:37,749
With structure to cling to,

1790
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,350
and the right gardener
to tend them,

1791
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:41,151
they'll grow to the sky.

1792
01:22:41,152 --> 01:22:42,892
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

1793
01:22:44,355 --> 01:22:45,645
We're not talking about plants,

1794
01:22:45,656 --> 01:22:47,116
we're talking about kids.

1795
01:22:47,124 --> 01:22:49,262
I know you people don't
want this woman pruning

1796
01:22:49,263 --> 01:22:51,359
and cutting and weeding
your 3-year-old.

1797
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:53,891
Some people are uncomfortable
with achievement.

1798
01:22:53,896 --> 01:22:55,896
No, what I'm uncomfortable with

1799
01:22:55,898 --> 01:22:58,668
is treating a little kid
like it's an adult.

1800
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,327
If you people
let your kids come here,

1801
01:23:00,335 --> 01:23:02,495
they're gonna be miserable
in 4 different languages.

1802
01:23:02,503 --> 01:23:03,536
5.

1803
01:23:03,537 --> 01:23:05,697
We start Portuguese in the fall.

1804
01:23:07,106 --> 01:23:09,136
How many languages
do you listen to them in?

1805
01:23:09,141 --> 01:23:11,671
You ever just take a break and
stop trying to shove knowledge

1806
01:23:11,676 --> 01:23:13,436
down their throat
and just talk to them?

1807
01:23:13,444 --> 01:23:15,044
Listen to 'em and
see what they want.

1808
01:23:15,045 --> 01:23:16,035
They're children,

1809
01:23:16,046 --> 01:23:17,376
they don't know what they want.

1810
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,980
Yes, they do know
what they want.

1811
01:23:18,981 --> 01:23:21,011
All of them.
And they're all different.

1812
01:23:21,016 --> 01:23:22,846
We took some time,
we talked to the kids,

1813
01:23:22,851 --> 01:23:24,151
got to know them a little bit.

1814
01:23:24,152 --> 01:23:25,892
And it made a difference.
It helped them.

1815
01:23:25,893 --> 01:23:28,347
Oh, please.
Share your success.

1816
01:23:28,356 --> 01:23:30,016
Why don't you tell
these people exactly

1817
01:23:30,024 --> 01:23:31,564
how you help their children?

1818
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,829
Max.

1819
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,060
Max over here is
potty-trained now, OK?

1820
01:23:41,065 --> 01:23:42,355
I don't miss.

1821
01:23:42,366 --> 01:23:44,496
That's right.
And Becca learned how to read.

1822
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:46,168
Yes, I did.

1823
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:47,399
And crispin.

1824
01:23:47,403 --> 01:23:50,303
Crispin is the most polite kid
you'd ever want to meet.

1825
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:51,935
Thank you, Charlie.

1826
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:54,106
You are most welcome, crispin.

1827
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:56,507
And I made friends.

1828
01:23:58,877 --> 01:24:01,307
That's right, little man,
you made some friends.

1829
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:04,209
As of this moment,

1830
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:07,781
daddy day care
is back in business.

1831
01:24:10,651 --> 01:24:13,321
Don't be a fool.
You won't make a nickel.

1832
01:24:13,322 --> 01:24:15,620
Yeah, we might not get rich,
but we'll manage.

1833
01:24:15,622 --> 01:24:16,788
Excuse me.

1834
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:19,159
All right, huh?
How about that?

1835
01:24:19,825 --> 01:24:20,885
Hey, all right.

1836
01:24:20,892 --> 01:24:21,962
Daddy.

1837
01:24:25,028 --> 01:24:26,088
Hey listen,

1838
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:27,925
any boob can run
a child-care center.

1839
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,899
It takes a family
to raise some children.

1840
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:32,268
That's what we're going to be
from now on, a family.

1841
01:24:32,269 --> 01:24:34,827
Family?
What a laughable concept!

1842
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,136
Well, we'll going to just laugh
our way down the driveway.

1843
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:39,738
You have
bye, Miss Harridan. S. Harridan.

1844
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:42,270
Bye, miss harridan.

1845
01:24:56,789 --> 01:24:59,157
Come on! Let's go!

1846
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:02,958
Get in there! Come on!
Let's go! Come on!

1847
01:25:05,262 --> 01:25:06,962
Come on! Hold up!

1848
01:25:10,766 --> 01:25:12,366
OK, everybody's
holding hands, right?

1849
01:25:12,367 --> 01:25:13,397
Yeah, right.

1850
01:25:17,972 --> 01:25:19,172
Let's go.

1851
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,444
"Daddy day care."

1852
01:25:26,078 --> 01:25:28,846
Jennifer, how could you?

1853
01:25:28,847 --> 01:25:30,877
It's a really
great place to work.

1854
01:25:30,882 --> 01:25:32,252
You should apply there.

1855
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:35,154
Or not.

1856
01:25:38,587 --> 01:25:40,287
Have a nice day, miss harridan.

1857
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:41,991
That's nice.

1858
01:25:51,095 --> 01:25:52,385

You know, we can't spend
money without having it.

01:28:13,805 --> 01:28:15,928
Hold on one second.

1924
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:17,933

<i>Action.</i>

1928

Hey, what are you doing to me?

1929
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:26,543
Pudding on my hand.

1930
01:28:29,809 --> 01:28:31,379
OK, wait a minute.

1931
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:38,410
Take you for instance, I would
never push you in a sticker bush.

1932
01:28:38,415 --> 01:28:39,645
You couldn't push me.

1933
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:41,119
No, I'd use a shovel on you.

1934
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:45,946
Busy.

1935
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:47,893
Some other kids around here
hanging out with you.

1936
01:28:47,894 --> 01:28:49,089
How that sound?

1937
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:51,620
Whoa! See, you going to
have to work on it.

1938
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:52,915
<i>Mazel Tov.</i>

1939
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:55,286
Remember when
you broke my yo-yo?

1940
01:28:55,295 --> 01:28:56,325
I broke...

1941
01:28:56,329 --> 01:28:58,359
and you... and you never
gave me a new one.

1942
01:28:58,364 --> 01:29:01,132
That's why you sent me to bed.

1943
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:03,033
Wow, you've been writing.

1944
01:29:03,034 --> 01:29:07,003
No, I can't... I can't
even write my letters.

1945
01:29:07,004 --> 01:29:08,974
<i>What's going on here?</i>

1946
01:29:12,508 --> 01:29:14,238
You're killing me.

1947
01:29:14,243 --> 01:29:16,811
You're really killing me.

1948
01:29:16,812 --> 01:29:19,246
Joe Frazier's smokin' skillets!

1949
01:29:22,049 --> 01:29:25,349
These skillets were made
in the city of brotherly love.

1950
01:29:26,519 --> 01:29:28,289
That's good...
that's a good thing.

1951
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,017
OK, Eddie.

1952
01:29:30,022 --> 01:29:33,162
They gave you a little too
much direction, didn't they?

1953
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:42,298
OK, stop before
you pee on yourself.

1954
01:29:42,299 --> 01:29:43,357
What is my line?

1955
01:29:43,364 --> 01:29:44,504
"I'll sell
all my toys."

1956
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:46,866
I'll sell all my toys.

1957
01:29:46,867 --> 01:29:48,667
I'll say my other
line over again,

1958
01:29:48,668 --> 01:29:51,038
because I messed it up. So let
me say it again. I say, "you..."

1959
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:52,137
action!

1960
01:29:52,138 --> 01:29:54,638
OK, thank you.

1961
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,770
<i>Let it go for a second. There.</i>

1962
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:58,165
<i>Thank you.</i>

1963
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:02,080
That's why I know we
haven't been to the moon.

1964
01:30:04,581 --> 01:30:08,221
Miss harridan says it's
preparing me for my future.

1965
01:30:12,853 --> 01:30:13,993
You hungry?

1966
01:30:15,421 --> 01:30:16,421
Yeah.

1967
01:30:16,422 --> 01:30:17,952
What do you feel like eating?

1968
01:30:17,956 --> 01:30:19,886
I want a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

1969
01:30:19,891 --> 01:30:22,121
Peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

1970
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:23,256
I don't know.

1971
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,360
After this scene.

1972
01:30:24,361 --> 01:30:25,728
If I give you...

1973
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,430
What's so funny?
