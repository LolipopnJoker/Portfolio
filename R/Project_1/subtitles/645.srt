1
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,730
Beg your pardon. Forgot to knock.

2
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,070
<i>Ni odnoho vyzdoha! Gdye vashy?</i>

3
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,990
I'm alone.

4
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,070
Aren't we all?

5
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,580
- You're late, 007.
- I had to stop in the bathroom.

6
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,760
- Ready to save the world again?
- After you, 006.

7
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,180
- James... For England.
- For England, Alec.

8
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,060
- It's too easy.
- Half of everything is luck, James.

9
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,900
And the other half?

10
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,690
Fate.

11
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,520
- Six minutes.
- Six minutes. Check.

12
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,770
Fire!

13
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,440
- Closing time, James! Last call!
- Buy me a pint.

14
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,710
This is Colonel Ourumov!
Come out with your hands up!

15
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,590
How original.

16
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,970
Shut the door, Alec! There's a draught!

17
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,260
Alec?

18
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,900
Move out. Throw down your weapon
and walk towards me, slowly.

19
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,830
- Finish the job, James! Blow them to hell!
- You have ten seconds.

20
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,460
Ten.

21
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,920
Nine, eight,

22
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,050
seven, six,

23
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,510
five, four,

24
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,260
- three, two...
- For England, James!

25
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,510
Hold your fire! You'll blow the gas tanks!

26
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,480
This is your last chance!
Come out with your hands...

27
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,320
Wait!

28
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,150
You can't win.

29
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,470
Get out there! Move! Move it!

30
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,270
Hold your fire!

31
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,110
Wait!

32
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:35,250
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

33
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,700
<i>See reflections on the water</i>

34
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,450
<i>More than darkness in the depths</i>

35
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,010
<i>See him surface in every shadow</i>

36
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,010
<i>On the wind, I feel his breath</i>

37
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,310
<i>GoldenEye, I've found his weakness</i>

38
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,230
<i>GoldenEye, he'll do what I please</i>

39
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>GoldenEye, no time for sweetness</i>

40
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,820
<i>But a bitter kiss
will bring him to his knees</i>

41
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,120
<i>See him move
through smoke and mirrors</i>

42
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,580
<i>Feel his presence in the crowd</i>

43
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>Other girls, they gather around him</i>

44
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,850
<i>If I had him, I wouldn't let him out</i>

45
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,520
<i>GoldenEye, not lace or leather</i>

46
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,270
<i>Golden chain, take him to the spot</i>

47
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,200
<i>GoldenEye, I'll show him forever</i>

48
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,570
<i>It'll take forever to see what I've got</i>

49
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,120
<i>You'll never know</i>

50
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,740
<i>Howl watched you
from the shadows as a child</i>

51
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,500
<i>You'll never know</i>

52
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,260
<i>How it feels
to get so close and be denied</i>

53
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,470
<i>It's</i> a <i>golden honey trap</i>

54
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,890
<i>I've got for you tonight</i>

55
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,480
<i>Revenge, it's a kiss</i>

56
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,770
<i>This time I won't miss</i>

57
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,110
<i>Now I've got you in my sight</i>

58
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,040
<i>With a GoldenEye</i>

59
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>Golden, GoldenEye</i>

60
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,250
<i>With a GoldenEye</i>

61
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,470
<i>GoldenEye</i>

62
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,030
- James, is it necessary to drive so fast?
- More often than you'd think.

63
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,970
I enjoy a spirited ride
as much as the next girl, but...

64
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,680
- Who's that?
- The next girl.

65
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,370
James, stop this! Stop it!

66
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,710
- I know what you're doing.
- What's that, dear?

67
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,000
You are just trying to show off
the size of your...

68
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,250
- Engine?
- Ego.

69
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,130
We're having a pleasant drive
and you bring psychology into it.

70
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,600
- I was just sent here to evaluate you.
- Let's put that behind us, shall we?

71
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,140
Ladies first.

72
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,990
James, I want you to stop this car!

73
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,660
- Really?
- Stop this car at once!

74
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,080
As you can see, I have no problem
with female authority.

75
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,880
Huh!

76
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,470
James, you're incorrigible.

77
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,420
What am I going to do with you?

78
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,930
Let's toast your evaluation, shall we?

79
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,440
A very thorough evaluation.

80
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,300
<i>Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.
Trés heureux de vous revoir.</i>

81
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,630
<i>- Bonsoir, Pierre. Ca Va bien?
- Trés bien. Et vous?</i>

82
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
<i>Sept à la banque.</i>

83
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,710
Madame wins.

84
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,130
Bet, mademoiselle? Non?

85
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,880
Monsieur.

86
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,100
Bets, ladies and gentlemen?

87
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,720
- No players?
- Banco.

88
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,790
It appears we share the same passions.

89
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,700
Three, anyway.

90
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,280
I count two - motoring and... baccarat.

91
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,290
<i>Huit, pour la banque.</i>

92
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,130
Seven. Madame wins.

93
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,140
I hope the third
is where your real talent lies.

94
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,130
One rises to meet a challenge.

95
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,850
Double.

96
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,980
<i>Suivez.</i>

97
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,610
Ca rte.

98
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,720
Madame stands with five.

99
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,230
- Six. Madame loses.

100
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,860
- Enjoy it... while it lasts.
- The very words I live by.

101
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,190
And what words do you live by?

102
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,410
- The trick is to quit while you're ahead.
- That's one trick I've never learned.

103
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,740
Perhaps you'll show me how it's done.

104
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,540
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

105
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,800
And for you?

106
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,050
The same.

107
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,220
How do you take it?

108
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,430
Straight up, with a twist.

109
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,140
Thank you, Mr...

110
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,350
The name's Bond. James Bond.

111
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,850
Xenia Zaragevna Onatopp.

112
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,060
- Onatopp?
- OnatOPP.

113
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,070
- Your accent... Georgian?
- Mm! Very good, Mr Bond.

114
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,620
- You've been to Russia.
- Not recently.

115
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,420
I used to drop in occasionally.
Shoot in and out.

116
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,670
It's very different now.
A land of opportunity.

117
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,170
With a new Ferrari in every garage?

118
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,550
No, not quite. That belongs to a friend.

119
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:03,600
The French number
plates for this year's model start with "L".

120
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,310
Even the counterfeit ones.

121
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,610
Oh. And what rank do you hold with
the motor vehicles department, Mr Bond?

122
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,280
Commander.

123
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,610
Shall we go?

124
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,700
This one is an admiral.

125
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,280
I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank.

126
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,830
Nice to meet you, Mr Bond.

127
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,000
The pleasure, I'm sure, was all mine.

128
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,470
<i>Transmission begins from Moneypenny.</i>

129
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,340
<i>Onatopp, Xenia. Ex-Soviet fighter pilot.</i>

130
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,350
<i>Current suspected links to the Janus
crime syndicate, St Petersburg.</i>

131
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,150
<i>Yacht "Manticore" is leased
to a known Janus corporate front.</i>

132
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,610
<i>M authorizes you
to observe Miss Onatopp,</i>

133
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,190
<i>but stipulates no... contact
without prior approval.</i>

134
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,690
<i>End of transmission. Moneypenny.</i>

135
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,990
<i>Good night, James. I trust
you'll stay... "onatopp" of things</i>

136
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,780
Xenia, I... can't... breathe!

137
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,130
Yes! Yes!

138
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,190
<i>Merci, Mon amiral.</i>

139
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,700
My respects, Admiral.

140
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,530
Delighted to have you aboard,
mademoiselle.

141
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,420
please take your <i>seats</i>
for the demonstration of the aircraft.

143
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,510
What you are about to see is Europe's
answer to the electronic battle?

144
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,130
The first working prototype
of the Tiger helicopter.

145
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,960
Uniquely maneuverable, the Tiger
not only uses Stealth technology,

146
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,350
it is hardened against all forms
of electronic interference,

147
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,100
radio jamming
and electromagnetic radiation.

148
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,280
Shh. I have a small surprise from
your friends back at the barracks.

149
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,580
I think I've gone to heaven.

150
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,370
Not yet.

151
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,210
Please welcome the pilots.

152
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,640
Lieutenant Commander Bernard Jaubert
and Lieutenant François Brouse.

153
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,330
Select Mir.

154
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,540
Orthographic projection.

155
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,090
Compute possible intercept
with second-stage Geo-sat two.

156
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,100
Anna.

157
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,770
He wouldn't know a woman
if one came up and sat on his head.

158
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,850
Bods

159
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,900
- Boris!
- What?

160
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,700
I thought I'd post it
on the Internet, no?

161
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,160
- What's the password?
- I made it easy this time.

162
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,620
Even you should be able to break it,
borscht-for-brains.

163
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,130
All right. All right. I'll give you a hint.

164
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:19,800
They're right in front of you
and can open very large doors.

165
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
You're such a geek.

166
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,100
Yes! I'm in.

167
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,070
You've hacked into
the US Department of Justice.

168
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,240
What if they trace it here?

169
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,190
The chief of computers will call me
a genius, move me to Moscow

170
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,780
and give me a million bucks
hard currency.

171
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,870
I think not.

172
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,080
Besides, the Americans are slug-heads.
They'll never detect me.

173
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,220
You were saying, slug-head?

174
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,170
Nobody screws with Boris Grishenko.

175
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,220
<i>- Spiked them!
- Come on, Boris. Just hang up.</i>

176
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,140
No way! I spiked them.

177
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,730
- All right. What's the password?
- I'm not going to tell you.

178
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,690
OK. Let me guess.

179
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,450
- It's not in front of me?
- Mm-mm.

180
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,070
You sit on it,
but you can't take it with you.

181
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,490
My program seizes the phone line
of whoever's tracing me

182
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,920
and jams their modem
so they can't hang up.

183
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,830
Now the hunted becomes the hunter.

184
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,310
"Better luck next time,

185
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,310
slug-heads

186
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,720
Bang! Gone! I am invincible!

187
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,950
Was it good for you, too?

188
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,620
I'm getting some coffee.

189
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,610
I'm going for a cigarette.

190
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,640
General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov,
head of Space Division.

191
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,320
- General, if I'd known...
- You'd have been ready.

192
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,620
This is an unscheduled test
of Severnaya, Major. War simulation.

193
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,130
We are going to test-? re GoldenEye.
Report your status.

194
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Two operational satellites, sir, Petya and
Mischa, in 90-minute earth orbit at 100km.

195
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,630
Good.

196
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Here is the authorization code.

197
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,920
Now, the GoldenEye and today's access
numbers for satellite Petya, please.

198
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,180
Lam timing you.

199
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,880
Good. Thank you, Major.

200
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,210
On my count.

201
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,640
Three... two... one...

202
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,440
Set target. Severnaya.

203
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,160
Arm the weapon.

204
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Check it.

205
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,530
Their best response time
is 19 minutes. They'll be late.

206
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,490
It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.

207
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,280
- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.

208
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,530
M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.

209
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,950
- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.

210
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,870
Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?

211
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,540
I know you'll find this crushing, O07,

212
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,380
but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident

213
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,840
so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.

214
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,600
I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theater.

215
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,260
Moneypenny, I'm devastated.

216
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,630
What would I ever do without you?

217
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,890
As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.

218
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,280
Hope springs eternal.

219
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,030
This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.

220
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:20,580
Really? What's the penalty for that?

221
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,900
Someday you have to make good
on your innuendos.

222
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,500
- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.

223
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,260
<i>- Good evening, O07.
- Tanner. What's up?</i>

224
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,050
16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call

225
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,140
from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.

226
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:56,900
- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?

227
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,320
Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.

228
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,450
Mm-hm.

229
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,490
- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...

230
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,790
Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.

231
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,710
- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.

232
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,920
The prime minister's
waiting for an update.

233
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,050
Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.

234
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,300
Thank you.

235
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,230
Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off

236
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,140
and the Russians
had three MIG intercept it.

237
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,730
What do you think the base is used for?

238
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,650
We suspected it might be
the ground station

239
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,570
for a secret space-based
weapon called GoldenEye, but...

240
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,530
Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.

241
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,660
Numbers were never my strong suit.

242
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,210
Are these pictures live?

243
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:57,090
Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.

244
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,530
Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.

245
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,260
What the bloody hell was that?

246
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,230
Argh!

247
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,810
Aaarghhhh!

248
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,590
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.

249
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,600
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!

250
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,430
Argh!

251
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,930
Boris! Boris!

252
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,350
Thanks.

253
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:25,810
Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.

254
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,410
We have another,
coming into range... now.

255
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,290
Good God.

256
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,740
Two of the MIG are down.

257
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,250
It looks like the third went into the dish.

258
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,370
What do you think?

259
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,540
No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.

260
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,590
- EMP?
- It would explain the MIG and satellites.

261
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,470
- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.

262
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,550
- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.

263
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,730
I've read the brief.

264
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.

265
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,690
Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.

266
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,030
The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.

267
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,620
So, Golden Eye exists.

268
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,330
Yes.

269
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,870
- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.

270
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,420
For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.

271
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,090
Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.

272
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,520
- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.

273
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,600
I know the Russian fail-safe systems.

274
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:49,850
You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.

275
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,610
There had to be an insider.

276
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,990
At least one person
probably knows who it is.

277
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,150
Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.

278
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,700
The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".

279
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,950
Governments change.
The lies stay the same.

280
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,040
What else do we know about Janus?

281
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,500
Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.

282
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,550
Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.

283
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,000
The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.

284
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,210
The woman, Onatopp,

285
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,470
is our only confirmed contact.

286
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,260
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.

287
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,390
- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.

288
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,220
- Ice?
- Yes.

289
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,870
We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.

290
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,080
The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.

291
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,340
Ourumov. They made him a general.

292
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,380
He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".

293
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,430
Our political analysts say
he doesn't? t the profile of a traitor.

294
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,510
Are these the same analysts who said
that GoldenEye couldn't exist?

295
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,640
Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?

296
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,900
You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.

297
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,950
You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.

298
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,410
- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.

299
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,740
Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,

300
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,920
a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,

301
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,590
obviously appealed to that
young woman I sent out to evaluate you.

302
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,920
- Point taken.
- Not quite, O07.

303
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,720
If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,

304
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,170
your instincts are dead wrong.

305
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,220
I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.

306
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,890
But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.

307
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
I want you to find GoldenEye.

308
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,030
Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.

309
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,650
If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,

310
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:50,030
don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.

311
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,040
- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.

312
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,870
Never.

313
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,380
Bond...

314
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,880
Come back alive.

315
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,760
Good morning, General Ourumov.

316
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,180
Defense Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.

317
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,060
Please, deliver your report.

318
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,030
As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -

319
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,200
was detonated over Severnaya.

320
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,910
As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.

321
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:17,580
I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists

322
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,290
seeking to create political unrest.

323
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:25,840
Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya

324
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,760
have been set back by several years.

325
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,130
Therefore, I tender my resignation.

326
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,730
It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.

327
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,270
Merely your assurance that
there are no other GoldenEyes.

328
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,980
I can give you that assurance,
Defense Minister.

329
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,060
And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?

330
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,830
I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.

331
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,040
There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.

332
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,330
Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.

333
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,090
I will investigate immediately.

334
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,550
It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists

335
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:13,050
before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.

336
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:17,350
- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defense Minister.

337
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,110
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

338
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,530
That will be all.

339
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,880
Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?

340
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,830
Hunting.

341
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,380
Right. Now pay attention, O07.

342
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,460
First, your new car.

343
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:56,130
BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.

344
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,850
Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.

345
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,560
Now, this I'm particularly proud of.

346
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,570
Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.

347
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,320
Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.

348
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:19,080
Need I remind you, O07, that you have
a license to kill, not break the traffic laws.

349
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,200
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.

350
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,330
Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.

351
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:31,430
A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.

352
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:35,760
Have you finished?

353
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,340
- Yes.
- Good.

354
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,430
- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.

355
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,860
Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.

356
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,150
Fire, and out shoots a piton,

357
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,190
followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.

358
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:55,530
I see. And what if I need
additional support?

359
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,200
It's tested for one, O07.

360
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:06,000
Flight 878 to St Petersburg.

361
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,500
X-ray document scanner.

362
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,880
A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.

363
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:17,510
Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.

364
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,800
Another three disarms it.

365
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,890
How long did you say the fuse was?

366
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,570
Oh, grow up, O07.

367
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,770
- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.

368
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:36,910
Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.

369
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,660
Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.

370
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,040
- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?

371
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,170
Along with the rest of him.

372
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,760
Now, 007, do please try and return...

373
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,730
Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.

374
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,730
Don't touch that! That's my lunch.

375
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,920
In London, April's a spring month.

376
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,670
Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?

377
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,840
For crying out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,

378
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,350
with your secret codes and passwords.

379
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,680
One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.

380
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,600
Come on. My car's over there.

381
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,990
- After you.
- Thank you.

382
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,080
- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.

383
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,790
In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.

384
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,750
- Close enough for government work?
- No.

385
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,970
- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.

386
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,730
All right, all right, all right.

387
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,530
- "Ml-iffy"?
- Third wife.

388
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,530
<i>- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.</i>

389
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,610
- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.

390
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,830
Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.

391
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,630
Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?

392
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:05,180
St Petersburg express
has now arrived at Platform 3.

393
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,690
Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?

394
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,810
- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.

395
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:21,400
No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.

396
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,070
KGB, military. Screwdriver.

397
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:30,250
Rumor has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.

398
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,450
That armored stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.

399
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,880
Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?

400
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,420
No, the bigger one. The sledge.

401
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:44,840
Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.

402
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,800
Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.

403
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,010
Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.

404
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,650
- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.

405
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,230
Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.

406
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,820
- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.

407
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,870
- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.

408
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,680
Yes?

409
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,110
- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?

410
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,360
24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.

411
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,820
IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.

412
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,950
- You pay dollars?
- Of course.

413
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,200
If madam requires a demonstration...

414
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:58,490
Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.

415
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,550
Natalya.

416
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,110
- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.

417
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,970
Let me get this straight, Jimmy.

418
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,800
You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.

419
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,230
And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?

420
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,810
- Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?

421
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,020
- No. His wallet.
- That might work.

422
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,570
OK. Showtime.

423
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,570
Valentin operates
out of building number 23.

424
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,740
Are you sure you wanna do this?

425
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:22,370
Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.

426
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:26,500
Make sure they send me home first class.

427
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,600
Natalya! It's me! It's Boris!

428
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,730
It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.

429
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,150
Shh-shh-shh.

430
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,450
Another morning shot to hell.

431
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,360
Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.

432
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,130
Walther PPK, 7.65mm.

433
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:52,430
Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.

434
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,380
- Lucky me.
- I think not.

435
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,050
<i>Ooh-ahh</i>

436
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,730
And if you love him

437
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,980
<i>Love him</i>

438
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,020
<i>Oh, be so proud of him</i>

439
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,190
<i>Of him</i>

440
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,990
<i>Cos after all</i>

441
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,560
<i>He's just a man</i>

442
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,780
<i>Stand by your man...</i>

443
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,000
James Bond.

444
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,950
Charming, sophisticated secret agent.

445
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,670
"Shaken, but not stirred."

446
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,630
I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humor, Valentin.

447
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,100
Or your need for an audience.

448
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,930
- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?

449
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:46,230
<i>Stand by your man</i>

450
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,820
That is Irina, my mistress.

451
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,730
Very talented girl.

452
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,280
Irina! Take a hike!

453
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,080
So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you
to my neighbourhood? Hm?

454
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,470
Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?

455
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,260
I hear the new M is a lady.

456
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,340
I want you to do me a favour.

457
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,730
He wants me to do him a favour!

458
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:32,810
My knee aches every single day.
Twice <i>as</i> bad when it is cold.

459
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,520
Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?

460
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,120
- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...

461
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,860
Silence!

462
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,410
For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.

463
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:49,290
Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to...

464
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:51,710
Miss the rest of you.

465
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:57,420
- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.

466
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,760
Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.

467
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:08,600
Kirov‘s funeral parlor,
four o'clock this afternoon.

468
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,930
200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.

469
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,480
Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,

470
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,110
their man drives the hearse out.

471
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,910
Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.

472
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,990
Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.

473
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:27,120
Your money.

474
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,920
And what do I owe
for this accommodation?

475
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:33,630
I want you to set me up... with Janus.

476
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:38,580
- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.

477
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,010
- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.

478
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,140
- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.

479
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:51,310
They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.

480
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,110
- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?

481
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,940
This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.

482
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,360
The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.

483
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,030
You know your history.
At the end of the war,

484
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:08,710
the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,

485
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:13,250
believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.

486
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:16,960
But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,

487
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,880
who promptly had them all shot.

488
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,550
Women, children, families.

489
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,810
Not exactly our? nest hour.

490
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,980
Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.

491
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:34,100
I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.

492
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:38,530
- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and...

493
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,740
- he owes me one.
- Precisely.

494
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,050
You don't need the gun... Commander.

495
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,220
That depends on
your definition of safe sex.

496
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,320
That's close enough.

497
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,930
Not for what I have in mind.

498
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,550
Oh, you think you can hurt me?

499
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,990
You think you can break me?

500
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,000
Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!

501
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,470
No, no, no.

502
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,010
No more foreplay.

503
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,680
Take me to Janus.

504
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,760
!

505
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,650
- This is it?
- Yes.

506
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,450
Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.

507
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,540
- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.

508
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:47,000
- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.

509
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:51,380
Sweet dreams.

510
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,580
Hello, James.

511
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,490
- Alec?
- Back from the dead.

512
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,070
No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.

513
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:40,780
What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?

514
01:08:42,570 --> 01:08:44,670
Why?

515
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,880
Hilarious question. Particularly from you.

516
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:54,790
Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,

517
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,220
only to come home - "Well done!
Good job, but sorry, old boy."

518
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,550
"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."

519
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:06,360
- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.

520
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,980
James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,

521
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,310
defender of the so-called faith.

522
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:14,860
Oh, please, James, put it away.

523
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,700
It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.

524
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,240
Yes.

525
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:30,000
- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.

526
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,630
How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?

527
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,380
Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.

528
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,840
We're both orphans, James.

529
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:46,180
But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,

530
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,730
mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.

531
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:55,060
But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.

532
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,370
MI6 figured I was too young to remember.

533
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,530
And in one of life's little ironies,

534
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,910
the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal

535
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,700
caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.

536
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:15,170
Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.

537
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,220
It wasn't God who gave me this face.

538
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,970
It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.

539
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:27,430
- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.

540
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,440
By the WHY

541
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,700
I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew

542
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,770
007's loyalty was always
to the mission,

543
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,990
never to his friend.

544
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,750
Closing time, James. Last call.

545
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,760
For England, James.

546
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:08,260
Wake up! Mister!

547
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:13,180
Wake up, please! Wake up!

548
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,270
I'm here. I'm here!

549
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,400
Hurry! Hurry up! Come on!

550
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,440
Pull yourself together or we're gonna die!

551
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:28,740
- Do something! Get us out of here!
- I'm a little tied up!

552
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,410
Never mind.

553
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,700
The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.

554
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:55,990
Here. Let me help you.

555
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,700
That's it. Mind your head.

556
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,640
Let me... go!

557
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:54,180
Who are you?

558
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,680
- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.

559
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,770
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

560
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:04,150
Look, they might be back any minute.

561
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:08,070
Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?

562
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,950
I've never been to Severnaya.

563
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,370
Your watch has. Frozen
by the Golden Eye blast.

564
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:19,000
And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.

565
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:23,370
- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.

566
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,960
The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.

567
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,220
- But I don't know anything!
- Then start with what you do know.

568
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,640
My name is Natalya Simonova.

569
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,940
I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...

570
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,110
Go on.

571
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,650
- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?

572
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:58,240
- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?

573
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,660
Boris. Boris Grishenko.

574
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:04,670
- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.

575
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:08,000
- There was no one else?
- No.

576
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:13,090
They're going to kill me, aren't they?

577
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,970
Trust me.

578
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,970
Trust you? I don't even know your name.

579
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:25,690
Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.

580
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,860
I am Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin.

581
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:39,370
So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?

582
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,540
What, no small talk?

583
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,740
No chitchat?

584
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,460
That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.

585
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,460
- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humor doesn't slay me.

586
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,130
- Where is the Golden Eye?
- I assumed you had it.

587
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,850
I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...

588
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,520
- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?

589
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,320
- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.

590
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:10,650
- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it.

591
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:13,230
You're like... boys with toys.

592
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,750
It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.

593
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:24,130
I saw him do it.

594
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,960
- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.

595
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,580
He killed everyone,
then stole the GoldenEye.

596
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,050
And why would he do that?

597
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,800
There is another satellite.

598
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,180
Another Golden Eye.

599
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:48,850
Thank you, Miss Simonova.

600
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,400
What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?

601
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:58,230
Defense Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.

602
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,490
- You are out of order.
- Molcheech. Molcheeta!

603
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:05,580
From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.

604
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:08,040
I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.

605
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:12,420
<i>- Put it down, General!
- Do you even know who the enemy is?</i>

606
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,380
- Do you?
- Guard!

607
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,510
Defense Minister Dimitri Mishkin,

608
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:28,650
murdered by
British agent James Bond,

609
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:34,740
himself shot while trying to escape.

610
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,320
Guards!

611
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,250
Come on!

612
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:31,040
They're in the archive!

613
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:37,470
Down!

614
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:31,390
Spread out!
Cover the other side!

615
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:33,600
Trust me.

616
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,400
Argh!

617
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,230
Go now!

618
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,800
Faster!

619
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:06,030
Damn it.

620
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,830
Down the alley!

621
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,390
Use the bumper. That's what it's for.

622
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:30,530
Nazad!

623
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,620
What was that?

624
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,110
Go left!

625
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,490
Get out!

626
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:13,340
Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.

627
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:16,290
Mishkin got to them before I could.

628
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,930
Bond is alive?

629
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,760
- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.

630
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,560
Bad for you.

631
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,150
Take a seat, my dear.

632
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:50,830
You know, James and I
shared everything.

633
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,210
Absolutely everything.

634
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,470
To the victor go the spoils.

635
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:13,060
You'll like it where we're going.

636
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,900
You may even learn to like me.

637
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,450
- Svinya!

638
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:33,410
Stay with her.

639
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,420
Bond. Only Bond.

640
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,600
He's going to derail us.

641
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,520
- Full speed!
- Sure?

642
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,390
Full speed! Ram him!

643
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,440
Bye-bye.

644
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:58,700
Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?

645
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:00,420
You first.

646
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,590
You... second.

647
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,220
Up!

648
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:12,140
Situation analysis... hopeless.

649
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:16,310
You have no backup, no escape route.

650
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,360
And I have the only bargaining chip.

651
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,020
- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.

652
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:28,190
Ourumov, bring her in.

653
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,780
Lovely girl.

654
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,490
Tastes like... like strawberries.

655
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,620
- I wouldn't know.
- I would.

656
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,050
So, back where we started, James.

657
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:51,970
Your friend, or the mission?

658
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:54,720
Drop the gun. I'll let her live.

659
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,860
Ourumov... what has
this Cossack promised you?

660
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,320
You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.

661
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,200
- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you! Just like everyone else.

662
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:15,360
- Ls this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours,

663
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:18,580
you and I will have
more money than God

664
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:22,250
and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service,

665
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:26,760
with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.

666
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,090
So, what's the choice, James?

667
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:35,270
Two targets, time enough for one shot.

668
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,890
The girl, or the mission?

669
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:40,940
Kill her. She means nothing to me.

670
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,860
See you in hell, James.

671
01:30:57,070 --> 01:31:01,700
- One-inch Armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!

672
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,800
Boris. Yes!

673
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,510
- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.

674
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:16,930
If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.

675
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,560
- Don't stand there! Get us out of here!
- Yes, sir.

676
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,830
Good luck with the floor, James.

677
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:46,660
I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.

678
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:50,170
It was the least I could do for a friend.

679
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:55,590
- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.

680
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,670
- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?

681
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,850
Boris' password. He plays word games
"What I sit on but don't take with me."

682
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,890
- Chair.
- Like I said...

683
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:44,350
30 seconds.

684
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:48,060
He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,

685
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:51,270
- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,

686
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:53,320
- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds!

687
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,740
Mexico City, Rio, Miami...

688
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:05,660
- Come on!
- Wait! He's in Cuba. Havana - no.

689
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:08,250
NOW!

690
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:31,030
Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?

691
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,820
Standard operating procedure.

692
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,450
Boys with toys.

693
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:44,070
Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.

694
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,620
Our trip?

695
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:50,000
Do you know how to disarm the weapon?

696
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:55,500
I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.

697
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:03,810
So... tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures

698
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:06,760
I should be aware of, Commander?

699
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,690
Thousands.

700
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:16,320
But I only pay them

701
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,950
lip service.

702
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,510
My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.

703
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,840
It's so beautiful.

704
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:50,180
Not another human being in sight.

705
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,110
What is it with you and moving vehicles?

706
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:36,140
Yo, Jimbo! Brought a little gift
from old... whatshisname? T? Z?

707
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:37,770
<i>_</i> Q_
- Yeah.

708
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:41,610
- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.

709
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:45,320
Uh... lam not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.

710
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,080
Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.

711
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,780
Mm-hm. Yes, I do.

712
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,580
Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.

713
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,170
The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.

714
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,920
You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.

715
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,340
Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.

716
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:05,260
- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.

717
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,890
- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.

718
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,020
- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.

719
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:16,650
Did you check her out?

720
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,150
- Head to toe.
- Right...

721
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,700
So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football? eld, huh? Doesn't exist.

722
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:29,370
- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.

723
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:34,200
It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.

724
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:37,120
I've never been there.
How does she know about that?

725
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,460
- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.

726
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,970
Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.

727
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:47,710
- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade!

728
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:55,310
Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.

729
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,810
- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.

730
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,320
Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.

731
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:06,610
He knows you're comin'.

732
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:11,010
He was your friend - Trevelyan.

733
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,890
And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.

734
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,850
It is that simple?

735
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,110
In a word, yes.

736
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,570
- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...

737
01:38:26,650 --> 01:38:31,570
You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?

738
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:34,450
So you can be a hero?

739
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,000
- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...

740
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,290
How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?

741
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:46,090
It's what keeps me alive.

742
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:50,380
No. It's what keeps you alone.

743
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,840
James...

744
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:35,470
Yes?

745
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:43,600
On the train,

746
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:49,480
when you told him to kill me
and that I meant nothing to you,

747
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,270
did you mean it?

748
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:54,780
Yes.

749
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:59,610
Always call their bluff.

750
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,960
No.

751
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:43,280
Turn ten degrees south, bearing 1-8-4.

752
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:45,290
Yes, sir.

753
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:13,530
Nothing. There is nothing here.

754
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:16,240
Let's make another pass.

755
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,500
Maybe Wade was right. There is no dish.

756
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,810
Natalya.

757
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:36,790
This time, Mr Bond,
the pleasure will be all mine.

758
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,190
You wait for your turn.

759
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,020
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.

760
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:49,030
- Ls the satellite in range?
- Six minutes.

761
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,830
- Prepare the dish.
- No. It's too early.

762
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,420
- I am not ready.
- Do it.

763
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:28,650
No wonder we couldn't see it.

764
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,840
Come on.

765
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,690
The world's greatest cash card.

766
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:01,730
It had better not be rejected.

767
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:09,590
- Mischa is on-line.
- Sir!

768
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:16,680
Kill him.

769
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,260
The man just won't take a hint.

770
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:20,690
Hm!

771
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:24,730
- Target coordinates?
- The target is London.

772
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:40,330
He's getting ready to signal the satellite.

773
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:43,340
- How do you stop it?
- The transmitter above the antenna.

774
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:18,280
Antenna in position.

775
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:23,000
On my count.

776
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:26,500
Three... two... one.

777
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:57,740
God save the Queen.

778
01:49:16,710 --> 01:49:20,090
- The mainframe computer.
- Don't move.

779
01:50:46,550 --> 01:50:49,770
James! What an unpleasant surprise.

780
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:53,020
- We aim to please.
- Where's the girl?

781
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:55,820
Find her!

782
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,990
So, how is old Q?

783
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:07,870
Up to his usual tricks?

784
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,790
The watch.

785
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,920
Ah. A new model.

786
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:19,390
Still press here, do I?

787
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:38,530
Interesting setup, Alec.

788
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,690
You break into the Bank of England
via computer,

789
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:44,320
then transfer the money electronically

790
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:47,700
just seconds before
you set off the GoldenEye,

791
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:51,120
which erases any record
of the transactions.

792
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:54,540
- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.

793
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:57,590
But it still boils down to petty theft.

794
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:02,800
In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.

795
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:15,770
You always did have
a small mind, James.

796
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:21,560
It's not just erasing bank records. It's
everything on every computer in London.

797
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:26,450
Tax records, the stock market,
credit ratings, land registries,

798
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:28,700
criminal records.

799
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:33,000
In 16 minutes and 43... no, 42 seconds,

800
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:35,840
the United Kingdom
will re-enter the Stone Age.

801
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:38,920
A worldwide financial meltdown.

802
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:43,220
And all so mad little Alec can settle
a score with the world 50 years on.

803
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:47,890
Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud.
I might <i>as</i> well ask you

804
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:52,560
if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.

805
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:59,440
Or if you find forgiveness
in the arms of all those willing women

806
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,980
for all the dead ones
you failed to protect.

807
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:07,690
England is about to learn
the cost of betrayal,

808
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,660
inflation-adjusted for 1945.

809
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,780
- Welcome to the party, my dear.
- Natalya!

810
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:54,160
Don't ever... do that again.

811
01:53:54,490 --> 01:53:57,910
This is not one of your games, Boris.
Real people will die!

812
01:53:57,990 --> 01:54:01,040
You pathetic little worm.

813
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,170
She was in the mainframe.
Check the computer.

814
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:08,350
She's a moron.
A second-level programmer.

815
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,850
She works on the guidance system.

816
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:15,470
She doesn't even have access
to the? ring codes.

817
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:21,860
Retro-rockets firing.

818
01:54:39,870 --> 01:54:45,630
- What the hell's happening?
- We will have re-entry in... 12 minutes.

819
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,710
It will burn up
somewhere over the Atlantic.

820
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,770
- Deal with it!
- She changed the access codes!

821
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,720
Then she can fix it.

822
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,230
Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.

823
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,700
I can do it! I can break her codes!

824
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:11,280
Then get on with it!

825
01:55:38,970 --> 01:55:41,140
Tell him! Now!

826
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,060
Give me the codes, Natalya!
Give them to me!

827
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:03,540
- Can Boris break your codes?
- Possibly.

828
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,710
Possibly?

829
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:09,050
We have to destroy the transmitter.

830
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:12,300
By the way, I'm fine,
thank you very much!

831
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:44,080
Do you know how to use one of these?

832
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:47,500
Yes.

833
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,830
Good. Stay out of sight.

834
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,560
- How long?
- Two minutes.

835
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,230
- One minute.
- Guard!

836
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:12,150
- I'm fixing it.
- If he moves, kill him.

837
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:38,070
Yes! I am invincible.

838
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:50,240
You know, James?

839
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:53,370
I was always better.

840
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,720
Alpha One to Gunship.

841
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:15,140
<i>Alpha One to Gunship!</i>

842
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:18,120
Speak to me!

843
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,290
For England, James?

844
02:02:55,910 --> 02:02:56,950
No.

845
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,580
For me.

846
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,670
Aaargh!

847
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,130
Aaargh!

848
02:03:54,630 --> 02:03:56,220
Aaargh!

849
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,620
Yes! I am invincible!

850
02:04:46,430 --> 02:04:47,980
James! James!

851
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:50,440
Are you all right?

852
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:55,980
Yes, I'm? Ne. Thank you.

853
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:08,330
Suppose someone is watching?

854
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,380
There's no one within 25 miles,
believe me.

855
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,550
Yo, Jimbo!

856
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:29,190
Is this supposed to be your idea
of "coming through in a clinch"?

857
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:32,560
It's tobacco plants.

858
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:35,070
I said I'd be here, huh?

859
02:05:35,150 --> 02:05:36,530
Yo! Marines!

860
02:05:47,580 --> 02:05:51,050
Maybe you would like to finish debriefing
each other at Guantanamo, hm?

861
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,920
- Ready?
- I'm not going on a helicopter with you.

862
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,350
No plane, no train, nothing that moves.

863
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:02,350
Darling, what could
possibly go wrong, hey?

864
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:41,670
<i>I know you dream a lot</i>

865
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:47,270
<i>Holding on to lies</i>

866
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:52,610
<i>And you wait around</i>

867
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:59,990
<i>For someone to know where you hide</i>

868
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:06,700
<i>And in your dreams you feel a lot</i>

869
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:12,420
<i>Though you keep it all inside</i>

870
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,840
<i>And you close your eyes</i>

871
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:24,470
<i>It helps keep you alive</i>

872
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:30,730
<i>And the experience of lovin'</i>

873
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:36,360
<i>Will take all the pain away</i>

874
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:43,280
<i>Just understanding for the first time</i>

875
02:07:44,150 --> 02:07:46,660
<i>What you feel inside</i>

876
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:50,000
<i>When love is in your life</i>

877
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:55,880
<i>Leave your dreams behind</i>

878
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:04,310
<i>Breathin' in the scent of love</i>

879
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:08,430
<i>Leave your dreams behind</i>

880
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:18,020
<i>Sensing life in everything under the sky</i>

881
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:33,540
<i>And the experience of lovin'</i>

882
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:39,330
<i>Will take all the pain away</i>

883
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:46,590
<i>Just understanding for the first time</i>

884
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,260
<i>What you feel inside</i>

885
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:52,810
<i>When love is in your life</i>

886
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:01,820
The experience of love

887
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:08,370
<i>Under the sky</i>

888
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:10,490
<i>Sensing life</i>

889
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:14,030
The experience of love

890
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:17,920
<i>For the first time</i>

891
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,500
<i>Under the sky</i>

892
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:23,180
<i>Will take all the pain away</i>

893
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:26,430
The experience of love

894
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:33,220
<i>Under the sky</i>

895
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:36,020
<i>When love is in your life</i>

896
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:39,850
The experience of love

897
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,190
<i>Take it now, feel the glow</i>

898
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,950
<i>Hold it close, don't let it go</i>
