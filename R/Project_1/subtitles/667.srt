Ladies, you can't go.

13
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,053
What about Jimmy?
What about the show?

14
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:49,186
Marty, you know I can talk.
Now watch me walk.

15
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,490
Sugar, Jimmy was just being Jimmy.

16
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,161
You know he's crazy about you.
Just crazy.

17
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,408
Oh, really?

18
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,832
Well, give the crazy man
a message from me.

19
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,456
Tell him I got his number.
His phone number.

00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,245
Now, baby...

21
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:14,833
At home, where he lives, with his wife.

22
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:18,341
Come on, Joann.
Our limousine is waiting.

23
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,798
We don't have to put up with this shit.

24
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,303

Hey, mister.

Thanks, man.

29
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,985
Can I interest you
in the sound of tomorrow?

30
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,739
Oh, my God. We're too late.

31
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:47,573
Excuse me?

32
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,372
Hey. You go on yet?

33
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,506
About an hour ago.

38
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:15,064
The unstoppable Stepp Sisters!

43
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:34,792
Mercy. Mercy, mercy. Ladies? Ladies?
I've got the break of your lives.

44
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,545
The great Jimmy Early is looking
for some backup help tonight...

45
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,798
Now / want you to turn it on
for Little Albert and the Tru-Tones!

46
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:48,434
Me and my baby goin’ downtown

47
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,058
Me and my baby gettin’ down tonight

00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:55,062
-Me and my baby goin’ downtown

00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:58,941
Me and my baby gonna
check, check, check out the sights

50
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,866
We ’re looking around

51
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,441
On the town with my sweet lady

52
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,616
Looking around

53
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,911
Oh, we’re gonna have us a time tonight

54
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,198
Checking it over

55
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:11,499
Checking it out

56
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,326
Checking it over

57
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,036
Checking it out

58
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:26,056
-l'm so sorry, Mr...
-Taylor. Curtis Taylor, Jr.

59
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,975
Look, I know we're late, but my mama
don't like me going out on weeknights.

60
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,974
So I had to wait for her to go to bed.
She's a grade-school teacher.

61
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,271
Who are you?

62
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:37,317
Deena Jones!
I'm one of The Dreamettes.

63
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,189
You were supposed to go on second.

64
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,276
I know, but my mama wouldn't
go to bed, so I couldn't go out.

65
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,820
Hey, tough luck, kid. The show's over.

66
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,492
Let me lay something on you
right quick, brother.

67
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,910
Check it out, man.

68
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,076
Look, I know you're a great man
and you're the boss with all the ladies,

69
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,668
so I don't want you
coming up weak in here,

70
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,368
but low-rating people, that's not
why you're in this business, right?

71
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,498
No!

72
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,083
That's good, so why don't we
give these girls a break tonight?

73
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,972
Okay, I'll put you on last.

74
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,590
-Right after Tiny Joe Dixon.
-Thank you.

75
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,846
Excuse me, which one is Tiny?

76
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,268
We ’re going downtown

77
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:23,605
Check out the sights

78
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,781
Okay, we’re going to get down and dirty
with my man, Mr. Tiny Joe Dixon!

79
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:42,045
Baby, I’m takin’ the long way home

80
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:46,420
’Cause my baby don ’t live there no more

81
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,380
I got the music to the drummer.

82
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,931
C.C., we're on next.

83
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,350
-Where is Effie?
-l'm right here.

84
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:56,979
God, I need to rest.
Where's our dressing room?

85
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,683
Effie, there's no time for that.
We go on in two minutes.

86
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:01,894
-What?
-Come on, let's warm up.

87
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:02,977
Move, move...

88
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,663
We're ruined unless
we can find new wigs.

89
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,460
Why do we need wigs in the first place?

90
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,247
Because we need a look.

91
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:26,005
-I got it! Turn the wigs around.
-What?

92
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,553
No, really.
Come on, turn the wigs around.

93
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:35,765
Oh, Deena, it's so different.

94
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,686
It's sophisticated looking. Come on!

95
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:45,941
Frontways or backways,
store-bought hair ain't natural.

96
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,114
And what about these dresses?

97
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:52,614
I mean, this dress does nothing
for my body.

98
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:54,745
-You got the same wig I got?
-Yeah.

99
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:57,370
-You got the same dress I got?
-Yeah.

100
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,041
Then shut up.

101
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:08,543
Say, Miss?

102
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,508
I think you look just great.

103
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,552
She left with all her clothes

104
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,729
Her bedroom in a mess

105
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:26,816
/ don ’t know why she went away
’cause I gave her all my best

106
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,028
Baby, I’m takin’ the long way home

107
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:36,405
’Cause my baby don ’t live there no more

108
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,746
-What's the name of your group again?
-The Dreamettes.

109
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:44,086
Nice, baby.

110
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,205
Yeah.

111
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:09,479
Let’s hear it for Mr. Tiny Joe Dixon!

112
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:15,035
And now for our ﬁnal act of the evening,
the courageous, the curvaceous,

113
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,577
Creamettes!

114
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,205
It's The Dreamettesl The Dreamettesl

115
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,866
Move, move

116
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,462
Move right out of my life

117
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,120
Move, move

118
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,882
Move right out of my life

119
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,415
You better move

120
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,505
You’re steppin’ on my heart

121
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,632
I said, move

122
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:35,338
You’re tearin’ it apart

123
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,889
Please move

124
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,262
Oh, what am I gonna do?

125
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:40,935
My heart

126
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:45,561
ls breakin’, breakin’ up over you

127
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,484
You’ve got such magnetic power

128
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,813
That just keeps holding me down

129
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,824
/ feel just like a flower

130
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,196
That you’re keeping stuck

131
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,073
in the ground, ground, ground

132
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:01,031
Move, move
Move right out of my life

133
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:02,491
Move it, move it

134
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,995
Out of my life

135
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,412
Move right out of my life

136
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,542
Move it, move it

137
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,668
Out of my life

138
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,590
Move, move

139
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:14,590
Move right out of my life

140
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,513
You are so horribly satanic

141
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,182
The way you lead me around

142
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,345
/ feel just like the Titanic

143
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:27,061
I’m always going down

144
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,311
Move, move

145
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,519
You’re steppin’ on my style

146
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,444
You’re steppin’ on my style
Yes, you are

147
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:34,022
I said, move, move

148
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,485
I want to breathe for a while

149
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,369
Hey, baby

150
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,289
Get out of my life

151
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,753
There ’s too much pain and strife

152
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,127
So why don ’t you pack it up
and move it?

153
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:53,549
Take the cat, kit and caboodle

154
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,137
Take your broken-down car

155
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,427
Your smelly cigar

156
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:58,300
And just move right out of my

157
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:02,930
Move right out of my life

158
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,578
Come on! Come on! You can do better!

159
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:26,408
Let’s hear it for the delectable,
deﬁant Dreamettes!

160
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:43,133
Hey, Mister. Five dimes
say The Dreamettes don't win.

161
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,308
You got it.
They weren't going to win anyway.

162
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:50,974
Now remember,
the winner of this year’s contest gets

163
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:54,778
a week’s paid engagement right here
at the famous Detroit Theater.

164
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:58,114
All right now.

165
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,244
And that very lucky,
very talented star of tomorrow is

166
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,491
Mr. Tiny Joe Dixon!

167
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,172
Does this mean
we're not going to be famous now?

168
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,676
Well, not tonight.

169
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,554
Come on, let's go home.

170
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,468
VVhy?

171
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,100
Because I'm tired
and I got to get up early for work.

172
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,102
I mean, what's the point?

173
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,314
Lorrell, how old were we
when we first started singing together?

174
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,776
Twelve.

175
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,152
And C.C., how many dances
you got dreamed up for us?

176
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,950
How many songs written there
in your notebook?

177
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,486
I don't know. Maybe a hundred.

178
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:49,578
And, Effie, have you ever met anyone
who could sing as crazy as you?

179
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,158
No.

180
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,335
And still we get nowhere?

181
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,668
So I'm asking you, what's the point?

182
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,458
The point is you don't need
an amateur contest,

183
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,215
because there's nothing
amateur about you.

184
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:04,638
What you need is a break,
and I'm here to give it to you.

185
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,684
Thirty bucks each
to sing behind Mr. Jimmy Early tonight.

186
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,563
Jimmy Early?

187
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,854
And a guaranteed 10-week
engagement on the road

188
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,603
starting tomorrow morning
at $400 a week.

189
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,101
-$400?
-Yes.

190
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,686
-You swear?
-If I'm lying, I'm dying.

191
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,776
By the way, Mr. Early said
he'd hire my Aunt Ethel

192
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,653
to watch after you gals
while you're away from home.

193
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,692
Mama's going to love that!

194
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:26,448
Effie, do you hear this?

195
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:29,246
We're singing behind
Jimmy Early tonight!

196
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,665
-I don't do backup.
-Come on, girl.

197
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,960
All we got to do is just sing
a few "oohs" and "aahs."

198
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,174
I don't do "oohs" and "aahs."

199
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,956
Now, you look, Effie.

200
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:44,842
-This could be our big break.
-Singing backup is a trap.

201
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:49,639
Now, I'm sorry, Mister,
but we cannot accept your offer.

202
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,969
All right, all right, all right.

203
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,804
Look, I know you're good.

204
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,274
And you know you're good, too.
And very talented.

205
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,483
And not only that,
you are a stone cold fox.

206
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,231
But that ain't enough.

207
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,276
A girl like you can get hurt out there
if you ain't got somebody protecting you.

208
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,452
Now, I'm here to do that for you, baby.
But you got to believe me.

209
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,915
You got to trust in me.

210
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,244
I ain't gonna disappoint you.

211
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,496
-Come on, Effie? What do you say?
-Come on, Effie.

212
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,756
-Well, Mr...
-Curtis Taylor, Jr.

213
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:25,925
Curtis Taylor, Jr., our manager,

214
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:30,721
says we're singing behind
Mr. Jimmy Early tonight!

215
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,096
Oh, baby, I love you!

216
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:35,605
This business sure has got
a lot of ups and downs!

217
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,522
Are you ready for the Thunder Man?

218
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:45,649
and he ain't coming up
unless he can hear you!

219
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:48,489
Let's hit it, boys. Showtime.

220
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,821
Hey, Marty, I said no mayonnaise, man.
How many times I got to tell you?

221
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,702
No mayonnaise
on the chicken sandwich!

222
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:55,783
We got bigger problems, baby.

223
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,834
I warned you to lay off
the women that you work with.

224
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,330
There's plenty other ladies out there.

225
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,880
Well, who got time
to go out and find them, Marty?

226
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:03,253
I'm always working, baby.

227
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,507
Yeah, 'cause Marty always
keeps you working.

228
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,756
Hell, yeah. That's why I keep letting you
give me the wrong sandwich.

229
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,930
Let's go get this money now.

230
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,594
-ls everything set?
-Yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.

231
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,055
This is a group.
It's either three or nothing.

232
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,650
Hey, man, who is this guy?

233
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,144
My clients always work together.

234
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,319
I know you.
Didn't you sell me my Cadillac?

235
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:25,897
Yeah, yeah. In addition to
my management company,

236
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,732
l have a Cadillac dealership
on Woodward Avenue.

237
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,570
Yeah, well, my kitty needs a tune-up.
And Jimmy only works with two, baby.

238
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,529
Sorry, brother, it's two or nothing.

239
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,750
Those the girls right there?

240
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:48,924
I think three is gonna work outjust fine.

241
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,849
Ladies!

242
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,385
Ladies. Ladies, thank you so much.
You're saving Jimmy's life.

243
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,470
Thank you so much, ladies.
I'm at your feet.

244
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,272
You see that? I'm at your feet, baby.
Thank you so much.

245
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:04,193
And I'd do anything for y'all. Anything.
You hear what I'm saying? Anything.

246
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:07,821
Exactly what would you like
Jimmy to do for you, baby?

247
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,193
Well, Mr. Early,

248
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,368
you could teach us the song.

249
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,376
Thirteen years

250
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:26,124
of solid gold platters

251
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,385
Rising costs

252
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:35,300
And cocktail chatter

253
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,479
Fat deejays

254
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,653
Stereophonic sound

255
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,937
on, baby

256
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,988
The game of hits

257
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:55,574
Goes round and around

258
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,288
But you can fake your way to the top

259
00:15:58,376 --> 00:15:59,616
Round and around

260
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,166
Try that part right there, baby.

261
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,333
Round and around

262
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,161
Fake your way to the top

263
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,211
Round and around

264
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,585
Yeah, you fell right in there,
didn't you, sweetheart?

265
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,633
You can fake your way to the top

266
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,926
Round and around

267
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,095
Shit, I knew you'd have it.

268
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,723
But it’s always real, so real

269
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,392
Always so real

270
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,390
When you’re coming down

271
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,852
Yeah, yeah, been around

272
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,150
Oh, / know what’s happening

273
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,603
I’ve been around

274
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,409
Faking my way

275
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,120
Through every town

276
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,571
I’ve made my living

277
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,616
Off of my sound

278
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,625
And the game of hits

279
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,506
It goes around and around
and around and around

280
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,083
Around and around
and around and around

281
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,916
A man gets lonely

282
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,494
Workin’ hard on the road

283
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,466
He’s away from his woman

284
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,958
It’s a heavy load

285
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:55,570
That back there is Harlem.
This is Hollywood.

286
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,034
And you ain't welcome in Hollywood.

287
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,038
A man needs help

288
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,749
Tryin’ to make it all alone

289
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,672
He has a part-time baby

290
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,337
So he won ’t be alone

291
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,010
So he won ’t be alone

292
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,563
Time to bring up the lights!

293
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:40,285
Yeah, let’s see which one of these girls
is going home with Jimmy tonight?

294
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,655
I got a nice, warm bed waiting on you.

295
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,951
Jimmy, my bed.

296
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:51,204
All right now. Come on now.
Who wants to sit on Daddy’s lap?

297
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,544
Yeah!

298
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,715
Is your man here?

299
00:18:56,471 --> 00:18:58,632
What? He’s in the bathroom?

300
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:01,555
Hey, somebody go up there
and lock that bathroom up.

301
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:04,471
Well, / don ’t wanna get in no trouble
up in here tonight.

302
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,846
My bed, with my bad self.

303
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,977
Come on! Break it down.

304
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:31,919
Make me feel so real

305
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,166
Feel so real

306
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:34,880
Feel so real

307
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,252
Feel so real

308
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:37,675
Don ’t it feel so real?

309
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,174
Yeah, it feels real

310
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,134
Yeah

311
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:50,559
I don't believe
all this all can be happening to me.

312
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,687
Miracles happen all the time
in the world of R&B, baby.

313
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,898
-What's R&B mean?
-Rough and black.

314
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:04,285
Mr. Early, you're so crazy.

315
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:06,533
Call me Jimmy, baby. Jimmy.

316
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:12,369
Oh, Mr. Jimmy. You're so crazy.

317
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:19,296
That does feel nice.
I mean, it feels funny.

318
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,218
You're married, aren't you?

319
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,305
Everybody say yeah

320
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:25,472
Yeah

321
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,970
Say yeah

322
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:28,551
Yeah

323
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,978
Everybody knows
Jimmy's married, baby.

324
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,685
Then...

325
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:39,066
Then you get your married hands off!

326
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,414
So it's gonna take two weeks.

327
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,254
/ faked my way to the top

328
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,626
Round and around

329
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:00,174
Oh, yeah

330
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,626
Round and around

331
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,257
/ faked my way to the top

332
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,678
Round and around

333
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:07,597
Round and around

334
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:09,926
You know / faked my way to the top

335
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:11,010
Round and around

336
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,974
It’s always real, so real

337
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,312
When you’re coming down

338
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:25,275
/ faked my way, yes, I did

339
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,622
Help me, Jesus

340
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,167
Help, help, help me, Jesus

341
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:42,292
/ faked my way to the top

342
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:55,479
Did you notice
the seats are periwinkle blue

343
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,182
to go along with
your pretty blue dress? And...

344
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:02,148
-Would you excuse me?
-Certainly.

345
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,026
Wayne? Help me out.

346
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,565
Hi.

347
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,196
How can I help you today?

348
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:12,823
Here. This is our periwinkle blue.
Matches your dress.

349
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,728
I'm just saying, you might do better
if you were just a little more, you know...

350
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,027
-Shy? Sugar-sweet, like you?
-Boys seem to like it.

351
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:46,239
Well, I am not interested
in boys, Deena.

352
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:47,691
What are you ladies jawing about?

353
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:51,028
Well, Curtis, we were just wondering...

354
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,869
Do you cheat on your wife,
like Mr. Jimmy Early?

355
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,538
Hey, Effie! I don't know her.

356
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,877
Deena's right.
It's really none of our business.

357
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:04,832
We don't even know if you're married.

358
00:23:04,928 --> 00:23:07,214
l was married. It didn't work out.

359
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:13,175
Well, was she one of those teeny little
tweety-birds like little Miss Deena here?

360
00:23:13,937 --> 00:23:15,973
Or do you prefer a real woman?

361
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:18,271
Well, actually, lwas raised
by my older sisters,

362
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,269
and they were just as real as you are.

363
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:23,310
Well, why don't you sit down
and tell me about them?

364
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:26,612
You know, lwould love to,
but give me a minute.

365
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,159
It ain't working, Marty.
That faint used to kill 'em.

366
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:41,165
-It used to slay 'em in the aisles.
-Slay 'em in the aisles, baby.

367
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,462
But now you got everybody doing it.

368
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,413
You got Otis, J.B.
Everybody doing my shit.

369
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:45,961
You're right, Jimmy.
Everybody's doing it.

370
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:47,132
Well, who's the original?

371
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,801
Who was the first one to fall down
and start screaming?

372
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:50,048
-That was you.
-l'm the first!

373
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:53,131
And you killed 'em tonight, baby.
It was beautiful, Jimmy. Beautiful.

374
00:23:53,226 --> 00:23:55,091
Marty, you're full of shit, man.
I need something.

375
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,268
Man, I need something...

376
00:23:57,355 --> 00:23:59,266
That's what I need.
Sweet Mother Jesus.

377
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:01,723
I need that right there!

378
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:03,982
What you need is a new sound.

379
00:24:04,696 --> 00:24:08,029
What I need is a new Caddy.
That one you sold me is dripping oil.

380
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:13,572
Hey, Jimmy, you remember C.C.,
Effie's brother?

381
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:15,153
He's a very talented composer.

382
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:17,534
Yeah, I remember you.
You wrote that song, Move On.

383
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,126
Move.
The girls be, "Move, move, move."

384
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,541
Yeah, that was me, man.

385
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,244
-All right.
-Yeah.

386
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:25,038
What did you think of that song, Marty?

387
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:29,254
Well, I think it was kind of...

388
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,015
You know...

389
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:39,599
-Kind of boring, I thought.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

390
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:41,638
It's boring, kid.

391
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,598
I'm no kid, mister.

392
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,399
I'm sorry, baby,
but when Jimmy's involved,

393
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,276
the song got to have some soul!

394
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,457
Damn! Lord have mercy!

395
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:03,660
Got to have soul!

396
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:08,836
Soul, gospel, R&B, jazz, blues,

397
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,303
everything else the man
has grabbed from us.

398
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,218
Listen, there's got to be a better way
for us to get our music

399
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:14,341
to a broader audience,

400
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:17,469
only this time
with our artists and our money.

401
00:25:18,144 --> 00:25:20,226
Marty, this man is handing me
a line of crap.

402
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,928
Yeah, I know, baby.

403
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:26,521
Got me a Cadillac
Cadillac, Cadillac

404
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:29,780
Got me a Cadillac car

405
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:35,491
Got me a Cadillac
Cadillac, Cadillac

406
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:39,283
Look at me, mister, I’m a star

407
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,291
I know what you cats are trying to do,
and you can forget it.

408
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:51,125
James Early ain't no street-corner punk
looking for his first date.

409
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:55,095
He's an established artist
with a recording contract.

410
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:57,763
On a shitty local label
that can't get him to the pop charts.

411
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,181
We can't do nothing about that.

412
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:02,396
All I'm asking is one record, man.
One song with a simple hook.

413
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,597
"Look at me in my pretty car,
makes me feel like a movie star."

414
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,433
You know where all the hits
happen these days? In cars, man.

415
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:11,270
Songs that make you feel good
while you're driving your automobile.

416
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,022
Yeah?

417
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:17,696
Jimmy's fans like taking the bus.

418
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,448
Let's hit it, Jimmy.

419
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:26,167
Hey, what do you think about
using that bridge there, baby?

420
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,873
Movin’ out

421
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:33,674
Mo vin’ up

422
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:35,134
Mo vin’ on

423
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,427
Sounds a little tick-tock, boys.

424
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:37,762
Let's stay in the pocket.

425
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:40,511
Going to work! Shut it down!

426
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:43,217
Recording, Cadillac Car. Take nine.

427
00:26:43,563 --> 00:26:46,430
I got me a Cadillac

428
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,060
Cadillac, Cadillac

429
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:50,642
I got me a Cadillac car

430
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,019
Got me a Cadillac

431
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,445
Cadillac, Cadillac

432
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:56,443
Look at me, mister, I’m a star

433
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,234
I’m on the move

434
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,318
I’m gettin’ on

435
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:03,488
l’m breakin’ out

436
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,244
And it won ’t take long

437
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:06,915
Behind the wheel

438
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:08,334
Got a song

439
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:09,831
Pedal’s down

440
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,504
And I’m gone

441
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,509
We ’ve got that coming up
in the next hour,

442
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,679
but for now,
let me get a hold of your ear.

443
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,680
It's a different sound
for the Thunder Man.

444
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,428
And I think you're gonna enjoy it.

445
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:27,261
Got me a Cadillac

446
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:28,937
Cadillac, Cadillac

447
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:30,606
Oh, my God, Lorrell!
Do you hear that? That's us!

448
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,437
We're on the radio, Curtis!

449
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,522
-What's happening?
-Black station, the signal's too weak.

450
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:38,857
Turn this boat around! Hurry up!

451
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,112
C.C., fix it! What are you waiting for?

452
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,952
Antenna's up

453
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,280
Top is down

454
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,872
Peelin’ out

455
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,369
Don ’t care where I’m bound

456
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:50,042
Got these four wheels

457
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:51,505
Spinnin’ round

458
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:53,295
Me and my two-tone Caddy

459
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,044
Gonna blow this town

460
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:57,636
Movin’ out

461
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:02,305
Cadillac Caris No. 8 on the R&B charts,
and No. 98 on the pop charts.

462
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:03,722
Movin’ out

463
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:05,258
Mo vin’ up

464
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:06,342
Mo vin’ on

465
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:24,485
Right to the top

466
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,260
Got me a Cadillac

467
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,592
Cadillac, Cadillac

468
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:51,228
Got me a Cadillac car

469
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:54,391
Oh, I’ve got me a Cadillac

470
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,897
Cadillac, Cadillac

471
00:28:56,987 --> 00:29:01,321
Look at me, mister, I’m a star

472
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:06,069
Look at me, mister, I’m a star

473
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:09,822
Look at me, mister

474
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:16,125
I’m a star

475
00:29:21,971 --> 00:29:24,007
That’s Dave & the Sweethearts
with their marvelous

476
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,259
new recording, Cadillac Car.

477
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:45,525
You hear this shit?

478
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,285
You hear this shit?

479
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,279
They act like we don't even exist!

480
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,040
Is that how it works, Curtis?

481
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:55,163
The man decides he wants something,
he just takes it?

482
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,373
I mean, how can they do that?
That's my song.

483
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,834
Our song.

484
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,337
Marty says this happens all the time.
Once something...

485
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,134
That's bullshit, man!
He should have protected us!

486
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,424
They stole our hit.

487
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:07,963
I never thought...

488
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,892
You got me to think for you now

489
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,936
I’ve tried to make good

490
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:18,312
Without much success

491
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:22,520
You’ve got me to think for you now

492
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:25,573
Every time / try for more

493
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,447
/ wind up with less

494
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:37,419
You gotta put your soul
on a moral break

495
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,041
Get to the point

496
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,123
You just gotta

497
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:50,256
take

498
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:52,466
Who was the first artist
to sing Hound Dog?

499
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:53,843
Elvis Presley.

500
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:57,973
Big Mama Thornton. She had
the No. 1 single on the R&B charts,

501
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,227
but white stations wouldn't play it

502
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,104
because to them it was
just another race record.

503
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:06,106
We are gonna make friends with the
most important deejays in this country.

504
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,862
It's strictly pay-for-play with those boys.

505
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:10,864
That takes money. Real money.

506
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,698
What is that? Chicken scratch?

507
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:17,586
Let's get to work.

508
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,581
Steppin' to the bad side

509
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:24,294
Gonna take a mean ride

510
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,928
The smile / had is gone away

511
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:31,381
Those that steal are gonna pay

512
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:37,311
Steppin' to the bad side today

513
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,648
I’m telling you now, it’s got to end

514
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,521
No more trusting them, my friend

515
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:44,101
Change our style

516
00:31:44,197 --> 00:31:45,357
Change our tone

517
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:47,446
Make the songs we sing our own

518
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:50,115
Steppin' to the bad side

519
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:54,411
Gonna take a mean ride

520
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:59,455
I’ll get you all the breaks you need

521
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:01,661
In just two years, we’ll be in the lead

522
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,997
Can’t sit back, it’s plain to see

523
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,298
Open your eyes and trust in me

524
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,592
Steppin' to the bad side

525
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:13,218
Gonna take a mean ride

526
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,011
l was a man who tried to be good

527
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,312
l was always misunderstood

528
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,388
You can’t play fair or be too meek

529
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:23,853
You gotta get way down

530
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:26,321
and show your danger streak

531
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:30,523
Steppin' to the bad side

532
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:33,826
Here's a great new song
from Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes.

533
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:36,279
Gonna take a mean ride

534
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,534
...a new hit from Jimmy Early
and The Dreamettes.

535
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,961
It's called Steppin' to the Bad Side.

536
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:19,747
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
to the Apollo Theater’s legendary stage

537
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,994
Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes,

538
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:25,499
singing their No. 1 hit,
Steppin' to the Bad Side.

539
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,249
Steppin' to the bad side

540
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:32,426
Steppin' to the bad side

541
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,253
Steppin' to the bad side

542
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,764
Steppin' to the bad side

543
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,932
Steppin' to the bad side

544
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,180
Steppin' to the bad side

545
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:43,308
Steppin' to the bad side

546
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:45,515
Steppin' to the bad side

547
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,270
Steppin' to the bad side

548
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,144
I had to step into the bad side

549
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,614
I had to take myself a mean ride

550
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,827
You know that smile I had is gone away

551
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:01,371
Those that steal are gonna pay

552
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:05,201
Steppin' to the bad side today

553
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,419
A man just stole my woman from me

554
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,538
He took her down to Tennessee

555
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,756
She was the best girl / ever knew

556
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:14,381
If it wasn’t for him, she’d still be true

557
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,386
Always been a good man, it’s been said

558
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:18,715
When / catch the man
He’ll wish he was dead

559
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:21,019
Men like him make good men mad

560
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:24,721
Starting today I’m gonna be bad

561
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,648
l’m steppin’ to the bad side

562
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,403
l have to take myself a mean ride

563
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:37,691
You know that smile I had is gone away

564
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,163
Those that steal are gonna pay

565
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:42,283
Steppin' to the bad side

566
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,365
Steppin' to the bad side

567
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,916
Steppin' to the bad side

568
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:51,043
Steppin' to the bad side today

569
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,630
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

570
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,336
Step on to the bad side

571
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:59,717
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

572
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,969
Steppin' to the bad side

573
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:05,553
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

574
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,062
Step, step

575
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,107
Steppin' to the bad side

576
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:14,403
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

577
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:22,407
-Step on
-Step on to the bad side

578
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:23,908
Step on to the bad side

579
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:32,497
Step on up to the bad side

580
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:39,212
Got to step to the bad side

581
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:48,270
The motor is now cranked up

582
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,518
and we are moving up
the highway of freedom

583
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,600
toward the city of equality.

584
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:56,107
And we can’t afford to stop now,

585
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:59,531
because our nation
has a date with destiny.

586
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,449
We must keep moving.

587
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:05,074
l have a dream this afternoon

588
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,914
that one day right here in Detroit,

589
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:12,253
Negroes will be able to buy a house

590
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:14,751
anywhere that their money
will carry them,

591
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,083
and they will be able to get a job.

592
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:21,428
Made my peach cobbler!

593
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:23,763
Curtis!

594
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:27,218
-Hey, baby, you know my sisters.
-Tell me something.

595
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,769
Do you think it's right to promote
an amateur performer

596
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,347
over a professional?

597
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,102
I don't know what this is about.

598
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:36,435
It's about fairness, Curtis.
It's about people paying their dues.

599
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:41,024
Ain't that what you keep telling me?
"Get in line, Effie. Wait your turn."

600
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:46,699
So why am I sitting here without
so much as a B-side on the 45

601
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,703
when an amateur like
Martin Luther King, Jr.

602
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,202
gets his own freakin' album?

603
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,629
I mean, can he even sing?

604
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:09,969
All right, that was a good one.

605
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,262
You're a great man, Curtis.

606
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,273
Isn't your brother a great man?

607
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,622
Never met a man

608
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,834
Quite like you

609
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,713
Doin’ all he can

610
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:43,086
Makin’ my dreams come true

611
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,423
You’re strong and you’re smart

612
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,383
You’ve taken my heart

613
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:53,187
And I’ll give you the rest of me, too

614
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:56,682
You’re the perfect man for me

615
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:59,314
llove you, I do

616
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,151
llove you

617
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,329
Hold it, hold it. I promise
I'll get to all of you in a minute,

618
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,627
but right now I need
someone that can type.

619
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,454
Anybody got some
secretarial experience?

620
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,256
-I can do it.
-You? Come on.

621
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,801
What's all this?

622
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,217
All right, come in.

623
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,138
/ never felt

624
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,647
Quite like this

625
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:40,142
Good about myself

626
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:45,026
From my very ﬁrst kiss

627
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,650
I’m here when you call

628
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,952
You’ve got it all

629
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:54,448
And conﬁdence like / never knew

630
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,039
You’re the perfect man for me

631
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,087
llove you, I do

632
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,375
You’ve got the charm

633
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,962
You simply disarm me every time

634
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:13,099
As long as you drive

635
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:17,350
l’m along for the ride your way

636
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,771
You said it before

637
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,602
There won ’t be a door

638
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:26,234
That’s closed to us

639
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:30,950
l’m puttin’ all my trust in you

640
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:37,492
’Cause you, you’ll always be true

641
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,542
/ never could have known

642
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:43,709
This would be

643
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,672
You and you alone

644
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,472
All for me

645
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,726
/ know you’re the best

646
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,769
You’ve passed every test

647
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:02,975
It’s almost too good to be true

648
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,982
You’re the perfect man for me

649
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,234
llove you, I do

650
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:16,243
You’re the perfect man for me

651
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:21,961
llove you, I do

652
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,351
C.C. wrote it for me.

653
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:37,176
What do you think, Curtis?

654
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,930
It's too light.
We want light, but not that light.

655
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:42,105
Not that light?

656
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:44,400
Okay, but when we fix it,
you're gonna put it in the show, right?

657
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:45,476
First things first.

658
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,606
I got to get Jimmy booked
down in Miami,

659
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,562
even if I got to buy my own hotel.

660
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:51,239
But you promised I wouldn't spend
my life singing backup, Curtis.

661
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:52,316
And I still promise that.

662
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,743
I'm not gonna let this beautiful voice
go to waste.

663
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:58,531
You just got to trust me.

664
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:02,001
-Can we talk about it more tonight?
-All night.

665
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,756
-All right.
-Bye, man.

666
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:09,758
All right.

667
00:41:10,346 --> 00:41:12,177
Boy, you're a real snake.

668
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,051
A cheap, second-rate hustler.
Street-corner con artist.

669
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,884
Look, you want to buy a car, Marty?
Why don't we talk about it in my office?

670
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:20,014
I'm away a week,
and you cancel dates behind my back.

671
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,642
I spent six months
setting up this tour for Jimmy.

672
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,439
Jimmy's too big for
that Chitlin Circuit shit.

673
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:26,108
I'm trying to get him booked
at the Paradise in Miami.

674
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,980
-Miami?
-Miami.

675
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:29,733
You're really drifting out there, chump.

676
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,696
You couldn't get Sammy Davis, Jr.
in there.

677
00:41:32,076 --> 00:41:34,783
That place is so white, they
don't even let our boys park the cars.

678
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:37,324
I got him an audition.

679
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:41,824
-Luck, man. Hustler's luck.
-That's just the beginning.

680
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,830
Then we're gonna do the Copa,
the Americana.

681
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,206
He could even do American Bandstand.

682
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:46,912
I've been in this business
too many years

683
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:50,670
-to listen to some hotshot talk bullshit.
-Not bullshit, Marty. Change.

684
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:54,128
I'm talking change. Can't you see?
The time is now.

685
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:57,841
Jimmy needs a new act, something
classier, with a catchier sound.

686
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,471
That'll go down better with white folks.

687
00:41:59,562 --> 00:42:00,642
That'll put him where he should be,

688
00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:02,344
making the type of money
he should be making.

689
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:05,272
He's at the top of the pop charts.
He's hot.

690
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,653
-We can do this for him.
-We?

691
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:13,943
-Yeah, we.
-We do nothing.

692
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,193
Jimmy's mine, so back off, Curtis.
Jimmy's mine.

693
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:18,653
Jimmy don't belong to no one.

694
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,615
Are you defending
this car salesman, Jimmy?

695
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,825
Can't you see he's using you?

696
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,582
Ain't nobody using Jimmy, all right?
Nobody.

697
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:30,627
Who do you think you're
talking to, baby? It's Marty.

698
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:34,131
The man who found you singing for
pennies when you were 10 years old.

699
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,054
It's a whole new day, Marty,
and a brand new Jimmy.

700
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,315
You want him, brother? You got him.

701
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,102
I'm through.

702
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:51,061
-Hey, what you doing?
-You can't have it all, baby.

703
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:53,146
Hey, come on, Marty, don't go.
I want you to stay.

704
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,029
I love you, Jimmy.

705
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:01,867
But you can't have it all.

706
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,217
Lady, you got to be Jewish.
Of course, yeah, of course.

707
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:18,421
It’s 105 degrees in here, and you’re
the only one wearing a mink stole.

708
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:19,925
Hey, my friend, what’s your nationality?

709
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,599
"Nationality. " / know it’s a big word.
What are you, Cuban?

710
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,935
Of course. You’re Cuban.
You’re Cuban, I’m a Jew.

711
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,728
You know, lsay this
from the bottom of my heart.

712
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,352
A Negro, if he had enough money,
could move into my neighborhood.

713
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,683
You, not a chance.

714
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,436
Tonight, though,
we ’re here to make history.

715
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:38,149
The ﬁrst Negro headliners
to ever play Miami Beach.

716
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:39,529
What do you think of that?

717
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,076
Come on.
It’s a very convenient arrangement.

718
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,654
These are good people.
/ mean, they can sing, they can dance,

719
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:46,240
they can even mop up aften/vards.
You can’t ﬁnd help like that.

720
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:52,333
Anyway, please give a warm round
of applause to the very talented

721
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:54,585
Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes!
Come on!

722
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:08,346
/ want you, baby

723
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:12,187
/ want you

724
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,855
And / need you, baby

725
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:18,530
/ need you

726
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:20,486
on, baby

727
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,158
Baby

728
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,362
You got me on my knees

729
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:26,993
Got me on my knees

730
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:29,200
You got me begging

731
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,583
Baby, baby

732
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,207
Baby, baby

733
00:44:36,302 --> 00:44:41,888
Baby, please

734
00:44:44,435 --> 00:44:46,426
/ know you don ’t trust

735
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:49,599
the way / feel

736
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:54,691
You know, we can always create
a younger look for American Bandstand.

737
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:55,767
Yeah.

738
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,529
You got me on my knees

739
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:07,200
You got me beggin’

740
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,533
Baby, baby

741
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,619
Baby, baby

742
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:19,799
Oh, yeah

743
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,475
Oh, / want you, baby

744
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:32,725
And / need you, baby

745
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,397
Yes, I do

746
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:37,101
/ want you

747
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:42,569
Baby, you got me, baby

748
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,911
Now I’m yours, baby

749
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:02,125
Yes!

750
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,603
I love me some Jimmy, but he's
gonna have to stop calling me "baby."

751
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:17,773
I'm a woman now.

752
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,362
Did you see the man
Curtis was sitting with?

753
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:23,447
Did you hear what I said, Deena?
I am a woman now.

754
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:25,946
-Lorrell, I know.
-What do you mean, you know?

755
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:29,073
-Has Jimmy talked?
-He didn't have to.

756
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:31,371
How could you?
Come on, you're just a baby, Lorrell.

757
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:35,326
I am not, Deena. I'm a woman now.
I'm 18, so I'm a woman.

758
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:37,707
Yeah, she's a mature woman, like me,

759
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:40,414
and she loves Jimmy
just as much as I love Curtis.

760
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:44,252
-lt's not wrong when you love someone.
-ls that all you two can think about?

761
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:45,715
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

762
00:46:46,056 --> 00:46:48,092
Well, there's no doubt
my mama brought me up fit.

763
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:52,309
-Deena, you're just jealous.
-Let yourself go just once.

764
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:55,805
It's so wonderful
to have somebody to love.

765
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,434
-You ladies decent?
-Well, I am.

766
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,941
-I can't speak for these two.
-Hey, babe.

767
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:07,942
Curtis, how did it go
with American Bandstand?

768
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,196
Timing's not right.

769
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:11,825
Well, maybe they'll be more
interested after we play the Copa.

770
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,289
-Y'all ain't playing the Copa.
-What?

771
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:17,125
I'm breaking you and Jimmy up.

772
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:19,127
I know what you're doing, Curtis!

773
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:20,670
You're breaking us up 'cause
you don't want me with Jimmy.

774
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,372
None of you do!
Because you're all jealous!

775
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,008
Well, nothing's breaking me
and Jimmy up! Nothing!

776
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,884
I'm breaking you up because
Jimmy is going back out on the road,

777
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:31,681
while you stay here
and open your own act.

778
00:47:32,478 --> 00:47:33,684
Did you say our own act?

779
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:37,771
Finally, Curtis! This is what
I've been waiting for. I love you.

780
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:40,603
Oh, well, honey, I'm fine with that.
I mean, I love me some Jimmy,

781
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:42,605
but I don't want to be singing
behind him the rest of my life.

782
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:45,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting The Dreams.

783
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,151
The Dreamettes were little girls.
You're women now.

784
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:49,358
-You see, Deena, I told you!
-We open in a week,

785
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,694
so we got a lot of work to do.
We're gonna have a lot of changes.

786
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,325
I'm bringing on Jolly Jenkins
to stage a whole new show.

787
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:57,328
He's done movies, Broadway,
clubs acts, you name it.

788
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,206
New wigs, the expensive kind.

789
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:02,788
Brand-new costumes
to appeal to a younger crowd.

790
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:04,874
And...

791
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,667
Effie?

792
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:11,380
-Deena's going to sing lead.
-Deena's doing what?

793
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:14,807
-Lead.
-What do you mean?

794
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:19,138
-I always sing lead. Tell him, C.C.
-We're trying something new, Effie.

795
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:24,860
-You knew about this?
-Curtis and I talked it over.

796
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:26,778
He said it's only temporary.

797
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:30,114
We finally get the chance
to have our own act

798
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:31,783
and Deena's doing lead?

799
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,451
She can't sing like I can.

800
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,536
She's right, Curtis. I can't.

801
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,156
I don't want to.

802
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:43,124
Now, y'all gonna do what I tell you to do.
This is a new sound with a new look.

803
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:45,957
New look?
Nobody can see her on a record!

804
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,922
The only way we'll be able to change
things is by appealing to kids,

805
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:51,048
and kids today watch television.

806
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:54,427
So Deena's going to sing in the lead
'cause you like the way she looks?

807
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:01,772
Am I ugly to you, Curtis?

808
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:05,225
Baby, come on. You know
how I feel about you. Come on.

809
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:10,276
-Don't make it personal.
-Well, what am I supposed to do?

810
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,608
Deena's beautiful and she's
always been beautiful!

811
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,410
But I've got the voice, Curtis!
I've got the voice!

812
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,237
You can't put me in back! You just can't!

813
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,791
Well, you'll be singing backup with me.
What's so wrong with that?

814
00:49:20,877 --> 00:49:22,833
Let Deena do all the work for a change.

815
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:24,422
Your voice alone is too special.

816
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:27,669
We need a lighter sound
to cross over to the pop charts.

817
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:28,874
It's what we need.

818
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:36,261
What about what I need?

819
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:39,551
Curtis says it's the
best thing for the group.

820
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:44,732
What about what’s best for me?

821
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,558
He feels The Dreams can cross over.

822
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:51,150
What about how / feel?

823
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,746
Effie, do it for me.

824
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:03,371
What about me?

825
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:08,421
What about me?

826
00:50:11,928 --> 00:50:17,594
It’s more than you

827
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:22,269
It is more than me

828
00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:25,555
No matter what we are

829
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:29,275
We are a family

830
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:34,232
This dream is for all of us

831
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:38,618
This one can be real

832
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:43,407
And you can’t stop us now

833
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:47,540
Because of how you feel

834
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:51,294
It’s more than you

835
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:56,550
It is more than me

836
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:59,760
Whatever dreams we have

837
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:04,053
They’re for the family

838
00:51:05,023 --> 00:51:07,639
We’re not alone anymore

839
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:12,649
Now there are others there

840
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,612
And that dream is big enough

841
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:21,654
For all of us to share

842
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,239
So don ’t think you’re going

843
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:28,122
You’re not going anywhere

844
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:32,422
You’re staying and taking your share

845
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:36,172
And if you get afraid again

846
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:40,346
I’ll be there

847
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:42,971
We are a family

848
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,723
Like a giant tree

849
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,931
Branching out toward the sky

850
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:51,562
We are a family

851
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:54,986
We are so much more

852
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,530
Than just you and l

853
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,903
We are a family

854
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,281
Like a giant tree

855
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:07,116
Growing stronger, growing wiser

856
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:12,421
We are growing

857
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,832
free

858
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:18,384
We need you

859
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:27,562
We are a family

860
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,408
Ladies and gentlemen,

861
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,244
the Crystal Room is proud to present

862
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:54,706
the club debut of America ’s newest
recording stars, The Dreams!

863
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,762
Every man has his own special dream

864
00:53:06,853 --> 00:53:10,391
And your dream’s
just about to come true

865
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,064
Life’s not as bad as it may seem

866
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:14,687
If you open your eyes

867
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:17,770
To what’s in front of you

868
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:19,859
We ’re your dream girls

869
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,283
Boys, we’ll make you happy

870
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,450
Yeah

871
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:26,620
We ’re your dream girls

872
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:31,040
Boys, we’ll always care

873
00:53:31,127 --> 00:53:33,288
We ’re your dream girls

874
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,713
Dream girls will never leave you

875
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,210
No, no

Boys, we 7/ always...

889
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:19,297
I'm amazed, Mr. Taylor.
Much as I love my daughter,

890
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,420
I never thought
she had much of a voice.

891
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:24,469
Deena has something better.
She has a quality.

892
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:28,932
-You make her sound like a product.
-Product. I like that.

893
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:32,719
We’ll be there.

894
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:35,976

00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,528

Your dream girl can only
make love to you

900
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:55,458
I’m not the dream that you had before

901
00:54:55,795 --> 00:55:01,506
I’m the dream that will give you
more and more

902

00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,515
Just dream, baby

920
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,769
We 7/ be there

921
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:59,519
We 7/ be there

922
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:03,026
We will be there

923
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,269
We 7/ be there

924
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:32,297
Who was the first one
to wear shiny clothes?

925
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:36,017
-Little Richard.
-That was me, baby! I started that.

926
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:38,516
You remember that burgundyjacket
I had with the bolt lightning on the back?

927
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:41,473
Lightning was in glitter.
Glitter's shiny, baby.

928
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,067
-Hey, Jimmy.
-...Deena Jones and The Dreams.

929
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:45,901
Rumors at Abbey Road say

930
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:48,571
George Martin is keen to work with
the talented trio.

931
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:50,740
Could they be ready to record
with the Fab Four?

932
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:53,034
Well, the boys will just have to wait.

933
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:55,783
These girls are busy
blazing a trail across the globe.

934
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,331
People ask me
how I came up with the sound.

935
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:07,844
I tell them it's like
making a great sundae.

936
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:10,385
You start outwith two scoops
of ice cream, some sauce,

937
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:13,589
-and then you put a cherry on top.
-And is Deena the cherry?

938
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:19,519
Why, Miss Jones is the cherry,
the nuts, the sauce, the cream

939
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:22,439
-and the banana, too.
-Miss Jones, right here.

940
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:36,036
We look on with shock and dismay at
the images we ’re bringing you tonight.

941
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:41,243
Detroit under siege and in flames
as rioters and looters storm the city.

942
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:44,294
President Johnson has declared
a state of emergency.

943
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:48,420
You used to be so light and free

944
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,343
You used to smile just looking at me

945
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:54,926
Now all you give is jealous hate

946
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:56,177
Come on, baby

947
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:58,133
Better lose some weight

948
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:00,560
Heavy, heavy

949
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:03,764
You got so heavy, baby

950
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:05,974
Stop!

951
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,983
Effie, what's going on?
You are still too loud.

952
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:13,816
-I'm trying, Curtis.
-If you don't ease up, I'll do it for you.

953
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:14,991
Maybe we should
just come back in the morning.

954
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:17,569
You know we can't.
The album's already a month late.

955
00:58:17,664 --> 00:58:19,529
Look, I know you're tired.
You're tired, right?

956
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,740
-Can Ijust get one more?
-Okay.

957
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,335
All right? Okay.

958
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:24,201
Let's get it right.

959
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:35,258
Record Heavy, Heavy. Take 30.

960
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,299
Heavy, heavy

961
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:42,477
You got so heavy, baby

962
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,602
Heavy, heavy

963
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:49,731
You got so heavy on me

964
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,190
-Where do you think you're going?
-You're a liar, Curtis.

965
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:56,274
You'd better watch your mouth.

966
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,861
You're sleeping with her
and everyone knows!

967
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,865
Hey, hey, hey, don't go out there!

968
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:09,458
Burn it up!

969
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,256
-We're black-owned!
-Yeah!

970
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,965
-You all right?
-I don't feel well, Curtis.

971
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:23,018
CBS’s Star Cavalcade
presents the incredible Dreams

972
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:25,471
singing their latest hit, Heavy, Heavy.

973
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:29,023
You got so heavy, baby

974
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:31,727
Heavy, heavy

975
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:34,734
You got so heavy on me

976
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:38,950
You used to want nothing from me

977
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:42,659
You used to say, "Let’s both be free"

978
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:44,580
You used to dance instead of walk

979
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:48,081
-Tighten up on camera two. Tighten up.
-Move in, camera two.

980
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:50,750
Heavy, heavy

981
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:53,256
You got so heavy, baby

982
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,753
Talk, talk, talk

983
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:56,676
Heavy, heavy

984
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:58,014
Talk, talk, talk

985
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:01,761
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy

986
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:10,266
Heavy, heavy

987
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:13,359
You got so heavy, baby

988
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:14,527
Yeah, yeah

989
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,363
Heavy, heavy

990
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,533
You got so heavy on me

991
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:33,539
Effie, you're going crazy!
Tell me, what have I done?

992
01:00:33,633 --> 01:00:36,215
You stole my dream, Deena,
and you stole my man!

993
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:37,713
I don't want to hear that kind of talk
out of you...

994
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,635
Don't act like you don't know
what this is about!

995
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,213
Effie, stop screaming.
Everybody can hear you.

996
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,798
I don't care! Let them all hear!

997
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:45,885
I'm warning you, Effie, you stop
bringing us down! And get back there!

998
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:50,188
Why, Curtis? You don't need me.
All you care about is her bony ass!

999
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:51,685
You better back off.

1000
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:54,813
Or what?

1001
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:00,732
I didn't think so.

1002
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:11,035
Love, love me, baby

1003
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,374
Love, love me, chi/d

1004
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,300
’Cause, baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me wild

1005
01:01:18,386 --> 01:01:20,672
Listen, listen, listen.
The mirrors got to turn together, guys.

1006
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:22,091
They got to dance.

1007
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:25,883
Mr. Taylor? We have
a bigger problem on our hands.

1008
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,719
Do I have to remind you
that it's New Year's Eve?

1009
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,645
Burt, don't worry about it.
I've got it taken care of.

1010
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:34,725
These people are paying 50 bucks.
They expect to see three girls.

1011
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:36,234
Trust me.

1012
01:01:39,115 --> 01:01:42,573
-Curtis, I just don't feel right about this.
-It's done.

1013
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,091
Wardrobe needs you first.

1014
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:10,434
We are a family

1015
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:12,478
Like a giant tree

1016
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,977
Branching out toward the sky

1017
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,480
We are a family

1018
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:23,106
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-Effie.

1019
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,275
C.C., sorry I missed rehearsals.

1020
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,036
But I went to the doctor,
and I am feeling much better now.

1021
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:29,445
Look, don't try to make it tonight.

1022
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:31,949
What are you talking about, baby?
It's New Year's Eve.

1023
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:33,783
Yeah.
Curtis just stepped out to make a call.

1024
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:37,045
Why don't you go up to your room
and later he'll come up and talk to you?

1025
01:02:37,632 --> 01:02:39,293
I said, I'm fine.

1026
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:43,085
Excuse me. I have to get dressed now.

1027
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,380
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

1028
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:50,467
I got all the steps down,
but those harmonies...

1029
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,805
C.C., what's going on?

1030
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:57,941
Lorrell, what's going on?

1031
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:01,315
-Effie, Curtis was supposed to...
-Love me.

1032
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:05,573
Curtis was supposed to love me.

1033
01:03:07,037 --> 01:03:10,074
There you are, Effie.
I've been looking all over.

1034
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:14,033
/ turn my back and ﬁnd myself
out on the line

1035
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:15,583
You could have warned me

1036
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,332
But that would have been too kind

1037
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:21,540
I've been warning you for months
to clean up your act.

1038
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:23,250
You've been late, you've been mean,

1039
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:25,301
giving all kinds of bullshit flack.

1040
01:03:25,388 --> 01:03:28,050
That’s a lie, that’s a lie

1041
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:31,724
It’s just I haven ’t been feeling that well

1042
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:32,800
Effie, please!

1043
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:34,136
Stop excusing yourself.

1044
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,640
You've been late, you've been mean,

1045
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:37,268
and getting fatter all the time.

1046
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:38,940
Now, you’re lyin’, lyin’

1047
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,437
I’ve never been so thin!

1048
01:03:40,528 --> 01:03:41,984
You’re lyin’, you’re lyin’

1049
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:45,779
Who thinks she’s better than everybody

1050
01:03:45,867 --> 01:03:47,903
She ain't better than anybody!

1051
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:49,700
She’s nothing but common!

1052
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,278
Now, who you calling common

1053
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:55,833
You self-indulgent, self-absorbed,
non-professional?

1054
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,035
You! I’m calling you

1055
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:01,709
I’m calling you the common piece
he’s knocking off

1056
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,587
Now, you listen to me
Miss Blame It On The World

1057
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:07,420
See, I’ve put up with you
for much too long

1058
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:09,550
l have put up with your bitching

1059
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,222
I’ve put up with your nagging

1060
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:13,971
And all your screaming, too

1061
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:18,476
Now, when are you two gonna stop
all this ﬁghting?

1062
01:04:18,566 --> 01:04:19,817
Stay out of this, Lorrell.

1063
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:21,107
This is between Deena and me.

1064
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:23,059
Yeah? Well, it’s between me, too!

1065
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:26,021
I’m as much a part of this group
as anybody else

1066
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:29,324
And I’m tired, Efﬁe, I’m tired

1067
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,777
of all the problems you’re making us

1068
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:34,203
/ always knew you two were together

1069
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,325
What?

1070
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:37,658
/ always knew you two
were ganging up on me!

1071
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:40,459
She had nothing to do with this change

1072
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:42,037
It was you, it was you

1073
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:44,248
Always thinking of you!

1074
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:47,713
Always thinking of you!

1075
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:49,419
/ knew you were trouble from the start

1076
01:04:49,514 --> 01:04:50,503
Trouble?

1077
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:52,850
You were real bad trouble from the start

1078
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:54,094
Curtis, I'm your woman.

1079
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:55,174
But you’re getting out now

1080
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,852
I’m not building this group
to have you tear it apart

1081
01:04:57,939 --> 01:05:01,227
Go ahead and rant and scream
and shout!

1082
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:04,855
Don’t worry, baby, I’ll buy you out

1083
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,278
There's no money
dirty enough to buy me out.

1084
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:08,946
You remember that, Curtis.

1085
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:10,989
Lay off, Efﬁe

1086
01:05:11,494 --> 01:05:12,950
Just take the money and run

1087
01:05:13,037 --> 01:05:14,573
You're in this with him, C.C.?

1088
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:16,950
Cool it, Efﬁe

1089
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:19,157
This time you know what you done

1090
01:05:19,252 --> 01:05:20,958
So they bought
your black ass, too, huh?

1091
01:05:21,045 --> 01:05:23,297
I said, cool it, Efﬁe

1092
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:25,247
This time you’ve gone too far

1093
01:05:25,341 --> 01:05:27,252
Oh, I can go further! I can go further!

1094
01:05:27,343 --> 01:05:30,426
I don ’t want to stay around this

1095
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:33,756
I’m just breakin’ into this business

1096
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,557
This is between all of you

1097
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,887
-This is none of my affair
-Yeah?

1098
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:42,267
Well, it’s between you, too
Now, little sister

1099
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,021
This snow job is as much your sin

1100
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:48,023
Look at me! Look at me!

1101
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:50,901
How much did you put out to get in?

1102
01:05:50,992 --> 01:05:54,484
Now, you watch your mouth
Watch your mouth, Miss Efﬁe White

1103
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:58,743
’Cause I don ’t take that talk
from no second-rate diva

1104
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,334
who can’t sustain

1105
01:06:00,418 --> 01:06:03,785
I’m not feeling well, I’ve got pain

1106
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,838
Efﬁe, we all got pain!

1107
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:10,918
For seven years, I’ve sung with you
/ was your sister

1108
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:12,923
You were our trouble

1109
01:06:13,014 --> 01:06:18,179
And now you’re telling me it’s all over

1110
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:24,560
And now we’re telling you it’s all over

1111
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:29,068
And now I’m telling you / ain’t going

1112
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:30,691
It’s all over

1113
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:32,272
/ ain’t going

1114
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:35,859
It’s all over

1115
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:48,213
And / am telling you

1116
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:52,175
I’m not going

1117
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:58,306
You’re the best man I’ll ever know

1118
01:06:58,393 --> 01:07:02,477
There’s no way I can ever go

1119
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:05,180
No, no, there’s no way

1120
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:09,769
No, no, no way I’m living without you

1121
01:07:11,072 --> 01:07:14,860
I’m not living without you

1122
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:20,363
I don ’t want to be free

1123
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:24,245
I’m staying, I’m staying

1124
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:27,126
And you, and you

1125
01:07:27,797 --> 01:07:31,756
You’re gonna love me

1126
01:07:36,055 --> 01:07:40,048
You’re gonna love me

1127
01:07:44,272 --> 01:07:48,265
And / am telling you

1128
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:52,018
I’m not going

1129
01:07:52,113 --> 01:07:56,152
Even though the rough times
are showing

1130
01:07:56,242 --> 01:08:01,578
There’s just no way, there’s no way

1131
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:04,747
We’re part of the same place

1132
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:08,952
We’re part of the same time

1133
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:13,169
We both share the same blood

1134
01:08:13,843 --> 01:08:17,176
We both have the same mind

1135
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:23,384
And time and time
We’ve had so much to share

1136
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,515
No, no, no, no, no, no way

1137
01:08:26,606 --> 01:08:29,723
I’m not waking up tomorrow morning

1138
01:08:29,817 --> 01:08:34,982
And ﬁnding that there’s nobody there

1139
01:08:35,073 --> 01:08:37,485
Darling, there’s no way

1140
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:43,240
No, no, no, no way
I’m living without you

1141
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:46,073
I’m not living without you

1142
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:49,409
You see, there’s just no way

1143
01:08:49,504 --> 01:08:52,291
There’s no way

1144
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:55,874
Please don ’t go away from me

1145
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:59,632
Stay with me, stay with me

1146
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:03,176
Stay, stay and hold me

1147
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:06,430
Stay, stay and hold me

1148
01:09:07,855 --> 01:09:11,723
Please stay and hold me, Mister Man

1149
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:15,060
Try it, mister, try it, mister

1150
01:09:15,154 --> 01:09:18,817
/ know you can

1151
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:24,319
Tear down the mountain

1152
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:27,781
Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want

1153
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:29,745
I’m not walking out

1154
01:09:30,837 --> 01:09:33,829
Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill

1155
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:36,084
I’m not gonna leave you

1156
01:09:36,175 --> 01:09:42,842
There’s no way / will

1157
01:09:43,933 --> 01:09:50,600
And / am telling you

1158
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:55,559
I’m not going

1159
01:09:55,903 --> 01:09:59,987
You’re the best man I’ll ever know

1160
01:10:00,074 --> 01:10:03,532
There’s no way I could ever, ever go

1161
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:06,201
No, no, no, no way

1162
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:08,405
No, no, no, no way

1163
01:10:08,499 --> 01:10:11,662
I’m living without you

1164
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:13,914
I’m not living without you

1165
01:10:14,005 --> 01:10:16,496
Not living without you

1166
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:20,504
I don ’t want to be free

1167
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:23,883
I’m staying, I’m staying

1168
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:27,181
And you, and you, and you

1169
01:10:27,268 --> 01:10:30,431
You’re gonna love me

1170
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:38,189
You’re gonna love me

1171
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:41,771
Yes, you are
Yes, you are

1172
01:10:44,827 --> 01:10:45,862
Love me!

1173
01:10:46,871 --> 01:10:47,906
Love me!

1174
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:50,412
Love me!

1175
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:57,625
Love

1176
01:11:01,427 --> 01:11:08,094
You’re gonna love

1177
01:11:12,855 --> 01:11:19,522
me

1178
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:26,449
Ladies and gentlemen, the showroom
at Caesar’s Palace is proud to present

1179
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:28,902
Deena Jones and The Dreams.

1180
01:11:28,996 --> 01:11:31,328
Love, love me, baby

1181
01:11:31,415 --> 01:11:33,497
Love, love me, chi/d

1182
01:11:34,085 --> 01:11:40,627
’Cause baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me wild

1183
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:53,343
l’m somebody, somebody

1184
01:11:53,437 --> 01:11:55,974
And nobody’s gonna hold me down

1185
01:11:56,065 --> 01:12:00,354
No, nobody, nobody, nobody’s
gonna hold me down

1186
01:12:01,904 --> 01:12:03,064
l’m somebody

1187
01:12:03,281 --> 01:12:05,818
It all started on the streets of Detroit,

1188
01:12:05,908 --> 01:12:09,492
where three girls named
Deena, Lorre/l and Michelle

1189
01:12:09,579 --> 01:12:13,788
dreamed about one day
becoming singing stars.

1190
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,287
Since their triumphant Las Vegas debut,

1191
01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:20,336
they’ve had No. 1 albums
for each of the last six years.

1192
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:24,416
And they’re showing no signs
of slowing down anytime soon.

1193
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,752
But for Deena Jones,
none of these exciting events compare

1194
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:31,681
to the day she
became Mrs. Curtis Taylor, Jr.

1195
01:12:32,768 --> 01:12:36,636
With his wife at his side,
Mr. Taylor has built his music empire

1196
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:41,191
into the most successful Afro-American
business in the United States,

1197
01:12:41,277 --> 01:12:45,566
producing such sensations
as The Family Funk,

1198
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:46,941
Jimmy Ear/y,

1199
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,866
and the phenomenal
Campbell Connection.

1200
01:12:50,411 --> 01:12:54,245
Deena Jones has conquered
the worlds of music and television.

1201
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:58,041
And soon, she hopes to take on
her biggest challenge yet,

1202
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:02,120
the epic, untold story
of Cleopatra ’s early years

1203
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:04,922
all set to the music of today.

1204
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:11,930
No, nobody, nobody, nobody’s
gonna hold me down

1205
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:13,678
l’m somebody

1206
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:26,652
Thank you.

1207
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:32,529
Now, I saved the bad news
for last, Curtis.

1208
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:36,579
Paramount passed on Cleopatra.

1209
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,408
VVhy?

1210
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:42,118
Too period.

1211
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,960
And they're not convinced
Deena's got the chops.

1212
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,175
Fuck it.

1213
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:54,472
We'll finance the movie ourselves.

1214
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,182
I just don't know
how you're going to swing it.

1215
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,347
You're spreading yourself
too thin as it is.

1216
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:00,558
The music side is starting to suffer.

1217
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:03,015
-Music runs itself.
-Those days are over, Curtis.

1218
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,771
Just putting Deena's name on a record
don't make it a hit anymore.

1219
01:14:05,987 --> 01:14:08,148
And our acts are dying on the road.
Especially Jimmy.

1220
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,734
-He needs new material.
-No, Jimmy needs to sober up.

1221
01:14:10,992 --> 01:14:13,199
Wayne, start pitching the networks
on the anniversary special.

1222
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:14,321
We'll do a greatest hits tie-in.

1223
01:14:14,412 --> 01:14:15,868
We'll rake in enough green
to make 10 movies,

1224
01:14:15,955 --> 01:14:18,412
and pay for all of you
useless motherfuckers.

1225
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:20,573
Have a good day.

1226
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:27,915
-How's my beautiful wife?
-Curtis.

1227
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:32,419
-I'm not sure how to tell you this.
-Tell me what? Just say it.

1228
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:34,926
I know how much time
you've invested in this movie.

1229
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,437
But I can't play that part.

1230
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:42,433
I promised you I was gonna
make you a movie star, right?

1231
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:44,230
Cleopatra is gonna get us there.

1232
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:47,355
I mean, this is the queen of a nation,
not some hooker, junkie, maid.

1233
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:49,687
I know. I know.
It's a very important story.

1234
01:14:49,782 --> 01:14:50,942
And it's more than you.

1235
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:53,698
Think about all the beautiful black
women that ain't even born yet.

1236
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:56,360
When they grow up they're gonna say,
"I can play any part I want to.

1237
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,571
"Look at Deena Jones. She did it."

1238
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:00,951
But it's ridiculous. Come on.

1239
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,125
She's 16 years old
for most of the movie.

1240
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,627
Well, baby, you'll always be 16 to me.

1241
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:08,626
Maybe that's the problem.

1242
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:11,716
Maybe you just don't see me
for who I am.

1243
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:19,720
When / ﬁrst saw you

1244
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:24,020
I said, "Oh, my"

1245
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:30,774
lsaid, "Oh, my, that’s a dream

1246
01:15:31,323 --> 01:15:33,780
"That’s my dream"

1247
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,817
I needed a dream

1248
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:41,451
When it all seemed to go bad

1249
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,583
Then / found you

1250
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:50,422
And / have had the most
beautiful dreams

1251
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:55,010
Any man’s ever had

1252
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:58,464
When / ﬁrst saw you

1253
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:02,726
I said, "Oh, my

1254
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:07,765
"Oh, my, that’s my dream

1255
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:11,355
"That’s my dream"

1256
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:17,817
I needed a dream to make me strong

1257
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:25,284
You were the only reason I had to go on

1258
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:30,545
You are my dream

1259
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:35,718
All the things / never knew

1260
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:38,011
You are my dream

1261
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:43,058
Who could believe
they could ever come true?

1262
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:45,386
And who would believe

1263
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:51,100
the world would believe
in my dreams, too?

1264
01:16:57,117 --> 01:17:00,200
When / ﬁrst saw you

1265
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:04,496
I said, "Oh, my

1266
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:08,117
"Oh, my

1267
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:17,840
"That’s my dream"

1268
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,403
-What would make you happy, Deena?
-You know.

1269
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:39,698
We got plenty of time for that.

1270
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:43,444
Please, Curtis. Let me have your child.

1271
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:54,246
-Magic, read your book.
-I'm done.

1272
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:55,998
Then read it again!

1273
01:17:57,511 --> 01:17:59,593
Did you look for work this week,
Miss White?

1274
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:03,304
Mister, you can keep
asking me that question.

1275
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,011
But the answer's always
gonna be the same.

1276
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:08,222
The only thing I know how to do is sing.

1277
01:18:08,313 --> 01:18:10,554
And since there ain't nobody
letting me do that no more,

1278
01:18:10,649 --> 01:18:12,810
no, I did not look for ajob.

1279
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:17,478
Have you considered asking
the girl's father for help?

1280
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:20,401
Magic don't have a father.

1281
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,163
Listen.

1282
01:18:33,129 --> 01:18:35,871
/ know you have questions

1283
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:38,799
Same ones as me

1284
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:43,925
How long has it been?
How long will it be?

1285
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:49,848
When will come the morning
to drive the night away?

1286
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:55,854
Tell me, when will come the morning
of a brighter day?

1287
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,310
Yeah

1288
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:03,990
Patience, little sister

1289
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,322
Patience, little brother

1290
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:14,035
Patience, patience, yeah

1291
01:19:14,921 --> 01:19:17,253
Take each other by the hand

1292
01:19:18,633 --> 01:19:21,045
Yeah, yeah

1293
01:19:21,803 --> 01:19:26,513
Patience, little sisters

1294
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:29,431
Patience...

1295
01:19:33,273 --> 01:19:36,140
-It's from your brother.
-Send it back.

1296
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:39,185
-There's cash in here.
-You spend it.

1297
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:41,357
Effie White, you are a mule.

1298
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:43,734
Come on, baby, it's time to go to bed.

1299
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,531
Just as stubborn as your mother.

1300
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:47,988
Go home, old man.

1301
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:50,737
Magic, come on, baby.

1302
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:57,787
And a mountain to climb

1303
01:19:58,965 --> 01:20:02,583
Patience, patience

1304
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:06,379
It’s gonna take some time

1305
01:20:06,848 --> 01:20:08,634
Yeah, yeah

1306
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:14,137
We must walk in peace

1307
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:15,606
We got to walk in peace

1308
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,897
It’s the only

1309
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:21,351
Only way, yes

1310
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:26,691
If we want to see that morning, yeah

1311
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:27,991
Of a brighter day

1312
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,994
Patience

1313
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:36,120
Come on!

1314
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,200
Little sister

1315
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,459
Patience

1316
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:44,712
Little brother

1317
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:48,466
Patience, patience, yeah

1318
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:50,847
I’m gonna ﬁnd a way

1319
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:58,350
Patience

1320
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:01,855
Little sister

1321
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,402
Patience

1322
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:06,855
Little brother

1323
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:08,110
Nice to see you, Effie.

1324
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:14,195
Of a brighter day

1325
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:19,830
Patience

1326
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:22,879
-Teddy, get yourself back to the party.
-I'm waiting for Deena.

1327
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:47,188
It's good. It's real good.

1328
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:48,397
We wanted to surprise you, Curtis.

1329
01:21:48,492 --> 01:21:50,824
That's why we went ahead
and recorded it first.

1330
01:21:50,911 --> 01:21:52,822
This is exactly what I need
right now, Curtis.

1331
01:21:52,913 --> 01:21:55,325
It's what you've been always
talking about to me, a new sound!

1332
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:57,410
Still, it's a message song.

1333
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,457
It tells the truth.
People are angry out there.

1334
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:05,122
I'm angry.

1335
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:08,007
My brother's over in Vietnam
fighting in a pointless war,

1336
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:09,835
and I'm angry about it.

1337
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,215
That's right, Curtis.

1338
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:13,422
Isn't music supposed to express
what people are feeling?

1339
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:14,927
Music is supposed to sell.

1340
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:21,514
Look, don't worry about it, Jimmy.
We'll find you some new material.

1341
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:24,270
Deena, I want you to meet this guy
out here.

1342
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:28,821
And about the shirt, you should lose it.
It's messing up your image.

1343
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,284
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

1344
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,615
Deena.

1345
01:22:56,852 --> 01:23:00,436
Honey, you don't need to be
doing that stuff right now.

1346
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:03,767
Come on, brother. It's Christmas.

1347
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,144
Jimmy? Baby?

1348
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,489
I'm not staying around for this.

1349
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:28,713
Brother...

1350
01:23:57,079 --> 01:24:00,617
Yeah, but what about Holiday?

1351
01:24:00,707 --> 01:24:04,040
I had Billie here every winter
from '42 to '58.

1352
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:06,747
Great voice. Bad tipper.

1353
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:15,173
Well, I tell you, Effie White is the best
singer this town has seen since then.

1354
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:18,381
Yeah, but the last time she performed,
the girl fell apart.

1355
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:20,052
That was years ago.

1356
01:24:20,143 --> 01:24:23,931
She just lost her confidence for a while.
She's different now.

1357
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:32,443
Max, please. For the old days?

1358
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:35,609
They're gone, Marty.

1359
01:24:40,497 --> 01:24:42,362
Sorry, Marty, but the babysitter was late.

1360
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:46,826
Effie White, this is Max Washington.

1361
01:24:47,087 --> 01:24:49,874
Hi, Max.
Marty said you needed a singer.

1362
01:24:50,841 --> 01:24:54,379
I was just telling Max
that you're serious about working.

1363
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:56,092
He knows all about you.

1364
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:59,713
You do, huh?
Daddy, you don't know the half.

1365
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:02,675
One night after you hire me,
we'll sit down and I'll tell you

1366
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:06,261
all about how I blew through
half a million dollars in two years!

1367
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,096
-Hey, come on.
-Drinking.

1368
01:25:08,525 --> 01:25:10,481
You don't want to take up too much
of the man's time.

1369
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:15,020
-Now, Carl knows all the songs.
-Carl? Where's Bernard?

1370
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:16,400
He has a job in Evanston.

1371
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:18,402
But I can't sing
with someone I don't know.

1372
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:20,358
Effie. You got to.

1373
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:22,991
Marty, I don't have the time.

1374
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:26,288
Max, please. Just give me a minute.

1375
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:35,173
Now, you listen, Effie White.
For four months, I've been your money.

1376
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,091
I've taken you to every club
in this freezing town,

1377
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:39,386
and I'm telling you that this is it.

1378
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:43,511
It's time that you stop making excuses
so that you don't have to prove anything.

1379
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:47,686
You're gonna have to start proving it,
just like the rest of us.

1380
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,982
I don't know.
Maybe Curtis was right about you.

1381
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:55,189
You want all of the privileges
but none of the responsibilities.

1382
01:25:56,823 --> 01:26:00,065
Hey, Max. Thanks anyway, man.
Sorry for wasting your time.

1383
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,025
Do you know the song?

1384
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:03,743
I told you I didn't want to see her.

1385
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:07,539
Well, you are, mister. You are.

1386
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:12,911
Look at me

1387
01:26:13,798 --> 01:26:17,962
Look at me

1388
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:26,009
/ am changing

1389
01:26:28,271 --> 01:26:31,388
Trying every way / can

1390
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,525
/ am changing

1391
01:26:36,946 --> 01:26:39,983
I’ll be better than I am

1392
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:46,700
I’m trying to ﬁnd a way

1393
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:51,075
to understand

1394
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:55,541
But I need you
/ need you

1395
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:00,550
/ need a hand

1396
01:27:01,262 --> 01:27:06,632
/ am changing

1397
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:10,347
Seeing everything so clear

1398
01:27:11,147 --> 01:27:14,685
/ am changing

1399
01:27:15,902 --> 01:27:19,360
I’m gonna start right now, right here

1400
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:24,108
I’m hoping

1401
01:27:24,202 --> 01:27:25,817
To work it out

1402
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:30,368
And / know that I can

1403
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:32,703
But I need you

1404
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:38,919
/ need a hand

1405
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:43,252
All of my life, I’ve been a fool

1406
01:27:43,888 --> 01:27:47,005
who said I could do it all alone

1407
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:51,468
How many good friends
have / already lost?

1408
01:27:52,605 --> 01:27:56,097
And how many dark nights
have / known?

1409
01:27:57,318 --> 01:28:00,651
Walking down that wrong road

1410
01:28:01,614 --> 01:28:04,947
There was nothing / could ﬁnd

1411
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:09,741
All those years of darkness

1412
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:13,665
Could make a person blind

1413
01:28:13,751 --> 01:28:20,168
But now I can see / am changing

1414
01:28:21,759 --> 01:28:24,341
Trying every way / can

1415
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:29,385
/ am changing

1416
01:28:30,393 --> 01:28:33,351
And I’ll be better than I am

1417
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:38,557
But I need a friend

1418
01:28:38,651 --> 01:28:43,611
To help me start all over again

1419
01:28:45,116 --> 01:28:48,859
That would be just ﬁne

1420
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:53,079
/ know it’s gonna work out this time

1421
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:58,122
’Cause this time / am

1422
01:28:58,379 --> 01:29:05,046
This time / am

1423
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:12,600
/ am changing

1424
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:17,141
I’ll get my life together now

1425
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:22,693
/ am changing

1426
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:24,276
Yes!

1427
01:29:24,364 --> 01:29:29,734
/ know how I’m gonna start again

1428
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:36,118
I’m gonna leave my past behind

1429
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:38,324
Right, baby! Sing it loud!

1430
01:29:38,419 --> 01:29:42,537
I’ll change my life

1431
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:48,631
I’ll make a vow

1432
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:55,643
Nothing’s gonna stop me

1433
01:29:58,356 --> 01:30:05,023
HOW

1434
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:18,324
Tonight, live from the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion in Los Ange/es, California,

1435
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:21,330
it’s The Sound of Tomorrow,

1436
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:25,130
celebrating 10 years of hits
from Rainbow Records.

1437
01:30:25,758 --> 01:30:28,170
Every day at school, girl

1438
01:30:28,261 --> 01:30:30,673
I see your smiling face

1439
01:30:30,763 --> 01:30:33,015
The teacher tries to call on me

1440
01:30:33,099 --> 01:30:35,055
But I can’t concentrate

1441
01:30:35,643 --> 01:30:37,929
I’m too busy thinkin’

1442
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:39,977
All about your face

1443
01:30:40,648 --> 01:30:45,267
lknow I’m in love with you
But you don ’t even know my name

1444
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:47,856
Girl meets boy, boy meets girl

1445
01:30:47,947 --> 01:30:50,154
They could fall in love in a perfect world

1446
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:52,732
But if boy and girl never meet

1447
01:30:52,827 --> 01:30:55,364
Then a perfect world can never be

1448
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:56,865
Come on, girl!

1449
01:30:56,956 --> 01:30:58,412
Come on

1450
01:30:58,499 --> 01:30:59,659
llove you!

1451
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:01,248
Come on, Jimmy, drink this.

1452
01:31:03,713 --> 01:31:06,625
-Five minutes, Mr. Early.
-Yeah, all right.

1453
01:31:09,886 --> 01:31:11,376
I thought you were going
to stay clean tonight, baby.

1454
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:13,336
You know how important this is.

1455
01:31:13,431 --> 01:31:16,138
Yeah, lwas doing fine, too, till Melba
came out and messed with me.

1456
01:31:16,726 --> 01:31:18,933
All that, "You never take me nowhere,"

1457
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,386
and, "I'm tired of staying in the house
night after night," shit.

1458
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:25,815
Next thing I know, she's coming
down the stairs in her party dress.

1459
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,606
Wait a minute.

1460
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:34,066
Are you telling me that your wife is
out there right now?

1461
01:31:34,535 --> 01:31:38,153
What was I supposed to do, baby?
That's why I needed to relax.

1462
01:31:39,999 --> 01:31:44,163
-Here, sugar, have a drink.
-Yeah, help me out here. I'm frazzled.

1463
01:31:48,466 --> 01:31:49,751
You know,
it's our anniversary, too, baby.

1464
01:31:49,842 --> 01:31:51,503
Don't you remember?

1465
01:31:52,595 --> 01:31:56,508
-Yeah, I remember that.
-Let me give you a kiss for each year.

1466
01:31:57,517 --> 01:31:59,178
That's sweet.

1467
01:31:59,435 --> 01:32:04,054
One, two, three,

1468
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:09,018
four, five, six,

1469
01:32:09,612 --> 01:32:12,524
seven, eight.

1470
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:20,696
Eight years of unmarried life.

1471
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:23,956
Hey, come on, now. Don't tell me
we're going to start this shit again.

1472
01:32:25,086 --> 01:32:26,997
We'll deal with this
after the show, all right?

1473
01:32:27,088 --> 01:32:29,374
Don't you walk out on me, Jimmy Early!

1474
01:32:29,465 --> 01:32:31,456
Girl meets boy, boy meets girl

1475
01:32:31,843 --> 01:32:34,004
Fall in love, perfect world

1476
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:36,381
But if boy and girl never meet

1477
01:32:36,472 --> 01:32:39,259
Then a perfect world can never be

1478
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,513
Come on, girl!

1479
01:32:45,106 --> 01:32:48,564
-I'm going to tell her, baby, I promise!
-But when, Jimmy? When?

1480
01:32:48,651 --> 01:32:50,061
Please, Ijust need
a little more time, all right?

1481
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:52,901
Time's run out, Jimmy. I get it now.

1482
01:32:53,281 --> 01:32:56,398
-What you talking about?
-You never really loved me.

1483
01:32:57,326 --> 01:33:00,238
Lorrell. Baby, you know I love you.

1484
01:33:00,997 --> 01:33:04,410
I do. But right now, I got a show to do.

1485
01:33:05,668 --> 01:33:07,704
...three, two...

1486
01:33:09,213 --> 01:33:13,297
And now, the mellow sounds
of Jimmy Ear/y.

1487
01:33:21,142 --> 01:33:24,976
I meant you no harm

1488
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:30,106
/ never meant to make you cry

1489
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:36,446
You were the only one
I’ve ever loved in my life

1490
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:40,492
And though it’s hard for me to show it

1491
01:33:41,496 --> 01:33:44,579
I’ve got to let you know it

1492
01:33:45,374 --> 01:33:48,992
’Cause, darling
/ love you more each day

1493
01:33:49,962 --> 01:33:52,578
But the words got in my way

1494
01:33:52,673 --> 01:33:56,962
Oh, I meant you no harm

1495
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:01,888
And / would die

1496
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:05,557
If you ever said goodbye

1497
01:34:05,645 --> 01:34:08,978
llove you
llove you

1498
01:34:09,315 --> 01:34:13,558
I meant you no harm

1499
01:34:14,487 --> 01:34:17,945
/ never, never meant to make you cry

1500
01:34:19,158 --> 01:34:25,825
You were the only one
I’ve ever loved in my life

1501
01:34:26,499 --> 01:34:28,660
Hey, hold it.

1502
01:34:29,085 --> 01:34:31,827
I can’t do it no more.
/ can’t sing no more sad songs.

1503
01:34:32,421 --> 01:34:34,412
Hey, Curtis, this is supposed to be
your night, right?

1504
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:36,668
Let’s have some happy times.
Right, I’m gonna give you a count-off.

1505
01:34:37,385 --> 01:34:38,420
The rest of you all come in
when / tell you, all right?

1506
01:34:38,511 --> 01:34:39,500
What the hell's he doing?

1507
01:34:39,596 --> 01:34:41,757
One! Two! Three! Hit me!

1508
01:34:45,685 --> 01:34:51,305
Bass man, come on up!
One! Two! Three! Hit me!

1509
01:34:52,525 --> 01:34:56,609
Sound good! Yeah! Saxophone!
On the four!

1510
01:34:57,363 --> 01:34:59,615
One! Two! Three! Hit it!

1511
01:35:06,873 --> 01:35:08,784
Come on! Horns! Hit it!

1512
01:35:17,967 --> 01:35:19,878
Hey, Cur/y, let’s rap with Jimmy Ear/y

1513
01:35:19,969 --> 01:35:23,382
Got a home in the hills
Mercedes-Benz, hot swimming pool

1514
01:35:23,473 --> 01:35:24,804
Got lots of friends

1515
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:26,677
Got clothes by the acre
Credit to spare

1516
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:29,259
I could wake up tomorrow
and ﬁnd nobody there

1517
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:31,686
But Jimmy want more
Jimmy want more

1518
01:35:31,773 --> 01:35:34,606
Jimmy want, Jimmy want
Jimmy want more!

1519
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:38,559
Listen!

1520
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:40,816
Jimmy want a rib
Jimmy want a steak

1521
01:35:40,907 --> 01:35:42,943
Jimmy want a piece
of your chocolate cake

1522
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:44,945
But more than all that
Jimmy wants a break

1523
01:35:45,036 --> 01:35:47,743
’Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul

1524
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:50,037
Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul!

1525
01:35:54,587 --> 01:35:56,578
Sooner or later, the time comes around

1526
01:35:56,673 --> 01:35:59,085
For a man to be a man
Take back his sound

1527
01:35:59,175 --> 01:36:01,416
I gotta do somethin’ to shake things up

1528
01:36:01,511 --> 01:36:03,627
/ like Johnny Mathis
But I can’t do that stuff

1529
01:36:03,721 --> 01:36:06,098
’Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul

1530
01:36:06,182 --> 01:36:09,094
Jimmy got S-O-U-L soul!

1531
01:36:15,566 --> 01:36:17,227
I can’t do rock, I can’t do roll

1532
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:19,775
What I can do, baby, is show my soul

1533
01:36:19,862 --> 01:36:22,069
’Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul

1534
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:25,444
Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul!

1535
01:36:25,535 --> 01:36:26,741
Take it out.

1536
01:36:40,383 --> 01:36:42,965
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay in your seats.

1537
01:36:43,052 --> 01:36:44,883
We ’re back live in two minutes.

1538
01:36:45,388 --> 01:36:48,801
-What'd you think of my show, baby?
-You made a fool out of yourself.

1539
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:51,143
What are you talking about, man?
I was just being Jimmy.

1540
01:36:51,227 --> 01:36:53,593
Lorrell, will you please tell him,
if you can?

1541
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:57,226
Jimmy keeps begging you for something
new, but all you do is ignore him.

1542
01:36:57,316 --> 01:36:59,102
Of course he's confused.

1543
01:36:59,193 --> 01:37:03,232
It don't take a whiz to know that only
a desperate man would drop his pants

1544
01:37:03,322 --> 01:37:05,904
in living color on network television.

1545
01:37:05,992 --> 01:37:07,277
Thanks, Lorrell. You told it like it is.

1546
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:10,322
Yeah, well, that ain't all
I got to say to you, sugar.

1547
01:37:10,413 --> 01:37:12,074
My brother, we're through.

1548
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:13,871
What you talking about?
What do you mean, we're through?

1549
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,573
Come on, Jimmy, your time has passed.

1550
01:37:15,668 --> 01:37:18,080
Hey, man, I got soul!
You can't kill a man with soul!

1551
01:37:18,171 --> 01:37:20,162
Come on, man.
Let's at least end as friends, man.

1552
01:37:20,256 --> 01:37:22,417
If you ever need some help,
just give me a call.

1553
01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:28,336
Whatever.

1554
01:37:29,056 --> 01:37:33,015
Hey, Curtis, Idon't beg! Idon't crawl!
I'm an original!

1555
01:37:33,102 --> 01:37:36,139
Hey, where are you going?
You can't leave me, girl. I love you.

1556
01:37:39,358 --> 01:37:44,148
And Lorre/l loves Jimmy

1557
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:50,859
Lorre/l loves Jimmy

1558
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:57,950
Lorre/l loves Jimmy

1559
01:37:58,044 --> 01:38:02,378
It’s true

1560
01:38:03,549 --> 01:38:10,387
But Lorre/l and Jimmy

1561
01:38:10,848 --> 01:38:16,684
are through

1562
01:38:17,063 --> 01:38:20,647
I got a show to do.
Don't you remember, baby?

1563
01:38:21,317 --> 01:38:23,308
on, baby

1564
01:38:23,402 --> 01:38:30,274
I got a show to do

1565
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:45,046
And now, please welcome the brightest
star in the Rainbow constellation,

1566
01:38:45,132 --> 01:38:48,260
Deena Jones
with the incredible Dreams!

1567
01:39:00,856 --> 01:39:02,812
Hello, America.

1568
01:39:03,109 --> 01:39:05,225
What a wonderful evening.

1569
01:39:05,319 --> 01:39:07,355
-/ love you all.
-I love you, Deena!

1570
01:39:07,446 --> 01:39:11,780
llove you, too.
Curtis, baby, this is for you.

1571
01:39:12,451 --> 01:39:16,785
We are a family, like a giant tree

1572
01:39:16,872 --> 01:39:18,863
Branching out toward the sky

1573
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:20,744
We are a family

1574
01:39:20,835 --> 01:39:23,918
We are so much more
More than just you and l

1575
01:39:24,005 --> 01:39:25,961
Time to go, Mr. Early.

1576
01:39:26,132 --> 01:39:32,799
We are growing free

1577
01:39:34,515 --> 01:39:35,504
Yeah!

1578
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,436
I don ’t beg, Curtis!

1579
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:44,514
I don ’t crawl!

1580
01:39:45,735 --> 01:39:48,772
’Cause I was here long before you

1581
01:39:49,822 --> 01:39:55,818
And I’ll be here long after

1582
01:39:56,245 --> 01:40:02,912
You all

1583
01:40:11,093 --> 01:40:13,084
You're an incredibly beautiful woman.

1584
01:40:13,888 --> 01:40:16,504
-Thank you, Jerry.
-No, you're too beautiful.

1585
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:21,680
This movie is about three grifters
heading to Vegas for one final score.

1586
01:40:21,771 --> 01:40:24,433
When Dawn goes down on
that truck driver,

1587
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,805
you've got to smell the desperation.

1588
01:40:27,151 --> 01:40:29,187
I know that. That's what I love about her.

1589
01:40:29,278 --> 01:40:31,815
There's no pretense.
No fucking bullshit.

1590
01:40:33,991 --> 01:40:36,698
America's sweetheart here
has got a potty mouth.

1591
01:40:38,412 --> 01:40:41,449
Of course, if I were to become involved,
we have to do a little work on the part.

1592
01:40:42,666 --> 01:40:46,033
What do you mean?
I spent a year on the script, so...

1593
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:50,163
I know, and it's good.
But she's not real yet.

1594
01:40:50,674 --> 01:40:53,211
To start with,
what kind of name is Dawn?

1595
01:40:53,302 --> 01:40:56,214
I'm from the projects in Detroit and
I ain't ever met a sister named Dawn.

1596
01:40:56,305 --> 01:40:59,172
Well, the script's just a blueprint.
It's not written in stone.

1597
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:03,684
I hear Curtis is still trying to get
that crazy black Cleopatra made.

1598
01:41:04,688 --> 01:41:07,179
Is it true he's got some
mob money tied up in this?

1599
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,102
My husband has his hands full
with the music side right now.

1600
01:41:12,196 --> 01:41:14,187
That's why I didn't want to bother him
with our meeting today.

1601
01:41:18,536 --> 01:41:20,868
So, say we do decide
to get in bed with you on this,

1602
01:41:21,288 --> 01:41:23,244
will Curtis even let you do it?

1603
01:41:23,916 --> 01:41:26,032
I hear he's got you
on a pretty tight leash.

1604
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:28,117
That won't be a problem, Jerry.

1605
01:41:31,757 --> 01:41:33,543
Step, step, step on over

1606
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:36,880
Step, step, step on over

1607
01:41:38,889 --> 01:41:40,470
Wanting you, wanting you

1608
01:41:40,558 --> 01:41:42,389
Needing you, needing you

1609
01:41:43,227 --> 01:41:44,387
Shit.

1610
01:41:47,731 --> 01:41:50,723
-Hey.
-I didn't think it was possible, Curtis.

1611
01:41:50,818 --> 01:41:53,730
But I think you can squeeze
even more of the soul out of my music.

1612
01:41:53,821 --> 01:41:56,028
-We just made it danceable, that's all.
-What about the lyrics?

1613
01:41:56,115 --> 01:41:58,322
That rhythm takes all the feeling
out of the music!

1614
01:41:58,409 --> 01:42:00,821
This is what you've been asking for.
A totally new sound.

1615
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:02,993
It's gonna be bigger than R&B
and rock and roll put together!

1616
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,320
People are getting ready to boogie,

1617
01:42:04,415 --> 01:42:06,451
and when they do
they're gonna do it to our music.

1618
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:09,787
Your music, Curtis.
It has nothing to do with me.

1619
01:42:10,045 --> 01:42:11,546
Come on, brother,
you know you're my main man.

1620
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:13,086
Kiss my ass,

1621
01:42:13,466 --> 01:42:14,626
brother.

1622
01:42:20,431 --> 01:42:22,592
What the hell is going on now?

1623
01:42:27,813 --> 01:42:29,349
No, no!

1624
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:35,693
The body was found at the
Tropicana Hotel in Hollywood.

1625
01:42:35,779 --> 01:42:38,862
Police say Mr. Early had been dead
for over a day,

1626
01:42:38,949 --> 01:42:41,816
the apparent victim
of a heroin overdose.

1627
01:42:41,911 --> 01:42:45,529
The 43-year-old R&B singer was
recently released from his contract

1628
01:42:45,623 --> 01:42:47,284
at Rainbow Records.

1629
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:51,041
She won't let me see him, Deena.

1630
01:42:52,213 --> 01:42:55,376
She won't let me see my Jimmy.

1631
01:42:56,884 --> 01:42:59,500
Plans are being made to fly the body
back to Detroit

1632
01:42:59,595 --> 01:43:00,755
where there will be a private burial.

1633
01:43:00,846 --> 01:43:02,177
What a thing.

1634
01:43:02,973 --> 01:43:04,474
Bad, bad scene.

1635
01:43:05,809 --> 01:43:08,346
Well, thanks for the drink.

1636
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:12,725
Tell Lorrell I'll stop by tomorrow.

1637
01:43:12,816 --> 01:43:15,899
C.C., man, no matter what troubles
we had, you know, we're still a family.

1638
01:43:15,986 --> 01:43:17,726
That's the most important thing.

1639
01:43:18,948 --> 01:43:20,313
It's over, Curtis.

1640
01:43:20,407 --> 01:43:23,149
Oh, come on, man. Jimmy did this
to himself. You know that.

1641
01:43:25,829 --> 01:43:26,818
Michelle?

1642
01:43:28,207 --> 01:43:30,198
0.0. can quit. You can't.

1643
01:43:51,063 --> 01:43:52,178
What's a wake?

1644
01:43:52,898 --> 01:43:55,890
It's when friends get together
and share their love for someone.

1645
01:43:57,027 --> 01:44:02,147
-Mama, why are you so slow?
-'Cause I'm old, baby. I'm old.

1646
01:44:10,499 --> 01:44:11,864
Who are you?

1647
01:44:15,337 --> 01:44:16,747
Effie!

1648
01:44:17,422 --> 01:44:18,548
Effie!

1649
01:44:20,092 --> 01:44:23,880
-Who's that man?
-That's your uncle, little girl.

1650
01:44:26,723 --> 01:44:28,509
Effie! Shit.

1651
01:44:33,564 --> 01:44:36,101
Jimmy had so much life.

1652
01:44:36,858 --> 01:44:39,986
First time / met him
was right here in this club.

1653
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:43,938
He wasn’t "Thunder” Ear/y then,
just little Jimmy.

1654
01:44:44,825 --> 01:44:49,194
-How old was that boy, Marty?
-I don't know. Probably 12.

1655
01:44:49,496 --> 01:44:53,785
Well, he had hands
the size of a fellow twice his age,

1656
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:56,207
and he wasn’t shy
about using them either.

1657
01:44:56,295 --> 01:44:58,707
Yeah, Jimmy was a real little shit.

1658
01:44:59,214 --> 01:45:01,250
-A real little shit.
-Shit.

1659
01:45:04,219 --> 01:45:08,929
lmiss you, old friend

1660
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:11,382
Can I hold you?

1661
01:45:11,977 --> 01:45:16,892
And though it’s been a long time
Old friend

1662
01:45:17,566 --> 01:45:20,103
Do you mind?

1663
01:45:20,777 --> 01:45:25,441
There were so many things

1664
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:30,068
/ wish / had said

1665
01:45:30,871 --> 01:45:34,034
lmeant to love you

1666
01:45:35,208 --> 01:45:38,826
But I hurt you instead

1667
01:45:39,963 --> 01:45:42,830
I’ve come here now

1668
01:45:44,843 --> 01:45:47,630
To make amends

1669
01:45:47,929 --> 01:45:51,592
Can I sit down beside you?

1670
01:45:51,683 --> 01:45:55,346
Can we be close again?

1671
01:46:00,525 --> 01:46:05,064
’Cause I, lmiss you, old friend

1672
01:46:05,989 --> 01:46:08,480
Can I hold you?

1673
01:46:09,201 --> 01:46:12,113
And though it’s been a long time
Old friend

1674
01:46:12,287 --> 01:46:13,367
Effie?

1675
01:46:14,498 --> 01:46:18,537
What gives you the nerve, C.C.,
coming here after all of these years?

1676
01:46:19,378 --> 01:46:22,165
Effie, all I can say is I was young
and I made a mistake.

1677
01:46:22,255 --> 01:46:27,090
I'm telling you. I won't be used.
Not by you, not by anybody.

1678
01:46:27,636 --> 01:46:32,756
I promised you I would write you
a hit song. Let me do it for you now.

1679
01:46:34,267 --> 01:46:36,883
I don't need you.

1680
01:46:36,978 --> 01:46:38,479
No, Effie, I need you.

1681
01:46:40,982 --> 01:46:46,147
Efﬁe, it’s been all these years

1682
01:46:46,905 --> 01:46:51,069
You haven ’t even said hello

1683
01:46:51,618 --> 01:46:55,611
I’m your brother, Efﬁe

1684
01:46:56,373 --> 01:46:59,206
Say hello

1685
01:46:59,876 --> 01:47:04,415
Come on, Efﬁe, you know I’m sorry

1686
01:47:05,048 --> 01:47:09,382
/ should have come before today

1687
01:47:09,469 --> 01:47:15,135
Hold me, is all I have to say

1688
01:47:17,728 --> 01:47:20,140
You’ve always been the baby

1689
01:47:20,230 --> 01:47:22,812
But I’m trying to change

1690
01:47:22,899 --> 01:47:25,515
And so am /

1691
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:29,478
It’s taken all these years to be free

1692
01:47:29,573 --> 01:47:31,438
from loving that man

1693
01:47:31,533 --> 01:47:32,739
Finding myself

1694
01:47:32,826 --> 01:47:37,195
And getting a hold of the anger in me

1695
01:47:37,456 --> 01:47:41,074
Efﬁe, lhave a song

1696
01:47:41,168 --> 01:47:44,706
And only you can sing it
the way it should be

1697
01:47:44,796 --> 01:47:47,082
I’ve waited so long

1698
01:47:47,174 --> 01:47:50,792
To hear you say that to me

1699
01:47:50,886 --> 01:47:54,925
Say it again, say it again

1700
01:47:55,015 --> 01:48:01,853
Efﬁe, sing my song the way it should be

1701
01:48:16,661 --> 01:48:23,578
You want all my love and my devotion

1702
01:48:26,463 --> 01:48:30,752
You want my loving soul

1703
01:48:30,842 --> 01:48:36,553
Right on the line

1704
01:48:37,474 --> 01:48:40,466
l have no doubt

1705
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:46,430
That I could love you forever

1706
01:48:46,525 --> 01:48:50,894
The only trouble is

1707
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:55,773
You really don ’t have the time

1708
01:48:55,867 --> 01:48:59,200
You’ve got one night only

1709
01:48:59,287 --> 01:49:01,403
One night only

1710
01:49:01,498 --> 01:49:05,241
That’s all you have to spare

1711
01:49:06,586 --> 01:49:08,793
One night only

1712
01:49:09,339 --> 01:49:14,174
Let’s not pretend to care

1713
01:49:16,888 --> 01:49:21,507
One night only
One night only

1714
01:49:21,601 --> 01:49:25,310
Come on, big baby, come on

1715
01:49:26,565 --> 01:49:28,851
One night only

1716
01:49:28,942 --> 01:49:35,438
We only have till dawn

1717
01:49:37,242 --> 01:49:41,235
In the morning this feeling will be gone

1718
01:49:41,872 --> 01:49:45,706
It has no chance going on

1719
01:49:46,918 --> 01:49:51,833
Something so right
has got no chance to live

1720
01:49:53,592 --> 01:49:56,584
So let’s forget about chances

1721
01:49:57,012 --> 01:50:02,848
It’s one night / will give

1722
01:50:02,934 --> 01:50:05,016
One night only

1723
01:50:05,103 --> 01:50:07,435
One night only

1724
01:50:07,522 --> 01:50:11,856
You’ll be the only one

1725
01:50:12,777 --> 01:50:15,189
One night only

1726
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:21,776
Then you have to run

1727
01:50:22,579 --> 01:50:25,286
One night only

1728
01:50:25,373 --> 01:50:27,409
One night only

1729
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,867
There’s nothing more to say

1730
01:50:32,756 --> 01:50:35,213
One night only

1731
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:40,135
Words get in the way

1732
01:50:42,807 --> 01:50:45,935
One night only

1733
01:50:47,812 --> 01:50:51,680
One night only

1734
01:50:52,484 --> 01:50:58,400
One night only

1735
01:51:00,867 --> 01:51:02,983
-Trying to make a fool of me.
-Well, Nicky said that

1736
01:51:03,078 --> 01:51:06,070
the song's only got local distribution.
Detroit stations mostly.

1737
01:51:06,164 --> 01:51:07,540
C.C. wrote it,
so that means we own it, right?

1738
01:51:07,624 --> 01:51:08,739
Well, technically, yeah.

1739
01:51:08,834 --> 01:51:10,574
Look, I'll get the lawyers
to draw up an agreement,

1740
01:51:10,669 --> 01:51:12,034
we'll demand half the royalties.

1741
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,914
No, no. This is the perfect song
to launch my new sound.

1742
01:51:14,005 --> 01:51:15,586
I want Deena to re-record it
with the girls.

1743
01:51:15,674 --> 01:51:17,084
Come on, Curtis,
the song's already moving.

1744
01:51:17,175 --> 01:51:18,551
If I can buy a hit, I can buy a flop.

1745
01:51:18,635 --> 01:51:21,297
Hey, man. This is Effie's big break.

1746
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,598
-There's other songs.
-It's business. Get on it.

1747
01:51:51,167 --> 01:51:53,158
Come on, baby

1748
01:51:55,171 --> 01:51:56,672
Come on, baby

1749
01:51:59,759 --> 01:52:01,010
One night only

1750
01:52:04,014 --> 01:52:08,849
You want all my love and my devotion

1751
01:52:10,395 --> 01:52:15,765
You want my loving soul
right on the line

1752
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,146
l have no doubt

1753
01:52:19,237 --> 01:52:23,150
That I could love you forever

1754
01:52:23,241 --> 01:52:26,108
The only trouble is

1755
01:52:26,202 --> 01:52:29,285
/ real/y don ’t have the time

1756
01:52:29,372 --> 01:52:32,785
I’ve got one night only
One night only

1757
01:52:32,876 --> 01:52:35,993
That’s all I have to spare

1758
01:52:36,087 --> 01:52:37,748
One night only

1759
01:52:37,839 --> 01:52:40,956
Let’s to not pretend to care

1760
01:52:41,051 --> 01:52:45,465
I’ve got one night only
One night only

1761
01:52:45,555 --> 01:52:47,841
Come on, big baby, come on

1762
01:52:49,059 --> 01:52:50,424
One night only

1763
01:52:50,518 --> 01:52:53,430
We only have till dawn

1764
01:52:55,273 --> 01:52:56,854
We only have till dawn

1765
01:53:00,278 --> 01:53:03,520
One night only
One night only

1766
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:25,758
One night only, yeah

1767
01:53:27,263 --> 01:53:28,969
Come on, come on

1768
01:53:29,057 --> 01:53:31,548
One night only

1769
01:53:45,115 --> 01:53:47,606
Oh, Cecil Osborne.
Cecil Osborne finally committed.

1770
01:53:47,701 --> 01:53:49,532
And he's soaking me
for a million bucks, but I don't care,

1771
01:53:49,619 --> 01:53:53,203
because he's great with actors,
Cleopatra is your first movie,

1772
01:53:53,289 --> 01:53:55,280
and I don't want anything
but the best for you, sweetheart.

1773
01:53:57,836 --> 01:53:58,996
What's wrong?

1774
01:53:59,879 --> 01:54:02,621
Nothing, Curtis. I guess
I never thought it would really happen.

1775
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:05,297
You made it happen!

1776
01:54:05,593 --> 01:54:08,130
I mean, you are the queen of disco.

1777
01:54:08,972 --> 01:54:10,803
Maybe I'm just tired.

1778
01:54:11,224 --> 01:54:14,808
Yeah, you got your interviews
and your photo shoot with Vogue,

1779
01:54:15,979 --> 01:54:17,264
private meetings by the pool.

1780
01:54:22,652 --> 01:54:23,687
You think I'm stupid?

1781
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:26,986
When was you gonna tell me?

1782
01:54:28,033 --> 01:54:30,615
I'm sorry, Curtis.
I know I should have talked to you.

1783
01:54:31,703 --> 01:54:34,410
It's just that this part is perfect.

1784
01:54:34,497 --> 01:54:36,408
It's exactly the kind of movie
I should be making.

1785
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:40,409
Curtis, baby, nobody knows music
the way you do.

1786
01:54:40,503 --> 01:54:42,494
It's in your blood.

1787
01:54:43,089 --> 01:54:44,670
But movies are different.

1788
01:54:53,850 --> 01:54:55,590
Deena, you know why
I chose you to sing lead?

1789
01:54:56,936 --> 01:54:58,847
Because your voice

1790
01:55:00,398 --> 01:55:03,014
has no personality, no depth.

1791
01:55:03,777 --> 01:55:05,733
Except for what I put in it.

1792
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:08,232
See, nobody knows you like I do.

1793
01:55:08,323 --> 01:55:10,279
Well, they offered me the part
and I'm taking it.

1794
01:55:10,366 --> 01:55:12,618
Do you read contracts,
or are you just pretty?

1795
01:55:12,702 --> 01:55:15,239
You can't even take a shit and wipe
your own ass unless I say it's okay.

1796
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:18,242
-Well, I'll get myself a lawyer.
-What do you think they're gonna do?

1797
01:55:18,333 --> 01:55:20,198
You think them honkies
are gonna wait around

1798
01:55:20,293 --> 01:55:21,703
while you try to drag me into court?

1799
01:55:21,795 --> 01:55:23,877
Forget about it! It's over!

1800
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:33,800
Listen, I don't want
those men handling you,

1801
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:35,972
because they don't know how.

1802
01:55:36,309 --> 01:55:37,640
And, Deena,

1803
01:55:40,146 --> 01:55:41,602
I forgive you.

1804
01:55:47,987 --> 01:55:50,478
Curtis will always be here for you.

1805
01:55:53,034 --> 01:55:59,872
Listen to the song here in my heart

1806
01:56:00,625 --> 01:56:07,588
A melody I start but can’t complete

1807
01:56:08,716 --> 01:56:15,633
Listen to the sound from deep within

1808
01:56:16,349 --> 01:56:22,845
It’s only beginning to ﬁnd release

1809
01:56:23,231 --> 01:56:28,100
Oh, the time has come
for my dreams to be heard

1810
01:56:28,194 --> 01:56:30,901
They will not be pushed aside

1811
01:56:30,989 --> 01:56:33,901
and turned into your own

1812
01:56:33,992 --> 01:56:38,952
All ’cause you won ’t listen

1813
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:41,620
Listen

1814
01:56:41,708 --> 01:56:45,200
/ am alone at a crossroads

1815
01:56:45,712 --> 01:56:48,749
I’m not at home in my own home

1816
01:56:49,215 --> 01:56:53,049
And I’ve tried and tried
to say what’s on my mind

1817
01:56:53,136 --> 01:56:55,468
You should have known

1818
01:56:56,806 --> 01:57:00,298
Now I’m done believing you

You don ’t know what I’m feeling

1820
01:57:02,937 --> 01:57:06,304

1822
01:57:11,821 --> 01:57:17,862
But now I’ve got to ﬁnd my own

1823
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:21,695
You should have listened

1824
01:57:22,498 --> 01:57:26,582
There is someone here inside

1825
01:57:26,669 --> 01:57:29,627
Someone I thought had died

1826
01:57:29,714 --> 01:57:33,252
So long ago

1827
01:57:33,343 --> 01:57:38,428
Oh, I’m screaming out
And my dreams will be heard

1828
01:57:38,514 --> 01:57:44,180
They will not be pushed aside or worse
into your own

1829
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:49,769

Marty. Long time.

1854
01:59:49,479 --> 01:59:52,812
Yeah, Curtis.
And you're still a second-class snake.

1855
01:59:54,609 --> 01:59:58,352
First-class to you.
Gentlemen, give me a break.

1856
01:59:58,863 --> 02:00:00,364
Why, Curtis? Did you give Effie one?

1857
02:00:01,157 --> 02:00:04,274
-I could kill you for what you did to her.
-You couldn't kill shit.

1858
02:00:05,703 --> 02:00:07,489
I assume you guys have a reason
for barging in here

1859
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:08,740
other than to insult me.

1860
02:00:09,415 --> 02:00:12,248
Mr. Taylor, we're planning to go
to the federal authorities.

1861
02:00:13,002 --> 02:00:16,836
Yeah, we'll tell the feds how
you killed Effie's record. Payola, man.

1862
02:00:17,924 --> 02:00:20,131
You remember, Curtis, Iwitnessed it all.

1863
02:00:20,218 --> 02:00:22,960
The whole dirty operation going back
to Steppin' to the Bad Side.

1864
02:00:23,054 --> 02:00:24,885
That's right you did,
but who's going to believe you?

1865
02:00:24,972 --> 02:00:27,384
All you are is a guy that's pissed off
'cause you got fired.

1866
02:00:28,184 --> 02:00:30,300
We have documented evidence,
Mr. Taylor.

1867
02:00:30,395 --> 02:00:33,933
Falsified sales records
to cheat investors out of their profits,

1868
02:00:34,023 --> 02:00:37,936
goods-quality merchandise listed
as cutouts to disguise the fraud,

1869
02:00:38,361 --> 02:00:39,771
mob-backed loans,

1870
02:00:39,862 --> 02:00:43,525
and a payola operation
stretching back 11 years.

1871
02:00:46,869 --> 02:00:48,200
Who gave you this?

1872
02:00:48,663 --> 02:00:51,700
Believe me, I had no idea
what Curtis was trying to do to you.

1873
02:00:52,625 --> 02:00:55,708
Effie, are you all right?

1874
02:00:57,422 --> 02:01:01,256
I'm happy now, Deena.
I have a child who loves me.

1875
02:01:01,759 --> 02:01:05,377
-You have a baby?
-Magic's not exactly a baby anymore.

1876
02:01:07,849 --> 02:01:09,589
She's almost nine now.

1877
02:01:11,686 --> 02:01:16,305
I wanted to tell you.
At the time, I really wanted to tell you.

1878
02:01:18,401 --> 02:01:19,561
Deena, he doesn't know.

1879
02:01:21,362 --> 02:01:23,398
Effie, Effie, Effie.

1880
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:27,485
Well, I see you're just as much trouble
as you ever were.

1881
02:01:28,411 --> 02:01:29,901
Hello, Curtis.

1882
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:32,821
You haven't changed much, either.

1883
02:01:35,126 --> 02:01:39,995
Actually, I take that back.
You are looking a little heavy, baby.

1884
02:01:40,381 --> 02:01:42,417
You could lose some weight.

1885
02:01:51,559 --> 02:01:53,424
I'll deal with you later.

1886
02:01:56,439 --> 02:01:59,931
Mr. Taylor agrees it's in everyone's
interest to resolve the situation

1887
02:02:00,026 --> 02:02:02,688
without resorting
to draconian legal measures.

1888
02:02:02,778 --> 02:02:03,813
Say that in English.

1889
02:02:03,905 --> 02:02:07,022
Nationwide distribution of our
version of One Night Only, Effie.

1890
02:02:07,116 --> 02:02:10,324
-On our own label.
-That sounds good to me.

1891
02:02:10,411 --> 02:02:13,574
And remember, Curtis,
if these negotiations fall apart

1892
02:02:13,664 --> 02:02:15,370
you're going straight to jail.

1893
02:02:15,458 --> 02:02:16,538
That's right, Curtis.

1894
02:02:16,626 --> 02:02:19,959
You stopped me once,
but you'll never stop me again.

1895
02:02:20,671 --> 02:02:24,334
’Cause this time

1896
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:31,801
Efﬁe White’s gonna

1897
02:02:32,975 --> 02:02:34,260
win

1898
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:52,445
Deena! Get your ass out here!

1899
02:02:52,537 --> 02:02:53,572
Hello, Curtis.

1900
02:02:53,996 --> 02:02:58,239
Hey, May. What are you doing here?
I mean, I thought you said you hate LA.

1901
02:02:58,334 --> 02:03:02,748
Oh, I do. But my daughter said
she needed me, so I'm here.

1902
02:03:03,214 --> 02:03:04,829
Go wait in the car, Mama.

1903
02:03:07,885 --> 02:03:09,386
That was a dirty trick you pulled on me.

1904
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:11,461
I had to do something
to stop you, Curtis.

1905
02:03:11,556 --> 02:03:14,639
-How could you do that to Effie?
-I had to do what I had to.

1906
02:03:14,725 --> 02:03:15,714
Where do you think you're going?

1907
02:03:15,893 --> 02:03:18,635
Out looking for a new sound, baby,
just like you.

1908
02:03:18,729 --> 02:03:21,687
-You can't leave.
-Why? Because you own me?

1909
02:03:22,233 --> 02:03:25,851
You can sue me.
You can take everything I have!

1910
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:28,436
It don't matter, 'cause I'll start over.

1911
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:31,698
It don't matter, 'cause I'll start over.
Effie did it and so can I.

1912
02:03:31,785 --> 02:03:34,697
Listen, I'm not living without you.
I love you.

1913
02:03:36,665 --> 02:03:40,954
I'm sorry, Curtis.
I can't do this anymore.

1914
02:03:50,804 --> 02:03:51,919
Good bye.

1915
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:27,620
Good to see you, Curtis.

1916
02:04:29,467 --> 02:04:31,003
Mr. Taylor?

1917
02:04:31,094 --> 02:04:34,086
Mr. Taylor, this must be
a bittersweet night.

1918
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:37,217
How does it feel
to say goodbye to The Dreams?

1919
02:04:37,309 --> 02:04:39,049
I don't believe in goodbyes, just hellos.

1920
02:04:39,394 --> 02:04:42,010
And I want you all to say hello
to Tania Williams.

1921
02:04:42,647 --> 02:04:44,603
We're releasing Tania's first album
next month

1922
02:04:44,691 --> 02:04:47,023
and let me tell you, it is dynamite.

1923
02:04:49,029 --> 02:04:53,318
Ladies and gentlemen, back in Detroit
for their farewell performance,

1924
02:04:53,533 --> 02:04:55,899
the incredible Dreams.

1925
02:05:09,299 --> 02:05:11,836
We didn’t make forever

1926
02:05:12,469 --> 02:05:15,677
We’ve each got to go our separate way

1927
02:05:16,181 --> 02:05:19,298
And now we’re standing here helpless

1928
02:05:19,643 --> 02:05:22,885
Looking for something to say

1929
02:05:23,230 --> 02:05:26,438
We’ve been together a long time

1930
02:05:26,608 --> 02:05:30,066
We never thought it would end

1931
02:05:30,529 --> 02:05:33,612
We were always so close to each other

1932
02:05:33,699 --> 02:05:36,611
You were always my friend

1933
02:05:36,702 --> 02:05:40,115
And it’s hard to say goodbye, my love

1934
02:05:40,664 --> 02:05:43,701
It’s hard to see you cry, my love

1935
02:05:44,126 --> 02:05:47,289
Hard to open up that door

1936
02:05:47,379 --> 02:05:50,712
When you’re not sure
what you’re going for

1937
02:05:58,223 --> 02:06:01,340
We didn’t want this to happen

1938
02:06:01,852 --> 02:06:04,764
But we shouldn’t feel sad

1939
02:06:04,855 --> 02:06:08,313
We had a good life together

1940
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:12,063
Just remember all the times we had

1941
02:06:12,154 --> 02:06:15,612
You know I’ll always love you

1942
02:06:15,699 --> 02:06:18,486
You know I’ll always care

1943
02:06:18,577 --> 02:06:22,536
And no matter how far! may go

1944
02:06:22,622 --> 02:06:27,241
In my heart you’ll always be there

1945
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:32,287
And it’s hard to say goodbye, my love

1946
02:06:32,382 --> 02:06:35,966
It’s hard to see you cry, my love

1947
02:06:36,052 --> 02:06:39,260
It’s hard to open up that door

1948
02:06:39,598 --> 02:06:43,182
When you’re not sure
what you’re going for

1949
02:06:43,268 --> 02:06:46,101
But we’ve got to grow
We ’ve got to try

1950
02:06:46,188 --> 02:06:48,224
Though it’s hard, so hard

1951
02:06:48,315 --> 02:06:50,431
We have to say goodbye

1952
02:06:50,525 --> 02:06:53,517
We didn’t make forever

1953
02:06:53,612 --> 02:06:56,900
But / will always love you

1954
02:06:56,990 --> 02:07:00,403
We didn’t make forever

1955
02:07:00,494 --> 02:07:04,032
But / will always love you

1956
02:07:04,122 --> 02:07:06,659
It’s so hard

1957
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:09,617
Baby, it’s so hard

1958
02:07:10,629 --> 02:07:13,041
It’s so hard

1959
02:07:13,715 --> 02:07:16,001
Baby, it’s so hard

1960
02:07:16,092 --> 02:07:17,548
I’ll always love you

1961
02:07:17,636 --> 02:07:19,797
It’s so hard

1962
02:07:20,722 --> 02:07:22,963
Baby, it’s so hard

1963
02:07:24,851 --> 02:07:26,307
Yeah!

1964
02:07:39,032 --> 02:07:42,115
Well, I guess it’s about that time.

1965
02:07:42,619 --> 02:07:44,200
The last song.

1966
02:07:44,663 --> 02:07:47,200
You know, we’ve been together
a very long time.

1967
02:07:48,041 --> 02:07:50,407
And / promised Lorre/l / wouldn’t cry.

1968
02:07:52,462 --> 02:07:54,168
And I’m not.

1969
02:07:55,006 --> 02:07:56,667
I’m very happy.

1970
02:07:57,050 --> 02:07:59,507
All of our family is here tonight.

1971
02:07:59,886 --> 02:08:02,753
You know, there really aren’t
three Dreams.

1972
02:08:02,848 --> 02:08:04,509
There are four.

1973
02:08:04,850 --> 02:08:08,013
And we’re all here
to sing that song for you.

1974
02:08:09,396 --> 02:08:10,636
Efﬁe.

1975
02:08:41,678 --> 02:08:48,641
Every man has his own special dream

1976
02:08:49,728 --> 02:08:55,564
And that dream’s
just about to come true

1977
02:08:55,942 --> 02:09:00,231
Life’s not as bad as it may seem

1978
02:09:00,322 --> 02:09:06,613
If you open your eyes
to what’s in front of you

1979
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:10,362
We ’re your dream girls

1980
02:09:10,457 --> 02:09:13,824
Boys, we’ll make you happy

1981
02:09:17,047 --> 02:09:19,834
We ’re your dream girls

1982
02:09:19,925 --> 02:09:24,168
Boys, we’ll always care

1983
02:09:24,262 --> 02:09:26,844
We 7/ always care

1984
02:09:26,932 --> 02:09:29,514
We ’re your dream girls

1985
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:32,934
Dream girls will never leave you

1986
02:09:33,021 --> 02:09:36,513
Never, never, never, never,
never leave you

1987
02:09:36,608 --> 02:09:41,693
And all you’ve got to do is dream

1988
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:45,068
All you’ve got to do is dream

1989
02:09:45,158 --> 02:09:49,276
Just dream and, baby

1990
02:09:49,663 --> 02:09:52,996

1991
02:09:56,252 --> 02:10:02,168
there

1992
02:10:04,636 --> 02:10:09,300
We 7/ be there

1993
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:19,606
We 7/ be there

1994
02:10:24,114 --> 02:10:29,654
We 7/ be there
