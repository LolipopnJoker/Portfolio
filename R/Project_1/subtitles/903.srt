1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,900
All right, Coop.
A hundred and five degrees.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,500
- What do you say?
- 105? I can go more.

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,800
107.

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,300
- 108.
- I'm feeling it.

5
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,000
109.

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,400
OK, the suspense is killing me.

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,900
- All right, 110.
- 110?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
- 110.
- A hundred and ten toasty ones.

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,200
Right. Ready to go out
and greet the heat?

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,800
The warm wind in my hair?

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,300
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,400
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

13
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,900
Thirty-one. Thirty-one degrees.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,100
- Thirty-one below.
- Thirty-one below! New record!

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,300
- Thirty-one below!
- New record!

16
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,500
New record! Oh, it's cold!

17
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,300
I hate to do this, but...

18
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,700
Rise and shine, kids.
No more sleeping in.

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
All right.
If "rise and shine" won't work...

20
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,300
Is anybody hungry this morning?

21
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Attaboy, Max.

22
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,100
Hey, what do you say?
Ready for exercise before breakfast?

23
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,700
How you doing?

24
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,100
How does right field look?

25
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,700
I think it looks pretty good.
What do you say, Max? Here we go.

26
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,900
Go get it!

27
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,100
Hey, Maya.

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
How's my best girl doing, huh?

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
How you doing?

30
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,000
You keeping everybody in line?

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,100
Left field. Go get it.

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,300
Left field, Maya. Here we go.

33
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Go get it!

34
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,700
Attaboy, Max. Come here, buddy.

35
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Settle down.
There's plenty to go around, guys.

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,700
Here you go, Shorty.

37
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,300
Good boy, Shadow.

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Dewey. Truman.

39
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,100
There you go, Old Jack.

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,700
That's my best girl.
Here, I'll trade you.

41
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,800
There you go, Maya.

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,100
- Hi.
- Hey.

43
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
- Didn't think I'd see you this year.
- Guess you got lucky.

44
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,800
- I guess so.
- Crazy Katie!

45
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,800
- Did you get your pilot's license yet?
- Oh, Coop, I missed you.

46
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,300
OK.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,500
- Got that?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
Hey, hey, careful with that.

49
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,100
That equipment's made it 10,000 miles.
I'd hate that to change in six feet.

50
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,900
Sorry about that.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Hi. I'm Dr. Davis McClaren.

52
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Earth and Space Sciences UCLA.

53
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,900
Jerry Shepard, expedition guide.
Welcome to the bottom of the world.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

55
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,700
Go any further south,
you'll fall off the planet.

56
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,100
Well, that'd be unfortunate.

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,000
Charlie Cooper, cartographer,
mechanical engineer, runway paver.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Dr. McClaren! Welcome to the ice.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Andy Harrison, NSF science director.
An honor to meet you.

60
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,400
- Dr. Rosemary Paris, field coordinator.
- Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,800
You've met our team?

62
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,100
Yeah, Mr. Cooper was just taking
good care of all my things.

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Cooper, really?
First time for everything, I suppose.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,800
- Let's get you inside.
- Thanks.

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,100
- Sure.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,000
OK. Lady luck, in my corner.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
- What are we playing?
- She is pretty.

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,300
- Quarter in.
- Quarter.

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,200
- You're going down.
- You're going down.

70
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,000
Crazy Katie, you're going down.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,500
- Hey, doc, you want in?
- No, thanks.

72
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,400
I gave up gambling a long time ago.

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,800
Hey, you flew in with Katie, didn't you?

74
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,400
Remind me how you're getting home.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Say, Old Jack, you in or out, buddy?

76
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,100
- Translation?
- That'd be out.

77
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,700
- So, Coop, how's the new girlfriend?
- Mmm.

78
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
How's my new girl?

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
I don't know.

80
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,100
- How about hot?
- Wow.

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,500
- Huh?
- Wow.

82
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
She's a scientist too.
At the Italian base.

83
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,100
- Pretty and smart.
- Smarts.

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,700
Yeah. Notice something
missing in that picture?

85
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,400
OK, OK. I think...
I know you mean me.

86
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,200
You're talk... The picture's coming.
She's sending one of the two of us, OK?

87
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,400
Patience, Jer.

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,800
- Uh-huh. How many?
- Two.

89
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,700
Doc, you looking forward
to your first trip to Dry Valleys?

90
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
It's a pretty cool spot
this time of year.

91
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,100
Actually, Dr. McClaren
needs to get to Mt. Melbourne

92
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
to search for his meteorite.

93
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Melbourne, huh?

94
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Nobody said anything about Melbourne.

95
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah. Meteorite hunting
is a pretty small world

96
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,200
and, uh, I didn't want anybody
to know where I was really going,

97
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,900
'cause I'm looking
for something special at Melbourne

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,700
and the NSF let us
keep it off the paperwork.

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
Is there a problem?

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Look, doc, let me show you something.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll show you on the map.

102
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
- This is where we are, right? OK.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000
Here's Dry Valleys.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
All the way over here, Mt. Melbourne.
Twice as far and the opposite direction.

105
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,700
I've been over our route twice
in the last week,

106
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,100
but I haven't been to Mt. Melbourne
since the beginning of the season.

107
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Well, that may be so. But
Dr. McClaren has traveled a long way.

108
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,900
- If we can accommodate him, we should.
- Andy, it's the end of January.

109
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,800
The ice is too thin and snowmobiles
would be too dangerous.

110
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,000
There's only one way
to make that trip, with the dogs.

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,100
The dogs?

112
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,600
OK. Will they be able
to carry all my gear?

113
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
The dogs'll be fine.

114
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
- It's really late in the season.
- Last year we had the dogs out

115
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,300
right up until the day we left.

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,900
All right, Andy.
You're the boss. I'll get things ready.

117
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,300
- Hey, you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

118
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
Coop, say good night to Buck.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,100
Uh, I'm gonna take a rain check, Jer.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
Ah...

121
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,600
Kids, come on! Let's go!

122
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,900
Everyone outside. Let's get you
tucked into bed. Come on.

123
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Good, Jack.

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,700
Good boy. I'll see you in the morning.

125
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Hey, Maya.

126
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,700
What do you say? One more trip, huh?

127
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,100
Then we'll get you to McMurdo
for the winter. That sound good?

128
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,500
Huh? That sound good? That's my girl.

129
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Hey, Max. I need a good trip out of you.

130
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,100
Lucky star, huh? Let's hope so.

131
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,700
See you in the morning, Max.

132
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,100
Knock, knock.

133
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,300
I warmed up some of
your favorite ice cream.

135
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,800
Strawberry.
That's your favorite ice cream.

136
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,400
Yeah, well, you got here early.
I didn't have time to go shopping.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,100
Uh, yeah, well, they changed things up.

138
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000
How you been?

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Been a good season. Kids are doing well.

140
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,700
Maya's been awesome.
Old Jack's getting a bit older, so...

141
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,200
Jerry, I was asking you how you've been.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm not interrupting or anything, am I?

143
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,200
No, Rosie. We were just catching up.

144
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
OK.

145
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,000
All right, well, uh...

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,300
I guess I'll see you guys
in the morning, then.

147
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you. That was sweet.

148
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
No problem. Good night.

149
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,600
Good night.

150
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,400
- Pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

151
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,800
Oh!

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh! Head's up.

153
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,000
Sad fact of life in this place, doc.
Floor is more comfy than the bunks.

154
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,800
So, what is it exactly that you do here?

155
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,300
Cartography. I spent the last two years
mapping every inch of this territory.

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,400
Hey, dude.
What happened? You strike out?

157
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
No. I didn't even swing.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,700
Ah, went down looking.
That's still a strike-out, Jer.

159
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,300
- Ow! Ow!
- Sorry about that, buddy.

160
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,100
I didn't see you there.

161
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,600
We turn the heat off at night, so if
there's anything you need to keep warm,

162
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,400
I suggest you sleep with it.

163
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,300
Incoming.

164
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,100
Ow! Jerry!

165
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
Man!

166
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,400
OK, this is the last of it.

167
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Wow, doc.
Won't be losing you, now, will we?

168
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,700
All right, rule number one.

169
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,600
If you want to approach the dogs,
approach them from the front. OK?

170
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,400
- See how the lines are taut?
- Yeah.

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,900
I want them like that at all times.
If the line's tangled, they'll fight.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,700
- We don't want that.
- Got it.

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,900
- Anything else I should know?
- The rest is pretty much up to me.

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I gotta watch them.
They're working dogs.

175
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,600
They'll run themselves to death.
They love work.

176
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
All right, official introductions.

177
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,500
Up here in front, on lead,
we got my best girl, Maya.

178
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Next to her we got Old Jack.

179
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,500
Just turned ten, and, uh, he's
actually getting ready for retirement.

180
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,400
Back here,
the white one, this is Shorty.

181
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,200
And next to him is the pup
of the bunch. That's Max.

182
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,800
He's still in training.

183
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,900
He's got the right stuff.
I expect big things out of him.

184
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,400
Right here, we got the twins.
This is Truman.

185
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,100
Truman took a bite
out of Dewey a couple years ago.

186
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,800
- Notice the scar above Dewey's eye?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah. Well, they've been
buddies ever since, so...

188
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,600
Back here, last but not least,
we got the two malamutes.

189
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,000
The gray one's Shadow
and the red one's his buddy, Buck.

190
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,200
All brawn and absolutely no brain.
But we love 'em.

191
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,000
- Everyone good to go this morning?
- Yeah, I think so.

192
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,600
I was just being introduced
to Maya, Old Jack,

193
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,200
Shorty, Max, Truman,
Dewey, Shadow and Buck.

194
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
- Excellent.
- Jer?

195
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,900
- Be careful out there, OK?
- Always.

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Take care of Cooper for me.

197
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,100
Don't worry. I'll give him
plenty of food and water.

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,700
OK, enough. Are we done?

199
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,900
I'd like a picture of our
intrepid explorers, please. Thank you.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,300
All right. Hang on!

201
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,900
OK.

202
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
OK, you ready?

203
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,400
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

204
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,500
Handsome. So handsome.

205
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Hey, Coop. You'd better get up here
and say goodbye to Buck.

206
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,500
Oh, yeah?

207
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
All right, uh, see you, Buck!

208
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Safe... Safe trip, Buck.

209
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
No. Come over and say goodbye.
You're gonna give him a complex.

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,200
And what about my complex?

211
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Come around... Come say goodbye to him.

212
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm... I'm pretty sure he heard me
say goodbye, Jer. I don't...

213
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
OK. I don't know why you do this.

214
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
OK.

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
See ya, Buck.

216
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,600
All right. You, uh...

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,800
You take care of the doctor
and, uh, Jerry, OK?

218
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh! Oh! Nasty!

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Oh! That was disgusting!

220
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,700
I got dog spit all in my mouth
and my nose!

221
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,100
It's not funny.

222
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't see what's so funny.

223
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
All right.
Take care, guys. We'll see you.

224
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,300
- Bye.
- See ya.

225
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,200
All right, team!
Last hike of the season!

226
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
Let's go! Hike! Hike!

227
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,400
Come on, Jack! Come on, Old Jack!

228
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,800
Let's go, Maya! Come on, girl!

229
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,400
Whoa! Whoa!

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Whoa! Whoa!

231
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
What's the problem?

232
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,200
We got ice fields up ahead.
I don't know how thick the ice is.

233
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,900
That's why we couldn't take
the snowmobiles. Look.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,900
So, what do we do?

235
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm gonna change things up.

236
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,500
Put the dogs
in a fan formation for safety.

237
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,900
It's a little slower,
but it spreads the weight out.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,300
That way if one of the dogs
falls through the ice,

239
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
the lead's long enough
so the rest don't follow.

240
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,700
Hike!

241
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,300
Hey, doc.

242
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
- You see that over there?
- What is that?

243
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,600
Here.

244
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
You see 'em?

245
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,600
- I see 'em. What are they?
- Leopard seals.

246
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
More leopard than seal, if you ask me.

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
- Give 'em a wide birth?
- Yeah, we'll give 'em some space.

248
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

249
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,000
Whoa, kids! Whoa!

250
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,600
- What was that?
- We're on a glacier now.

251
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
We're gonna have to
take her slow, doc. Get off.

252
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I want you to take the brake.
You're gonna run the sled. All right?

253
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Heavy brake.

254
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,800
Follow my footprints.
Keep the sled on my footprints.

255
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,200
- I'll probe ahead.
- Got it.

256
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,600
This glacier's always moving,
so we have to be careful.

257
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,100
All right, doc. Keep two feet
on the brake if you need to.

258
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,200
- Just keep a steady go, all right?
- All right.

259
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,000
All right, kids, come on! Easy, now!

260
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Nice and easy. Let's go.

261
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
All right, stop! Stop!

262
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,900
All right, hard brake, right there!

263
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
We got a crevasse right here.

264
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm not sure how big it is,
so we're gonna go around. OK.

265
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,800
We're gonna bring it over this way.
Slow and easy.

266
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm gonna call Maya over,

267
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,900
and then I just want you
to let up ever so lightly, all right?

268
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,200
- All right, got it.
- All right, Maya, haw! Haw!

269
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Haw! Haw!

270
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,600
Max, what are you doing?

271
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,700
Max, no. Haw!

272
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Max! Stop! Stop, Max! Doc, stop!

273
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
No!

274
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,500
Hold on, doc!

275
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Doc! Put both hands on the sled!
Both hands on the sled, doc!

276
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,400
Hike! Come on, Jack, take it home!

277
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,900
Come on, Maya, take her home!

278
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,900
Come on! Hike!

279
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,300
Oh, man!

280
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,500
You OK?

281
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,400
Yeah.

282
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,700
Do me a favor.

283
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,100
Next time you decide to go to Melbourne,
don't pack so much stuff.

284
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
And try coming a bit earlier.

285
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,200
Andy said the trip was fine.
You agreed to go.

286
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Andy's my boss. I do what he says.

287
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
If you didn't think it was safe,
you shouldn't have backed down.

288
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,500
Easy.

289
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,900
Jerry, thanks for today.

290
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,100
Yeah. No problem.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
Who's the artist?

292
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,200
My son, Eric.

293
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,800
He does one every trip.

294
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,200
He looks like your wife.

295
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,700
Lucky kid.

296
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,400
Yeah.

297
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,900
What about you? You got somebody?

298
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,100
Are you kidding me?

299
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm here six months a year
dragging scientists around.

300
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,800
What kind of woman
would put up with that?

301
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
How about Katie?
Looked like you might've had something.

302
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,100
Yeah. A couple years ago we did.

303
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,500
You know how it goes. Sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't.

304
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,200
I guess relationships
don't fit my lifestyle.

305
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,800
Anyhow, come on. Let's go outside, guys.

306
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,400
We're gonna get an early start tomorrow.
Come on. Come on, Max.

307
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
Come on, Max.

308
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,500
All right, whoa!

309
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,300
Doc, hold it. Put on the brake,
I'm gonna take it from here.

310
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,500
Yeah, got it. Whoa!

311
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
What do you say?

312
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,000
- That's something else.
- That's Melbourne.

313
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
- That's your home for the next week.
- Beautiful.

314
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,200
Ready, now! Hike!

315
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,100
<i>Victoria,
this is McMurdo Weather. Come in.</i>

316
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,300
<i>Victoria? This is McMurdo Weather.</i>

317
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,700
This is Victoria. We copy you, Mactown.

318
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,600
<i>Hi, Andy. It's Steve.
Just checking status on your team.</i>

319
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,300
We've got four at the base
and two in the field. Over.

320
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,300
<i>Suggest you bring them in.</i>

321
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,200
<i>We have two massive
low pressure systems moving south.</i>

322
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,900
<i>Control wants you in early
just to be safe. Over.</i>

323
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Copy that, Mactown. Over and out.

324
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,300
Get Jerry on the radio.

325
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,200
Wanna sling me a cup of that
when you get a chance?

326
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,200
Yeah, sure thing.

327
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
- You got her?
- Yeah, thanks.

328
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
How's that looking there?

329
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,000
Well, everything points
to the spot that we're on.

330
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,600
The next couple days
are gonna tell us a lot.

331
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,700
<i>Field base to Melbourne. Come in.</i>

332
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,400
<i>Base to Melbourne. Come in.</i>

333
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
<i>Jerry?</i>

334
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
<i>Jerry, do you read me? Over.</i>

335
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,200
Yeah, go for Melbourne. That you, Katie?

336
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,800
<i>Jerry, we got a call from Mactown.</i>

337
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,100
<i>...major storm coming in. Over.</i>

338
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,100
You'll have to go again.
We're in a bad spot here.

339
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
<i>Jerry... back to field base.
Do you copy?</i>

340
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,900
<i>We got a major storm coming in.
Mactown wants you in right away. Over.</i>

341
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,400
All right. Copy that. We'll be back.

342
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
When do we expect this storm?

343
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,600
Katie?

344
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,700
Sorry, doc. Looks like
we're gonna have to pack up.

345
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,400
- Well, when do we have to leave?
- We leave first thing, tomorrow.

346
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,100
- Listen, Jerry...
- You heard what she said.

347
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Now, Jerry, look. I cannot
go back without at least trying.

348
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,700
Yeah, well, that's not your call.

349
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
No. It's not.

350
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
There's a major storm coming in,
all right?

351
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,000
Not a minor one, but a major.

352
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,700
Down here there's a big difference
between the two.

353
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,700
My job as your guide
is to get you back home in one piece,

354
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,600
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

355
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,100
But Jerry, we're talking
about a rock from another world.

356
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,700
This ice floe might give us the first
meteorite from the planet Mercury.

357
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,400
That could lead us
to discoveries we can't imagine.

358
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,700
When you climb a mountain,
go up a river,

359
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,200
the exciting part isn't what you know
is there. It's what you don't know.

360
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,000
It's what you might find,
and it's the same here.

361
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,200
I came halfway around the world to look
for something that's important to me.

362
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,500
Jerry, please, you...

363
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,400
You gotta take chances
for the things you care about.

364
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Half the day on the east slope.

365
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,000
But I want to be back
on that sled tomorrow by noon.

366
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,900
I'll take that. I'll take that.

367
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
No.

368
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,200
Hey, we're running
out of time here, doc.

369
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,400
Believe me, I know.

370
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,000
Hey, Jerry.

371
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,300
- I think we got something here.
- Hey, wait, doc!

372
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
Doc, wait a minute. Doc, don't move.

373
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,400
You're outside the safety zone.

374
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,700
This is a big one.
Eleven centimeters across, fully intact.

375
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
It looks like a basalt,
but it's like nothing I've ever seen.

376
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,200
- Jerry!
- Doc! Doc, don't move.

377
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,400
That area's unchecked.
I told you to stay inside the flags.

378
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, my God. This is it!

379
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,200
Great, doc. Stay still.

380
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,500
I'm glad you found your rock,
but let's get you out of there.

381
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,100
Just follow your footsteps out.
Step right in your footprints.

382
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,400
Man, I knew I could find it! Huh?
What'd I tell you? This is it.

383
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Half a day! Thank you.

384
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,800
Now that you scared the hell out of me,
can we go home now?

385
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,900
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

386
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,400
<i>Victoria, this is Mactown. Come in.</i>

387
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,500
Victoria here. We copy you, Mactown.

388
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,200
<i>The approaching storm
has picked up speed and intensity.</i>

389
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,500
<i>We are sending you the coordinates.
Mactown out.</i>

390
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,500
Copy that, Mactown.
Over and out.

391
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
Field base to Melbourne. Come in.

392
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,700
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

393
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,700
Whoa! Easy there, team! Easy.

394
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,300
What's up?

395
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,900
I got to do a patch job
on one of the kids.

396
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,400
Radio Katie.
See what's going on with that storm.

397
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,400
All right.

398
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,100
Ah, shoot. Looks like it's Old Jack.

399
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,900
Come here, Jack.

400
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,500
Field base, come in.

401
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,300
- Field base, come in.
- All right.

402
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,200
- We'll get you fixed up.
- Field base?

403
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,500
Got something in your paw?

404
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,000
This is Melbourne team calling.

405
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,000
Field base, can we get a?

406
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
Doc!

407
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,000
Are you OK?

408
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,400
I think I've broken my leg.

409
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,500
All right. All right,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

410
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,700
Whoa!

411
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,700
Whoa! Wait, doc! Don't move!

412
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,100
Doc! Doc!

413
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,200
Doc! Hey! Don't tread water!

414
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Don't tread water!

415
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,500
Look at me! You see the ice? Davis.

416
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Grab the ice!
It'll freeze you to it!

417
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,600
It takes you a lot longer to freeze
than it does to drown!

418
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Good, good!
Davis, hang on! I'm coming down!

419
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,600
All right, kids, come on!

420
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,100
Hang on, doc!

421
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,700
Maya, come here.

422
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,100
I can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

423
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Take deep breaths, doc.

424
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,400
Maya, take the rope.

425
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,000
Go to doc.

426
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,800
She's coming to you, doc.
She's coming to you.

427
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,800
OK, Maya, down.

428
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,300
Good girl. Crawl to the doc.

429
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,200
Come on, Maya, I got you. It's OK.

430
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,700
Come on, doc, stay in there with me.

431
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,800
Come on, Maya.

432
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,500
Easy, Maya. Easy.

433
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
Good girl.

434
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,100
Good job, Maya. Put the line over him.

435
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,600
Good girl. Doc.

436
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
Keep your left arm
on the ice, like it is,

437
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,400
but I want you to reach up
with your right arm.

438
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,300
You gotta get your elbow
and your arm up through the loop.

439
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,300
You can do it. There you go.

440
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Good job, doc. Yeah, just like that.

441
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,200
All right. Maya, come on.

442
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,900
Good girl, Maya. Good girl.

443
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,800
I got you, doc. I got you.

444
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,500
Keep it tight.

445
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,400
Line 'em up, Maya!

446
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,300
Right now! Right now!
Come on! Take it home!

447
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,100
Line up! Hike!

448
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Come on, Maya! Come on, Old Jack!

449
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,900
Come on, kids!

450
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,000
Hike!

451
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,000
All right, doc, you hang in there, OK?

452
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
We're gonna get you home. All right?

453
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,300
Don't you worry.

454
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,300
- I'm gonna get you back.
- I'm sorry.

455
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,700
You're gonna get home
and see your family, doc.

456
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,300
You're gonna see your son, all right?

457
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,200
Come here, Maya.

458
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Maya, you got to get us home!
Get us home!

459
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,200
Go get up there, Max! Maya needs you!

460
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,100
Right now! Right now! Hike! Hike!

461
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
I can fly in this, Andy. You know I can.

462
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,000
Sorry, Katie. It's not a question
of whether you could fly in it,

463
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,400
but whether you could see anything.

464
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,200
Don't worry, hon.
He's been in worse before.

465
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,400
Worse than this?

466
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,800
What?

467
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,200
Base to Melbourne team. Come in?

468
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,400
Base to Melbourne. Come in.

469
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,800
This is Katie. Please, come in.

470
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,700
Jerry, do you copy? Over.

471
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,600
Base out.

472
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,700
Good, kids.

473
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,700
About three here, right?

474
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,300
Andy! Coop! Come on, they're here!

475
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,300
Jerry! Jer, are you all right?

476
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,400
He's got a broken leg!
And he's been in the water!

477
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,400
- Get the stretcher now!
- Got it!

478
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,200
- I don't like that cough.
- Get the dogs.

479
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,600
Look at those hands! Get him in!

480
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,700
- Come on, Jerry.
- Let's go!

481
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,700
Good team. Good team.

482
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,300
Good girl, Maya!

483
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,500
You got us home.

484
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,300
All right,
let's have a look at this leg.

485
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Rosemary. Hypothermia kit.

486
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,600
Put your hands in there.
We'll bring 'em back nice and slow.

487
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,200
Hey. Buddy, how you feeling?

488
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,800
- How are the dogs?
- Uh, good. I just fed them.

489
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,900
- Get the rock off the sled too.
- The rock?

490
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,300
- He found what he was looking for?
- Of course. He had a good guide.

491
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,400
Soon as you can, get that plane ready.

492
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,400
Dr. McClaren could lose this leg
without proper medical attention.

493
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,200
- What are we gonna do about the dogs?
- There's only so much we can carry.

494
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,800
I did speak to Mactown.
The winter team is ready to go.

495
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,200
Katie can fly right back,
bring the dogs out.

496
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,000
I'll wait here and, uh,
I'll fly out with the dogs later.

497
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,700
No, that's out of the question.
That could be stage three frostbite

498
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,600
and heaven knows what nerve damage
has already been done.

499
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,400
Jerry, he's right.
I'll come right back. I promise.

500
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,800
Let's get ready to pull out of here.

501
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,300
Take them out.

502
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,500
Watch his head.
Jer. I need some help.

503
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,400
Be careful with that leg.

504
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,900
Knock down the stretcher,
Rosemary.

505
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,700
Coop. Coop, come help me
tighten the dogs' collars

506
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,400
so they don't get loose.
Come on. Max! Come on!

507
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,300
Good boy, Max.

508
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,900
Come on, buddy. Come here.

509
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,000
Come here, Max. Come here, Max.

510
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,800
- Come here.
- Good boy. Good boy, Max.

511
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,600
- All right. Here we go.
- Won't be long.

512
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,700
Easy, Max. Easy.

513
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,500
- Let's get the other ones.
- All right.

514
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Hang in there, big guy.

515
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,400
That's the last of 'em.

516
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,900
All right, Maya.

517
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,300
You keep 'em in line, all right,
and I'll be back. I promise.

518
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,900
Be good. That's my girl!

519
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,100
All right, buckle tight.
This one's gonna be rough.

520
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,700
- Coop, I know you got that fear...
- Major... major fear of flying? Yeah.

521
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,800
Ugh.

522
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Hey.

523
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,200
Hey!

524
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,500
Finally.

525
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,700
Oh, man.

526
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,600
Oh, you...
you are so lucky you passed out.

527
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
We...

528
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,700
We were bouncing around up there, man,

529
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,400
like one of those beach balls
at Dodger Stadium.

530
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,700
And Katie was yelling at me
the whole time to stop screaming,

531
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,600
but, uh, I couldn't do it.
It was way too intense, man.

532
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,500
It was crazy.

533
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,000
Where is everybody?

534
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,500
Right here.
Everyone's here at Mactown.

535
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,000
Davis is good. Uh, you're good.

536
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,800
Your hands... You still have
your hands, which is good.

537
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,400
Everything's...
everything's all good, man.

538
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
Did Katie get the dogs OK?

539
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,800
Yeah, well, um...

540
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,500
Uh...

541
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,500
Uh... No.

542
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,500
They were telling her
that-that she should wait, maybe,

543
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,800
you know, until things got better.

544
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,900
Jer? It's been snowing
since we got here, man.

545
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,600
Dude...

546
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,900
Hey. You're finally up.

547
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,800
- How are your hands feeling?
- They're fine.

548
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,100
- How soon can we go back?
- I think you should get some rest, OK?

549
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,200
No, Katie. How soon?

550
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,700
The weather's gotten worse.
No one's flying in.

551
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,400
When is it gonna get better?

552
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,900
They've canceled the winter teams.
No one's going in till spring.

553
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,800
I need it now!

554
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,500
Excuse me, commander?

555
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,900
- Who are you?
- Jerry Shepard. I'm with NSF.

556
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,900
- Andy Harrison's crew?
- Yeah.

557
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,300
We need a plane to the field base.
We weren't entirely evacuated.

558
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,000
What? I ordered everybody
out of there yesterday.

559
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,800
No, not everybody.
We left eight dogs there, sir.

560
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,100
Dogs?

561
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,100
I've got over 200 people, ten winter
teams to evacuate to New Zealand.

562
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,700
Right. These dogs
are a part of our team, NSF.

563
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,200
Captain, we've got a big problem
with some of the engines icing up.

564
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,100
- We have to start moving some planes.
- Son, look. This is today.

565
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,000
We've got a two-day window,
then another storm hits.

566
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,200
If it lasts till here,
which they say it will,

567
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,800
then we're into winter
and nobody flies.

568
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,800
We don't have enough supplies
to keep everybody here.

569
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,400
- So I'm a little busy right now.
- All we need is a plane, sir...

570
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,800
- Do you want us to do that, sir?
- Do what?

571
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,700
- Start moving some planes.
- Will you give me one minute?

572
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,000
Listen. If we could just get a plane
like the one that we flew in on,

573
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,000
it would only take three hours.

574
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,500
Son, the only thing
we've got left are C-130s

575
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,000
and they sure as hell
can't land at a field base.

576
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,900
We can't just leave 'em out there.

577
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,000
There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

578
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,600
- Let's start moving those planes.
- Yes, sir, right away, captain.

579
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,100
Yeah, come in.

580
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,700
Hey.

581
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,700
How we doing?

582
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,900
When's your flight leave?
You and Rosie?

583
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,900
A couple hours ahead of you,
Coop and the doc.

584
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,300
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

585
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,200
I'm really sorry, Jerry.

586
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,400
I don't want to talk about it.
You want a drink?

587
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,900
Sure.

588
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,200
- Fresca.
- Yeah, sorry. That's all I got.

589
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,400
You know this wasn't your fault.
This wasn't anybody's fault.

590
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,300
- We just left 'em there.
- Come on. We didn't just leave them.

591
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,500
Don't do this to yourself.
The dogs are strong.

592
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,900
Maybe there's a chance.

593
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,300
We tightened their collars
so they wouldn't get loose.

594
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,300
Listen, I...

595
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,000
I know...

596
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,800
I know you want me to find
a way to get us back there somehow.

597
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,800
I know you're disappointed in me.

598
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,700
No.

599
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,200
You know, sometimes you just
have to lower your expectations.

600
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,600
You know what, Jerry?
I'm sorry. I really am.

601
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,600
I've got to go pack.

602
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,800
Fill this out. Take it down to admin.
Just follow the red line on the floor.

603
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
With any luck, you could
have some funding by August.

604
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,500
August?

605
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,200
No, wait. I don't think you understand.
In a few days those dogs...

606
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,600
I have to go now.

607
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Shepard.
Once winter sets in,

608
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,800
as you know, there's no
coming or goings down there.

609
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,200
We had to cancel
the winter teams this year.

610
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,800
- Couldn't get 'em in before the storm.
- There must be somebody going south.

611
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,900
Mr. Shepard, be reasonable. This is
the biggest Antarctic storm in 25 years.

612
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,300
If you don't believe me,
take a look at this weather report.

613
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,700
Yeah, good, good.

614
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,500
- Where's the rocket going?
- What a surprise!

615
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,300
- To Mars, Dad.
- Come on in.

616
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,900
Yeah?

617
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,600
Well, look who I found.

618
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,800
Hey. Hey, world traveler.

619
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,700
- How you been?
- I'm good, I'm good.

620
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,200
- How's your fingers?
- Oh, I get to keep 'em.

621
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,400
- Great.
- How's the leg?

622
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,500
Hard to tell. The cast is
coming along great, thanks to Eric.

623
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,800
There's a pot of coffee
in the kitchen, so...

624
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,000
Eric, let's go find
a real coloring book.

625
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,200
- What a great surprise.
- Give you a hand?

626
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,800
- No, I'm all right.
- You got it?

627
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,100
So, what brings you to LA?

628
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,300
I brought you something.

629
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,300
Thanks.

630
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,500
I gotta get back there. Right now.

631
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,600
I can't sleep at night. I've been
to NSF, agencies, foundations.

632
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,900
I've been to TV networks to convince
them to follow me with a camera.

633
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,400
Anything to raise money.
It just... It all takes too long.

634
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,000
Now I've only got one week to get
back down there before winter hits.

635
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,600
Then no one gets in for six months.
You've got those guys in your pocket.

636
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,300
The, uh, the science fund guys.

637
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,100
- The university endowment?
- They'd do anything for you right now.

638
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,100
- Jerry, listen to what you're saying.
- No, it would just be me,

639
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,500
just a three-day trip in.
You could tell 'em.

640
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,500
- Tell 'em I'm scouting your next trip.
- They'd be throwing their money away.

641
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,500
- No, they wouldn't.
- Even if you could get down there,

642
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,000
- by now it's 50 below.
- No.

643
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,200
Jerry, be realistic.
It's already been...

644
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,100
I know how long it's been.

645
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,300
But I need to know for sure.
I have to go.

646
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,900
It's not possible, Jerry.

647
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,600
It's just not possible.

648
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,500
And you gotta find a way
to forget about all this.

649
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,300
Forget?

650
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,900
And you can do that?

651
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,400
<i>Hey, Jer. It's Kate.</i>

652
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,800
<i>It's been a week.
Just checking if you're home yet.</i>

653
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,200
<i>Bye.</i>

654
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,700
<i>Jer, it's Kate again.
Call me back. Bye.</i>

655
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,100
Over here.

656
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,100
All right, the ocean
has a mind of its own.

657
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,200
So respect the ocean. Stay alert.

658
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,800
Now, go on ahead and take the paddle
like this, in both hands.

659
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,200
There you go.
We're gonna do an even paddle,

660
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,200
alternating blades.

661
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,200
Like that.

662
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,300
Hey, Al, will you take over for me?

663
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,600
Hey, what are you doing here?

664
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,300
Somebody told me Jerry Shepard
was working at the kiddie pool.

665
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,700
I said, "No way.
I have to see that for myself. "

666
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,000
Is that why you're here?
You're here to mock me?

667
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:52,600
I'm the chauffeur.
Somebody else wanted to see you.

668
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:56,600
Brandy! Come here. Go see Jerry!

669
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Wow.

670
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,500
- Look who's all grown up and beautiful.
- She's smart too. Just like you said.

671
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,100
Is she? Let's see
how well she's got you trained, then.

672
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,300
Go get it!

673
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,000
She's looking good.

674
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,800
But I'm still not sure
what you're doing here.

675
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,100
Come on. You didn't return my calls.
I got worried.

676
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,400
- I've been busy.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.

677
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,200
What about you?
What have you been up to?

678
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,500
Nothing much. I'm seeing somebody.

679
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,200
- Really.
- Yeah, I mean,

680
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,800
I'm not seeing him for long,
but I kind of like him.

681
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,100
He's such the opposite of us.
A complete head guy.

682
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,600
He's an engineer.

683
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,100
Like on a train?

684
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,200
Shut up.

685
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,800
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

686
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,700
Go, Brandy!

687
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,700
So I heard you pulled yourself
off the McKinley expedition.

688
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,000
Listen, I know leaving the dogs
was hard for you.

689
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,400
Well, it is what it is.
There's really nothing to talk about.

690
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,500
Nothing to talk about? Jerry, come on.

691
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,300
I don't want to talk about it.

692
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,100
You can't just keep
hiding out here, Jerry.

693
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,500
I mean, come on.
Renting kayaks to nine-year-olds?

694
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,700
Well, what am I supposed
to do then, huh?

695
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,100
Maybe you can help me out or something
'cause I'm not sure anymore.

696
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,900
You know what you're supposed to do?
Let yourself off the hook.

697
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,100
It doesn't mean that you have to forget.

698
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,500
He knows a dog person
when he smells one.

699
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,600
Hey, Mindo.

700
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,300
- How you doing? Easy trip?
- Yeah, it wasn't bad.

701
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,800
- Appreciate you seeing me.
- My pleasure.

702
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,700
You're part of the family.

703
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,300
Here. I thought you'd like to have this.

704
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,600
Thanks. Come on in.

705
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,400
So, you came to apologize, hmm?

706
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,000
I just knew...

707
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,500
I just knew that you raised 'em.

708
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:25,300
You don't have to apologize to me.
It's not about being sorry for anything.

709
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,000
What is it then?

710
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,200
Back when I was a young man,

711
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,600
my father ran a team of sled dogs
up in the Yukon.

712
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,300
One summer he was out in the bush
walking with six of them.

713
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:51,000
They came across a grizzly bear.
Young, but big.

714
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,800
The first thing he did was maul
my father within an inch of his life.

715
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,300
When he came to,
he saw that two of his dogs

716
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,900
had been killed trying to save him.
The rest were gone.

717
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:07,600
When he regained his strength,
he went out looking for his dogs.

718
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,600
He said he had to.

719
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,100
You know why I told you this story?

720
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,200
Because I won't find my dogs.

721
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,300
The story's not about the dogs.
It's about my father

722
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,700
honoring what the dogs
had done for him.

723
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,500
Jerry, what's important

724
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,800
is finding that one thing
that will truly put your heart at rest.

725
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,500
And now...

726
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,100
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please join with me

727
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,500
in welcoming and honoring
the man who five months ago

728
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,800
brought back from Antarctica
the first documented Mercury meteorite,

729
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,500
Dr. Davis McClaren.

730
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,300
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

731
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,900
Thank you very much. There are
several people I wish to thank,

732
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,400
but first and most important,
my family,

733
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,600
my son, Eric,
and my wife, Dr. Eve McClaren,

734
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,900
for her patience as I travel
around the world on these expeditions,

735
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:07,400
many of which could be better
described as wild-goose chases.

736
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,900
Um, I'd like to thank the university
for its continued support.

737
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,300
I'd also like to take a moment

738
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:19,000
to thank the entire team
at the NSF base,

739
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,900
without whom this discovery

740
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,200
and this scientist
would not have made it home.

741
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:42,000
Thanks. Thanks.
Excuse me one second.

742
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,800
- Thanks.
- Yeah, thanks. Hey.

743
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,000
- There he is.
- Yeah. Scotch, rocks, please.

744
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,400
The man of the hour. Congratulations.

745
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,200
Well, I'm glad you could make it.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come down.

746
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,900
Yeah.

747
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,500
You know, about that...

748
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,000
Last time I saw you,

749
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,100
I tried to make my problems yours.
I shouldn't have done that.

750
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,500
But it was hard to accept
that I couldn't get back to the dogs.

751
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,800
So, where are you with all of that?

752
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,300
Uh...

753
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,000
Actually, I'm heading
to New Zealand later on tonight.

754
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,000
So, you found a way back down?

755
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,300
Part of the way.
I'll make it to Christchurch

756
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,100
and if you hang out there long enough,
usually you can find a ride south.

757
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,600
And if you don't?

758
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,300
Well, it's, uh, like you said
to me the day that storm came in.

759
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,700
You gotta take chances
for things you care about.

760
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,200
Davis?

761
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,600
Yeah, yeah. Just...
I'll be right with you.

762
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,200
Go ahead, get back to the party.

763
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,500
I wanna come in
and say congratulations once again.

764
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,800
- Sure. Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

765
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,000
- Give my best to your family.
- I will. And good luck, really.

766
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,400
Thanks.

767
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,700
Enjoy the evening.

768
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,200
- Sitter says he's been down since 8:00.
- Oh, great.

769
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,600
Which means he'll be up at 5:00.

770
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,300
Hey, little man.

771
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

772
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,300
Is your boat for hire?

773
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,100
- For what?
- I gotta get to McMurdo.

774
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,100
Not a chance, mate.
It's a fishing boat.

775
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,300
Looking for someone, you know Bailies?

776
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,900
- Yeah.
- It's just up there. It's a bar.

777
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,200
- All right, thanks. No chance, huh?
- Not in hell.

778
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,500
You want me to take you
to Antarctica in the dead of winter

779
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,000
on a 70-foot fishing trawler?

780
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,800
Mm-hm. And I can pay you.
Not a lot, but everything I have.

781
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:36,700
I'm sorry, mate. Everybody is looking
for a cheap ride out to McMurdo.

782
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,900
Basically,
my boat's a margarita blender.

783
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,300
First chunk of ice we hit,
we'll break in half.

784
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,200
I've seen your boat. We can make it.

785
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,500
- I'm desperate. You're my last option.
- No one in their right mind

786
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,900
will take you in anything
but an icebreaker.

787
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:52,600
Excuse me, sir.
The lady at the bar bought you a drink.

788
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,900
No way. Excuse me.

789
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,800
What are you doing here?

790
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,900
Ah, some guy needed a cheap pilot
for an expedition

791
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,900
and I'm always cheap in the off season.

792
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,600
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

793
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,700
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

794
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,200
- So, where are you going?
- Same place I'm going.

795
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,300
What the hell?

796
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,000
- What's up, Jer?
- What's going on, buddy?

797
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,000
- Hey, buddy. Aw!
- How you been?

798
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,700
- Nice to see you.
- I missed you.

799
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,800
Same here.

800
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,700
What's really going on?
What kind of expedition is this?

801
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,800
Uh, that'd be an NSF expedition.

802
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,100
Yeah, I had a trip that was cut short.

803
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,700
It turns out I got a couple of weeks
of grant money left and, uh...

804
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,200
- Uh-huh.
- So here we are.

805
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
You're the man. You are the man.

806
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,800
How long you think
it'll take you to pack?

807
01:26:55,800 --> 01:27:00,000
- You know me, I'm always packed.
- Well, this way.

808
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,800
Yeah! Yeah.

809
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,100
Let's go! Let's go!

810
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,700
Come on in, boys.

811
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,500
- Whoo!
- This is crazy. I never expected this.

812
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,900
Sometimes you gotta
raise your expectations.

813
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,300
- Cooper, how you doing?
- I'd rather not talk.

814
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,000
- OK.
- Thanks.

815
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,000
Polarsyssel, this is helicopter
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo

816
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,800
requesting to land on your vessel.

817
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,200
<i>Roger,
Lima-November-Oscar-Mike-Bravo.</i>

818
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,700
<i>- You're clear to land.
- Here we go, boys.</i>

819
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

820
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,200
I thought you might like some company.

821
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,300
Sure.

822
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,400
It's a
good night for stargazing.

823
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,800
Shooting stars
mean good luck, right?

824
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,300
Jerry, you know,

825
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,400
this may not be easy, what we find.

826
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,700
I know that.

827
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,900
But whatever we find,
the dogs deserve this trip.

828
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:36,000
I'm glad you're here, Katie.
And I owe you one.

829
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,600
You owe me for a lot of things.
This is not one of them.

830
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,700
No, I'm serious.

831
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,800
You always understood
why I had to do this.

832
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,300
Careful, Jerry.

833
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,600
You're starting to sound like a grownup.

834
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,900
What about that
conductor friend of yours?

835
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,900
- He's an engineer.
- Oh, yeah.

836
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,500
We're not seeing each other anymore.

837
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,300
That's too bad.

838
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:25,300
Shut her down, Mr. Hansen.
Let's go take a look.

839
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,500
What do you make of that?

840
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,700
It's not good.

841
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,400
The ice
is six feet about here.

842
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,500
The ice is deeper than we thought.

843
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,200
I guess we shouldn't be surprised,
given the winter we just had.

844
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,600
Come halfway around the world
and we can't make it the last 100 miles.

845
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,400
Sorry, mates.

846
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:09,200
I guess now is last call
for a great idea.

847
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:13,100
Simonetta.

848
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,100
Simonetta who?

849
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,500
His imaginary Italian girlfriend.
Come on, not now.

850
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,300
An iceberg, all right,
broke off from an ice shelf.

851
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,100
It blocked the route that the Adlie
penguins take for their fishing waters.

852
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:28,500
- I'm not seeing the relevance.
- Horses, doc. Rein 'em in.

853
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,800
Now, I needed to map the new route
so researchers could find 'em.

854
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:36,900
While I was following them, they
led me right past the Italian base...

855
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,500
...where one Simonetta Pirelli

856
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,200
whipped me up
a mean cup of hot chocolate.

857
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:46,400
- Come on, what are you talking about?
- Step into my office.

858
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:52,000
Our base is too far for the helicopter
to make it there, right?

859
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,900
But the Italian base is,
like, half the distance.

860
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,800
- The young man's right about that.
- Still leaves us short.

861
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,200
Right, right. Hold on. See,

862
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,700
all field bases
have the same basic stuff, right?

863
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,500
But the Italian base is equipped
with the Lamborghini of snowcats.

864
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,800
I'm telling you,
this thing is like a rocket.

865
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:11,200
So we take one of these snowcats
to our base, do what we came to do,

866
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,500
blow out of Dodge.

867
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,600
And this way, I get to spend
a little less time flying.

868
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,300
No offense, Katie.

869
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,900
Huh?

870
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,200
All right, let's go.

871
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,600
Ah! Ah!

872
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,800
Ah, there it is!

873
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,300
The keys are in number two.
The shovels are around the side.

874
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,100
We gotta dig this place out.

875
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,000
It's hard.

876
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,500
Sweet.

877
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,700
All aboard!

878
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:02,100
Nice snowcat, Coop.

879
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,600
What?

880
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,700
Not bad, huh, Jer?

881
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:26,300
Well, what do you want me to say?
You're the man?

882
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,300
That'd be nice.

883
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,000
OK, you're the man.

884
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,900
You are indeed the man, Cooper!
You are the man!

885
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,100
<i>Grazie, Geraldo. Grazie.</i>

886
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,000
And as for you, Crazy Katie,

887
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,200
you know all those ridiculous flights
you put me through?

888
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:45,900
Yeah.

889
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,300
Payback is a dish best served cold.

890
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:52,000
Cooper, I think that's "revenge. "

891
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,000
It's Old Jack.

892
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,300
We came all this way and they
didn't even make it off the chain.

893
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,700
They got off.

894
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,800
They got loose!

895
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:13,300
Come on, kids!

896
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,900
Come on!

897
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,300
Come on, Max!

898
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:36,700
Hey!

899
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,800
Hey, Buck!

900
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,800
Hey, Buck.

901
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,500
Max, what you been doing?

902
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,900
- OK, not the face! Not the face!
- No! You look so beautiful.

903
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,100
OK, chill, boy! Chill, boy, not the...

904
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,700
Good boy, Max. Good boy, Max.

905
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:00,700
- Yeah...
- Told you we'd come back.

906
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,900
Look at you guys. Huh?

907
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,600
Shorty, come here.

908
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:08,700
Not the... Hey, Jer!
A little help over here.

909
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,400
A little help.

910
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,600
Hey, Buck!
Leave him alone! Get over here!

911
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:20,200
Whew! Thank you, Jer!

912
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,400
Good boy, Buck.

913
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:28,100
Shadow, Truman, Max and Shorty.

914
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,500
Man, I don't believe it.

915
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,600
Good boys.

916
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:35,700
My five lucky stars.

917
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,400
Almost perfect.

918
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,800
Let's go home, kids. Come on.

919
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,700
This should be enough
to get us home.

920
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,700
- Give me a hand with this.
- OK.

921
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,300
All right, Shorty, up!

922
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,900
Good boy! Come on, Shadow, let's go.

923
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:15,600
Come on, buddy.
Come on, let's go. Get in the back.

924
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,000
Come on! We're losing light here.
Party's over, come on.

925
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,800
All right, Max, come on, buddy.

926
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,000
- Wanna ride up front?
- Have it your way.

927
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,500
Let's go. Up front. Ride with me.

928
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,200
Come on, buddy. Jump up.

929
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:32,800
Max! Max!

930
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,700
Max!

931
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:51,200
Maya.

932
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,300
Aw, Maya.

933
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,300
Come on now.

934
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:25,900
Come on now.

935
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,800
You did good.

936
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,600
You did good, Max. Good boy.

937
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:35,900
You brought her home.

938
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,600
I'm sorry, girl.

939
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,800
Maya?

940
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,100
Hey.

941
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,000
There's my girl.

942
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
You're OK.

943
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,200
How's my best girl doing, huh?

944
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:24,400
Good girl, Maya.
All right, let's get you home, OK?

945
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,000
Let's get you home.

946
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,000
Coop. Coop.

947
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:59,100
- She gonna be OK?
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

948
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:04,100
What do you say, Coop?
Let's fire her up and get out of here.

949
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:06,800
Yes, sir. I'll just make room
for one more.

950
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:08,100
All right.

951
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:11,100
Give me a hand here, Katie.
Let's get her in.

952
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,900
Come here, Maya.

953
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,800
- Got her? There you go.
- I think so.

954
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:22,500
All right, Max. Let's go, buddy.

955
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:26,100
Come on. Good boy.

956
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:36,800
How's your girl?

957
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:43,100
She's good.

958
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,400
All right. Here we go.

959
