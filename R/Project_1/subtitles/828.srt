2
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,493
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

3
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,336
Private Miller...

4
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,547
...you've been smoking ltem 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

5
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,674
We're going to ask you
several questions.

6
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,842
How do you feel?

7
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,261
Well' sir...

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,180
...I feel like a...

9
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,391
Like a slice of butter...

10
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:47,981
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

11
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,610
Yeah.

12
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,155
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

13
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,200
...what emotions do you feel?

14
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,875
Okay, Private Miller?

15
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,547
Is this normal?

16
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,382
Okay, Private...

17
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,301
Okay, Private Miller?

18
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,053
Private Miller.

19
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,100
Answer the question.

20
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,399
This went out' sir.

21
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,235
Can you torch me?

22
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,028
We'll send someone in.

23
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,365
Holy bejesus!

24
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,915
Private Miller' answer the question.

25
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,625
What was the question again' sir?

26
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:53,255
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

27
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,174
You know what problem I have...

28
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,677
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

29
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,222
Here it is. One: Lots of dudes.

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,807
Where are the boobies?

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,436
Two: Why are We
underground right now, sir?

32
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,772
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

33
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,276
Why aren't we talking to people'
letting them know ltem 9 exists?

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,987
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

35
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,658
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees' ltem 9!"

36
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,493
Private, we need you to be serious.

37
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,414
I'm serious. Your dick' my mouth.

38
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,253
That's inappropriate.

39
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,554
Fuck you!

40
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,391
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

41
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,145
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

42
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,647
This never happened.

43
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,440
Dude, what happened to your eye?

44
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,651
Hello.

45
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,986
Can you guys understand me?

46
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,031
- Hey. Hey' where we going?
- This is General Brat.

47
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,992
We've reached
a final conclusion on ltem 9.

48
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,245
Illegal!

49
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,871
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.

50
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,206
Welcome to KRAD.

51
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,334
You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.

52
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,170
Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.

53
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,256
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

54
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,759
- Here's my piece.
- All right.

55
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,679
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

56
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,932
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,934
Everyone likes smoking weed.

58
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,521
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

59
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,856
It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.

60
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,359
It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.

61
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,362
It makes shitty movies better,
you know?

62
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,665
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

63
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,874
Yeah.

64
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,671
Well' I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,089
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

66
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,466
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,429
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

68
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,098
- Oh' great. Thanks a lot' asshole.
- Sorry.

69
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,851
I'm just saying love has no age.

70
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,229
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

71
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,356
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

72
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,899
I'm dating a high-school girl.

73
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,820
You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?

74
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,365
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

75
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,576
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

76
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,871
- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.

77
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,999
Yo, you been served.

78
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,586
You've been served.
You've been served.

79
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,838
You've been served.

80
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,930
Walter Wadska the third.

81
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,433
You here to fix the fax machine?

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,853
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

83
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,397
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

84
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,448
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

85
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,832
- Hey' "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,212
- Take that shit to the next level' eh?
- Okay, I will.

87
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,267
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

88
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,937
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

89
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,147
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

90
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,900
And noW because of that'
you've been served.

91
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,151
You're a jerk.

92
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,320
All this current system is doing...

93
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,739
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

94
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,618
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

95
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,247
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible' it's weird, it's awkward.

96
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,416
They think they're your friend'
but they're not.

97
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,545
Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.

98
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,976
I can't come.

99
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,353
What?

100
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,522
Why the fuck not' Dale?

101
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,023
I just... Look, I can't come.

102
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,943
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

103
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,280
Jesus Christ' Dale.
When Were you gonna tell me?

104
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,990
My mom has been shopping all day.

105
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,033
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

106
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,203
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

107
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,372
- How I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

108
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,250
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

109
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,877
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

110
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,503
Don't come. I don't care.

111
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,965
Then Why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

112
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,384
If you don't wanna meet them'
I don't want you to.

113
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,180
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

114
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,849
I just know they'll like you' that's all.

115
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,185
You're great' and you're funny...

116
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,228
...and you're sexy.

117
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,856
I just want them to see that.

118
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,692
- You Want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey' people?

119
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,402
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

120
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,571
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

121
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,741
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

122
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,911
- I'm with her' actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

123
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,373
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

124
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,875
What's that supposed to mean?

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,670
I'm just wondering Why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

126
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,797
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,549
- Angie' hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,515
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

131
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,558
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

132
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,269
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

133
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,938
I wish.

134
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,690
Oh' hey' I almost forgot.

135

Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

159
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

160
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,961
I'm not a student'
so I can say whatever I Want...

161
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,380
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.

You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

163
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,176
...or I call the liaison officer.

00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,513
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

168
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,981
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

169
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,026
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

170
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,069
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

171
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,614
Yeah, I Wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

172
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,532
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

173
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,534
That means so much to me
and my parents.

174
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,704
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

175
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,875
- Hello?
- Hey' Saul. Mind if I come by?

176
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,070
- Come on down.
- Sweet. Be there.

177
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,905
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

178
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:34,700
I thought the hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,535
I thought hurricane season
was over.

180
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,495
I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand.

181
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:41,039
Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.

182
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,919
Hello? Hey' man.

183
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,838
What the fuck' man?

184
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,632
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

185
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,969
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when l...

186
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,263
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

187
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,056
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

188
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,267
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

189
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:03,937
I don't knoW. I'm sorry about that.
I don't knoW your protocol yet.

190
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,356
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

191
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:09,484
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

192
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:11,653
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

193
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:14,030
Yo, check this out.

194
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,119
Satellite radio.

195
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:22,247
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

196
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,707
That's home entertainment.

197
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,085
You're very entertained.
Oh' wow. You got a cute picture too.

198
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,379
Oh' yeah. Me and my bubbe.

199
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,465
Hey, let me ask you something.

200
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:32,966
Yeah?

201
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:37,345
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

202
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,598
Like, euthanasia?

203
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:43,769
Like, on her?

204
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,771
If I needed to.

205
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,735
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

206
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,571
I don't knoW if we should
start going down that road.

207
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,699
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

208
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,409
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

209
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,912
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

210
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,497
Business for the businessman.

211
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,791
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

212
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,375
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

213
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:10,962
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,006
Hands down'
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

215
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:16,259
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

216
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:21,097
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

217
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:22,724
...and they had a baby.

218
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,727
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

219
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:29,564
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

220
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:33,193
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

221
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:36,571
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

222
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,074
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

223
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,534
- Smell it.
- Okay.

224
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:43,036
Smell it. Enjoy.

225
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:46,373
It's like God's vagina.

226
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,376
What, you wanna bathe in it?

227
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,419
- I wanna live in here.
- You Wanna be it?

228
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:54,714
My God' I just wanna shove it
up my nose' have that smell all day.

229
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,967
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

230
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,426
Beautiful. What's it called?

231
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,720
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

232
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,889
It's this thing, like' El Nino.

233
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:06,059
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

234
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:09,104
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

235
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:11,606
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

236
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,442
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

237
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,194
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

238
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,071
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

239
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,240
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

240
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,741
Let me get my scale.

241
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,287
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

242
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,249
I thought hurricane season
was over.

243
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,502
Oh' crow.

244
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:37,632
Where are you' you little fucker?

245
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,262
What the fuck is this thing?

246
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:44,931
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

247
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,434
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

248
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:48,685
- Yeah, man.
- No.

249
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,937
This is the future.

250
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:55,942
This is, like' the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

251
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,362
It's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

252
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,115
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

253
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,534
My second favorite civil engineer...

254
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:08,580
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

255
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,542
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

256
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,962
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

257
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,216
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

258
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:23,637
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

259
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:25,805
Future. The future.

260
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:28,516
That's amazing.
Well' got the weed?

261
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:31,603
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

262
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,690
Be careful with that thing' man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

263
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,651
Alrighty' man, thanks.
Have a good one.

264
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,611
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

265
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,905
Well' hey' wait a minute' man.

266
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:43,823
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

267
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:45,825
I really... I can't' man. I gotta...

268
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:48,119
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

269
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:51,206
Yeah, I need your help' man.

270
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:53,667
- I'm in.
- Come on!

271
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:56,628
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

272
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,672
Why not? What do I do?

273
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,006
Okay, here's What you do.

274
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:01,883
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

275
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,468
- Equip me' sir.
- Okay.

276
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:08,515
You are going to light these tWo ends
while I light this end.

277
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,433
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

278
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:13,478
- Ready.
- Blast off.

279
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:32,205
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

280
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,719
It's better to cough.

281
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,429
It's like...

282
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,222
Makes you 10 times more higher...

283
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,641
...than the cross Weed
and the Pineapple Express.

284
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,603
You're like'
totally fucking Gong Show'ed, man.

285
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,951
Oh' fuck.

286
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,578
Hang on one second, man.

287
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,787
Oh' you fucker.

288
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,960
Who is it?

289
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,962
It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.

290
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,338
Shit.

291
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,090
What's a Gebert?

292
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,842
Come on up.

293
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,345
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

294
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:33,892
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

295
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,187
Hey.

296
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,355
So listen, man.

297
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:41,941
I gotta ask you. So...

298
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:46,071
Listen' man. You've been buying
from me for, like, tWo months' right?

299
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,531
- Two months.
- I gotta ask' man.

300
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,241
What's up with the suit?

301
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,203
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

302
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,749
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

303
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:01,127
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No' I'm not...

304
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:04,380
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

305
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,049
- I like...
- In process.

306
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:08,176
I work for a company
that's, like' hired...

307
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,345
...by laWyers to hand out
legal documents.

308
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,639
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

309
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:16,643
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

310
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:19,062
...so I can serve them the papers.

311
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,271
Disguise.

312
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,564
Kind of, I guess.

313
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:23,775
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

314
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:28,113
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today' I' like, sat in my car...

315
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,739
...I smoked, like' 10 doobies...

316
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,408
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

317
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,202
Nice.

318
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,830
What? You sucked on her titties?

319
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:40,041
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

320
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,710
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

321
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:45,004
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

322
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,924
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

323
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,926
She's cool as hell, actually.

324
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:51,845
- You'd get along With her.
- Really?

325
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:54,722
Yeah, you knoW, it only sucks...

326
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,643
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

327
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,229
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

328
00:18:01,397 --> 00:18:04,274
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

329
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:09,445
And' like, I just feel like a fat, dumb'
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

330
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,823
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

331
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,367
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

332
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,203
You know, don't get doWn on yourself.
You got a great girl.

333
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,789
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

334
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,083
You get to smoke weed all day.

335
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:23,626
I wish I had that.

336
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:27,130
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

337
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,383
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

338
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:33,011
You didn't think of that.

339
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,221
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

340
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:36,639
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

341
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,433
Thank you.

342
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:41,728
Oh' shit. All right. Business.

343
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,731
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

344
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,399
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

345
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,985
He sees that' he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

346
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:52,363
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

347
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,865
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

348
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,325
All right, homes. Good.

349
00:18:55,492 --> 00:18:57,619
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

350
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,746
You got the dough? There you go.

351
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:02,081
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you' Mark.

352
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,626
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

353
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:07,128
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

354
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,338
- Chris.
- Chris.

355
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,256
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

356
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:12,926
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

357
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,303
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well' I...

358
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,388
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

359
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,433
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

360
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:21,851
- Thank...
- God.

361
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,020
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

362
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:26,022
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

363
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,565
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

364
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,234
Fuck.

365
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:31,945
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

366
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:35,740
If there's one quality
I hate in a person' it's lingering.

367
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,618
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

368
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:42,038
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

369
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,290
...and process and service?

370
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,960
I don't knoW. It's alWays
something different' I guess.

371
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:48,419
This guy...

372
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,297
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

373
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,716
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

374
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:57,679
My guy' Red, who I buy from'
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

375
00:19:57,846 --> 00:19:59,764
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

376
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,974
That'd be weird.

377
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:03,685
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

378
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:07,397
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

379
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:09,899
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

380
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:12,694
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

381
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,905
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

382
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:19,200
That sounds appealing, but I think
I should probably just get going.

383
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:20,785
- Oh' that sucks.
- Yeah.

384
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,246
That's cool' man.
What are you doing this weekend?

385
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:26,332
Because, you know, my bubbe's
got season tickets to the opera...

386
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,669
...and she can't make it'
so wanna go see Phantom?

387
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,714
- Of the Opera?
- Yeah.

388
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:36,342
I can't this weekend'
but you know what? Here.

389
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,221
You know... I'll run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by' hang out.

390
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,182
- We'll watch 227 and shit.
- Definitely.

391
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,226
Cool, man. Well' thanks.
Good to see you.

392
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,561
- Peace' brother.
- Okay.

393
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,229
One love.

394
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:50,567
When you got behind
on the mortgage...

395
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:52,527
...someone finally
made you a loan?

396
00:20:52,695 --> 00:20:53,778
Yes, he did.

397
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,573
Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you gotu

398
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:01,328
- It was 12 or 13 percent.
- That's disgusting.

399
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,839
- Hello?
- Hello.

400
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,633
Hey, Angie' what's happening?

401
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,261
I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.

402
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,598
Like, so excited. And so am I,
but we're all really excited.

403
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:22,766
Thank you so much.

404
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:25,268
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

405
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:29,105
Couscous. The food so nice'
they named it twice.

406
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:33,985
Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over.

407
00:21:34,153 --> 00:21:37,072
Oh' shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

408
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,157
Fucking cops. Shit.

409
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:48,083
Jesus.

410
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:55,298
What an adorable little cop.

411
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,384
Weird.

412
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,807
Jesus. Fuck.

413
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:05,976
What the fuck was that?

414
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:07,435
Oh' shit.

415
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:11,273
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

416
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,482
Oh' no!

417
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,622
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

418
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,791
I don't knoW,
but I ain't waiting to see.

419
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,698
Pineapple Express.

420
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,827
Oh' my God! Oh, my God!
Oh' my God! Oh, my God!

421
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:07,495
I saW brains and blood!

422
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,122
Come on! Come on!

423
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,373
Where do I go?

424
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:27,807
Hello?

425
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:29,726
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

426
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:32,354
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

427
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:35,315
- It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man?
- Dale?

428
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:38,109
Yes, Dale. That's what I said.
It's Dale. Let me in.

429
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:40,362
Oh' all right' man. Come on up.

430
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,534
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

431
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,536
Buzz it in three seconds exactly.

432
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:51,164
One, two...

433
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:53,375
- Did it work?
- On three!

434
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:56,378
I did it on three.
On "one' two' three, go"?

435
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:58,296
Just on three.

436
00:24:08,557 --> 00:24:10,892
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey' I got neighbors.

437
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,519
He fucking killed him.

438
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:15,647
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

439
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:18,942
A cop' a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

440
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,111
No, it was just a guy.

441
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:22,946
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

442
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:27,784
A woman. A policeWoman and a guy'
another guy' shot another guy...

443
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:30,954
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

444
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:32,705
Whoa' was the other guy Ted?

445
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:34,958
I don't knoW.
He was a big' gray-haired man...

446
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:36,876
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

447
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,963
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

448
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:41,589
What?

449
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:45,051
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

450
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,636
You threw up on my printer.

451
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:48,138
- I did.
- Did you break it?

452
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:50,223
- I hope not.
- Listen' man.

453
00:24:50,391 --> 00:24:51,891
I think the guy was Ted.

454
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,893
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

455
00:24:54,061 --> 00:24:55,979
...so you saW Ted
capping the competition.

456
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:57,981
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

457
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:59,816
What? They saw you?

458
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:01,317
And you fucking came here?

459
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:03,486
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

460
00:25:03,654 --> 00:25:07,907
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

461
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:10,785
I saW them kill him.

462
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:13,663
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

463
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:15,999
I tossed my roach.

464
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,626
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

465
00:25:18,794 --> 00:25:21,921
So they must have heard...
They knoW someone was out there.

466
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,215
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

467
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:27,010
They don't know it was you. Right?

468
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:30,597
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

469
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,348
- Yes.
- I hope not.

470
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:33,558
Relax.

471
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:38,521
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed knoWn to mankind.

472
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,525
Is it really that rare?

473
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,028
It's' like, the rarest.

474
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,697
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

475
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:51,826
It's like killing a unicorn...

476
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:53,703
...with, like, a bomb.

477
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,166
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

478
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:00,460
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

479
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:04,214
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

480
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:07,467
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

481
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:10,720
Yeah. So We're, like' the only guys.

482
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:12,722
And Red got this from Ted?

483
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,224
Ted's the man.

484
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:17,936
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

485
00:26:18,103 --> 00:26:20,438
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

486
00:26:20,606 --> 00:26:22,607
So what? I throw roaches
all over toWn.

487
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:26,194
No. He could find the roach
and say' "It's Pineapple Express.

488
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:28,571
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

489
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,823
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

490
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,408
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

491
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,411
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

492
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,748
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food' Fruit Roll-Ups.

493
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,042
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

494
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:02,272
Red said he'd be here.

495
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:12,240
Them some drugs.

496
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,949
Smells like vomit in this house.

497
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:17,992
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

498
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,328
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

499
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:22,163
Smell it on my sweater.

500
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:23,790
For real?

501
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,250
Yeah, for real.

502
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:28,211
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

503
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,462
Not my style.

504
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,965
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

505
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:34,592
You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

506
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,386
- Ted.
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.

507
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,347
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

508
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,560
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew We Were coming.

509
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:44,852
They not here, Ted.

510
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,729
Hi, Ted.

511
00:27:47,314 --> 00:27:49,607
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

512
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:51,651
I think he's crazy about murdering.

513
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,153
Jesus, man.
Well' how much money do you have?

514
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:57,490
- I have, like' the 75 that you gave me.
- That's it?

515
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:59,534
- Well' hoW much do you have?
- Three bucks.

516
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:02,287
What you getting on my case for?
I have more than you.

517
00:28:02,454 --> 00:28:06,207
Well' that's my 75 technically.
So I have $78 and you have nothing.

518
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:10,753
I don't knoW. Let's just go... Go to
a motel or a hotel and just hide out.

519
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:14,507
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

520
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:18,678
Shit. I wish We could
just go nowhere.

521
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:21,973
Okay.

522
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:27,854
Even if he found that roach,
how could he knoW where you are?

523
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:31,149
Heat-seeking missiles.

524
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,985
Bloodhounds.

525
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:36,571
Foxes.

526
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,364
Barracudas.

527
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:41,743
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's Weird.

528
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,952
Thank you.

529
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,163
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

530
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,248
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

531
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:51,628
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

532
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:55,131
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

533
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:57,175
Only Red knows, man.

534
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:58,760
Who is Red?

535
00:28:58,927 --> 00:29:02,597
Red's' like, the middleman
between' like, Ted and me.

536
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,849
And we're, like'
mad fucking tight, man.

537
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:07,101
One time, he got this girl...

538
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,688
...to give me a hand job, like'
within five minutes of meeting her.

539
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:15,401
It was like' "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

540
00:29:15,778 --> 00:29:20,740
That is pretty rad, but, like'
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

541
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:23,076
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

542
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:25,870
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

543
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:28,748
No. Oh' no. Fuck that, man.

544
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:32,502
Fucking hand job' Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

545
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,506
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

546
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,133
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

547
00:29:41,136 --> 00:29:44,931
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

548
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:48,226
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

549
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:52,355
You know? Just ignore What I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

550
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:54,148
See what the dealio is.

551
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:59,654
- Hello.
- Hey, Red, you okay?

552
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:02,949
Yeah, Saul. Yeah' I'm fine' man.
I just stubbed my toe.

553
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:06,119
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

554
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:09,288
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now' listen.

555
00:30:09,456 --> 00:30:11,958
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

556
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,794
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

557
00:30:14,962 --> 00:30:16,254
I'd never talk to anyone...

558
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:20,633
...about the stuft that I do with you
involving drugs.

559
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,302
All right, cool.
Listen' I'm gonna come by.

560
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,304
I gotta lay some shit on you.

561
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:27,098
There is a fly in the ointment.

562
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,809
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

563
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:32,311
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

564
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,981
- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- Perfect.

565
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:38,151
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

566
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:40,778
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

567
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:43,364
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

568
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:44,574
- Who?
- I don't know.

569
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,367
He's whispering to another man.

570
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,370
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

571
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:53,040
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

572
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,626
- Hey.
- So you're coming by tomorrow?

573
00:30:55,794 --> 00:30:56,836
How'd you know that?

574
00:30:57,004 --> 00:31:00,882
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

575
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:03,676
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen' I can't go in the morning...

576
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:06,679
...because my bubbe... Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

577
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:09,348
Is that the bubbe
that's on 41 st and River Street?

578
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:11,934
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

579
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:14,729
You got it. So, listen'
we'll be chilling by noon.

580
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:18,024
- Noon it is' bromosexual.
- Nice.

581
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:20,860
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

582
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:23,696
Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up.

583
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:27,158
Definitely. All right' peace, brother.

584
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,202
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

585
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:31,245
- Why'd he mention a casino?
- I don't know.

586
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:34,207
You make me call my good
friend' send him into a booby trap.

587
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:36,042
- And lie to him.
- Is Saul Asian?

588
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,211
- Making me a shitty person.
- Is he Asian?

589
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,754
- He's not Asian.
- You're lying.

590
00:31:39,922 --> 00:31:42,465
- I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
- You're lying.

591
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,175
Did you hear slot machines?

592
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:46,969
- Man' I don't know where he is.
- You tell me Where he is.

593
00:31:47,137 --> 00:31:50,014
Tell me. In 45 minutes,
I gotta go have dinner with my wife.

594
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:51,766
- I got a reservation.
- Forty-five?

595
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:54,101
That's a dinner reservation
you gonna miss.

596
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:55,728
That's a reservation I'll make.

597
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:58,314
- I don't think so.
- Because if he doesn't start to...

598
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:02,568
- Look, can you do this one solo?
- No, I can't do this solo. Are you crazy?

599
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:06,364
- What are you talking about? What?
- What, you trying to abandon me?

600
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:09,617
This is teamwork. This is a
partnership. We are in this together.

601
00:32:09,785 --> 00:32:11,410
- You want me to stay?
- Yes.

602
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:12,912
- Fine, I'll stay.
- Thank you.

603
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,081
- You happy now?
- Yes.

604
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,542
There's no way that
we could pause for a minute...

605
00:32:17,709 --> 00:32:19,043
...you guys go home...

606
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:22,338
...and then tomorrow we
could just' like, continue?

607
00:32:27,096 --> 00:32:29,264
I should call Angie soon.

608
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:32,475
Make up some bullshit.

609
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:33,726
I'm cold.

610
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:36,980
You're cold?
Oh' I'm not cold at all. Here.

611
00:32:37,147 --> 00:32:38,147
I run hot.

612
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:39,649
- Really?
- Yeah.

613
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:43,111
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

614
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,489
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that' but it's okay.

615
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:48,908
I'm gonna call Angie.

616
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,166
Space.

617
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:00,753
Dale, wait. Wait.

618
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,507
The phones. The phones.

619
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:06,968
- You said they Were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

620
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:08,678
I was thinking' maybe they can...

621
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:11,597
...triangulate these things' man'
or, like' trace them.

622
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,683
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

623
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:15,685
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right' man.

624
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:17,520
Maybe they can even trace them...

625
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:20,148
...like' when We're not even
on them' you know?

626
00:33:20,316 --> 00:33:23,818
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

627
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,945
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

628
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:27,572
We'll never catch an animal.

629
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,199
The squirrel'd be up in a tree'
they'd think we were.

630
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,993
No, no, no.

631
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:34,537
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

632
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,080
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

633
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,665
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

634
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,752
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

635
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,129
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

636
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,967
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

637
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:50,345
- What tree?
- That one.

638
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:53,056
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

639
00:33:53,223 --> 00:33:56,059
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

640
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:58,186
Did you at least see
where it landed?

641
00:33:58,354 --> 00:33:59,979
I don't knoW. Call it.

642
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:03,858
Call it? With What?
My phone has been smashed.

643
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,653
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

644
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:11,282
Well' you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

645
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,077
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

646
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,371
- Do you see it?
- See What?

647
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,790
The phone, you idiot.

648
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,751
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

649
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,212
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

650
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,131
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

651
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,300
- What?
- What was that?

652
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,551
- What?
- What is that?

653
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,596
- What?
- I hear something.

654
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:34,806
What?

655
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,849
I don't knoW. Do you hear that?

656
00:34:37,017 --> 00:34:39,394
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

657
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,312
Oh' fuck!

658
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,857
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

659
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:48,444
Help me!

660
00:34:49,446 --> 00:34:50,947
Tell him to get aWay from me!

661
00:34:51,115 --> 00:34:53,282
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

662
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,284
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

663
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:59,122
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

664
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,040
- Fall back!
- Save me!

665
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:15,221
Oh' shit.

666
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:18,266
Car.

667
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,609
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

668
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:31,028
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

669
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,489
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

670
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:37,326
- Go! I saw something!
- Go! What did you see? Shut up!

671
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:40,997
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

672
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,458
I heard something,
then I saw something.

673
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,334
You didn't hear anything' man.

674
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:47,336
Well' I saw something.

675
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:54,510
And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...

676
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,053
...broke your nose?
- Right.

677
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:00,141
The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?

678
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:17,158
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

679
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:20,119
How did I get on you?

680
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:22,538
I wonder.

681
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:28,419
Watch finally broke.

682
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,213
Crazy. What time is it?

683
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:35,343
That can't be right.

684
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,679
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

685
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,932
It's 3:00 right now?

686
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,642
Holy shit, man!

687
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:46,312
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

688
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,939
No, it's daylight-savings' so...

689
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,108
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh' no' it went forWard an hour.

690
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:55,571
It's 4 o'-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No' man. That's bad.

691
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:58,908
Shit. We slept for' like, 18 hours.

692
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:01,619
My bubbe...
Man' my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.

693
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:02,870
Shit.

694
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:04,872
We gotta call Red.

695
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,625
Okay. Now?

696
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:09,835
We'll go to a pay phone.

697
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:13,256
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

698
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:15,424
Great. Well' do you remember
where he lives?

699
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:16,926
Yeah, I know where he lives.

700
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,220
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

701
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:20,805
"Insinuating." Good word.

702
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:22,265
Do you know what that means?

703
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:25,434
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like' "to seem like."

704
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:30,398
Let's roll. I'm done With the woods.
Let's go.

705
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,567
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

706
00:37:32,734 --> 00:37:36,612
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

707
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,447
Wait.

708
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:40,741
What do you mean, it's dead?

709
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:44,453
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

710
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:46,289
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

711
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,958
How can I explain this
to you differently?

712
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:52,128
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

713
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:55,798
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

714
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:58,718
How did this happen?

715
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,637
Well' we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on' and...

716
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:03,764
Oh' man. To talk radio?

717
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,309
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring' man.

718
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:09,270
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

719
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:11,564
Shut up' man. I have an idea noW.

720
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:12,982
We're gonna go.

721
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,860
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

722
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,987
Someone will pick us up'
take us to Red's.

723
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:21,365
Red Will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

724
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,825
How does that sound? Good?

725
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:24,827
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

726
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:27,580
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

727
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:29,790
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

728
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,635
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

729
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:43,179
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

730
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:45,264
Thanks for taking care of it.

731
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:28,307
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

732
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:33,979
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

733
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,988
Here's good.

734
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:50,579
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

735
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:52,331
You're welcome.

736
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:59,839
- You're sure We can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

737
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:01,632
Who is it?

738
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,469
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

739
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,806
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

740
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,015
Who's this?

741
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:12,143
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

742
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,352
Dale who?

743
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,479
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

744
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,939
Dale Denton. He's with me.

745
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:19,442
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you' bro.

746
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:22,319
- Hold on. Let me get this lock' okay?
- You better.

747
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:24,780
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

748
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:27,658
- Y'all Wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

749
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:29,910
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

750
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:31,996
Look at that, huh?

751
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,416
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

752
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,212
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

753
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,797
What's up with the clothes?

754
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,842
We were camping.

755
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,469
- Camping?
- Yeah.

756
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:49,722
Is your lip okay' man?

757
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,932
- You been crying?
- Oh' my lip.

758
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:54,059
It's a cold sore.

759
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:57,646
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

760
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:01,025
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

761
00:41:01,193 --> 00:41:03,778
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

762
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:06,447
Yeah. Yes, it does.

763
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:09,450
Fucking sick' man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

764
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:12,328
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

765
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:13,996
Herpes is for life, bro.

766
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:17,666
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

767
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:20,461
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

768
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:22,338
It's from that time. I told you, man.

769
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,883
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

770
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,719
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

771
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:32,181
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

772
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:35,810
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

773
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:38,646
Dudes' seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

774
00:41:38,814 --> 00:41:43,025
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

775
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:44,944
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

776
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:46,362
Can I have a piece of thatu

777
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,823
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

778
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,491
No, you can't. This is private.

779
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,409
Do you know what today is?

780
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,538
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

781
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:58,874
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

782
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,001
No, because he died
three months ago' okay?

783
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:02,503
So now who's the funny guy?

784
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:03,838
Sorry.

785
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,089
Today is his birthday...

786
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:08,592
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

787
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,054
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

788
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:14,557
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

789
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:16,392
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

790
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,686
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

791
00:42:18,854 --> 00:42:20,062
What are we talk...? Guys...

792
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,730
Ask him. Just ask him' okay?

793
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:24,024
Ask What? Just come straight.
What's up?

794
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:26,193
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

795
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,320
We need to know...

796
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:30,239
We need to know
about your source.

797
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:31,740
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

798
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:35,578
See' Dale' here,
is a protest servant.

799
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:37,204
I'm not. That's not what I am.

800
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:40,499
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

801
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:45,671
Don't... Look' we don't want
to bring you in to What we're in' okay?

802
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,591
You don't Want any trouble.
We don't Wanna give you trouble.

803
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:51,176
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

804
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:54,221
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

805
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:56,265
- You can.
- I totally can.

806
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,225
And for you
to come into my house...

807
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:01,604
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

808
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:04,481
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

809
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,900
Look at this. See this?

810
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,861
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

811
00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:10,487
What's the significance of that?

812
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,449
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

813
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:17,328
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

814
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:19,955
That's all we need to know.

815
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:24,627
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

816
00:43:24,794 --> 00:43:26,795
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

817
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:29,882
Cleared. Over.

818
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,009
Everything's fine. I told you' bro.

819
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,844
We had a Wacky night
in the woods...

820
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,639
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

821
00:43:36,806 --> 00:43:38,933
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

822
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,559
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

823
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:42,061
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

824
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:43,938
Yes.

825
00:43:44,356 --> 00:43:45,648
There you go.

826
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:47,816
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

827
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:50,110
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

828
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:52,821
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

829
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:54,239
You're more chill than me?

830
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:56,951
Look at what I'm Wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

831
00:43:57,118 --> 00:43:58,994
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

832
00:43:59,162 --> 00:44:02,373
I don't knoW what's up with you,
but I don't knoW if I like you.

833
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,667
Well' I don't know
if I like you either' man.

834
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:07,169
Well' that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

835
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:10,089
I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?

836
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:11,423
- Give her a call.
- I will.

837
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:12,218
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

838
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:13,303
- Go ahead.
- Sit on my couch...

839
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,555
...my chillastic couch, and chill out.

840
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:18,433
- I'm chilling right here.
- Don't listen to what I'm saying.

841
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,935
- This is private. This is my wife.
- I'm listening.

842
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,313
I'm not trying to be enemies.
I don't wanna be.

843
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,148
- I wanna be friends.
- Well' then good.

844
00:44:25,316 --> 00:44:26,941
- I wanna be best friends.
- Come here.

845
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:29,360
- Shake my fucking hand.
- Shake my hand. Okay.

846
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:31,487
- See' we can be friends.
- I'm feeling it.

847
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:34,866
- You feel that? We can be best friends.
- I'm looking through you, man.

848
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:36,451
I'm looking through you too...

849
00:44:36,618 --> 00:44:39,412
...and I see I need to paint
the spot on the wall behind you.

850
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,331
- I'm looking through you.
- Transparent.

851
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:45,168
- I see your intentions.
- I see your intestines and intentions.

852
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:48,504
- What'd I have for dinner last night?
- Cake.

853
00:44:48,797 --> 00:44:50,798
I'll be right back.
Make this phone call.

854
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:54,302
Bullshit.

855
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:56,845
No, no, no.

856
00:44:57,013 --> 00:44:58,513
- Liar.
- What are you doing' man?

857
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:01,141
He's a liar. He's lying to us' man.
He's lying to us.

858
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:02,309
No, he's not.

859
00:45:02,476 --> 00:45:04,352
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

860
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,479
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

861
00:45:06,647 --> 00:45:09,107
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

862
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:10,525
I do not trust you, sir.

863
00:45:10,693 --> 00:45:12,444
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

864
00:45:12,612 --> 00:45:14,613
Red' I'm sorry' bro.

865
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,364
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

866
00:45:16,532 --> 00:45:17,699
Fuck you!

867
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:19,534
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

868
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:20,994
Oh' Jesus.

869
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:25,081
Herpes!

870
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:27,375
I don't wanna have to do this.

871
00:45:27,543 --> 00:45:28,710
Red' you're crazy' man.

872
00:45:28,878 --> 00:45:30,879
You brought the devil
into my house.

873
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:32,756
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

874
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:35,008
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

875
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:39,179
Dale, he's hurting me!

876
00:45:39,347 --> 00:45:40,889
Toilet.

877
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:42,557
Flush.

878
00:45:42,725 --> 00:45:45,935
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

879
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:48,438
True!

880
00:46:00,826 --> 00:46:04,579
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

881
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:07,082
Stay out of here!

882
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:12,337
Red' don't do it!

883
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:16,091
- Red!
- You assholes.

884
00:46:16,258 --> 00:46:17,842
You ruined my portable phone.

885
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,220
- TeamWork.
- Yes.

886
00:46:21,514 --> 00:46:23,598
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

887
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:28,937
Fuck.

888
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:30,480
Phone.

889
00:46:32,817 --> 00:46:35,026
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

890
00:46:35,194 --> 00:46:37,737
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

891
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,406
Tell us everything, now!

892
00:46:39,573 --> 00:46:40,907
Said they were gonna kill me.

893
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:43,076
What did you tell Ted?

894
00:46:43,244 --> 00:46:45,161
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

895
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:46,788
Smash them.

896
00:46:46,956 --> 00:46:47,997
Fuck!

897
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:50,959
Time out. Time out.

898
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:52,877
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

899
00:46:53,045 --> 00:46:54,838
- Stop!
- Cheater!

900
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:56,798
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

901
00:46:56,966 --> 00:46:59,384
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

902
00:47:00,636 --> 00:47:01,636
Fuck.

903
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:04,639
God...

904
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:06,099
Fuck!

905
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,268
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

906
00:47:10,604 --> 00:47:12,188
Fuck!

907
00:47:15,651 --> 00:47:17,026
No! No, no, no!

908
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:19,070
Where you going, huh?

909
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:21,322
Where do you think you're going'
Mr. Wiggles?

910
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:24,242
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

911
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:25,827
He's punching my bum!

912
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:28,747
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

913
00:47:28,914 --> 00:47:32,584
Use words! No! No! No!

914
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:37,172
You okay, man?

915
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:39,841
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

916
00:47:41,177 --> 00:47:42,886
Happy birthday.

917
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:44,429
- All right?
- Thank you.

918
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:46,890
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

919
00:47:47,057 --> 00:47:49,142
This ends now!

920
00:47:53,189 --> 00:47:54,647
Oh' shit.

921
00:47:54,815 --> 00:47:56,608
Was that too much?

922
00:47:58,486 --> 00:48:00,445
Can't get the edge.

923
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:02,864
Wait. Got it. Got it.

924
00:48:03,032 --> 00:48:04,199
Hey, Dale.

925
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:07,702
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

926
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,078
I don't think I am either.

927
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:12,040
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

928
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,626
Or, just not say anything.

929
00:48:15,753 --> 00:48:19,005
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

930
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,424
Wake up.

931
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,092
Hey, what's up' dudes?

932
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,346
What's up? Tell us everything noW.

933
00:48:26,514 --> 00:48:27,555
Talk, Red.

934
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:30,058
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

935
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:35,480
Trapped.

936
00:48:35,648 --> 00:48:36,898
Not happening, Red.

937
00:48:37,066 --> 00:48:39,567
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

938
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:44,239
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

939
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:47,408
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

940
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,911
Two real big son of a bitches.

941
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,830
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

942
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:54,624
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

943
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:56,626
So you guys are basically fucked.

944
00:48:56,794 --> 00:48:59,420
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

945
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:02,382
- Well' there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

946
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,802
I don't knoW. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

947
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,930
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

948
00:49:09,098 --> 00:49:10,682
- Oh' shit.
- What else?

949
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,059
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

950
00:49:13,227 --> 00:49:14,686
They're in a drug war right now.

951
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:17,188
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

952
00:49:17,356 --> 00:49:18,940
- It's true.
- What Asians?

953
00:49:19,108 --> 00:49:22,944
I don't knoW. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

954
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:24,112
Vietcong?

955
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,948
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

956
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:32,745
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

957
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:33,955
- Ding-dong.
- Hey' Red!

958
00:49:34,123 --> 00:49:35,456
- Oh' shit.
- Oh' they're here.

959
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:36,958
They're here to kill me.

960
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:41,004
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

961
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:43,590
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a neW friend.

962
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:45,967
I can make it up.
I forgot' "bro's before ho's."

963
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:48,595
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

964
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:50,138
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

965
00:49:50,306 --> 00:49:52,056
No sweat.

966
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,438
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

967
00:49:58,606 --> 00:50:01,774
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

968
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:06,029
Hey. In here.

969
00:50:06,196 --> 00:50:08,197
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

970
00:50:08,365 --> 00:50:09,991
- We should hide.
- Why?

971
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,076
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

972
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:13,995
...then they'll go to my apartment.

973
00:50:14,163 --> 00:50:17,874
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

974
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,542
No. I think we should stay.

975
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,045
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

976
00:50:22,212 --> 00:50:25,298
Well' then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

977
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:29,761
- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.

978
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,429
Red' it's your last chance, man.

979
00:50:31,597 --> 00:50:33,389
You gonna give us something
we can use?

980
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:36,976
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, What more do you want?

981
00:50:37,144 --> 00:50:39,228
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

982
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:41,022
He's obviously working with Saul.

983
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,191
They came in here'
busted my house to shit.

984
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,026
They kicked the hell out of me...

985
00:50:45,194 --> 00:50:47,362
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

986
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:50,031
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

987
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:53,868
- You hear that' Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

988
00:50:54,036 --> 00:50:56,537
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

989
00:50:56,705 --> 00:50:58,790
Denton might've been a JeW.
I don't knoW.

990
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:01,125
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

991
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:03,670
Obviously. We're friends.

992
00:51:03,837 --> 00:51:05,129
Ted, you hear him?

993
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:09,217
Dale Denton: Not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

994
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:12,887
Listen' I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

995
00:51:13,055 --> 00:51:15,556
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

996
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,392
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

997
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:19,560
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

998
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,022
What the hell are you doing?

999
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,899
Ted told me to kill him.

1000
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:27,902
Well' how about
a little fucking discretion here?

1001
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:29,946
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

1002
00:51:30,114 --> 00:51:31,239
- You catch it?
- See What?

1003
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:34,492
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

1004
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:37,704
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

1005
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:39,956
You was ruthless.

1006
00:51:40,124 --> 00:51:42,500
You was ruthless, man.

1007
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:45,753
What the fuck' man?
You shot me in my stomach.

1008
00:51:46,422 --> 00:51:48,131
I'm gonna die now probably.

1009
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:51,718
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

1010
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:53,428
This how you do me?

1011
00:51:56,974 --> 00:51:58,808
So, What did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

1012
00:51:58,976 --> 00:52:00,601
I don't knoW.

1013
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:04,022
There's this guy, Saul...

1014
00:52:04,606 --> 00:52:07,525
...something' selling weed who Works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

1015
00:52:07,693 --> 00:52:09,068
That's all he got out of him.

1016
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:12,655
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that We shot?

1017
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:14,699
Well' did he say anything else?

1018
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:18,119
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

1019
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:20,455
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

1020
00:52:20,622 --> 00:52:22,707
The Asians own the casino' Ted.

1021
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:26,294
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

1022
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:30,214
Maybe affer we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

1023
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:32,550
What's his name? Denton?
- To finish the job.

1024
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,052
Maybe.

1025
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:37,346
Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.

1026
00:52:37,514 --> 00:52:41,017
I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.

1027
00:52:41,185 --> 00:52:44,604
Who he's screwing'
who's his mother, everything.

1028
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:46,397
I have to take a shit.

1029
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,401
Wait. Where are We going?

1030
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:54,864
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

1031
00:52:55,032 --> 00:52:57,492
What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.

1032
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:00,244
I mean, she has
a difterent last name.

1033
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:01,746
Belogus.

1034
00:53:01,914 --> 00:53:05,249
I don't knoW. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

1035
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:23,226
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

1036
00:53:23,393 --> 00:53:27,146
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

1037
00:53:27,314 --> 00:53:30,191
And you can call it rude.
You can call it Whatever you want.

1038
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,778
You can be polite with your clean
plates' but I'm gonna be eating food.

1039
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:34,987
Dad' he'll be here.

1040
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:38,199
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

1041
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:41,369
Honey' we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

1042
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:46,916
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

1043
00:53:47,084 --> 00:53:48,709
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:50,920

1045
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:53,965

00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:56,717
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard' okay?

1047
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,636
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

1048
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:00,930
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

1049
00:54:01,098 --> 00:54:02,807
I'll keep guard.

1050
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:04,892

00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:20,199
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1057
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,659
Sit. Please.

1058
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:24,120
Of course. Hi.

1059
00:54:24,288 --> 00:54:25,913

1060
00:54:26,081 --> 00:54:27,707

1061
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:30,585
- Robert' if I'm not mistaken.

1062
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:33,212
- Hi, Dale.
- Hi. Okay.

1063
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,881
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1064
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:36,924
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1065
00:54:37,092 --> 00:54:38,217
So I'm here.

1066
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:41,554
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1067
00:54:41,722 --> 00:54:45,558
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude' you smell like shit.

1068
00:54:45,726 --> 00:54:48,394
- Dale' what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

1069
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:51,731
- In the Woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1070
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:53,774
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

1071
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:56,277
I bird-watch. I don't.

1072
00:54:56,445 --> 00:54:59,363
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1073
00:55:00,532 --> 00:55:03,201
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1074
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:05,286
I saW someone
murder someone else...

1075
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:07,955
...and I think
they've been following me.

1076
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:10,416
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1077
00:55:10,584 --> 00:55:12,293
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1078
00:55:12,461 --> 00:55:15,421
Her yearbooks, report cards'
her cell number is written...

1079
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:16,881
...and it's on my fridge.

1080
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:19,675
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1081
00:55:19,843 --> 00:55:21,552
We should call the police
right away.

1082
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,804
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1083
00:55:23,972 --> 00:55:26,515
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1084
00:55:26,683 --> 00:55:29,352
Angie' I swear to God'
you do something or I'm gonna...

1085
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:31,604
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

1086
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:35,316
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1087
00:55:35,484 --> 00:55:38,110
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1088
00:55:38,278 --> 00:55:40,780
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1089
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:42,782
You are high as a fucking kite.

1090
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,408
I'm not high. Let's go.

1091
00:55:44,576 --> 00:55:46,661
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1092
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:49,080
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1093
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:51,499
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1094
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:53,668
Your gun? His gun?

1095
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:56,295
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1096
00:55:56,463 --> 00:56:00,466
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1097
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:18,483
I just want you to knoW,
I always got your back.

1098
00:56:20,987 --> 00:56:23,363
And I'm glad we're partners.

1099
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:31,580
- This is so exciting.
- Okay, okay.

1100
00:56:31,748 --> 00:56:33,874
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1101
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,459
Who is after you, after Angie?

1102
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:39,046
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1103
00:56:39,213 --> 00:56:41,673
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1104
00:56:41,841 --> 00:56:44,259
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

1105
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:47,846
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1106
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:49,306
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

1107
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:51,224
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1108
00:56:51,392 --> 00:56:54,645
- Angie' What did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

1109
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:56,939
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

1110
00:56:57,106 --> 00:56:58,231
- I got it.
- Get it.

1111
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:03,153
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale' who is this?

1112
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,323
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

1113
00:57:11,037 --> 00:57:12,287
What was that?

1114
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:14,539
That was a gunshot.

1115
00:57:18,544 --> 00:57:20,420
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1116
00:57:20,588 --> 00:57:22,547
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

1117
00:57:22,715 --> 00:57:25,092
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

1118
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:27,010
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1119
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:29,972
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1120
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:31,890
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

1121
00:57:38,106 --> 00:57:40,607
- Where's your gun?
- I don't need it.

1122
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:43,485
Kill motherfuckers With my hands.

1123
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:48,031
Get out your goddamn gun.
You're making me uncomfortable.

1124
00:57:58,668 --> 00:58:00,627
Anybody out there?

1125
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:06,091
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1126
00:58:06,259 --> 00:58:07,884
Say, now.

1127
00:58:10,388 --> 00:58:12,764
Hey, the food's still warm.

1128
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,019
Love it.

1129
00:58:17,186 --> 00:58:19,438
I found a bloody fork.

1130
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:23,233
It's fucking freaky, man.
They could still be here.

1131
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:25,652
Did you check the rest of the house?

1132
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:29,031
I'm about to check that bathroom,
I know that much.

1133
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:31,491
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1134
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:34,161
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe' guys. We made it.

1135
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:35,662
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

1136
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:38,540
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1137
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,834
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1138
00:58:41,002 --> 00:58:43,128
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

Used to call it Spanish Mudflaps...

1155
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:36,765
...but Troy likes to trampoline
so Spanish Trampoline.

1156
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:39,142
- Almost the same number of syllables.
- How much?

1157
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,394
- Forty-five for these last three.
- All right.

1158
00:59:41,562 --> 00:59:44,272
- And leave me the best stash.
- All right.

1159
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,483
It's Pineapple Express.
Get your ass up.

1160
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:49,194
Yup' of course.

1161
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:54,241
So get this:

1162
00:59:54,408 --> 00:59:55,992
We triangulated the cells.

1163
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,746
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1164
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:01,915
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1165
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,793
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1166
01:00:04,961 --> 01:00:07,337
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1167
01:00:07,505 --> 01:00:10,757
A powdered wig,
a sombrero' leotards.

1168
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:12,801
I mean, What the fuck
does that mean?

1169
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:15,470
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1170
01:00:15,638 --> 01:00:17,931
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1171
01:00:29,527 --> 01:00:30,569
Hello?

1172
01:00:30,736 --> 01:00:31,778
Cheung, it's Ted.

1173
01:00:31,946 --> 01:00:33,238
Record this conversation.

1174
01:00:33,865 --> 01:00:37,617
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1175
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:41,788
Well' Cheung' my friend,
let me tell you.

1176
01:00:41,956 --> 01:00:45,876
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1177
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:50,046
...hit men over here last night,
and I and my colleague...

1178
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:53,383
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1179
01:00:53,551 --> 01:00:56,928
We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.

1180
01:00:57,096 --> 01:01:00,765
And noW this Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1181
01:01:00,933 --> 01:01:04,519
Just stop it' okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1182
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:05,937
- What?
- What?

1183
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:07,522
- Hello?
- Troy?

1184
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:12,277
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you
I'm gonna call some hot bitches later...

1185
01:01:12,445 --> 01:01:14,946
...and this is the time.
- I got you your own line...

1186
01:01:15,114 --> 01:01:17,365
...so you would stay off mine.
Get off the phone.

1187
01:01:17,533 --> 01:01:20,994
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!

1188
01:01:21,162 --> 01:01:24,581
And from this point forward, I'm
not taking any of your fucking shit.

1189
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:29,044
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic
in our relationship is about to change.

1190
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:31,463
Troy, do me a favor'
get oft the fucking phone!

1191
01:01:32,048 --> 01:01:35,175
- Shit.
- So you have a son.

1192
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:37,344
Sounds like a very nice boy.

1193
01:01:37,511 --> 01:01:40,305
All right, you listen to me, Cheung,
you motherfucker!

1194
01:01:40,473 --> 01:01:42,933
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1195
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,644
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1196
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:47,479
...and be ready for everything!

1197
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,522
You are fucking dead!

1198
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,775
You are so dumb.

1199
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:55,445
Do you have any idea
how Weak you just made us look?

1200
01:01:56,906 --> 01:01:59,991
Goddamn it!

1201
01:02:00,326 --> 01:02:01,660
Totally sweet.

1202
01:02:02,078 --> 01:02:04,371
Ted Jones is slipping.

1203
01:02:04,538 --> 01:02:08,166
We shall strike now with full force.

1204
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:12,087
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1205
01:02:14,632 --> 01:02:18,260
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1206
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:21,012
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1207
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,682
- Really? Thanks' man.
- No problem.

1208
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:26,309
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1209
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:30,272
It's' like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1210
01:02:30,439 --> 01:02:34,359
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1211
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:37,529
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1212
01:02:38,739 --> 01:02:40,240
Yeah.

1213
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:45,537
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1214
01:02:45,705 --> 01:02:47,372
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1215
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:49,541
Get bus tickets.

1216
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:53,169
Go to the next toWn.
Contact some police.

1217
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,588
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

1218
01:02:55,756 --> 01:02:57,716
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1219
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:00,051
But We should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1220
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:01,428
What?

1221
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:04,723
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1222
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:08,226
I only have' like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1223
01:03:08,811 --> 01:03:10,103
What about your sack?

1224
01:03:10,271 --> 01:03:13,148
Oh' man' it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1225
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:17,277
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1226
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:18,903
I mean, like' the sack of weed.

1227
01:03:19,071 --> 01:03:21,156
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1228
01:03:21,324 --> 01:03:22,991
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1229
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:27,203
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

1230
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:30,165
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1231
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,916
These guys are amazing.

1232
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:33,793
What the fuck do you want?

1233
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:36,129
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1234
01:03:42,928 --> 01:03:44,429
What's this stuff called again?

1235
01:03:44,597 --> 01:03:46,598
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1236
01:03:46,766 --> 01:03:49,976
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1237
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:53,021
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at Weed too.

1238
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:56,107
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1239
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:58,777
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

1240
01:03:58,944 --> 01:04:02,989
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1241
01:04:03,157 --> 01:04:04,574
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1242
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:24,552
- How much money you guys gotu
- Come on.

1243
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,097
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1244
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,557
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1245
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:33,395
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1246
01:04:33,562 --> 01:04:37,732
You got it from Saul... I mean' you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1247
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,735
- Go. Come on.
- Go' go. Vamoose!

1248
01:04:42,822 --> 01:04:43,905
You fucking did it, man.

1249
01:04:44,073 --> 01:04:46,741
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1250
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:49,327
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1251
01:04:49,495 --> 01:04:50,995
Get some burritos or something.

1252
01:04:51,163 --> 01:04:53,164
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1253
01:04:53,332 --> 01:04:55,750
See you' man. Nice.

1254
01:05:01,966 --> 01:05:05,343
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1255
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:07,137
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1256
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:09,055
It's Weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1257
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:10,932
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

1258
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,643
I thought it was decriminalized'
to be honest with you.

1259
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:18,064
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1260
01:05:18,232 --> 01:05:23,027
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1261
01:05:23,195 --> 01:05:26,197
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1262
01:05:26,365 --> 01:05:29,451
And guess what? I just saw three
students Walking from back here...

1263
01:05:29,618 --> 01:05:32,954
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1264
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,045
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

1265
01:05:41,213 --> 01:05:42,922
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1266
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:45,884
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

1267
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:49,762
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1268
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,765
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1269
01:05:56,437 --> 01:05:58,897
Oh' big sexy with glasses.

1270
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:04,694
This is Ofticer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1271
01:06:04,862 --> 01:06:09,407
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1272
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:11,576

What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

1275
01:06:16,832 --> 01:06:19,083
What did that thing tell you?

1276
01:06:19,251 --> 01:06:21,503
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1277
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,172
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1278
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,758
Hit-and-run' Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1279
01:06:26,926 --> 01:06:28,426
Two parked cars, tWo nights ago.

01:06:28,594 --> 01:06:30,637
One of them Was actually
a police cruiser.

1281
01:06:30,804 --> 01:06:33,681
You gotta be the dumbest

01:06:44,735 --> 01:06:47,570

1288
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:52,617

01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,668
I'll take this badge off,

01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:20,538
Well' kick out the window!

1314
01:08:20,706 --> 01:08:23,458
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

1315
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:27,337
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1316
01:08:30,716 --> 01:08:32,050
Get your foot out of there.

1317
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,886
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1318
01:08:35,054 --> 01:08:36,095
Her car's better.

1319
01:08:36,263 --> 01:08:38,681
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

1320
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:41,726
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1321
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,314
Oh' no' no' no!

1322
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:49,651
Oh' shit!

1323
01:08:49,818 --> 01:08:51,527
Get it out!

1324
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:55,573
I can't see!

1325
01:09:00,913 --> 01:09:05,333
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree' tree! Squirrel!

1326
01:09:08,253 --> 01:09:09,837
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1327
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:11,756
Nice! Look out! Tree' tree, tree!

1328
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:16,386
You did it, man.

1329
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,180
All right! Look out!

1330
01:09:19,348 --> 01:09:21,432
Oh' shit!

1331
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,018
Turn around! Turn around!

1332
01:09:32,277 --> 01:09:34,112
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1333
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:36,614
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

1334
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:39,033
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1335
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:45,873
Oh' shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1336
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:48,292
Sorry!

1337
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:51,170
What the fuck was that?

1338
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:53,589
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1339
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:55,633
- Why?
- I don't know.

1340
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:14,152
Oh' my.

1341
01:10:18,616 --> 01:10:21,034
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1342
01:10:21,202 --> 01:10:23,870
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

1343
01:10:24,038 --> 01:10:26,831
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1344
01:10:26,999 --> 01:10:29,876
Come back! Saul!

1345
01:10:30,044 --> 01:10:31,378
- Sorry' man.
- Thank you.

1346
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:35,507
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1347
01:10:39,178 --> 01:10:40,637
I haven't used a gun since Uam.

1348
01:10:40,805 --> 01:10:44,724
Angie' you have exhibited
poor decision-making skills.

1349
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:45,892
Oh' this is my fault.

1350
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,812
And we have hosted violence
in our home because of it.

1351
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,939
- "Hosted violence"?
- He's a bad guy.

1352
01:10:51,107 --> 01:10:53,733
You don't see that
you have stooped way' way below...

1353
01:10:53,901 --> 01:10:56,820
- You loWered your expectations...
...of what you are worthy of.

1354
01:10:56,988 --> 01:10:59,906
...but this guy is so far beneath you.
You deserve much better.

1355
01:11:00,074 --> 01:11:02,075
Open your heart
to someone who deserves you.

1356
01:11:02,243 --> 01:11:04,286
Or don't have a boyfriend
at all for a while.

1357
01:11:04,453 --> 01:11:06,246
- We're stuck in this room.
- I love him.

1358
01:11:06,414 --> 01:11:08,039
- It's not your decision.
- Love him?

1359
01:11:08,207 --> 01:11:10,875
- You don't know What love is.
- I'm gonna date him.

1360
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:13,253
- We're going to the police.
- That's what I said.

1361
01:11:13,421 --> 01:11:15,588
- I know.
- He said not to go to the police.

1362
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:18,174
- You should listen. He's a lawyer.
- You come with us.

1363
01:11:18,342 --> 01:11:20,927
- He can't possibly work in law.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1364
01:11:21,095 --> 01:11:22,262
- You stay.
- We're leaving.

1365
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,514
- You stay in the room.
- Fine, go. Fine, go.

1366
01:11:24,682 --> 01:11:27,434
And we don't need the shampoos.
Why did...?

1367
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:32,856
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1368
01:11:33,024 --> 01:11:34,774
...l'm moving on.

1369
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,613
Okay.

1370
01:11:40,781 --> 01:11:42,365
All right.

1371
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:46,619
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1372
01:11:46,787 --> 01:11:48,079
As sure as shit you will.

1373
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:50,040
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1374
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:53,710
We're gonna go to the farm tonight'
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1375
01:11:53,878 --> 01:11:56,463
Then tomorrow morning'
we're gonna hunt these guys doWn.

1376
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:59,132
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1377
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,468
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1378
01:12:01,969 --> 01:12:03,678
So smile.

1379
01:12:03,846 --> 01:12:05,430
Shut up.

1380
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:12,187
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1381
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,355
All right. Are you using protection?

1382
01:12:15,523 --> 01:12:16,606
- Days Inn.
- Yes.

1383
01:12:16,774 --> 01:12:18,650
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1384
01:12:19,485 --> 01:12:21,403
- Hello?
- Hello, is Angie there?

1385
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:23,405
- Dale.
- Angie?

1386
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:26,283
- My God' are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.

1387
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:27,784
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1388
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,536
Okay, good. I came up with a plan.

1389
01:12:29,704 --> 01:12:31,872
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1390
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:34,916
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

1391
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:40,005
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1392
01:12:40,172 --> 01:12:43,049
I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...

1393
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:46,094
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1394
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:47,804
I can't be addicted to marijuana.

1395
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:51,141
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1396
01:12:51,309 --> 01:12:54,185
B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.

1397
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:55,645
And noW I'm dealing With it.

1398
01:12:55,813 --> 01:12:58,315
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1399
01:12:58,482 --> 01:13:00,984
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1400
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:02,652
- We have to work through it.
- No.

1401
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,279
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1402
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,907
I should not be in this situation'
so fuck you.

1403
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:08,408
You know what? It's over.

1404
01:13:08,576 --> 01:13:11,077
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1405
01:13:11,245 --> 01:13:14,581
Congratulations. Sad to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1406
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:16,082
What the fuck does that mean?

1407
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,919
It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.

1408
01:13:19,086 --> 01:13:21,171
You'll get into
Godspeed Nou! Black Emperor...

1409
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:22,505
...and the fucking Shins.

1410
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:25,258
And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...

1411
01:13:25,426 --> 01:13:28,136
...and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.

1412
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:30,722
You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.

1413
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,974
A lesbian? Fuck you' Dale!

1414
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,893
You never did like me anyway,
did you?

1415
01:13:35,061 --> 01:13:36,603
You didn't wanna meet my parents.

1416
01:13:36,771 --> 01:13:39,356
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1417
01:13:39,523 --> 01:13:40,774
I always care about you.

1418
01:13:40,942 --> 01:13:42,776
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1419
01:13:42,944 --> 01:13:45,362
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1420
01:13:45,529 --> 01:13:49,658
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1421
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,868
Call me when I can go home.

1422
01:13:52,787 --> 01:13:57,290
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1423
01:13:57,458 --> 01:14:00,669
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1424
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:03,546
I know' I'm sorry about the clocks.

1425
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:07,842
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1426
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,552
I love you.

1427
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,888
You wise-ass.

1428
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:15,475
Hey, you all right' man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1429
01:14:15,643 --> 01:14:18,061
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1430
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:19,312
First things first.

1431
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:24,693
- Don't do that' okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

1432
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,028
Why not? Car chase' gunshots.

1433
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,655
That clearly just happened...

1434
01:14:28,823 --> 01:14:31,157
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1435
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:33,326
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1436
01:14:33,494 --> 01:14:35,662
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1437
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:38,665
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

1438
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:41,334
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1439
01:14:41,502 --> 01:14:44,838
- We are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1440
01:14:45,006 --> 01:14:47,757
Well' I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right noW.

1441
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:50,760
I was, like' stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1442
01:14:50,928 --> 01:14:52,345
What do you gotta say to that?

1443
01:14:52,513 --> 01:14:55,098
Well' that would be true
if you had saved me.

1444
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:56,391
But you didn't save me.

1445
01:14:56,559 --> 01:14:58,476
She was gonna help'
you made things Worse.

1446
01:14:58,644 --> 01:15:00,520
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1447
01:15:00,688 --> 01:15:02,689
Don't fucking get on my case'
all right?

1448
01:15:02,857 --> 01:15:04,524
Only reason I started selling pot...

1449
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:07,277
...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.

1450
01:15:07,445 --> 01:15:09,612
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

1451
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,114
I'm gonna become something.

1452
01:15:11,282 --> 01:15:13,825
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1453
01:15:13,993 --> 01:15:16,327
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1454
01:15:16,495 --> 01:15:17,996
Little kids can take shits.

1455
01:15:18,164 --> 01:15:19,789
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1456
01:15:19,957 --> 01:15:22,042
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1457
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:24,794
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1458
01:15:24,962 --> 01:15:28,173
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1459
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:30,759
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

1460
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,428
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1461
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:35,430
Boring people to death on the radio.

1462
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:39,225
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1463
01:15:39,393 --> 01:15:41,227
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

1464
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:44,397
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1465
01:15:44,565 --> 01:15:46,191
I'm, like' a totally nice guy.

1466
01:15:46,358 --> 01:15:48,860
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1467
01:15:49,028 --> 01:15:50,820
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1468
01:15:50,988 --> 01:15:53,323
You were cold and I clothed you.

1469
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:57,077
Now about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1470
01:15:57,244 --> 01:15:58,912
You didn't say anything back.

1471
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,623
Well' that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1472
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,249
You are my drug dealer.

1473
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,168
There's one reason
we know each other.

1474
01:16:05,336 --> 01:16:07,378
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1475
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:10,757
If you didn't sell those drugs'
I would have no idea who you Were...

1476
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:14,094
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1477
01:16:16,055 --> 01:16:19,057
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1478
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:20,767
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

1479
01:16:20,935 --> 01:16:23,394
Monkey's out of the bottle' man.

1480
01:16:23,562 --> 01:16:25,605
What? That's not even
an expression.

1481
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:28,483
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1482
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:30,527
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1483
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:34,489
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

1484
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:37,242
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1485
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:39,494
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1486
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,080
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1487
01:16:42,248 --> 01:16:44,457
I didn't mean that.

1488
01:16:56,887 --> 01:16:59,639
I love you. Do you love me?

1489
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:44,267
That looks great.

1490
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,359
Hello?

1491
01:17:54,445 --> 01:17:55,737
Dale?

1492
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,280
It is Dale.

1493
01:17:57,448 --> 01:18:02,327
Angie' I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the World...

1494
01:18:02,494 --> 01:18:05,914
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1495
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,832
I'll do anything.

1496
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,586
I've had a near-death experience'
and when that happens...

1497
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:14,464
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it' okay?

1498
01:18:14,632 --> 01:18:16,799
So please
just take me back, please.

1499
01:18:16,967 --> 01:18:19,052
- I love you.
- I love you.

1500
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,389
- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.

1501
01:18:23,557 --> 01:18:27,018
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

1502
01:18:27,186 --> 01:18:28,394
I don't knoW. I just...

1503
01:18:28,562 --> 01:18:29,979
I wanna marry you.

1504
01:18:33,067 --> 01:18:34,734
I made a mistake.

1505
01:18:34,902 --> 01:18:37,237
- What do you mean?
- I've...

1506
01:18:37,655 --> 01:18:40,073
- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.

1507
01:18:40,241 --> 01:18:42,825
- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?

1508
01:18:42,993 --> 01:18:44,577
I don't knoW.

1509
01:18:44,745 --> 01:18:46,871
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1510
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,957
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1511
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:52,710
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1512
01:18:52,878 --> 01:18:56,005
- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. You're immature.

1513
01:18:56,173 --> 01:18:59,384
I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.

1514
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:00,843
Just because you're older.

1515
01:19:01,011 --> 01:19:03,554
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1516
01:19:03,722 --> 01:19:05,890
- Really?
- How many girls have you slept with?

1517
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:08,142
- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?

1518
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,519
What is a half? Your hand?

1519
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:12,605
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.

1520
01:19:12,773 --> 01:19:15,441
I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."

1521
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:17,986
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.

1522
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:19,487
Screw you.

1523
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:20,822
Get me out of this room.

1524
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:24,075
I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?

1525
01:19:26,245 --> 01:19:30,039
Oh' thank goodness. Okay.

1526
01:19:33,252 --> 01:19:35,545
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1527
01:19:36,964 --> 01:19:38,298
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1528
01:19:38,465 --> 01:19:40,300
Do you use the pool over here?

1529
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:43,219
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1530
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:46,597
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

1531
01:19:46,765 --> 01:19:48,683
What are you talking about'
my grandson?

1532
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:51,602
You told me you wanna sit down'
play dominos with me.

1533
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,771
And noW you're hocking me
about my grandson.

1534
01:19:53,939 --> 01:19:56,607
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1535
01:19:56,775 --> 01:19:57,900
May I call you Faye?

1536
01:19:58,068 --> 01:20:01,195
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1537
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,905
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1538
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:04,615
What do you want from me?

1539
01:20:04,783 --> 01:20:06,159
Bubbe. Hey, guys.

1540
01:20:06,327 --> 01:20:08,828
- Well' look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

1541
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:13,958
Damn.

1542
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,210
Oh' shit.

1543
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,004
Sorry' Betty.

1544
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,761
They kidnapped my grandson.

1545
01:20:24,928 --> 01:20:26,846
Yeah, these tWo guys came in...

1546
01:20:27,014 --> 01:20:30,016
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1547
01:20:30,184 --> 01:20:32,268
I never saw them in my life before.

1548
01:20:32,436 --> 01:20:35,605
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1549
01:20:35,773 --> 01:20:40,234
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1550
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:44,197
And the other guy'
he was very good-looking...

1551
01:20:44,365 --> 01:20:45,698
...but he was short as shit.

1552
01:20:45,866 --> 01:20:47,784
But the Worst part was...

1553
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:52,330
...that my grandson came in'
why, and in pajamas.

1554
01:20:52,498 --> 01:20:54,499
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

1555
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:55,917
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1556
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,960
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1557
01:20:58,128 --> 01:20:59,670
I believe that's a mole' ma'am.

1558
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:08,554
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1559
01:21:08,722 --> 01:21:10,473
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1560
01:21:10,641 --> 01:21:13,476
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1561
01:21:13,644 --> 01:21:15,853
Where am I, man? What?

1562
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:19,482
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1563
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,983
Shit. Did I do that?

1564
01:21:22,653 --> 01:21:25,655
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1565
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,157
Fuck you, man!

1566
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:31,035
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

1567
01:21:31,203 --> 01:21:32,537
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1568
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:34,705
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1569
01:21:34,873 --> 01:21:38,251
- Lf anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like hamburglar.

1570
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:39,460
And the Elephant Man.

1571
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,838
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1572
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:43,756
Professional. Professional.

1573
01:21:43,924 --> 01:21:46,050
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever' man.

1574
01:21:46,218 --> 01:21:48,344
- Where were you?
- I was there.

1575
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:50,388
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

1576
01:21:50,556 --> 01:21:52,223
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1577
01:21:52,391 --> 01:21:54,600
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1578
01:21:54,768 --> 01:21:57,145
Fuck all this' you know?
Get him out of here.

1579
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:00,565
Take him doWnstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1580
01:22:00,732 --> 01:22:02,900
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1581
01:22:03,068 --> 01:22:06,028
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1582
01:22:06,196 --> 01:22:07,822
I might act tough...

1583
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,074
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1584
01:22:10,451 --> 01:22:13,369
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1585
01:22:14,413 --> 01:22:16,122
This ain't over.

1586
01:22:16,582 --> 01:22:18,458
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

1587
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,668
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1588
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:24,130
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1589
01:22:24,298 --> 01:22:26,549
...because when Ted gets here'
he's gonna be like:

1590
01:22:26,717 --> 01:22:29,802
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1591
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,970
Watch your head.

1592
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:34,724
Hey, watch him.

1593
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,810
Oh' my God.

1594
01:22:37,978 --> 01:22:40,313
El Dorado.

1595
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:42,857
The legends are true.

1596
01:22:43,484 --> 01:22:45,651
Look at all this weed, man.

1597
01:22:45,819 --> 01:22:47,570
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1598
01:22:47,738 --> 01:22:50,114
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

1599
01:22:50,282 --> 01:22:52,074
OG Kush?

1600
01:22:52,242 --> 01:22:53,576
OG Kush.

1601
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:03,377
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1602
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,213
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

1603
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:07,298
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

1604
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:24,482
Hello?

1605
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:26,025
Red?

1606
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:34,116
- Red?
- What the fuck?

1607
01:23:34,284 --> 01:23:37,078
Get out of here' man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1608
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:40,373
Look, I come in peace' okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1609
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:41,958
Good.

1610
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:44,877
Because I'm tired' man.
Not feeling so hot.

1611
01:23:45,045 --> 01:23:46,879
You don't look great.

1612
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:48,589
They shot me, Denton.

1613
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,049
They got me right here.

1614
01:23:50,217 --> 01:23:51,551
- Yeah?
- Right here.

1615
01:23:51,718 --> 01:23:53,553
And then they got me again
right here.

1616
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,931
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1617
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,641
They'll save your life' okay?

1618
01:23:58,809 --> 01:24:00,726
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

1619
01:24:00,894 --> 01:24:03,521
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1620
01:24:03,689 --> 01:24:05,940
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1621
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:08,234
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1622
01:24:08,402 --> 01:24:11,320
And when he does'
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1623
01:24:11,488 --> 01:24:13,114
He's just, like' an asshole.

1624
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:16,242
I couldn't agree more' Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1625
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,244
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1626
01:24:18,412 --> 01:24:19,787
And I'm gonna get him back.

1627
01:24:19,955 --> 01:24:21,956
You know, like, he saved my life.

1628
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:25,251
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1629
01:24:25,419 --> 01:24:28,254
He is. I'll tell you that' man.
Saul is a good dude.

1630
01:24:28,422 --> 01:24:29,505
I was mean to him' man.

1631
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:32,425
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

1632
01:24:32,593 --> 01:24:36,262
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1633
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:40,308
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1634
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:42,435
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1635
01:24:42,603 --> 01:24:46,564
And it's a shell' and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1636
01:24:46,732 --> 01:24:50,860
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1637
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:53,404
Except' if you're a dick
your whole life...

1638
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:56,449
...your next shell
will be made of shit' okay?

1639
01:24:56,617 --> 01:24:59,368
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1640
01:24:59,536 --> 01:25:03,289
Or a Worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1641
01:25:03,457 --> 01:25:05,833
If you're a man'
and you act heroic...

1642
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:07,585
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1643
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:09,295
You'll come back as a dragon.

1644
01:25:09,463 --> 01:25:11,130
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1645
01:25:11,965 --> 01:25:14,133
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1646
01:25:14,301 --> 01:25:17,637
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

1647
01:25:17,804 --> 01:25:18,846
It belongs to me.

1648
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:20,473
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

1649
01:25:20,641 --> 01:25:24,477
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it' you know? Use the pain.

1650
01:25:24,645 --> 01:25:25,853
You'll have a second wind.

1651
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:28,439
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1652
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:31,275
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1653
01:25:31,443 --> 01:25:34,612
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1654
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,073
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1655
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,908
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1656
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:41,369
I think' "Yes, I'm gonna
help you' Dale"...

1657
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:43,329
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1658
01:25:44,956 --> 01:25:46,332
Come here.

1659
01:25:49,503 --> 01:25:53,214
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1660
01:25:55,676 --> 01:25:57,760
Thug life.

1661
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:04,975
Oh' shit.

1662
01:26:05,143 --> 01:26:07,853
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1663
01:26:08,021 --> 01:26:10,106
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1664
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:19,782
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1665
01:26:24,788 --> 01:26:27,873
Don't.

1666
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:29,709
Just something quick like that.

1667
01:26:29,876 --> 01:26:31,377
- Don't.
- Yeah.

1668
01:26:31,545 --> 01:26:33,713
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

1669
01:26:46,977 --> 01:26:48,811
Oh' God.

1670
01:26:51,481 --> 01:26:53,566
That's a big hideout.

1671
01:26:55,485 --> 01:26:57,528
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1672
01:26:57,696 --> 01:27:00,656
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1673
01:27:00,824 --> 01:27:03,743
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1674
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:06,328
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1675
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,581
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1676
01:27:08,749 --> 01:27:11,667
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1677
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:14,003
Oh' man' no.
This is lame of you, man.

1678
01:27:14,171 --> 01:27:16,547
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1679
01:27:16,715 --> 01:27:17,923
This could be your moment.

1680
01:27:18,091 --> 01:27:20,634
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine' go.

1681
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:21,844
Fuck you.

1682
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:24,180
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1683
01:27:24,347 --> 01:27:28,559
Legends never die' dude.
I'll tell your story.

1684
01:27:29,269 --> 01:27:32,104
Carol' she's cool now.

1685
01:27:32,272 --> 01:27:36,233
Carol used to be a little crazy' man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1686
01:27:36,401 --> 01:27:38,694
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

1687
01:27:38,862 --> 01:27:41,280
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1688
01:27:41,448 --> 01:27:43,741
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1689
01:27:43,909 --> 01:27:46,118
All right, everybody be cool' man.
Be cool.

1690
01:27:46,286 --> 01:27:47,828
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1691
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:49,622
Put them down. On the ground.

1692
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:52,124
All right, everybody just chill.

1693
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:54,210
Oh' my God!

1694
01:27:54,377 --> 01:27:56,045
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

1695
01:27:56,213 --> 01:27:58,756
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

1696
01:27:58,924 --> 01:28:01,217
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1697
01:28:01,384 --> 01:28:03,177
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1698
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:06,096
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1699
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:08,766
Now' I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1700
01:28:08,934 --> 01:28:10,851
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1701
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:13,145
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1702
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:15,147
End of story.

1703
01:28:15,315 --> 01:28:17,316
I'm telling Ted.

1704
01:28:17,484 --> 01:28:19,276
- Lf you do...
- He's got a piece.

1705
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:21,028
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1706
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:22,863
He's got another one' in the side.

1707
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:24,657
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1708
01:28:24,825 --> 01:28:27,076
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1709
01:28:27,244 --> 01:28:29,411
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1710
01:28:29,579 --> 01:28:30,830
No. Come on.

1711
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:36,335
- Oh' great.

1712
01:28:36,503 --> 01:28:37,628
- Dale.
- Yes.

1713
01:28:37,796 --> 01:28:40,965
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did' you bastard?

1714
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:43,008
- No, man.
- Yes.

1715
01:28:43,176 --> 01:28:44,844
I'm here to save you.

1716
01:28:45,011 --> 01:28:47,680
No. You just got caught too.

1717
01:28:47,848 --> 01:28:50,224
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1718
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:52,476
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1719
01:28:52,644 --> 01:28:55,479
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole' man.

1720
01:28:55,647 --> 01:28:58,816
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1721
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:02,194
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1722
01:29:02,362 --> 01:29:04,780
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1723
01:29:04,948 --> 01:29:08,033
So that's What I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1724
01:29:08,201 --> 01:29:10,703
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1725
01:29:10,871 --> 01:29:12,621
You're a mean jerk.

1726
01:29:12,789 --> 01:29:15,749
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

1727
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,168
I didn't Want
you to be my best friend.

1728
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,046
I didn't Wanna think
that that's what my life was.

1729
01:29:21,214 --> 01:29:23,674
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

1730
01:29:23,842 --> 01:29:25,342

1740
01:29:52,537 --> 01:29:55,080
- Okay. Sorry about that' sir.

1741
01:29:55,248 --> 01:29:57,416

- Is it Working?
- I can't feel it.

1747
01:30:11,932 --> 01:30:12,932

- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

1765
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,148
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1766
01:31:03,316 --> 01:31:06,235
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1767
01:31:06,403 --> 01:31:07,820
It's gross.

1768
01:31:07,988 --> 01:31:10,280
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

1769
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:14,243
...armed to the teeth, and'
as you can see' he shot Peter.

1770
01:31:14,411 --> 01:31:16,620
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1771
01:31:16,788 --> 01:31:19,999
How they're both disarmed
and they're doWnstairs.

1772
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:21,750
He shot Pete?

1773
01:31:21,918 --> 01:31:23,919
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1774
01:31:24,087 --> 01:31:26,630
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1775
01:31:26,798 --> 01:31:30,092
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1776
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:36,682
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1777
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,892
Take his stash and burn

1778
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,187
Stop. Wait here.

1779
01:31:42,355 --> 01:31:45,107
No retreat, no surrender.

1780
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:51,613
Yes, yes, yes.

1781
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:54,616
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay' okay.

1782
01:31:54,784 --> 01:31:58,203
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice' you go, okay?

1783
01:31:58,371 --> 01:32:00,539
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

1784
01:32:00,707 --> 01:32:02,624
Just don't. Don't...

1785
01:32:08,214 --> 01:32:11,300
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1786
01:32:11,468 --> 01:32:15,554
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1787
01:32:15,722 --> 01:32:17,222
Stop.

1788
01:32:20,602 --> 01:32:23,187
See' I don't think
you understood me.

1789
01:32:23,354 --> 01:32:25,189
I can hear everything you're saying.

1790
01:32:25,356 --> 01:32:28,067
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1791
01:32:28,234 --> 01:32:30,736
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

1792
01:32:30,904 --> 01:32:33,155
Y'all fuck on your own time' man.

1793
01:32:33,323 --> 01:32:34,907
Sorry' man. It was a stupid plan.

1794
01:32:35,075 --> 01:32:37,493
What the fuck is that?

1795
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:40,829
Dale!

1796
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:48,378
I've been Waiting for this.
You burned my face!

1797
01:32:50,673 --> 01:32:53,008
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1798
01:32:59,516 --> 01:33:01,016
You shot me.

1799
01:33:01,184 --> 01:33:02,559
I'm sorry, man.

1800
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:06,438
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1801
01:33:06,606 --> 01:33:08,232
I got glass in my ass.

1802
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:10,984
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

1803
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:13,278
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1804
01:33:15,615 --> 01:33:17,658
Asians!

1805
01:33:22,622 --> 01:33:23,622
War is upon you!

1806
01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:25,624
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

1807
01:33:31,798 --> 01:33:32,881
Get doWn' motherfucker!

1808
01:33:37,428 --> 01:33:38,637
Come on!

1809
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:42,599
Fuck!

1810
01:33:51,985 --> 01:33:53,318
Go! Go!

1811
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:54,653
Get doWn' baby!

1812
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:56,572
Dale, no!

1813
01:33:56,739 --> 01:33:58,365
No, wake up, man.

1814
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:00,409
No, you're not dying, man.

1815
01:34:00,577 --> 01:34:03,162
Not without me.

1816
01:34:03,329 --> 01:34:04,663
- Dale.
- What?

1817
01:34:04,831 --> 01:34:06,665
You're alive.

1818
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:10,335
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

1819
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,005
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

1820
01:34:13,173 --> 01:34:15,883
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

1821
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:18,677
Fuck!

1822
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:22,431
- Help!
- My ear.

1823
01:34:22,599 --> 01:34:23,640
- Yeah.
- Help!

1824
01:34:23,808 --> 01:34:25,893
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

1825
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,978
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

1826
01:34:28,146 --> 01:34:29,188
You shot him?

1827
01:34:29,355 --> 01:34:31,565
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

1828
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:33,358
We've had enough out of you.

1829
01:34:33,526 --> 01:34:34,776
I'm not your friend.

1830
01:34:34,944 --> 01:34:36,320
Maybe I can just...

1831
01:34:36,487 --> 01:34:38,488
No. No, infected.

1832
01:34:38,656 --> 01:34:41,033
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1833
01:35:15,568 --> 01:35:17,236
It's clear.

1834
01:35:18,154 --> 01:35:20,489
Dude. Look.

1835
01:35:20,657 --> 01:35:22,241
Nice.

1836
01:35:34,587 --> 01:35:36,088
Bullets.

1837
01:35:44,264 --> 01:35:47,099
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1838
01:35:47,267 --> 01:35:50,602
Is it really disgusting
or is it' like, kind of cool in a way?

1839
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:52,813
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1840
01:35:52,981 --> 01:35:54,940
I feel like I can smell it.

1841
01:35:55,108 --> 01:35:57,609
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1842
01:35:57,777 --> 01:35:58,819
You can't even tell.

1843
01:35:58,987 --> 01:36:00,112
That's a good point.

1844
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:01,655
Wait.

1845
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:45,741
Did you shoot that guy?

1846
01:36:45,908 --> 01:36:47,492
No. I'm out of bullets.

1847
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:49,202
Me too.

1848
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,663
Maybe it was ricochet.

1849
01:36:51,831 --> 01:36:53,832
Gravity.

1850
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,709
Oh' nice.

1851
01:36:55,877 --> 01:36:57,836
You go down.

1852
01:36:58,004 --> 01:36:59,171
I'll cover.

1853
01:36:59,339 --> 01:37:02,507
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1854
01:37:07,013 --> 01:37:08,847
Sexy motherfucker.

1855
01:37:27,492 --> 01:37:29,868
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1856
01:37:30,036 --> 01:37:32,329
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1857
01:37:32,497 --> 01:37:35,707
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1858
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,252
Oh' nice.

1859
01:37:40,755 --> 01:37:42,381
Here we go. Okay.

1860
01:37:42,548 --> 01:37:45,467
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1861
01:37:48,388 --> 01:37:49,388
Nice.

1862
01:37:50,056 --> 01:37:51,890
Nice. Okay.

1863
01:37:52,058 --> 01:37:53,308
Pull me up.

1864
01:37:53,476 --> 01:37:55,268
I'm ready. Go.

1865
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:57,229
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

1866
01:37:57,397 --> 01:37:59,856
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

1867
01:38:00,024 --> 01:38:02,025
- Pull harder.
- Dale' come on.

1868
01:38:02,193 --> 01:38:04,903
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1869
01:38:05,071 --> 01:38:07,906
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

1870
01:38:10,827 --> 01:38:11,868
Dale!

1871
01:38:12,036 --> 01:38:13,578
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1872
01:38:15,373 --> 01:38:18,583
Go ahead and run' you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1873
01:39:46,255 --> 01:39:48,089
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1874
01:39:48,257 --> 01:39:49,466
Okay.

1875
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:14,115
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1876
01:40:14,283 --> 01:40:15,450
Now!

1877
01:40:30,383 --> 01:40:31,508
Fuck you!

1878
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,558
Fuck the police!

1879
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:02,414
Motherfucking kill you!

1880
01:41:04,834 --> 01:41:07,377
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

1881
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:09,963
Oh' shit!

1882
01:41:10,131 --> 01:41:11,339
Come here!

1883
01:41:18,681 --> 01:41:20,599
I hate you!

1884
01:41:20,766 --> 01:41:23,059
No! Ted, stop it!

1885
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,902
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1886
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:35,030
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1887
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:44,080
Jesus!

1888
01:41:51,464 --> 01:41:53,006
Fuck.

1889
01:42:02,266 --> 01:42:03,808
Gonna die.

1890
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:08,813
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

1891
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:11,816
But you weren't gonna stop.

1892
01:42:18,366 --> 01:42:19,949
Shoot him!

1893
01:42:20,117 --> 01:42:22,452
Just take it easy, buddy.

1894
01:42:24,205 --> 01:42:26,581
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1895
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:31,503
I'm hungry.

1896
01:42:31,671 --> 01:42:33,588
I'm going home.

1897
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,177
All right.

1898
01:42:40,763 --> 01:42:42,430
Help.

1899
01:42:45,184 --> 01:42:46,935
I knew you were going soft.

1900
01:42:47,103 --> 01:42:50,188
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

1901
01:42:50,356 --> 01:42:52,440

01:43:00,449 --> 01:43:04,244
- Look, I didn't Wanna hit you' man...

You think you was gonna

01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:11,710
You need to sit

All right. This is hoW it ends.

1911
01:43:37,737 --> 01:43:41,865
You just got killed by a

01:43:42,032 --> 01:43:43,533
How you like me now, huh?

1913

Red?

1915
01:43:47,706 --> 01:43:48,873
Saul.

1916
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:51,918
Hey, Saul. I came back for you' bro.

1917
01:43:52,086 --> 01:43:53,753

01:43:54,588 --> 01:43:56,089
Bro's before ho's.

1919
01:43:56,799 --> 01:43:59,759
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1920
01:43:59,927 --> 01:44:04,388
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1921
01:44:04,556 --> 01:44:08,142
Honestly, like' from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

1922
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:12,105
...and' like, from seeing this asshole's

1923
01:44:12,272 --> 01:44:15,274

01:44:16,068 --> 01:44:18,945
I fucking love you' dog.

1925
01:44:19,571 --> 01:44:21,656
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1926
01:44:22,908 --> 01:44:24,659
No more lies, Red.

1927
01:44:24,827 --> 01:44:27,370
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

1928
01:44:29,957 --> 01:44:31,457
Red!

1929
01:44:49,143 --> 01:44:52,061
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1930
01:44:52,229 --> 01:44:54,105
Red' I'm coming, baby.

1931
01:44:54,273 --> 01:44:56,691
Your stupidity amazes me.

1932
01:44:59,111 --> 01:45:00,862
Hey, Ted!

1933
01:45:01,029 --> 01:45:02,989
You killed my brother...

1934
01:45:03,157 --> 01:45:06,284
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

01:45:06,451 --> 01:45:09,495
Suck my balls! TWo times!

1936

Bitch!

1937
01:45:18,589 --> 01:45:20,131
Bring it on.

1938
01:45:31,727 --> 01:45:32,768
Shit. Dale.

1939
01:45:34,313 --> 01:45:36,522
Dale!

1940
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:38,357
Holy shit!

1941
01:46:14,853 --> 01:46:15,895
Sorry' Ted.

1942
01:46:20,067 --> 01:46:22,026
Yo?'ve been served.

1943
01:46:29,159 --> 01:46:34,622
Oh' shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1944
01:46:38,919 --> 01:46:40,544
Sa?l! Sa?l!

Wake up, man! This place

Come to me!

1947

Yo?'re not dying today, friend.

1948
01:46:55,102 --> 01:46:57,979
Not on my watch.

1949
01:47:24,965 --> 01:47:28,175
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1950
01:47:28,343 --> 01:47:29,802
Saul.

1951
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:31,470
Wake up.

1952
01:47:31,638 --> 01:47:34,056
Oh' sweet Saul.

1953
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,270
Saul.

1954
01:47:42,107 --> 01:47:43,899
Yes. Yeah.

1955
01:47:44,067 --> 01:47:45,526
Saul, you made it.

1956
01:47:45,694 --> 01:47:48,237
- What?
- Yeah.

1957
01:47:48,405 --> 01:47:50,323
Where am I?

1958
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:52,533
You made it' man.

1959
01:47:52,701 --> 01:47:55,244
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

1960
01:47:55,412 --> 01:47:58,456
- Yeah.
- Oh' thank you.

1961
01:47:58,623 --> 01:48:01,334
What happened?

1962
01:48:07,841 --> 01:48:10,259
Holy shit.

1963
01:48:14,181 --> 01:48:15,890
What's that?

1964
01:48:18,685 --> 01:48:20,519
Hi.

1965
01:48:20,687 --> 01:48:22,563
- Red?
- Red?

1966
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,194
- Red.
- Hey.

1967
01:48:28,362 --> 01:48:31,697
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1968
01:48:31,865 --> 01:48:32,948
He came back to save us.

1969
01:48:33,116 --> 01:48:34,200
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

1970
01:48:34,368 --> 01:48:35,785
All right, man.

1971
01:48:35,952 --> 01:48:38,079
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

1972
01:48:38,246 --> 01:48:41,123
Oh' man. We made it, guys.

1973
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:44,919
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1974
01:48:50,384 --> 01:48:55,346
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.
I am Dale Denton.

01:48:55,514 --> 01:48:59,350
The topic of the day: New beginnings.
Getting over losses.

01:48:59,518 --> 01:49:01,894
Friends. Life.

1977
01:49:02,062 --> 01:49:04,688
We have our first caller.

1978
01:49:04,856 --> 01:49:07,483
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1979
01:49:07,651 --> 01:49:09,276
Hi. Am I on the air?

1980
01:49:09,444 --> 01:49:12,488
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1981
01:49:12,656 --> 01:49:13,739
A D in the face.

1982
01:49:13,907 --> 01:49:15,241
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

1983
01:49:15,409 --> 01:49:20,079
You're my hero.

1984
01:49:20,747 --> 01:49:22,248
You are good, man. Seriously.

1985
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:24,333
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1986
01:49:24,501 --> 01:49:26,502
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

1987
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:29,463
- It's not bad' huh?
- Lf I close my eyes' it sounds like...

1988
01:49:29,631 --> 01:49:32,758
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1989
01:49:32,926 --> 01:49:35,761
- Lf you were on it' I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

1990
01:49:35,929 --> 01:49:38,305
It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...

1991
01:49:38,473 --> 01:49:40,307
...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.

1992
01:49:40,475 --> 01:49:43,269
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1993
01:49:43,437 --> 01:49:46,063
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

1994
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:48,315
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

1995
01:49:48,483 --> 01:49:50,276
...I like you now.

1996
01:49:50,444 --> 01:49:53,904
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1997
01:49:54,072 --> 01:49:56,115
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

1998
01:49:56,283 --> 01:49:59,493
Seriously. You guys are' like,
both of my best friends.

1999
01:49:59,661 --> 01:50:02,455
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

2000
01:50:02,622 --> 01:50:04,832
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

2001
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,417
We should get a three-way one.

2002
01:50:06,585 --> 01:50:10,212
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

2003
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:13,299
I want the middle piece'
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

2004
01:50:13,467 --> 01:50:17,386
I know We've gone over this, but, like'
1000 pardons' 1000 pardons, please.

2005
01:50:17,554 --> 01:50:20,306
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

2006
01:50:20,474 --> 01:50:22,975
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

2007
01:50:23,143 --> 01:50:26,020
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

2008
01:50:26,188 --> 01:50:29,064
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

2009
01:50:29,232 --> 01:50:31,984
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

2010
01:50:32,152 --> 01:50:33,694
Is that us getting a time-share?

2011
01:50:33,862 --> 01:50:36,280
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

2012
01:50:36,448 --> 01:50:38,824
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

2013
01:50:38,992 --> 01:50:41,535
You hit me with a DustBuster' man.

2014
01:50:41,703 --> 01:50:44,830
I didn't Wanna hurt you.
It was like' "You better not leave here."

2015
01:50:44,998 --> 01:50:46,999
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

2016
01:50:47,167 --> 01:50:48,626
You fuckhead.

2017
01:50:48,793 --> 01:50:51,337
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

2018
01:50:51,505 --> 01:50:54,131
- Are you kidding me? Oh' my God.
- Yeah, it was...

2019
01:50:54,299 --> 01:50:57,218
I, like' had my foot
through the window.

2020
01:50:57,385 --> 01:51:01,430
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

2021
01:51:03,183 --> 01:51:06,393
- I just feel different about everything.
- Me too, man. Everything.

2022
01:51:06,561 --> 01:51:08,646
Like, I never Wanna
kill anybody else again.

2023
01:51:08,813 --> 01:51:10,689
- Ever.
- That's something you pretty much...

2024
01:51:10,857 --> 01:51:12,691
You can just kind of
dip your toes into.

2025
01:51:12,859 --> 01:51:14,735
We kind of dipped our toes
into murder.

2026
01:51:14,903 --> 01:51:17,363
I killed six guys, I think.
How many guys did you...?

2027
01:51:17,531 --> 01:51:19,406
- We each shot several people.
- A lot.

2028
01:51:19,574 --> 01:51:21,575
Some people get a taste for it'
but I don't.

2029
01:51:21,743 --> 01:51:24,870
I shot someone who was already dead
so that doesn't count as a murder.

2030
01:51:25,038 --> 01:51:27,206
Apparently you hit him
with your car, I'm told.

2031
01:51:27,374 --> 01:51:29,917
- That... You killed him.
- Okay, so I did murder somebody.

2032
01:51:30,085 --> 01:51:32,419
- You murdered, man.
- Not a big deal. That's cool.

2033
01:51:32,587 --> 01:51:35,172
- That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.
- I know.

2034
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,132
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

2035
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,510
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

2036
01:51:39,678 --> 01:51:43,138
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood leff?

2037
01:51:43,306 --> 01:51:46,141
- You've been shot' like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

2038
01:51:46,309 --> 01:51:48,060
- You're losing stuft.
- Yeah.

2039
01:51:48,228 --> 01:51:50,104
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

2040
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:53,732
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

2041
01:51:55,944 --> 01:51:58,404
It's a miracle.
I think We should all take a moment...

2042
01:51:58,572 --> 01:52:01,156
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

2043
01:52:01,324 --> 01:52:03,325
And that we became friends
in the process...

2044
01:52:03,493 --> 01:52:05,744
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

2045
01:52:05,912 --> 01:52:10,124
Should we touch each other's hands
while We do it? Okay.

2046
01:52:12,168 --> 01:52:13,585
I love you guys.

2047
01:52:13,753 --> 01:52:16,129
I love you dudes so much.

2048
01:52:19,050 --> 01:52:21,718
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

2049
01:52:22,595 --> 01:52:24,054
- Red?
- Red?

2050
01:52:24,222 --> 01:52:26,223
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

2051
01:52:26,391 --> 01:52:27,724
What's up, pal?

2052
01:52:28,643 --> 01:52:30,143
- Hey.
- Hey.

2053
01:52:30,311 --> 01:52:34,022
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

2054
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:36,441
That's okay. We Won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

2055
01:52:36,609 --> 01:52:40,070
- Oh' God.
- Hey' there's bubbe.

2056
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:42,364
Come on. Let's get out of here.

2057
01:52:42,532 --> 01:52:44,449
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

2058
01:52:44,617 --> 01:52:46,743
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

2059
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:48,829
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

2060
01:52:48,996 --> 01:52:51,248
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

2061
01:52:51,416 --> 01:52:53,500
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

2062
01:52:53,668 --> 01:52:56,712
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

2063
01:52:56,879 --> 01:52:58,755
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

2064
01:52:58,923 --> 01:53:00,507
Blood from my ear just...

2065
01:53:00,675 --> 01:53:03,468
You guys smell like shit.

2066
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:07,347
You are in serious danger.

2067
01:53:10,348 --> 01:53:20,348
