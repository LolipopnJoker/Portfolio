359
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,319
No, stay back!
Stop! Stay away from me.

360
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,870
I'm warning you, stay back!
No, no, stop! I said stay away!

361
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,913
Okay, okay.

362
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,638
Max. Max.
What?

363
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,753
Wait, no, no, no. You said my name.
What did you just say?

364
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,696
Max, Max, Max.
MOLLY: Everything okay up there?

365
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,631
Max, Max.
What? What do you want?

366
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,314
Put down the weapon, Max.
Remain calm.

367
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,836

What are you, some kind of a robot?

silicon-based life form.

My name is, uh...

370
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,759
Hold on. It's one...
It's something that rhymes with...

371
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,796
I got this. Hold on. Uh...

but the important thing is...

375
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,576
I found you and now that...

376
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600

I am from...

Yes!

Yeah.

everything that's trying to kill us.

383

Oh, my God. This is insane.

384
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,076
You had an insane
amount of energy. Wait!

385
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,256
Chronometer. Clock. Timepiece.

386
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,315
MAX: Energy?

387
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,792
Whoo! Cartography. Map.
Wait, wait, Steel.

388
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,176
What is this?
Oh, what is that?

389
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,918
MAX: What do you know
about my energy?

390
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,348
No, stop. No, stop.

391
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,714

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Yes, Max?

MOLLY: Max, what are you
doing up there?

395
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,710
Oh, God, my mom is coming.
You have to hide.

396
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,075
Is "my mom" dangerous?

397
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,390
What? No, no, no! Come on!

398
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,629

399

You got to clean in here, bud.

402
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,296
Are you okay?
What's with all the yelling?

403
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Yeah, I'm fine.

404
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,039
I just... I had a bad dream.
Fell out of bed.

405
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,436
You were out cold last night.

406
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,616
You were already asleep when I got home.
Do you feel okay?

407
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,838
I'm fine. I... Growth spurt.

Uh, nothing. It's just my
video games are going.

410
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,238
I need to get your laundry.
No!

411
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,595
I can do my own laundry
from now on. Okay?

412
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,912

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,672
And you're gonna be late.
All right.

414
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,496
(GASPS) I had a dream, too, Max.
There was explosions and screaming.

415
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,748
Oh! Oh! I got it. I got it.

416
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,752
What are you doing? Get off me!
Why did you do that?

417
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,718
There was another buildup of
energy within you. I absorbed it.

418
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,836
MOLLY: Max!
You're welcome.

419
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,112
Okay, look, I'll just take you
back to where you found me,

420
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,952
and you can phone home,
or whatever.

421
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,270
No, no, no, Max. Listen, you
are gonna be generating

422
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,280
that tachyon energy for the rest of
your life. And that is all that I eat.

423

actually starve to death.

we are together forever.

427
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,136
All right, I want to know
everything that you know right now.

428
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,309
Okay.

429
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,639
Okay. Well, how about
the energy? The tachyon stuff.

430
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,976
Let's start with that.
Sounds good. Let's do it.

431
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Where did it come from?

432
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,076
Uh, pass.

433
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Did you do this to me?

434
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,153
No, I think
you did this to me.

435
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,440
You woke me up.
I was sleeping.

436
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Is it gonna kill me?

437
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,754
Yes! If I'm not around.

438
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,536
Apparently, you don't realize
how lucky you were

439
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,595
that I was there
yesterday

440
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,280
to relieve you of
your excesses in energy

441
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,833
'cause you were
about to explode.

442
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,751
Explode. Right. I got it.
Jinx.

443
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,736
So, what? You're like some
kind of a space vampire then?

444
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,671
More like your space buddy.
Whoa. Heads up.

445
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,871
Excuse me,
Max, why are we hiding?

446
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,839
Because you're an alien.

447
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,576
They're gonna, like,
dissect you, or something.

448
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,910
Dissect. To cut open
a deceased organism for study.

449
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,281
But, Max, that doesn't make
sense 'cause I'm not deceased.

450
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,112
Good job, Max.
Now, watch this.

451
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,231

452

No, don't, no.

453
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,114
It's okay. They didn't see us.

They shot, like, real bullets at us!

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,029
They did seem angry.

459
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,679
Who wants to kill you?

460
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,034

Who wants to kill us?

461
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,656
Oh, come on. You have to
remember something.

462
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,433

everything I remember.

but I saw you.

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,948
It was your memory. Why would
I see one of your memories?

listening to me.

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,232
Yeah, I just...
STEEL: Come on, buddy.

529
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,312
Maybe we can talk
about this later. I have to run.

530
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,632
I'm really late
for my Zumba class.

531
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
(CHUCKLES)

532
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,096
STEEL: The girl creature
appears to cause

533
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,236
increases in heart
rate and respiration.

534
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,311
Perhaps you should
avoid contact with her.

535
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,719
Perhaps you should shut up.

536
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,279
STEEL: See?
She has made you angry.

537
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,556
Okay, we should be good here.

538
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,313
STEEL: I don't know, Max.
It seems like that girl creature

539
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,392
must have put out some kind
of mind control virus on you.

540
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,754
We should probably kill her.

541
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,957
What? No.

542
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,759
And her name is Sofia,
by the way. She's...

543
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,358
She's a cyborg.

544
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,509
She's, uh...

545
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,559
She's a war machine. A snail. An alien!
No, no, I'm an alien.

546
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,073
She's not dangerous.

547
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,559
Okay, okay.
Agree to disagree.

548
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,313
What are we gonna do, Steel?
We can't stay here all day.

549
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,358
Well, yeah, but perhaps
"my mom" can help us.

550
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,634
You claim she's an ally.

551
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,776
No, I can't dump this on her.

552
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,840
All my life, she's been like
insane about my health.

553
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,148
Taking me to
all these doctors.

554
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,496
If she knew what was
happening, she'd...

555
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,953
Oh! Excuse me one second.

556
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,515
Will you cut that out!

557
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,635
STEEL: No, it's okay.

558
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,029
No, I will not cut it out.

559
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,759
When you get worked up,
you generate energy.

560
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,035
Clearly, "my mom"
makes you upset.

561
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,438
No, she's just...

562
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,999
It just sucks.
What?

563
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,638
Everything that
happened with my dad,

564
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,296
she just kept moving us
from place to place.

565
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,438
Yeah. I know.
Yeah, no, I get it, right.

566
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,717
What's up?
Why am I telling you this?

567
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,076
Because I'm here for you, Max.
I'm here to protect you.

568
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,230
Which means
you can tell me anything.

569
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,949
Max?

570
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,274
You know, sometimes I just
wish my dad was still here.

571
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,477
That I could,
I don't know, talk to him,

572
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,475
or even know what
his laugh sounded like.

573
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,032
I don't even know him,
but I miss him.

574
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,319
I understand.

575
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,477
I don't even know where my
home is, but I miss it, too.

576
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,029
Right.

577
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,834
I'm sorry.

578
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,479
Nah, it's coolio. I was just kind
of going off your vibe anyway.

579
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,136
Although it could
help if you could

580
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,416
remember who was
trying to kill you.

581
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,873
Hey, us.
You.

582
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,856
All right, look, if you can just
remember something, I don't know.

583
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,793
Maybe more from the memory
that we saw, it might help us.

584
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,720
Um...
Here. Max, look.

585
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,836
What, this?
You remember N-Tek?

586
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,229
They attacked it.
They will come for us.

587
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,788
Wait, what?
The guys in the black vans?

588
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,757
No, the Ultralinks.

589
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,832
They always come for us.

590
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,115
Come on.

591
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,671
Uh, just... No trespassing.

592

Looks pretty serious to me.

594
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,558

(WATER DRIPPING)

596
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,508
Okay, so, if you don't
remember any details,

597
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,216
how do we trigger
that memory thing that we had?

598
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,160
Does anything around here
remind you of anything?

599
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240

600
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,912
What?

601
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,112
No, you go and then I'll go.
I thought you had something.

602
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,031
Steel, come on.

603
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,314
Oh! Don't move. I got you.

604
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,469
No, Steel, wait, no!

605
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,471
Will you stop!

606
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,994
Nah, I'm probably
gonna keep doing it.

607
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,434
How did you do that?

608
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,232
I didn't. We did.

609
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,040
I've been telling you,
if we work together,

610
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,718
we can
harmonize tachyon energy

611
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,874
so that it becomes far-cart-tar...
Turbo energy!

612
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,838
Turbo? Really?

613
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,911
Yes. Yes. It's very powerful.

614
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,076
The energy can enhance
your physical attributes.

615
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160

616

617
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,037

but fast.

That was incredible!

620
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,036
Not bad.
Try something else.

621
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,359
That's impressive.

But, Max, do you know
what's even more impressive?

623
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,871
My knowledge of
battle strategy.

624

upon volumes of extensive...

it's super, super scary.

manipulate the elements.

night wasn't an accident at all.

686

had him for a partner

too short a time.

ask you about my dad.

the night that he died?

everything was gone.

of harnessing energy

has ever attempted.

friend and a true genius,

796
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,710

To leap before he looked.

797
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,976

he was playing with...

what are you saying?

That the accident
was his fault?

sometimes we all have a tendency

too far for what we want.

are here to destroy the Earth

thing that can stop them.

I fought alongside your father.

fend off the Ultralinks

borrowed my phone and my car,

I was exposed to that energy

01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,754
Why haven't they come for me?

1224
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,029
I don't know.

1225
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,509
Maybe because
you didn't have the power yet.

1226
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,910
But you're a threat now
and they'll come for you.

1227
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,559
I thought I could
protect you, but I can't.

1228
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,155
You know you're not exactly
making me feel any better.

1229
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,558
But I do know
one thing, okay?

1230
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,631
You will not have
to do this alone.

1231
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,389
I love you, bud.

1232
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,072
I love you, too, Mom.

1233
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,320
(SIGHS)

1234
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Hey.

1235
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,791
I've held on to
this for too long.

1236
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,830
Now it belongs to you.

1237
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,309
I don't understand.

1238
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,279
You will.

1239
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
(DOOR CLOSES)

1240
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,039
Steel.

1241
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,354
Show me.

1242
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,552
He'll need to know where he
came from to know who he is.

1243
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,636
(JIM AND MOLLY LAUGHING)

1244
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,913
Thanks, Dad.

1245
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,200
(KNOCKING)

1246
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,440
(DOOR OPENS)

1247
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,395
Hey.

1248
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,515
You're okay.

1249
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,431
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

1250
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,154
Where have you been?

1251
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,576
Uh, it's kind of
a crazy story.

1252
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,635
Try me.

1253
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,599
Listen, um...

1254
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,269
I just came by to let you know
that you were right about me.

1255
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,435
I'm used to being alone and I'm
actually pretty good at it.

1256
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,235
Um, when I moved here,

1257
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,456
I thought that
this was just gonna be

1258
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,994
like every other
town I've lived in.

1259
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,993
And then you showed up.

1260
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,032
Uh, thank you for noticing me.

1261
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,197
What's this?

1262
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,280
Open it.

1263
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:30,869
Uh, there.

1264
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,960
(CHUCKLES)

1265
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,558
We have a lot to talk about.

1266
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,640
Uh-huh.

1267
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,350
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Uh, maybe
we could, I don't know,

1268
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,355
go on that tour that you were
talking about in the car.

1269
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,794
How's tonight?

1270
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,110
Yeah, only if you
don't bail on me.

1271
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,269
Never. Right.

1272
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,360
Right. Uh-huh.

1273
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,520
(CHUCKLES)

1274
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,715
I'll see you later,
Max McGrath.

1275
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,195
Okay.

1276
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,640
Oh, wow.

1277
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,680
STEEL: Okay, maybe it was
good we didn't kill her.

1278
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,073
Yeah, you think?

1279
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,148
Flight mode?

1280
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,389
Flight mode.

1281
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,948
I like flight mode.

1282
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,816
MAX: (GROANS) Steel, this suit
seems tighter than usual.

1283
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,856
Really? We're flying and you're
complaining about the suit?

1284
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,313
MAX: Go right.
STEEL: Let's go left.

1285
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,400
MAX: No. Let's go right.

1286
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,536
STEEL: How about
your other right?

1287
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,896
MAX: You know what?
Let's just go straight then.

1288
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,911
STEEL: Okay.
